Mr. Eden is aware that it might be more convenient for Lord Zetland to furnish such observations of the views of His Majesty's Procurator-General upon the two points on which his aavice is sought in paragraph 11 of the letter were first available, but for the reasons given in paragraph 12 he is anxious that a decision as to the future policy of His Majesty's Government towards this question shall be reached as soon as possible.

A similar letter is being addressed to the Treasury and Admiralty and a copy is being sent to His Majesty's Procurator-General. 1 am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (SD.)G.W.Rendel. The Under-secretary cf state, India Office.E 3725/3725/34. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 7th December, 1936. sir, 1 am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to inform you that he would be glad of your advice in regard to certain diificulties which stand in the way of any serious attempt to secure a settlement of the outstanding claims of British subjects and corporations against the Persian Government. 2. The claims in question, some of which date from as much as forty years ago, were recently the subject of a detailed examination by Mr. Hugh Ritchie, a retired official of the Foreign Office with much experience in this kind of work, who in audition to preparing a brief history of each individual claim, also wrote a memorandum or general review analysing the different categories of claims and the principles whiah might be held to govern the degree of support which His Majesty’s Government could properly accord them. A copy of this memorandum (Confidential 11683) is enclosed j_or your convenience, but a perusal cf its contents is not essential to an understanding of the questions discussed below. 3. An examination of the information collected by Mr. Ritchie has shown that a great many of the claims which have been presented to the Persian Government in the past are either supported by insufficient evidence to warrant the expectation that they could be successfully sustained before an impartial tribunal or else relate to events for which the Persian Government cannot be held to be liable according to the accepted principles of international law and practice. This examination is not yet complete, but at an approximate estimate it may be said that the face value of the claims His Majesty*s for/ Procurator-General. /for which, taking all the circumstances into account, the Persian Government - or any other Government - could reasonaoly be held to be liable, for which adequate evidence is available or is likely to be forthcoming if required, and for which at least an even chance of success can reasonably be anticipated before an impartial tribunal amounts to no more than about £300,000. Of these tenable claims the most important are those of the Persian Railway Syndicate (for expenses incurred in making surveys for the Persian Government - over £200,000), the Persian Transport Company (for losses arising from the arbitrary cancellation of a concession for the building of a road - £50,000) and the Government of India (for sums owing on account of the salaries of officers lent to the Persian Government for quarantine service in the Persian Gulf - about £5,000, this being strictly speaking, however, a debt rather than a claim^ 4. It has so far proved impossible, in spite of repeated representations through the diplomatic channel, to induce the Persian Government to examine or settle any of these claims hope of ever inducing them to do so new is to set up some kind of a claims commission or arbitral tribunal for the examination of Persian claims against His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India as well as British claims against the Persian Government. In the course of certain negotiations, which lasted from 1928 to 1934, for a general Treaty with the Persian Government to cover a variety cf oustanding Anglo-Persian issues, it was contan plated that arrangements should be made to set up a claims commission; and it is not impossible that the Persian Government would agree without much difficulty to such a commission to-day, even in the absence of a general treaty, provided no attempt on their own merits, and it can safely be said that the only J was /3. 6./ was made to exclude from consideration ab initio their war Claims against His Majesty’s Government and in particular one such claim known as the Atychides claim. 5. This claim relates to a steamship known as the ’’Hamadan” or ’’Kara leniz”, the property of a naturalised Persian subject, of Ottoman origin, named Socrates Atychides. This vessel was detained at Bombay, prior to the outbreak of war 1 with Turkey in 1914, on the ground that, notwithstanding a purported transfer to the Persian flag, it was really an Ottoman vessel. The ship was subsequently condemned as a prize by the High Court of Bombay. This case has formed the subject of examination in your oifice in the past, in 1918, when an opinion dated 21st December, 1918 was written by Dr. Pearce Higgins, and also in 1932 ana 1933, when the merits of the claim were discussed among various Government departments, in connexion with the expressed indention of the Persian Government to bring the claim before the League of Nations and in connexion with a request from M. Atychides for an interview with His Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris (see your letter of 2nd May, 1933). A copy oi Lr. Pearce Higgins' opinion is enclosed for convenience of reference, together with a memorandum of 21st September, 1934, by Mr. Ritchie, and a diary (prepared in this department) of the events, as far as at present known, which led up to the vessel's condemnation as a prize in 1914. To this diary is attached as an annex a list of six points in regard to which the course of events is somewhat obscure and about which the India Office have recently been asked semi-officially to endeavour to obtain further information. It will be seen from these documents that two principal points arise; (a) whether the Bombay authorities were justified in detaining the vessel prior to the outbreak of war with Turkey and (b) whether the vessel was thereafter rightly condemned as a prize.4. 6. With regard to (a) the following opinion was expressed by your office in 1933 (see Admiralty letter M.659/33 of 28th February, 1933, of which a copy was sent to your department by the Foreign Office): ’•The Bombay Government ao not suggest any peculiar provision of the local municipal law justifying the action of their port officer. The general position in international law appears to be fairly plain. A ship sailing the High Seas and visiting foreign territorial waters must possess a nationality, and her nationality is that of the flag she properly carries. The conditions on v/hich Stages admit ships to their Register are not the concern of international law. It suffices that - for whatever reasons - a State accepts the authority and responsibility which result from the ship’s nationality. The ship's right to carry her flag should be vouched by some public official document on board her. M In this case, therefore, the port officer was justified in detaining the 'Kara Deniz' until satisfied of her right to carry the Persian flag, but 1 do not think he was acting v correctly in saying that he would not recognise the alleged change of nationality from Turkish to Persian until the ship’s register had been produced. 1 think he should have been of the Persian Consul and a certificate of Persian nationality of this department have long inclined to the opinion that if the claim were to be submitted to an impartial tribunal, the satisfied as to her nationality so soon as the Turkish Consul-General’s statement had been confirmed by the statement had been issued by the latter official'. On the strength of this and similar expressions of opinion, the legal advisers tribunal would probably decide that so far as the administra tive actions of the Bombay authorities were concerned the vessel had been improperly or at any rate unreasonably detained. Against this, however, may be set the fact that M./Ax* Atyciiid.es, or alternatively his agent or the master of the vessel, might have applied to the High Court under Section 45 of the Indian Specific Relief Act of 1877 for a declaration that the detention of the vessel was illegal, and that he failed to do so. 7. With regard to (b) the question is fully discussed in the Judgments of 11th March, 1915, and 9th June, 1919, Judgment delivered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy uhe dilliculty which arises from the fact that at the time when the vessel was seized His Majesty^ Government had voluntarily accepted and were applying the provisions of Articles 55 and 57 of the Declaration of London, and that under Article 55 it is at the least extremely doubtful whether the vessel could have been condemned. it is true that the time when the case was heard in Bombay His Majesty's Government had ceased to apply these provisions, but it is at any rate a possibility that an international tribunal would hold that the validity of the capture must be determined 'I according to the law which was in force at the time when the capture too place. Moreover, apart from this point, the principle under which the vessel was ultimately condemned was a principle of prize law only as understood in this counury and theUnited States, and at variance with the continental rule. Unless it were expressly provided that tne case was to be determined according to Anglo-Saxon prize law it is at any rate possible that the tribunal would apply the continental rule. b. it is thereiore apparent that if this claim were to be brought before any kind of arbitral tribunal, His Majesty's Government might, as the result of this one case alone and leaving aside the remaining Persian claims, about which of the prize Division of theHigh Court at Bombay, and in the Council on 5th July, 1922. But Mr. gden is impressed by little/t little, if anything, is known, except that they exist, be placed in the position of having to pay damages to the extent of anything up to £900,000, the figure at which M.Atychides places his losses, including losses of earnings; and it is unlikely that the damages would be reduced even if His Majesty's Government were to decline on principle to submit the prize decision to arbitration and were to restrict the issue before the tribunal to that of the detention of the vessel at Bombay prior to the outbreak of war. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government can obviously not agree to the submission of this claim to arbitration without the most serious consideration. 9. During the treaty negotiations referred to in paragraph 4 above, His Majesty's Government hoped to be able to secure the exclusion of the Atychiaes claim from the scope of any Anglo-Persian claims commission by proposing, when the time came for a detailed discussion of the categories of claims of which the commission should take cognisance, that all claims arising out of events which took place during the world •*, war should be excluded. But it must be admitted that there was never much prospect that these tactics would have succeeded. if in the course of the treaty negotiations the stage had been reached of discussing the scope of the commission with the Persian Government, thepersian Government might well have been willing to exclude war claims in general, since they have always maintained that they are in no way responsible for events occurring during the occupation of the country by foreign troops. But had they done so th§y would certainly have wished to define the term 'war claims' in such a way as to ensure that the Atychiaes claim was not thus excluded, and any attempt by His Majesty's Government to insist on its exclusion on this or any other ground would merely have ended in the abandonment of the whole idea of a claims commission. There is no reason to anticipate that they/( 5 ) 7. they would take a different line to-day and Mr. Eden sees no prospect of inducing them to accept a claims commission unless His Majesty’s Government are prepared to allow the Atychides claim to come before the commission or tribunal and to oppose it on its merits. In the absence of a clear understanding that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to take this line it seems preferable to avoid even suggesting a general claims commission, since the negotiations for its establishment could otherwise only end in failure. 10. It will be seen from the foregoing explanations that a diificult question of principle arises. Are His Majesty’s Government justified in depriving British claimants generally of their last, and in fact their only, hope of repayment, however slender that may be, because of the existence of a Persian counter-claim against His Majesty's Government (or at any rate against the Government of India) which in no way concerns the claimants in question and which might be found by an impartial commission, noLwithstanding the aecisions of the prize Courts, to have considerable justification? 11. In view of this difficulty it would be of great assistance to Mr. Eden in considering the question further if he might be informed of your opinion as to: (1) Whether the objections of principle to submitting prize court judgments to review by any kind of international court or tribunal must be held to apply without qualification to the present case, notwithstanding any special circumstances connected therewith. (2) If so, whether the same objections would apply to the review by some international court or tribunal, not of the prize court judgments as such, i.e. the c ondemnation/condemnation of the 'Kara Deniz' as a prize on the ground that she was an enemy vessel seized in Indian waters on the outbreak of war, but of the decision, which is expressed or inherent in the judgments that, the detention of the vessel at Bombay during the v/eeks preceding the outbreak of war was either justified, or irrelevant to the issue before the court. (3) If His Majesty's Government were to agree to submit the case to some international court or tribunal, whether a judgment adverse to His Majesty's Government would belikely to be given. 12. I am to add that, although the question of British claims against the Persian Government is one of many years' standing and is in a sense not urgent, yet nevertheless, owing to the fact that, since the suspension of the negotiations for a General Treaty setting up inter alia a claims commission, it has become increasingly difficult to meet the enquiries of those claimants v/ho ask what steps are being taken by His Majesty's Government on their behalf, Mr. Eden would be grateful if he might receive your observations on this letter at as early a date as you can conveniently furnish them. 13. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Treasury, Admiralty and the India Office, under cover of letters of which a copy is enclosed herewith. I am etc. (Sd.) G.W.

(Intlld.) A.W.B. 21st December, 1936. awb/dfwHist December, 1936. T. &amp; M* 20879 Sir, In reply to Mr. Renders letter (No. E.3725/3725/34) of the 7th instant regarding the proposals under consideration for the settlement of outstanding claims of British subjects and corporations against the Persian Government, and requesting for the assistance of Mr. Secretary Eden my opinion on thethree questions set out in paragraph 11 thereof, I have to request you to be so good as to inform Mr. Eden that I was concerned with the Prize proceedings in the case of the s.s. 'Kara Deniz' only in two specific aspects: First, in regard to grounds on which the Government of India might move the Prize Court at Bombay to pronounce the condemnation of the vessel as prize; and secondly, the representation of the Crown on the subsequent appeal to His Majesty's Privy Council. I was not in particular in any way concerned in the action taken in regard to the vessel prior to the seizure in prize. Dealing with the specific matters upon which my opinion is at present desired, in answer to the first question I have to say that I see nothing in the special circumstances of the case of the 'Kara Deniz' afiecting the generally accepted opinion that it is objectionable to submit Prize Court Judgments to review by an International Court or Tribunal. It must be remembered that the principles of Prize Court law which can be said to have been so widely accepted as to form a recognised part of international law are very few indeed, and do not include those/2 . . those acted upon on this case, and that the decisions of British Courts of Prize undoubtedly bear a strong impress of the desire to justify by such grounds of logic as may be discovered the actions at sea of a country which has always tended to rely on preponderant sea power for the enforcement of its politices. In my opinion there must be very serious doubt whether the decision of one of our prize Courts in any case, and in particular in the case now umer consideration, would be held justified by an International Court. In this connection it may not be without interest to refer to the concluding words of the preface to Professor Yerzijl’s work on Prize Law in the Great &gt;/ar; 'This jurisprudence includes decisions of such illegality that, faced with them, no neutral can remain silent'. Objection was raised to many decisions of the Prize Courts on the ground of unfairness and injustice, and to agree now generally to review any one decision might lead to pressure which it would be difficult to resist to review others. With regard to the second question now put to me, the issue of the prize Court proceedings would appear sufficiently to show that the detention of the vessel at Bombay during the weeks preceding the outbreak of war was a matter irrelevant to those proceedings, that is a question so connected with the constitution and jurisdiction of the Prize Court that I find it difficult to imagine that it is one which could be submitted to review by an International Court, since the constitution of Prize Courts is a matter depending on the policy of the Government setting them up. That the alleged detention/detention in question was or was not justified is a question which might no doubt be investigated by an International Court, and the general objections referred to in my answer to the first question do not seem applicable to such a reference as there is nob - so far as I am aware - any similar case. The third question upon which my opinion is asked depends for its decision on general considerations of international law and of other matters beyond those properly v/ithin the jurisdiction of the Procurator General. My personal opinion, for what it may be worth, is that if the case of the 'Kara Deniz' is referred to an International Court a judgment generally adverse to His Majesty's Government is probable. The long alleged detention of the vessel could not be justified as an embargo in contemplation of war, as no such embargo was declared, ar^d it seems to have been the only case of such a detention; an embargo of this character in the words of Sir Travers Twiss, 'cannot well be distinguished from a breach of good faith to the parties who are the subject of it'. Moreover, Foreign Office letter Ho.T.6239/395/370 of the 8th June, 1928, to the Persian Minister in effect denied that there was detention of the vessel due to any unauthorised action on the part of the Port Authorities at Bombay, and alleged that the ship was not in a condition to leave port owing to the loss of an essential portion of the machinery. In view of that letter it would, I think, now be difficult to set up any argument that the detention was rightly made by authority of His Majesty's Government. If the grounds of the condemnation of the vessel should be reviewed by an International Court, it must bepreviously referred to, and in any event His Majesty’s /-n Government could hardly argue that though not bound by the provisions of Article 57 of the Declaration of London, they might yet take advantage of the more stringent conditions introduced by Article 55. The difficulties of attempting to refer in connection with a case of wide interest a limited question / only to an International Court, and the broad discussions and comment to which an apparently narrow technical issue may give rise, are perhaps well illustrated by the proceedings in the matter of the arbitration before a Swedish Arbitrator in the recent case concerning the requisition during the war of certain Finnish owned vessels, and I can only say that in my opinion any agreement to refer the facts connected with the seizure and condemnation of the s.s. ’’Kara Deniz' to an International Court must be expected to result in a decision unfavourable in part if not wholly to His Majesty's Government. I do not, of course, suggest that for this reason it may not be right or politic that any such reference be accepted. There would be no objection from my point of view if, whilst maintaining the decision, nevertheless as a term of a general bargain, it should as a matter of policy be agreed to waive the benefit thereof or some part of that benefit. For such an agreement effecting prize seizures during the war there are several precedents. A copy of this letter is being forwarded for information to the Treasury, to the Admiralty and to the Foreign Office. I am etc. (Sd.) A.W.

Samuel Hoare to Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen [Tehran). Foreign Office, August 30, 1935. THE dossiers relating to British claims against the Persian Government which were transmitted to the Foreign Office by Sir Reginald Hoare in 1933 (see his despatches No. 69 of the 18th February, 1933, and No. 162 of the 7th April, 1933) have now been examined by Mr. Hugh Ritchie, C.M.G. 2 . Ihe results of this examination are embodied in four volumes, entitled respectively :— ( 1 ) Persia Claims (General Review). ( 2 ) Persia (Legation Claims). (3) Persia : Consulate Claims (Peace Time). (4) Persia : Consulate Claims (War Time). No. ( 1 ) consists of the “ General Review,” which is a summary of the historical aspects of the question, and copies of Sir R. Hoare’s despatches Nos. 69 and 162 of 1933, while Nos. ( 2 ), (3) and (4) consist of memoranda on the individual claims, preceded in each case by an index and a brief introduction. 3. The ‘ ‘ General Review ’ ’ and the three volumes of memoranda have been prepared by Mr. Ritchie in single copies only. I do not propose to have further copies of the memoranda made at present, but I have caused the “ General Review ” to be printed and now enclose six copies for retention in His Majesty’s Legation. The index and introduction to each of the three supplementarv volumes have also been printed as appendices to the “General Review.” A further appendix is a list showing in tabular form the sums involved in the various classes of claims, as quoted by Mr. Ritchie in the relevant paragraphs of his “ General Review.” The object of printing each index is to render exactly apparent the form in which the information regarding these claims is available in the Foreign Office and thus to facilitate the submission of any requests for further information respecting particular claims which you or your successors may wish to make in future years. 4. I am now considering what steps can be taken in the hope of eventually securing a settlement of such of the claims as it is possible for His Majesty’s Government to support and I shall address you upon this question in a later despatch.

General Review.* I. 1. In his despatch No. 69 of the 18th February, 1933, Sir R. Hoare enclosed (±pp® ndix L comprehensive lists of all our claims preferred in the past against the Persian authorities and still outstanding, so far as these could be traced in the Legation and in our consulates in the outlying districts of Persia. In a further despatch, No. 162 of the 7th April, 1933, he enclosed a short supplementary list, mainly relating to losses incurred by the staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia during the war. These lists had been in course of preparation for some ten years, and they were accompanied by files of the Legation correspondence, so far as this could be furnished, and by statements and documents supplied by the fourteen consulates, so far as their existing archives, which had suffered depletion during the war, permitted. 2. In his despatch No. 69, Sir R. Hoare disposed these claims in five groups :— (A) The Legation Claims, i.e., a main body of claims dealt with at Tehran— set out in a schedule. (B) The Consulate Claims, i.e., those returned by the various consulates, under instructions sent by the Legation in 1924—set out in separate lists. (C) Denials of Justice, i.e., those in which proceedings in the local courts in the past had failed to procure justice—set out in Annex III to the despatch. (D) Imperial Bank of Persia Claims for the looting of their branches during the war—summarised in Annex IV. (E) Staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia for their private losses, mainly during the war—set out in the supplementary list. 3. The distinction between (A) the Legation claims and (B) the consulate claims results from the procedure followed in Persia (in all but a few instances) that a claimant lodged his claim with the British consul in whose district it arose. In his annual report for 1911, Sir G. Barclay, our former Minister (referring to highway robberies), said the practice was that, as soon as a claim was presented to His Majesty’s consular officer (in the district concerned), it was notified by him to the (Persian) Foreign Office Agent and the Governor, and every effort was made to induce the local authorities to take immediate steps for the recapture and restitution of the stolen property; when no further prospect of settlement in this direction appeared, the more important cases were referred to His Majesty’s Legation; a statement was then submitted to the Persian Government, who were warned that, failing a settlement locally, the value of the losses would be claimed from the Central Government. The annual reports of the time show that a tabular statement of British claims filed at the Legation was forwarded annually towards the close of the year to the Persian Govern ment, setting out the amounts claimed in respect of Tehran and each of the other British consulates; in 1913, e.g., the amount thus claimed was £119,022. This practice was maintained until 1918, after which it was dropped. It follows that, while we may expect from our Legation evidence as regards claims lodged at Tehran, we are mainly dependent on returns furnished by our consulates else where as regards claims originally lodged with them. 4 . The claims comprised in the five groups range from 1892 to 1930— nearly forty years; a period that saw many changes in Persia, and a develop ment from semi-barbarous conditions under which but a loose control was exercised over the component tribes, to the somewhat more stable conditions of the present day. Originally, the Government was an absolute monarchy, resembling in temporal matters that of the former Ottoman Empire, the country being divided into satrapies or provinces, with Governors who were appointed by, and responsible to, the Crown; in 1906 a Constitution was granted by the * The original of this memorandum is bound together with Appendices 1 and 2 below in a volume entitled Persia Claims (General Review) (Persia 36). [115411 B 2Shah, which was confirmed by his successors; recently foreign capitulatory rights have lapsed. During the greater part of this period the local conditions appear to have afforded but a scanty security to life and property; brigandage was rife; disturbances among the tribes owing allegiance to the Shah often led to more serious outrages. From these causes the great majority of our claims arose; others originated during the war from incidents fostered by the intrigues of enemy agents and the irruption of enemy troops; others, again, from the P on ^ fulfilment by the Persian Government of certain alleged contractual obligation?^* In the following paragraphs the claims are dealt with under the headings ((A), (B), (C), (D), (E)) assigned to them in Sir R. Hoare’s despatch; later they are examined in the light of general questions to which they give rise; and later still in the light of the attitude of the Persian Government towards them. II. (A)— The Legation Claims. 5. The main schedule of the Legation claims sets out a list of ninety-seven claims (really ninety-eight), with short details about each. Some of them are marked as settled. Files of original correspondence about many of them are sent. This correspondence is at best incomplete; in many instances it is wholly wanting, either because it cannot now be traced, or is in old archives sent to this Office, or relates to matters already within the knowledge of this Department. It has been necessary therefore to reconstruct from available sources the outstanding Legation claims to see how they stand, and this has been done in a series of memoranda, which, with an index, are bound consecutively in a separate volume entitled Legation Claims, detailing each, tabulating the facts and analysing as far as possible the issues involved. Claims which arose during the war period (taken to be from the 4th August, 1914, to the 22nd February, 1921) are headed in each case “ War.” 6 . This investigation eliminates a few of the Legation claims as having no good foundation. The others, with the values claimed, may be classified as follows :— (1) Highway robberies and outrages. Peace-time : 281,430-23 krans, £971 2s. Id., and 450 rupees. War-time: 775,535-65 krans, £47,024 7s. 5d. Total: 1,056,965 -88 krans, £47,995 10 s. 0d., and 450 rupees. (2) Outrages on British officials and others. War-time: 680,931-22 krans and £38,640. (3) Losses on evacuations of Persian towns. War-time : 967,406 -95 krans and £563 13s. 9d. (4) Losses in Meshed riots (1905). Messrs. Richards : 6,962 -40 dollars, with 12 per cent, compound interest. (5) Losses in revolution (1909). T. Casey and Mrs. Rizzo : £1,200 and 1,000 krans. ( 6 ) S.S. Shushan. Loss on working from 1902 to 1913. Messrs. Lynch or Persian Transport Company : 2,302,905 -7 krans. (7) S.S. Shushan. Attacks on. 1902 and 1904. Messrs. Lynch : 10,663 krans. ( 8 ) Kasr-i-Dokhtar Toll-house. Demolition of and loss of tolls. 1906-10. Persian Transport Company: 68,751-35 krans. (9) Sir W. Haig. Breach of undertaking to employ in Persian Service, 1919 : £4,807. ( 10 ) Mesopotamia Persia Corporation. War-time losses on wheat bought for Messrs. Lynch : 66,382-50 krans. ( 11 ) Rev. E. O. Eshoo. War-time depredations in Urumia : 275,594 krans. ( 12 ) Persian Transport Company. Cancellation of concessions, 1921 : £50,000 (formerly £75.900 18,9. 6 ^.). (13) Persian Railway Syndicate. Cost of surveys, 1913-4, 1920-21 : £202,207, with 7 per cent, compound interest. (14) British Quarantine Medical Officers in Persian Gulf. Arrears of salaries, 1923-24: 69,967-10 rupees; and 16,814-60 krans. (Besides the above, Richards’s (Reichardt’s) Forestry Concession. for which he claimed £15,000, is included in the Legation schedule, but this claim, which is outlined on pp. 235 to 240 of the volume Legation Claims, was abandoned by us in 1932.)7. In Annex V the Legation assess the total value of the Legation or Tehran claims at 4,746,364 Rrans, £483,458, 70,417 rupees, and 6,962-40 dollars. The investigation made here, as shown above, makes the total 5,447,415-20 krans, £345,413 3s. 9fi?., 70,41710 rupees, and 6,962-40 dollars. Some of this difference may be accounted for by the fact that many claimants claim in krans, with a sterling equivalent; some by the inclusion or non-inclusion of interest; and some Ly the elimination of a few claims that are unsound. In either case the amount ■s large, but the figures are necessarily provisional. In some instances interest at a high rate is claimed; in others at a less rate; in others not at all. Precise documentary evidence of the losses alleged to have been sustained is not furnished, except in certain cases of outrages during the war and in the claim of Mr. T. Casey. One claim (No. 13 in the Legation schedule) for extensive high way robberies in 1910 is not valued, the claimants, it is said, not having yet formulated their claims, which may yet be presented by underwriters; while in another (No. 31 in the Legation schedule), the Legation surmise that part may have been paid out of Rushire surplus customs revenues during the British occupation of that port. 8 . Of the claims, as classified in paragraph 6 above— ( 1 ) Highway robberies are dealt with more fully hereafter in paragraphs 45-50. (2) and (3) War claims in paragraphs 51-56. (4) Investigation shows to be somewhat weak on principles underlying international law. (5) There is no precise evidence of Mrs. Rizzo’s losses. ( 6 ) The largest is more than doubtful, and has been characterised here in the past as somewhat absurd. (7) While committed on Persian territory, depends to an extent whether Turks or Persians committed the outrage. ( 8 ) There seems ground for thinking this claim was extinguished in 1913-14. (9) Sir W. Haig afterwards offered to take £2,500. ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) These are obscure cases in which there is no sufficient evidence furnished to show Persian liability. (12), (13) and (14) These are more important claims concerning which there is correspondence here. 9. It will be seen, therefore, that the Legation claims, as detailed at length in the separate volume Legation Claims, are in some instances open to question, and are in most cases unaccompanied by any precise documentary evidence of the losses alleged to have been incurred. In the circumstances it would be difficult to frame any estimate of their intrinsic values, and, consequently, of the total of such values. The figures given above can but represent the total of the various amounts claimed, and these, so far as one can judge, are sometimes based on generous estimates. This lack of documentary evidence is commented on later in paragraphs 31-36. 10. Of claims marked in the Legation schedule as settled, it is noted that— One case (Mr. Hubbard) for wounding, was settled in 1917 by a payment of £2,000 from the Seistan Grain Account. Three cases (one for murder in 1915, and two for highway robberies in 1921-22) were settled by the Indo-European Telegraph Department by pay ments of in all 290,770-75 krans from their Terminal Rate and Traffic Accounts; to which the Persian Government seemingly assented. Three cases (for cotton appropriated by Germans in 1915, for robbery and wounding in 1918, and a part payment for Shiraz outrages in 1915) were settled by payments of 98,954 krans out of Sir P. Sykes’s Fines Account. Nine cases (mainly for loss of life and wounding at Shiraz, Bushire and Isfahan in 1915) were settled by payments of £21,064 11s. and 387,500 krans out of Bushire revenues during British occupation, while it is said (under Claim No. 31), that others may have been. It appears, therefore, that some important claims (noted in the volume Legation Claims), were either compulsorily settled by us during the war period out of Persian funds; or otherwise, with the apparent assent of the Persian6 Government; or, in some seven cases of highway robbery, settled to the extent of £3,581 and 72,282, though whether by the Central Government or the Local Administrations is doubtful. 11. In the case of certain of the outrages on British consular officers or their staffs during the war period, advances were made by the Treasury or Government of India, or both conjointly, to afford relief to the victims of these outrages, the sums advanced to form a first charge on amounts which might be eventually recovered from the Persian Government. These advances are referred to in the volume Legation Claims, but their full extent is not evident from the documents furnished; it can no doubt be readily ascertained if and when any final settlement should be reached with the Persian Government as regards payment of war claims. In a letter from the India Office of the 24th June, 1929. relative to Indian claims, amounts so advanced were said to total £28,000, but this figure may be found to fall short of the combined payments under this head; while it is also shown in our correspondence here that considerable expenditure was incurred in the removal to places of safety of British communities from Persian towns evacuated during the war period. The total of all these payments must amount to a large sum. (B )—The Consulate Claims. 12 . The lists of the consulate claims show in all 626 separate claims. These lists result from a circular sent by our Legation on the 29th July, 1924, to His Majesty’s consular officers in Persia, instructing them to examine claims registered in their respective districts in the light of Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions, and decide into which of the following categories they fell:— (a) Claims which, in their opinion, clearly arose from the action or inaction of the Persian Government or its officials, and in support of which sufficient evidence is now available to pursue them at once. (h) Claims which clearly lie against the Persian Government, but which are not backed by really complete and adequate evidence. {c) Claims which are not worthy of presentation to the Persian Government either through lack of evidence or owing to the fact that the Persian Government was neither directly nor indirectly responsible for the circumstances in which they arose. The consuls were at the same time instructed to furnish a detailed statement of each claim, setting out the name and address of the claimant, his status, date of claim, the circumstances, amount, &amp;c.; to attach certified copies of the documen tary evidence available; and to give their reasons for assigning each claim to category (a), (b) or (c) . 13. The lists furnished summarise the returns made by fourteen consulates: Ahwaz, Bandar Abbas, Bushire, Hamadan, Isfahan, Kerman, Kermanshah. Meshed, Resht, Seistan, Shiraz, Sultanabad, Tabriz and Yezd; and short details are added of each claim. In some of these lists the claims are fully classified as (a), (b) or (c) in accordance with the circular; in others they are only partly classified; in one instance, Kermanshah, they are not classified. Bundles of documents are supplied by the respective consulates; these in some cases cover (a), (b) and (c) claims; in others (a) and (b) only: in the case of Kermanshah there are none. 14. The notes furnished by our Legation on the consulate claims say— Of Ahwaz, that all correspondence is missing there, and that the list is compiled from papers in the Legation archives. Of Bandar Abbas (where there are twenty-one unclassified cases), that no trace of many of the papers can be found in the Legation or consular archives. Of Bushire (where there are 120 unclassified cases), that no trace of some of the claims mentioned in the list can be found. Of Kerman (where there are sixty-two unclassified cases), that it is not clear why only a few cases are submitted by the consul in detail; there is no information about the others. t »Of Kermanshah (where there are fifty-four unclassified cases), that only a list is available, all archives having been destroyed during the war period. Of Meshed, that it is recommended that most of the claims submitted (eleven in number) should be dropped. Of Seistan, that further claims adumbrated have never been received. Of Tabriz, that of the claims submitted some are scantily documented. 15. It is apparent from the deficiencies mentioned above, and from others mentioned below, that the 626 claims set out in the consulate lists must suffer a very considerable reduction owing to lack of any evidence now to establish them. And though the Legation, in Annex V, assess the total value of these consulate claims at 4,446,688 krans, £22,959, 215,000 rupees, and 238 -40 dollars, it seems clear that without sufficient evidence to support these figures they could not stand the test of any tribunal. It seems necessary therefore at the outset to confine ourselves to such claims as have at least some evidence to support them, and these, for the purpose of investigation, must be those placed by the consuls in categories (a) and (b). Some few in category (c) might also be given consideration. 16. The number of consulate claims to merit examination is thus summarily reduced from 626 to 274 (apart from the few (c) cases), and these 274 claims are each set out in two separate volumes, Consulate Claims: Peace-Time and Consulate Claims: War-Time, showing the facts and the evidence furnished in support of each. In the first (or larger) volume, there are set out in chronological order, with indexes, claims which arose in times of peace, arranged as highway robberies (placed in the separated categories {a), (b) and {c) ), followed by miscellaneous claims under their respective heads. In the second (or smaller) volume, war-time claims are similarly arranged chronologically, with indexes. In the following paragraphs, however, they are briefly classified according as they are returned by the consuls in the categories (a), (b) and (c), with observations on each of these categories, the claims placed therein and the reasons assigned by the consuls for placing them there. 17. Category {a). —Claims placed by the consuls in category (a) are returned as in their opinion clearly arising from the action or inaction of the Persian Government or its officials, and in support of which sufficient evidence is available to pursue them at once. They may be classified, with the amounts claimed, as follows, distinguishing between peace-time claims and war-time claims :— Peace-time (145 cases). Highway robberies, 1894 to 1928 (101 cases): 1,324,738-90 krans, £1,129 9s. 3&lt;i., 12,061 11 rupees. Assault, 1913 (1 case) : £100. Burglaries and caravanserai robberies, 1898 to 1924 (7 cases) : 89,831-50 krans, £824 19s. 8 ^., 3,030 -2 rupees. Civil disturbances— Lingah, 1899 (3 cases) : 49,849 -11-9 rupees. Bushire, 1909 (4 cases) : 3,441-5 krans, £72, 21 rupees. Consulate-general, Isfahan, damage to, 1907 : 4,660 krans. Customs losses, 1897 to 1904, short delivery (5 cases) : 11,749 krans; refund of duty claimed : 2,120-25 krans; illegal fine : £60. Debt for barracks construction, 1914: 566,322-62 krans (originally about 97,516-60 krans). Murder, 1905 : 2,375 rupees. Piracies, 1904 to 1913 (3 cases) : 41,099 rupees. Postal losses, 1897 to 1899 (2 cases) : 7,362 krans. Requisitions, 1928 to 1929 (2 cases) : 16,944 krans. Thefts, 1907 to 1912 (2 cases) : 140 krans, £28. Tribal raids, 1908 to 1912 (8 cases) : 56.058-50 krans, 2,846-1-0 rupees. War-time (57 cases). Highway robberies (43 cases): 478,899-15 krans, £6,268 10s. 0d., 1,990 rupees. Burglaries (2 cases) : 3,100 krans.Evacuation of Persian towns (7 cases) : 237,789-75 krans. Murders— Aga Ferrukh Khan : 30,000 rupees. Consulate Sowar : 25,000 rupees. Postal losses : £4 195. Oo?. Resht disturbances (1920-21) : 62.620 krans. Theft (peculation by Deputy-Governor) : 2,400 krans. Tribal raid : 2,352 krans. 18. The above claims placed in category (a) yield a total of peace-time claims of 2,083,368-27 krans, £2,214 85 . 11^., and 111,282-5-9 rupees—and of war-time claims of 787,160-90 krans, £6,273-9-0, and 56.990 rupees—or a combined total in the 202 claims of 2,870,529-17 krans, £8,487 175. lid., and 168,272-5-9 rupees. Highway robberies form the greater part, it being held by the consuls that it was the plain duty of the Persian Government to safeguard the public highways. But the figures, like those of the Legation claims, can only be regarded as provisional. There are a number of weak spots. Interest at an excessive rate is sometimes claimed—the claim for barracks construction in 1914 (the claimant, Mr. Haycock, now seems to be dead), e.g., is more than five times the original debt. Burglaries we appear to have decided in 1925 not to claim for, (E 3485/3485/34 though seemingly on grounds of policy and as likely to prejudice other and more oM 925 y) 034 important claims. Thefts, our Legation once told the Persian Government in 1923, might elude the vigilance of the police. Peculation by a Persian Deputy- (See para. 47 .) Governor seems a matter he was personally liable for. Civil riots at Lingah in 1899, and at Bushire in 1909 (the year of the revolution), raise questions of liability in international law; and in the former case the promise to defray British losses came from a local Governor now dead. Customs losses, many Governments deny liability for. The claims for evacuations of Persian towns in war-time include one for 180.000 krans by Messrs. Ziegler for the removal of their entire establishment from Sultanabad in 1921, which, on the facts shown, has but small prospect of success. 19. It cannot be said either that the allocation of claims by the respective consuls to category {a) has been performed with any great regard to the terms of Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions, to which their attention was specially directed by the Legation in its circular of 1924. Some of the claims placed in this category are well supported by evidence; some are imperfectly supported; some are backed by no evidence except the consul’s own statement of the facts. There is a wide range. In the volume Consulate Claims, in which the various claims are set out in detail chronologically, analysis has been made of the evidence furnished in each claim under the heads— ( 1 ) The claimant’s original representation. ( 2 ) The evidence of witnesses. (3) The representations made to the local Administration. (4) The notifications made to His Majesty’s Legation. (5) The sworn depositions of the claimants. It will be seen that in most cases we are not furnished with complete documentary evidence on these points. 20. There are also manifest differences of view among the consuls, both as regards offences for which the Persian Government may be deemed liable, and the grounds on which claims may be included in category (a). One return excludes looting of caravanserais as approximating to burglaries, which it also excludes; returns from elsewhere include both. One return excludes claims where no answer can be traced from the local authorities to representations made to them; other returns include claims wherever due notification was made to the local authorities. One return excludes claims because the robbers came from without the consul’s district; other returns include claims whatever the local jurisdiction. At Isfahan the consul in 1925 required many claimants to furnish statutory declarations in respect of past events before including them in category (a)\ if they failed they went into category (b) or (c); most other consuls did not make this requirement. At Shiraz, where the consul w T as similarly exacting, Messrs. Ziegler, who have more claims than any other firm, furnished at a late hour, after the returns had been made up, a comprehensive affidavit which mighthave the effect of translating 18 of their claims placed in category (b) into category (a), and which gives additional validity to five of their claims placed in category (c). 21 . These differences doubtless arise from differences of opinion in different minds as to the degree of exactness requisite to form a claim valid both in substance and in evidence, as claims placed in category (a) might be presumed to ^e; and to this former habits and customs in Persia in the making of claims have probably contributed. But while weight must seemingly be attached to the views of the consuls on the spot that the claims they have placed in category (a) are claims which (in the words of the Legation circular of 1924) either arose from the action or inaction of the Persian Government or its officials, or otherwise lie clearly against that Government, it is evident that in dealing here with such claims they can only be dealt with according to their legal sufficiency or insufficiency, on the evidence available, or which may yet become available, to meet the test of whatever tribunal they may be eventually brought before. It is to be feared, therefore, that the number of those placed in category (a) by the consuls will suffer further reduction on this account. 22. Category (b). —The claims placed in category (b) are returned by five consulates alone, viz., Isfahan. Kerman, Shiraz, Tabriz and Yezd—as lying clearly against the Persian Government, though not backed by really complete and adequate evidence. They number 72 cases, relating almost entirely to highway robberies, though a few are for other forms of robbery, and one for war-time depredations in Urumia. They may be classified as follows, distinguishing again between those which occurred in peace-time and war-time. Peace-time (62 cases). Highway robberies, 1907 to 1921 (57 cases): 366,312-91 krans, £4,328 Os. lid. Caravanserai robbery, 1911 : £ 35 . Civil disturbances, Kazerun, March 1914 (2 cases): 2.062-50 krans £1,079. Tribal raids, 1912-13 (2 cases) : 21,767 krans. War-time (10 cases). Highway robberies (9 cases) : 124,679-07 krans, £2,367 3 s. Od. Urumia, depredations in : 200,000 krans. 23. These category (b) claims, some of which cover more than one claimant, yield an aggregate of peace-time claims of 390.142-41 krans, and £5,442 0s. lid. —and of war-time claims of 324,679 07 krans, and £2,367 3 s. 0 d.; or a combined total of 714,821 -48 krans, and £7,809 3s. lid. The evidence furnished in support of them, though incomplete, is in a good many instances not very different from that furnished in some of the category {a) claims, and it is set out in the volumes Consulate Claims in each case. The reasons assigned by the consuls for placing the claims in category (b) are as follows :— At Isfahan, because the claimants have not responded, or have been unable to respond, to requests made in 1925 that they should furnish further affidavits in support of their original claims, which are nevertheless just claims, never disputed. At Kerman, because the claims are old and the claimants difficult to trace or dead. At Shiraz, because firms being in liquidation the liquidator is now unable to furnish affidavits; or because the correspondence, or part of it, with the local administration cannot now be traced; or because the local administration never replied to the representation made; or because the muleteer’s statement is not now available; or because the robbers came from a neighbouring jurisdiction, &amp;c. : the claims being nevertheless just claims against Persia. At Tabriz, because the claim is not backed by complete and adequate evidence. At Yezd, because the claim fell to be dealt with by another British consulate; or because the identity of robbers and the locality of the occurrence does not appear. J [11541] c24. The claimants in these category (b) cases are mostly British firms, o London, Manchester or Bombay, and they include a former Anglican bishop in Persia (who, however, furnished an affidavit) and the Imperial Bank ot Peisia. It seems possible that if some of these claimants learned that any settlement or claims was in prospect, they might be prepared to come forward with additional evidence in support of their original claims. Messrs. Ziegler (as mentioned in paragraph 20 above) have already done so, and other British firms and claimanjj have within recent times made enquiries of us as regards any possible settlemew of their claims. 25. Category (c) and the Unclassified Cases. —The claims placed by the consuls in category (c) are those not deemed worthy of presentation to the Persian Government either through lack of evidence or because that Government was not responsible. Together with the unclassified cases, they amount to 352 in number. As regards those placed in category (c), inspection of the documents which are sent as a rule bears out the view that they are not worth pursuing; but there are a few which might warrant consideration, and the facts and evidence in these selected cases are set out in the volume Consulate Claims. In the unclassified cases no documents whatever are furnished. Many of the claims in both groups are in respect of loans, bills unpaid, small thefts, debts of one kind or another, and similar minor matters which afford no sufficient basis for claiming against the Persian Government; and, though there are some others more serious for highway robberies, plunder, customs fines, and even piracy and murder, these relate for the most part to Orientals, are wanting in evidence, and have been rejected by our consuls for such reasons as that the claimant is not now traceable, that no documentary evidence is now available, that the Persian authorities cannot be held responsible, or sometimes that the claimant has been found not to possess British nationality. There are, however, among these groups some British firms of standing who might yet be prepared, if any prospect of settlement were in sight, to bring forward further evidence in support of the claims they originally lodged, and which they have no doubt long since regarded as unlikely ever to be settled. 26. Kermanshah List. —Among the unclassified cases are those arising at Kermanshah, where all the consular archives were destroyed during war-time, and the Legation archives concerning them similarly destroyed. With these we can apparently do nothing in the absence of any documentary evidence to establish them. There are over fifty cases on that list, extending from 1907 to 1914, mainly for highway robberies and other losses during local disturbances, and it is said that frequent representations were made at the times of occurrence to the local administration, while the total amount claimed is assessed at 380,244-30 krans. These claims are mostly by Orientals, but there are among them some important items for highway robberies by Messrs. Sykes and Co. for 40.000 krans in 1912; Messrs. David and Sons for 21,927 krans in 1912; Messrs. Ziegler for 14,000 krans in 1911-12; Messrs. Isaac and Co. for 27.000 krans in 1910; besides smaller claims by Messrs. D. Sassoon and Co., the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and even by His Majesty’s Government; there is also one by Consul McDouall for 7,635 krans supplementary to his claim (Legation Claim No. 69) for evacuation losses. Here again some of the claimants might be prepared to furnish additional evidence from their books of the losses they originally claimed for. 27. The examination of the consulate claims shows then that of the 626 claims originally lodged with our consulates in Persia in respect of losses and outrages of one kind or another suffered by British subjects or British-protected persons, or their property, in the past, only 274 are now deemed eligible for inclusion in categories (a) and (5); while some 350 placed in category (c) or unclassified are not now deemed capable of being advanced, owing to the neo-lect of the Persian authorities to afford any remedy to the injured parties at^ the time, and the loss or disappearance since of any sufficient evidence to enable them now to be pursued. And, further, that of the 274 cases returned in categories (a) and (b) some are in respect of offences which it is doubtful can be laid at the door of the Persian Government, while others are supported by evidence so incomplete as to be insufficient for the purposes of an arbitral tribunal, thus involving a further reduction in the number of claims available for this purpose. This lack of documentary evidence is commented on later in paragraphs 31 to 36.1 } (C)— Denials of Justice. 28- Ihe claims under this head, which are assessed in Annex V at 455,o65 krans, £6,913, 11,259 rupees, and 20,000 roubles, can apparently only be mentioned in order to be dismissed. What is known of them is set out in the extracts from the Legation archives which are furnished in Annex III and in the memorandum at the end of the volume Legation Claims. In paragraphs 10 13 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, Sir R. Hoare says that only these meagre details can now be furnished, unsupported by affidavits, and that he considers it will be entirely impossible to hold the Persian Government to any responsibility for them. It is unfortunate, but there seems no alternative in the circumstances but to put them on one side. (D )—Imperial Bank of Persia Claims. 29. The claims preferred by the Imperial Bank of Persia for the looting of their branches during the war-time disturbances in Persia, amounting to nearly 6 million krans, are mentioned in the volume Legation Claims. The Legation furnish Annex IV, containing a representation made by the Tehran Bank to them on January 5, 1933, together with a statement wdiich had been prepared by the Legation themselves^) ot the events leading up to the evacuation of each branch of the bank during the war-time disturbances. This account shows that the bank have repeatedly urged their claims; that they have met with a definite refusal from the Persian Government to consider them, accompanied on the last occasion by something of the nature of a veiled threat if they persisted in advancing them further; and that our Legation have from time to 'time lent their good offices to those attempts to obtain restitution, but without any success. It occurs to one that it may perhaps not be to the best interest of the Bank in Persia to insist too strongly on restitution by the Persian Government for these war time losses, but this is a matter of which the Political Department are the best judges. Sir R. Hoare’s despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, adds in paragraph 16, that researches by the head office of the bank in London may bring to light other claims of the bank in the past which were met by insurance companies for cash looted on the roads, &amp;c. One such is furnished in Legation claim No. 114, but up to the present we seem to have no information from the head office of the bank in London of these possible additional claims. (E )—Staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia. 30. These claims are similarly set out in the volume Legation Claims. They ielate to sixteen persons, and are in the main for losses sustained during war-time. No documentary evidence is furnished in support of them, except in the one or two instances mentioned there, but Sir R. Hoare says in paragraph 15 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, that it might in some cases be possible to obtain this if thought necessary. Out of the sixteen claimants, ten are said to be Persian subjects, and he presumes that as regards these His Majesty’s Government will be unable to support their claims. He adds that it is unknown how many of their losses were met by insurance companies, but that the head office of the bank in London have been asked to prepare a statement on this point and to send it to this department direct. Apparently, however, they have not done so yet. III. General Considerations. 31. The position of the five groups of claims being thus shown, and their details set out in each case as far as possible in the separate volumes Legation Claims and Consulate Claims, the claims may now be examined in the lio-ht of general questions common to most of them. These may be ranged under the°lieads of “ Evidence,” “ Nationality of Claimants,” “ Amounts Claimed,” “ Insurance Companies,” “ Highway Robberies.” and “ War Claims.” C) Paragraph 14 of Sir K. Hoare’s despatch No 09 [11541] c v12 C Evidence. The rules laid down in Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions for guidance in the making of claims against foreign Governments may be summarised thus:— (1) All evidence of a vital nature should be obtained when the claim is first notified; the claimant must show that he is a British subject or^ British-protected person, both then and now, by sufficient documentary evidence; or, if by a company, by a certificate of registration under the Companies Acts—possibly by proof of the substantial British nationality of its members. ( 2 ) Mere signed statements or letters addressed to the consul or other people are, technically speaking, worthless; depositions should bear all necessary stamps and signatures. (3) The evidence must show not only that the loss or damage occurred, but that the Government of the country are responsible; in claims for robbery or violence, e.g., by a policeman or soldier acting under orders; or, if by a private individual, that the Government or their officers knowingly instigated it, or might have prevented it by due diligence or care. (4) In armed insurrections against a Government, the latter are not liable unless they were negligent or might have prevented the damage, or unless they compensate their own subjects or other foreigners, or unless the rebellion was successful and the insurgent party installed in power. (5) The evidence must establish with precision the dates, places and circum stances of the damage; a list as detailed as possible should be appended to a sworn affidavit; while the evidence of the claimant should be supported by the affidavits of other persons as to every part of the claim. 32. It may, perhaps, be that these rules, as set out in the Consular Instructions, are in the nature of a counsel of perfection, and as a means of ensuring that a claimant should neglect nothing that might contribute to the support of his claim. But if they are to be read as representing what we deem essential for the purpose of lodging British claims before an arbitral tribunal, then it is clear that most of our claims against Persia, in whatever category placed, would, on the evidence at present available to us, fail to meet this test; and that, in spite of the fact that most of them are on record as having been officially presented in the past to the Persian Government at or about the times of the respective occurrences, it would now be necessary that they should be supported by much more ample evidence than any yet furnished. 33. The length of time over which these claims extend (nearly 40 years) and the conditions existing in Persia during the greater part of that period, seem indeed to militate against the application to them of the rigorous tests which have been evolved out of the proceedings of international commissions set up from time to time to deal with claims preferred by one Government against another. As mentioned in paragraph 3 above the habitual method, sanctioned by usage in Persia in the past, was for claims to be handled by the local Administra tions of the various provinces or satrapies into which the country was divided, while the representation of the claim to those authorities, arising out of a local and at the time easily identifiable outrage, was directed mainly to the purpose of an immediate pursuit of the culprits, and the recovery, in whole or in part, of the property looted, and the castigation of the offenders. It is easily understood that in such circumstances less attention was paid to the framing of claims with the precision and formality now deemed necessary, than to the immediate rectification of an outrage which had occurred. On the other hand, the Persian Government, now armed with text-books recording the exactitudes of inter national procedure in the making of claims, are seemingly in a position to carrv these exactitudes into questions of the settlement of claims, which after many years still exist as claims, primarily because of their own neglect, or that of their local authorities, to afford adequate remedy to claimants at the time the events complained of arose. This appears to be a severe handicap; and the absence orloss during the interval which has elapsed of much of the original evidence furnished by the claimants is another; while the efforts made at Tehran and the various consulates to remedy these dehciencies do not seem to avail to carry us much further. 34. In paragraph 6 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, Sir R. Hoare says that as regards depositions, the consulate claims are in almost every case provided with the necessary affidavits or declarations, but that, owing to pressure of work and the large number of claims involved, it proved impossible to follow the same method as regards the Legation claims. As a result, most of the Legation claims (as shown in the tabular statement of each in the volume Legation Claims) are founded on statements only; and though in the case of outrages and losses sustained during the war period there are some statutory declarations, researches which have been made in our own archives and in those of the Board of Trade and Clearing Office, have added only a few to their number. Sir R. Hoare says that it will be comparatively simple to obtain from the claimants affidavits or declarations, if these are thought necessary, but it occurs to one that if claims are of old standing, as most of them are, this may not always prove easy, even if statutory declarations made now in respect of occurrences which took place a good many years ago had the same weight as if made at the time. In the case of the numerous highway robberies dealt with by the Legation it appears to have been the habit of Messrs. Lynch, the Persian Transport Company, or other firm, simply to notify the Legation by letter of the outrage, and for the Legation to act on such notification; and it may be that the larger firms concerned can furnish from their books records of the losses in question, duly certified. In the case of the smaller applicants, some of whom may now be dead, there may be more difficulty. However, as regards the Legation claims specified as from (4) to (14) in paragraph 6 above, we appear to be entitled to assume that the necessary documentary evidence wherewith to establish the claims advanced is in the possession of the claimants themselves, and that he, or they, ought to be in a position to furnish it. 35. The consulate claims—at any rate those placed in category {a )—are in many cases better provided with evidence, though they do not bear out the state ment made in Sir R. Hoare’s despatch that they are almost in every case provided with the necessary affidavits and declarations, for the analysis made in the volume Consulate Claims shows that less than 100 claims out of the total of 274 placed in categories (a) and ( 6 ) are so provided, while these depositions are mostly of recent date. Further, as mentioned in paragraphs 18 to 20 above, there is considerable variation in the amount of evidence furnished in these consulate claims, and in the opinions held as regards the liability of the Persian Govern ment in respect of them. And while in some instances the consuls append certified copies of the evidence available, in others the evidence is not certified; in some the evidence is given in the form of quotations in the consul’s statement of the claim, and these quotations are sometimes certified and sometimes not. This may not be very material if we were assured that the original documents exist at the various consulates; but these and the other variations mentioned seem to show that we cannot accept in their entirety claims which are returned by the respective consuls as claims which lie clearly against the Persian Government or as being supported by sufficient evidence to enable them to be pursued at once. 36. As a preliminary to this question of sufficiency of evidence, it would therefore seem necessary, if we are to pursue these claims, whether Legation or consulate, before an arbitral tribunal, to endeavour to remedy the deficiencies mentioned as far as possible. Where the returns are uncertified by the consul (notably at Shiraz) they should be certified as true copies by him; where further depositions are obtainable from the claimants, they should be obtained from them; while it may doubtless be assumed that eventually we shall publish a notice in the London Gazette calling upon claimants to furnish all further evidence of which they may be in possession in support of their various claims. When all such evidence as can be thus procured has been obtained, it will be possible to proceed to an apportionment of the claims, according to their legal sufficiency or insufficiency for the purpose in view, in accordance with such a standard of measurement as may be deemed at least a minimum requisite to place them before an arbitral tribunal.H c Nationality of Claimants. 37. In paragraph 20 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933 r Sir R. Hoare says that, so far as is known, all claims transmitted are by rhitiMi subjects, but that this cannot be guaranteed. There is, in fact, no actua documentary evidence of the British nationality of any of the claimants, apart from the statements they themselves make in such statutory declarations as aie furnished, or by the consul, that they are so registered at the consulate; or, the case of Orientals, statements made by the consul that they are registered at the consulate as British Indian subjects, or sometimes as British-protected persons. As regards the Legation claims, there can be little doubt that, with one or two possible exceptions, the claimant, whether a person or firm, is British; as regards the consulate claims, there may be doubt in the case of Orientals whether they may not be of dual nationality, and possibly Persian as well as British, since Persian nationality seems to cling to an illimitable number of generations born abroad, as the Persian Government argued in the case of Messrs. Isfahani (Legation Claim No. 92). But, with that exception, and the cases of the consular agent and clerk murdered at Lingah (Legation Claim No. 44), the Persian Government do not appear hitherto to have raised any question of the British nationality of any of the claimants, though the reason may, of course, be that they have seldom attempted hitherto to settle any claim. If they were to question it now in any individual case, it would no doubt be necessary for the claimant to furnish the proof necessary. 38. In the same paragraph of his despatch, however, Sir R. Hoare makes some qualifications, since he notes that the attitude adopted in the past by His Majesty’s Government was that anyone serving in a British institution, such as the Imperial Bank of Persia, the Indo-European Telegraph Department, or in a British consulate, was entitled to support in presenting his claim against the Persian Government. This certainly appears to have been the case, and there is a notable instance in the case of the outrage on the British consulate at Lingah (Legation Claim No. 44), where the British consular agent and his brother, a clerk in the consulate, both said to be Persians, were murdered at their posts, and we claimed from the Persian Government 35,000 tomans on this account. Presumably justification existed in the fact that the outrage was committed on a British consulate and on British consular officials. But in general it would appear that we are not entitled to advance claims against Persia on behalf of Persian subjects, whether of single or dual nationality, and this would dispose of such claims as are made by the Persian subjects on the staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia for their war losses, mentioned in paragraph 30. A mounts Claimed. 39. The totals of the amounts claimed, as computed in paragraphs 6 , 17 and 22 above, are :— Legation claims, peace-time: 2,681,564-88 krans, £259,185 25. 7d., 70,417-10 rupees and 6,962-40 dollars. Legation claims, war-time: 2,765,850-52 krans, £86,228 Is. 2d. Consulate claims, peace-time (categories (a) and (b))\ 2,473,510-68 krans, £7,656 9s. lOd and 111,282-5-9 rupees. Consulate claims, war-time (categories (a) and (b)) : 1,111,839 -97 krans £8,640 12s. and 56,990 rupees. Or a combined total of both Legation and consulate {a) and (5) claims of Peace-time claims: 5,155,075-56 krans, £266,841 12 s. &amp;d., 181,699-15-9 rupees and 6,962 -40 dollars. War-time claims: 3,877.690-49 krans, £94,868 13s. 2d., 56,990 rupees. Besides these, there are the war-time claims of the Imperial Bank of Persia for 5,952,027-80 krans for the looting of their branches in Persia, and the claims of five British members of their staff (the sixth appears in Legation Claim No. 63, &amp;c.) mainly for war-time losses, amounting to 19,894-20 krans and £ 100 , but in regard to which we have no documentary evidence. Neglecting consulate (c) claims and those unclassified cases in which no evidence is available the whole body of claims would amount to an aggregate of approximatelv 15,228,725 -60 krans, £361,810 5s. 7d., 240,305-11-9 rupees and 6,962 -40 dollars. There are further additions of interest claimed in a number of cases. &amp; - iI.) 40. In paragraph 19 of his despatch No. 69 of the 18th February, 1933, Sir R. Hoare says that it is worthy of note, since many claims are expressed in krans (normally 50 to the £), that the kran has depreciated considerably during the last twenty years, and that unless payment is made in the kran-sterling rate prevailing at the time considerable losses will result. This is no doubt the case, but, though in a few cases the equivalent of krans is mentioned, in most instances it is not, and it would be a difficult matter to translate into sterling the ever fluctuating kran, in claims which range over many years and many vicissitudes in Persian affairs. In that paragraph he assesses the approximate grand total of all the claims at the present rate of exchange at between £650,000 and £700,000, which seems to represent fairly closely the equivalents of 50 krans and some 15 rupees to the present £ sterling. The great majority of claims of all classes are expressed in krans—sometimes tomans (equal to 10 krans), though some claimants have preferred to state their claims in sterling, some (Indian) in rupees and one (with American connexions) in dollars. All these currencies seem to have suffered depreciation of late, though in unequal degrees. This question of depreciated currencies is seemingly one that might give rise to considerable argument before a tribunal if the claims were to be argued there. A good many of the claims preferred by His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India are for sterling amounts or rupees. The point is perhaps one that has come up for decision in the case of former international tribunals on the subject of claims( 2 ); but it would seem unfair, on the one hand, if claimants should be awarded what may be but a fraction of their original losses, or, on the other, that if they originally claimed in a currency now less depreciated they should have a fortuitous advantage over those who did not. 41. At the same time inspection of the amounts claimed by the various claimants leaves the impression that these are often based on a generous estimate of the losses incurred. So far as regards firms formerly trading in Persia, of which there are a large number among the claimants, it seems probable that in view of the hazards to which their merchandise was exposed when in transit through a semi-barbarous country, it could only be by placing a high price upon their goods that they could continue to carry on a profitable business. Firms like Zieglers, of Manchester, appear to have sustained huge losses (amounting in their case to about £50,000), from robberies, often repeated, but nevertheless were seemingly able to carry on a profitable business, yielding good results. Individual claims of all classes seem to show a like tendency to estimate losses at a high figure, sometimes held in check by our Legation or by the British consulate dealing with the claim. Interest again on the amount claimed is usually estimated at a high rate; 12 per cent, interest is not infrequently asked, leading to claims of which the most notable instance is that of Mr. Haycock (Isfahan Claim No. 1 , category (a )), where the total amount claimed is more than five times the original debt. Yet there appears to be no actual rule concerning the addition of interest as regards claims for losses made by one nation against another; in the absence of any treaty provision governing the matter the question of interest seems to rest entirely with the tribunal before which the claims may be brought. Insurance Companies. 42. In paragraph 17 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, Sir R. Hoare says that the question of payments by insurance companies is of importance in regard to all the claims; that he has no information whether any. and if so how many, claims were met in this way; and that he concludes that in such cases the claim should be regarded as having been transferred from the original claimant to the insurance company. This is no doubt the case—at any rate if the insurance company was British—and in former correspondence with our Legation in 1923 (and previously), we have laid stress on the fact that if a claimant was insured against loss in this way, it in no way lessened the claim. The documents furnished do not, however, throw very much light on insurance companies’ or underwriters’ claims, though it seems to have been a somewhat ordinary practice for British firms trading in Persia to insure their goods against losses, where they could find an insurance company willing to accept the risk. ( 2 ) The United States Government hold that in the absence of a stipulation to the contrary it is the custom to pay obligations established in foreign currency at the rate of exchange current at the date of payment (see case of Lieut.-Colonel Liddell’s claim against United States (1922-25).10 43 . As regards the cases shown, there are two (Legation Claims Nos. 23 and 77 ) where solicitors acting for underwriters (in one case at least unnamed) claimed in respect of goods insured and stolen, and another (No. 13a) in which Messrs. Roditi claimed compensation for goods which had been looted, part of which they said would have to be refunded to unnamed underwriters. 1 here is a recent claim on behalf of underwriters (Legation Claim No. 114) for some £11,403 for sealed bank-notes stolen en route from Resht to Tehran, advanced^ by the Imperial Bank of Persia. In the Isfahan (category (a)) list of claims, Messrs. Ziegler, acting for insurers, claim various amounts in sixteen cases of highway robberies, with a substantial addition of interest. In the same list the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, acting on behalf of Lloyds, claim for a high way robbery; and in the Isfahan ( 6 ) list there is a claim for a highway robbery by a firm whose loss had been defrayed by London underwriters. We are also to expect from the Imperial Bank of Persia (see paragraph 30) information as to how many of their official claims, and also those of members of their staff, have been met by insurance companies. 44. But in general there is little mention of underwriters, and it looks as if they have been backward in prosecuting their claims, perhaps because they saw little prospect of recovery. Some evidence of this is afforded by the entry in the Legation schedule against claim No. 13, where it is said of extensive highway robberies committed by one Naib Hussein in 1910 that the claim has not yet been formulated by Messrs. Lynch, but may be submitted by the insurance company. Surely in the course of twenty-four years they should have formulated their claims before this. But it would not be surprising'if a good many insurance companies or underwriters asserted claims in the event of any possible settlement with the Persian Government, and this is a factor which must seemingly be taken into account. Highway Robberies. 45 . Claims for highway robberies form by far the greatest proportion of the claims recorded in the Legation and consulate lists. On the computation made in paragraphs 6 , 17 and 22 above, they amount in the aggregate to about 3,351-596 krans, £62,088 135. 2d., and 14,501-11 rupees, besides others for assaults, murder, &amp;c., which are separately classified, and others either placed by consuls in category (c) or unclassified, concerning which documentary evidence is now either insufficient or wholly absent. It was undoubtedly the custom of the past to hold the Persian Government to full responsibility for these robberies and outrages, which if not compensated by the local Administration of the province in which they took place, then became claims against the Central Government. It does not appear from the Tehran annual reports of the past that many of the claims thus notified to the Central Government were ever settled by them, but this was ascribed to the dilatory tactics of the Persian Government or to their chronic financial straits. There is enough to show that the Persian Government admitted their responsibility to take measures to repair the wrong done, and that compensation was afforded in a number of instances, though whether the amounts were paid by the Central Government or by the local Administration concerned is not apparent—probably the latter. 46. Questions of divided responsibility sometimes arose. In one of these in 1906 we find that our Legation called the attention of the Persian Government to a distinct assurance given by the Shah that a law would be passed making all Governors responsible for losses occurring in their districts, irrespective of the domicile of the robbers. In 1909 Sir G. Barclay reminded the Persian Govern ment that under article 3 of Messrs. Lynch’s Road Concession that Government had bound itself to provide protection of the traffic on the roads. And as late as 1923, Sir P. Loraine in a note to the Persian Government—after the latter had observed that robberies take place in all countries—pointed out the clear distinction which must be drawn between highway robberies and ordinary thefts; an ordinary thief, he said, might elude the vigilance of the police, but highway robbers in order to commit their depredations, profited by the absence of the security which it was the duty of every organised State to provide for all persons using the high roads on their lawful occasions; it was because of the absence of a proper degree of security on the high roads which had been noticeable for many years past in Persia that His Majesty’s Government held the Persian Govern ment responsible for losses sustained by their subjects through highway robbery;17 ^ ' if the Persian Government declined this responsibility he had yet to learn on whom they considered it devolved; he would continue under the instructions o his Government to hold the Persian Government responsible, and to press t em to afford proper compensation to the victims of such robberies, especially in cases where the property was not recovered. . 47. The matter appears first to have come under legal consideration here in ^ -1 .923, when the question of the form of tribunal before which our claims mig oe brought arose, since the Persian Government had by this time declined any responsibility beyond that of taking steps to trace robbers and reco\ti goo s stolen. In view of this attitude Sir W. Malkin considered it could be but an arbitral tribunal with a neutral umpire, and he thought that if o^r claims were brought before such a tribunal we must face the fact that many of them, it not a , might be rejected, either because the liability of the Persian Government could not be established in law, or because sufficient evidence in support of the claims would not be forthcoming. Sir C. Hurst, however, feared that an arbitral tribunal, presided over by a neutral, acting on strictly judicial lines, and on what he considered a strict application of the legal principles involved, might lead to the rejection of many claims, and he thought friendly discussion in the firs instance preferable; in this event agreement reached on individual claims should be accepted and extended to cover groups of claims; where agreements were not reached, an issue or issues should be submitted to a claims tribunal; it this procedure were adopted, it would be necessary for claimants to produce reason able evidence that there were such circumstances of neglect or malpractice on the part of the Persian authorities as to render the Persian Government habl^ 48. The matter was then further discussed at a meeting in this office in April 1924, at which Sir P. Loraine was present, when it was decided that the interests of the claimants would be best served by a preliminary examination ot the claims between representatives of the Persian Government and ot our Legation at Tehran, any claims of Persians against His Majesty s Government or British institutions being similarly referred to this preliminary commission; decisions arrived at as to the validity of claims being accepted as final; while an exchange of notes might serve to place on record that where the representatives failed to reach agreement as to the validity of a claim or where the Persian Government repudiated responsibility, the next step would be a reference of the claim or claims to a Claims Commission with a neutral umpire. 49. The outcome of this preliminary consultation with the Persian Govern ment is referred to in paragraph 60 below. It would seem however, from the above that in Sir C. Hurst’s view the test of validity would depend upon the claimant being in a position to produce reasonable evidence that there were such circumstances of neglect or malpractice on the part of the Persian authorities as to render the Persian Government liable. That there was neglect to safeguard the public highways in Persia is, of course, evident; 'these robberies and outrages were of constant, often daily, occurrence; had they taken place in any Western country they would have undoubtedly led to the strongest representations and large demands for damages from Governments whose nationals might have been the victims of these attacks and spoliations; that such outrages and robberies habitually took place in Persia cannot be denied—there is a large volume of evidence to show it—and the onus seems rather to rest on the Persian Government of justifying a neglect to maintain law and order and to safeguard life and property in territories over which they claimed sovereignty and jurisdiction, which is a duty that devolves upon every responsible Government. But if any distinction is to be drawn between neglect and malpractice we must seemmgl\ rely on the former. There are, indeed, a few instances which might suggest malpractice, as where it is alleged that the road guards quitted their duty or that the gendarmerie in charge of the road saw nothing, or that premises robbed were supposed to be guarded by Persian soldiers. But in general the statements made by our consuls speak of the apathy and inactivity of the local officials, of their failure to take any proper steps either to safeguard the roads or to trace the thieves, of their neglect to guard localities close to towns or places where robbers were rampant, of their evasion of responsibility by endeavouring to shift it to others, or by alleging that the robbers came from another neighbouring jurisdiction, and the like. It is assumed by all our consuls that it was the plain duty of the Persian authorities to maintain the safety of the public highways [11541] Da 18 ^ for traders and travellers alike, and this, as mentioned in paragiaph 46 above, was also the view which Sir P. Loraine, our Minister, expressed in his no e o the Persian Government of the 5th November, 1923. . 50. It may, of course, be that in a number of instances the Persian Govern ment may be in a position to show that at the times these outrages occuned local uprisings or other serious disturbances rendered the Central Government ioi 11^ moment powerless to prevent them, and so to argue that in these instances the™ are absolved from responsibility. But such argument is rather for the Persian Government itself to plead before an arbitral tribunal than for us to use as a means of disposing of representations made by British subjects and firms who incurred serious losses from the incidents complained of. War Claims. 51. The next most important class of our claims against Persia relates to outrages of various kinds during the war period, and to forced evacuations of Persian towns during the internal disturbances of that period. These incidents arose largely from the activities of enemy agents among tribes over whom the Persian Government either neglected or were unable to exercise control, and to the advance of enemy troops into Persian territory. The Persian Government have consistently denied liability for any of these occurrences, on the ground that, in spite of their remonstrances, the country had been made the battleground of the belligerent Powers, with the resulting disintegration of all internal organisation. We on our part appear to have almost as consistently maintained that they failed to preserve their neutrality, and that the claims must stand. Some exception to this attitude on our part might perhaps be drawn from the terms of the note which Sir P. Cox addressed to the Persian Government on the 9th August, 1919 (State Papers, cxii, 764), where, in obtaining Persian agreement to a waiver on the respective sides, subject to a proviso, of damage done by British troops in Persia and the cost of maintenance of those troops, he spoke of “ the British troops which His Majesty’s Government were obliged to send to Persia owing to Persia’s want of power to defend her neutrality.” Some distinctions exist between the incidents complained of. The evacuations of Persian towns mainly resulted from the advance of Turkish troops upon them, or of local disturbances engineered by enemy agents; outrages at various places were the work of Persian tribesmen; in the outrages at Shiraz in 1915 the Persian gendarmerie appear to have played a considerable part; elsewhere Persian local levies were responsible for some losses; while Russian troops, in the general disorder which followed the Bolshevik upheaval in Russia, also contributed their share. 52. These war-time claims, which are individually set out in the volume Legation Claims and Consulate Claims: War-Time, and are classified in paragraphs 6 , 17 and 22 above, may, with the amounts claimed, be placed under four heads :— ( 1 ) Outrages on British consular officers and subjects : 680,931-22 krans and £38,640. (2) Losses on evacuations of Persian towns: 1,205,196-70 krans and £563 135. 9d. (3) Losses of the Imperial Bank of Persia and its staff: 5,961,500 -80 krans and £ 100 . (4) Miscellaneous: highway robberies, &amp;c. : 2,046,562 • 37 krans, £55,664 19s. hd. and 1,990 rupees. Or a total in all of 9,894,191-09 krans, £94,968 135. 2 d. and 1,990 rupees. Some of these claims, however, appear to rest on slender foundation. 53. As regards (1), outrages on British consular officers and subjects are, of course, serious matters, and afford just ground for demanding adequate compensation. We have, as shown in paragraph 10 , settled some claims under this head out of Persian funds during our occupation; and, as mentioned in paragraph 11 , we have ultimately to account to the Treasury and the Government of India for sums advanced to certain of the victims of these outrages to defray their losses, should we ultimately succeed in obtaining a settlement of these war-time claims by the Persian Government. As regards (2), the groundwork of our claims for losses sustained in the evacuation of Persian towns does not seem19 « r so simple. There appear to be two classes of cases—those due to the advance of enemy forces invading Persia and those due to local uprisings, fostered it ma\ be by enemy agents working on the minds of tribes over whom the Persian Lkrv em inent seem to have exercised but a scanty control. In the first, the argument ma\ perhaps be that when Turkish forces invaded Persia, ostensibly on the ground that there were already some Russian troops there, it was the business of the ✓-Persian Government to keep them out, and that, as they failed to do so, losses oUstained by British officials and subjects who were forced to depart in the face of this enemy invasion were losses for which the Persian Government are liable. There is obviously some contentious matter here. In the second, it seems clearei that the local populations, even if misled by enemy intriguers, were the actual offenders, even though it may be doubtful if the Persian Government had the means to control them. As regards (3), the claims of the Imperial Bank of Persia and its staff have already been referred to in paragraphs 29 and 30 above; while, as regards ( 4 ), highway robberies and other outrages were, of course, more frequent during the war period than in others, owing to the disorganised state of the country. 54. As regards our claims for war losses there seems little doubt that it these are advanced before an arbitral tribunal, the Persian Government will, on their part, advance counter-claims against us for Persian losses during this period. There are several references in the Legation correspondence to their intention to advance claims of this nature against the belligerent Powers who carried on operations in Persia; in that relating to Legation claim No. 29, £.g., they said they hoped, when the questions of the war were decided, to obtain considerable compensation for damage to Persia and its inhabitants from the operations of the belligerent Powers. It seems unlikely that they will obtain much in this way from either Russia or Turkey—and there seems no evidence that they have tried to do so—but they may hope to obtain some from us, more especially when the opportunity is afforded them of setting off their claims against ours; while their assessment of any damage they can lay at our doors is not likely to err on the side of moderation. We have already had indication of one large claim—that of one Atychides for a ship condemned by our prize court at Bombay, in which a figure of some £900,000 is mentioned—and research will doubtless provide them with further opportunities in this direction. A despatch of Sir R. Clive’s of the 4th May, 1929, said that they were engaged in drawing up a list of counter-claims for damage done during the occupation of Persia by foreign armies in the period 1914—21; and in a further despatch of the 15th June, 1929, he gave his impression that their intention was to resist any possibility’ of a cash payment to us by presenting counter-claims arising out of the occupation of Persia by British forces during the war. In this event the total of their claims would probably far exceed ours, and this consideration—coupled with doubts as to the fate before an arbitral tribunal of our own war-time claims, when the conditions to which Persia, which early in the war declared its neutrality, was exposed at the hands of the contending belligerent Powers, came under review before that tribunal—has led us recently to the proposal that the terms of any agreement, which might be ultimately reached for the settlement of claims should exclude losses of a non-contractual kind incurred between the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921, the date when the last British troops left’Persia. If this proposal should be eventually adopted it will materially reduce the total of our outstanding claims against Persia, as shown in the approximate figures given in paragraph 39 above. 56. Questions of damage done by British troops m Persia arose in 1919, when, as supplementary to the agreement of the 9th August, 1919, between His Majesty’s Government 1 and the Persian Government, notes were exchanged on the 9 th- 10 th August, 1919, between Sir P. Cox and Vossug-ed-Dowleh lor the waiver of claims on the respective sides for the cost of maintenance of those troops and any damage done by them in Persia, but leaving the claims of individuals and private institutions to be dealt with independently. The latter clause was doubtless meant to safeguard our own claims, but it leaves the door open to Persian claims also. These notes are shown on pp. 167-8 of our printed correspondence respecting the affairs of Persia, 1919^ (Confidential 11601). The' agreement mentioned and its annexes provided by their terms neither for ratifica tion nor denunciation, and must be assumed therefore to have possessed validity as from the date of their signature. The correspondence, however, shows that the [11541] D 2^0 ♦ submission of the agreement to the Persian Majlis was insiste on y Government; that they delayed such submission, while opposi pnlpn f agreement in the meantime sprung up and grew in force; and tha ie g was denounced a few years later. But in these circumstances i wou that the Persian Government have already committed themselves by the notes exchanged on the 9th-10th August, 1919, to a recognition that ( l ue ® l°^ s • damage caused by British troops in Persia are set off against the cos tenance of those troops, subject, however, to such claims as might e pre by individuals and private institutions, which, of course, might be, an pro a y would be, for very large amounts. IV. Attitude of the Persian Government. 57. Reference was made in paragraph 3 to customs of the past in invoking compensation for losses sustained by British subjects in Persia by means of re P re ' sentations made direct to the local Administrations of the districts into which the country was divided, and to the subsequent notification of such claims to the Persian Government only after all prospects of redress in this way had been exhausted. It is apparent from the Tehran annual reports of former years that the Persian Government paid but slight attention to these notifications, with the result that most of these older claims still exist in our records. On the other hand, the system then followed, both in regard to the Legation and consulate claims, led to a somewhat loose procedure in the way of collating formal and precise evidence of the losses incurred. The loss or destruction during the war-tinie disturbances of much of such documentary evidence as did exist in the Legation or consulate archives is a further handicap in the way of our advancement of these older claims. The Persian Government may doubtless be expected to be fully alive to the disadvantage in which we are placed in this respect. 58. But apart from this there are many indications in the correspondence of the past of their disinclination to meet claims advanced against them, where any possible objection to doing so could be raised. Thus in regard to Burglaries they contested claims because of delay in advancing them; because they saw no ground for compensation, even where the robbery was from a British consulate supposed to be guarded by police; because they found no precedent for compensation for such robberies. Highway robberies because no Government could be responsible for stolen goods, but only for efforts to recover them; because having taken steps to trace the robbers they could not be further responsible; because of delay in advancing the claim; because of the existence of a rebellion at the time or of war-time disturbances; because the robbers came from beyond Persian frontiers. Insurrections because of uncertainty whether the damage was done by Government troops or insurgents; because of the owner’s carelessness in taking the animals into the fighting sphere; because of the dual nationality of the claimant, British and Persian. Murder and other outrages because the British consular officials were Persians; because the claimants were Persians; because, though British, they were also Persians. Question of Contract because there was only a written promise and not a contract; because, though contractual, it required submission to the Majlis. Revolution (1909) because the looting by troops of the late Shah constituted a case of force majeure. Riots because the Imperial Russian Government paid no compensation for similar losses in Russia; because the ringleader was Russian and so the claim properly one against the Russian Government; because of lapse of time; because the claimant had not availed himself of legal remedies. Steamship Shushan, attacks on, because these were made by Turks from across the border. War-time outrages because compensation should be sought from the real instigators of the disturbances, viz., the enemy Governments; because the Persian Government was not responsible for losses and injuries consequent21 ♦ by the Persian isition to the the agreement would appear 3 by the notes t questions of ! cost of main^ it be preferred i, and probably ast in invoking neans of repre- icts into which h claims to the way had been •mer years that itions, with the the other hand, late claims, led )recise evidence tie disturbances on or consulate of these older e fully alive to correspondence ist them, where d to— ivancing them; he robbery was because they responsible for ing taken steps ecause of delay i at the time or leyond Persian ge was done by carelessness in lual nationality ir officials were though British, )romise and not n to the Majlis, the late Shah io compensation ssian and so the use of lapse of remedies. : by Turks from it from the real ts; because the tries consequent on the violation of her neutrality by the belligerent Powers; because of the dislocation of internal organisation owing to the operations of the belhgeient Powers, notwithstanding Persian protests, &amp;c. 59. The above having been their attitude in the past, it is hardly to be expected that in present circumstances the Persian Government will be f° un less difficult to deal with; while, so far as regards war-time claims, they are \ probably in a position to advance claims of considerable magnitude against us on behalf of individuals and private institutions, who are not likely to estimate any losses at a low figure. But as regards claims for damage done by British troops in Persia, the agreement of the 9th-10th August, 1919, referred to in paragraph 51, which appears to have had temporary validity, seems to absolve us from claims over and above such as may be made by individuals and private institutions, which by that agreement were to be dealt with independently. 60. In paragraph 48 Sir C. Hurst’s suggestion of 1923 that a preliminary examination of claims should take place between representatives of the Peisian Government and our Legation was mentioned. Efforts in this direction appear to have been deferred at Tehran for some years thereafter pending the P 08 ^ 1 e settlement of other questions and the classification of our claims. Meanwhi e, Sir R. Clive in 1928 laid before the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee his geneial views as to the possibility of securing a settlement of our various private and commercial claims outstanding. Most of these claims, he said, were war debts which the Persian Government would never admit, and many of the claimants had doubtless written them off; in his opinion, the best means of settlement would be to induce the Persian Government to pay a lump sum of £250,000 in tmai settlement. This proposal was advocated in the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee s report, which was approved by the Cabinet. Accordingly, on the 7th November, 1928 general instructions were sent to Sir R. Clive in which he was authorised to reduce the amount to be paid by the Persian Government for these private and commercial claims to a round figure of from £300,000 down to £ 2 o 0 , 000 , representing, it was said, about one-fifth of the total amounts claimed. _ 61 Sir R. Clive, however, saw difficulties. The Persian Government might, he considered, ( 1 ) either refuse to recognise the claims altogether, or ( 2 ) might reject the reduced figures unless allowed to go through the claims themselves. As regards (1), he suggested we should either insist on an actual payment or, alternatively, on payment of £300,000 of the debt owing by the Persian Govern ment to His Majesty’s Government, settling in the latter event the claims ourselves in London out of this amount, and levying a percentage for the cost ot distribution; while, as regards ( 2 ), he imagined that in this event we should have to submit the actual claims to the Persian Government. These suggestions, however did not meet with approval here, and in a further instruction to Sir R. Clive of the 27th February, 1929, it was pointed out that the 1 ersian Railway Syndicate’s claim in itself amounted to nearly £250,000 and that the cutting down of this and other claims sponsored in the past by His Majesty s Government would doubtless arouse much opposition; it was preferable therefore to divide the claims into two categories, the first consisting of the i er81{ * n Railway Syndicate’s claims and others of special importance, to be settled by separate negotiation with the Persian Government; the second consisting of minor claims, war claims and brigandage claims, where less objection existed to pressing for a lump sum in final settlement, by discussing certain representative claims 'with a view of reaching an agreement on the basis of a final payment ot some proportion of their face value; or else, alternatively, a formal claims agreement, on the analogy of one concluded with the Mexican Government, might be negotiated, providing that all outstanding claims should be submitted to a Mixed Claims Commission with a neutral president, or to a single neutral arbitrator to be chosen by agreement. + 62 Shortly afterwards, as recorded m the lehran annual report foi 1J29 (p 21), the Persian Minister of Court, in March of that year, suggested a commission of enquiry, with representatives on both sides, to prepare a report which mio-ht serve as a basis for subsequent negotiations. A rough analysis of our claims having been made at our Legation, a preliminary meeting was held at the end of April between representatives of the Legation and the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The latter were, however, of opinion that each claim would have to be treated on its merits, and that no general principle could22 # be laid down to serve as basis for a settlement, while they added that the Peisian Government would put in claims on the other side, and that these were being prepared. It thus became evident that a protracted examination of the C J^ 1 I J 1S on both sides would be necessary before even a basis for agreement could be arrived at, and it was suggested that an article should be included in the general treaty contemplated to deal with the special subject of claims. The Persian Minister of Court appears, indeed, to have suggested that His Majesty s Govern-^ ment should make themselves responsible for settling the claims of British subjects as part of the financial arrangements of a general settlement, or else that the claims should be excluded from the negotiations for the treaty, and be submitted in due course to the Persian Government for verification before any actual scheme for liquidation was decided on. The annual report adds that in face of this intransigent attitude His Majesty’s Government considered it advisable to press for arbitration on all the claims, a course which would entail securing in the general treaty an article and detailed protocol providing for the establishment of a Claims Commission with a neutral president. 63. This appears to bring the matter down to the present time, and to the recent correspondence with our Legation at Tehran as to the form which this article and protocol dealing with claims should assume. Our recent proposal is that it should be drawn to exclude on both sides claims, other than contractual, arising out of acts done or events which took place between the 4th August, 1914. and the 22nd February, 1921. If this proposal is accepted by the Persian Govern ment, and our Legation think there is some ground for this belief, it will relieve us from the prospect of meeting what might prove to be very extensive claims on the part of Persian subjects or institutions for losses during the war period occasioned by our operations in Persia. On the other hand—leaving out of account claims which appear in large numbers in the consulate lists, but are backed by no evidence whatever—it will reduce the totality of our claims, apart from interest, to about 5,155,075 krans, £266,841 125. bd., 181,699-IS-9 rupees, and 6,962-40 dollars; while unless the evidence available to us in support of these peace-time and contractual claims can yet be amplified by the various claimants, there can be little doubt that the total amount resulting from such awards as are pronounced by an arbitral tribunal in respect of them, and in the face of Persian counter-argument, will fall far short of the figures mentioned. V. Conclusions. 64. The investigation made of the five groups of claims originally set out in paragraph 2 can now be summarised :— (A) The Legation Claims are classified in paragraph 6 , and are commented on in paragraph 8 , while in the volume Legation Claims they are set out in detail, with the evidence furnished (consisting in the main of correspondence) and the amounts claimed in each case, which reach a total of 5,447,415-20 krans, £345,413 35 . §d., 70,417 rupees, and 6,962-40 dollars, neglecting a few which must be dismissed on the facts shown. The claims comprise— Highway robberies and outrages. War-time outrages on British consuls and subjects. War-time evacuations of Persian towns. Persian Railway Syndicate (cost of surveys). Persian Transport Company (cancellation of concession). Quarantine Medical Officers in Persian Gulf (salaries). And eight other miscellaneous claims, some of which rest on uncertain foundations. Precise and detailed documentary evidence is wanting in most instances; it will, therefore, be for the respective claimants to supply this need, where required, if their claims go before an arbitral tribunal, though in the case of companies or firms we are entitled to assume that the necessary documents are in their possession. Certain war-time claims were settled bv us out of Persian funds, and some others for highway robbery were settled by the Persian authorities!23 while sums advanced by the Treasury and the Government of India fall to be repaid to the latter if claims for war-time outrages should be eventually met by the Persian Government. (B) The Consulate Claims extend over a wide field and a period of some 40 years. They are returned by the consuls in three categories (a), (b) and (c), but many are unclassified. The (a) claims are returned as being valid, both in ^substance and evidence; the (b) claims as valid in substance but deficient in ^widence; the (c) claims and those unclassified, amounting to 352 out of the total of 626, have now no sufficient evidence or none at all available to support them. The (a) claims number 202; the (b) claims number 72; while the facts of each of these 274 cases, and details of the evidence furnished in support of them, are set out in the volumes Consulate Claims: Peace-Time and Consulate Claims: t | ‘ War-Time, a few selected (c) claims being also included in this compilation. The total of the amounts claimed in categories (a) and (b), i.e., in claims held by the consuls to lie clearly against the Persian Government, is 3,585,350-65 krans, £16,297 Is. 10d., and 168,272-5-9 rupees, apart from certain additions of interest claimed. But, as remarked in paragraphs 19-20, it is sometimes doubtful whether the offence for which a claim is made would justify a claim against the Persian Government; while there are manifest differences of view among the respective consuls as to what may constitute an (a), (b) or (c) claim; and also a wide range in the amount of evidence furnished, from a complete dossier to little of practical value. (C) The Denials of Justice Claims were commented on in paragraph 28, and amount to a total of 455,565 krans, £6,913, 11.259 rupees and 20,000 roubles. They lack any documentary evidence whatever to support them, since none can be traced at Tehran, and they must seemingly be dismissed from our reckoning, a view which Sir R. Hoare upholds. (D) The Imperial Bank of Persia Claims for the looting of their branches in Persia during the war are commented on in paragraph 29, and amount to 5,952.027-80 krans, with interest. The head office of the bank in London are apparently prepared to furnish any detailed evidence that may be required of these losses; and they are also said to be engaged in a research to see how many of their older claims of the past were met by insurance companies, who, they presume, have never advanced claims for such payments. ' \ 1 (E) The Staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia Claims for their private losses, mainly during the war, are similarly referred to in paragraph 30. They relate to sixteen claimants, of whom ten are said to be Persians. Of the six British ? * subjects, only one has furnished detailed evidence of his losses, while the remaining five, who between them claim 19,894-20 krans and £100, have not yet furnished any. The bank, however, are understood to be preparing a statement as to how many of their losses were met by insurance companies. (F) The investigation made shows that to the above groups of claims there must be added another—that of Insurance Companies or Underwriters. These are referred to in paragraphs 42-44, but it is evident that besides those mentioned there there must be a good many others who were concerned in pay ments made for goods pillaged or losses incurred in Persia, and that if the opportunity presented itself of any settlement of claims, a number might still be advanced. 65. War-Time CZams.—These are commented on in paragraphs 51-56. If, as Sir R. Hoare is inclined to think, the Persian Government would agree to the exclusion of war-time claims from the scope of the proposed agreement, this will relieve us from the prospect of having to face what, it is easy to imagine, might be extensive claims for alleged damage done to Persian subjects or institutions during the war period, which might far exceed any total amount we are in a position to claim. If they accept the draft agreement in the form we propose, it would also relieve us from the Atychides claim, which in itself appears to exceed A - the whole of our claims. But if the Persian Government, while agreeing in general that war-time claims should be excluded, nevertheless persist in retaining certain classes of them, such as that of Atychides, the matter would then seem to become one for further, perhaps protracted, negotiations, in which we have the appearance of having in hand a large body of claims for outrages done to British officials, subjects and institutions in Persia during the war (even if some doubt may be entertained whether, in the conditions then existing in Persia, we could successfully prosecute these before an arbitral tribunal). The24 * omission of these war-time claims from the scope of the agreement would, however, reduce the totality of our claims from the provisional estimate, in paragraph 39, of 15,228,725 krans, £361,810, 240,305 rupees and 6,962 -40 dollars to some 5,155,075 krans, £266,841, 181,700 rupees and 6,962-40 dollars, apart from additions of interest, from any further claims which may yet come to light, and from any underwriters’ claims which may yet be made. It would also thiow us back largely upon pre-war claims, where the evidence furnished is the most] defective 66 . The proposal to eliminate these war-time claims arising between the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921, will doubtless provoke repre sentations from parties who suffered losses during that period, but our case against the Persian Government to repair these war-time losses does not seem to rest upon any very strong ground, for most, if not all, of them may be attributed, either directly or indirectly, to enemy action in Persia ; while we seem to have admitted (to some extent at any rate), in the note which Sir P. Cox addressed to the Persian Government on the 9th August, 1919, that Persia was powerless to defend her neutrality. Towards the evacuations of Persian towns by British firms and communities who had remained in Persia during the disturbances and disorders which then prevailed, the correspondence here shows that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India went to considerable expense on their behalf to convey them elsewhere; and often, in the case of our own officials, who had no option but to remain, to compensate them for the loss or suffering involved in outrages to which they were subjected. Incidentally, we drew upon Persian funds to repair some of these war-time losses; while a waiver of them will involve a non-settlement of such amounts as His Majesty’s Government and the Govern ment of India contributed. It seems possible, however, that there may remain one or two cases in which our officials sustained losses of property for which they might represent they had not been fully compensated. 67. Peace-Time and Contractual Claims —If war-time claims were thus excluded, these will remain.( 3 ) The following occupy the foremost places :— Persian Railway Syndicate: £202,207, with 7 per cent, compound interest. The figure is that given in 1924. In 1933 they offered to take £134,653 odd; their latest estimate in 1934 makes the figure £373,331 odd. Persian Transport Company: £50,000; but earlier £75,900. Quarantine medical officers in Persian Gulf : 69,967 • 10 rupees and 16,814-60 krans. We seem to be in need of a detailed account of these figures from the Government of India. Sir Wolseley Haig : £4,807. In 1921 he informed our Legation he would be satisfied with £2,500. Mr. T. Casey: £1,200. (Our Legation comment in 1909 on this was- “It seems enormous.”) The above total £258,214, 16,814-60 krans and 69,967-10 rupees, leaving for the remaining claims under this head some £8,627, 5,138.260 krans, 111,732 rupees and 6,962-40 dollars, which is distributed over a great number of individual claims for highway robberies, outrages of various kinds, losses in civil disturbances, tribal raids, piracies, burglaries, &amp;c. Among these is the large and very doubtful one for 2,302,905 krans preferred by Messrs. Lynch or the Persian Transport Company for the cost of running the steamship Shushan from 1902 to 1913, which seems to have little to rest on. If this claim were omitted as likely of rejection, we have a total when all is included, for peace-time and contractual claims, of some £266,841, 2,852,170 krans, 181,699 rupees and 6,962 -40 dollars, which, however, in itself includes a sum of about 468,000 krans claimed as interest by a Mr. Haycock on an original debt of some 100,000 krans owing to him by the Persian authorities. Reduced to a sterling equivalent at rates of 50 krans, 15 rupees and 5 dollars to the £, the whole body of these peace-time and contractual claims might be assumed to amount to at most some £340,000, apart from further additions of interest claimed in some cases, which there can be no certainty would be awarded by an arbitral tribunal in the absence of any treaty provision on the subject of interest. ( 3 ) A short summary of these is given on pp. vii to xxii of the volume Legation Claims immediately after the index. [This summary is printed below as Appendix 3.]68 . Evidence .—The question of sufficiency of evidence was discussed in paragraphs 31-36, where it was seen that the documentary evidence furnished by our Legation and consulates in regard to the various claims falls as a rule far short of that prescribed by Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions as proper where claims are to be preferred by His Majesty’s Government against another Government. The conditions prevailing in Persia at the times when most of the '^claims were originally advanced seem, in fact, to have been such as not to demand the preparation of documentary evidence with all the fullness and precision of present-day requirements; while much of such documentary evidence as did exist in our Legation and consular archives has since been lost or destroyed during the war-time disturbances—in the case of Kermanshah this lack of documentary evidence, indeed, extends to the entire body of claims recorded there. On the other hand, the documentary evidence wherewith to establish claims of more recent date must often be assumed to be in the possession of the claimants themselves, and this would apply in particular to the first four of the important claims specified at the beginning of paragraph 67 above. 69. The main difficulty, indeed, as regards the peace-time claims resides in the great host of miscellaneous claims, also referred to in paragraph 67 above, which rest upon documentary evidence, occasionally complete, but usually incomplete, not to mention others in which it is wholly absent. A number of these earlier claims are for old-world events, in which it seems doubtful whether either the original claimant or the alleged offender is still alive, or whether after this lapse of time he has any further interest in the claim he preferred many years ago. On the other hand, a much larger number are by British firms formerly trading in Persia, who, in consequence of declining business, seem to be going one by one into liquidation, and who may be expected to be more active in the pursuit of their claims. It seems evident, however, that in the circumstances which have occurred opportunity must be afforded to these various claimants to furnish any additional evidence which may yet be available to them in support of their respective claims—either to supplement what we have, or to replace what has been lost, so as to provide a suitable documentary basis for as many as possible. It appears to be a usual practice, previous to the institution of arbitral proceedings of the kind, to publish a notification in the London Gazette for general information, and to give opportunity for the production of evidence in support of claims; and there seems the greater need for this in a case like the present, where the evidence we have, though often showing a just grievance, is as a rule defective according to international standards. In this connexion Sir R. Hoare’s remark in paragraph 7 of his despatch of the 18th February, 1933.( 4 ) that it will be comparatively simple to obtain from claimants affidavits or declara tions where necessary, should be borne in mind (most of Messrs. Lynch’s or the Persian Transport Company’s robbery claims are unsupported in this way); while, as regards consulate claims, more especially in the case of Shiraz, much of the evidence furnished is not certified by the consul, as it should have been and will have to be. 70. From the foregoing it would appear, therefore, that if the proposal to exclude war-time claims from the arbitration is eventually agreed to, we shall be left with these peace-time and contractual claims, the most important of which, specified in paragraph 67 above, reach a total which might be roughly estimated in sterling at about £263.000, apart from interest; leaving for the more numerous miscellaneous claims, also mentioned there, a total which might be similarly estimated at about £72,000, apart from interest; or a combined total of about £335,000, apart from interest. But as regards these numerous miscellaneous claims, until we are furnished with all such further evidence as the claimants may yet be able to adduce, we shall not be in a position to make the final apportionment of their claims between such as can be regarded as adequately supported, and such as are not, for the purpose of submitting to an arbitral tribunal. Meanwhile, the individual claims are set out in the volumes Legation Claims and Consulate Claims, showing the facts of each and the evidence we at present have. When this is supplemented by all such further evidence as we may hope to obtain (more especially perhaps from British firms) from the customary notification in the London Gazette and any other steps deemed desirable once the treaty position has been regularised, it should not be difficult to append this further evidence to what we have, and then to determine from the legal stand- (*) See also Sir P.

RITCHIE. December 31, 1934. Appendix 1. Sir R. Hoare to Sir John Simon. (No. 69.) gi r Tehran, February 18, 1933. AS arranged in private correspondence with your Department (see my lettei of the 31st December, 1932, to Mr. Rendel), I have the honour to transmit herewith lists of the various British claims outstanding against the Persian Government. It will be remembered that in 1923 a previous^ list of claims was transmitted to your Department under cover of Sir P. Loraine’s despatch No. 308 of the 11 th July of that year. 2. The claims dossiers themselves will be packed in a box, which will be taken to Bagdad by the ordinary fortnightly courier. His Majesty’s Embassy have been requested to arrange onward transmission across the desert to Beirut and thence to London. The box will be addressed to the Librarian, the Foreign Office. 3. A copy of this despatch accompanies the claims, and to each bundle or section is attached a copy of the covering list. 4 . Some explanation is perhaps needed of the method that has been adopted in arranging the claims now transmitted. The claims are in two main classes, (a) “ consulate ” claims, {b) k ‘ Tehran ” claims. 5 . As regards the former, it will suffice if I draw attention to the circular( 5 ) addressed to all His Majesty’s consular officers in Persia in 1924. This circular explains the method followed at almost all consular posts, the only exceptions being noted and explained in Annex II to this despatch. 6 . The claims on the “ Tehran ” list were, however, not dealt with in the same manner. The “ consulate ” claims are in almost every case provided with the necessary affidavits and declarations, but, owing to pressure of work and the large number of claims involved, it proved impossible to follow the same method in regard to the Tehran claims. In 1925-26, however, Mr. J. P. G. Finch, at that time probationer vice-consul at the Legation, went through the archives of the Legation and laboriously collected from the enormous number of dossiers under review (many of them unindexed volumes containing masses of unrelated papers) all possible documents bearing on the claims. These documents he arranged in separate dossiers, one for each claim. These dossiers have now been examined by Mr. Busk and Mr. Gamble; all unnecessary papers have been removed from them, and in many cases additional papers have been added from later archives. Moreover, various new claims have been added to the 1924 list, originally compiled by Mr. Humphreys. The labour thus involved was consider able, but the task of arranging the Tehran claims in dossiers would have been quite impracticable with the available staff had it not been for the invaluable work performed by Mr. Finch, whose labours in this connexion are deserving of the highest praise. Mr. Busk and Mr. Gamble have, in addition, prepared the covering lists to the “consulate ’’ claims, Shiraz having been the only post to supply one, and checked the dossiers, and I am greatly indebted to them for the time and trouble they have taken. 7. It is thus clear that, while the “consulate ’’ claims are in most cases fully supported by affidavits, the “ Tehran ’’ claims are not. Each “ Tehran ” ( 4 ) No. 30 of July 29, 1924 : a copy formed Annex 1 to the despatch ; not printed.claim dossier contains, however, the fullest available details of the exact circum stances and amount of the claim, together with copies of notes to the Persian Government and other important documents where it has proved possible to trace any. These details should suffice to place any expert appointed to examine the claims in possession of all the relevant facts, and it will be comparatively simple to obtain from the claimants affidavits or declarations if these are thought necessary. A 8. It is thus clear that no attempt has been made to divide the claims into categories as was done in the enclosure to my predecessor’s despatch No. 196 of the 19th April, 1929. 9. I have the honour to submit, as an annex* to this despatch, some notes on the various “consulate” claims which may prove of value in any subsequent examination. All notes on the “ Tehran ” claims are contained in a special “ remarks ” column in the list. 10. In addition to claims by British subjects against the Persian Govern ment noted in the “ Tehran ” and 11 consulate ” lists, there is a third category of claims of a rather different type. These have been classed in the past as “ denials of justice,” and are cases where British subjects have sued Persian subjects in the courts and have either failed to obtain justice or have obtained a favourable verdict, but have been unable to persuade the local authorities to enforce that verdict. 11. These claims are all very old, none of them dating from later than 1912, and as far as is known no statements regarding them have ever been transmitted to the Foreign Office. They were, however, presented to the Persian Government on at least two occasions before the war, and the original draft of the note covering the second presentation is annexed to the list. There is no trace of the previous note. 12. The only record of these claims in the Legation archives consists of lists giving meagre details of each case, unsupported by any affidavits; these lists* are transmitted in original (Annex III to this despatch), a brief summary of the list having been made for retention in the Legation archives in case of need. 13. It will, in my opinion, be entirely impossible to hold the Persian Government to any responsibility for these claims. 14. The final main category of claims are those by the Imperial Bank of Persia against the Persian Government on account of damage suffered during the war when bank premises were looted. A statement of these claims prepared by the general manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Tehran is attached to this despatch (Annex IV). The accounts of events leading up to the evacuation of each branch were prepared in His Majesty’s Legation at the request of the bank in 1927. It has unfortunately proved impossible at the moment to trace the representations (referred to in Mr. Wilkinson’s letter) which were made to the Persian Government in 1921. A search for the missing papers is, however, being prosecuted, and it is anticipated that they may yet be traced. It will be remembered that these claims were the subject of private discussion between the bank and the Persian Government in 1929 (see Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 250 of the 4th May, 1929). 15. In addition to their official claims, the Imperial Bank of Persia submitted to this Legation a list of the ‘ ‘ private ’ ’ claims of various members of the staff. These claims were compared with the lists prepared by the Legation and consulates, and it was found that several of the claims already figured therein. Sixteen, however, were not previously recorded, and these have been added to the Tehran list as Nos. 98 to 113 inclusive. No detailed documents are available in support of these claims, but it might in some cases be possible to obtain them if it were thought necessary. It will be noted that claims Nos. 104 to 113 inclusive are by Persian subjects, and it will presumably not therefore be possible for His Majesty’s Government to support them. It was, however, thought better to add them to the list for purposes of record, especially in view of the fact that they are likely to figure in the future in correspondence between His Majesty’s Legation and the Imperial Bank of Persia and between your Department and the London office. 16. In submitting these “ private ” claims to the Legation, the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia pointed out that he was unaware how many of them had been met by insurance companies or underwriters. The London office of the bank have, however, been requested to prepare a statement on this subject and to * Not printed.30 transmit it direct to the Foreign Office. It is, moreover, posM ) e ‘ researches made by the London office may bring to light a mim e “ official ” claims of the Imperial Bank of Persia which were ‘ , i . companies and which do not, therefore, figure in the list (Amiex ) a ' \ n j this despatch. The local manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia as 110 of the number or magnitude of these claims, which are lor cas 00 , . roads, &amp;c. The insurance companies have presumably never put 111 am c f ^ against the Persian Government as they are entitled to do. 17. This question of payments by insurance companies is ot impoi regard to all the claims, and I regret that I have no information as to w e er any, and, if so, how many, claims were met in this way. I conclude tna in sue cases the claim against the Persian Government should be regarded as avmg been transferred from the original claimant to the insurance companies. 18. One claim which is in a category by itself is not noted on any list. is is the claim of the heirs of the late Mooshi Daniel, all information regarding which is available in the archives of the Foreign Office (see Foieign Ulnce despatch No. 344 of the 14th June, 1932). 19. It is worthy of note, since many of the claims are expressed m krans, that the kran has depreciated considerably during the last twenty years, and that, unless claimants are paid in the sterling-kran rate prevailing at the time, considerable losses will result. A rough statement* of the totals of all the claims has, however, been prepared and is attached to this despatch (Annex V)^ It cannot be taken as definite (a) because of the exchange difficulty mentioned above, (b) because the amounts of some claims are not given, (c) because there is no uniformity as regards the computation of interest; in most cases interest has not been added, but in a few (notably the Persian Railway Syndicate s claim) it forms a large part of the total sum claimed. The approximate grand total at the present rate of exchange is between £650,000 and £700,000. 20. One final point should be emphasised. As far as is known, all the claims now transmitted for consideration are by British subjects, except when the contrary is clearly noted, but it is quite possible that some of the claimants are non-British subjects, and, indeed, several claimants who have for years figured on the Legation’s lists and whose claims have been presented to the Persian Government have, during the recent examination of all the claims, been discovered to be non-British subjects. I regret that I am not in a position to throw any further light on this point, the attitude adopted in the past having apparently been that anyone serving in a British institution, such as the Imperial Bank of Persia or the Indo-European Telegraph Department, or in one of His Majesty’s consulates, was entitled to support in presenting his claims against the Persian Government. In the case of Legation or consulate employees, there is no doubt much justice in this point of view. A case in point is that of the Persian employees captured with Major O’Connor at Shiraz in 1915. But I cannot but feel that His Majesty’s Government has no real locus standi in respect of what I have referred to in paragraph 15 as the ‘ ‘ private ’ ’ claims of members of the Imperial Bank of Persia staff, where the claimants are non-British subjects and where the losses were not suffered for any reason connected with their British employment. 21. None of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s official claims have been included, owing to the entry into force of the Telegraphs Agreement signed on the 13th January, 1932. 22. I have sent a copy of this despatch (without enclosures) to Mr. Finch, care of the Foreign Office (No. 11 M), and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. P.S.—-A final examination of the lists leads to the suspicion that Bushire claims Nos. 76 and 77 may well be identical with Shiraz claims 33 (category B) and 8 (category A) respectively, though the amounts differ.

In the present volume as full and detailed an account as is possible is given of the claims shown in the Legation schedule (Nos. 1 to 114), both peace-time and war-time, setting out such information as can be gathered from the correspondence and documents available concerning these claims lodged at Tehran itself. In view of the recent proposal (which Sir R. Hoare considers the Persian Government will accept) to exclude from the contemplated arbitration non contractual claims on both sides falling within the period from the 4th August, 1914, to the 22nd February, 1921, it may be convenient to summarise briefly the main facts of those which in this event would remain in the Legation group of claims, viz., those occurring in times of peace. There is one exceptional case (Claim No. 79) within the war period which seems to present features of a semi-contractual kind. It will be seen that, apart from correspondence, we have at present very little actual documentary evidence in support of these claims. But in some* instances the evidence is known to be in the claimant’s possession; in others it may be assumed to be in their possession; while in others we have Sir R. Hoare’s assurance that it will be comparatively simple to obtain from the claimants affidavits if these are thought necessary. Claim No. 1.—Mr. J. P. Richards claimed 6,962-40 dollars, plus interest, for the loss of 117 bales of wool destroyed in riots at Meshed on the 22nd March, 1905. There seems no evidence that the Persian Government granted compensation for losses occasioned by these riots, and there is evidence that at the time they refused claims preferred by Russia on the ground that Russia had rejected similar Persian claims for losses in riots in Southern Russia. There is a long correspondence, and it was reported in 1927 that the Persian Government at that time refused compensation to Richards on the ground that he had not availed himself of his legal remedies. On the other hand, the annual report for that year says that they made him a tentative offer of £300 in settlement, which he refused, maintaining that his original claim was for £1,500, apart from interest. The evidence furnished consists of copies of certificates relating to the wool and its destruction. The originals are presumably in Mr. Richards’s possession.Claim No. 2.—Mr. T. Casey claimed £1,200 for the plunder of his house at Tehran during the conflict on'the 14th-l7th July, 1909, between the Shah's troops and the Nationalist troops, which ended in the deposition of the Shah. The Persian Government denied liability for the damage done by the late Shah’s troops on the ground of force majeure. We rejected this plea on the ground that it was not open to them to plead force majeure in connexion with the incidents ^ut of which the claim arose and to repudiate the responsibility incurred by their predecessors. No headway, however, has yet resulted, and the claim is supported by a statutory declaration made at the time by Mr. Casey as to the value of his goods looted or destroyed. Claim No. 3.—Mrs. Nanagan Rizzo made a claim for similar losses on the same occasion, amounting to 1,000 krans, which was also at the time preferred by our Legation against the Persian Government, but we have no statutory declaration from her in support of it, and no information concerning the lady herself. Claim No. 5.—Messrs. Lynch claimed 2,302,905-07 krans for expenses incurred in running the steamship Shushan on the Karun River from 1902 to 1913. Not having been able to get a concession for working their steamer on this part of the river, and as they wished to keep the traffic in their own hands, they made a present of the vessel to the Shah, and offered to work it, on the under standing, they say, that the profits, if any, would be paid to the Shah, while their out-of-pocket expenses would be made good to them. A rescript of the Shah of the 4th February, 1890, runs thus: “His Imperial Majesty accepts from the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company the steamship Shushan for trans porting passengers and goods between Ahwaz, Shuster and Dizful. His Imperial Majesty gives assurances to the above-mentioned company that the steamship in question will constantly run in conjunction with the company’s ships running on the Karun from Mohammerah to the Ahwaz Dam unless prevented from doing so by accidents.” This appears to be the main basis on which the claim rests, and it will be for Messrs. Lynch to furnish any other evidence of which they may be in possession in support of their contention that the understanding involved payment to them of their out-of-pocket expenses. The vessel was seemingly throughout the whole period run at a loss, and the claim mounted annually, until in 1913 it reached the total mentioned above. The Persian Government have throughout emphatically denied that they were in any way liable for any accounts connected with the running of the vessel, which, they said, had under strong pressure been accepted as a gift by the Shah. Our own view, expressed in minutes in 1919, was that the claim was rather absurd. From a recent letter from the Persian Transport Company it would seem that the latter now regard the vessel as their own, as they said it had broken its back, and that the remains of it when sold would add something to the assets of the company. Claim No. 6.—Messrs. Lynch claimed 10,663 krans for attacks made in Persian territory on the steamship Shushan (mentioned above) by Arabs, who were Turkish subjects. As this vessel appears from the above to have been in 1902 and 1904 (the time when the attacks were made) to have been the property of the Shah, and as the Turkish Government at the time denied responsibility, it does not seem clear that a liability rests on the Persian Government to meet this claim, which was presumably for repairs to the vessel, though it included also some goods. Anyhow, it will be for Messrs. Lynch to provide the requisite evidence to support it, as no documentary evidence is furnished, and the claim at present rests on statements only. Claim No. 7.—Messrs. Lynch clhimed 7,199 -30 krans for the robbery of their caravans at Dehdiz on the 9th July, 1906, by Kuhgelu tribesmen. Notification was duly made to the Bakhtiari khans by His Majesty’s consul-general at Isfahan, but pursuit of the robbers was delayed owing to those khans referring to the Persian Government for instructions, which were given that steps should be taken to arrest the robbers and recover the property. Nothing, however, resulted. It appears to have been the practice of Messrs. Lynch simply to notify our Legation of these robberies by letter only, and it will accordingly be necessary for that firm in this, as in other cases, to substantiate their claim by the production from their records of such documentary evidence as is necessary of the losses incurred. Claims Nos. 8 and 9.—These were claims by Messrs. Lynch for the destruction of their toll-house at Kasr-i-Dokhtar, between 1906 and 1908, and [11541 ; f 2the loss of tolls thus occasioned. For the destruction of the o - ouse 7,827 -35 krans was claimed, according to a detailed account, and tor the 0 tolls between 1908 and 1910 a further 60,924 krans. Messrs. Lynch were en i e under their road concessions to set up toll-houses and collect tolls, and eir endeavour to do so at Kasr-i-Dokhtar met with the full support of the rei sian Government, who were, however, powerless to enforce their repeated injunctions to the local authority, in the face of a determined local opposition, with the result^ that the building was wrecked by a mob, and the collection of tolls for the tim^ being brought to an end. Here, again, we are furnished only with statements and no depositions, and if the claims are to be pursued it will seemingly be necessary for Messrs. Lynch to supply all requisite evidence in support. I here is also reason to think that they waived their claim on this head at the time their concession was renewed in 1914 or thereabouts. t Claim No. 10.—Messrs. Lynch claimed £15 15s. for damage to a c level used by their road engineers, which was injured in a fracas in January 1907 between Cossacks in the employment of the Persian Government and the staff of their toll-house at Menzerieh. The Cossacks were severely punished by their commanding officer for their misconduct, but no compensation seems to have been obtained for the damage done to the “ level,” and it is not altogether clear whether the claim of £15 15s. was actually presented to the Persian Government. At any rate, Messrs. Lynch will have to furnish documentary evidence to justify the claim. There is none here. Claim No. 11.—The Persian Transport Company claimed some 300 krans for a post-wagon robbery in April 1909. Due representations were made by our Legation to the Persian Government, but no documentary evidence is available concerning the loss, and this remains to be furnished by the Persian Transport Company. Claim No. 12.—The Persian Transport Company claimed 180 krans for the forcible closing of their tea-house at Keraz Bridge in December 1910 by one Hasan Khan, a local dignitary, who appears to have acted in a violent and illegal manner in doing so. Representations were made by our Legation to the Persian Government, but the amount claimed is apparently still outstanding, and there is nothing in the way of precise documentary evidence to support it. Probably the Persian Transport Company, if they still maintain the claim, can from their records provide evidence. Claims Nos. 13, 21 and 22.—Messrs. Lynch in 1910 furnished our Legation with a list of goods robbed from caravans by one Naib Hussein, who in October of that year had with his followers broken out in revolt against the Persian Government and had captured and occupied the town of Kashan. Our Legation were at the time doubtful whether a claim would be justified in the circum stances; other Legations at Tehran were not entering claims; and they referred the matter home, observing, however, that in any case the line between insurgents and robbers in Persia was so fine that it might form an inconvenient precedent to put no claim in the present case. In reply we instructed the Legation that, having regard to the special circumstances, the proposal to present a claim for the sworn value of the goods was approved. This was minuted by our Legation to the effect that the sworn value of the goods should be ascertained, and that a claim would then be preferred against the Persian Government. As a result it now appears from the schedule of claims sent home that (after some twenty-four years) the claim has not yet been formulated by Messrs. Lynch, but may be submitted by the insurance company. Except in the case of two minor items (which form Claims Nos. 21 and 22), we have therefore no further information concerning these claims. These two items are as follows :— Claim No. 21.—Merely an extract from the Legation register, which shows that Messrs. Lynch compromised with one Mashallah Khan, who had asked that his goods should be insured against loss (which was not, however, done) by paying him £100 for the loss of his goods. This seems rather a doubtful claim in the circumstances, as the fault appears to have been due to the neglect of Lynch’s agent to insure the goods against robbery. Claim No. 22.—Again merely an extract from the Legation register concerning Messrs. Lynch’s claim for 6,612-95 krans for nineteen cases of provisions shipped from London on Lynch’s account for subsequent sale to Jemshid Shahrian.Such documents as the Legation possessed in these two cases are said to be missing. Seemingly, therefore, unless and until precise documentary evidence in regard to these and other Naib Hussein robbery claims is forthcoming from Lynch’s or the insurance company concerned it will be difficult to make any headway with them. Claim No. 13 a.— This also is a Naib Hussein robbery case preferred by Messrs. Roditi, of Manchester (a firm which has now dissolved partnership). Ilhey claimed £668 12s. Id. for sixty-one packages of goods looted, consisting of cottons and woollens. These goods had been insured by them, but only for invoice value (the insurance company is not mentioned), and the actual claim of the firm is much less, since they say that of the total of £668 12s. Id. part would have to be refunded to the underwriters. The documents relating to these goods had been sold by Messrs. Roditi to the Imperial Bank of Persia, and they attached a number of paid cheques showing that they repaid to that bank the greater part of the amount claimed. There is, however, no statutory declaration or other precise documentary evidence concerning the robbery, and it rather looks as if the claim merges into the larger Lynch claims mentioned above, concerning which we are still in want of precise details and the insurance company claims (if any) still awaited. Claim No. 14—Miss Ross claimed 633 krans for assault and highway robbery in the Ears district in 1911. A previous similar claim by the same lady had been paid by the Persian Government ex gratia, but as regards this second claim we have nothing but statements and the fact that it was duly preferred by our Legation against the Persian Government on the 30th October, 1911. Claim No. 17.—Mr. G. Meriton, an employee of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, in charge of their Meshed line, was in December 1912, while travelling with his Gholams, driver and labourers, violently attacked by a band of Turcomans, who killed some of them and pillaged everything. Mr. Meriton claimed 5,199-45 krans for his personal losses and 5,450 krans for the outrage. The full claim, however, was for 22.311-35 krans, and formed at the time the subject of direct correspondence between the Indo-European Telegraph Department and the Persian Government. But there is nothing to show what resulted from that correspondence. The evidence consists of a letter from the director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department to the Persian Government enclosing Mr. Meriton’s report of the occurrence. Article 3 of the recent agreement with Persia of the 17th February, 1932, regarding the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Persia, says : ‘ c the high contracting parties mutually agree to cancel all debts and claims existing between them in relation to telegraph matters.” It might, therefore, be presumed that, unless the claim was previously settled, as it may well have been (for the Indo-European Telegraph Department settled many claims out of their Terminal Rate and Traffic Account), the major part, if not the whole, of the claim of Mr. Meriton and his party founded on the incident of 1912 may probably have disappeared in view of this stipulation. Claim No. 20.—The Persian Transport Company claimed 5.666-65 krans for damage done to five of their guest-houses on the Tehran-Kum Road by Bakhtiari and Shahsevend tribesmen during 1911. The evidence consists of a detailed list of articles looted with their assessed values, and the amount was claimed from the Persian Government by our legation on the 3rd April, 1912. Claim No. 23.—This is an underwriter’s claim preferred through Messrs. Penning and Shepard (74 Cornhill and Lloyds’), and the names Messrs. Hogg and Heath (33 Cornhill) were given as adjusters. It relates to a payment of £140 6s. hd. for a highway robbery of goods on the 17th March, 1912, on the Tehran-Isfahan Road, of which Messrs. Penning and Shepard were notified by Lynch’s, who asked that the amount should be credited to their account. Certain original documents were furnished to this office by Messrs. Penning and Shepard, and copies were made of these and sent to our Legation, the originals being returned to that firm. The claim was preferred to the Persian Government by our Legation on the 13th January, 1914. The names of the firms mentioned cannot be traced in the London Directory, 1933, but it is possible that Lloyds’ may have information about them, and in any case Messrs. Lynch should have record of the event. Claim No. 75.—Mira Jan, described as a British Indian subject, claimed 300 tomans, or compensation in kind, for the loss of six camels shot on the38 m 1st September, 1921, by a rebellious gendarmerie force operating near Meshed against loyalist tribesmen. His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed obtained from the local Karguzar a written promise that six camels of equal value would be handed over in compensation, but later the Karguzar said that he had referred the matter to the Persian Government, who held that the camels were probably killed at the time of fighting, and that it was uncertain whether they were killed by the gendarmerie or by the tribes who were attacking the latter^ that the. Shamser force was not liable to pay compensation ; and that the owner’s loss was! due to his own carelessness in taking the animals into the fighting sphere. Later the Persian Government informed Sir P. Loraine that the guilty parties had never been discovered, and that it was impossible to establish responsibility for the killing of camels while fighting was going on at night time. This claim rests mainly on the definite promise given in the first instance by the local authority that the camels would be replaced, and we are furnished with copies of the correspondence to this effect. Claim No. 79.—This is a claim which comes within the war period, since it arose in 1919-20, but it might be regarded as having some of the elements of a contractual claim. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Wolseley Haig (formerly political agent and consul-general in Persia and now Albany Herald in Scotland) claimed £4,807 for breach of an undertaking that he would receive employment in the Persian Service (as he thought, as adviser in the Ministry of the Interior). His claim rests upon a letter dated the 31st May, 1920. from the then Persian Prime Minister, Vossugh-ed-Dowleh, to the effect that he was admitted to the Persian Service, that the terms of contract and the designation of the post would be settled definitely later, and that the service would date from his retirement from the British Service in August 1920. This letter was in Sir W. Haig’s possession, and the view taken of it here in 1921 was that it constituted a distinct undertaking. Our Legation were accordingly instructed to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government held them definitely responsible for the losses incurred through the non-fulfilment of this undertaking, and the Legation did so on the 14th December, 1921. Sir Wolseley Haig estimated the expenses he had been put to in making adequate preparations for the promised appointment (travelling expenses of self! wife and family, provision of furniture, plate, &amp;c., suitable, as well as the compensation he should receive for his frustrated expectations, at £4.807 (though he afterwards, in conversation with our Legation, said he would be satisfied with £2,500). The Persian Government on their part maintained that the letter of their Prime Minister was a private one, that there was no contract and that the rate of prospective pay on which Sir W. Haig calculated his claim was excessive. Still, in 1921 they offered to submit the claim to arbitration, and Mr. Norman (our Charge d’Affaires) reported that he had had an offer of £2,500 from them in full settlement. Both these offers, however, Sir W. Haig at the time refused. In commenting on this claim in 1924 Sir P. Loraine considered Sir W. Hai«' was largely to blame for the non-success of the claim made on his behalf—his original claim was exaggerated, he was verbally offered arbitration and later £2,500, and refused both, though he afterwards reduced his claim to the latter amount. CZam Ao. 88.—This is the important claim of the Persian Transport Company for the cancellation of their road and toll concessions in November 1921. For this breach of the concessions the company claimed some £76,000. the amount of capital said to have been expended on the construction of the roads plus some portable equipment seized, but they offered in 1921 to accept £50.000 on condition of a prompt settlement, which, however, has not matured feir It. Hoare has recently taken up the matter anew with the Persian Govern ment, and the company have furnished material for this representation which is about to go forward The claim is one in the forefront of our' proposed settlements with the Persian Government, and the company are no doubt in a position to produce all such documentary evidence as may be necessary to establish their various contentions. J Claim No. 89.—This was a large claim by six British Indian sublets (unnamed) for an extensive robbery of their goods in September 1921 on the i ezd Kerman Koad, amounting to a claimed value of 238 454 • 38 krans The correspondence between Sir P. Loraine and the Persian Government shows thatthe latter took certain measures, which were to an extent successful, in retrieving some small part of the goods, while at the same time they denied their responsibility for affording any compensation for the loss of the remainder. On his part Sir P. Loraine definitely maintained their liability for the losses. Unfortunately, it is added that there is little to go on in the case, as His Majesty’s consul at Kerman had never furnished full details, and that no ^further attempt had been made to press the claim upon the Persian Government since 1923. Search among the Kerman returns fails to add anything, and we have accordingly neither the names of the claimants nor other evidence to support this claim of some thirteen years’ standing, and in the circumstances it is not clear how it can be further pursued unless fresh material can be brought forward. Claim No. 93.—This is perhaps the most important claim of all. The Persian Railway Syndicate claim £202,207, with accrued interest, amounting in 1932 to a total of £326,082 25. Id., for the costs of survey of certain specified railway routes in Persia. Their claim depends upon options granted them in 1920 by the then Persian Government, and the material clause on which their claim is based runs : ‘ £ Should the Persian Government, after the expiry of the periods mentioned, decide not to construct the railways as State railways, and should the syndicate not be agreeable to accepting a concession on reasonable and practicable terms, then the Persian Government shall give notice that, after six months following the above-mentioned period, they will take over the plans and surveys and pay for them at a price equal to the cost thereof and interest thereon.” The contention of the Persian Government is, in short, that the options given were never sanctioned by the Majlis, and so were not in accord with article 26 of the Fundamental Law; an argument which, as Sir R. Hoare has pointed out, was untenable, as no Majlis was in existence at any of the material dates. In 1933, however, the Persian Government still maintained their view; if the syndicate were not satisfied they might refer the matter to the competent courts, in which event the Persian Government would set forth in detail their arguments and evidence in support of the non-existence of their responsibility. It was ascertained that by the phrase &lt;£ competent courts ” the Persian courts of justice were meant. In November 1933 the Persian Railway Syndicate wrote to say they were prepared to compromise for the actual costs of the survey, viz., £134.653 85 . 2d.\ if this offer was not accepted their original claim would hold good. Later, in March 1934, they furnished an opinion on their case by Sir Leslie Scott, and in April a further statement of account, plus interest, amounting in all to £348,907 175. Claim No. 96.—This is a claim for arrears of salaries and pension allowances of officers of the Indian Medical Service formerly employed in the Persian Gulf Quarantine Service. The period for which these arrears are claimed is from the 1st July, 1923, to the 30th June, 1924, and the amount due is stated by our Legation to be 69,967 10 rupees and 16,814 krans. The Persian Gulf Quarantine Service remained under the supervision of British medical officers until 1928, when, by agreement with the Persian Govern ment, it came to an end. The correspondence shows that these quarantine arrangements were confided to British medical officers about as far back as 1864; their services, however, rested upon no contract or written agreement, though their presence had been recognised in numerous ways by the Persian Government and the service expanded and elaborated from time to time with their express approval. Down to 1928 their salaries appear to have been paid by the Persian authorities out of the local Customs Administration funds, with the exception of the period in 1923-24 for which they are claimed, and the reason for this omission is said to be obscure, but appears to have been due to some overlapping of accounts, which resulted in the payments for the period mentioned not having- been sanctioned by the Majlis. As apart from some budgetary difficulties in framing estimates, it is not clear that the Persian Government really disputed the right of these British officers to be paid for work which they were efficiently rendering up to the time when the Quarantine Service was in 1928 handed over to the Persian authorities. But the correspondence seems to have passed mainly at Tehran, and I cannot find that we have any very accurate particulars here of the payments made to these officers in such detail as to make evident the precise deficiency left in suchpayments by the gap between the 1st July, 1923, and the 30th June, 1924. If the claim is pursued it seems necessary that we should have a clear and detailed statement of the position, and this would apparently have to be got either Irom our Legation at Tehran or from the Government of India through the India Office, preferably the latter, since it is likely to be more fully documented. The above constitute all the Legation peace-time claims of any substance^ There are two others (Nos. 94 and 98), one for a robbery by a Mesopotamian tribe, who had crossed the frontier in 1923 and stolen goods valued by a Bagdad 111 ™ at 450 rupees; and the other for the alleged robbery from a member of the Imperial Bank of Persia near Isfahan in 1911 of articles valued at 8.421 krans, but there is nothing furnished on which these claims could be properly based. Appendix 4. Index and Introduction to the Supplementary Volume* of Memoranda entitled il Persia: Consulate Claims {Peace Time) {Persia 36). Consulate Claims. (With the exception of those arising during the War Period, i.e., from August 4, 1914, to February 1921.) The claims are returned by the fourteen consulates in three separate categories, viz. :— {a) Those deemed supported by adequate evidence. {h) Those deemed supported by inadequate evidence. (c) Those materially lacking in evidence. But, as shown in the introductory remarks on these claims, this classification cannot be wholly relied on. For the purpose of the index and the statement of these claims which is within, however, the classification has been retained, and each claim is indicated accordingly as {a), {h) or (c) as returned by the consuls.

The Consulate Claims (Peace-Time). A main distinction between the Legation claims and the consulate claims is that in the case of the former we are furnished with little but correspondence, and must look to the claimants themselves to supply any requisite detailed documentary evidence; whereas in the case of the consulate claims we are furnished with all such evidence as can now be traced in the consulate archives, though much of it has been lost or destroyed. It is a question therefore of investigating this evidence to see whether it would be likely to stand the test of a tribunal. The lists furnished by the fourteen consulates set out 626 claims, but of these only 274 are supported by evidence deemed sufficient to establish the existence of the claim, while a division is made between those placed in category (a), as deemed by the consuls to afford conclusive evidence, and those placed by them in category (6), as not backed by complete and adequate evidence. There is a further category (c) relating to claims they do not deem worthy of presentation. There are in all 202 claims in category (a) and seventy-two in category (b). The proposal to exclude war-time claims (i.e., those between the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921) will reduce these numbers to 145 (a) claims and sixty-seven (b) claims.* There are a few in category (c) which might be given consideration. In the present volume relating to peace-time claims we have therefore to investigate the evidence which is available in some 220 cases. The great majority relate to highway robberies, of which there are about 160 cases; the remainder may be grouped as miscellaneous claims, under their respective heads. In the attached statement each set of claims has been arranged chronologically as follows :— Highway robbery (a) claims. Highway robbery (b) claims. Highway robbery (c) claims. The miscellaneous claims follow under the heads of— Assaults. Burglaries and caravanserai robberies. Civil disturbances. Consulate-general, Isfahan, damage to. Customs losses. Debts. Murders. Piracies. Postal losses. Requisitions. Thefts. Tribal raids. As might be expected in returns made by fourteen different consulates, there are considerable differences between the amount of evidence furnished, the way in which it is set forth and the views of the respective consuls as to its sufficiency or otherwise. No great reliance can be placed on their assignment of claims to category (a) or (b ); and while it is clear that some of those placed in (a) ought to be in (b), it is doubtful whether some of those in (b) might not appear in (a). It seems necessary to investigate them all. ;11541 G 2In each case the claim is prefaced by a statement by the consul se ing on the facts. Often this gives a full description of the claim, the manner in w ic it arose, the steps taken and the views of the consul as to the liability o e Persian Government; in many cases, however, the description is meagre an incomplete. This statement is usually signed by the consul, and might then be deemed evidence compiled from the consulate records; but in the case ot fehiraz (which returns most claims) it is not signed. To this statement such evidence a^ is available is attached, and consists as a rule of certified copies of correspondent and other documentary proof; in the case of Shiraz, however, this evidence is embodied in the consul’s statement (a rather inconvenient form). In a good many instances the copies are not certified as correct, whether by oversight or not is not mentioned; it may be that this is due to the original documents not being now available, but, if so, this should have been stated for our information. It might perhaps be premised that (apart from the question whether a particular offence might justify a claim on the Central Government) the following evidence would be desirable for the establishment of a claim :— (1) The claimant’s original representation, setting out the facts, the date of the occurrence, details of the property lost or other damage done, with their estimated value, as well as proof of the claimant’s British nationality. (2) The evidence of any witnesses to the occurrence—muleteer, camelman or others present. (3) The notification made to the local authorities with such correspondence as took place. (4) The notification to His Majesty’s Legation, for inclusion in the annual statement furnished to the Persian Government, or it might be special representation. (5) The sworn deposition of the claimant, if necessary, testifying to the validity of his claim. This numeration is accordingly adopted in the annexed statement of claims in dealing with the evidence furnished. It will be seen that in a great many cases the evidence is defective in one or other of these respects. In general it might be said as regards— (1) We are not always furnished with the precise facts of the case or the precise date of the occurrence; and where a precise date is given it is not always clear whether this is the date of the occurrence or of the claim made; while in no case is there any separate proof of the claimant’s British nationality, apart from his description as such, or (mostly in the case of Orientals) that he is registered in the consulate as such. (2) The evidence of witnesses is mostly wanting; though in the case of the highway robberies mention is sometimes made of the availability of the muleteer to make such a statement, or that his declaration cannot now be traced. (3) The date of notification to the local authority is usually given, but the correspondence which passed is often fragmentary or entirelv wanting. (4) The date of notification to the Legation is usually given, but not the correspondence, while the date given appears often to be the final &gt;, date, after all local remedy had been exhausted. In cases prior to 1911 the Legation archives (which we have here up to the end of 1910) provide some slight additional evidence regarding the action taken at Tehran, but usually the representations made by our Legation to the Persian Government seem to have been of a general character, calling for early settlement of blocks of claims which had arisen in some district without naming them specifically; sometimes the Persian script alone appears, and sometimes the papers are missing from the volumes of correspondence. But most claims arose subsequent to 1910, and in these the Legation furnish no additional correspondence from their archives, though their register (which we have up to 1913) mentions several; in that year a new system was set up under which the Persian Government were supplied annually with a tabular statement of the claims unsettled at the various consulates.(5) There are but few sworn depositions made by claimants at the time of the occurrence, and some of these are shown to have been lost. At Isfahan and Shiraz especially the consuls seem to have realised in 1925 (when these returns were called for) that it would be well to fortify such evidence as remained in the consulates by getting from the claimants sworn depositions in support. There are a fair number of these late-hour depositions, which would have been better procured at the time of occurrence. In the last-mentioned respect some British firms which subsequently went into liquidation seem to suffer disadvantage from the inability of the liquidators now to furnish sworn depositions as to the ownership and value of the goods formerly robbed, though in other respects the evidence in their case may be as good as in the case of other firms. One such firm—H. C. Dixon and Co., Manchester—has quite a number of claims, and it is noticed that, while some consuls place their claims in category {a), other consuls place them in category (b) on account of the liquidators’ inability to furnish such sworn deposition. There is a noticeable absence of information about insurers’ claims, though in many instances the goods lost seem to have been insured against loss. Lloyds are mentioned once or twice; unnamed insurers are occasionally referred to; and in one extensive robbery of goods belonging to Castelli Brothers, an Italian concern, there is a reference in the Tehran register to a Lloyds’ claim for £220 in 1910. The administrative areas into which Persia was divided furnish instances of claims which were repudiated by one local authority on the ground that the delinquents came from another jurisdiction, while the latter administration burked the claim because the offence was committed outside its authority. In such instances the consuls hold the Central Government responsible, though Shiraz sometimes places the claim in category (b) on this ground alone. It is, of course, apparent that of the 626 claims shown on the lists furnished by the fourteen consulates the loss or destruction of evidence, which it may be assumed was at the time furnished by the various claimants, leaves a very considerable gap; and it may be that some of these claimants—more especially British commercial firms—may yet endeavour to reassert these defective claims, and perhaps furnish additional evidence from their records to replace what has been lost or destroyed. At Kermanshah, e.g., we are told that all the evidence in support of some seventy claims has been destroyed, and at Ahwaz, Bandar Abbas and Bushire similar, if smaller, losses are said to have occurred; while it is evident from the statement of the claims which is attached hereto that a great deal of the original evidence which existed in furtherance of the claims recited is now no longer available. Certain claims by Bahreinis, figuring in the past as British-protected persons, have been omitted in the attached statement, as I gather that we do not now intend to assert their claims against the Persian Government.

(Arising during the War Period, viz., between August 4, 1914, and February 1921.) These claims, like the others, are returned by the various consulates in three separate categories, viz. :— (a) Those they deem supported by adequate evidence. (b) Those they deem supported by incomplete evidence. (c) Those materially lacking in evidence.

Most of the important claims arising during the war period (the 4th August, 1914, to February 1921) come from the Legation, and are included in the compilation dealing with the Legation claims; but a fair number, mainly relating to highway robberies, are returned by our consulates, and these are set out in the attached statement. These consulate claims arising during the war period are in general subject to the same observations as those arising out of the war period. These observations might be briefly summarised as follows :— (1) Much of the evidence originally furnished has been lost or cannot now be traced. (2) Not much reliance can be placed on the allocation of the claims to categories {a), (b) or (c), according as the evidence is deemed by our consuls to be respectively conclusive, incomplete or materially lacking. Many claims placed in (a) are sadly lacking in evidence, and there are manifest differences of view among the various consuls as to what may constitute an (a), (b) or (c) claim. Nevertheless, this allocation has been retained in the attached statement, as it represents what the consuls, with their local knowledge, think of the claims. (3) There is a noticeable absence of information about insurers’ claims, although mention is made of several. In the attached statement each set of claims has been arranged chronologically as follows :— Highway robbery (a) claims. Highway robbery (b) claims. Highway robbery (c) claims. The miscellaneous claims follow under the heads of— Burglaries. Evacuations of Persian towns. Murder. Postal losses. Resht disturbances, 1920-21. Shiraz outrages. Theft. Tribal raid. Urumia, depredations in, 1914-18. As regards the highway robbery claims, the country was no doubt in a highly unsettled state during the war period, and it is fairly clear that the Persian Government, during part of this period at any rate, had no adequate control over the disaffected districts. The miscellaneous claims relate to events which are mostly easily identifiable, such as evacuations of Persian towns, local outrages against British subjects, and the like, concerning which other and more definite evidence exists in our records. In dealing with the other sets of claims outside the war period, it was premised that (apart from the question whether a particular claim justified a claim on the Central Government) the following evidence would be desirable for the establishment of a claim :— (1) The claimant’s original representation, setting out the facts, the date of the occurrence, details of the loss or damage done, as well as proof of the claimant’s British nationality.(2) The evidence of any witnesses to the occurrence. (3) The notification made to the local authorities, with such correspondence as took place. (4) The notification to His Majesty’s Legation, for inclusion in the annual statement furnished to the Persian Government, or, it might be, special representation. (5) The sworn deposition of the claimant, if necessary, testifying to the validity of his claim. This numeration is accordingly adopted in the annexed statement of the war claims in dealing with the evidence furnished. It will be seen that in many instances the evidence is defective in one or other of these respects. Generally, it might be said as regards— (1) We are not always furnished with the precise facts or the precise date of occurrence; while in no case is there any separate proof of the claimant’s British nationality, apart from his description as such. (2) The evidence of witnesses is mostly wanting. (3) The date of notification to the local authorities is usually given, but the correspondence which passed is often fragmentary or entirely wanting. (4) The date of notification to the Legation is usually given, but not the correspondence. (5) There are but few sworn depositions made by claimants, and what there are have been furnished a good many years after the event, usually to amplify incomplete evidence now available. It seems possible, more especially in the case of British firms, that, where the evidence of the claim is incomplete, these may yet be able to furnish from their records further corroboration of the events for which they claim.Grand Total ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 15,004,686 361,809 238,689 6,962 39 and 65 (Grand Total as stated by Mr. Ritchie ... ... ... ... 15,228,725( 8 ) 361,810 240,305 6,962), . :..todt)/34.

[E 1946/346/34] No. 1. Sir R. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 27.) (No. 126.) Sir, Tehran, March 10, 1934. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 95 of the 22nd February respecting the claims article in the draft General Treaty with Persia. 2. I have no further observations to offer at present. I have always contem plated that a strong effort should be made to secure the acceptance of the formula excluding war claims which is at present under consideration (see article 13 in the memorandum enclosed in your despatch No. 50 of the 25th January), and my object in writing my earlier despatch was to ensure that consideration should be given to the question of principle (that is, the virtual abandonment or otherwise of the non-war British claims) which would arise if the effort failed. 3. It is quite possible that the third of the hypotheses set forth in the middle of paragraph 4 of your despatch is correct and, if so, the Persian Government will presumably accept the formula which His Majesty’s Government have in mind. I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. [65 dd—1]4 . ^ 1 P. z. 3187 I934 ^ 5.34672/9. 11th May, 1934. i&gt;«&amp;r hendol.

The position is fully examined in the foreign Office reply of 22nd February. 4. The Government of India are unlikely to have any strong views on the points in issue.

During the last two or three years there has been a considerable three-cornered correspondence on this eubject between Trickett, the India Office and ourselves, but you will find the essential points eumrarieed on pages 2P-26 of the long memorandum (\nnex I) enclosed in our despatch No.60 of the £ 6 th January to Tehran, of which we sent you a copy officially under cover of our letter No. E 580/169/64 of the 1st February. £. The detailed investigations which we are now pursuing in connexion with the categorising of the claims files recently received from Tehran have led ue to reconsider the provisional draft given on pages 26 and £6 of the memorandum referred to above. The draft has not yet been discussed with the Persians, and we have now reached the conclusion, subject to your views and those of the India Office (to whom we are writing separately an this subject) that the following modifications are desirable. (a) The words w were directly due to those 'circumstances ind which should be omitted fro* paragraph/ FORK ION )FFICK , f .V .1. 1st larch, 1934. ifcoode, Esc,., K.V .0's paragraph ( 1 ) of the draft treaty article. (h) The worde the corapetent authorities of should be inserted before 'the other High Contracting ' arty' in paragraph 2 of the treaty article. (c. If, as is probable, the Persians decline to agree that the proceedinge before the tribunal should be in « 3 rench and ; nglieh , article 8 of the Protocol or Annex should be re-drafted as followsj- ”The written proceedings of the tribunal shall 'be in the ' rench language, but the agents and 'counsel appointed by the respective High Contracting 'Parties shall he permitted to plead in their own 'language, their speeches being translated into 'French if aid when necessary'. 3. Of these three amendments, (c) is self-explanatory, (bj seems to ue desirable, in view of the fact that certain minor British claims were ap; arently never included in the recapitulatory lists of claims which the Tehran Legation presented from time to time to the Central Government of Tehran, but were merely forwarded by His ?&lt;aj«sty , » Consular Officers to the local Persian Governors. (c) is the only point of any importance; the words which we now propose to omit were, of course, originally intended to enable us to exclude from the scope of the barrer clause a variety of British claims which have no real connexion with war conditions In Persia. In theory such a distinction is a reasonable one, but our legal advisers, who have gone into the question very carefully, have now reached the conclusion that/that In practice the phraee nould provoke endiees argurocnt and would clog the whole machinery of the claims settlement. In addition, it would inevitably give rise to much public discussion regarding the violation of Persian neutrality by British forces (among others) during the war. This, of course, would be highly embarrassing (indeed, the desire to avoid such public discussion of the war period in Persia has always been one of oar main reasons for proposing to incorporate the barrer clause in the draft article) and would incidentally be only too likely to influence the neutral arbiters agaim t us. 4 . Ve hope, then, that in the light of the explanationt: given above you will be able to concur in the three amendments in question. The matter is rather urgent, as until we receive your concurrence and that of the India Office we cannot finally dispose of another treaty question regarding which the Dominions will have to be consulted. 6. I am sending copies of this letter to Laithwaite at the India Office and Wiseman at the Dominions Office.« ul FOREIGN OFFICE, S./.I. 1 „ (E 355/346/34) Important -J tf 'Ml (£)Q^ jp&amp;r* rtf' ■»/?

IPiDIA OFFICE My dear Gilbert, I send you herewith copies of correspondence exchanged with Hoare on the subject of the draft claims article and protocol in the Anglo-Persian treaty, and the bearing of the Atychides claim on this draft. 2. As time is short, we felt justified in sending off our reply, which merely states our own views, without consulting you beforehand. Hoare, as you will see, has not yet been authorised to broach the question with the Persians, but it is of course very desirable that he should at the earliest moment be given the word 'go', and I should therefore be grateful if you would let me know as soon as possible whether you concur. Owing to arrangements which we recently made with the Dominions /Office, T T r R i I - ‘ OOPY SENT BY AIR MAIL of . 2 m 1Sj4 INDIA 0FFIC||Office, it will no longer be necessary to delay action pending the consent of each separate dominion to the wording proposed for the claims draft: the Dominions will merely be informed of the gist of the draft, and told that we are going ahead on this basis. Consequently, all that is now required before we authorize Hoare to adopt the draft definitively is your concurrence, and the Treasury’s, in the minor alterations referred to in paragraph 7 of the despatch to him. And of these alterations, the only one of substance is that which comprises the deletion of the words ' were directly due to those circumstances ’’and which ” from paragraph 1 of the treaty article. Our reasons for recommending this deletion are given in the despatch; the matter has been gone into very carefully by our legal advisers, who now feel that it would be impracticable to attempt to draw a distinction between those war claims ('other than 'those arising out of contractual obligations') which were directly due to war conditions, and those which /were uXX . were not. The attempt, they feel, would merely result in our getting hopelessly bogged, and would hence prejudice the success of the claims negotiations as a whole. I enclose a copy of a letter which I am sending to woods at the Treasury on this subject.COPY (E 355/346/34) No. 609 British Legation, ’ f , Tehran. * 29th December Sir, I have the honour to inform you that a certain Ali Khan Muqtadir, a Young Persian who might be described as a 'lobbyist”, recently called upon the Oriental Secretary in order to inform him that Monsieur Socrates .^tychides was now in Tehran. Monsieur Atychides, as you are aware, has a claim against His Majesty's G-overnment in the United Kingdom (or the G-overnment of on account of the detention and subsequent condemnation as a prize of his ship, the ‘'Kara Deniz' at Bombay in 1914. This claim last formed the subject of correspondence between your department and the Legation in the autumn of 1932, when the Persian Government who support the claim on the ground that Monsieur Atychides, an Ottoman subject by origin, became a naturalised Persian subject in 1911, announced their intention of bringing it to the notice of the League of Nations. They did not, however, put this intention into effect (see Mr. Rendel's letter E 6136/208/34 of December 7th, 1932). 2. Ali Khan Muqtadir states that Monsieur Atychides, who is now about sixty years of age, had come to Tehran, bringing all his documents with him, with the object of pressing his claim. He had deputed Muqtadir to sound the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The latter had £900.000 India) for a sum of about nine hundred thousand pounds The Right Honourable /done Sir John Simon, G.O.S.I., etc*, etc*, etc •, The Foreign Office.done so and had been told that the Atyohides claim was to appear among the Persian claims which would come up for settlement when the outstanding questions between the British and Persian Grovernments were brought to a head. It was hoped that this would be in about two months 1 time. The Persian Government were prepared, in the last resort, to take the case to the League of Nations, and they felt confident that if this was done their case was so strong that they would certainly -win and obtain very large damages. But they wished, for the moment, to have this claim as a counter-weight to the claims which the British Government were making against the Persian Government. Muqtadir said (in strict confidence) that his informant was Shayesteh, the head of the European and American Section at the Ministry. 3. Monsieur -rtychides had come to Tehran this time at the expense of a French financial group, which was hoping to make use of his claim to do business with Persia. They had arranged with Atychides to pay him thirty per cent of the profits realised from the claim, the remainder go ing to the French group, which would then come to an agreement with the Persian Government to provide them free with eight freight steamers to be used in developing the trade of Persia through the port of Bander Shah pur. 4. Atychides was, however, tired of the delay in the settlement of the claim and Muqtadir thought that he could be induced to offer to come to terms with His Majesty 1 s Government independently. He did not know on what terms he would negotiate, but he proposed to ask him to state definite terms. In that case Monsieur Atychides would doubtless write a letter to the Legation setting forth those terms. 5. Ali Khan Muqtadir has been informed that I /havehave no desire to receive any offer from Monsieur Atychides. All the same, his information throws valuable light upon the intentions of the Persian Grovernment and I venture in the following paragraphs to offer some observations upon the position regarding the claims article in the general treaty negotiations. 6. The question of excluding the Atychides claim from consideration under the treaty is not so simple as it has seemed hitherto. The refusal of the Persian Government to entertain fT war TT claims is contained in two letters from -tf'iruz Mirza, the Minister of Finance, to the Imperial Bank of Persia, dated January 22nd and April 29th, 1929, about the claims of the Bank against the Persian Government for losses suffered during the war, and may also have been asserted orally in the course of the negotiations. At any rate, during the last two years the Foreign Office and the Legation have been intent on devising a formula for the claims article which shall exclude all claims arising out of the war from consideration by any claims tribunal which may be set up under the treaty, partly out of deference to Persian prejudice on the point and partly in order to exclude the Atychides claim. But this formula, the exact 7/ording of which is still under discussion, has never been presented to the Persian Government. Alien it is presented, they can hardly fail to seize its implications, and it seems likely that their views on 'war' claims will then undergo a violent change. 7. They would probably start by trying to secure such a definition of claims classified as 'war' claims (and therefore excluded) as would restrict them to those which arose out of events taking place in* Persia during the period when the Government was precluded by the presence of foreign troops from exercising full control over her territory (the /incapacityincapacity of the Government being conveniently ignored), 8, If this attempt failed, the Persian Government would perhaps agree to submit claims of all kinds to the claims commission, relying upon the commission when it came to the point to accept their contention that they were not morally or legally responsible for claims arising out of events which occurred during the occupation of Persian soil by foreign troops. 9. I should then apparently be obliged to tell them (see Lord Monteagle^ letter E 1776/642/34 of April 11th, 1929 to Sir Robert Clive) that it must be understood that no prize cases could be submitted to the commission. The Persian Government would presumably respond by declining to have a claims article in the treaty at all, or else by suggesting an article washing out all claims on either side. 10. If this last suggestion were accepted it would mean that the chances, such as they were, of securing payment for the British claimants, some of whom at any rate have claims which are good both morally and legally, had been surrendered in order to avoid a counter-claim which is either (a) good or (b) bad. If the counter-claim is good the British claimants would (whether they realised the fact or not) be in the position of having paid for its withdrawal: in other words of having made their fellow tax-payers a present of many thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of pounds. If it is bad, they would not even have this vicarious consolation; their interests would have been sacrificed to no purpose. 11. If, however, the suggestion of a mutual waiver were refused, each side would be free to pursue its claims as best it could. The Persian Government might then takethe Atychides case to the League of Nations. So far as the prize law issue was concerned, I understand that His Majesty^ Government could refuse to submit to a fresh investigation on the ground that the case had been heard by British courts applying international law and was chose jugee . But the question of the detention of the “Kara Deniz' at Bombay prior to the outbreak of war with Turkey on November 5th, 1914, might not be so easy to explain, and this, with Monsieur Atychides’ arrest in Bombay in 1917, might end in adverse decision (compare the case of Monsieur Chevreau). At any rate, the League might ask His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government to consult together, on the analogy of the Finnish Ships case, with a view to ascertaining whether Monsieur Atychides had exhausted his legal remedies at Bombay. 12. In any case, His Majesty’s Government would presumably be bound to insist, whatever doubts they might have as to the validity of some of the British claims, that the League took up the claims of both sides together. This again would probably end in compromise, that is, a waiver all round, and in this case I suppose it is not impossible that there might be some political agitation from, for example, the Persian Railway Syndicate or the Manchester Chamber of Commerce (for Messrs. Ziegler and Company) for compensation from His Majesty’s Government. In any case, the ultimate result could be no worse and might even be slightly better if a claims article admitting all manner of claims to arbitration were accepted in the first place, unless indeed the Atychides claim is in reality a sound one and all the British claims unsound. 13. I understand that the detention of the ’’Kara Deniz” at Bombay can be explained in a manner that would probably satisfy an international tribunal, although the archives of the/the Legation do not disclose what this explanation is. I suppose there were also good grounds for the detention of Monsieur Atychides himself in Bombay in 1917, after he had arrived there with the permission of the authorities in India, and for the other matters set forth by Monsieur Atychides in his printed memorial to the King of November 17th, 1923. If, however, full information on these points is not already available, I venture, at the risk of intruding into matters which are not my concern, to suggest that the fullest possible details should be collected regarding the events at Bombay of 1914 and 1917 - 1919. My excuse for so doing must be the importance which this case is likely to play in the treaty negotiations and the immense expenditure in which His Majesty’s Government would be involved if the claim were found to be valid. 14. So far as the archives of the Legation are concerned, it would be useful if I might receive ( 1 ) the judgments (and the full proceedings also, if readily available) of the prize Court at Bombay in 1915 and the Privy Council in 1922, and of the Court (l am not clear whether it was a Prize Court or not) before which Monsieur Atychides appeared at Bombay in 1919, as being of general interest, and (2) the India Office letter with the report about the detention of the 'Kara Deniz' referred to in the enclosure to Lord Monteagle’s private letter to Sir R. Clive already quoted in paragraph 9, with any other information on this point, as being of essential interest. 15.

As regards the latter point, it is true that aa yet the Persian Government have presented but few claims against His mjoet^fl Government, and that the British claims article and protocol, as provisionally draftoa, but not yet dlsctisoed with the ‘Crsion rTOvernment. contains a limiting clause providing that only those claims shall l&gt;e dealt with which wore presented to the other party before the let January. 19&amp;B« It is. however, only reasonable to assume that if* as you anticipate, the ioroicn Government press for the omission of the clause barring nor claims, they will press with ocuol insistence for tho omission of this limiting clause, which would automatically rule out tho claims which they ore believed to bo concocting at the present time. 6.

In February 1932 Teymourtache proposed the following :— Les Hautes Parties Contractantes sont convenues de regler les reclama tions existantes des sujets de Tune des parties a regard du Gouvernement de Fautre par un protocole qui sera sign^ entre leurs representants respectifs ou la modalite de 1’examen, la resolution du dift’erend concernant ladite reclamation et sa liquidation seront indiqu^es. 3. In putting forward this draft, Teymourtache said that what he had in mind was the establishment of a claims commission and the definition of the commission’s functions. 4. The obvious objection to the draft from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government is that it relegates the whole process to the indefinite future. The protocol (if a protocol rather than an annex is finally decided on) will have to be agreed on before the conclusion of the treaty, and will presumably be annexed thereto. 5. As regards the terms of the covering article and protocol (or annex), several drafts have been considered by the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s repre sentatives at Tehran and, more recently, by the other Departments concerned. Annexed hereto is (A) the text of the most recent draft to be circulated in full, semi-officially, to the Treasury and India Office, (B) a list of alterations and corrections arising out of subsequent semi-official correspondence and further independent discussion at the Foreign Office, and (C) a revised draft, giving the presumed latest form of the article and annex, but incorporating certain passages not yet finally agreed to by the other Departments concerned.23 6. In recent months the looming up of the Persian “ Atychides ” (alias “ Hamadan,” alias ‘‘Kara Deniz ”) claim, and certain reports received from Tehran to the effect that the Persians were known to be busy concocting large numbers of counter-claims for the war period, led the Foreign Office to reconsider the whole question afresh, and to conclude that before reaching any final decision regarding the text of the claims article and annex it would be necessary for an expert to re-examine in detail all outstanding British claims and weed out the ^ large number which, it is believed, are hopelessly unsound. The files containing these are at present being investigated in the Foreign Office. Annex. (A)— Latest Complete Text Circulated to the Departments concerned. Draft Article XIII. Each of the High Contracting Parties, recognising the exceptional circum stances obtaining during the world war, agrees not to pursue against the other claims, not being in respect of contractual obligations, which were directly due to those circumstances and which arose out of acts done or events taking place between the dates of the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921. 2. The High Contracting Parties agree that all other claims of one High Contracting Party which had been formally presented to the Government of the other High Contracting Party before the 1st January, 1928, shall be settled in the manner provided for in the Annex to the present Article. Annex to Article 13. Article 1. All claims which either High Contracting Party desires to present for settlement in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article XIII shall be notified to the Government of the other not later than six months from the date of the entry into force of the Treaty. Article 2. Unless all claims notified by one High Contracting Party to the other in accordance with the preceding paragraph are settled within a period of one year from the date of the coming into force of the Treaty, all unsettled claims shall be submitted to an arbitral tribunal composed of three members, who shall be appointed in the following manner : one member appointed by the Imperial Persian Government, one member appointed by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and one member, who shall preside, appointed by the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice from persons who are not nationals of either of the High Contracting Parties. Article 3. The Arbitral Tribunal shall hold its first session at Geneva not later than two years from the entry into force of the Treaty, and shall hear, examine and decide all claims submitted to it. Its decisions shall be taken by majority vote. Article 4. The Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power of deciding any differences relating to the question whether a claim is one in respect of which it has juris diction under the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article XIII of the Treaty and Articles 1 and 2 of this Annex, or whether it is excluded under the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article XIII of the Treaty. Article 5. Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees to regard the awards of the arbitral tribunal as final and to give full and immediate effect thereto. All sums of money awarded by the tribunal on account of any claim shall be paid to the Government of the High Contracting Party by whom the claim is made not later than twelve months from the date on which the award is made.24 They further agree that all claims which might have been presented under Article i of this Annex and have not been so presented shall be considered as absolutely and irrevocably settled for the future. Article 6. The tribunal shall determine its own methods of procedure and make rules accordingly. Article 7. Each of the High Contracting Parties may appoint an Agent and Counsel to present to the tribunal, either orally or in writing, evidence or arguments in support of or in defence of claims. Article 8. The proceedings before the tribunal shall be conducted in the French language. Article 9. The tribunal may appoint such secretaries and interpreters as may be necessary. Article 10.

(B) —A ddenda and Corrigenda to the A hove. 1. Revised draft of paragraph 1 of the Treaty article (as suggested to Mr. Trickett in Mr. C. Warner’s letter of the 25th June, 1932) :— “ Each of the High Contracting Parties, recognising the exceptional circumstances obtaining during the world war, agrees not to pursue against the other claims, other than those in respect of contractual obligations, which were directly due to those circumstances and which arose out of acts done or events taking place between the dates of the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921.” 2. Revised draft of paragraph 2 of article 5 of the Annex (as suggested to Mr. Trickett in Mr. Baxter’s letter of the 29th July, 1932) :— All sums of money awarded by the tribunal on account of any claim shall be paid to the Government of the High Contracting Party by whom the claim is made on a date to be agreed upon by the High Contracting parties, or in default of any such agreement on the day which follows the expiry of twelve months from the date of the conclusion of the final session of the tribunal. If sums are payable under the awards of the tribunal by the Governments of both High Contracting Parties, the said payments shall be made by both Governments on the same date and at the same time.” 3. Tentative draft of an additional paragraph to the Treaty article (as suggested to Mr. Laithwaite in Mr. Warner’s letter of the 20th January, 1933):— “ Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees not to pursue against the other any claim arising out of events taking place before the 1st January, 1928, and not formally(‘) presented to the Government of the other High Contracting Party before that date.” This suggested addition has not, however, received the final approval of the other Departments concerned. On the assumption that it is eventually approved, the most up-to-date text of the treaty article and annex would read as follows :— ( 4 ) Mistyped as “ provisionally ” in the letter in question.25 (C )—A rticle XIII. Each of the High Contracting Parties, recognising the exceptional circum stances obtaining during the world war, agrees not to pursue against the other claims, other than those in respect of contractual obligations, which were directly due to those circumstances and which arose out of acts done or events taking place between the dates of the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921. 2.

Warner’s letter of the 25th June, 1932) :— “ Each of the High Contracting Parties, recognising the exceptional circumstances obtaining during the world war, agrees not to pursue against the other claims, other than those in respect of contractual obligations, which were directly due to those circumstances and which arose out of acts done or events taking place between the dates of the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921.” 2. Revised draft of paragraph 2 of article 5 of the Annex (as suggested to Mr. Trickett in Mr. Baxter’s letter of the 29th July, 1932) :— ' ‘ All sums of money awarded by the tribunal on account of any claim shall be paid to the Government of the High Contracting Party by whom the claim is made on a date to be agreed upon by the High Contracting parties, or in default of any such agreement on the day which follows the expiry of twelve months from the date of the conclusion of the final session of the tribunal. If sums are payable under the awards of the tribunal by the Governments of both High Contracting Parties, the said payments shall be made by both Governments on the same date and at the same time.” 3. Tentative draft of an additional paragraph to the Treaty article (as suggested to Mr. Laithwaite in Mr. Warner’s letter of the 20th January, 1933) : _ Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees not to pursue against the other any claim arising out of events taking place before the 1st January, 1928, and not formally( 4 ) presented to the Government of the other High Contracting Party before that date.” This suggested addition has not, however, received the final approval of the other Departments concerned. On the assumption that it is eventually approved, the most up-to-date text of the treaty article and annex would read as follows ( 4 ) Mistyped as “ provisionally ’ in the letter in question.25 (C )—Article XIII. Each of the High Contracting Parties, recognising the exceptional circum stances obtaining during the world war, agrees not to pursue against the other claims, other than those in respect of contractual obligations, which were directly du^to those circumstances and which jarose out of acts done or events taking pla^-e between the dates of the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921. 2. The High Contracting Parties agree that all other claims of one of the High Contracting Parties which have been formally presented to the^ Qther Hig h Contracting Party before the 1st January, 1928. shall be settled in the manner provided for in the annex to the present Article. 3. Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees not to pursue against the | other any claim arising out of events taking place before the 1st .January, 19^8/y _ and not formally presented to the^ther High Contracting Party before that date. Annex to Article XIII. Article 1. All claims which either High Contracting Party desires to present for settlement in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article XIII shall be notified to the other not later than six months from the date of the entry into force of the Treaty. Article 2. Unless all claims notified by one High Contracting Party to the other in accordance with the preceding paragraph are settled within a period of one year from the date of the coming into force of the Treaty, all unsettled claims shall be submitted to an arbitral tribunal composed of three members, who shall be appointed in the following manner: one member appointed by the Imperial Persian Government, one member appointed by the Government of the United Kingdom, and one member, who shall preside, appointed by the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice from persons who are not nationals of either of the High Contracting Parties. Article 3. The Arbitral Tribunal shall hold its first session at Geneva not later than two years from the entry into force of the Treaty, and shall hear, examine and decide all claims submitted to it. Its decisions shall be taken by majority vote. Article 4. The Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power of deciding any differences relating to the question whether a claim is one in respect of which it has juris diction under the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article XIII of the Treaty and Articles 1 and 2 of this Annex, or whether it is excluded under the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article XIII of the Treaty. Article 5. Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees to regard the awards of the arbitral tribunal as final and to give full and immediate effect thereto. All sums of money awarded by the tribunal on account of any claim shall be paid to the High Contracting Party by whom the claim is made on a date to be agreed upon by the High Contracting Parties, or in default of any such agreement on the day which follows the expiry of twelve months from the date of the conclusion of the final session of the tribunal. If sums are payable under the awards of the tribunal by both High Contracting Parties, the said payments shall be made by both High Contracting Parties on the same date and at the same time. They further agree that all claims which might have been presented under Article 1 of this Annex and have not been so presented shall be considered as absolutely and irrevocably settled for the future. [9524] Eprovisional. The question of docking facilities in India (paragraph 4) is one which can in existing circumstances well be let drop. On the question of the removal of the Residency (paragraph 5) the Foreigi Office, as you will see, have adopted the suggestion made after consulting Fowle in my demi official letter to Warner of 14th September No.P.Z.5469/33, of which copies were sent you by the air mail of 16th September, and are prepared to instruct the Minister that the question should, if at all possible, be allowed to drop. In this case a special article would be dispensed with, but there seems no reason to apprehend that difficulty should arise in view of the fact that the Resident's position in Persia would be covered by his status as Consul-General. We have assumed that the Government of India will see no objection to the proposed method of dealing with the case, but if they do will you please telegraph. As regards the substantive question of leaving or staying at Bushire neither the Goverrment of India nor the Secretary of State have ever in the past been enthusiastic about removal of the Residency, if this could be avoided, and while there are certain obvious advantages in its location on the Arab shore the expenditure which would be involved is in present financial conditions/- 4 - conditions a very strong argument against making any change unless this is quite inevitable. In these circumstances we have assumed, in the light of the views previosuly expressed by the Government of India, that they would share our view on this point. 4. I deal below with Article- I and Article III bis of the Treaty (paragraphs 6 and 7 of the draft despatch). The arrangements/for the preservation of our most-favoured nation rights and of the right,of consular representation set out in paragraph 8 of the/despatch, .are to some extent consequent on my demi official letter to Foreign Office of 14th September, No.P.Z.5469/33, to which reference is made above. The arguments for them are obvious, 5. As regards the wireless stations at Henjam, etc., the Government of India have already agreed to the transfer of the wireless apparatus at Bushire and Lingah and of the station at Henjam as part of a satisfactory treaty settlement. The alteration now proposed by the Foreign Office in paragraph 9 of the draft instructions is merely consequential on the proposal to abandon the Henjam Protocol. We see no objection to the draft instructions on this point and have assumed that the Government/- 5 - Government of India will share nur view. As regards Tamb (paragraph 10) as you will see,ysu^est4® to the Foreign Office a redraft of this paragraph of the despatch. We are sending you a separate express letter by to-day 1 s mail as regards the Duzdap Railway (paragraph 11). ^'he question of claims (paragraph 12) is dealt with below under Article XIII of the draft Treaty. 6. I now turn to points arising out of the draft Treaty which may be thought to call for special consideration: (a) Preamble and Article I. Please see on this the demi official letter from the Foreign Office, No.E.4444/4444/34, dated 18th September 1933, of which copies were sent by the air mail of 23rd September. At the moment we are rather disposed to think that it would be preferable to substitute for the words n les Indes' in the fifth line from the end of the Preamble, the words 'I’lnde”, and, in the last paragraph of Article I, to amend the revised draft enclosed in the Foreign Office letter of 23rd September by the omission of the words n ou suzerainete'. The Indian States will be sufficiently covered by the comprehensive phrase 'I’lnde”. I will telegraph further on this point when the matter has been rtin va /- 6 - more closely considered, but subject to such further consideration and to any comment by the Government of India we would propose to accept the Foreign Office redraft. (b) As regards the Annex to Article I . please see paragraph 5 of the draft to the Foreign Office enclosed. Article III . This Article is of interest primarily to the Admiralty. It is, of course, proposed that we should put forward the text now suggested only after one more effort has been made to secure acceptance of 'simple notification'. There is however one small point. I gather that there is some possibility that, if conditions seem favourable for this, a Bill for the establishment of an Indian Navy may be introduced in the Indian Legislature in the fairly near future; and that if such a Bill were to be passed the title of the Royal Indian Marine would be altered to Indian Navy. For the moment, however, it seems clear that we must continue to refer to it as the Royal Indian Marine. If the Treaty negotiations drag, it will, if necessary, be possible to send supplementary instructions to Hoare on this point. Do you agree? (d) Article III bis . We await your views on the Foreigi Office proposals regarding this Article - see our/(1) As - 7 - our express letter of 15th September 1933, No.P.Z.5886/32. (o) Article IV. Henjam . See paragraph 1 above and paragraph 2 of the Foreign Office letter of 5th October enclosed. (f) No question arises on Article V. which is as accepted in India Office letter to Foreign Office, P.Z.2154/32 of 25th April 1932 (copy to the Government of India by the mail of 28th April 1932). (g) Article VI as it stands is as previously agreed* If we abandon the Hen jam Protocol the future of the Henjam wireless can best be dealt with as suggested in paragraph 9 of the draft instructions to Hoare. (k) Article VII . No question arises on Article VII (Bahrein). (i) As regards Article VIII please see paragraph 7 of the draft to Rendel now enclosed. (j) Article IX . Lighting and bouving . As you will see, we are proposing to suggest to the Foreign Office, for the reasons set out in the draft enclosed, a brief reference to this in the Treaty. (k) Article X . Slavery . We Foreign Office an omission in Article I of the Protocol (see paragraph 12 of the draft to Rendel).- 8 - (l) Article XI . Duzdar Railway . See our express letter of today’s date. (m) Article XII . Deb t. We have now secured repayment of our pre-War debt. There has never been much prospect of securing any payment from Persia in respect of the War and post-War non-interest bearing debt. We have informed the Persians that in return £*or a satisfactory Treaty settlement we are prepared to remit £1,000,000 of the oustanding balance of £1,510,000, but we have not committed ourselves as regards the odd £510,000. The Government of India and the Secretary of State were in the past prepared, as were the Treasury, to agree that the Persians should be informed at an appropriate juncture, that we were ready to remit the balance if, as a result, we could obtain a satisfactory Treaty settlement. The Foreign Office are very anxious to give the Minister as full a discretion as possible and it is conceivable that it may be desired to give him authority to make use of this further concession, especially since, as you will see from paragraph 14 of the draft instructions, he will not have too muon to negotiate with, so many of our concessions having been given away in advance. Perhaps the/the Government of India could telegraph whether they would agree, assuming that the Treasury also agree, to giving Hoare an immediate discretion on this point. Article XiII. Claims. The position in regard to this Article is set out in the Appendix to the draft instructions. Would you in this connection please refer to ijiy air mail letter of 2nd September 1932, No.P.Z.4732/32, to the Government of India, and to the Government of India's telegram of 28th September 1932, No.2160? Consequent on that teiegram we had further demi-official correspondence with the Treasury and the Foreign Office. The general effect of the correspondence was to show that there was apparently no record of any Persian claim against an Indian which would not be cancelled by paragraph 1 of the draft Article if this were -accepted by the Persians, but that there was apparently one snail claim by an Indiam ('the comparatively unimportant exception' mentioned in Metcalfe's demi official letter of 19th May 1932, No.F.19-N/32), being a claim dating from 1905 in respect of the confiscation of certain assafoetida. The Foreign Office, as you will see from their demi official of 20th January 1933, No.E.240/240/34, of which- 10 - copies were sent by the sea mail of 26th January, still thought that 'it would be preferable, if and when there is a reasonable prospect of resuming the Treaty negotiations, that the G-overnnent of India should be requested to assume a contingent responsibility for any such claims (i.e* Persian claims against the Government of India or against a British Indian subject which would not be cancelled by paragraph 1 of t&amp;e draft) as may hereafter be discovered, for its seems unreasonable that such a responsibility, however, remote, should be borne by His Majesty's Goverrment'. The Treasury, in their demi official of 20th January 1933, No.S.34672/3 (copy by sea mail of 26th January) pointed out that 'even in the case of a claim hy an Indian against a Persian the question of costs might arise. If His Majesty’s Government were put to expense on this account we should expect to be reimbursed by the Government of India.' The risk of any claim by Persians seems in the circumstances described above, negligible. As for claims by Indians the only one which we have been able to trace is that mentioned earlier in this paragraph. In these circumstances it seems unlikely that the Government of India would involve themselves in any substantial financial risk by accepting an/- 11 - an understanding such as the Foreign Office and the Treasury suggest, and I should be grateful if you could let us know whether they would be prepared to agree to it. The present text of the draft Article is as shown in the appendix to the Foreign Office demi official of 5th October. Could you also say whether you concur in the present text of paragraph 3 of Article XIII? (°) Articles XIV, XY and .X VT of the Treaty raise no fresh point. 7. While we should of course welcome any comment which the Government of India may care to offer on the draft Treaty, the only points on which we have felt unable finally to commit ourselves pending an expression of their views are those referred to in paragraph 6(a), (d), (1), (m) and (n) above, on which we should be grateful if you could telegraph as early as possible. Perhaps you would also let us know whether you agree as regards the point referred to In paragraph 6(c), Vnnrs P’noftJNsfy, (W.) J. 0. WALTO*.Telephone No.: Victoria 1234. In reply please quote Regd.

This is in reply to your letter of 12th January (P.Z.5893/32 ) addressed to Trickett, on the subject of the Claims Article in the Persian Treaty. I take it that even in the case of a claim by an Indian against a Persian, the question of costs might arise. If His Majesty's Government were put to expense on this account, we should expect to be re imbursed by the Government of India. I suggest that your reply should cover this point. Yours sincerely. f ENCLOSURE IN WEEKIY IFTTfR Ko 4 26 JAM, Uii FROM SECRETARY, PCUiu u SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFIOE J.G.

Rendel is dealing exclusively with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company business at the moment, so I am replying. 2. We are sorry to have delayed so long in answer ing your previous letter of October 20th on the same subject, but the Henjam and Anglo-Persian Oil Company crises have, as you know, tended to relegate the more detailed and less immediate treaty questions to the back ground . 3. We have gone through our archives here without finding any Persian claim against the Government of India or against a British Indian subject which would not be cancelled by paragraph 1 of the draft Article as it now stands.

In view of the present gloomy outlook for the general treaty, I need not discuss in detail the point which you raise in the last paragraph of your letter of October 20th regarding paragraph 2 of the draft Article. But I may as well state that we agree in general with your criticism of the present wording, and think that it would probably be as well, when the draft comes to be considered again, to add a new paragraph to the draft Treaty Article (13) on the following lines '(Article 13, paragraph 3).

Pr.2j«7/'* 2 - Please see previous submission on P.Z.2307/32 about the Claims article in the draft Persian treaty. From the Foreign Office letter to the Treasury of 25th June on P.Z.3818/32 it will be seen that the Foreign Office are satisfied that the wording proposed in the draft treaty article would not debar H.M. from pressing for re-payment of the war debt, but that in any case the point is adequately met, since the proposed treaty will deal specifically with the question of the debt in another article. The Treasury are satisfied, and I submit that we, too, may accept the Foreign Office view on this point. I cannothelp feeling, at the same time, that the question of tactics in connection with the proposed redraft requires careful consideration. We have been discussing for nearly four years with the Persians the form of a Claims article and the procedure to be adopted in connection with claims on both sides. We have never got very much farther forward with them, and their latest proposal - which the Foreign Office regard as unsatisfactoiy ~ is merely for an anodyne article engaging both the H.C.P. to go into the matter further at some later X date. If at this stage, without any particular cause shown, we change our tactics and invite the Persians to agree to a mutual cancellation of claims arising out ofthe war, there seems some danger that we may leave them under the impression that we have done so because our ground is weak, and so encourage them to refuse/r refuse to agree to any such arrangement. I suggest, therefore, that, in replying to the Foreign Office, we might impress on them the desirability of making as much capital as is possible of the revised draft. 3. Flease now see Mr. Metcalfe 1 s letter of 19th • « May on P.Z. 3300/32. The Indian war claims amount to about £46,000 (as against a total British claim of some £800,000). Out of this amount some £38,000 has been advanced at various times to certain claimants in equal shares by H.H.G. and the Government of India. The net loss to Indian revenues involved in their abandonment would thus be approximately £20,000. The risk that India might have to reimburse claimants in respect of the balance of the amounts claimed by them - say £8,000 - is perhaps small. (Please see paragraph/^ below). In these circumstance if we could secure the mutual cancellation of war claims it would appear to suit India on the whole well. There is little, if any, prospect of securing com pensation direct from Persia in respect of these claims, and a considerable risk that if referred to an arbitral tribunal the case might go against us on the ground that our activities in Persia during the war were entirely indefensible. We should, on the 4 other hand, be free, not only of the specific Persian claims mentioned in Mr. Metcalfe^ letter, but of the risk of having to face further Persian claims which might be easier of manufacture than of disproof ( cp. paragraph 3 of Mr. Warner’s letter of 25th June to Mr. Trickett on P.Z.3813). 4^ We have now to consider ('further claims by claimants in India in the event of our securing acceptance/ a *7 3,Minute Paper.

It will he seen that the Treasury (with whom the Foreign Office agree) have specifically raised this point and are anxious for an assurance that the Government of India will accept full responsibility for claims by or against Indian Nationals.

As regards the war period the only danger appears to be that fresh claims might arise, or that ttte claimj might be presented in respect of the balance of £8,000 due from -Persia. It is, however, extremely unlikely that any fresh claim will be made 11 years after the final temination of the war. As for claims in respect of the £8,000 our answer would no doubt be that we had been unable to secure substantial claims from Persia and could not ourselves assume any further liability in respect of these claims. T I suggest that we might consult the Gcverrment of India on the lines set out above and attach a draft telegram for this purpose together with a draft interim reply to the Foreign Office. :J5a &lt;**-*-£— cu _/ c(. 0 I' O - o-. — A ^ -* V r . . &gt;1 - . — - f 3000 5 31i if?) *1 i&lt;w V. * 3v \ l \^ U \ D04 4000 5.32 in the proposectyknglo-Persian Greneral Treaty. 2. We agree that far the reasons given by you the draft, with the ~amendmentTsuggested in Baxter's letter to Trickett No.S. 3451/1323/34, of 29th July, may be regarded as satisfactory. But the question of the tactics to be adopted in presenting it to the Persians seems one of some importance. If, after the lengthy and infructuous discussi on which has taken place with a view to reaching a comprehensive settlement of outstanding claims (so many of them arising out of the War) we now present the Persians with a revised treaty article, the effect of which is to cancel all War claims on both sides, is there not some danger that they may argue we should not take this course were it not that we felt ourselves on very weak ground as regards the war period and that Persia's advantage might/-^wsxr / might therefore lie in refusing to compromise on that period, and in manufacturing claims which we might find it difficult altogether to disprove? We would suggest in these circumstances for your consideration that the fins true ti ons to be sent to Koare^hould, if you see no objection, emphasise the desirability of making such capital as is possible of the revised draft, not so much because it does in fact represent any material concession, as because of the desirability of preventing the Persians from thinking that it is an admi ssion by us that our position in th^atter is a weak one, 3.

The Indian war claims appear to anount to some £46,000 out of a total of some £800,000; and advances have already been made jointly in respect of them by the Government of India and His Majesty's Government amounting to £38,000.

We have consistently felt -a view 1 think shared by the Foreign Office and Teheran - that having regard to the relatively small importance of these claims, and the fact that they arose out of the war, there wa^little if any chance of securing anything from Persia in respect of them. We have retained them hitherto largely for bargaining purposes, and having regard in particular to the danger of further counter-claims by Persia in respect of the war period, we are of opia-frq^, subject to the views of the Government of India,J^that, L'04 4000 5.32 from the Indian point of view, the balance of advantage definitely rests wi th a general cancellation such as is now contemplated in respect of the war period which would secure us against claims by Persia in respect of that period# 4# The Treasury, as you will have seen from TricketVs letter to me of 2 8th June, No.S.34672/4, of which a copy was sent to you, are anxious to be clear that the Government of Indi a will accept s ole/sole responsibility, in the event of the revised claims article being adopted, in respect of claims by or against British Indians, responsibility in respect of British claimants being borne by His Majesty's Government. -i- engioae e-spy- sm air Tnatil-telefraBt-whrffh we havo ■oen^ on this point to 'the ry i ■h Gore mine nl u f ±nQi a[ which I think is self-explanatory. 5.

Do you agree that in the event of Iru n e ther e being claims against Indi ms L of a nature falling within the scope 904 4000 5.32of the article and other than those excluded hy its first paragraph / India should accept responsibility. Claims falling outside war period would be dealt with by tribunal proposed in Article 2 of Annexe to revised draft claims article. In event of such a claim being found valid, liability^if you accept Treasury suggestion^would fall on Indian revenues alone, but per contra they would bear no liability in respect of cases decided against His Majesty^ Government in the United Kingdom. Answer to claimants in respect of war period would presumably be that we had- been unable to secure acceptance by Persia, and could oiirselves accept no further liability# 3. As the result of further discussion here between the interested departments it has been decided to amend the second paragraph of Article 5 of the Annex to the draft Treaty Article. The text of Article 5 of the Annex with the amended second paragraph would be as follows:- Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees to regard the awards of the arbitral tribunal as final and to give full and immediate effect thereto. . * All sums of money awarded by the/Department. the tribunal on account of any claim shall be paid to the Government of the High Contracting Party by whom the claim is made on a date to be agreed upon by the High Contracting Parties, or in default of any such agree ment on the day which follows the expiry of twelve months from the date of the con clusion of the final session of the tribunal. If sums are payable under the awards of the tribunal by the Govern ments of both High Contract ing Parties, the said payments shall be made by both Governments on the same date and at the same time. They farther agree L that all claims which might have been presented under Article 1 of this Annex and have not been so presented shall be considered as absolutely and irrevocably settled for the future. The object of the re draft of the second para graph is to provide against the possibility of Persia refusing to meet claims givengiven against her and the danger that in this event we might find outselves paying out to Persia in respect of claims given against us without receiving from her.

(E.1323/1323/34) and our diacussion yesterday, regarding your proposal to have a Treaty provision dealing with British claims against the Persian Government and Persian claims against H.M. Government, I understand that in due course you will he calling a conference at which representa tives of the Departments concerned will have the opportunity of considering the proposal in detail, hut that meantime you would like a provisional expression of our views. Substantially we agree with your proposal, ana are disposed to accept the view that it would he useless to attempt to deal with claims for damage to persons and property during the War period, which it is suggested may he defined as 4th August 1914 - 22nd Pehruary 1931. Whilst expressing that view however, v/e have no information as to the particular claims which would thus he excluded, nor indeed as to the balance which would he admissible before the Tribunal. Whilst we agree that contractual claims, whether arising during the War period or arising before or after it, should he eligible for trial and avrard, we should like to consider whether the double negative in your araft Article 13, \ as well as inits Prench counterpart, will be sufficiently clear as to preclude dispute even by a Persian. We feel some doubttoo whether our own Yar debt would indisputably be left free from the veto on pressing claims. At any rate it might be w'orth considering whether we should not preserve explicitly H.M. Government debts in this Article, unless indeed it is to be specifically dealt with in another part of the Treaty. Prom the practical point of view, the main consideration depends on thb number and character of the claims; and as to this, I understand that you feel sure that the balance would turn out to be almost entirely in our favour. A point may arise here, affecting India. There may not improbably be some claims by or against Indians, and in these cases the Government of India should accept responsibility, reimbursing us anything we may have to pay and generally looking after their own people in the presentation oi their claims and in the disposal of the cases.

If this is the case, the answer to the question whether it is worth our while to abandon our claims depends largely on the amount and value of the Persian claims against the Government of India for acts done by British military authorities in Persia during the war. The only claims of this kind^ which to our knowledge have so far been represented^ f\ dated the 27th June 1929^) with one comparatively unimportant exception. It Is of course possible that these claims are«The Reutan LaleEar claim; a claim by two Parsee traders of Kerman against Sir Percy Sykes (vide enclosure to Despatch No. 456 of August 25th 1931 from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs); The ’Kara Deni z H or M Ha^iadain ,, claim ( vide correspondence sent to the GoYemment of India with Political Secretary’s letter No. 16, dated 18th Apri 1 1 929 ). HisMajesty*s Government and the Minister, Tehran, are no doubt in a better position than the Government of India to form an estimate of the amount of the valid Persian claims either already or likely to be presented, but I am to request that the Government of India’s point of view may not be overlooked #ien the draft claims article to be presented to the Persian Government is under consideration.

It will be remembered that Brigadier General Sir Percy Sykes on re-establishing the Kermar^Consulate in 1916 fined a number of Kermanis for having dealings with German agents. Amongst the former were two lead ing Parsi traders, Surushian and Kayanian, who were fined heavily for buying from M.Bruggmann a quantity of yarn, etc. the property of the Oriental Carpet Manu facturers Ltd. It is learnt from a confidential source that these two traders have now forwarded notices through the Adlieh Court to Sir P. Sykes end the Petag Co. trading in the North of Persia. M. Bruggmann had sold the yarn to the above traders on behalf of the Petag Co. which he then represented in Kerman. It is said that the notice on Sir P. Sykes will be served through the Persian Legation in London. The amount of damages claimed is stated to be more than ten times the actual fine paid. It may be mentioned that as the result of the transaction referred to above the two Parsi claimant firms were placed on the Black List. 0 pz 4)3*?If ,^-y ^OREXGH OFFICE, S.W.l.

FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET SEPT, INDIA OPPIOEget their claims finally settled# We had already for some time 'been considering the sort of treaty provision that we should like to see in cluded in the draft treaty, and I now enclose, for your observations, the draft of a treaty article of two paragraphs, together with an annex of ten articles. You will see that the outstanding features of our proposals are the following:- (a) We think that it is quite useless to expect that Persia will ever willingly agree to pay the claims of British subjects arising out of the events of the War. As you know, Persia was unable to defend her neutrality during the War, and was over—run and occupied by the forces of the belligerent powers. She is unlikely, therefore, to agree to accept responsibility for what happened during the War to British subjects or companies and their property on Persian soil. On the other hand, various claims (such as the Reuben Lalezar claim) might be brought by Persian subjects against His Majesty 1 s _Majesty^ Government on account of the acts of British military authorities in Persia during the War. It seems, therefore, 'best from every point of view that we should recognise the exceptional circumstances obtaining during the War, and agree not to pursue claims which are directly due to those circumstances, and which arose out of acts done or events taking place during the War. (b) We have taken the date February 22nd, 1921 as the end of the War period, because that is approximately the date when the last British troops left Persia and, more especially, because it is the cate of the coup d*Stat which led eventually to the establishment of the present regime in Persia. (c) At the same time, we think it necessary to exclude ’’contractual obligations” from any general waiver of war claims. Our object is to al low the claims of the Persian Railways Syndicate, Limited, arising out of a contract signed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1920, to come before the proposed claims tribunal. It shouldshould he noted, moreover, that inter-Govem- mental loans and advances are of a contractual character, and that the phrase ’’contractual obligations” would probably thus suffice to ensure that this claims article did not cover the cancellation of the Persian Government’s war debt to His Majesty’s Government and the \ Government of India; but in any case the Persian debt is to be dealt with in a separate article of the Treaty. (d) We propose also to provide that the claims tribunal is only to deal with claims which have already been formally presented before a certain date. We must, of course, try to prevent the Persian Government from putting in a lot of new claims which have never been presented before. The claims to be submitted to the Tribunal will again be formally notified within six months of the entry into force of the Treaty (which will give us time enough to examine our own claims in full detail and weed out such asare found to te legally unsound) British claimants would he informed in due course that our expenses of arbitration before the proposed claims tribunal will be met by a deduction from awards# We shall be glad to hear if you have any observations on the enclosed draft.

We eoneur in FemarX as to necessity for the exemption of the 1 j ghthouse_a-t-aff at Tamb from Persian customs dues and vise in-the event of Island being leased to Persia, A separate communication will follow in regard to Duzdap railway./ J IITDIA OFFICE, \miTEHALL, S.W.l. 9th October, 1933* My dear George, Many thanlis for your letter of the 5th October, No.E.5913/1329/34, enclosing the provisional draft of the general treaty instructions to be given to Hoare. Broadly speaking, the draft seems to us to be excellent, and subject to the points dealt with below, and to any comment which the Government of India may have to moke on the Du&amp;dap Railway (as to which Walton is writing to you separately) and on the terms of the Preamble, and Articles! and III bis, we do not think that the Secretary of State is likely to see any ©ejection to it. As regards consultation with the Government o± India we appreciate your anxiety for an immediate decision^ and it is, of course, the case, that save on a very few points the draft treaty in the stage which it has now reached is essentially based on consultation with uhem and has their concurrence. But while generally speaking we/ G.Y/. Rendel, Esq., G.M.G., FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. P.Z.6392/33. Secret and Immediate.2 we should feel able to recommend acceptance of the draft (with the modifications suggested below) without further reference to them, we think it desirable to give them an opportunity to comment. We have therefore sent them a copy of your draft by this week’s air mail, under the letter of which I enclose a copy and will follow” it up with a telegram with a view to reducing delay to a minimum. 2. I deal firstly with the draft despatch, in which we would recommend concurrence subject to the following comments. Para.b. We understand that in referring to possible difficulties in connection with the issue of the Exequatur, you have in mind the risk that the Persians might refuse their Exequatur to our Consul- G-eneral at Bushire without giving any specific reason, (which under international practice they not be required to give) but in fact on the ground, as they would probably admit in unofficial discussions, that he also held what amounted to an administrative post (as Resident). Walton’s letter of the 14th September, P.Z.5469/33, suggested that a treaty article providing for the retention of the Residency at Bushire might be dispensed/(g)©&gt; 4. words n ou suzerainetS' should he omitted in the last paragraph of Article I. These, however, are relatively minor points. 5. I may perhaps put on record (in connection with our recent discussion about Kov/eit) that the risk that the terms of Article I and the Notes to be attached thereto might preclude us from establishing a protectorate over one of the States named should we later desire to do so, was discussed in 1930 in connection with various drafts then under consideration, all of which involved an undertaking by both parties ,T respecter 1’integrity territorials et 1'independence dc 1'autre H.P.C. TI , and which covered the Gulf States (cp: Foreign Office letter of 17th April 1930, E.1896/143/34; Walton’s letter to you of 12th December, 1930 No.P.Z.6916/30; and Warner’s letter of 29th December, 1930 E.6762/143/34)* The Foreign Office appear to have been satisfied that no risk was involved, and we assume that they remain of tnis opinion. The point was also discussed in connection with Article VTI of the draft Treaty in Foreign Office letter E.2632/1453/34 of 15th June 1932. 6* Para.7. As you know, we have referred Article III bis to the Government of India. Para. 10. We have always regarded it as essential to/ 7 .5 to secure a formal recognition in the Treaty of the status of Tamb, and of Abu Musa, in the terms of the present draft Article VIII. If the Persians wish to couple their recognition of the Jowasimi ownership of Tamb with a lease of the Island on the Sheikh’s conditions we should see no objection ? so long as the Sheikh’s conditions were met, and the point about the lighthouse to which reference is made in Lascelles’ memorandum was covered. But we are not anxious to encourage them to do so and the draft as it stands tends to go farther than we should like. We should therefore like to propose the following redraft:- ’’The position as regards Article VIII, Tamb, Abut Musa and Sirri, is still as described in the relevant part of the Memorandum. Formal recognition by Persia in the Treaty of the Jowasimi ownership of Tamp and Abu Musa is one of the .essential desiderata of His Majesty’s Government. If, however, the Persian Government should desire to revive the question of leasing Tamb, subsequent to their recognition of its status, from the Sheikh of Ras-al-IChaimah, His Majesty’s Government while not anxious to encourage the Persian Government to adopt this course, would in such circumstances see no objection to it, subject to acceptance by the Persian Government of the conditions laid down by the/the Sheikh and to a special provision of the nature referred to in paragraph 4 on page 30 of the Memorandum in connection with the maintenance of the lighthouse. They consider, however, that it should be left to the Persian Government to raise this question. n 8. Para,11* Walton is writing separately to you about the Du&amp;dap Railway. 9. Para.14. Page 12. This paragraph makes no reference to one important additional concession, vis.^the abandonment of the balance of the War and post-War debt. As you know there has been discussion in the past as to whether the Minister should be authorised to offer this concession, subject to the concurrence of the Government of India and of the Treasury. It is for consideration whether it might not now be possible to give Sir R. Hoare discretion in regard to it in return for a satisfactory settlement on the other points in issue. 10. I now turn to the individual Articles of the Treaty, the position in regard to v/hich is set out in the Appendix to the despatch. The Preamble and Articles I, Illbis IV, VIII, XI, and XII are covered by the remarks above. We have no comment on Articles XT,f 7, V, VI, VTI, ex-Art. XIV, XV, or XVI, and assume that tho Admiralty will examine Article III, which, so far as we can judge, is the best we can do if Hoare finds it impossible to persuade the Persians to agree to simple notification. But please see in connection with this article the reference in paragraph 6(c) of Walton’s letter of 7th October to Fraser Tytler to the possibility that the ’R.I.M.' may become the’Indian Navy.’ 11. Ex-Article IX. Vfould you see any objection (we do not press the suggestion) to restoring a reference t in the Draft Treaty to lighting and buoying, perhaps in the shape of a two-line Article to the general effect that the H.G. parties will deal with lighting and buoying by means of a separate agreement. The inserting of some reference in the Treaty might make it easier to obtain the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board project, or if this fails, or we decide for any reason to let it drop, make it easier to press the Persians at a later stage to agree to coordination of lighting and buoying arrangements in the Gulf. And it is conceivable that the discussion which a draft artiple in these terms would produce with Feroughi might give Hoare an opportunity to ascertain on what line their minds were now moving, in the light of the information * they will by now have received from the French lighting and buoying expert. 12./12. Article X, Slavery. It is parhaps rather late in the day to make any alteration, but we should like to make one suggestion which appears to be really only a matter of drafting viz. the omission in Article I of the Protocol of the words u de 1 T esclavage”. The Convention of 1882 deals with the traffic in slaves: The words referred to do not appear in the draft Treaty Article or the Preamble to the Protocol, both of which merely refer to n la traite des esclaves'; the whole protocol only deals with the Slave trade on the waters of the Gulf (including territorial waters) and the words u de I'esclavage 11 in Article 1 accordingly seem superfluous, while thereis perhaps the danger that their insertion might give the Persians an excuse for claiming an interest in anti-slavery measures in the territories of the Sheikhs on the Arab Coast, which might prove embarrassing. 13* Article XIII. As you will see from the letter to Fraser-Tytler enclosed, we have asked the Government of India whether they concur in this Article in its present form, and are prepared to give the undertaking which the Foreign Office and Treasury desire. 14. X am sending copies of this letter to Hoore, Grieve Parkinson, Harris, Toovey, and Bowyer. J. Q. LAITHWAJTE.COPY OF Air Mail , % ti- P.Z.6392/33 ' /j^y' iC-v^u-s' INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.t.l 7th October, 1933. I enclose a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office covering a provisional draft of instructions to be given to Hoare as regards the resumption of the Treaty negotiations with Persia, together with a very valuable appendix showing ’the position in July of this year on the various Articles of the draft Treaty. We have not yet been able to take instructions here on the provisional draft, but I enclose copy of a draft reply to the Foreign Office which we are submitting for approvalhich is, I think, self-explanatory. The future of Henjam, about which I wrote to you in my air mail letter of 22nd September, No.P.Z.6051/33, is for discussion in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial defence on Tuesday, 10th October, and the result of that discussion may be to necessitate a further alteration of the instructions. But in view of the urgency of the matter (as Hoare is due to leave on the llth October) I think it well to send you these papers Major W.K.Fraser-Tytler, C.M.G.,M.C., foreign Secretary to the Government of India oreign and Political Department, NEW DELHI. at/- 2 - at once and will follow up this letter with a telegram when we have been able to take orders here. 2. The Government of India have of course been throughout kept in close touch with all developments in connection with the Treaty, and the instructions on which Clive and Koare have in the past conducted their negotiations with the Persians were based so far as/were directly concerned on discussion with the Government of India and the India Office. A number of the Articles in u^e draft Treaty in these circumstances call for no comment. On certain others (such as the Bushire Residency) we have felt sufficiently sure of the view of the Government of India to feel justified in expressing agreement to the Foreign Office without waiting for your formal concurrence. But there are one or two points on which there have been recent developments as a result of which v.e should be grateful if the Government of India would indicate their view. 3. The general line of the draft despatch to Koare is, I think, satisfactory so far as we are concerned. Such criticisms as we have on it are contained in the draft to Rendel now enclosed. As I have mentioned above, the reference to Henjam (paragraph 3) must for the moment be provisional/</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00000a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3456</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00000a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3456</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/51 ‘Persia.
