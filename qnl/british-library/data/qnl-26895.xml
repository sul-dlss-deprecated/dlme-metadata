Donaldson. Sir Oyril Pox said today that there is no doubt that the Sultans writ runs up to the northern base of the Qarce mountains. He is under the impression that it runs very much '''X further but did mention that there appears to be considerable ill-feeling between the Sultan and Ibn Saud over the question of the control of the tribes in this area.

The statement given to the Government of India in India Office letter No. P. Z. 36 U5/55 of 29th Ju ne 1933 that His Majesty*s Government agreed that the claim * of the Sultan of Muscat that Ras Dharbat Ali was the boundary of his territory might be admitted was based upon information given to me personally by the then Sultan of Qishn and Socotra when I visited Socotra at about that time. The people of the Sultan*s mainland territory of Qishn are Mahras, and he explained to me that many Mahras also live to the east of Ras Dharbat Ali, but that he nevertheless did not claim any sovereignty beyond that point. I was rather surprised by this, but the Sultan observed: 'I understand that many English people live in the south of France, but that the British Government nevertheless does not claim that territory.' The Sultan was unable to tell me how the /boundary E. P. DONALDSON, ESQ., C. M. G.nd boundary ran inland from Has Dharbat An.

I enclose a tracing from one of Bertram Thomas* maps, on which the Sultan has marked what he considers to be the western boundary of Dhofar. The Sultan says that this boundary follows natural features, is not disputed and was the subject of a letter forwarded to the Political Agent, Muscat, by trie Sultan* s father in 1929. I will endeavour to trace, and forward to you, a copy of this letter on ny return to Muscat. 3. The Sultan states that the Mahra country is all to the west of this boundary and that the Mahras have no tribal rights or land in Dhofar though they are occasion ally to be met in the province. 4. When Altounyan visited the Sultan in January, he apparently promised the Sultan that the Petroleum Concessions Limited would send a party of geologists to explore Dhofar in October xi this year. The Sultan is confident that he can make adequate arrangements for their protection in most parts of the province but that provided he is told of the places they wish to visit before they gCo&gt; he will indicate to them whether or not his protection will be effective. 5. Sir Cyril Fox’s verbal report has so encouraged the Sultan that if the Petroleum Concessions Limited do not start serious exploration in this area soon, he will certainly assume that it is because they have no real desire to develop their concession.

I thought Bertram Thomas the best authority I could consult on the subject so I wrote to him and I now enclose a copy of his reply. This shows that the Mahra extend right across the hinterland of the Dhofar Province and even some way to the eastward but does not assist us very much in deciding where the Sultan*s jurisdiction ends and that of the Aden Government begins, which is the main point at issue when we are dealing with oil exploration and the question of responsibility for the security of the personnel employed in it. 2. No map in my possession shows any boundary between the Sultan* s and the Aden Protectorate and I should be interested to learn whether any attempt has ever been made to define it in writing or even to indicate the point on the coast where the two jurisdictions are supposed to meet. 3 I am sending copies of this letter to Stewart and the Government of Aden E.

The Mahra are not confined to the Aden Protectorate, at least elements of the Mahra tribe range freely in the steppe in the hinterland of the Dhofar Province as far west as 56° 20 ,, and there are small settled elements in the mountains. The following extract from a published work of mine in the Proceedings of the British Academy, Vol. xxiii may help. (Incidentally their tongue, which I have written a short grammar of, vide above, is, according to A1 Idnsi (circa AD. 1100) a survival of Himyaritic . Quote : f, The Mahra, who number many thousand men, extend from Ras Nus and Jabal Zaulaul westwards through the borderland of steppe and mountain to Wadi Rama, coming down to the coast at Jadhib and beyond. Although speaking the tongue Mahri throughout, east and west wings of the tribe spring'from two distinct ancestors, and today there is no paramount shaikh of the Mahra with undisputed lineal title as is the case with many tribes. Each section has its customary headman, though one of these, by name Bir Afrair (Bir = (Ar.) Bin, in the Hadara tongues), has a unique prestige and exacts tribute from all except nomadic elements. The eastern ¥ wing of the Mahra - Beduin mostly, who in the harvest season become frankincense pickers - claims descent _ from one Bir Boki, and this branch is known as Hasarit. The western Mahra are largely settled, the coastal elements are often fishermen, and a few merchants and sailors are to be found among them.' 2. As regards boundaries you will find a short historical sketch of Dhofar on pp. 10 seq. of my 'Arabia Felix'. The somewhat fortuitous way Dhofar came into the Muscat Sultan 1 s hands 70 years or so ago probably means that the Western boundary was always ill-defined, if indeed it was defined at all. Before the. arrival on the scene of European oil concessionaries, dotted lines on maps had, as you know, little interest for Arab rulers who thought in terms of revenue-producing-ports, or the habitats (especially water-holes; of beduin tribes owing them allegiance. The Mahra tribe is scarcely a political entity but the beduin elements in the Eastern ranges in the Sultan of Muscat's territory of Dhofar do not, so far as I know, owe allegiance as do their settled elements in the West to the Aden Government. I remember exploring the Southern coast with the late Sultan of Muscat in our state-ship 'A1 Sa'id' as far West as what we then considered the boundary, but I cannot for the life of me remember the name of the point though I have got an idea it was to the W r est of Rakhiyut. I must have a note-book and sketch map somewhere in my belongings either in Tangier or in storage in London, and if I get a chance of getting access to them sometime I will remember to send you along a note of anything of relevant interest.

Acting Resident etc. His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies# London.NOTE ON THE EASTERN BOUNDARY OP THE ADEN PROTECTORATE, On May 21st I left Aden By air for Qishn with the object of gathering further information about the eastern boundary# The principal object of the flight was to enable the Royal Air Force to check stocks of petrol at Marbat in the Dhufar province of Oman, at Reida, and at Mukalla, and as the aircraft proceeded to Marbet the first day I took the opportunity of making enquiries there about the boundary. The information I was given was obtained from Sheikh •Ali bin Salim Albusa’idi, the wall, and Sheikh f Ali bin Muhammad al Qari, the resident representative of the Qara Sheikh in Marbat. It appears that Darbat *Ali itself is considere , in Marbat at any rate, as being in Omani territory. My interpreter was informed in a conversation he had with some of the locals that it originally belonged to Qishn but that a Sultan of Muscat had bombarded and captured the place and 'made some mark on it'. Prom Darbat f Ali inland the boundary is said to run as follows: From Darbat ’Ali to Arkhiyut 1 hour w Arkhiyut to Al Hauta 3 hours Al Hauta to Wadi al Hana • • 1 hour w Wali al Haim to Fiza • • 2 hours ' Fiza to ’Aful 2 hours , Afui to Maghsil 1 hour u Maghsil to Fadkhut 1 hour. Between Darbat f Ali and Jadib which belongs to Qishn is said to be a big wadi called Kheisat Baqar between two mountains. In connection with the apparently new suggestion that Darbat f Ali belongs to Muscat attention may be ! \drawn to statements on page 392 ofthe Red Sea Pilot, / 193^ edition, where it is said that Daraqut 'marks the eastern limit of the territory of the Mahra tribe'’ and 'Has Darbat *Ali is the western limit of the territory I of the Garra tribe”* Note I. Attention may also be drawn to Colonel Miles’ statement on page 519 of 'Countries and Tribes of the Persian Gulf'. He says, 'At Has Shajr the dominions of the Sultan of I uscat terminate, and here also is the dividing line between the Mahras and the Garras, although, in fact, the Garras clain and partly occupy the land as far west as the village of Rakyoot twelve miles distant'* Mrs Bent says on page 278 of 'Southern Arabia' that 'Rakhiout' is the end of Omani influence and that there is a small fort there as a protection against the Mahras* The first at any rate of these statements is clearly incorrect as Jadib 'Red Sea Pilot 'Jodab') and Hauf are certainly Mahra. In any case it has been agreed that the boundary is Ras Darbat f Ali, though I do not think It is determined to which side the Ras actually belongs* At :,ishn the information I gained from Sultan Ahmed served to correct and confirm that which I had previously gained in Seihut and that which Captain Hickinbotham had obtained in Qishn a short time ago* The position of Jebel Jadib is obviously much nearer the shore than I had previously supposed and its location is probably just behind the little coastal village of Jadib. Sultan Humeid, the representative of the Sultan of Socotra in Qishn, told me that it was half a day’s journey from the shore and six hours from Ras Darbat ’All*3. In JadiTs itself live the Bin Yasix* section wiiich is the rauqaddan of Bin Rafit. Some of them also live in Johel Jadih. There, too, are the Bin Afrid and the big section of the Bin # Ali Maqaddaou After the Bin 'Ali uqaddam are the Bin Towar whose eastern boundary is the Wadi Hana, the Bin ’Ainr Jid mid Bin Naji, the Bin t Aaab &gt; and the Bin Fansuhh living in the V/adi Uahrut* The last section on the Unseat Aden border isthe Bin Eabnot living in the Wadi ahalhamit* The Wadis llahmt and Shalhamit ■‘empty' into the Wadi Jeisa which 'flows” Into the sea at Oheida. I put 'empty” and 'flows” in inverted com ias lest I should give the Impression that the land about the duscat-Aden border is a fertile country liberally supplied with running rivers* it is in fact very up. ch the x'e verse* It was not possible to obtain any real idea of the depth of penetration in land, though I was informed that the Mahra tribes do not dwell beyond the mountains (steppe) 2 though they travel and raid in the desert* Note 2* The best information available seems to be a note on page lh2 of Mr* Thomas ' Arabia Felix” * He says that 4 he tribal distribution is as follows: The Umra al Hait system is the habitat mainly of two tribes, Mahra and Bait Kathir; they also extend to the west. Nominally the lower wadi reaches of Dauka, Ghudan, Aidam and Hat belong to Bait Kathir, though the Mahra use them freely; the upper sources of the wadis (except Ghudan) are largely in Mahra hands, particularly Habarut, Ghazal, Ingudan and ihahibum, as well as the individual wadis immediately to thetiie west, scattered about midst the I, ahra and Bait Kathir are a numb r ol snail Hadara tribeBf non—Arab survivals. Thus to the westward of Hat in its lower courses is found the Bilhaf, a rather nondescript tribe owing allegiance to no fac:ion* but Mahri in speech. A distinguishing featu e of their dress is that they carry a knife# not a dagger# in Uaeir belts. They neither raid nor are raided, and like the Salub of llejd are accepted as a rabia by all. They are also servants of the Shrine of Jauhari (Uiam al Tabbakh) where the Mahra pay pilgrimages and make sacrifices. At the eastern extremity of the Uram al Halt system Wadi Andhaur la nominally a possession of the Bautahara (Bit Ijhor) though ~he Mahra tribesmen are usually in evidence there. The Bautahara# a now dwindling and declasse tribe most of whom are fishennen# with an exclusive language# were once the reputed possessors of the whole eastern steppe from v/adi Ghudaun (of the Kathir) to Wadi Qadun(?) (of the arasis), while the western steppe is reputed to have belonged to the now legendary Bin Dhurbut. Elements of another small tribe# ’Afar, live in Habarut with the Mahra and the equally obscure Bait ash Shaikh (Bit Istait or sometime Insakht), and thought to be collateral with the dhahara, occupy Wadi Ingudan near the water-hole of Hanun. To the westwards of the Urarn al Hait system the Mahra tribe extends to Wadi Rama# thence Manshil to Wadi al Jauf: ’Awamir succeed as far as Wadi Khadhra, whence commences the Sa’ar habitat. A, a point about ten miles eastward of Daraqut the flat sandy plain in which Gheida lies is abruptly terminated by a steep and remarkable straight wall of mountain which runs down to the sea at an angle of about 1+5 Jegrees (FALIK). Damqut itself appears as a snail village/' V v 5. village on a tiny patch of sand in the corner of precipitous and very high cliffs* A wadi comes down with a very twisting course a little east of the village and circling the village enters the sea to its west. A little further beyond Damqut is Jadib f much smaller but in much the same situation. The country is generally mountainous» black and forbidding from the sea* but unusually sprinkled with vegetation on the plateau above* which is much inter sected and broken up with wadis. This mountainous country with practically speaking no shore is backed by higher ranges (J*!^AMK) in the distance. The high rocky cliffs continue until the promontory (5AS HISU':) marking the westerm limit of Dhufar Bay* I was unable to recognise from above which wadi was theTadi Hana.Copy.

Ships to Protectorate ports do much to keep contact with outlying Chiefs and Triber and to cement toe bonds of friendship between toe two races, and the hospitality and kindness which is invariably extended to toe local inhabitants by the Captain and his Officers is always much appreciated. I have addressed a letter ofof thanks to Cotonander Bevan. I have, etc. (SGD.) i.C. LAKE Acting Resident, etc. His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, London./] f The Residency, Aden, 26th April 1935. From Captain T. Hickinbotham, Civil Secretary, Aden, To Lieutenant-Colonel ; . C. Lake, Acting Chief Commissioner, Aden. Sir, I have the honourlto state that in accordance with instructions, I left Aden at 9 a.m. on the 1st of April 1935 in H.M.S. M Penzance M , Commander R.H. Be van, R.N. , in Command. 2. We arrived at Abd-el-Kuri Island on the 3rd of April. Commander Bevan and myself landed and interviewed the local people who stated that they had water and that there was no sickness in the Island. They also stated that no other ship had visited the Island since H.M.S. 'Penzance* b m visit two years previously. A quantity of cigarettes and matches were handed over to the Islanders, and in addition Commander Bevan very kindly gave two cases of ship’s biscuits which were very much appreciated. 3. Socotra was readied on the 4th of April and h . .S. 'Penzance” anchored at Hadibo. I inter viewed the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra on two occasions: once when he called on the ship and once when I returned his call. On each occasion Salim bin Abdullah, Abdullah bin Ahmed, Abdullah bin Salim, and Ahmed bin Abubakr were present. The Sultan was very reticent and did not seem able to give very much information with regard to the eastern boundaryof the Protectorate. It is possible that he was suspicious of questioning and was not anxious to give a direct answer. 1 informed him of the relin quishing of Renjara and the establishment of a station at Bahrein. I discussed the question of Seihut with him and referred to the obstruction that i/jt. Ingrams had found to his onward Journey when touring the Hadhramaut. The Sultan stated that he had heard that Mr. Ingrams had been touring but that he had no knowledge of any resistance having been offered to him within the Qishn boundary. I gathered that the Sultan considered that he had complete control up to the western boundary of his State and that the neighbouring people round Seihut and the town itself were not rebellious to his authority. He proposed to make enquiries as soon as possible with regard to Mr. Ingrams* incident and I feel that any suggestion of handing this area to the Sultan of Mukalla would be badly received. With the excep tion of a request to have his stipend paid annually, the Sultan had no other request to make. 4. In order to overcome the natural suspicion that the backward people most naturally have to foreigners, I suggest that if possible a Political Officer be sent to the Island for at least a month during the next winter. The people in the hills are so unaccustomed to Europeans that they immediately run away at the sight of one, and I do not think that we shall be able to assist these people unless more contact is established between us and them. 5. We arrived at Qishn on 7th April and inter viewed Sultan Khalifa bin Abdullah, the brother of the&amp; the representative of the Sultan of Qlshn and Socotra. Sultan Khalifa stated that his brother was inland as the visit was expected to take place a month earlier. I was particularly struck by the pleasant manner of this man and his apparent wish to assist. During my interview on shore Sultan Khalifa bin Abdullah, Mubarak bin 3a 1 id, an unpleasant and voluble person who was of no assistance in fact rather the reverse, Sa’id bin Issa and Muhammad bin Ahmed were present. I questioned them on the sub ject of the eastern boundary and they were all quite clear, as had been the Sultan of Socotra, that Ras Darbat *Ali was the point on the coast which con stituted the dividing mark between Qishn and Oman. Sultan Khalifa stated that he was speaking from what he had heard and not from what he had actually seen. His subsequent statements were agreed to by Sa’id bin Issa, an old man who had been in the part of the country under discussion. It appears that a Wadi, by name A1 Hanna, enters the sea just east of Ras Darbat ’Ali. This Wadi forms the boundary between Oman and Qishn, and it runs north easterly from the coast. The frontier apparently after following the Wadi turns north-westerly and eventually joins the Wadi A1 Masila. I was unable to discover for how far the frontier follows the Wadi Hanna but I gather for some distance. Sultan Khalifa identified the Bin Afrid and Bin Kadaba as being one and the same tribe and being together with Din ’Ali Muqaddam, Bin Naji, Bin Azale, Bin Khorshed,. Bin Muqfeh, Bin Suleimi end Bin Qidda, subject to the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra. HeHe stated, that the following tribes were met with from Has Darbat ’Ali along the eastern boundary in the order in which they are written here. 1. i in ’Ali MUQaddam, 2. Bin Afrid, 3. Bin Tawar, 4. Bin Naji, 5. Bin As Suheil and then the Manahll. No Mahras are settled in Onan territory but a number who are in employment there are residing there. Without good maps it is nearly impossible to decide the value of any information obtained and whether the questions are being correctly understood, 1 feel that advantage should be taken of the brief visits that these persons make to Aden to cross-examine them on the eastern frontier, I think thrt they are more likely to answer the question truthfully in private then when in the presence of their suspicious tribesmen. Sultan Khalifa confirmed the Sultan’s statement with regard to Seihut, and the Impression that I had received at Socotra that interference with Seihut would not be acceptable was confirmed here. 6. We arrived at Mukalla on the 9th of April and two days were spent there. The Indian adminis tration of this Arab town is naturally not appreciated by the inhabitants, I discussed the question of certificates of Identity and Italian visas with the Sultan’s representative, and all that I achieved was a request from him that the matter be put in writing. I could see no signs of any attempt being made to improve the town and, as far as I could see, there is no system of sanitation^ 7. Balihaf was reached on the 11th of April and Sultan fcuharamad bin Ahmed and Sultan Ahmed Hadi immediately came on board and their call was returned anan hour later, 1 found them very cheerful and extremely pleased that H.M.3, “Penzance 1 * had vieited them. They were the most friendly people that had been met with during the tour, A woman with a very bad foot and her husband and an infant child were brought to Aden by kind permission of Commander Sevan in H.M.S, “Penzance 1 * end it appeared from the doctor’s report that unless the woman was immediately removed to Aden there would be no chance of her life being saved. H.M.S. “Penzance** returned to Aden on the 12th of April. 8. I wish to record how extremely hospitable Commander Sevan was at ell places at which we called. He entertained the Chiefs and representatives in his own cabin, and whenever pressure of work permitted he accompanied me on shore, when an official visit was being returned. At Abd-el-Kuri, a present of biscuits was made to the inhabitants, at q,ishn a small present of fruit was given in return for a present of livestock from the Sultan’s representative, and at Balihaf no less than three tons of water. All were badly in need of water and wo Id have been reduced to a very serious con dition had not this water been forthcoming. By Commander Sevan’s permission Curgeon-Lieutenant J.W.Khys attended to patients at every place at which the ship called and at Socotra he personally attended to over a hundred cases in 2 days. These kind attentions were very much appreciated by the local inhabitants. 9. I have the pleasure to report that the Union Jack was flying both at Socotra and Qiehn on H.M.S. “Penzance’s** arrival.

The Sultan was rather vague about the question, the decision of which, he said, he would leave entirely to me; but there was a general concurrence among his principal advisers that the boundary between his territory and that of the Sultan of Muscat is at Bas Darbat *Ali, in spite of the fact that there are Mahris living in the villages of Kharifut and Bakhyut to the east of this point.

The object they have particularly in view is to avoid any conflict of jurisdiction in the area between Sur in Muscat, and Aden. The matter is, of course, complicated by the fact that the C.O. are now responsible for the Aden Protectorate and the Hadhramaut, while responsibility for Muscat remains, as before, with the G.of I. and the India Office e simplest solution of the difficulty appears to be that the dividing line should be the same as the dividing line between India Office and Colonial Office responsibility, i.e. the southern frontier of Muscat. From Biscoe f s letter to the G.of I. dated 24th February, No.76S (copy sent to you under our printed letter P.2279 of 25th April), it appears that the boundary between the jurisdiction of the Political Agent, Muscat and the Resident 3813b\ at Aden was fixed in 1880 by the! G.of I. at Ras Shajir; that the SuAftin of Muscat has now intimated that the . * *&gt; southern boundary of the Muscat State * is Ras Darbat Ali, and that the Political Resident has suggested that if H.H's. claim to suzerainty over the Kharifol; area in Dhofar is not disputed by thet Sultan of Kishm and Socotra, H.ITs. claim,might be admitted, and the respective jurisdiction^ of the Persian Gulf and Aden Residencies amended accordingly. AV the momoitt ^he present position is that a report is awaited from the Resident at Aden who has stated that he would prefer to consult the Sultai. Socotra of Su-r verbally in the first instanc The area in dispute is not ve^y considerable and, if you concur, I propose to suggest to Bewail that th^ line(might, for the moment, follow the^boundaries of the Aden and the Persian Gulf Residencies and be fixed at Ras_Shajir subject, of course, to amendment ^once the Sultan of Muscat 1 ^ claim has been definitely settled. Would you be so kind as to let me know tueo whether would see any objection to this ? In the meantime I am sending a copy of this letter and of the correspondence between Biscoe and /i-tijLXA. Xf- V (B»4 O.4 at Aden and in the Persian Gulf, on the subject of the southern boundary of the State of Muscat to which reference is made in it. Y^urs sincerely a —Confidential 19 3C» from fae Hon’dle Lieu tenant-Col.on.el H. V. Biscoe, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gul^ Secretary to the Government of India, I have the honour to state that when I visited Muscat in December last Kis Highness the Sultan mentioned to me that he wished to bring to the notice of the Government of India that the southern boundary of the Muscat State was Has Darbat Ali, as he thought there was some ambiguity about the matter. I suggested to His Highness that he should address the Political Agent on the subject as it was obviously not a matter on which it was possible to express an opinion off hand. 2. His Highness has now therefore sent a letter on the subject to the Political Agent of which I Enclose a translation for the information of the Government of India. As far as I am aware there is no local dispute about the boundary* but the reason why His Highness has raised the question is that in 1880 the boundary betv/een the jurisdiction of the Political Agent, Muscat, and the Resident at Aden was fixed at Ras Shajir - vide Poreign and Political Department Ho. 650-E.P., dated the 18th February 1880, to the. Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. Though this boundary should of course coincide with that of the boundaries of the Muscat State, it apparently was not considered necessary at the time to define the latter and Colonel Ross esz expressly suggested in his letter Ho. 236 of the 30th June 1879 to the Foreign and Political Department that the limits of the respective jurisdictions should be fixed “apart from any question of the limits of the Sultan of Muscat* s jurisdiction to the south’*. As His Highness the Sultan of Muscat has hov/ever now raised the question it would seem desirable to settle It. 3. The Dhufar District admittedly belongs to Muscat and Lorimer, Vol, II, P. 442, gives its western boundary as include ing the village of Kharifot which is 17 miles west of Ras Shaj ar.Shaj ar. Further, under the heading Has Shajar, p*448, he mentions that the Government of India in 1879 fixed this cape as the boundary between the political jurisdiction of its officers at Unseat and Aden, and adds 'the convenience of this arrangement is now open to 'question as the Wali of Dhufar has established his control at Rakhyut 13 miles to the westward'. At p. 1386 Lorimar gives the village of Rakhyut as the Oman boundary, though this does not seem altogether consistent with the inclusion of Kharifot in Dhufar: it seems clear that in any case Ras Sajar is not the boundary, and that it extends at least as far as Rakhyut, and presumably as far as Kharifot. His Highness claims sovereignty over the Qara tribe who inhabit Kharifot, and this claim would seem to be justified since in his despatch Ho. 50, dated the 7th February 1881, forwarded to the Government of India under Political Resident’s despatch Ho. 24, dated the ISth February 1881, Colonel Miles reports that 'the Qara Bedouins had also promised to pay their customary dues'. The Political Agent informs me that he understands that this claim is not disputed by the Sultan of Kishm and Socotra. The Resident at Aden will be able to say if this is correct and, if so, then His Highnes claim that the boundary of his territory is Ras Dharbat Ali might be admitted and the respective jurisdictions of the Persian Gulf and Aden Residencies amended accordingly. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Resident at Adenn 0 P Y Translation of letter dated 29th Rajah 1348 (31st December 1929) from H.H. Sir Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, K.C.I.E., Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat, to Major G.P.Murphy, I.A., Political Agent and H.B.M*s. Consul, Muscat. After Compliments, I write this letter in confirmation of my previous verbal conversation with one of H.B.M*s. Consuls about the boundary of my country Dhofar. The mountain known as 'Dharbat Ali” which is situated on the seashore and the western side of Dhofar lies between Dhofar and Maharah country. Tims the Maharah country is situated on the west and the boundary of Dhofar which is under the protection and authority of Muscat is on the east of that mountain. Similarly Wadi Rikoot is the boundary betv/een Oman and Dhofar countries. I deemed it necessary to acquaint you with this matter so that the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the British Government may be aware about it.

As you know we hope some day to effect a junction along an air route round Arabia and I have sent the information therefore to both ends. To turn, lor a moment, to a different but kindred point, I hope whenever from time to time we have to settle up the personal squabbles in the neighbourhood of Sur , /^® tween tiie Sultan of Muscat and the chiefs in the 'J nt or land- that the new interests which are developing owing to the arrival of air power in these regions and the need for an air route through the territory of these E&amp;zPrK&amp;LAd' chiefs, will be kept in mind and will not be overlaid by the weight which earlier needs and conditions have given to our historical policy in respect of Muscat.

I have been busy in the two intervening months camel trekking in the sands of BtTP'AL KHALI and filling in the blanks of Hunter’s Map. It has been great fun.I did not manage to cross the sands this year but did achieve a prismatic compass traverse of about 450 miles of unexplored Arabia reaching a point about 180 miles due north of Dhufar. My aneroid \readings with those of my previous journey through the South Eastern Borderlands discover I think the structure of the south eastern quarter of the peninsula in relation to the rest of it, the unsolved — geographical problem that Hogarth mentions in his ’Penetration’ Thus for 35 days in the saddle I kept fit and led willy nilly a blameless life. The Sultan has considerable influence in and about DHUEAB and my journey was made possible by his assistance (not financial as I footed that myself) in getting my party of 30 local Badus together. H.H. in fact made the sea journey to Dhufar this year for the sole purpose of furthering my aims- delightful of him and characteristic^ ^— . Cm. In cage you are- interested in slight account of the previously unpenetrated Central South I will ask the B.G.S, to send you two cards of admittance for the meeting when my paper is read, that is^if their session is not already at an end. H.H. and I afterwards toured along the South Coast -the frankincense coast of the Ancients where his writ runs i.e. from DEABBAT ALI to HADHBABAM ( the chart names need retransliterating) and landed at the chief ports. There we found the copper currency of Muscat I had introduced tv.otv/o years 'before flourishing like the young hay tree ^o that we could get all the cocoanuts we wanted without the customary hags of salt/^ If you see Peck he may he intei'ested to know that Uutu—f MUKBAT would make a perfect seaplane 'bzrse in the N E monsoon i.e. from October to April.

Prom it to MUKBAT is a favourite haunt of the French Navy on their way to and from the Far East and invariably figures in the programme of the French sloop that pays an annual visit to the | Persian Gulf. This practice dates I think from the treatment accorded to a wrecked French ship there some 20 years ago. BAUTAHARA, MAHRA and ^ AN ABA tribesmen on that occasion scented | ; a rich prize and were for making away with the crew. But the late Shaikh of Murbat (his son and successor ( Ali f was my recent guide there) inspired by more enlightened methods of profit, appeared on the scene and suggested a four days respite in which to arrange and: equitable division of the spoil. During this time he got all his people there. He then made it known that he was for sparing life and protecting property and triumphantly declared to the braves that they must fight him first' before laying a firngM® finger on those whom Allah had all but delivered into their hands.

The question of the exact demarcation of the boundary was raised because of a need to set the administrative boundary between the Political Agent in Muscat and the Political Resident in Aden and, later, the division of areas of responsibility between the air authorities in Iraq and Aden. In 1947 the question is raised again during a period of exploration for oil.The file contains the following papers:Notes on his explorations of the Rub' Al Khali and the territory of the Mahra tribe by Bertram Sidney Thomas, dated 4 March 1930 and 10 January 1947 respectively (folios 97 and 27)Notes on the transliteration and meaning of place names by Claude Edward Urquhart Bremner, Political Agent in Muscat (folio 62)An Account of his journey to Qishn and Socotra by Captain Tom Hickinbotham, Civil Secretary in Aden, 26 April 1935 (folios 53-57)A sketch map of Dhofar by Bertram Thomas (folio 10).The principal correspondents are the Air Ministry, Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Government of India (Foreign Department), Political Residency in Aden, Admiralty, India Office, and the Political Agency in Muscat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Residency, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Bertram Sidney Thomas</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001f9#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
