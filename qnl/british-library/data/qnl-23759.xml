Dear Sir, In conformity with.the instructions you gave at our conversation this morning I now apply for permission to have a portion of my salary paid in New York in dollars. The reason for this step is that my wife, who is an American, is now resident in the U.S.A. and I desire to make an al otment to her. I must inform you that last month I asked the Reserve Bank of India if I might buy, with rupees, dollars for my wife’s use. The request was refused. Since then I have been informed by the New York office of my Company that they can legally pay my wife an allotment in dollars and that exchange covering will not be used for this purpose; but before they make such disbursements they advise me that I should have your permission to accept these dollar payments. The New York office have not indicated how much they are prepared to pay out in these conditions but I am sure that the amount wall not exceed $200 a month. R. A. IENNEDY. LTelegram GTC.

It has, for instance, been an established practice that in the winter, when drafts on India are usually at a premium, the Agency cashes them with you at par, instead of selling them in the bazaar at a profit.

On behalf of the Board, JAMES LEIGH-WOOD,) N. S. COLDER, General Manager. T. J. STRANGMAN, t- Directors. H. BATES, Accountant. P. W. NEWSON, j TO THE SHAREHOLDERS. The Accounts now presented for your consideration closely follow in pattern those of other British Banks operating in the East, inasmuch as we record a * substantial increase of £4,700,000 in Current and Deposit Accounts with a corre sponding increase in cash of £1,700,000 and of £3,000,000 in securities. It is also encouraging to note an expansion of £400,000 in advances to customers. The fall of £360,000 in Bills Receivable is mainly due to a lower holding of Treasury Bills. It will be noticed that freehold property in India shows a reduction of some £100,000, brought about by sales at advantageous prices; since the date of the Balance Sheet further properties have been sold to our satisfaction. Turning to the Profit and Loss Account, the net profit shown after making full provision for contingencies is £98,560— -slightly greater than the corresponding figure for last year. The Board have had under consideration the strengthening of the Reserve Fund, and from the profits of the year £50,000 has been so applied together with a further £50,000 released from Contingencies Fund, thus increasing the published Reserve to £600,000. The first interim dividend for 1943 was raised to 2£ per cent., while the second and final dividend was 3 per cent., thus making a total distribution for the year equal to 5£ per cent, on the paid-up Capital, as against 5 per cent, for the previous year—this is not a great increase but no doubt it has met with approval by Share holders. The net result of these transactions is a carry forward of £79,171, as against £85,610 brought into the account. The commercial situation in India and Ceylon continues to be dominated by Government requirements. Exports consist mainly of commodities essential for the prosecution of the war, purchased by the Ministries concerned. We receive a fair portion of the resulting exchange. There is as yet no marked recovery in exports of commercial goods from this country to the East. Attention has already been drawn in the public press to a thoughtful Paper written by a group of Indian merchants and industrialists in which is set out the policy for a long term development of their country. In the main I find myself in agreement with then aspirations, particularly with the necessity to improve the conditions of the peasantry by assisting agriculture, providing for housing and medical needs and stimulating education. Exchange Banks can of necessity play but a secondary part in domestic affairs, although I am convinced that the Banks will willingly support efforts to bring about a higher standard of living, and I hope extreme politics will not interfere with orderly economic progress. As you know, we have substantial interests in Iraq, and the story there is very similar to that of India. Heavy disbursements on behalf of the Allied Governments, resulting in a great expansion in the note currency, have raised prices to a fantastic extent, which press heavily on the cost of living especially felt by those on fixedTHE EASTERN BANK LIMITED.

On behalf of the Board, JAMES LEIGH-WOOD,! N. S. COLDER, Genera! Manager. T. J. STRANGMAN, [Directors. H. BATES, Accountant. P. W. NEWSON, STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN. ro THE SHA REHOLDERS. The Accounts now presented for your consideration closely follow in pattern those of other British Banks operating in the East, inasmuch as we record a substantial increase of £4,700,000 in Current and Deposit Accounts with a corre sponding increase in cash of £1,700,000 and of £3,000,000 in securities. It is also encouraging to note an expansion of £400,000 in advances to customers. The fa* of £360,000 in Bills Receivable is mainly due to a lower holding of Treasury Bills. It will be noticed that freehold property in India shows a reduction of some £100,000, brought about by sales at advantageous prices; since the date of the Balance Sheet further properties have been sold to our satisfaction. Turning to the Profit and Loss Account, the net profit shown after making full provision for contingencies is £98,560—slightly greater than the corresponding figure for last year. The Board have had under consideration the strengthening of the Reserve Fund, and from the profits of the year £50,000 has been so applied together with a further £50,000 released from Contingencies Fund, thus increasing the published Reserve to £600,000. The first interim dividend for 1943 was raised to 2£ per cent., while the second and final dividend was 3 per cent., thus making a total distribution for the year equal to 5£ per cent, on the paid-up Capital, as against 5 per cent, for the previous year—this is not a great increase but no doubt it has met with approval by Share holders. The net result of these transactions is a carry forward of £79,171, as against £85,610 brought into the account. The commercial situation in India and Ceylon continues to be dominated by Government requirements. Exports consist mainly of commodities essential for the prosecution of the war, purchased by the Ministries concerned. We receive a fair portion of the resulting exchange. There is as yet no marked recovery in exports of commercial goods from this country to the East. Attention has already been drawn in the public press to a thoughtful Paper written by a group of Indian merchants and industrialists in which is set out the policy for a long term development of their country. In the main I find myself in agreement with then aspirations, particularly with the necessity to improve the conditions of the peasantry by assisting agriculture, providing for housing and medical needs and stimulating education. Exchange Banks can of necessity play but a secondary part in domestic affairs, although I am convinced that the Bank? will willingly support efforts to bring about a higher standard of living, and I hope extreme politics will not interfere with orderly economic progress. As you know, we have substantial interests in Iraq, and the story there is very similar to that of India. Heavy disbursements on behalf of the Allied Governments, resulting in a great expansion in the note currency, have raised prices to a fantastic extent, which press heavily on the cost of living especially felt by those on fixed\ ■ / E.O. 16/10.

A very welcome improvement in the speed of mails from the East has enabled us to present to you our Report and Accounts for 1944 with all the promptness of pre-war years. We have thus been able to revert to the former practice of recommending a final dividend for your approval at the General Meeting to be held on the 21st March, instead of declaring a second interim dividend prior to the Meeting. The rate of 3s. per share proposed for the final dividend will make the total distribution for the year equal to 5£ per cent, as for 1943 when the figures shown were within two hundred pounds of the present net profit of £98,704 14s. Od. In pursuance of the policy to increase the published Reserve Fund, the Board have appropriated £50,000 from the net profit and a further £50,000 from Contingencies Account, bringing the Fund up to £700,000. After allowing for the interim dividend paid in October and the final dividend now proposed, the balance of Profit to be carried forward will be £72,876 2s. Id. against £79,171 8s. Id. brought in. I referred last year to the sale of our freehold properties in India and I am glad to inform you that we have satisfactorily disposed of all but one of about £30,000 book value, yielding a good revenue. As customary the figure of net profit was reached after appropriations to the credit of Contingencies Account, out of which account provision has now been made for all remaining assets in Singapore except balances with other Banks there. Whilst it is hoped that the assets thus written off are not irretrievably lost, it was considered prudent to face an unfavourable outcome. Of other changes in the Balance Sheet the most striking by comparison with the figures of the preceding year is the reduction in liabilities on Current and Deposit Accounts of some £1,375,000 which is reflected in the smaller holding of Cash by £735,425 and of Bills Receivable by £695,357. These changes were in fact transitory, record higher levels being reached in the first few days of January. Our holding of Government Securities is greater by £300,000—in round figures—and there is a slight increase in Advances to Customers. There has been no marked change in the commercial situation in India and Ceylon during the past year. With few exceptions the surplus of commodities available for export is purchased by British Government Departments and paid for by Telegraphic Transfer on London. It is to be supposed that this method must continue for some time yet, whilst the absence of consumer goods for import still further restricts the functions of the Exchange Banks as formerly practised. In India the establishment of several indigenous Banks, under strong local auspices, has necessarily resulted in keen competition for advances. Louring the year a steady stream of Government Loans has been issued, both in Inuia and Ceylon, all of which have been readily subscribed. Further, in India there have been substantial sales of gold and silver through the Reserve Bank. Notwithstanding these efforts to control inflation the note circulation in each country is now about six times the pre-war figure. This is a prodigious increase and as the note issue in each case is to a large extent represented by sterling securities and balances in this country, a problem of great complexity must be faced at the end of the war. The situation in Iraq is very similar as the supply of money is more than ample. There is an urgent demand for consumer goods in the Bazaars which cannot be wholly met at present from this country owing to a shortage of manufactureall letters to be addressed to THE EASTERN BANK LIMITED.

The clerk concerned did not actually refuse to take the three letters mentioned therein but asked the messenger, who brought them, to get the contents described on them; firstly to know what he had to sign for and secondly, of course, what he was required to forward to the Residency. On one occasion a sterling bank draft was lost and my clerk who handled the cover from your Bank to the Resi dency was held responsible. 3. It is clear that the forwarding of your Bank's letters for the Residency which usually concern money receiots, bank drafts, etc., places resnonsibility on our staff which is not of their concern, and if anything is lost they are blamed. Could you kindly deliver your mail direct to the Residency in future or raake some arrangement direct with them for their collec tion from the Bank.

From a perusal of my receipt book,it will be noticed,that these letters bear no numbers, and heng^at a later date, I cannot say that any particular^'so received has been definitely transferred.

It appears that it was agreed between the Agency and the Bank that we would not demand ©n interest on our current account ( which incidentally is about Rs.£§/==th4s=yesr 55,000,this year) and that the Bank in return would not charge commission on our supply bills etc. This had been the practice for the last 13 years but now the Bank are apparently unwilling to continue on this ar angenent. There are two ways that we can reimburse our treasury here:- (i) selling a supply bill to the bank. In case bank lias to make any remittance to India they are very grateful for such a supply bill because it saves them freight etc., but now since they have to bring money from India,they are unwilling to cash our cheques at par. (ii) by drawing on the Post Office. /e give the Post Office a receipt and adjust the account through A.G.C.R. The Bank’s point of view can be summed up as below (a) They will not cash our supply bills unless we pay them a com ission of 1% (b) They will not give us silver rupees even on our cheque on our current account unless we pay 1% commission. When they refused to cash our supply bill, we sent a cheque, but still they would not give silver rupees whichW * require for our Pittances to Sharjah. I am not aware if Bank could refuse to give silver even on our current account in Bahrain. If the Bank would not cash our bills on par, it seems the question will have to be referred to Bushire. /e have often to cash our bills and if we start paying Rs.50/- for eveiy bill of Rs.5,000/-, it will be difficult to adjust our account with the A.G.C.R. The question at present is whether Sharjah monthly remittances could be made in currency notes.( From pre-page). 2, The position of the Tiroerial Bank of India ( where there is no Branch of the Reserve Bank of India) is quite different from that of the Eastern Bank of Bahrain, as before the inauguration of the Reserve Bank of India, the Imperial Bank oi India under Government of India Act was considered to be a Government Treasury. But when the Reserve Bank of India started functioning,the control of the Indian Finanace was placed directly under it and the Imperial Bonk of India ceased to be a Government Treasury. 3. Where there is no Branch of the Reserve Bank of India the Imperial Bank of India still conducts the duties of a Govt. Treasury hut under certain conditions i.e. mainly the LETTER OF CREDIT C which is an authority issued by the Controller of Currency, Accountant General of the Province and the Director of the Posts and Telegraph Dept, stating the amount which a disbursing Officer can draw from the Bank) is passed to the “^ank and then the Bank make payments tot he Department concerned and adjusts its accounts direct with the Accountant General of the Province. 4. Since we have no letter of credit on the Eastern '^ank Bahrain it cannot be considered to be a Govt Treasury or a double lock. The point is that the Eastern ^etfik Bahrain has been cashing our drafts at par for the last 13 years and we have never charged them interest or commission ( while the Bank sometime pay 2 % to the Publie)when they want to remit money to India This shows that within the last 13 years they have considerably gained from us and it was not a favour at all if they cashed out cheques at par.

The file’s principal correspondents are the Political Agent and representatives (usually the manager) of the Bahrain branch of the Eastern Bank Limited (M Gunn; T J De La Mare; D Ham). The file is a direct chronological continuation of ‘Miscellaneous 16/10 Eastern Bank Ltd: Correspondence with ––’ (IOR/R/15/2/1503).Covering the years of the Second World War, much of the correspondence relates to wartime circumstances and events:in December 1941, used stamp collections to raise funds for the air raid victims of German bombing raids on Portsmouth (ff 20-21);in October 1942, the introduction of cheque book charges, in response to the rising costs of paper and printing (f 37);in November 1942, an acute shortage of small coinage in India (f 38);in 1944, efforts to send money to the wife of a Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) employee who was resident in Beirut, in light of the Levant region no longer being part of the Sterling Bloc (ff 47-62).Other correspondence covers: in 1941, the efforts of three BAPCO employees to set up a private trading company; also in 1941, changes to rates for the purchase of Agency demand drafts in India; in 1949, issues arising from the redirection of mail from the Political Agency to the Political Residency (based in Bahrain from 1947). The file also contains copies of reports and annual accounts for the Eastern Bank Limited, dated May 1944 (f 65, duplicate at f 69) and March 1945 (f 73), and a copy, in English and Arabic, of the Eastern Bank Bahrain’s rules for savings deposit accounts (ff 23-28).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Financial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Banking</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000ef#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
