R.M.H. 15-3-44.it 111(»«u ) FILE No. 28/5-V . ' : Mr. Allacard of Messrs. Gray !;ackenzie &amp; Co., Limited, Bahrain asked me whether it would noc be possible for us to issue him with signed export permits for tankers whicn he would issue v/hen required, number them serially and report issues at end of each month to us. Object of this being to save a last minute rush in obtain ing permits. Export permits are issued under Regulation No. 1 of 1940 and all exports to destinations other than British possessions had to be referred to India Office. These instructions were modified - please flag relevant correspondence. 1 d• / — R.E.R. , 13.5.'45. The instruction about oil Shipments from Bahrain is at page 43 in File 28/5-1 (flagged) according to which we have to obtain prior permission from India office to issue export licences for shipments of oil to any destination other than British possessions . n The ^ subsequent instructions at page in Volume II of th$ same file (flagged and linked) say that export licences for Egypt and Sudan can be granted by this Agency without prior reference to India Office, but intimations should be sent to them by Airmail whenever licences are granted to those countries. In July 1S43 lnd.ia Office intimated us saying that it, is unnecessary to consult them before granting export licences for oil shipments from Bahrain in view of their close control over tankers vide page ^ in Volume the same file (flagged and linked). * v - In their latest instruction at page v^ry in Volume W 3 C India Office has clearly said that it was not necessar/ to send then, even the individual reports of export licences issued for oil shipments. But their permission must be obtained if the shipments are made to Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland or Turkey. In practice such shipments do not take place at Bahrain. All the relevant pages in the File have been flagged and linked for your perusal. Id./- V.B.S.Manian, 15.5.1945. 1. please see my note at 'A' above. The issue of export permits for oil from Bahrain began with Page 43 of Vol. I. The immediate object was to control exports to Tenyriefe (para 2 of page 43). 2. Regulation No 1 of 1940 was issued 3. The orders regarding export licences have been amended from time to time as follows;-* Page 43~ Vol (Para 2) We were allowed to issue for British destinations only without prior reference to India Office Page ' I Vol n - ye were allowed to issue to Egypt and^ Sudan in extension of previous orders but had t&lt;^ report permits issued to l.o. Page^ &lt;fr yol. U . - India Office say they don't want to be consulted at all unless we have any doubt. Reason being the close control over tankers (July 1943).Page ^ o Vol H ‘. India Cfiice say they don't want | JUS reports of issue of export permit^.$ They still want their previous I agreement to shipments to Spain, | d Portugal, Sv/eden, Switzerland or | 0 Turkey. [a 4 . The introduction ^ - of export permits for oil shipments irom Bahrain was made at the request of the Ministry of ;/ar Transport to control the Oil Coy.'s exports to destinations i/ve considered undesirable. From the entry of the U.S.A. inuo the war and che fusion of our interests, the export by oapco m U.S.A. or British tankers of oil to undesirable destinations oecame extremely unlikely. There remained the possiDiii.y ox a divergence of opinion or policy and presumably for this amongst other reasons the India Office wishes us to ’ refer to them before issue of permits for Spain, Portugal, Sv/eden, Switzerland or Turkey. 5 * . The issue of export permits to all other destinations except these 5 countries now appears redundant and a waste oi time. SO y° u agree, I suggest we ask the P.R. if the issue 5&gt;l ox export permits to destinations other than those 5 countries I may now oe discontinued as it appears to serve no useful purpose any longer. 6 ‘ f w P1 ? ase also see note re: these files on a separate now@ sneet• Do you agree - with my suggestion?

Each report is compiled by the Director of Customs and Port Officer and comes in the form of a table with the following information:name of ship;nationality of ship;name of owners;date of arrival;date of departure;number of packages landed at Bahrain (in tonnes);number of packages transhipped to the mainland (in tonnes);quantity (in tonnes) and nature of cargo shipped from Bahrain (including goods from mainland transhipped at Bahrain);destination.Included within the file is correspondence between the Bahrain Political Agency and the Director of Customs and Port Officer. This is mostly concerned with the exclusion of figures on petroleum products in the reports, which was viewed as a security risk during the Second World War. From May 1947 these figures were reintroduced. From July 1947 they were included as separate statements to those on general cargo.Folios 144-53 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000153#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
