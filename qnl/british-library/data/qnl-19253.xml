The first enclosure is an extract of paragraphs 3 and 4 of despatch no.32 of 1854 from the Court of Directors, dated 22 November 1854. The paragraphs relate to the resources required by the Persian Gulf Squadron for the suppression of the slave trade on the Arabian coast, with the Court of Directors considering that the estimate of the number of vessels required, made by Sir Henry Leeke, Commodore and Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy, is too high. The second enclosure is letter no.543 of 1855 from Anderson to Leeke, dated 6 February 1855. In the letter Anderson requests that, whenever the resources are available, Leeke reinforce the Persian Gulf Squadron for the purpose of the suppression of the slave trade.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x000005#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
