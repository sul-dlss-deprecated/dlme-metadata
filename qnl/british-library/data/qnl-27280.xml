His best known treatise, Kitāb al-bāri' fi ahkām an-nujūm (Complete book on the judgment of the stars), was one of the works translated by the team of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim scholars that King Alfonso X of Castile (reigned 1252–84) assembled in Toledo to translate works of Arabic science into Latin and Castilian Spanish. A manuscript copy containing five of the eight books of a translation into Old Castilian by Yehudā ben Moshe Cohen survives and is in the National Library of Spain. De Judiciis Astrorum (Complete book of the judgment of the stars), a Latin translation of the Old Castilian manuscript, was published in Venice in 1485 and became an important source in Renaissance Europe for the understanding of medieval astrology. The printer was Erhard Ratdolt, a member of a distinguished family of artisans from Augsburg, Germany, who went to Venice around 1475 and established a successful printing business.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Spain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arab Astronomy</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Augsburg, Germany</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Medieval Astronomy</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Tunisia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Astrology</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/7387#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
