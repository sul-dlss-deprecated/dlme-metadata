Prom Political Sx^dtxAMuacat To Political Baghiai repeated Foreign Delhi and Political 3uaiJ&gt;re. No.437 dated 5/2/20. The Sultan Of Muecat has received information that the town and customs house of Maunaah have been attacked by the Yal Saad. These are not Omanis but a coastal tribe with a bad reputation. Appeals for help have been made by the Sultan whose yacht is at Bombay and by the British subjects of the place. The disturbance may be directly attributed to the situation a.f Sur. The maintenance of the Sultan's authority on the coast is incumbant on us. Will you please telegraph to the Naval Commander in Chief who is expected at Muscat on 6 th.February asking him to provide a ship if it should be found necessary which could convey me and some of the Sultan's men to Masnaah? The ship will not be delayed more than two or three days. The fact that we are determined to assist the Sultan to maintain order on the coast must be brought home in as clear a amnner as possible and the Sheikh can be definitely warned by me that this is the case. I do not anticipate that it will be necessary xato ask the ship to take any further action and it would only be advisable to bombard the fort if the situation should prove very critical. Telegram P.

X X X X X Misc e1lane ougo 23 o News was received from on 5th February that the Yal Saad under one 11 asud bin Zamit had attacked the town which was virtually in a state of siege. Details w&amp;ioh arrived later showed that on the 2nd February when the wotk of erecting the new Customs buildings was started llasud with his followers, as a protest against the new Customs system, oc occupied the road leading to the kasnaa bazaar, prevented the import of water and fodder into the town , and effectively st- stopped the ingress or egress. About 50 men of the Yal Saad a&lt; the same time forcibly took possession of Saiyid Talib’s house situated near the tower kahadan, On learning this the Vfali of kasnaa sent five of his men to the Yal Raad acting them to clear the way. The Yal Saad at once opened fire which the Wall's men returned resulting casualties or; the side of the Yal Saado 0 ^ Firing haa occurred since, but the situation remains much the same. The Wall has 150 armed men with him in the fort,. The Yal Saad are in possession of the bazaar and a ^virtual state of siege exists* The period of actual danger has passed, and the Yal Saad are willing to come to ^ terms but the success of this open defiance of the Sultan*e authority will have serious effect unless some raean^ can be 1 taken to show the tribesmen of the coast generally that such efforts do not go unpunished. The action of the Yal baad at Ma^naa is directly attributable to the success of those defying the Customs at Sur and justifiable fears are enter- -tained that if His Highness the Sultan should be unable toto enforce hie authority in this second case as well, the work of the new customs will be impossible for some time » These two incidents above have caused a heavy loss to his revenues. The British Subjects of ISasnaa have sent letters to the Political Agent and H.M»s Consul to take steps to protect their lives and property. His Highness the Sultan is taking all possible steps in the matter*» kl(, British Consulate ani Political Muscat, 10th February From R*E#L*Wingate Ssq* X*CoBo Political A^ent and Consul, I^i^cat. To The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. Plosee rofer to paragraph 23 of Muscat diary dated loth February, I have nothin,, to aid to the details there &amp;lven on the events at Maanaah, I would however emphasise most strongly that action by us in support of the Sultan, even if it only be moral support is very necessary, and in addition will be of material advantage to us. The Sultan has thrown himself practically unreservedly upon our supno^t now, and his attitude is- * You have paid my debts, you are mana£in&amp; wy customs, add I realise that without your support I shoulti not be able to maintain my authority stltll. But you munt maintain it or you will do nothing with the customs , 11 Tue Sur episode where the importers refused to pay the customs dues showed the impotence of . e Sultan, an impotence which he confessed. At tne same time he expressed the opinion that did we not assist him there other porta would follow the same line as they would see that they could do so with impunity. In this I entirely agreed with him and kt the time asked for a ship 5n which to visit Sur, though there was no actual danger, simply to show the people that we were behind the Sultan at once and to ensure as far as possibl thht such episodes did not occur in the future. Unfortunately no ship *aB available at the time and an invaluable chance was lost. The Masnaah affair is the Sur affair overa^aln, except that a little fl^Utln# hae ta.«ven ; lac# at Maenaah whereas at Biu' the people were strong •n#ughj*^#t their own way without resorting to it, ani is without^ts direct reault. Here at;aJ.n the period of dancer, when it was feared that British subjects might be attacked and their property looted, has passed* But unless the Yal a &gt; aee ^ the Sultan has our help, and the beat way in will oh they will gee this is by seeing one of H*!^*s ships, w# iMay confidently expect sinilar incidents at frequent intervals, and the consequent cessation of all customs incotie except fron the ocrts of Muscat and Mat trail* It may not be out of lace to state that such conditions will mean discrimination against Pritlsh subjects contrary to the terms of the treaty, as tney alone w 5 .!l pay five per cent, and everybody else will trade free* One of H.M’s ships has not been seen at Muscat since September, and though I am aware there must have been £ood reason for t.-ls, yet I believe, subject to correo- -tion, that this period of absence constitutes a record for r.'py years* W# are also engaged in very delicate negotiations with the interior, and we are anxious to get the Sultan off to India on his visit.

I had wished to visit Sur some two months ago where there had been trouble over the customs and had asked for a ship for this purpose and in order to assist the Sultan. The opinion was expressed l»y me that should the Sultan not be supported by us there was a strong probability of similar events occuring elsewhere. It was impossible to provide a ship. The same thing has happen- -ed at Masnaah, where however the period of actual danger seems to have passed. It is impossible to do anything as it is presumed that no ship will be available till the arrival of the Naval C in G at the end of the month. It is unfortunate that on two occasions when the Sultan has especially asked for help over his customs which are practically under our control, that we should have been unable to supply it. Storms have dlayed the negotiations with Oman but tney are progressing well and this event should have no effect upon them. The sheikh in question is Masud.NO* Of 192Q.

Political Resident In the Persian Gulf, Baghdad. sir * ^ ^ I have the honour to invite a reference to the letter (No.476 dated 10th February' ) from the Political Agent and lie Ja.jesty’s Oon ml at Muao&amp;t to youraddress on the subject of tne absence of H.M.Ships from Muscat, and the hecesdity of supporting the authority of His Highness the Sultan on the Coast. 2. As you are aware, it has been for many years past the practice of His Majesty*s Government and the Government of India to sup port the authority of the Sultan on the Coast - both at his capital and Muttra, and to a lesser degree at other places - as far as possible and the exigencies of the other duties of ti.'j . Ships in the Persian Gulf and Gul? of Oman permit. In fact, when the full number of gunboats - viz three - are available for duty in the QUlf it is usually the practice, unloea dSr* apeclai duty, such as a blockade, is being performed, to station one of them at the ’ asterr end of the Gulf or in the Gulf of Oman, nore or less based on Muscat. 3. The reason why no ship of war has been seen at Muscat since last September is siaple: there was not one available. Since that time only one ship, H.M.3. 'Britoraart', has been in the Gulf and she was required up the river. AtAt that time it expected that the new jcmior iiaval Officer would be arriving in H.H,3* '’iriad T * and it waa intended that when he did, , *dritOEmrt w should go to Muscat. The Political Agent was informed of thle in hocernbor last. -fowev^r owing to Capt. Bevan’s unfortunate death the 'Triad' never turned up, and U^l'.ohipa f, Bdin* and 'Sspieglo* which were intend., j for the Gulf* iiave boon held up first at .iOdeida a^ nd inore recently in Conali land. On my arrivnl at Xoweit on the 7th February l received from H.M.S. 'britCT-art' a copy of the Political Agent’s wire of ?th February asking that ona of H,M.Ohips with the liaval Corsmander-inr Chiof might be diverted to Muscat, and thinking that His Excel lency might be inconveniencod by the absence of H.? . 8 . 'iriad', which I thought was accompanying him, I offored him the une of R.I.M.S. 'Lawrence* to t^ko him up the riverythus, as 1 thought freeing a ship for 'uscat* but i afterwards h^ard that H.M.:,. 'Triad' was not with the Conman-far-in-Ghiof and tnat other arran gements were made, and B.H•S. 'britomart' was eventually despatch ed to ,, '.’pcat, Prom ♦he above I think it will bo seen that it has been im possible to send a ship to Muscat before, add in the circumotanoee it seems hardly necessary to have troubled the government of India about the natter at all.

M Eritomart* for Masnaa on 5th in connection witn the Masnaa affairs and returned to Muscat on Bth ( copies of reports have been submitted to the Civil Commssioner Baghdad and the Deputy Political Resident, ^ Bushire .)Extract fron diary Ko* 9 of 192Q dated Muscat, the 25tii March 1920« There were strong rumours of an intended attaak by the Omanis on the Batineh coast ports. These no doubt arose on account of the meeting of the tribesmen which took place at Rustaq in the interior. The reason of the gathering is not known definitely but it is said that the object is to settle tribal disputes. At the sane tine it was also rumoured that tne Yal ftaad being dissatisfied owing to the Masna affair(vide entry IJo.52 diary JfeJo. 8 ) as^ed the Iman and Sheikh Isa bin Salin who were at Ilustaq to help him then. This together with the fact that Masud bin Zamit Chief of the Yal Saad failed to come to Muscat as promised by him to the Wazir to His 'ighness the Sultan in writing gaize cause to apprehend some mischief on his part and the presence of one of His Majesty^ Ship was considered desirable. Masud bin Zamit however arrived at 7/ataiyaf 3 miles from Muttra) on the 24th. He came to Muscat on the 25th paid fine of dollars 5000/-,tendered full apology for his past raisconducf and solemnly promissed to obey all orders given to him in futureHOTS OH THE SLAVE SEALING BY THE YAL SAAB &gt; OH ^PHE BATIHEH COAST. \ ctivdly in The Yal Saad have recently engaged themselves actively the slave trade* slaves are mostly imported from the Mekran Coast,'between Char 'bar and Jask f by the assistance of Mokrani Sardars and other local Baluc^his and taken over to the Batineh Coast whence they are conveyed to Udham and Khaddra, villages inhabited by the Yal Saad* Thespfe slavasr are readily bought by the Yal Saad who either keep them /or find sale for them on the Trucial Oman Coast* The local Govt, has practically been powerless to have any check over this trade. Early in 1921,within the short space of a month,4 cases of slaves^comprising of 40 persons^ were brought to the Consulate* These slaves were brought from the Mekran Coast and landed in UdLam and Khaddra. These case were re~ '-ported in detail to the Resident,vide this office No,239 dated 6-2-21* One Rashid bin Hunaid,Baluch ,residing in Kaddrah and who is connected in these cases was ordered to be arrested and punished by the Resident,vide his 1101977, was also to be recovered from him* The- local Govt, was requested to arrest the-man but they have so far been unable to effect the man’s arrest* Rashid is at large and is favoured and well protected by the Yal Sa—ad* in which Another case/o* 2 ehildren,Bannie and Shambey, were brother end sister/kidnapped and taken to Ehaddra by Shaikh Kha lid bi n Ahmed *The case was reported from Garrig by the Telegraph Official Mr Navarra in December 1921* / I The as«s as usual brought to the notice of H.H’s Ministers . / t if on^OMMNi occasions but they have failed to do anything in the matter and to rescue these unfortunate children* Apparently the local govt has very little or no authority o T er che ial oaad and we can therefore expect nc . satis factory result in casesrwhich are referred to the local authorities* MV V ^ CvX v* v w Vi V. y VH* . 4 . V# VA. U dated 3.11. A sum of Rs*/«*\ in A pril 1922 a slave, Sharabey s/o Fakirdad, 50 years old, eacaped from hi a captivity and came to the Consulate from Eaddrah.Kc was actually in fetters which were cut open here. He was accompanied by his wife,son and a cousin,He stated that his 4 other * children were still in slavery on the Batineh Coast,The Wali of S^uwaiq was asked to try and £-ind out the children but he asked the old father of the children to accompany the askaris to Kaddra and to point ou-fc the children. The old man was afraid of kjolng being recaptured and did not go and the matter dropped there, • Udhara is a notorious spot on the Batineh Coast for salve dealing, Hei* a one ^le iman bin Yusu f took a Baluch boy,I!iku bin Khamisa„to Sharga and sold him to Saeed bin 17ayed,a blind old man,The boy was originally kidnapped from Bahu in Biaban unde# the Govt, of Din Mahomed bin Abdi and wa g brought to Udhem. The boy was sold for Bs.87c/~to Mayed and an undertaking was given to him that if it was proved that the boy was en slaved and kidnapped he would refund the above amount together with any other loss that ma^y be incurred, SkBxxxjccs The boy was subsequently taken charge of by the Residency Agent in Sharga and the case was reported to the Resident at Bushire who wrote to this Consulate, vide his Ho*64,dated 14,1,22,and asked to move the local Govt and to recover the above amount from Suleiman bin Yusuf of Udham.The cage was accordingly brought to H.H’s Ministers 1 notice but they have not been able to do anything in the matter. They, however f stated that E.H’s Govt had not been able to punish those who were' concerned in the burning down of the Customs post at Udham and it was unlikely they could do anything in this case. The- offender. t/has bee Suleiman has remained at large so far. His arres^has been promised by the Wali of Masnaa in the evnt of Suleiman re turning to Udham, In Sept.1921 another boy.Towfick bin Jamwar.was kidnapped and taken to Mulladah f a village near Udham and inhabitted by the Yal Saad.The D.P.G.Telegraphs requested the P.A.to do something to rescue the boy as he was the son of Mir Earkat^ representa tLve,The boy was reported to be with one Uahmood binA✓'li tin Hassan in Mulladah.The case was referred to H.H’s Ministers who asked the Wali of Masnaa to make enquiries into the case hut nothing has so far been done, in January 19&amp;1,3 Baluchis,Shahdad,Kekal and Raj ah,took refuge at this Consulate having run away from Udhara. They reported that 3 women,? hoys and 4 girlaltogether with them, were kidnapped from Kunarak by one Gul Mahomed*They were sent to Udham for sale in chsrtfge- of Omar bin Husein and Abdur Rahim in a dhow.At Udham they were landed and kept in a house.fxiWO wktxfc The 3 Baluchis^ named above^ escaped at night, got in the dhow which took them there and came to Muscat.The remaining 14 women,bo#s and girls,were^in the meantime^taken to the interior for sale,The dhow in which the 3 Baluchis escaped was taken charg«p&gt;y the local govt, and the Tali of Masnaa was ordered to follow the offenders and to recover the 14 persons.but without HI***' any result, Abdur Rahim,one of the two^who took these slaves to Udham was arrested in Ma’ttra in la^March by the Wall u and is confined in the Fort at It will be noticed from the above notes that slave cases as they come to the notice of this Consulate^ have been regularly placed before the lofal Govt and assistance sought in their freedom and punishment of the offenders but^no case has there been any satisfactory result. As already r.uiiioHft remarked above the H.H’s authority over the salve trading / villages on the Batine^i Coast is practically nil and therefore the recovery of slaves once landed makes it extremely difficult. The only remedy to check this nefarious trade is to have a Navy Ship patrolling on the Batineh Coast and to punish thogpr pursuing the trade.This will no doubt^ instil fear in the hearts of those indulging in the salve trade and will gradually give it up.W U D A M (Village of Eastern Tribe of Ya^JL Shaikhs Masmd bin Zamit (of Muld^dah) Mohammad bin Said (of Qarat) Saif bin Said (of Thamiad) Translation of a letter dated 28th January 1922 from the Council of Ministers to the above Shaikhs sent per Shaikh Rashid bin Uzaiz Sharah Ministers who was sent to settle the Customs question with the Yal Saad, We have written a letter to you on the 27th Jamadi I (26th January 1922) regarding your opposition for the thing which the government want and explained to you its consequences which you will have to suffer.

Vtadam is the groat centre for this illicit trade. 1 2h9 Muscat Government have asked for our assistance in dealing with this tribe, and it will bo seen that Major Rae suggest an ultimatum to the tribe to submit to their Government before the 16th October, to pay a fine of ^ 10,000 to their Government for their misbehaviour and as compensation for the loss of revenue caused thereby, and to agree to the estabUhhnont of CustomsCustoms Rousos at Wudam and Khadra* She Polltioal Agent also suggests a separate ultimatum calling on the tribe of Khadra, or to pay a fine of ^ 8 # 000. It may bo observed that 1 have been trying to got the Oman authorities to apprehend Rashid bln PUmaid for the past two years, but without success owing to the rebellious conduct of the Yal 3aad* In view of the facts that the Muscat Govom- mont hayo asked for our aflBistance, and that as long as the Yal saad remain •Taghi* and the ports of TTudam and Yhadm without Customs Houses, the Yal saad country will remain a happy hunting ground for slave dealers, I co^- older that it 1 n moot advisable that we sliould give the assistance of one of H # M # Ships* Tho Senior Naval Officer has promised to ono available in the latter half of October# I therefore propose to authorize Ttajor Rae to carry on in anticipation of the approval of tho Govern- rent of India, as time is short# I have however told him that t?ie Tn^cat Government shoiTld give the ultimatum to the Yal saad as regards Rubriosion, fine agreement to the establishment of custom Fousos etc, wtilfce he should give tho ultimatum regarding the m?.rremdor of the notorious slave Ccrler Rashid bin Fumaid of Ty hrdra# I think it more, thi n probable that when the Ya3 faad see one of IUM*ShlpB appear off tlioir coast they will cave in at once, Should they not do co however I propose to authorize limited bombardment first on outlying towers and thon on forts until they do mirronder# I trust the Government of India will approve of tho course outlined above, but should they, for any reason not do 50 ,• r bog that the fact may be telegraphed to me without delay# I have the honour to be, Sir, * Tour moat obedient servant Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.A Ko. 50«C Karachi 19th Septeitber 1922. from To Sir, t ajor U.

These are identical except as regards condition 5. It will be noticed in connection vith this condition that 1 have ven tured to authorise the Council to demand the surrender of ul&amp;injm bln Yusuf. This man is referred to in your Secre tary' s endorsement No. 64 of 14th JUunuary 1922. Rio cage es caped sy meniory when writing my letter Ho. Bu 1 of 28th Au gust 1922 on this subject. It was recalled to my memory by the Council who suggested that the occasion vris a suitable l one for setting the case against this man, and that the de mand for his surrender would balance the two ultimatums so to speak, in the ciroumstances 1 thought myself justified in authorifcing the demand without further reference. 1 trust my doing so may be approved. The only other point to which I have to refer is condition 3 of the Council*s ultimatum. I gave the council to understand that 1 was not authorised to support a demand for any taxes other than those formerly levied from the Yol Snad irrespect ive of any taxes paid by other tribes, he ultimatums were kindly taken by Uommander Hrandon, eniorsenior Bar&amp;l officer, in K.

Your stoat obedient servant ^j/7 Major Polltloal Agent A H.J.K's Consul Muscat.Karachi, 19th September 1922 Vy dear Colonel, I got the copy of your letter to Government about the Yel Said on 15th September n-fter despatch of the ultimatums and time as I was about to leave for Bombay. Being pressed for *w±sx I thought to answer it on board ship but most stupidity left it looked up in I uscat and so cannot refer to it officially, I sent toda^/£opies cf the ultimatums iisued. You will see that the demand for the surrender of Rashid bin Rumeid is included in the ultimatum of the Council of rinisters. This is not in accordance vrith the instructions to me cuoted in your letter to Government, arid I am sorry I misunderstood your instructions on this point. But 1 think I correctly understood and acted on your main inten tion which I took and still take to be that my ultimatum should y not contain the detailed demands of the Yuscat Government. I ver k much hope I have not misunderstood, and^that you will approve of my authorising the demand for the surrender of Sulaiman bin Yusu-f Brandon very kindly undertook to show the flag along the Batinalu Coast on hie ray up and to carry messengers to deliver the ultimatums to the Walls of Wasnaah and Slfwai (j.

'Cyclajien' proceeded along the coast to Masnah, v/here she anchored and 1 ordered a boat. The latter, however, proved to be unnecessary as the ’Akid came off at once. He explained that the Jail was temporarily absent on a visit to Harkah. He was informed that he would be held responsible that the messenger from Muscat was sent on at once to the Mali and delivered the letter addressed to him without delay. This the 'Akid undertook to attend to and the messenger was then sent ashore with him. 9 Continuing along the coast past Judam 'Cyclamen' anchored off Suwaik at sundown. The Wall of Suwaik, Ahmed bin Ibrahim, came on board very promptly and the two envelopes addressed to him were handed*to him personally. He stated that he would carry out his instructions regard ing the Yalsad tribe and the cases of the two slaves without delay. He interviewed the two men, who had been sent to assist in locating the slaves, in my presence. The answers of the younger man did not appear to be very satisfactory. However, they were both sent ashore with the Tali, who promised to do his best. The second messenger was landed at the same time, the flail being instructed to send him back to Muscat by the first oonortunity. L. Next morning 'Cyclamen' proceeded along the coast past A1 Khadhra and on to Sohar. Here the flali,'Saiyid Hamad, did not come off at once, so the ship's interpreter was sent ashore to give him my compliments and say I*should be very pleased to see him if he were able to come on board right away, but the ship would be leaving in an hour's time in any case. He then came off immediately in the ship's boat and apologised for not having come before, explaining that his own boat was damaged. I promised to visit him on shore if possible at some later date.

It seems to me that if levies are withdrawn before matter is settled and without doing anything they are likely to get bad name and fall into contempt which would be bad start for them. Have most of Yal Saad left Khadra and their other ports? Could not levies seize and occupy one of local forts till Yal Saad sees reason or something of that sort? Of course at this distamce it is difficult to make any useful suggestion but I think Yal Saad would not-b£ likely to prove amenable in any contemplated negotiations if they remain masters of the situation.

Govornnont of India a copy of a letter from the Political Agent, 'nzscat, reporting tho action taken against tho rebellious Yal saad tribo of Oman, at tho request of tho Government of His Highness tho sultan* Two ultimatums were addressed to the Yal Saad tribe by tho Fuacat Government on the 11th September - one to tho Khadra and one to tho V/udam section of the tribe, directing then to comply with the terms before the 15th October* Tho terms wore firstly each section to or.y a fine of / 5000 $ secondly, to allow the erection of customs Houses and protect thorn; thirdly, to pay their revenue and taxes; fourthly, to refrain from slave dealing; fifthly, to hand over the notorious slave dealers Rashid bin Humaid and suieman bin Yusuf, tho Khadra section tho former and the Vfudaa section the latter or pay a fine of 2000 and # 500 respectively; sixthly, to sond their loading men to make submission with the fines in full* The Political * Agent also issued a warning letter to the rhoikha of theOS tho Yal saad Informing them that if thoy declined to make full aubniasion to their Government by tho date specified ho was authorlssed to co-oporato \7ith latter and would call on the Captain of H»M«3hip to take action against them. The ultimatum expired on tho 15th October, but a a atatod in the Political Agont’a letter onclooed tho Yal Saad had already refused to comply with the t&lt; iY’a* On the 18th October the Political Agent loft for suwaiq in •Cyclamen' having with him Sayyid Nadir tho brother of the sultan representing tho Muscat oovommont and narty of uscat levies under Oantain McCarthy, A detailed narrtitivo o ’ tho events which followed is given in tho uacat Agency diaries extracts from which aro annexed to v a,1or Rao’s letter, and it is unnecessary for me to repeat them here* Tho Yal saad Chiefs were got in with difficulty on the 20th Ootoh r, but they wore eulto recalcitrant refusing to submit though warned that a bombardment *would take place 3 hours after sunrise the next day* on the morning of tho 21st H#?f*S*'Cyolainen' carried out tho first bombardment, but inmediatoly afterwards had to leave as a 'S*0*S*' signal was received from the 'Hritiah General' a tanker which had gone ashore near T'Usandam and was in distress* Owing to th$s, operations had to be susnondod till the 27th October when H. f '*s» w ? spiegle' arrivod f Various onorations such as seizing dhows and bombardments on the 1st and 3rd November by H*M«S**Kspiegle' (vide 'iiscat The Senior .aval Officer on board R,TT # s.'Cyclamen' returned on tho 13th novonbor and certain measures against Yal Saad dhows wore taken and some negociatlons between tho Yal saad and the t usoat ?iniaters took olace O^uscat diary entry 26R)* The Senior Naval Officer finding the Yal Saad so obdurate decided to call in H.' T *S*'Crocus' then on fcoute from Aden to the Persian ouif* h.P*S* 'Crocus' arrived on the 17th November, and it wan evidentlyevidently the appearance of these ships off their porta which made the Yal $aad see reason* They announced their submission but as they had not sont hostages the bombard— mont arranged for the 20th was commrjncod, but suspended as soon as the hostages arrived* The tribe accepted the terns of the Fusoat Govemnont, and docided to pay gf S500 for the two slave dealers* On the 21st and 22nd tonnor'^ry Custom Houses were erected at Khadra and Wuda?n # and peace was finally signed in the presence of the Political Agent on the 22nd November and 3000 of the fine paid and two Yal Saad FSheikhs sent ao hostages for the balance, less 4000 remitted by the Fusoat Government* It wl.11 be seen that the operations dragged on from the IBth October until the 22nd of November* This was most unexpected as the Muscat Government confidently hoped that the Yal saad would submit as soon as one of H.F.ships appeared on the scene. The Political Agent and I both consider there were good grounds for such a hope as the last time when the Yal saad wore rebellious the more throat of bombardment by the then Wazlr made thorn submit and nay their fl.no at once* I have noticed fair however recently on the Trucial coast/^bombardments are not regarded with so much dread as formerly, and that whereas formerly the threat of a bombardment, or at most the firing of one or two rounds was sufficient to make a Shei'di submit, now-a-days it has become necessary to carry out a fairly heavy bombardment to achieve the same result* I can only regard this as one of tho unexpected effects of tho war* In this case tho val saad were undoubtedly encouraged by tho fact that H^US.'Cyclamen' had to leave just after the first bombardment, but this could not be helped as the *lirltish General* was in groat danger* Tho political Agent considers that there la every reason to believe that a reasonably satisfactory andand lasting settlonont with the Yal Saad hnd been roadhod* I trust this is tho case and think there io good ground for hoping so* I havo little doubt that the Yal Saad woro nuoh impressed by the appearance of throe ships and v/ill not deairo to risk a similar experience for some time* (VHii Major ttae had an unexpectedly diffioult^lengthy task in settling this matter, and I consider that he deserves credit for bringing it to a satisfactory conclusion* T agree with Major Rae regarding tho valuable oo-oporation given by Commander V.Brandcn, senior *!aval Officer in the Persian GUlf* As I have reported to tho Government of India on previous occasions I havo always found Commander Brandon most helpful in all the cases in whtch I have had to ask for his assistance* I can also endorse ’*ajor Rao f s remarks about the help rendered by tho Cofcmandor and O^ieers of HaSUS^Kspiogle 11 • Before the receipt of this report I had in fact realised the valuable assistance render d by the se&amp;Lor Naval Officer, and expressed ny thanks to him and asked him to convey ny thanks to tho Commander of the 'Espioglo* • I trust the Government of India will endorse this. I rogret that there has boon some delay in the submission of this report, but as the affair dragged on so long I thought it best to await tho final report from tho Political Agent before submitting nine, instead of doing so by telegrams when I received telegraphic reports regarding the progress and conclusion of the operation from the Senior Naval Officer and the Political A^ont* I havo tho honour to be.

Reference diary entry Bo.172 dated the 3rd September 1 concerning the trouble at Swai&lt;i I cm not in a position to give you any news. I have been waiting for letters from Shaikh Rashil bin Uaais who probably arrived there couple of days ago. The quarrelnof the Yal 3aad is with the ^all alone who has been behaving for the last 3 years with great opporession towards these people. Knowing that the Yal Saad is about the most power- -ful tribe we have to deal with in the State it seemed good to me on hearing first rumour of trouble to write urgently to the Council of Ministers requesting them to meet at once and con- -eider th(3 situation. This was done in the presence of Mr*Thomas and the Dragoman and as a result Shaikh Rashid bin Usaia depart- -ed shortly after for Swalq with powers to dismiss the Wall should he be found to blame. As you are doubtless aware the ^al aad have given the State and the British Government a great deal of trouble in the past and any delay in coming to an agree- -ment with them might have been followed by very disagreeable consequences. I shall probably receive news fron Shaikh Rashid any day now. tfhen it comes I shall hasten to transmit it to you.
