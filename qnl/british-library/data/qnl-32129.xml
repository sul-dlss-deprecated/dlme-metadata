Government (subject &gt; the consent of the Sultan of Muscat) to establish a naval station in Muscat •ritory. Status of the Musandim Peninsula. 2. Before proceeding to an examination of the relevant treaty provisions and hr importance in the present connection it may be mentioned that, while in 02-04 some doubt was expressed as to whether the Musandim Peninsula (and so ? Khor Quwai and the surrounding territory) could properly be regarded as ling within the territory of the Sultan of Muscat, the result of investigations dertaken locally by Mr. Lorimer and embodied in Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the rsian Gulf was to show that the area must be regarded as falling within the •ritory of the Sultan. In the light of those investigations the British Counter .se submitted to the Hague Tribunal in 1905 in the Muscat Dhows Arbitration ited that “from lias Dibba to Tibba (Tibat), the coast forming the promontory of jsandim is claimed by the Sultan of Muscat, who has certainly before and since b4 exercised authority on that coast by his Yali and in other ways ; and his yhts on the coast are recognised by the Sheikh of Shargah and the Jowasmi.” iere have been no developments since 1905 to justify any reconsideration of this nclusion, and it is relevant that H.M. Governmeut have, so recently as 1930, sisted the Sultan of Muscat to assert his authority at Khassab. Treaty Engagements* 3. The treaty engagements of importance in the present connection are the flowing : — (а) British Treat} 7 of Commerce of 1839 with Muscat, Article 2. (б) Treaty of Commerce between France and Muscat, 1844, Article 3. (cj Anglo-French Declaration of 10th March 1862.

The following are the relevant extracts from the treaty engagements in lestion :— British Treaty of Cornmerce with Muscat of 1839. 5. Article 2 of the Treaty of Commerce of 1839 between the British Government td the Sultan of Muscat provides inter alia that “ British subjects shall be at )erty to purchase, sell, or hire land or houses in the dominions of His Highness e Sultan of Muscat. . . ” This treaty was replaced in 1891 by the revised treaty ferred to in paragraph 10 below.

Article 3 of the Treaty of Commerce between His Highness the Imam of uscat and the King of the French of November 1844, which is still in force, *ovides inter alia that “ the French shall be at liberty to purchase, sell, or rent nd, houses, or warehouses in the dominions of . . . Muscat.” The Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. [ 7. The Anglo-French Declaration of 10th March 1862 places on record that Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and is Majesty the Emperor of the French, taking into consideration the importance of Maintaining the independence of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and of His ighness the Sultan of Zanzibar, have thought it right to engage reciprocally to aspect the independence of these sovereigns. 3227 75 11.34 Lor.

The Declaration arose out of discussions which had reference primarily 1 1 the position of Zanzibar. Sultan Saiyid Said, who had ruled over both Musi, and Zanzibar, died in 1856 He had been anxious that his elder son, who l! u , acted as his deputy in Muscat, should succeed to the rulership of Oman, and younger son to the rulership of Zanzibar. Serious dliferences arose between rg u j tai] sons/ as the elder in virtue of his succession to Muscat also claimed feui^ ^ r , suzerainty over Zanzibar. These difficulties were finally composed by the int i ^ vention of Lord Canning, then Viceroy of India, who, in an arbitral Award. a pj eT\ 1 A *1 1 C ) /^ 1 J J „ M X Uv i- 'X .-x r-r » b'v I T '1 1/1 I \ / I /H /~V T /~VT l\/I T 1 ^ / 1 lx ren 2nd April 1861, decided that Zanzibar should be independent of Muscat and shoi^^. . pass to the younger son of Saiyid Said, but that it should pay to Muscat an anni r ‘ t y u ’ s subsidy of 40,000 crowns. L t t0 re ‘ 9. As both H.M. Government and France had on the date of the Awfhort tir separate treaties with the Sultan of Muscat, it was apparently considered necessfunion 1 that France as well as H.M. Government should recognise the separjtablishe independence of the two States. (It is noteworthy, however, that this does iference appear to have been thought necessary in the case of the United States of Ameritncluded which had been in treaty relations with Muscat since 1833.) But the immedii Muscat cause of the Anglo-(french Declaration of 1862 appears to have been the erection; Maurit the French of a large barrack at Zanzibar for occupation as a mission house a France hospital. The building could easily be occupied by troops, in which case it woi 14. T1 dominate the town, and H.M. Ambassador in Paris w r as accordingly instructed the An make enquiries on the subject of the French Government. M. de Thouveneltference reply gave satisfactory explanations and added that the Emperor of the Freaterest ir was ready to enter into a reciprocal engagement to guarantee the independence have bt the Sultan of Zanzibar. In the light of this intimation the Anglo-French Declaratiot the a{ under which both parties recognised the independence of Muscat and of Zanzibting as was prepared and signed at Paris on 10th March 1862. Despite the paramoionsul, b importance of Indian interests in Muscat, no prior reference was made to t Government of India, who first learnt that the Declaration had been concluc . _ in 1871. , , t about nrpose c British Treaty of Commerce of 19th March 1891. dnt polio 10. The Treaty of Commerce of 1839 referred to in paragraph 5 above, wterests ( replaced in 1891 by a revised treaty between Great Britain and Muscat (signed amdatio] 19th March 1891 and ratified in 1892), which is still in force. Article 4 of itered ur Treaty of 1891 provides inter alia that each of the High Contracting Parties “shven in t allow the subjects of the other to enter all ports, creeks and rivers with tliad unsuo vessels and cargoes . . . and ... to hire, purchase and possess housial shed warehouses, shops, stores and lands ” in each other’s dominions. 26.

Before proceeding to consider the importance in the present connectioi etu e . en ^ the engagements referred to above, and the interpretation which has been ph a( ‘ smce on the Declaration of 1862 in correspondence between the British and the Frei Governments, it may be convenient to refer very briefly to the relations of Fra ^ g. and of Great Britain with Muscat in the period from about 1770 to the present ti a ^ 2 )ceiJ3 rs here!} agementJ Muscat and France, 1770-1934. 1770-1891.

There appears to be no recorded French connection with Muscat (and certainly none of any importance) before the second half of the eighteenth century. Lor. I, 416, rimarily £ t p e secoru ] half of the eighteenth century intermittent relations were established 428 &gt; 430 &gt; ith Muscg^p t } )e ru lers of Muscat through the French Agents at Baghdad and in the 462 &gt; 468 - who ha^J aU ritius. Those relations were temporarily interrupted in 1781, but were n, and hL new ed in 1785. Relations remained generally friendly up to 1798, in which year etween gultan entered into an agreement with Great Britain under which he undertook led leudr C0 _ 0 perate with her against France. Overtures made by the French Government the inte^ 1799 we re rejected, and the Sultan in 1803 declined to receive a French mission Award C a p&gt;ench ’Consul who had been appointed to Muscat by Napoleon. In 1807, and shou| lowever&gt; a t rea ty was concluded between Muscat and the French Captain-General at t an ami u ^ au ntius. A revised treaty was substituted in 1808 and a French Consular Agent sent to reside at Muscat, where he remained until 1810. French influence, now for the Awa* shcat time predominant in Muscat, disappeared with the capture of Mauritius and d necessafteunion by Great Britain in 1810. From 1815 onwards relations were again re- e separaptablished. A commercial convention finally came into existence and (after prior is does n eference by the Sultan to H.M. Government) a regular Commercial Treaty was if Americ included with France in 1844. No French representative w r as, how r ever, accepted immedia n Muscat up to the death of Saiyid Said in 1850, and while the French authorities erection fc Mauritius appear to have attached importance to maintaining the connection house aif France with the Sultanate, those relations were of no special significance, se it won 14. There were no developments of importance between 1844 and the conclusion istructed of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, which was, of course, concluded without houvenel reference to Muscat, nor did the French Government show any signs of greater the Frencnterest in Muscat between 1862 and 1891. In 1874 a French Vice-Consul appears &gt;endence lo have been appointed to Muscat (under the terms of the French Treaty of 1844), declaratiolut the appointment never took effect. In 1881 a British subject (who was already f Zanzibaicting as Consul for the United States of America) was appointed to act as French paramoutonsul, but the period for which he held this post is not clear. ^ ffuJ 1891-1899. 15. From 1891 onwards there is a marked increase in French interest in Oman. Vt about this period France and Russia had entered into a combination for the Lor. I 547. mrpose of diminishing British influence in the Persian Gulf and of promoting a pint policy of their own in that region. In Oman the task of opposing British above, wfcterests devolved on France. In 1891 the French Government protested (without (signed ooundation) that the rule of succession to the Sultanate of Oman had recently been 4e 4 of tliltered under the advice of the Government of India. In 1893 an undertaking was rties “ shajiven in the French Chamber that a Vice-Consul should be established at Muscat, with thejnd unsuccessful endeavours were made by a French subject to obtain a site for a less houseual shed at Sur. 16. In 1894 a French Vice-Consul w'as appointed and took up his post. Between .894 and 1899 no effort was spared to increase .French prestige in Muscat at the Muscat. ,xpense of H.M. Government. In 1895 a French war vessel reached Muscat only te Sultan i few days too late to assist the Sultan in dealing with insurgents against his ‘ssors nevjuthority. In 1896 France protested against assistance given by H.M. Government the Britie the Sultan to re-establish his authority in Dhofar, on the grounds that it was endenciesjontrary to the Declaration of 1862. In 1897 they themselves offered the services die termsa French w 7 ar vessel, which were, however, declined, to suppress the Dhofar mnicated rebellion ; and in 1898 they acquired, without prior reference to H.M. Government, unicated \ site for a coaling shed in Muscat territory. The difficult situation which h 31 behresulted is described in more detail in the note on the Bunder Gisseh incident in pas contraparagraphs 30 to 36 below. Suffice it to say that after considerable diplomatic liscussion and as the result of the deliver} 7 of an ultimatum to the Sultan by d.M. Government, the Sultan in .1899 cancelled the lease and agreement was 34. *eached between the British and French Governments on the basis of the division annection^lween France and H.M.

The questions of the scope of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862,,.^^ relation to the issue of papers by France to subjects of the Sultan authorising tl ^ to fly the French flag, and the effect of the holding of such papers by Mus subjects on the Sultan’s jurisdiction were ultimately referred to the Hague Cc in 1905 by agreement between the French and British Governments. The Ha; ‘'T ^ H Tribunal on 8th August 1905 ruled that while prior to the ratification or ? ^ rs V Brussels Act of 1890 by France on the 2nd January 1892 the French Governni el to ° v had been at liberty to authorise Muscat vessels to fly the French flag, they f at \ re&lt; ? 1 ceased so to be entitled as from that date, save when the owner or fitter out of 311 , , } ship could establish that he had been considered and treated by France a e , reat protege prior to 1863 (a date chosen as one at which, in virtue of legislation by '^ omi . n&lt; Ottoman Court and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of m proteges was regulated and limited) ; that in these circumstances the right sh(] not be given in any future cases, although owners of vessels which, prior to h r '' lc -T’ V* had been authorised to fly the French flag should retain this authorisation so li ( she , 1: as it was renewed by France to the grantee, but that the authorisation could not ote( ‘ te( transferred to another vessel or owner, and that the flying of the French flag ud -4- It such authorisation conferred no rights on Muscat subjects as against the Sultan^ ste . nce ;casional 1905-1934. id H.M. 19. Between 1904 and 1912 the most important matter affecting Freirious p( interests in Muscat (where France continued to endeavour to maintain her sper contr position) arose out of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. The arms traffic riven int up to his death in 1907, conducted by a French citizen, M. Goguyer, who liie hintei in Muscat. Substantial French manufacturing firms were closely interested moreover, and, it being essential from the point of view of H.M. Government ihatader th( effective check should be placed upon the trade, a question of great poliayment, difficulty arose. The French declined various proposals made to them uieen mad which, in return for important territorial concessions elsewhere by H.M. Govi annual ment, France would abrogate her rights under her Commercial Treaty of ben und with Muscat and the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, thereby leaTOvermm H.M. Government liberty of action in the Sultanate. The question was time arms settled in 1912 independently of the French authorities by the issue c 25. T1 proclamation by the Sultan prohibiting the arms traffic. H.M Govermne%der co return gave certain compensation and guarantees to His Highness, includiumtinued guarantee of the support necessary to dispose of objections that might be rafth the i by France or other Powers. ' 3 descril 20. Great difficulty arose with France consequent on this settlement of&gt; rec lly r( arms traffic question, and it was only after long and difficult negotiations tliaPP^rs t( the early part of 1914 the French Government agreed to recognise the regulatt a regie which had been put in force at Muscat and the right of the Sultan to amend tNsauce regulations with the concurrence of H.M. Government. H.M. Government in rei-her area paid £64,495 as compensation to the interested F rench firms. 21. In 1913, on the accession of Sultan'laimur, the French Government, 1 had suggested that the two Governments should simultaneously recognise the i ruler, were informed that while H.M. Government, as they had already indica T] adhered to the Declaration of 1862, they had, in accordance with their usual prac^' ca ^ e ^ already taken steps to recognise the de facto ruler—more especially as they 'tood that the French Consul at Muscat only awaited the receipt of instruction^ &lt; British colleague to accord official recognition on behalf of France. No prc°^ c £ } received from the French authorities. re ^ escr 3227 The Ar his was5 the fact t 22. Between 1913 and the present day French interest in Muscat has steadily affic andtjclined, and since the War it has been of negligible importance. In the course of inconnecje Peace negotiations of 1919 the question of securing the abrogation of the ment ove^mmercial Treaty of 1844 and a free hand for Great Britain in Muscat was under rench. .nsideration, but does not appear to have been pursued. The French coal depot he numbe Muscat was relinquished in 1920; the number of Muscat dhows flying , the i Consulrench flag had in that year fallen to seven, of which five only belonged to Muscat y the Fr^bjects, and it is improbable that any Muscatis are at the present time entitled litical fly the French flag. The Consulate has now been closed for many years, though Teach of)t abandoned, and active French interest in the State is confined to the rights joyed by France under her Commercial Treaty of 1844 (which made it necessary 11 )0o cently to secure French concurrence in certain modifications proposed in the gscat tariff) and to a visit to Muscat and its waters by a French sloop, which i of 1862,, a ]|y takes place annually, lorismg tl s by Mus British Connection with Muscat, 1770 to 1934.

Government and Muscat, under which Muscat Gover 1 ^dcrtook to co-operate with Great Britain against the French, was signed in 1798. 1 , un iat treaty has, since the beginning of the nineteenth century, been supple- ' ^ .Rented by a large number of engagements. Of these the most important are F r ° ll &gt; 01 e Treaty of Commerce of 1839, which has since been replaced by the Treaty lathui^b a ^ onimerce 1891, and the Exclusive Agreement of 1891, to which reference e ition f rtia ^ e paragraph 3 above. In addition, Muscat has contracted engagements with . 'j I' ( j pi.

It is not unfair to say that through much of this period the continued be Sultan^ stence M usc ‘ lt has been possible only because of the moral, financial and, icasionally, the military or naval assistance lent her by the Government of India id H.M.

But for these she might have succumbed to the Wahabis at iting Freirious periods between 1800 and 1870 ; she would have found difficulty in retaining n her sper control in Dhofar in 1896-97 ; and the ruling house might well have been s traffic riven into the sea by the tribal rebellion of 1895 or by the fanatical Imam of er, who be hinterland and his Ibadhi followers between 1914 and 1922. Since 1873, crested moreover, when Zanzibar ceased to make the annual payment due to Muscat uent ihatader the Canning Award to which reference is made in paragraph 8 above, the reat poliayment, now known as the Zanzibar Subsidy, and amounting to Rs. 86,400, has them uisen made annually by the Government of India.

The interest of H.M.

It is in marked contrast ^ht be raith the interest taken in Muscat by the French Government, which may not unfairly 3 described as having been actuated largely by political motives which were not 3ment ofi rec ^ly related to the special interests of Muscat; and which in more recent times tions thafpears to have been based on the desire of the French Government to assert itself le regulat 1 a region in which British interests have long been predominant, or to use the amend tfffisauce value of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 to secure concessions in lent in reiser areas of the international field from H.M.

But before dealing in greater detail irnment, 1 nise the i idy indica s they iui ith discussions to which that incident gave rise, it may be placed on record structioiD at ex i s tence of the Declaration has for many years bulked largely in British r( plicy in this area. The circumstances in which the Declaration was concluded 1 re described in paragraphs 8-9 above ; it will be seen that it was made without 3227 B6 10.2.97.

In 1890 an India Office proposal for the establishment of a protectoratef'ou id U Muscat was rejected by the Foreign Office partly because of the existence of WU erslii Declaration ; in 1891 a French protest, based on the Declaration, was receifter con against alleged British activities. In 1894 the Sultan was advised to plead u-obablv terms of the Declaration should France claim to grant protection to French %e expo holders who were Muscat subjects ; in 1895 the proposal for the establishment or a reg protectorate was revived by the Government of India, who thought that it migbeino- ho possible to obtain French consent in connection with the arrangements then conteie Muse; plated in regard to Madagascar, but H.M. Government considered that there was prospect of this. In 189b the French were officially informed of assistance propo$ to be given to the Sultan to maintain himself in Dhofar, and were assured t! the action proposed in support of His Highness implied no intention of establish any protectorate over Muscat. The assistance in question was, however, follow 30. T in May 1896 by a protest by the French Ambassador against unilateral action* 1 ..' X this nature, in reply to which the Foreign Secretary assured him that there was intention “of establishing any protectorate over Muscat or any departure from . engagements undertaken in the Declaration of 10th March J862.” In 1897 grant of armed assistance to the Sultan in Dhofar was again approved et ] e ^ r H.M. Government, but with a specific warning by the Secretary of State for 1m P f to the Political Resident of the importance of bearing in mind the Declaration 11 !,. jV 1862. In 1898 a proposal for assisting the Sultan by taking control of his Cust^o^ei-inr was rejected by H.M. Government on the ground that actual and direct comroCH!!!!! j!

Grant to France by the Sultan of a Coaling Station. 30. The history of the Bunder Gisseh incident of 1899 is as follows. In the jirly part of 1899 a French war vessel visiting Muscat (at which, as stated in aragraph 16 above, France was then represented by a Vice-Consul) secured from ie Sultan of Muscat an undertaking to grant a coaling station to the French The terms of the agreement, which was dated 7th March 1898, 'j 10 Government. 11 ^ ’'ere as follows : “ Be it known to all that w t o have given to the French Government approved pj ace for coal on the coast at a distance from dwelling houses where it would not ute lor int lir k them, outside Muscat, a piece of land about the size of a godown in one of the eclaiatiou^ves dependent on Muscat as a mark of favour and respect to the great French lls ^ lls ’ 0 rovernment on account of the friendship and concord.” It will be seen that this set controlg reemeil t ) which is in quite general terms and does not specify the location of the bet with depot, makes no reference to fortifications or to the flying of a flag. the Bunc eclaration Cancellation of the Grant consequent on pressure from H.M. Government. 31. On the news that this concession had been granted becoming public roperty, the Sultan was at once called on for an explanation of his action in granting Icoal depot to the French in violation of his Agreement with Great Britain of 1891 lows :— paragraph 11 above). His Highness replied that he had merely given the French, , the Brit® a ^o 11 friendship, coaling facilities similar to those already enjoyed by influence I'M* Government (see paragraphs 39-40 below) and declined to communicate the inconsist£ xt °f concession. Strong further pressure was brought to bear on the Sultan, bar] Subsi^ n 10th February 1899 he informed the French Vice-Consul that he was being reach 0 f pressed by H.M. Government to withdraw the grant as being a violation of the igreement of 1891. The Consul, in writing, entirely declined to recognise that ii punishilo re ement, as being in contravention of the Declaration of 1862, and stated that rements wibimrid an y difficulties arise between the Sultan and H.M. Government “I will 1 Declaratir ve ^ iem removed in accordance with the Treaty of 1862.” On 13th February overeimib* 16 Sultan cancelled the concession. On the 15th February, faced with an r w ph it Itimatum, coupled with a threat of bombardment failing a public cancellation, he p treaty oF rot ' e to French Vice-Consul that he could no longer resist the pressure of &gt;t necessaJ-M-- Government, and he enclosed a copy of the Agreement of 1891 for M. Ottavi’s deposin^ orma ^ on - ^ Vice-Consul, in a written reply, intimated that he had already Dcndent °3ade it clear that he could not recognise the Agreement of 1891, which was in ’ ontravention of the Declaration of 1862, and that he could not accept the a^Darficiil ance ^ a ^ on ^ 8' ran l which the Sultan had made.

He called to mind the engagement we had entered into in 1862 i-, es t a bl to trench on the independence of the Imam of Muscat and reminded me also of t xam i ne arrangement into which Muscat had entered in the time of Louis Philippe to all( iatter f e all Frenchmen to hold land, or receive leases or alienations of land in the territc of the Sultan. He apprehended that the action of the French Government in taki 35. 0 a coaling station was within their powers. J said that the matter had been iu jecretarj hands of the Indian Government, and I was not absolutely certain of the positi?reaty o in which it stood, but 1 would enquire. But it appeared to me, upon his oerritory, statement of it, that France had gone somewhat beyond her treaty rights. lf;rant of State accepts the lease of the territory of another potentate it practically interfe|ght. I in the independence of that potentate and the integrity of his dominions. We ha aent 1 had sundry examples to illustrate that proposition recently. According to establish reading of the engagement of 1862, it is not competent for France, as a State, ufferano accept a lease from the Imam of Muscat, because so far as that lease extends it lat interference with the independence of a sovereign. She can no more accept a lea ae hnan than she can accept an alienation. This view, of course, would not apply to a lea given to a French citizen in his private capacity. I would, however, enquire in the matter, which I did not think was of very great importance, but my impress! is that a coaling station leased by the French Government from the Imam . 3(3. A Muscat would be an infraction of the Declaration of 1862.” LM. Go ettled ii 34. On 22nd February, a week after the public cancellation of the Freuo the Su concession by the Sultan, M. Gambon was again received by Lord Salisbury. “ br coali complained very earnestly of the excessive action which he thought the Admiif the gi had pursued towards the Imam of Muscat and of the publicity which had bepndition given to this affair, which induced the newspapers to adopt a very disagreeablnd sho tone towards the French Government. ... I replied to him that I had examinortificati into the matter since he spoke to me last time and I was compelled to adhere to troice in view which I had laid before him. It seemed to me that the Treaty of 1862, whirere ent bound both France and England to respect the independence of the Imam of Musc^reat B: was seriously threatened if either Power, acting as a sovereign State, could tairivilege from the Imam a lease of any portion of his territory. If it could be done forourse of small piece of ground, it could be done over a large piece ; and after what h taken place in China it was impossible to say that the practical independence the Imam would not, in regard to such portions of territory, be impaired. “His Fxcellency declined entirely to admit my interpretation of the Treaty bi setting that question aside, he thought that our view on that subject, which vv; certainly open to discussion, need not have been asserted by a threat bombardment. I mentioned, and 1 reiterated the opinion in order that he might be under i doubt with respect to it, that France had so far violated the Treaty by taking; lease of a portion of the territory 7 of the Imam. I quite admitted that the affair hi not been conducted as quietly as I think it well might have been. ... I ad mitt that in the matter of sentiment he had a grievance, though in the matter substance our action was entirely right. I also told him that we had for a gre number of years special engagements with the Imam which involved some paymen of money on our side and a very rigid prohibition of the alienation of his ov territory on his side. The existence of these stipulations must be taken into accoui if the action ol our authorities had seemed to be rather summary, and they hi undoubtedly been actuated by the fear lest the lease which France had obtain! should only be a step on the road to the obtaining of a portion of the Imaii; littoral in permanent possession. Ilis Excellency assured me that any such designs were very far from t contemplation of his Government and he was quite willing to make any declaratii which was necessary to place the innocent intentions of his Government beyot ooubt. But he asked me whether it would not be possible, after such declaration had been made, to provide in some manner for the establishment of a coali: station, which was really a matter of great necessity to France. He said that suggestion which I had made on a previous occasion, and repeated again, that might be taken in the name of a brenoh citizen, was made difficult on the presf occasion because the English newspapers had appeared to dictate such a course a somewhat threatening manner, and he thought that the same end might be arrh at if trance formally disclaimed any inference from her possession of a coal def 37. 1 (a) (b)9 am site could be construed to be derogatory to the independence of the Imam or in 1862 ih) establish any French right to the littoral. . .

T impressic le Imam 36. After lengthy further discussion between the French Government and LM. Government and examination of alternative sites, the matter was finally ettled in July 1900 by the grant to France by H.M. Government (after reference the Freuo the Sultan) of one-half of the area which they had hitherto themselves enjoyed mry. “ br coaling purposes in the Makalla cove in Muscat harbour. The conditions he Admirf the grant were that the area in question should be held on precisely the same h had be&lt;onditions as the British area, i.e. that no political or territorial rights of any lisagreeablnd should be involved and no right given to fly the national flag or to erect d exam mortifications. H.M. Government successfully insisted on having a determining Ihere to tfoice in the question of the site to be granted to France, the argument that they L862, whifere entitled to ensure that that site was in no way superior to the site held by nofMuscJreat Britain, since “France, under the Treaty of 1862, had no right to any , could tairivilege which England had not a right also to possess,” being employed in the done forourse of the discussions. 3r what hf •endence t 37. The main points which emerge from the incident are :— {a) While the acquisition of a lease of land by a private individual for use as a coaling station would not constitute a violation of the Declaration of 1862 and would be permissible under the French (Jommercial Treaties of 1844: and the British Commercial Treaty of 1891, acceptance of a lease or cession of Muscat territory by either Government would be an infraction of the terms of the Declaration. (b) H.M. Government based their representations to the Sultan on his violation of the Exclusive Agreement of 1891. Vis-d-vis the French, on the other hand, and in Parliament, H.M. Government took their stand on the Declaration of 1862, the India Office, while emphasising that the Agreement of 1891 “ conferred exceptional rights upon the British Government ”, agreeing with the Foreign Office that it was impossible to found any argument on that “to which France was not a party.” That Agreement has never been officially communicated by H.M. Government to the French Government, and the French Vice-Consul declined to recognise it when it was officially communicated to him by the Sultan on the ground that it contravened the Declaration of 1862. On the other hand, H.M. Govern ment in dealing with the French made some play (c/. paragraph 34 above) with their special treaty relations with the Sultan, and recorded their financial assistance to him and the fact that he had undertaken not to alienate his territory. (c) H.M. Government felt unable to resist a French claim for precisely equal treatment; but were able to require that the area attributed to the French should be attributed on conditions identical with those on which the British area was held, viz. that no political or territorial rights were acquired in it and that the national flag should not be flown or defences erected.

Up to the year 1875 the Government of India used to stock their coal 1 ai W ev three godowns in Muscat, and the British-India Steam Navigation Company had[ a p^i ce small coal shed in the Makalla cove in Muscat harbour, for which no rent was p a idividua An annual rent of Rs. 174 was paid by Government for one godown, the oth 44 ] having been given rent free by the Sultan. Two fires, which endangered the safe v a Dr } v of the town of Muscat, having broken out in the coal godowns in 1875, Saiyid Tuw^.j.q offered to allow H.M. Government to build a godown at Makalla next to the Britia|$9_l9( India coal shed, and the Government coal was accordingly stored there. In 18 0 nsisteij the British-India Steam Navigation Company broke up their coal depot at Musc 0 actioi and sold the materials of the shed by auction, the site being resumed by the Sultfoe Suita who handed it over to the Political Agent for the use of Government.

I Maced c Conclusion. ’ecognis 41 Prom the note above it will be seen that the French interest in Muscat is lorres PO long standing and dates back to the eighteenth century ; that it is based essential- elt unal on the Commercial Treaty of 1844 and the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862; fthat Ag that it has been of active importance only between 1890 and 1914, although t^overnu Treaty provisions referred to still remain in force. Any sentimental attachni6^ ec ^ ara ^ based on long historical association apart, the French have in the past, even duriP-^- the period of the Entente Cordiale and immediately prior to the Great War, sho'' 0 ail y P themselves fully alive to the “ nuisance value ” of their position in Muscat; a: rile P oi f oetween 1908 and 1912 they declined offers made by H.M. Government of a ptesti ungenerous territorial compensation elsewhere in return for an abrogation of thf^^anc 1 ' treaty rights. AVhile Trance might be expected not to raise difficulties so lor? 6 as the importance of any anchorage or rights acquired is minimised, and long as H.M. Government are in a position to claim that no infringement of t 46. 1 Declaration of 1862 is involved, it is pnma facie unlikely, even now, when (claim tc many years her active interest in Muscat has been slight, that her consent to tto acqui: abrogation of the Declaration of 1862 or of the Commercial Treaty of 1814 coirights v be secured without long discussion and a quid pro -quo which might territori; disproportionately large. ^ or the ei11 1, when tl terest in it nt that tl tiemselves Deceml mment of; lififh Gove 42. On this assumption, the questions for settlement appear to be— (a) the extent to which, and the conditions on which, H.M. Government are at liberty, having regard to the construction which has been placed on the Declaration of 1862, to acquire rights in respect of the use of a site in Muscat territory for naval purposes; (b) whether such conditions are capable of fulfdment. 43. As regards the first of these points, it would be open to a British subject in hcrV^^ 8 P r i va f e capacity (as distinct from the British Government) to acquire land for i • ^%e as a harbour or a station under the terms of Article 3 of the British Commercial ;’ 0 W llc . Veaty of 1891. H.M. Government themselves suggested to the French in 1899 U11C1 \at the difficulty which had arisen over Bunder Gisseh should be solved by the cquisition of a site for a coaling shed by a French subject, and the suggestion r as rejected at the time by the French Government professedly only because it r ould not have been consistent with their prestige to accept it in the light of the -19,14. Terences which had been made to it in the English Press. There are, however, their coal 1 au y event ’ 0 ^ v ^ 0ns difficulties about the acquisition of an area which would in mpanv h a ij rac ^ ce llse d ou ly or even predominantly for naval purposes by any private ent was ^dividual. n, the oth 44. Xf ) 0 n the other hand, rights acquired are acquired by Governme?it and not ed the safty a private individual, the construction of the Declaration of 1862 at once becomes Saiyid Ta! 3a t er i a p .The construction placed on that Declaration in the discussions of ) the Britijg99_i9()0 described above was that neither signatory of the Declaration can, ‘re. In 18 on sisteutly with its terms, obtain a lease or cession of Muscat territory; that &gt;ot at Musc 0 action is permissible which would be an infringement of the independence of y the Sult'he Sultan (compare on this point the opinion expressed by the Law Officers in a As stated ifferent connection in 1899, paragraph 28 above) ; and that in these circumstances made over 0 acquire territorial or sovereign rights over property which they use in Muscat, Governm(o fly the national flag, or to erect defensive works, on such property would be a iolation of the terms of that Declaration. (The coal sheds which H.M. Government uirohasedpve held in Muscat since 1874 have accordingly been held on sufferance only ; the Truar T p ia ti ona l d a £ has not been flown, defensive works have not been erected, and no whether t eriator ^ or sovere ^ n rights in the area have been conveyed. The coal sheds held r he merA^ France from 1900 to 1920 were held on the same basis. Of the other sites at The Politi :&gt;resent 0CCU Pi e d by H.M. Government, the use of the site of the civil aerodrome nt a ortir ^ wa d ur has been granted by the Sultan, who will receive an annual rent in h coal she( eturn ’ use not con dned to British subjects or aeroplanes ; the British flag 11 hoisted 8 understood uof t0 be flown ; and liability for protection rests with the Sultan, n hoisted fc 10 position in regard to the strategic aerodromes is not clear; but it would appear v ^ n t be^ ia ^ Sultan, while retaining full sovereignty, has granted the use of the sites in o^h^R 4l ues ^ on rent b*ee, tbe British flag not being hoisted, and defensive works not being ' Greeted.) 45. It is open to question, in the second place, whether, on the construction Maced on the Declaration in 1899, H.M. Government are not committed to •ecognising that either signatory can claim rights under the Declaration Muscat isi° rres PO n ding to those which may be acquired by the other. H.M. Government d essential 6 ^ unable in 1899 to plead the Exclusive Agreement of 1891 against the French; f 1862 • l^bat Agreement has at no stage been officially communicated to the French ilthomh fov eminent (and a French statement to the Sultan that it is inconsistent with the attaclirae^ ec l arat ion of 1862, and cannot be recognised, remains on record); and even fluriP-M. Government urged in the course of the discussions that France has no right War sli( ri0 aa y privilege which England has not also a right to possess (paragraph 36 above). Muscat * afhe point is of some importance because of the risk that the French, for reasons ml of a p-P res tige or from a desire to embarrass, either now or at a later stage, might tion of tlA dvance a c l a i m to a corresponding concession which (despite the provisions of ties so k^be Exclusive Agreement of 1891) it might be difficult for the Sultan or for . 0( | W anf ] H.M. Government to resist. ment of t 46. From the above it would appear that H.M. Government might reasonably v, when blaim to be entitled, consistently with their existing international engagements, isent to tto acquire rights in the Khor Quwai from the Sultan of Muscat, so long as those 1814 coirights were without prejudice to the sovereignty of His Highness, conveyed no mmht territorial or sovereign rights, and did not involve the flying of the national flag or the erection of defensive works. There need be no question of any acquisitionof territorial or sovereign rights, and no difficulty need arise over this. So far defence is concerned, it would seem reasonable to suggest that no exception cot be taken to the equipment of the staff of the station with rifles, &amp;c., for ordin £ purposes of self-defence, or to the building of boundary walls ; while the knowled that the station was visited at regular intervals by the sloops of the Persian Gt Squadron would seem likely to deter surrounding tribes from making raids upon The question of the flying of the flag is one of greater difficulty. Having rega to the visit paid annually to Muscat by a French sloop and to the fact that t existence of the new station must become known to the international shippi using the Gulf, it seems unlikely that if the flag were in fact flown it would esca notice. Even if a flag other than the National flag w'ere flown, and if the flagst were not fixed in the ground, it might be open to France to argue that the presea of a flag was only consistent with the existence of a naval station or depot of su a character as to constitute an infringement of the Declaration of 1862. 47. A difficulty which should not be overlooked in connection with t acquisition of the site is perhaps that discussed in paragraph 45 above. It perhaps relevant in this connection that under the Red Line Agreement Muse falls within the sphere of the I.P.C., which contains a French group which t in the past shown itself extremely anxious to obtain a share in any oil developme in the Persian Gulf area. Should oil at some time in the future be found the Sultan’s dominions and be exploited by the I.P.C., French interest in Muse might very well revive and the French Government be glad to take # advanta of the existence of a British naval station to make a corresponding demand the Sultan.

(E 6766/2850/34) Foreign Office,S.W.l. 13th November 1934. Immediate. My dear Gilbert, ;/e have read with great interest your memorandum on Khor Kuwai, the latest print version of which you sent me in your letter P.Z.68x1/34 of 7th November. Malkin has gone very thoroughly into the legal aspect of the question, and I cannot do better than send you the enclosed copy of a minute which he wrote on the subject on 10th November. 2. This minute, howeber, needs a word of explanation. Before Malkin write it he raised the preliminary question of what it was intended should happen to the station or depot in the event of our being engaged in war in such circum stances that the ordinary rules of neutrality would be applicable in Muscat. His point was that if it were proposec to use the place in war time in a way which would be in consistent with its position in neutral territory, it would then be almost impossible to contend that we were 'maintain ing the independence' of the Sultan of Muscat in accordance with the Anglo-French declaration of 1862. 3. In rejbly to this enquiry I explained in the first place that the proposal was to use Khor Kuwai as an alternative to Henjam ; that it had always been recognised and admitted that we should not be able to use Henjam in time of war, Persia being a neutral; and that, in these circumstances, I did not -think it need materially aitect the immediate issue if it should turn out that the use of Khor Kuwai was subject in this respect to the same limita tions as those which apply to our present use of Henjam. Secondly / J.G.Laithwaite Esq.- 2 - Secondly I explained that I found it hard to believe that a situation would in fact arise where we should be at war and Muscat would be a neutral. Much would of course depend on the attitude of France, but it was hardly conceivable that in the event of our bein^; at war France would be so unbenevolent a neutral as to invoke the Anglo-French declaration of 1862 in order to prevent our making use of a depot on Muscati territory. 4. The first two paragraphs of Malkin’s minute should be read in the light of this explanation. You will see that he is disposed to think that the neutrality ^oint may be regarded as not very material for our present purposes, unless there is a possibility of the French asking us our intentions on this point in the event of their wfc wishing to question the legality of our establishing the station. This might of course be embarrassing as we might then find ourselves obliged to enter into some inconvenient commitment regarding the use of Khor Kuwai in time of war in order to obtain French acquiescence in our establishment of the proposed station in time of peace. 5. You will see from Malkin’s minute that he is quite clear that, 5u view of the very unfortunate line which was taken by Lord Salisbury in 1899, as described in paragraphs 33 to 36 of your memorandum, we shall in any case have to be very care ful, if we decide to use Khor Kuwai, to avoid any kind of formal lease, to make sure that the conditions of tenure do not go beyond those governing the use of the coal sheds (now converted into an oil depot) referred to in paragraphs 39 and 40 of your memorandum, and to avoid flying any kind of flag. In these circumstances it may be that the best course will be to trust that the apparent insignificance of our arrangements at Khor Kuwai will prevent the French from raising the politi cal question involved, and to say nothing at all* about what we propose to do. But before we decide to recommend such a line /-a- y® ■ line I think it will be necessary to put all the facts before our Ambassador in laris and ascertain his views* 6. I think the best plan will probably now be to have an informal interdepartmental discussion with the admiralty on the lines contemplated in conclusion (b) of the meeting of the Ministerial Middle .^ast Sub-Committee of 25th October as soon as you and the Admiralty have had time to consider the various questions raised in Malkin*s minute. tfe can tnen also discuss the question of what is to bo said to Sir George Glerk. 7. Meanwhile I am asking our Library to dig out the 1890 correspondence referred to in paragraphs 33 to 35 of your memorandum and in paragraph 5 of Malkin's minute} but I fear this is unlikely to give us much assistance. 8. I am sending copies of this letter to Seal at the Admiralty, to the members of the kiddle i^ast (Official) Sub committee, and to Hind. Yours ever, sd. G.W.RendelCopy, (E 6765/2850/34). I think that in the event of wur being involved in a war in which Muscat was neutral and the ordinary rules of neutrality were applicable, we could not, consistently with the Declaration of 1862, nuke use of the proposed station of depot in a manner which would be inconsistent with those rules; and consequently that if we were to acquire the station on terms which entitled us to use it in such a way in war time, we should not have a good defence to a French complaint that our action was in violation of our obligations under the Declaration. There seems to be no doubt that we must regard Muscat as being (and differing in this way from Bahrain) an independent state and one which is capable of being neutral in a war in which we were engaged. The position might be different if tnere were a treaty of alliance between the two countries, but no such treaty exists, and this being so, it appears to me that for us to induce the Sultan to undertake to allow us to use a base on his territory in war time in a manner which, as an independent and netural ruler, he is bound to prevent, cannot be regarded as consistent with our under taking to 'respect his independence'. 2. It may, however, be said that all that we want at the moment is the right to use the proposed station in peace time; that if and when war breaks out, the circumstances map be such that either the ordinary rules of neutrality do not apply (because the war as a 'League war', or because Muscat became an ally), or the French either could not or would not object to our doing what we liked; that in making the proposed arrangements with the Sultan there is no need to say anything about the position in war time, and that this question can therefore be left out of account for the moment. This is in a sense quite true; a possible difficulty is that if the French/French were to raise a question under the Declaration of 1862 and were to mention the neutrality point, we should have to state our intentions, and might have to give assurances which would oblige us not to use the place in war time in a manner which would be inconsistent with the rules of neutrality. 3. Considering the matter on the basis that we should not use the place in war time in a manner inconsistent with the rules of neutrality, the position appears to me to be as follows. If one looks merely at the text of the 1862 Declara tion, I do not think that, provided the conditions laid down in the first sentence of paragraph 46 of the India Off! ce memorandum were observed, and that, generally sneaking, precau tions were taKen to avoid anything which might look like an infringement of the independence of the Sultan, the acquisition of the proposed rights would be inconsistent with our oblige- tions under thcat instrument. Thexx mere fact that a state allows another state to make use of a small portion of its territory in peace time for purposes such as those now in question does nfct involve any infringement of the independence of the former state, and we should cert inly not admit that the privileges which we now enjoy in Henjom and Basidu are in any way inconsistent with Persian independence. The difficulty which arises results from the interpretation which we put upon the Declaration in connexion with the Bunder-Gisser incident of 1899. It is difficult to deny that the French could maintain with great plausibility that we were now doing precisely what we had successfully, on the ground of the I Declaration, objected to their doing in 1899, since the rights which we now propose to acquire are at any rate not less than those involved in the grant which they obtained of a coaling statidn from the Sultan. I need not develop this point in detail, since the considerations which arise are obvious. 4. /5 . / 4 On the other hand it appears that for many years before the incident in question we had occupied a site in Muscat harbour as a coaling depot, and that the incident was ultimately settled by the transfer to the French Government of half the area in question. It must therefore be assumed that there is nothing inconsistent with the Declaration in the use of an area in Muscat by either of the governments concerned as a coaling de^ot, provided that the conditions on which we and the French held the area£ in question are complied with. If therefore it were possible to to arrange matters that (mutatis mutandis) the conditions in which we use the proposed depot were identical with those which applied to our occupation of the area in Muscat harbour, I think that we should have a good defence to any French complaints. Since we committed ourselves in 1899 to the view that neither j-arty to the Declaration could take a lease of any portion of Muscat territory, it would be essential to avoid anything that could be regarded as a lease, and it would certainly be necessary to comply with the other conditions stated in paragraph 36 of the India Office memorandum. General ly speaking, it would be necessary to minimise as much as possible the importance of the rights which we obtained, and to avoid at any cost any suggestion that we were acquiring anything like a naval base. Sven so, it is impossible to guarantee that if the French wanted to make trouble they could not put up a .plausible case though I think that if the above conditions were complied with we should have a good answer} the question of how much, if any, trouble the French would make would, no doubt, depend on political considerations. In this connection I note with interest that the coal-sheds in Muscat harbour have now been transferred to the R.A.F. for use an an oil depot, though as this only happened in June last it may be that the French have not yet become aware of it.-4- 5. I should perhaps say that I have had to consider the point about the Bunder Gisser incident entirely on the basis of the account given in paragraphs 30 to 4u of the Incia Office memorandum. It is possible that a detailed eacamination of the discussion between ourselves and the French Government might reveal other points which might be material ? though this is perhaps not very likely, since the discussions on the question of the principle between Lord Salisbury and M.Gambon seem to have been entirely verbal. 6. As regards the point made in paragraph 45 of the India Office memorandum, it is plain that any rights which H.M. Government can, consistently with the 862 Declaration, acquire from the Sultan can equally, consistently with that Declaration be acquired by France. It does not follow th-t as a matter of law the Sultan is bound to grant to France any rights which he may grant to us. ^part from the 'Exclusive Agreement' of 1891, on which we cannot rely as against France, the Sultan is free to grant or refuse such rights as he may think fit, and the question whether he could refuse corresponding rights to the French, and whether we could support him in such a refusal, is a political and not a legal question, though in this connection the statement which we apparently made to the French in 1899 that 'France under the Treaty of 1862 had had 'no fight to any privilege which England txmms. not a right 'also to possess' (paragraph 36 of the India Cifice memorandum) is one which is obviously capable of being turned against us.CONFIDENTIAL.

One rather important point strikes me. In paragraph 2 of the Record, Rendel renarxed: 'As he saw the position, the use of Khor Quwai was in the nature of a precaution. The real substitute for the existing depot and recreational centre at Kenjam would be at Bahrain, and Khor ^uwai would be in the nature of an auxiliary depot only, for use not so much in ordinary times as in certain possible emergen cies.' This is also personally how I see the position. 3. On the other hand the Admiralty view, as expressed in paragraph 3 of the Record, is that they propose to transfer to Rhor ^uwai rather than to Bahrain many ox the facilities at ^resent existing at Henjam. No doubt there are good reasons for this but the following are the comments which occur to me:- (_•) It is generally agreed that it is desirable not to let the proposed depot appear more important than can be avoided, but the larger the depot at Khor Quwai obviously the more important it will appear and the less easy it will be / J.G.Laithwaite Lsquire, The India Office, London.- 2 - V-l be to reply to any objections put forward by tLe French Government.

In this connection I may point out that His Highness the Sultan is a very shrewd individual and before giving permission he will probably want from me the exact details of what we require.

Lambert ) I® The meeting wliioh v;as called in accordance with conclusion (b) of the Middle East Ministerial Sub-Committee meeting of October £5tli (copy attached -» Annex A)s&gt; had before it a memorandum prepared in the India Office (P.3 .6811/34 of IfOffember 22nd) on the question of the possibility of establishing a British naval station at Khor ouwai in Muscat territory, in the light of the Anglo- French declaration of 1062 respecting the independence of the sultan cf Muscat and subsequent events, and a copy of a private letter from Mr. Rondel to Mr. Laithwaite (E 6765/ 2850/34 of November 13th) enclosing a copy of a minute by Sir william Malkin upon certain legal aspects of this •que stion.8. in. began by explaining that although the j'or-ei^n oi'fice haa felt obliged to direct the attention of the Admiralty to certain restrict Iona upon any use Tjhifch roirht be made of Muscat territory for naval purposes, in p«:rtioul9r those connected. T?ith the flying of a flag and the iw n of the territory in time of war, they had not c one so with any intention of dissuading the Admiralty from using Muscat territory On that account; on the contrary they wished to encourage any scheme which would facilitate the removal of the naval depdt from Renjara and hoped that the Admiralty would bo able 'to agree to the move to Khor ouwai in cpite of these restrictions. As he saw the position, the use of Ahor Quwai was in the nature of a precaution. The real substitute for th® existing dendt and recreational centre at Hen jam would be at Bahrain, and Khar Quwai would be in the nature of an auxiliary depOt only, for use not so much in ordinary times as in certain possible emergencies. The important point was presumably that such preparations should be made as would ensure that the auxiliary depdt was available if and when such an emergency at'one, lie therefore suggested that very- little would be required in the way of building, and that poseibly the mooring of one or two oil barges in the anchorage with some provision for the storage of water and the disembarkation of stores would be sufficient, it was clearly desirable not to let the proposed depdt appear more important than could be avoided; and apart from the fact that the flying of a flag would be likely to lead to difficulties.•••fl . o-Ivieo with the French, it might well prove an a&amp;v vntag8 from the point of view‘of the navy itself to avoid the public‘ty which a flag would give to the new establishmentt Z. oowmim'l 1ICIC301T and MB. SEAL explained that it was not entirely accurate to say that the depot at Khor Quwai was only renul '-d with a view to possible emergencies* Even in ordinary ti; eg it e.cule probably be more convenient for the Admiralty to transfer to Kh'or Q.uwai rather than to 3 ah r ai n m on y o f t h e f ac ill ties at present e x is ting at Ken.j'r) : including ;jo&gt;st of the store-houses, which in their turn would involve the provision of ac commod at io n for the tally clerk (Mr. pelles) anc] coolies and possibly something in the nature of a pier or causeway as well e The Admiralty had not as - yet, however, gone vary deeply into the details of their requirements and would have to consult the senior Naval Officer on a variety of details. 4. on the particular question of the flag* MB. BiUBEl drew attention to the statement made by the First Lord of the Admiralty at the Ministerial meeting of October E6th (V.oFo (ti ) 8 th meeting) that it was not intended to fly the flag until wrench concurrence to the use of Khor Quivai had b-en obtained* COMM-HDKR DICKSON explained that if any flag were flown, it world not be the Union jack but the yhite Ens. gn- which when flying on shore denotes naval ownership but not territorial sovereignty* The Foreign Office representatives pointed out however, that this distint 1-i-on 'would be lost both on the French Government and•.* *and the sultan. The vlcn nos also capreosed that whila there d ;ht ob f j'otlono to oeaaing to fly the fle^ when onoe th- pr notice h.d &gt;cen eetabliohed, ae at Hen Joan, there could hr: 10 cbjootion to omitting to establish the proa* ice at an entirely iwr depot, in any oaee, the Henjoan flag v/ould fc? t ?rra&lt; to Bahrain, which would be the formal and principal substitute for irenjam. in the light of this consideration, the Admire!ty representative8 indioated that, sublet to the views of the senior larval Officer, they would feel able to roaouaend that the flying of a flag, although denirab.r under the oonditione obtaining in the rersion / Tulf, need not be regarded as absolutely necessary fsee conoluaion 1). 5. ^he meeting then turned to what was admitted to bo the much more Jnjyort&amp;nt rruastion of the possible use of r.uscat territory by His uajestys forces in time of war. Itfi. ‘; I pointed out that one very important point to remember in this oonnoslon ^as that there could be no possibility, notwithstanding the precedent of the last war, of our using a depot on Persian territory in any future war. Khor otiT/ai was at most a substitute for Hcnjam, and in moving there, the navy would be placing themselves in no worse a position th;n ,he;; were in at present. The position at Khor auwai could not possibly be worse in this respect than that at Hen jam, while it might - e.g. if prance or Unseat were ellies - be very much better. Mi?. SEAL suggested that the difficulties which might arise in time of war if nis Majesty's oovernmsnt were to compromise the neutrality....j neutrality of the sultan by using his territory as a base uere largely illusory. Ihe only states who would have ^any right to complain were the states at war with Great Britain! and, providing that the latter was able and willing to protect the sultan from the consequences of their resentment, the question would have no practical significance. It seamed uniilie 1:/ that the ifrench Government would go out of their ?;ay to complain, and if they did so he dici not see that even under the Declaration of 1862, they had any locus standi . UR . HEIIDSL thought that the question was not quite so simple, it was possible to conceive a war between Great Britain and, vsay, japan, in which France and Muscat were both neutrals; in such a war the i?rench Government might bo anxious for one reason or another to ensure that Muscat remained strictly neutral and was not exposed to any risk of occupation by our enemies as a result of our violation of its neutrality. In such a case France might have a legitimate grievance if we used I'hor ouwai while Muscat was neutral. There were in fact possible contingencies in which other powers night attach great import an co to the 'sterilisation” of Muscat in time of w&amp;* . He agreed, however, that the difficulty was not very substantial. Mil. LA ITH WAITE said that so far as the India office were able to judge there could he thought bo little euestion that in the event of a major war in which this country was concerned and in which the position of Muscat was of importance e ither....il either because of the existence of naval• facilities or for any other reason^ it could fairly safely be assumed that the sultan, would come, or could be brought in on our side. They were not disposed, in these circumstances, to take the difficulties now under consideration too seriously, 6, UP ., d'-TCI^-TT expressed the opinion that in point of fact no difficulty need ever arise provided that His Majesty’s Government could give a legal cover to their proceedings by persuading or compelling the Sultan to come in ee a belligerent on their side. There was nothing in the declaration of 1862 which prevented the sultan from going to war against anyone he chose, and his motives for doing so would be no legal concern of the French Government. The Question resolved itself into one of diplomatic tactics. It was difficult to conceive any circumstances in which His Majesty’s Government would find it vital to' use Muscat territory in time of issr without at the same time being prepared to ensure that the Sultan was a belligerent on their side, it might be that at a given moment they would find it. better policy to avoid out agonising any neutrals there might be in the war in question by refraining from infringing the neutrality of Muscat or making Muscat their ally, but there was little doubt that if they felt strong enough to do so they would have no hesitation in making Muscat a belligerent. If they did so, they would, as he had indicated, have a legal cover for their proceedings, T h€ 3 0,0* ?he pool t ton could be eunrsed up in tbu formula ‘Tiuooab an ally pluo Khor ^usmi or lino cut a uwitral onfl no Khor OTOai 5 '. QiMVlWB* BI0X3OH aleo thought that the queeti on xrotild be entirely oao of erpo&amp;iexxoy,* itii. ogt^od but m'ide the reservation that, \ihllfi, ©e stated abovo, the intUa Of^ioo did not feel any eerious doubt that if It ^&gt;0 important to Bcoure the activo 00 - operation of the sultan of irusoat in the event of a rrar this oouia be achieved, they naturally oould not {:ive :?n entirely firm sruarantoc on a point euoh aa this.

(see conclusion 8). 7 , minor yoini oonueoted with the depot, that of boundary woll^f wae then 6iocussed* CC^SUAIDE i HCKSON and ViH. $iAL stated that they had not yet investigated these questions, but that they considered that for jrarreoen of defence, it would be preferable to consider Khor ^u ni (or to the igland of Qhonaa) as a j ©ingiq unit* ’h: n e 1: abroad that whatever confidential plans the Admiralty might decide to mease for oertain posolbI&lt; eventualities, it- would be undesirable to asfc for the whole of i&amp;aS to be placed at the disposal of Hie I ^y f s covernrnc nt • This would sound far more c &gt; 1123 the c oi m important naval station andiSN^^^' the occupation of ifusoot territory then the mere use yA pU. {vU v/hioh to build store* houses. The ielacid /ae a desert in any case and the naval • •««nothing o a a • noral authorities would in practice be able to do what they lihed with the part outside their own area* 8* In roply to enquiries by the Admiralty representatives, m. LAI?H r JAITB admitted that there were certain rather trotiblesome tribes in the neighbourhood of the rusandim peninsula but thou^it it most unlikely that they would attack a depdt which was known to be used by the British naval forces in the Gulf and which was constantly visited by His Majesty’s ships, it was also suggested that if an attack did take place it would be ecpiivalent to an insurrection against the authority of the sultan and that it would be possible for punitive action to be taken against them on this ground. There seemed to be no objection to some rifles and even a machine-gun being kept on shore for the protection of the store-keeper and the coolies, provided the fact were not unduly advertisedi* 9. The next question for consideration was whether it was necessary to make any communication to the prench Government on the subject of the new depdt, MR, RENDEL admitted that, although he had suggested leaving this point to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris, sir G* Clerk would probably be in little better a position than the Foreign office to Judge the probable reactions of the : 'French. He himself had now rather come round to the view that no communication need be made. After some discussion it was agreed that th&lt;; balance of advantage lay in sayingnQthis^. it uas fairly clear that, subject to the precautions uhioh hid* been enjoined in the India office menavnndtin, the eotablichinsnt of a depot in irluaoat territory uoulti not infringe in any nay the terms of the declaration or c*ysa th° interpretation placed upon it by $o Utary In 1899« in. BWKKS9 pointed out that an explanation o to be offered in advance, the French Oov( rnnr ut might suopset that something nuch more important than t?u 3 really intended was in the air and regard explanation \b in iteolf evidence that His majesty’s Government nere uncertain of the legality of their notion. It seemed better on the whole therefore to let the rronoh Government find out about the new depot for thCTnselvee (ns they were bound to do) and to let the*.: complain f tin folt so disposed, in that case Hio uojf ^ty's ooverniiien: co ;ld explain that what they were doing was perfectly in keeping with the letter and spirit of ^ ola- v ie . a :ii vher point was, however, raised as io a-. :-uovir *. .• ..?/ e. if tiie French Government were to admit that the new clepGt was unobjeotienable in peace- tina ’: to as?, for a statomsnt of the intentions of .His Kaje^ty^ gov? rnraen t ar to its use in war tin©. it was agreed that -he av c Ud have to be to the effect that His Kajestyi© COv;.rn-cnt had no Intention of doing anything that rras oontrsi'p to the rules of neutrality (the point being of course ihV; ref'^ed to in paragraj is 5 and 6 above, i.e., that i it ^ro vital that Muscat should remain •• •.roTBain neutral, it v/ould be equally vital not to uge ichor Quwai, while if it were vital to use Khor Quwai, Muscat woLild have to become a belligerent), (see Conclusion &amp;)• 10* in. SEAL as Iced whether it would be legally possible for His Majesty*s Government to denounce the 1862 declaration unilaterally. After some discussion as to the distinction between the international instruments which were V ' denunciable (notwithstanding the absence of a denunciation clause ) and those which were not, it was agreed that the declaration was probably not denunciable, and that in any case, having regard to its nature, it would be neither practicable nor expedient for His Majesty’s Government to attempt to denounce it. XI. Ml. LAITHV/AIIE pointed out on behal ’ of the India Office that no steps could be taken to proceed with the preparation of Khor Quwai until the consent of the sultan of Muscat had been obtained. The time and manner in which this was to be done should be left to the discretion of the political Resident. Ah important subsidiary .point which would probably arise was the question of the payment of rent for the new dep6t. It was more than likely that the Sultan would look for some compensation, and the jnclia Office felt that for various reasons it would be desirable ! w'oCl , that in that event he should have it, it might be well | that if any payment at .all was necessary, a very small sum such as £100 or £200 a year, would suffice, ye had held the coal depot for many years without any payment of rent, though in the early stages of our occupation of it, a small rent had been charged. HI. rolilDEL pointed out that it might be desirable to disguise o a c odisguise the payment in some for instance under the form of an incre ised general or 7 ir subsidy* if, however, the payment v : re lin'iea ■■ith the ocoupr.tion of the depdt it would probably bel best t %au it should .ypsar as a simple payment for the occupation] of land. in any case, the word 'lease” must be avoided and the terms of the communication to the Sultan would require careful consideration, as the oomnranication might eventually become known to the prenoh and must not be inconsistent with our policy of usinr: the new depdt on precisely the s^aine basis as the existing coel depdt. All His iTa^esty’s Government could ask fpr was the use of a certain amount of land ”on sufferance' but it was not desirable actually to use this term. It was suggested and agree! that the best line would probably be to ask for permission to use| ^ certain area 'on the? same terms as had been granted for the use of the coal dep6t in Huso at harbour'. It was agreed that the Political resident should, if possible, obtain the sultan’s permission without any rent being offered or promised, and shoal in any event minimise the importance of the scheme as much as possible, both in his mannor of approach to the sultan and the terras of hio communication. 12, ? ith regard to the actual time-table of the proposed move, in. 3KAI&gt; stated that the Admiralty would probably wish to delay the start of actual work at Khor o r uwai until the new senioij Naval officer had reached tho 'Julf, (he thought in April) as it | would be inconvenient that the present ioniir Naval Officer shou^ begin the work anr- another man should have to go on with it. A general decision with regard to the move, and minor decisions on points of detail cun Id no doubt be taken before then, but even fc| that ..»4V that the Admiralty wo ill 5 probably wish to await the visit oi the new Commander-in-Chief, East Judies to the Gulf in janua^j nest a Il. ; ?o thought that there was danger in any delay even until January, as our position at Ken;]am was becoming increasingly precarious (witness the I’eccnt Persian demand that British naval stores should pay Per sian customs duty), and we might find ourselves evicted at any momenta He therefore urged very strongly that the Admiralty should obtain the opinion of the senior Naval Officer on the nuostions of detail to which they have already alluded as soon as possible. The Admiralty representatives pointed out that a certain delay was inevitable, if only for technical financial 'reasons, but agreed that they would do what they could (see conclusion 4)« IS. The meeting ended with some discussion as to the moment at which it would be desirable to communicate to the Persian government the fact that lien jam was being evacuated. TO. PPNBEIi thought that, so long as the Persians themselves did not raiso the general question of Hen jam, it would be as well to delay any formal communication to them as long as possible, it was, however* very desirable th ;.t the wor&amp; at Bahrain and Khor Quwai should be put in hand immediately. If the Persians were to revive their notice to us to quit, (which they might do at any time }, it would clearly be to the advantage of His Majesty's Government to be abl to point to tiie fact that they had already decided of their own accord and for their own reasons to move the depdt elsewhere 0 liter native ly it might be possible for Mr. Hugessen to utilise th evacuation of Henjssn as a counter with a view to secure some concession in return. This point, however, was essentiullr ons on which the advice of His Majesty's Representative at Tehran should be taken when the time came. M \ 0 P.ITIf'iITE points a outi 43 Q) that, from the point of vien of British prestige on the Arabian coast, it '.Tas highly desirable that the development of fJxor Quwai and the move from Henjam should be made to appear to take place in our otoi time and of our ovm volition. The sooner, therefore, : work could bs begun at ;chor 'inwai the better. 14. The conclusions oi the ids eting wero as follows:* OOtiOiUSI OHS: (1) That, since the flog not; flown at Hen jam would be formally transferred to Bahrain (which would be the official alternative station) the fact th -t it would not be possible to fly a flag at vhor quwai need not (subject to the views of the local naval authorities, which would be obtained by the Admiralty in the near future), constitute any serious obstacle to its use as a naval depot. (8) (a) that any legal difficulty which might arise from the use of Muscat territory by British forces in ti:ne of war would disappear if HUB cat were to beoome a belligerent; (b) that it was difficult to imagine a war in which it would be essential for British forces to use imsoat territory (l.E. rhor towai), without its being equally essential, from the point of view of major British interests, that jjusoat should be induced to become a belligerent; (c) that so fer as could be judged, the participation of Muscat as a belligerent in such a war could easily be secured and would probably come about automatically in any oase; (d) that even in the improboble event of a war in which it was for oorae reason desirable that Muscat should remain neutral the position of British forces at Zhor ouwai would be no worse than it would have been at Henjam;now •••» (e ) that any difficulties connected with the use of £hor Quwal by British forces in peace time, arising out of the Anglo ■french deolarration of 1862 and out of Lord Salisbury's statements of 1899, could be avoided if Xhor ouoai were only used on the same conditions as the existing ccaL depdt at Muscat and generally in the manner suggested in the papers before the meeting referred to in paragraph 1 of the record above: (f ) that in these circumstances the possibility of such difficulties need be no obstacle to the establishment of the proposed naval depdt at xhor Quwai. (3) that it would be preferable not to ta&amp;e any initiative in offering any explanations to the ?renoh Government, since to do so might only suggest that His Majesty*s Government were uncertain as to their legal position, but that if the French Government were to take up the question of the establishment of the depdt it would be possible to show that its use in the conditions indicated in conclusion ( 2 ) (e) was in no way •incompatible with the Anglo-French declaration of 1862; while if the French Government were to enquire as to the intentions of His Majesty*s Government in regard to the use of the depOt in time of war, they should be informed that His Majesty*s Government had no intention of doing anything contrary to the rules of neutrality (see paragraph 8 above). His Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris should, however, be kept fully informed as to what was intended and of ell developments. (4) that the Admiralty should as soon as possible consult the local naval authorities regarding the details of the area, accommodation, etc., required by them at FJhor Quwai. (5) thet the India Office should as soon as possible inform the Government of India a id the Political Resident of the proposalnow under .consideration and consult them regarding the time and manner in which the permisoion of the sultan of Muscat should be obtained. Terrdssion could not be actually sought until the requirements of the Admiralty arc re known; on the other hand no work should be undertaken and no communication made to third parties until permission had been obtained. Any communication to the sultan should make it clear that the use of Khor Quwai was being sought on precisely the same terms of tenure as in the case of the coal depdt at Muscat. (6) that the Admiralty and India Office should consult together regarding certain financial and other questions relating to the maintenance of the proposed depdt end its administration by the royal Indian navy, the provisions of lights and buoys, etc. (7) that the question of the exact moment at which the Persian Government should be informed of the intention of His Majesty's Government to evacuate Hen jam would have to be decided upon later, in -the light of various political factors and of the views of His Majesty's Minister at Tehran*comuTTi 7 ^ cr a. df?ekoi^ ST AIDING OFFICIAL SUB-COIO.'II?

I am sending copies of this letter to Colonel Fowle Yours sincerely, Muscat.'J Tv H [j j.1 i-i 1. • A?65Sti&gt;/ J-i w 3^ G omma nd e r -in-Ciii 91 , i''M jT ADMIRALTY, 14 tb. 1) ec emb e r, 1934. Copy to*.- lenior Naval Oiiicer, Persian a-ulf. Tati'; reference to year suomiseion Mo.770/£&gt;.I.3273i dated 19th October 1934 on the subject of bases in the Persian (iulf, I am to acquaint you that a decision in principle has now been token that fienjaa and Basidu shall be evacuated, provided that alternative accommodation in the Persian Gulf suitable for Admiralty requirements can be made availaole. For the time oeing, it is, of course, important that this decision should be kept secret. 2. Their 3 orb ships understand frcm your report under reference thu t, as or edging' at narrein is out of tne question, you are of the opinion that requirements could be met if Bahrein is supplemented by an advanced base near the moutn of tne aulf , and that for this purpose Kiior nuwai is the most suitable site. 3. In order to draw up the detailed scheme which is necessary before it can finally be stated that suitable alternative accommodation can be made ready, it is first necessary to decide how the facilities now available at Hen jam should be divided between Hhor Kuwai and Bahrein. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, envisages transferring as much as possible of these facilities to KLor Kuwai, including the storehouses, although in para.7 of ycui despatch under reference it is pointed out that if the Khor Kaliya at Bahrein is to be used (the necessity for which is accepted by Their Lordships) there are arguments in favour of placing the storehouses at Bahrein, at which place Gulf shipping normally calls, 4. Their Lordships are of opinion that if it is required to heap valuable property at Khor Kuwai it will be necessary to establish a permanent station there, comprising at least the present n•1•n. personnel at Henjam. ^s it would be uneconomical to maintain a permansne staff for the storehouses at Bahrein in addition, tne choice lies between a concentration of all /faciliti eo2 . facilities at Bahrein, Khor Kuv/ai being 1 useo merely for the landing of picnic parties with, possibly a simple hat xor this purpose, or a Station at KLor haaai as envisagec by che senior Naval Officer with the main recreational ease at Banrein consisting of a canteen and Officers' Club, playing grounds, and possibly a garden and swimming pool. Under the latter arrangement the staff at Bahrein could presumably be limited to a caretaker and assistant, 5. Their Lordships are advised that from an operational point of view it would be a great convenience, and that in addition some saving of fuel would oe realised, if a base were available at Kb or Kuwai containing a small permanent canteen and fuelling facilities, so that frequent visits to Bahrein would be unnecessary. This consideration points strongly to the desirability of a scheme on the lines suggested by the Senior Naval Officer, .Persian Oulf, although it must be borne in mind that it is not a small undertaking to create a permanent establishment upon a desolate and uninhabited island which contains no supply of fresh water. 6. Provided, therefore, you are satisfied that the difficulties in connection with this undertaking can be satisfactorily overcome, Their Lordships are disposed to aporove arrangements in which the storehouses, fuel barges, a clerk in charge and his staff, together with a small canteen and such rudimentary recreational facilities as can readily be constructed are established at Bior Zuwai, the purpose of Bahrein being that of a recreational base. A further consideration which loads to i.he same conclusion is the advantage of having a base in being where it will be required in war. 7. On the assumption that this provisional conclusion will be confirmed rheir Lordships have caused a memorandum to be prepared dealing in detail with the facilities required under each a scheme at Khor Kuwai and Bahrein, a copy of which is appended to this letter. I air to request that the Senior Naval /Officer * • c . . • C3. Officer, Persian Sail, may be instructed to etasider in detail the questions raised in this memorandum, and to furnish reports on the questions raised therein. Arrangements should be made locally to secure the assistance either of the 3.— officer attached to Air Headquarters, Iraq, or the engineer maintained in the Persian Half by the J?.S.0. Government of India, as most convenient. 8. With, regard to tho use of the Kiior hairy a , Their Lordships realise that the necessary steps, snort of dredging, to make the entrance navigable by sloops must be taken. ILey have therefore caused a detailed scheme for marking the entrance to the Eli or Ealiya to be prepared in the admiralty, in the liguc of the survey recently carried out by H.ik.n,0rua0nl)i!i. n copy of this scheme is appended to the enclosed memorandum. They are of the opinion that this scheme of marking would make it safe for sloops to use the entrance under normal conditions. 9. L s regards finance, it will be seen from a perusal of the enclosed memorandum that certain items such as generating plant, the large beacon and tide gauge at Khor Kaliya, etc. will require to be purchased in Great Britain and shipped out to the Gulf. Fayment for these items will, of course, be arranged by the Admiralty. On the other hand, the buildings and other works will be carried out by local contract, and Their Lordships have it under consideration to allow the Senior Laval Officer a lump sum, say of £10,000, for these purposes, to be expended by him at his discretion, subject to the broad outline of the approved scheme which will be drawn up on the basis of the enclosed memorandum. I am to request that you will report whether an arrangement on these lines would in your view be satisfactory, and if so, whether the sum proposed would be adequate. It would of course, be the responsibility of the Senior Laval Officer not only to account for the expenditure of the money , but to ensure, with such expert assistance as is available, that it was expended in the most economical manner possible.4 , r 10. iiB regards secrecv, it ’Kill probably be desirable to inake no oientioii to 11 e Persian G-over£inient of our intention to evacuate denjsin until Vv6 are ready Do loave, ii tneii• ane it will be necessary to nsep the proposal as secret as possible until the worn actually starts, and to carry out the work as rapidly as possible. It should bo borne in mind that the Persian Government may regard tne creation of new Haval stations in the Persian Gulf with suspicion, and may attempt to deoar us from using Hen jam when they hear of our intentions^ It is, in any case, desirable that no open steps should be taken until Their Lordships are in a position to give a final decision, after considering your reply to this letter. 11. The request to the Sultan of Muscat for permission to use the island will bo made by the Political huthorities in the Gulf, and the possibility that negotiations may take some appreciable time, makes it desirable for a final decision to be taken as scon as possible, I am, therefore, to request that a full report on all the questions raised in this letter may be prepared at an early date, and forwarded to the admiralty by Sir Mail.

Clearly a canteen and an officers* club, at least equivalent 'to those at hen jam, ^ a re necessary, together with plaving fields, etc. h swimming pool (mentioned by Senior Sav’d Officer, Persian Gull, as a possibility) would oe a great asset. No doubt much of the development would be undertaken by tli e sh i p s' c omp ani e o. It is suggested that.the nucleus of the recreational facilities including all items strictly necessary, should be provided at admiralty enoense, and that later development should be left to the ships themselves. A report is required from Senior Naval Qnicer, Persian Gulf, as to’what he considers would be a fair nucleus to commence with, and giving full details of the work he suggests should beg under taken at Admiralty expense, with sketch plans of the buildings projected. The swimming pool in particuiur‘would prconbiy fall''uiider this head, and if this is the case full particulars of his proposals for the construction and for the water supply should be furnished , to enable the question of providihg it frcm Navy Totes to be considered. 2.

If the coolies were not allowed to live on the island, as suggested in report dated N ovemoer, wnere would they be accommodated, and what jport arrangements are contemplated? 3 f i-iNh. An India Office Memorandum summarising the history of the Anglo-Krench declaration of 1862 is attached (Appendix No.2) The Bund a r G-iseeh incident (op.7 et seqj makes it desirable that our title at Khor guwai shoiildf be the same as that on which we neld the coal depot at xviuacat, as these were the terms on which in 1900 we'allowed the i?ranch to acquire a similar depot. The conditions were at thac cime staced to oe that 1 hio political or territorial rights of any Kind should be involved, and no rirht given to fly the national flag or to erect f ortiiiC'btions‘ r . (nee para. 3b, India Office Memorandum). These restrictions are to be observed in peace. In war, the matter will require special consideration, having regard in particular to the attitude of prance. In order to avoid if possible any dispute with Prance dia Oft ice and Poreign Office think that no flag at all ,j en the white ensign, should be flown at Khor Kuwai. The flag from Hen jam would, therefore, be fprmally removed to Bahrein. i report as to the acceotability of this the India not eve restriction should ue made. presumably a flagstaff for signalling purposes would be required in any case.

It is understood that the danger of interference by Arabs in the neighbourhood of Khor Kuwai is small. It should oe confirmed that no protection such ?s a wall is necessary. It should also be stated whether it is recommended that the R.I.N. ratings should be armed, observing that in the absence of a sloop there will be no responsible officer present to take charge. 5.

L TO, FOB ST QRlo. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, proposes to bring these from Henjam (paragraph 13, submission of IPth September). This will reouire the formal sanction of the Government of India, which wiil be obtained by the Admiralty when the scheme has been f ins 1 ly sa nc t i on ed o The rails are not considered essential, and it should oe stated what expense if any would be involved in moving them. 7. BQ/jTS, LIjhiT hhS. .-TO* , Senior haval Officer, Persian Gulf, reports (oaragraon lb, suomission of lith oeptember) that the old steam boat at heniam is practically done for, ond that the other boats cannot last much longer. He suggests a couple of locally built flat bottomed lighters, each carrving as much as a service launch and propelled by outboard motors! He estimates the cost of the lighters at under £100 each. The Admiralty opinion is that outboard motors would be unsatisfactory, and that engines of a type similar to those fitted in a Service launch (petrol driven) would be preferable. It is realised tnat these motors would be more Difficult to unship if overhaul at jomoay were necessary, but on the other hand ordinary running repairs would oe within the capacity of ships’ stiffs. A report is necessary giving full details of the type of craft envisaged and stating whether such motors could be satisfactorily fitted by native labour. 3. L IGHTS . The light at Hen jam will be.required there so long as the telegraph station remains and it is necessary for the mail steamer to call. If a light at Khor Kuwai is of substantial advantage to passing shipping, it might be justifiable that the expense should oe borne.by the dues collected at Basrah. It is in any case desirable to determine the degree of importance of a light from the Admiralty point of view. Perhaps a light buoy would suffice. A further report on these points ia necessary. 9* OIL 3ABGH3 A n!

On the other hand there is sufficient level ground for 'kicking about a football' and excellent bathing beaches which might be netted to keep out the sharks.

On the 13th instant I sought an interview with Mis 2 Highness and approached him on the lines indicated in your telegram T/21 of 8th instant. I explained to Mis Mighness our requirements i.e. the use of the whole Island for recreational purposes* a place fthere officers and men of His Majesty’s Mavy could come ashore for exercise* without let or hindrance* and where they could be free to enjoy themselves after the cramped quarters on board ship. 3. Per this purpose it was desired to erect a small building to serve as an Officers Club* withsmA other modest buildings accommodate a store keeper* steres with personnel to iook alter the same* and te previde a Canteen lor the men. it was also desired to have moerings for an oil barge. 4. i peinted out to Mis highness that at times it might prove necessary te maintain a sloop or sloops in &lt; uscat territorial waters for his assistance* as for example was the case at Qiasab and Sur in 1929 and 1932 respectively. In such eventuality it was impossible for long periods at a time for the personnel to get aiiy relaxation from their arduous duties, as no-Jk 2. placs existed eleee at hand where chips cempaniee ceuld come ashere unfettered by disciplinary restrictiens. 5 , His Highness*s attitude was at first pensive and silent se, te re-assure him* i judged it eppertune t» say that i trusted he «euld net think that the prepesal invelved any attempt te acquire territery and, that as at ifekalla Ceal Depet, ne flag 7 * weuid be fve^n» 6 # His Highness immediately brightened up and said that ne such idea had secured te him, but that he *as reflecting en what pretectien if any weuld be necessary. He said that he must see the island himself and enquire inte the lecal situatien generally befere giving any reply, v 7* Aveiding the term 'depeV* stressed the fact that if His Highness did grant the permissien seught, the little establishment weuld be en a very medest scale and might preve ef great value te him. 8. His Highness, whs new appeared te view the prepesal very foveurably, then asked if a eleep ceuld oenvey him at a later date frem Khaeah te Jazirat el Ghanam te view the island.

On the morning ef the 26th instant, shortly prior to our arrival in fuscat, Kis Highness informed me verbally that he had made up his mind and that he would gladly accord the permission sought, with certain minor provisos, n® promised to send me his written reply the same aiternoon. 13 # A somewhat rough^ passage had hewever upset His Highness and he ».as unfertunately indispssed for the rest of the 26th fcarch and most of the next day.

I believe Clauson discussed this matter with you over the telephone and said that, so tar as he coiud see, there was no objection to your proposals. I am now writing to confirm that we see no objection to the removal of the ban of secrecy which was clearly only intended to be temporary, and that we concur in 3 -our proposal that the Naval Authorities should new a ddress the Political Resident with a view to the Sultan of Muscat being approached.

My dear Claus on, A few months ago we asked the Commander-in-Chief East Indies to submit the detailed proposals for the small advanced base at T Dior Kuwai, and I enclose herewith a copy of his reply. You will note that he is anxious for an early decision as to the removal of the secrecy ban which was imposed last year during the difficult stages of the evacuation. Subject to your concurrence we now propose to inform the Commander-in-Chief that he may approach the Sultan of Muscat through the Political Resident and make the other preliminary enquiries as to labour and materials mentioned in paragraph 3 of Appendix T of the Senior Naval Officer's Report. /e should propose subsequently to examine the detailed proposals from a technical point of view before a final decision to proceed with this scheme is taken. The telegram mentioned in paragraph 2 of Appendix I was forwarded to Laithwaite with our printed letter I».0421/16/30 of the 28th March 1935. The Commander-in-Chief has since sent a telegram hastening the reply on this point and ve should therefore grateful if you would treat the matter as immediate.

With reference to paragraph 12 of Minute I, I concur in the desirability of a small causeway subject to the cost of exceeding the £75 mentioned. 5. ?/ith reference to paragraph 13 of Minute I, it is considered that a Type 52 W/T set v/ould be more suitable than a Type 53 v/T set, owing to the difficulties of maintaining end charging batteries in a hot climate. Provided suite generator is selected, which will operate the lights, fens and refrigerator, and provide a source of power for the Type 52 */'? set, the motor generator normally used with this set would not be/2 be required, and t hue communication '.'.'ith the outside world could be maintained in emergency at little, if any, increase in cost* Sd. 5.?. ^OSS.

Canteen with s eparate building with earth closets. Caretaker and Assistant's Quarters. Native latrine. Design and con 3 truction . Design on the lines stated in 43/SI. 32733. APP. II, para.24. Plans for these buildjpp have been pnpared by the Section Officer, R.A.F. Works anFeuildings, Basra, the same type of construction being used as at Bahrain. Come slight alterations to the original sketch plans have been made as the result of experience at Bahrain and these should tend to simplify construction. Citing . It is considered eesential that a careful final survey is carried out as recommended by the Section Officer Basian in App.II, para.57 of Reference (i) in which he states 'Very great care will have to be exercised in the final siting oi the buildings ion the Peninsula as the general structure is not entirely satisfactory’*. The present Section Officer -Ur.Cox, is prepared to make this final examination subject to t he approval of t he Chief Engineer, Air Hefidouart ers , Irs-Q.2. mrmML TITTING3 . ' It is considered waste of money putting up the se buildings at all unless they can be made reasonably comfortable and inviting. In the original scheme, no provision was made for lights, fans or refrigerators and it is unlikely that much use would be made of Canteen and Officer's Club during the summer months, when base will be most[frequently used, unless these are installed} both officers and roitings are likely to prefer remaining on board where shade, light, forced ventilation and ice are available, whereas from the health point of view it is most desirable to encourage a change of scene ashore* I consider, therefore, that the supply of fans, lignt and refrigerators essential- Enquiries have been made and it would appear that a suitable installation would be a H kw. petrol driven Electric Light set such as produced by the G*3£#C., which could be installed comp with internal wiring for about £125. A small shed to house the engine would be required, also refr igerators and overhead An estimate based on Bahrain experience to covei a H items is £250. » •plIRNIT'TRTi! . In the original scheme no provision nppears lave been made for furnishing other than at the main a , iahrain. It is suggested that t he essential requirements )oth for officers' club and Canteen are light osier chairs, sables and a clock, all of which could probably best be obtained Bombay. 1 am unable at present to put forward an estimate •or the above, but would submit that they should be Admiralty lommltments and that I should be given discretionary powers to ise a sum up to, say, £100 to pruchase what is necessary, t. 2ATM. It is proposed to erect 3 in ITo.500 gallon galvanised .ron tanks similar to those provided at Bahrain. These to be ilaced on a small platform standing on a concrete base and would se made mosquito proof. Ko piping vould be used. Matting shelter so be built over them as protection from sun. Water would be au Pplied/h! - 3 - supplied from time to time by sloops and in addtici\ a contract would be made for a monthly supply of water by water dhow from Khas sab. A water dhow is available at Khassab ani supplies Quoins Li^ht House periodically. Dhow has a 400 gallon wood tank and price is about 30/- a load. This water however cannot be relied on to remain sweet longer than one month. Estimated consumption of local staff is 15 gallons a day. Sloops would normally land their own drinking water when present. A semi rotary pump would be provided for pumping water from dhow to tanks. 5. RSCRSATIOS-L FACILITIES , (a) Bathijjg.. It was origmnally intended that Ghubna Karbari Bay should be used as a bathing beach for ships* companies. Sharks having several times been observed in this bay, it is not now considered suitable. Owing to its *idth, depth of water, irregular bottom and the fact that it is exposed to the prevailing S. V wind, it is not considered that it could be satisfactorily netted against sharks, without undue expense. Bathing will probably have to be confine, to the tays Notth and South sides of Salib Peninsula which appear to be shark free, and which can be cleared of coral. (b) Xick-about Ground. The only practical position for this is close to Ghubna Karban beach.. As this latter has been abandoned i i &lt;-» q i nnr? wav from the Canteen* it i° for bathing purposes and is a long way -ij v-, in ^u^imer and se 1 dom in winder, improbable that it would be used in su.imer arm v*c.t nrovis i on of this should be It is not, therefore, proposed that provision . . • -i . —4. vapY* experience oi re quit cm en - s proceeded with, anyway until f has been gained. (c) Tannis Court . The only possible position for a court is that shown on the original site plan on Salib Peninsula. Section officer's report in App.H, Para.20 of Reference U! ^ ^ oted here for convenience. 'This is the only area that could be adapted for this propose, and even here the ground level renders the/ the cos onr tract i or Int i v eljJ - 4 - the cost of construction relatively heavy. as this ground is a natural sufface drainage area, the court would have to be protected by channels dug round its edges. The construction v,ould be muttee. It is feared that the mud for this would have to be imported as nothing of this nature was seen on the island'. This muttee mud would have to cone from 'Basrah of Bahrain. It is considered, therefore, that the question of Construct ion of this court should be deferred until further experience of requirements and possibilities has been obtained. Games are not normally played between 15 th July and 3Cth October* 6. FLAGSTAFF . As no flag is to be flown, no necessity for tms arises, since type 53 W/T set has its own aerial and posts. 7. EU3L. It is proposed that one oil fuel barge shoulu maintained at Khor Kuwai, moorings would be laid by a slpop. Barge to contain fuel oil, bagged coal for use of sloops, d.esel oil and a small supply of petrol for use of sloops and elect-ic light plant. Asmall enclosed lock-up st re to be ii,.ed latter on the upper deck at the after end of tne oil barge simple undertaking. Capacity - 100 in No.4 gallon tms. All the above fuel could be replensihed from time to time by ’’KHUZISTAII'* without the necessity of a a-.-P Bahrain. It is proposed that suitable locks should be fitted to the pump house and fore and after compartments in oil targe.^ U m i •.1/4 ho 'nints.incd. aboard Ans 01 1. also proposed that no c e# shoe d. i ion the upper deck and th.e barge, as there is nothing to p -Kip r^-retaker s.nd assistants barge would be in the full view from their quarters. f be moved to Khor Kuwai until the caretak Oil barge not to be mo and assistants have been installed. _. , that there should be 8. CARET &amp; ASSISTANTS . - p • and f hat these should be Arab caretaker and four assistants an r ot * suitable men being obtained subjects of ihe Sultan oi i-ius-^at, through the Political Agent, Muscat. Their/5 Their duties would be the care, maintenance and improve ments of base as directed, meeting mail steamers and transporting stores from them, maintenance and attendance at oil barge as v requisite. They will require a boat, and as tidal stream sets strongly through the Khor it is not considered that less than four men could be employed to manage the boat and do the work required. rn accordance with H.H. the Sultan's wishes they would be armed with rifles, probably purchased locally and a small stock of ammunition, which would be mustered periodically be sloops and an explanation required of any rounds used. The caretaker would be held responsible for the safety of the goats on the island in accordance with the wishes expressed in the Sultan's letter. It is hoped to obtain a caretaker for Hupees two per diem and the assistants for Rupee one per diem, but this may have to be exceeded. STOKES . Under peace cons it ions it is proposed that an arrange ment to be made with the representative of the B.I.3.N. Co. •Bombay for 'Up slow' mails to call at Khor Kuwai as and when required as an additional periodic call port on their present itinerary, and that mails, fruit and potatoes snould be delivered there for sloops present or working in the souther section. Reference (i) para. 34. In the absence of sloop ^concerned these would be collected by the caretaker and his assistants ana stowed temporarily in tne canteen. Quarterly stores, victualling sna canteen stores siiould be sent to Bahrain. 10. BOA^. It is considered that a small native craft would be more suitable than a service boat, since Arabs will be at ho e in it and not go mapy men would be required to handle i ^ • in r. . men would be required to handle a service skiff in tne tleeway and would hold at the best half a tone of stores, whereas a small native craft worked by three men would be capable of dealing with3£ tons of stores, The price second hand would be about Z2Q. This latter craft is proposed. 'll* NAVIGATIONAL AID . It is proposed that a small stone cairn shodd be erected on the end of Ras Salib; cairn having a short pole in centre wired and fitted with a red electric light bulb capable of being writched on and off as required. This would be a heJp to sloops entering at night and is thought would be sufficient for '’KHTJZI3TAN*; but it is not anticipated that 3.1. Stamers would enter at night under any circumstances. Reference (i), para.35. 12. CAU57TVAY . At ^resent from one hour either side of L. *7. springs nothing larger than a skiff can scrape across the reef which prevents access to the landing beach. C'.'ral will have to be cleared from this reef to make a wide deep water channel. Pulling boats will then be able to land on the beach at all states of the tide ; but power boats never. After experience at Bahrain it is estimated that a shor^ 50 feet cuaseway can be constructed with coolie labour 1 rom stone available on Salib Peninsula and from cleared coral. ^bis would cost approximately £?5 and n °t S175 as previously stated. It is considered that this causeway is most desirable; it will facilitate landing of building stores, thus saving time and money, will facilitate landing of weekly stores, will enable £&gt;ower boats to have access to shore for three hours either --^de of high water, will facilitate landing of personnel and in the event of base being put on a war footing will efaabie war stores etc. to be landed until a more ambitious causeway can be built. I would propose that this short causeway built , as v^eing well wotth theeponey. 13. COWJNICATIONS . Asimple system of single flag hoists ^0 — —— ■ — » communicate requirements of sloops t o the caretaker io proposed. A Type 53 7/T set has been received in dhoreham and will be available to be landed at the base if and when required. It woul be stowed when not in use in one of the buildings and arrangements7 - could be made to accommodate crew in Canteen should they have to be left ashore in the absence of a sloop. This is rather more a matter for future consideration. A W/T hut should not be required. 14. ESTIMATES . An amended estimate is enclosed - Appendix II- embodying all the proposals put forward in this letter. It is preferred not to attempt to amend the estimates for buildings put forward previously by the Section Oificer, y/orks and Buildings, Iraq. There are at present so many unknown factor^s such as the cost of obtaining suitable labour hire of dhow transport for them , maintaining them on the island with food and water, the cost and method of transporting materials from various places to the island, and the time factor, none of which can be ascertained until preliminary enquiries can be made, In this connection I would refer to Appendix II, paragraphs 32 and 33 of Reference (i).

Tentative arrangements have already been made with the Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters, Iraq for a reliable Indian supervisor to carry out the work when required. The man earmarked his considerable experience in working on his own with direct labour, and in this case he will be working to detailed plans prepared by .Varies and Buildings, R.A.E., Baoran. Monthly visits of a British supervisor should not he necessary. A sloop would attend at Know Kuwai as much as possible in a similar manner to that carried out at ^ahrain. It will be necessary to give the Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters as long notice as possible of approximate date supervisor will be required. 2. Secrecy . Instructions contained in the last sentence of Admiralty message to C.in.C.,E.I, (340) timed 1725/27th March 1935, state that 'Khor Kuwai should not repetition not be publicly mentioned at this atage’*. as far as I am aware this ban has not been lifted. Request I may be informed by signal when secrecy is no longer necessary in order that preliminary investigations as to supply of labour and materials can be made. 3. Labour . It is proposed to obtain some of the masons and craftsmen and all the coolies from Muscat territory. A certain number of coolies are available at Khassab, which is only 12 miles distant . The Naval Contractor at Muscat has been sounded and he appears to be ready to supply, transport and maintain coolies to any part of the ffulf required • Cost could not be ascertained owing to secrecy ban on place involved. Reference has been made frequently in the past to the few skilled craftsmen available at Bahrain and it is pr pbable/bable that the extra men needed will have to te obtained pro from Iraq. -v Jt is proposed that the whole question of labour should b investigated by the Section Officer,;'. Tories and Buildings, or the supervisor, some weeks before work is due to co 'linenee and detailed arrangements for his requirements made then with the Naval Contractor * at Muscat* 4. Haterials &gt; As everything used in the construction will have to be imported, it is proposed to accumulate e supply of stone and other necessary materials be! ore the main tody of workmen are sebt to the island. Stone on Ghanam Island is unsuitable for buildings. Samples of other stone from various adjacent localities have been collected and shown to Section Officer, Basrah, and it is expected that a suitable type can be obtained from a bay near Khassab and under the jurisdiction of the V/ali, with whom we-- are on good terms. It is proposed that this should confirmed by the Section Officer at the same time as he makes his survey to determine the sites of the buildings (see para.l in Siting). As the neighbourhood is entirely devoid of firewood, the juss (local mortar) would need to be b*u&lt;ned before transport to the island; the price per bag might tnen well P rove n “ expensive as a corresponding amount of Portland cement obtained through Chief Engineer, A.H.Q., Iraq, vhicn i- far preferable. This point cannot be determined accurately until juss contractor can be given the destination of the consignments. An estimate of the quantities of building materials required has already been prepared by the Section Officer, Easrah, so that by ordering well in advance, the delays due to the non-arrival of materials from England such ns have been experienced at Bahrain, may be avoided. 4 -^-r. \u in v-p Y ’#?nuired for the building 5. ^ater . Fresh water will ce -equi.eu w ork.3 (jfe) work. For this, it is proposed to obtain some Arab tan^cs for storage temporarily, supply of water being made from a sloop or by contract from Khassab. 6. Time Table, (a) It is proposed that the preliminary inspection of building sttes, stone to be used ano arrangements for labour referred to above should be made as soon as practicable after Shoreham’s return to the Gulf and in conjunction ./ 1 1h a time suitable to Chief Engineer, A.H.Q,., Iraq. It is anticipated that this could be carried out early in April. (b) That materials should belanded at Khor Kuwai about end of April, by which time weather should be suitable. (c) That building work should commence in May as soon as practicable.KHOR KIP'/A I APPENDIX II to Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf's No. 12/423 of 11th January 1936. AMENDS!) ESTIMATE.
