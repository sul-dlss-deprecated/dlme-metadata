Not ification. r With reference to Notification No.1502.G. dated the 2nd September 1915, the following notice under the hand of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, dated the 17th January 1916, is published for general information. Whereas by Article 79 (l) of f, The Bahrain Order in Council 1913 ft provision was made that the said Order should come into force on such day within six months of its publication in the Gazette of India' as the Governor General of India in Council might, by notification in the said 'Gazette', appoint on that behalf. And whereas the said order was published in the 'Gazette of India' on the 3rd February 1915. And whereas by Article 2 of'The Bahrain (Amendment) Order in Council 1915' the words 'One year' were substituted for the words 'six months' in Article 79 (l) of the Principal Orders and it was also provided that it should be lawful for the Sec retary of State, by notice given under his hand, to extend the said period of one year for such period, not exceeding twelve months, as may be prescribed in the said notice. Now I, the Right Honourable Austen Chamberlain, one of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do hereby give notice under my hand that the said period ofl one year heretofore mentior -ed shall be extended for a further period of six months. ~^f 1 17th January 1936. Sd/ Austen Chamberlain. Sd/ A.H.G rant, Secretary to the Government of India. t.D.S. (p.r, . Tlio Ba) rain Order-in-Gounyil coraee into force on 2nd August unless again postponed. Meanwhile the 'khiairia' question has to be settled. In ray letter ifo.2120 datod 1st Uovenber 1915 to Govern ment (extract attached) I said you would address Government on this subject in due course. I attach a copy of Major Keyes letter of 28th Vay 1915 which gives his views on the matter. I ti.gree /ith Major Keyes that it is .dvisable that in oases where a Bahrain subject is involved 'Khidma 1 should be levie l at the rc.te of 10)2 as formerly. * I was under the impre sion that the niestion of •khidna’ had been thrashed out some years ago but I cannot ind any record that it was. Nor does there appear to be any record as to how the Agency Court started -paying 1 khidma 1 to t) o Shaikh at such a high r;.te. I imagine, however, that the practice tlvvly grew uo as in the local Courts the Shaikh was in the habit of collecting lo)2 1 khidraa* from any sums realised and that it was thought (and rightly no doubt' that the Shaikh would demur less to the*transfer of a large proportion of he judicial rights to he Agency Court, if he received his usual fees. hajor Keyes estimates the annual receipts from ’khidma* lees that on cases*in w v ieh Bahrain subjects are involved, at bout Rs.3,600/- per annum and suggests that we should offer the Sheikh he.300/- per mensem as corponsation for the loss vhich will be incurred by him on the introduction of the new system. 1 think this proposal is a good one •hhidna* h .^ing been recovered arti paid to the Shaikh for years we cannot ignore his claim to compensation. Besides this as ajor Keyes ✓ points out the process serving a d other servicer for the Agency Court have been clone by the Shaikh*a officials. Very badly it is true until the retirement of the old w Amir of Manama' - while he was there. Political Agents anxiously awaitedawaited the time when the Court could have its own offi cers - but natters are better now. In any case all pro cesses to bo served outside the actual town of Manama would have to bo dealt with by the Shaikh's offioers. If it is agreed that the best arrangement is to com pound with the Shaikh about the'khidma* it remains to be decided whether we should address Government at once making the JTiggeetion to offer the Shaikh 300/- p.m. in lieu of •khidma', or whether before doing so we should ask Major Stewart/ sound the Shaikh on the subject. Possibly the latter course would be best, as we should look rather foolish if the suggestion was Sanctioned and the Shaikh proved obstinate and declined to accept the arrange ment . We might of course if we adopted the other method tell the Shaikh that the time had arrived*for a regular Court and that in regular Court a fixed scale of fees were charged in all countries, thit when once we started regular fees it vould be impossible to levy 'khidma' in addition, but that a c ireful examination of the accounts showed that in years of much litigation •khidma' on suits in whioh Bahrain subjects were not involved average Rs.3,600/- per annum, and we had therefore decided to pay him this sum regularly at 300/- p.m. We might add that originally the practice of levying •khidma• which is opposed to the prac tice of British Courts grew up without the sanction of Governrnont, but Government did not wish him to be a loser by the introduction of some regular legal methods and so offered 300/- p.m. as compensation. H© could then take it or leave it.

With reference to the previous demi-official correspon dence regarding the postponement of the application to Bahrein of the order In Council, I suggest that the Order might come into force on the expiry of the last period of extension notified In Foreign and Political Department No- y tiflcation Ho. 232 0. of the 24th February 1916, namely on the 3rd August next. 2. Judging by some experience of the working of the al most Identical Order which has been In force,In Mascat since January, I should say that the Introduction of the Order here will not in actual practice make much differ- -ence In the former procedure for the settlement of cases. Parties to whom the Order applies can no doubt claim to have their cases tried out under British Indian Laws, but they showed no inclination to do so at Mascat. On the con- trary, I was several times informed by leading British Merchants at Mascat, that they greatly appreciated the celerity and simplicity of the existing system of legal procedure. Though I have no personal experience yet of the liti gation in Bahrein, there seems no obvious reason why the attitude here should prove to be different from that of Mascat. On the contrary, the literature on the subject shows that the people here are averse to innovations. For these reasons, I think it need not be anticipated that the gradual introduction of the Order during the War would produce any discontent. Always provided thatBS the two points which, in my opinion, are really somewhat thorny, namely, the introduction of Court fees and the qued^ tion of the Sheikh*s 'khidma', are left over till a more con venient 8eason 0 In order to leave these matters in abeyance for the present, all that would be necessary, I think,would be a demi-official assurance of the approval of the Resident 3. If Sir Percy Cox agrees that the Order might be intro* duced on the 3rd August next, the question as to the appoint ment of the Judicial Assistant might, I suggest, now be set** tied. The present situation is that Keyes was given authority to make a selection, but this has not yet been done. Naib Tahsildar Abdul Hamid of the N.W.F.P., whose name has been mentioned in this connection, is very well known to me. He had had very little judicial experience when, about m two years ago, I sewured him the appointment as Manager of a large Court of Wards Estate. He is not, in my opinion, quite what is required; and his ignorance of Arabic, would I think, greatly lessen his use fulness for a long time to come. Sayyid Sadik Hussan, formerly of Mascat, is not personal- -ly known to me - but from what I saw of his work on files I should say that he has sufficient judicial experience for the class of work likely to arise in Bahrein, and no doubt he will, with practice, improve and acquire a sufficient know ledge of regular procedure. His acquaintance with Arabic and English are strong points in his favour. He left Mascat in Bonn’s time, hoping to get an appoint*^ ment under the Foreign Department. In this he was disappoint ed. He wrote just before I left Mascat intimating that he was willing to rejoin there. I gave his letter to Ducat, who had I believe, some idea of getting him back in place of the pre sent inefficient holder of the post of interpreter there. I suggest that he might be given a trial here. He mightcome at once as Interpreter, and ne would prooaoiy ua wil ling to do so If he might he given to understand that, as soon as the order in Council came into force, he would he given a trial as Judicial Assistant on one years protetlon. If this suggestion is approved, I will write in the above sense to Sadlx Hassan. I nave not got his address, I should Da much obliged if you would kindly telegraph for it to Ducat, Mr, Fernandez at Basra alsoi thin* Knows it. He would, I expect, hesitate to come now on the pay of the Interpreter Bahrein, viz, Rs 100/- p.m., wnen he can get Rs, 150/- at wascat. But if the Order is to coae into force from 3rd August next, I expect I could arrange to let him have 150/- till then oy arrangement of the office allowance, I should oe extremely glad to get him as soon as possible as the Persian who is at present officiating here as Inter preter is far from efficient; and it would oe a good thing if the new Judicial Assistant had some Knowledge of local conditions oefore taxing over the duties oi this post.it'/ifc t 'yf J ©// i'h9 H9nii9ncy Bunhire, 10th April I arr- writln£ ar ad-irit^rlm reply to your )/o receiTel by 'Lawronce* about the Bahrein Order-in-Oouroil.

At present unless another Order in Council la Issued, the Bahrain Order-in-Council comes into force on the 2nd February 1917« The question la, are we going to allow it to come in or get it postponed again? If the former the question of '’Chid- mah' ought to be settled. As regards bringing the Order-in* llajcr Kayes of course was againat bting'ng it into force during the war, partlyV bacause his view was that if it was brought in the whole^it should be enforced, forthv/ith, and this would of course create difficulties. On the other hand Major Stewart thought the Order might be introduced at any time provided it was done gradually, and advocated bringing it in. He had of course less experience of Bahrain than Major Keyes. Now, however, the latest news ifi that he is not to come back to Bahrain (which seems a pity as he apparently wanted to do so), and that Colonel Ducat is to go'there. We do not know what the latter^ views oh the subject are. I am myself inclined to think that there would be no objection to Introducing the Order provided the Political Agent can do it little by little. If we wait till Colonel Ducats arrival to decide whether the order is to be introduced on 2nd February 1917 or not there will not be time to settle the ' Chidmah' question before that date. To wait for his views therefore would amount to deciding to postpone the introduction of the Order. ' -) D. P.

M.E.R. 16-5-17•British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushlre, May 1917« A copy of the undermentioned ondorsenont is forwarded to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for information, with reference to his telegram No 380 dated 9th May 1917* By order. Major, First Assistant Resident, From the First Assistant Resident, Bushlre, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, No. 851 dated 10th April 1916, with enclosures. l}i*TOin, Captain p.. political To, The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Pushire. Political Agency, i\lo.359 Bahrain, the 7th Pay l.;17. Sir, I have the honour to suggest that the introduction of the Bahrain order in Council might with advantage he carried out in the near future. The occupation of Baghdad,the trend of recent news from the Western Pront and the entry of the United States of America into the war indicate that the situation is # s unlikely again to become such as to disturb the communitie of the Persian Gulf,and it seems desirable to make the Order in Council an established fact while there are no subjects of the great Powers (except the ianerican missionaries) in Bahrain,and especially before the possi ble coming of Japanese traders. I venture ,however,to urge that the question of jurisdiction over the subjects of certain Arab Chiefs, with whom Shaikh ’Isa claims to have reciprocal agree ments in this regard,more particularly over Hasawis, should be settled at the same time, iis you are aware, Ohaikh ’Isa’s endeavours to deal with cases connected with iiasawis are a constant source of friction between him and the political Agent,and of late he has renewed his activities in this direction; a recent case,reported in my telegram i\o.lo-C of February 15th, 1917,was tided over by informing Shaikh ’isa that the Government of IndiaIndia were too busy with work connected with the war co deal with ouch a problem as a change of jurisdiction and that pending their decision he must not upset the exist ing order of things, but there is little doubt that he will bring this question up as soon as the introduction of the Order in Council is mooted. He contends (and from the Agency records it appears that he contended verbally both before and after writing his letter) that his letter of July 16th,1909,giving jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government,was not meant to include the sub jects of the Arab Chiefs with whom he had these agreements; also that now din da f ud is no longer a vassal of Turkey •*' and has asked him (dhaikh ^sa) to look after his subjects in Bahrain. He says that he gets requests from these • X* dee letter do.556 of September 9th, Chiefs to exercise his 1915,from the Political Agent, : Bahrain to the political Resident : good officer? and so in the Persian Gulf. : forth on behalf of their subjects,and,being legally unable to do so,feels the difficulty and indignity of his position very keenly. He has been informed that the whole question has &amp; See enclosure to letter . Bo.1684 of June end,1914, from the Offg.Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the foreign decretary to the Government of India. been submitted to the dovernment of India,and that,pending the receipt of their orders,such persons must continue under the jurisdiction of the Poli tical Agent. there seem to be two courses open to us:- Firstly . Definitely to inform dhaikh 'Isa once for all that no infringement of our jurisdiction over these classes A will be tolerated,and to uphold our decision. Secondly . To admit dhaikh 'Isa’s contention,reserving to ourselves the right to intervene in case of any serious miscarriage of justice. The latter course is strongly advocated,for,with the passing of Turkey and the entry of din Ga'ud and the dhaikh of Qatar into treaty relations with ourselves,the chief reason for retaining our jurisdiction in ^ahrainover the subjects of the Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf littoral loses its weight,and,provided that the several Chiefs concerned are content to allow Shaikh ’Isa to deal with their subjects,the change would offer the following advantages:- It would (l) remove a constant source of friction between Ghaikh ’Isa and the Political Agent, (g) be a powerful inducement to Shaikh ’Isa to accept the order in Council without trouble and afford proof both to him and to his subjects that the Order in Council is not intended to infringe on his authority, (G) make a graceful concession in recognition of his improved bearing towards reforms and of his attitude during the war,and ( 4 ) rid us of a considerable number of petty and vexatious cases in the Court. Further,should bin Sa’ud establish a port of his own,as is understood to be his intention,uahrain will cease to be of so great importance in the affairs of Najd and Hasa as it it today,and,if it is to be granted,the concession of Jurisdiction should be made while it yet has anhigh value t in the eyes of Ghaikh ’Isa. The following action is,therefore,suggested:- (l) Ghaikh ’Isa should be asked to produce his agreements,and copies ,compared and certified by him and the political Agent,should be obtained. (£) The Chiefs concerned should be asked if they are willing to abide by the agreements,subject to our intervention in case of any serious miscarriage of Justice. (3) Ghaikh ’Isa should be informed that the Govern ment of India have considered his request,and are prepared, subject to the reservation regarding intervention,to grant him jurisdiction over the subjects of the signatories to the agreements,and at the same time propose to put the Court in Bahrain on a regular footing. as regards the settlement of the ’hhidmah’ ( a fee of 10 1o10 jo now levied on all auma collected through the Gourt and paid to the Shaikh) question,! cannot improve on the See his letter Inio. of ^ay 28th, 1915, plan put forward to the Officer on Special Duty,Sushire: J . by iiajor Keyes, provided that Shaikh ^sa be clearly informed that the payment of the £.300/- per mensem is conditional on the political Agent receiving reasonably efficient service in connection with the Court from his (Shaikh Visa’s)officials otherwise there will be no incentive to the latter to assist in cases in which only British and/or Foreign sub jects are concerned,as there will be no ’khidmah depen dent on their efforts. 1 have the honour to be, four most obedient servant.No. //^T3 R osidenoy, -ff- Bushire, ^^Juno 1917. P.R. and C.P.O» Reference correspondence ending ^ith D.C.P.C^s telegram 5980 dated 13th Hay 1917 regarding Introduction of the Bahrain Order in Council. At present|the date fixed for its enforcement is 2nd August 1917, but the period may be extended up to 1919. I nov/ submit a copy of a letter No.359 dated 7th May 1917 (received ho^e 6th June 1917 owing to bad mail service) from the Political Agent, Bahrain, suggesting that the Order should be brought into force as soon as possible, i.e. from 2nd August 1917. Owing to the delay in receiving this letter the tine has been cut rather short and I am a little doubtful if we could make satisfactory arrangements for bringing it in so soon. This letter was sent in response to a request from me to make an official application if he desired to suggest (as he had done in a D/0) that the Orddr should be introduced at once. Captain Loch, however, proposes that the Order should be introduce* on the condition that the question of Juris diction over Hassawis etc should be settled in favour of the Shaikh. It would take some time to carry out the suggestions made at the bottom of the 2nd page of Captain Locl^s letter, regarding the production of agreements by the shaikh, correspondence with mainland Shaikhs etc - Shaikh Isa by the way has boon called up several times to produce the alleged agreement but has never done so. Captain Loch endorses Major Keyes' proposal about Khidmah i.ei that the Shaikh should be asked to compound it for Rs.300/- per mensem, subject to the proviso that his 'Ainire' do their Court work efficiently. I am not sure, however, whether the change in our position resulting from the capture of Baghdad will be sufficientsufficient to make you modify the views expressed in your letter 10284 dated 10th October 1916* If not it appears necessary to ask Government to extend the period of bringing the Order into force for another 6 months or one year as you may think fit.I -v- ho .

I certainly think it would be best to clear away the question of KHIDMA by a con solidated grant as has been proposed. But first it would be advisable to sound the Shaikh. In that case the question of the HASAWLS protection would be raised, see Loch*s letter dated 7th May 1917'.No.350. The Shaikh has a strong feeling for which I consider he has justification that he was jock eyed into his surrender of the rights of protection over subjects of neighbouring Arab chiefs, to which he did not intend his letter of July 16th 1909 to apply, it seems doubt ful whether he has any formal agreements with any of them, but this point should not be insisted on and it should be conceded generously subject, of course, to our intervention should any serious case of miscarriage of justice occur. Without this concession the Shaikh, I feel sure, will make trouble over the Order in Council.No OFFICE O?

Message ends. With reference to £ha± the above, I consider the reply is highly satisfactory in view of opposition from Sheikh’s advisers and gfceat difficulty of removing this opposition(?). It will be noted that the Sheikh accepts the whole, aKtdxixxxxiixKig and is willihg to accept all points, but asks for concession’s on two points. The first is practically ceded- vide sections 44 and 45 page 10 Order in Council. I would suggest that joint Court may sit as suggested by Sheikh. The point raised by Sheikh is therefore acceptable and I might inform him accordinly, if you approve maintaining ofi orww , / ^ Telegram P. From Bill,Bushire # To Political,Baghdad, No.250. J Dated 14th Feb.1919 With reference to Bahrein telegram No.0/25. I do not understand the last sentence in the Bahrein telegram, and am asking for a further explanation from the Political A ent. It is obvious that the Sheikh dees not wish to forego any cash receipts, and fears that other Arab rulers may regard the onsolidated payment in place of Khidma xxjc as a concession in some degree of his independence. There is a very small point about the Joint Court % • inasmuch as the Order in Council contains no power to the Political Agent to delegate either the power to sit in a Joint Court or indeed any other Judicial power.

Political Agent, Bahrain a O/'VFebruary 1st, 1/U9. Immediately on receipt of tbe wire autborieinr 1, me to announce the concession I wrote to 3haiVh 'Is^tellinr hi' I wished to aneak to ftim on an important and confiiential matter and X spent the intervening lay in carefully poin^ over th* Orier-in Council and making extracts to n-et objections I thought h© mivht make. K© received me at B.no 1.:% on &gt;aturday February lot alone~I fully expected one or more of his none to be pre sent and was very disappointed they were not. After the usual Compliments I opened the subject in t^e following way - That I wished to communicate a matter on behalf of His ^ajeotv'a Government and that I was ready to answer any roesiMe questions he miyht wish to ask and hoped that he would not hesitate to discuss any point that was not clear. That as was V's case with other British Courts in the o u if the time had now co^e when it was necessary to brin^ the Jou~t at Bahrain oh to the sane footing etc I then carefully explained all T considered necessary including the matter of T 'hidihaVand lastlv told him about the concession. He listened cuietly to all I had to sav and t&gt;en asked me if i would submit it all writing. I replied that this was only a?i informal visit so that I mipht talk things over with him and explain any points that were not cle r so that he nirht clearly understand the matte^ and that I intend ed to write to him officially on the subject. After a certain amount or general conversation on the subject he said h© could not take it all in nor yive an opinion on the matter till he had it in writing and had time to study it carefully. TT e told me h Q oould say nothing about Kbidma I therefore asked hi' i^ h@ wouli tell me what his objections were to the proposed arrangements, he seemed worried and fretful ani said he was quite unable to ex press any opinion or say what objection f h 9rQ was to it. I impressed on him the great benefit His Britannio Vajesty’s Government ha 1 given him in Jurisdiction and earnestly honei he would show his appreciation by accepting Governments proposal in the matter of Khidma that a refusal on bin part wouldnot prive n very p;ood iranreogion ani that in hi? own interogtq I be^^ed hira to prive a favourable anower leot t^ey miirht be tempted to recongider the Juriadiction natter. He replied that he know the Government were juat an-^ would deal .justly by Mm. aa it was obvioua that he would prive no oninion without having matters in writ ins?; I bade him ^ood-bye and by the end th© interview he seemed vreatly reassuredaoked him whether it would be convenient to him to renly to my letter by Monday a? the Order-in-Gounoil came into force then and he said yes he fculi reply by then. I a uid I honed the answer would be favour- * it able and he said please Cod in will he. II I therefore returned a^d drafted letter A nave J i'hia letter may noon un-neoessarily lonv but T was ahxious not to p;ive him an opportunity of brineinv up constant questions for discussion and so tried to cover the whole vround at one sitting by anticipating points of friction. [ would like to emphasise one or two points in mv letter (a) That I included the question of Khidma in the letter o'* the Order-in-Council so as to use the concession as a set o**^ to that. (b) That I have hrourht in the question o^ British ^nterven- Vion in case of injustice in his dealings with Arabs not Bahranis. (o) I clearly state that his Jurisdiction applies to those Arab rtu' 1 era with whom he is in treaty relationship. February 2nd. I invited Sheikh Jasir (3adbi) to tea and discussed t^e matter on these lines. That as in relimious matters he bad behincthim the Authority of the Koran. Go in earthly matters it was necessary for to have certain rulei by which 1 mi*ht be vuided. That were it not for the Koran people would say when he vave a judgment 'That is your orr opinion but I think differntly”.and that it is because people know that in his wisdom an i piety he is interpreting the lawsof the Prophotjso it ii neceiuary in earthly natters that T should have behind ne rules the internretation of w^io 1 ^ would lead to better justice. Anl so on. He raised the question of th e F'.^OO^ a nonth as a relirioue subject sayinv the roor should not have to nay ‘'or justice. T replied that I quite agreed with his view and indeed it was to safeguard those very poor that the hovern^ent were anxious to pay this sum. 31 nee the ^idawis wouli receive a nroner salary anl have no excuse for extortinv noney fro 01 the ooor who would in consequence pay one ruoee instead of ten.

(a) This Order-in-Council has become necessary in order to put the procedure of the Court at Bahrain on the same footing as all other British Courts in the Gulf - as will be seen it is in no way aims at any radical change or reduction of Your Excellency's authority or prestige and on the contrary it has increased your honour. The order applies to British subjects and to Foreigners with respect to whom Your Excellency has agreed with His Majesty that He should exercise jurisdiction. (b) -(l) It is an offence fof^ any person to violate or fail to observe any treaty made between Your Excellency,your prede cessors or heirs and His Britannic Majesty’s Government. (2) Any question of local customs may as heretofore be referret to the Majlis el Urfi. (3) Any dispute between pearling masters and divers may as heretofore be referred to Salifah Court. ^ (a) Any point of Muhammadan law may be referred to the C,azi. / (F&gt;) In cases where parties are Muhammadans the gourt may refer questions concerning probate of wills or administration of property to the ftazi for settlement under supervision of the Court. (6) When one of Your Excellency’s subjects desires to bring a complaint against a person under the jurisdiction o^ the British Government the Political Agent shall listen to the same and may with the concurrence of Your Excellency decide it himself or send it to a Court composed of your and his representative or if the defendent is a muhammadan refer it to the Qazi - a representative of the Agent being present. (7) When one of your Excellence’s subjects desires to bring a civil suit against a person under the jurisdiction of theBritish Government - The political Agent shall listen to the s^frie and may with lour Excellency’s approval decide the case himself or send it to a Court consisting of Your Excellency and his repre sentative or send it to the Majlis-el-Urfi or if it is between pearl masters and divers to Salifa|a Court. f 0 } Points of muhammadan law that may arise may be referred to the Qazi for decision. (9) When a person over whom the British Government has jurisdic tion brings his case to any of Your Excellency’s Courts and engages in writing to abide by the decision of that Court and later refuse to abide by that decision or to pay any fees or expenses. Thi-s is an offence against the Order-in-Council. (10) If a person over whom the British Government has jurisdic tion gives false evidence in any of Your Excellency’s Courts thi may be punished by the Political Agent by fine or imprisonment. (11) If any person over whom the British Government has juris diction smuggles or imports into or exports from Bahrain any goods for which Your Excellency should receive customs duty he shall be severely punished. (12) The same applies to any prohibited goods. ( 13 ) if any person over whom the British Government has juris diction mocks at religion or religious feast or ceremony he shall be punished. (14) Khidmah will be levied as heretofore in all cases in which v one party is a Bahrain subject and paid to Your Excellency. (15) In cases between subjects over whom the British Government has jurisdiction they will be charged different fees but to com pensate Your Excellency His Majesty's Government will pay into Your Excellency’s revenue R..500/- a month. This is done in order to make things easy and simple and as will be seen this is to Your Excellency’s advantage. (\r) Finally I have great pleasure in informing Your Excellency that His Britannic Majesty’s Government as a special act of grace and in token of its appreciation of your Excellency’s long friendship and in proof of its good intentions towards the Arab Rulers and particularly to yourself and relying on your justice e nuityA 4 . X equity have decided to grant Your Excellency juripdiction /)ver the subjects of those Arab Chiefs with whom Your Excellency is in treaty relationship and His Majesty’s Government has every confidence that Your Excellency will use this privilege with humane and enlightened methods and intentions in order that there may be no cause for His Majesty^Government intervene. I am sure Your Excellency will fully appreciate the necessity of putting the Bahrain Court on a proper footing and will understand the contents of this letter and will appreciate the consideration HisMajetty’s Government has shown to Your Excellency’s honour and prestige. Wishing Your Excellency long life with health and happiness. &gt;Copy of a letter dated Ipt February 1919 from the Political Agent,Bahrain to Shaikh ’Isa bin f Ali A1 Khalifah,Chief of Bahrain, '■ r ith reference to our conversation this morning with reference to khidmah I beg to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty's Government have instituted this with no intention of reducing Your Excellency's authority or against your rights but merely to make the matter simply a^d to save time and work and that Your Excellency's Amirs' fidawis may render efficient service and be recompensed adequately for the same - Nor is it any new thing since Your Excellency has been receiving khidmah up to date and will continue to do so as before on all cases relating to Bahrain subjects. Only in relation to subjects over whom Hie Britannic Majesty has jurisdiction does the intention apply. Ina pecuniary manner your Excellency's revenue will be increased firstly because the average on all cases during the past five years has worked out at R..9882/- per annum whereas His Majesty's Government have consented to pay in to your Excellency's revenues R',B800/- and in addition to this .Your Excellency will receive the usual khidmah from cases relating to Your Excellency's subjects. His Britannic Majesty's Government have as you know done everything in their power to respect the customs and privileges between your Excellency and the High Government and have shown special consideration in the latest concession with reference to your jurisdiction and I know you will increase the honour and esteeme of.the same Government immensely if you agree to this matter which will be for everybOdys’ convenience.Copy of a telegram NO.20-C of 1st February 1919 from the Political Agent,Bahrain to the Deputy Political Resident,Bushire repeated the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. Have had long interview with Shaikh who insisted all through on having the whole thing in writing and was very non-commital» His attitude was not in any way hostile or really obstructive and towards the end he appeared pleased and very friendly - as he insists of having it in writing I have selected suitable paragraphi from the Order-in-Council*and generally shown that no inovations have been introduced at which he might cavils. He wishes time to consider the whole matter and will reply to my letter early on the 3rd. I am taking him gently at present and doing all in my power to put things as simply and briefly as possible before him. I did not submit the matter in writing until I could form an idea from the interview what line I should take and while not wishing to be premature I have the impression from his attitude that the matter will be amicably settled. In answer to my remark on departure that His Britannic Majesty’s Government had shown him every consideration and granted him a big concession^ in jurisdiction out of personal friendship and esteem and that on that account I felt sure he would increase the confidence of the said Government in him by a favourable answer - he replied please God it will be good. I will telegraph fully when matters have taken a definite aspect.Copy of a letter dated February 1919 from the Political Agent, Bahrain to Shaikh 'Tea bin 'AH A1 Khalifah, Chief of Bahrain.

I am greatly disappointed,, that Your Excellency has been unable to give me a definite answer as you promised me when I had the pleasure of seeing you on Saturday. I beg Your Excellency not to disappoint His Majesty's Government over so small a matter on an occasion when that Government is ready to grant you so great a concession. I must today telegraph to my Govern- nent an(i T am m0s t anxious that the telegram sent should be to Your Excellency's advantage and that I should not have the unpleasant duty of informing that Government that their valued friend has not with gratitude at once accepted as they fully anticipated a measure which is only to Your Excellency's advantage.r —------- Copy of a telegram No.?,l--C of 3rd February 1919 froTi| thi Political Agent, Baiir^in to the Deputy Political Resident, Bushire repeated to the Civil Commissioner,Baghdad.

These papers relate to the subject of amending the Bahrein Order-in-Council so as to provide the Political Agent with the power to deport foreigners. 2* The Government of India regard the present position as an anomaly which should be terminated. The Sheikh of Bahrein has ceded jurisdiction over foreigners at Bahrein to the Political Agent yet retains the right to deport foreigners who prove them selves mischievous intriguers against the stability of his adminis tration, while the Political Agent exercises jurisdiction over foreigners, but cannot deport them, should necessity arise. Both powers should be in one hand and the Government of India are of opinion that this result would be achieved, if the amendment in the Bahrein Ordor-in-Council suggested by the Political Resident ingly to request that, if His Majesty’s Government see no objection, steps may bo taken to effect the amendment proposed. 3.

And truly I hold the belief in this respect, that undoubtedly the public in general understand that. But for the facility of Government in administering the legal provision, I say, Hamad Bin Isa bin All Al Khalifah, that it is my wish that the illustrious Government shall grant legal powers to the Political Agent, Bahrein, for the transports!tion of misohievious foreigners, and also that the Political Agent should enforce this law, when necessarynecessary, in order that there may be perpetual peace and quiet in my country. The said Political Agent should transport from our country the mischievous foreigners, or agitators, or the roughs known for mischief-making, or those who create disturbance among different classes, or persons acting or conspiring to bring about such disturbance. This is what was necessary and in conclusion, my True Friend l accept my choicest salutation.No. 3'}^ -S of 192S. British Residency and Consula to- General, Bushire, 25th September 1925.

S copy of the paper? referred to in the first paragraph of their letter was sent to the Foreign Office with this Office letter of the 20th July last, P.2729. In this connection I am to r^f:r to Secret Despatch to the Government of India ho.41, dated 15th Kcvemoer 1912 (copy sent to the Foreign Office 22nd November 1912) ^nd connected correspondence from which it will be c ’een that although the Qovernment of India had urged that pr:vision should be made i nit he Order for the de; ortati r of * ♦ foreigners, it was decided that in the absence of _ny specific delegation from the Sheikh of the necessar; powers no such provision should be oicdp, .nd the Order in Council in its final form provided for the deportation of British subject? only. Practical working of the Order has shown this to be a defect; and, as the Barques? Our:, on of Bedleot on is swa. e, recent events in Bahrein have emphasised the weakness in the position of the Political ^gent caused by this limitation of his powers of deportation. although the desirability of amending the Order to remedy this weakness has been apparent for some time, no proposals to that end have been submitted oecaiise the obstacle which prevented the inclusion in the Order in 1912 of any provision for the deportation of foreigners, i.e. the absence of special lelegaticn from the Bheikh, still existed. ThisThi s ?prc l al delf p-1i on hae, however, now been given by the present ruler cf Bahrein in his letter to the Political resident in the ler r ian '^ulf of the 31st Bay (vide enclosure in Government of India letter of 6th September' and the Resident has asked that the Crder in Council may oe amended to provide the Political -gent in Bahrein with the necessary powers for the deportation of undesirable foreigners. Viscount Peel -grees in the views expressed by the Government of India in support of this proposal, ,nd I am to request that, if Lord Curzon sees no objection, steps may be taken to giv 0 effect to Colonel Xnox T s proposal on the lines indicated in his letter cf the 3rd June, Ro.£57-B.

Sir, In reply to T 'Gur letter Bo.x .3603/33 of the 1st instant, relative to ti e Bahrein Order in Council, I am directed by the Rarquess Curzon of Xedlest.r to st-te, for the informat l on of Viscount Feel, that he has no objection to the amendments of that Crder in Council suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Knox in his letter of June 3rd, -which formed the enclosure in your letter under reply. 2. T f, however, an order for deportation is made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 22 of tie Order i Council, if amer.ded as ; reposed, it will become necessary to consider the bearing cf 'V paragraphparagraph 4 of that article f the amerded order. If the ''lovernmerit of India were to agree 'to receive such persons as it may from time to time oe proposed to deport from Bahrein, it is apprehended that no difficulty need arise. If, however, neither the co sent of the Government of India nor the government of any other portion of His Majesty's Dominions is fcrthpcming, the provisions of the Order in Council, as it stands, do not appear to provide for a place of deportation for a person who is not a British subject. 3. The secretary of *^tate will, therefore, oe glad to be informed of Lord feel’s views whether any further amendment of article paragraph 4 should be undertaken, and if sc, wnat form such amendment might take.

I have, etc., Sd. L. D. Wakely. The Under Secretary of ^tate. Foreign Office. 11614/67/91. Sir, Foreign Office, . 1 . 19th December 1923. With reference to your letter No.P.4408 of the 6th instant, relative to the proposed amendment of the Bahrein Order in Council, I am directed oy the oecretary of otate for Foreign Affairs to state that he would prefer to substitute for the phrase “country of origin”, which forms part of the sentence which Viscount Peel desires to add to paragraph 4 of article 22 of that Order, the phrase “country of which the person deported is a national'. 11 is only possible to deport foreignersforeigners to the territory of their own state, because no other state would be bound to receive them; if, however, the phrase 'country of origin' were to be adopted, the Court which passed sentence of deportation might interpret it as giving power to send a deportee to the country from which he came, even though he was not a national of that country. I am, therefore, to suggest that, if Lord Peel concurs, the amendment at the end of paragraph 4 of Article 22 should read 'or in the country of which the person deported is a national 'as the Court may think fit'. 2. In the special circumstances prevalent at Bahrein, it is not impossible that foreign countries may raise diffi culties about the reception of their nationals deported by order of the British authorities in that island. In such cases there appears to be no alternative, unless the order for deportation is to be ineffective, to the Government of India agreeing to receive the deportee. * e * • I am, etc., Sd.

In a few cases it has been necessary for me to take action to compel the presence before the Arbitrators or myself of witnesses or others living in the coast towns at a distance from Muscat. In these cases the good offices of the local-— governors have been sought or I have myself sent a summons by special messenger.

For every warrant Re 1 has been charged while no charge has been made for proclamations under III or IV. For every sale of property the percentage or poundage shown against V has been recovered.

He does not however at present exercise the power of granting new British P’oreign Office or Government of India pass- sports, nor of renewing British Foreign Office passports. British Subjects requiring new passports have to travel under the present circumstances to Bushire or Bundar Abbas to obtain them. 5. It is in my opinion of considerable importance that the Political Agent should have the power to grant new passoorts to British Subjects, of whom there is a large and constantly - - fluctuating community in Bahrain. As he is controlled by the Government of India, I would suggest for your consideration that i the Political Agent be supplied with a number of British Indian passports for issue to such persons, together with the requisite e number of blank passport forms. Should this be found impracticabl. it might be possible to supply the Political Agent with British Foreign Office passports similar to those issued by H.E.II’s.

It would appear from the above sections that the Political Agent is empowered to exercise most, if not all, of the ordinary powers exercised by H-B.M’s. Consuls/ in foreign - Countries in awity with His Majesty. 4. if this is true, then it would appear that several - anconalias exist in the system at present obtaining in this Agency Office. x-or instance, the Political Agent regulary exercises, or has definite authority to exercise,the following Consular powers:- The power to :- (1) Endorse British and British Indian Passports. (2) w Visa w foreign passports. # (3) Renew British Indian passports. (4) Endorse Ship^ articles. (5) Rote Marine protests.(3) a brass seal for tbi 3 Political Agency, similar (6) Register British Subjects. (7) Register births and deaths of British subjects. (8) Register marriages of British subjects. He does not however at present exercise the power of - granting riw British Foreign Office or Government of India paas- -ports, nor of renewing British Foreign Office passports. British Subjects requiring new passports have to travel under the present circuiastancee to Bushire or Bundar Abbas to obtain then. 5. It is in ny opinion of considerable importance that the ^ it at Agent should have the power to grant new passports to British Subjects* of when there is a large and constantly - - fluctuating community in Bahrain. As he is controlled by the - Government of India, I would suggest for your consideration that the Political Agent be supplied with a number of British Indian passports for issue to such persons, together with the requisite e number of blank passport forms. Should this be found impracticable it Bight be possible to supply the Political Agent with British Foreign Office passports sinilar to those issued by Consular representatives along the Persian littoral. 6- The power to renew British Foreign Office passoorts would, if conferred, be of considerable convenience t. British holders travelling to Europe via Iraq and the desert route. 7. .^mipply of Indian Revenue or Consular Starps would be - required according as this office is supplied with British Indian or Foreign Office passports. At present all fees are being recover -ed by neans of Indian Court Fee(/ Stamps; these are too large and unweildy for use on passports, for which they were never intended. ^ 1 ria 7 not b® ou t of place here for me to request to be supplied with (1) a Full page Foreign of fio8 , •it_^© Stamp, for regiatra- ti#n of British Subjects, for use on passports, which will save this office a great deal of extra writing and typing.

Applications for execution should bear the stamp fixed in Schedule II (1) (ft) of the Court Fees Act VII of 1870. 3 . Before any process is issued in any Court, the proper officer of the Court should calculate the amount to be paid as Court fees, and should give information of such amount to the person by whom the fees are payable. Such fees should be paid before the end of the fourth day after the day on which such information is given, provided that, if the office is closed on the fourth day, the fees may be received on the next day the office is open. The Court may, for sufficient reason, extend the time for payment. 3914 a 15945 l * Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. , 1927. No. of 1927. Fees.2 The stamps received for Court fees should be affixed to the application upon which the process is to be issued. After the fees have been received, but not before, the necessary summons, notice, warrant or other process should be prepared. When the process is to be issued beyond the jurisdiction of the Court, a note should be made on the process to the effect that the proper fee has been levied. 4. When an execution creditor seeks for sales of immovable properties situate at different places or villages, there should be one warrant and one proclamation of sale only, with as many copies as there are places or villages, and only one process fee should be charged for the warrant and another for the proclamation. 5. No Court fee is leviable upon a certificate of a decree-holder under Rule 2 of Order XXI of the Civil Procedure Code, although such certificate declares that the judgment creditor has received a smaller sum or a thing of less value in discharge or a larger sum due under the decree, or in complete discharge of the decree. 6 . Any copy which, on its first presentation, has been duly stamped, and of which the stamp has been cancelled, may, if other wise admissible, be used in the same or any other proceeding without a fresh stamp. 7. The first application for the summons of a witness is exempt from stamp duty (see section 19 (xiv) of Act VII of 1870). Any further application of the summons of the same witness should be stamped in accordance with Schedule II, Article 1, clause (a) or (6), as the case may be. 8 .
