Dear Miss Waterlow, Newsam has passed to me your letter of 30th May about the Sultan of Muscat's desire to employ 10 Arab refugees for certain technical and teaching posts. I am afraid that the only records of ex-Palesti- nian Officers we have available in London are those re uired for computation of retiring benefits and there are no detailed reports which would enable us to recommend suitable candidates from the roll of officers. I would mention that there were over 2,000 teachers on the establishment oi the Palestine Bduca' tion Department, the majority of them being Moslems, and you will arpreciate that in the absence of confidential reports on their service we have no material for selection. This position.also applies to doctors and there is the added difiiculty in the case of these personnel that the offer must be made sufficiently attractive to draw the right type of. practitioner. We assume that the Sultan has in mind Moslem doctors and that presents another difficulty as there are not many of them in Palestine. We understand that Palestinian doctors are doing very well in the Arab areas of Palestine and the neigh bouring Arab Territories and earning anything from £100 to 200 a month. We have heard.of one Palesti nian doctor who was offered an appointment in Bahrein at a monthly salary of £150 plus free quarters and the right of private practice. We can suggest one doctor who would probably be prepared to accept an appointment on these terms and I enclose such particulars as are available regarding him. He could probably suggest the name of another Palesti nian doctor who would be prepared to accept on the terms mentioned. jf it is considered that the recruitment of teachers through the United Nations Belief for Ar^D Refugees will be a slow process we suggest that an advertisement be inserted in local newspapers in Jerusalem and Nablus, inviting applications Applicants should be required to produce Certificates of Service issued to them by the former Palestine Government. Alternatively, contact might be made with Mr. Labib iuleihan, Hue Jean d'Ark,.Beirut, Leoanon, who was Chairman of the Palestine Civil Service (2nd Division) Association. We understand that he is keeping in touch with the various centres oi ^de re resentative bodies of the former Government Ofiicers and he will no doubt be aDle po supply names of teachers willing to accept employment in Bahrein. I am sorry that we are not in a position to be more helpful in this matter and I must apologise ior the delay in replying to your letter. This is due to attempts to obtain more detailed information.

If so would they be prepared to meet all or any part of the financial cost involved by themselves or would it be essential for any resettlement in these states to be financed from outside sources. 4. ?/hat are long terra economic possibilities of absorbing them on land or in occupations other than oil. 5. What numbers if any might be accepted for settle ment in immediate future. 6.
