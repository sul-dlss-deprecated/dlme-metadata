The letter covers the preparations, the defeat, and subsequent retreat of the expedition to Soor [Ṣūr]. The author outlines the measures he believes are required in order to return to the offensive and fit out the detachment at Deristan for what he understands to be its intended purpose. Also described in the letter is the case of a boy taken from Bombay five years previously, and forced into slavery; this is used as evidence of the Beni Bow Ali tribe's piratical activities.The Captain further outlines the case of two officers he has returned to Bombay; he intends to charge them for deserting their troops. He also makes special commendations for the services of Assistant Surgeon Fallow.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711596.0x00000d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
