Dear Burkett, You doubtless know that the Standard Oil Company of California have an oil concession close to Bahrein. They also have extensive areas in Arabia over which they can pros pect for oil. During a recent talk with people of the Standard Oil Company, it appeared that they are interested in the use of aircraft in Arabia. At the moment, they feel that they could usefully employ aircraft between Bahrein and the area on the mainland in which they are nov/ drilling. I understand that their chief office in this part of the world is at Jedda, and that they have frequent convoys across the desert from Bahrein to Riadh and Jedda, and nov/ use desert lorries. Communication from Bahrein to Jedda by air would be a great asset to them. Similarly, if they find oil in the centre of Arabia, they might also need air services operating to the North and South of this main route. The Standard Oil Company have heard of the successful way in which we have carried out work for the Iraq Petroleum Company in Palestine, and on aerial surveys, and they have therefore asked our advice as to the practical possibility of such aerial developments. They seem anxious to have our opinion and advice in regard to:- (a) Laying out the necessary landing grounds. (b) Erection of wireless stations. (c) Erection of camps at certain aerodromes. (d) Specifications of aircraft that we consider suitable for their purposes, and (e) Some idea of capital and operating costs. It is possible that they have asked similar questions from other people, and I should be glad to know whether the Government have any wishes as to whether we should help them. You v/ill remember that I v/rote to you a few days ago, saying that the Deutsche Luft Hansa were sending a machine, with the German Ambassador in Baghdad on board, to Riadh and Jedda, and it seems to me possible that if we v/ere not to undertake this work for the Standard Oil Company, some foreign help v/hich the British Government might dislike, might be called in. As you know, we have our hands rather full at the moment, but there may be a political aspect of just as much importance as the commerical. Before going any further, therefore, v/ith the Standard Oil Company, I shall be very glad to have your views.1058 16th February, 1939 (T.
