F~om ansTfcrs received to ^y enquiry it is clear that the lar^e differences in the number of vessols shown proceed chiefly from three causes.

ON THE TRADE OF KUWAIT FOR THE YEAR 1912-1913. {1st April to 31st March) General .— Kuwait is a rising 1 port on the Arabian side of the Persian iGulf with a population estimated at some 50,000 souls, but the trade of the port is not wholly absorbed by this population, the greater part of it being for the interior of Arabia. The inhabitants of the town are almost all seafaring folk whose prosperity depends entire ly on pearlfishing. They send out from 700 to 800 diving-boats to the Persian Gulf pearl- banks each year, the crews of which are found partly locally and partly from Bedouin and others who visit the place for the diving season only; the crews are made up by about one-half of each class, and the total number of men and youths afloat during the season must amount to between 18,000 and 20,000. A good pearl-season increases the wealth of the port and stimulates trade, and, as the last 3 or 4 seasons may all be classed as either “ good ” or “ very good ” there has been a considerable and steady expansion in trade, a result also due in part to the exceptional state of peace among the tribes of the hinterland and the consequent better security and safety of the caravan routes. Kuwai tis, however, are improvident and careless to a degree, holding with profound sincerity that the mercy of Providence extends even to a benevolent blindness to their thriftlessness and negligence. They make no provision for possible rainy days and consequently any serious fluctuation in the pearl-market, always a most speculative one, affects the well-being of the port most seriously. But as Kuwait is becoming more and more a distributing centre of goods for Nejd and the important towns of Central Arabia, and an increasing number of merchants appear to be taking to a more stable form of trade than pearls, there is hope that the figures in future years will continue to expand, provided always that the caravan routes remain moderately safe and secure for the transport of merchandise. The security of these routes depends very largely on the relations between the Ruler of Kuwait, the Amir of Nejd (“Bin Saudand Ibn Rashid, the Ruler of Jabal Shammar; for the last two and a half years the three have been at peace with the result now apparent in the trade figures of this port. In the year under review the total trade has amounted to the record figure (statistics are only available for nine years) of Rs. 85,58,370 as com pared with Rs. 62,94,452 last year, an increase of 35’96 per cent. Even this figure does not represent the whole increase, for a shipment of some 55,000 packages of rice, which should really have fallen into the import returns under review, was delayed and arrived a few days after the close of the year to which these returns relate. A particularly interesting view of the total trade of the port is furnished by an inspection of the figures for the last eight years which I give below in tabular form. My object in eliminating the value of “Arms and Ammunition^ and “Specie'’ from both Imports and Exports is to arrive at the value of actual legitimate trade in commodities. The trade in arms and ammunition was a specula tive one which has dwindled to very small propor tions as a result of general British measures against the traffic in the Gulf, whilst Specie is an item which fluctuates enormously for a variety of reasons and whose inclusian rather obscures an appreciation of the real trade of the port. The above table further shows how seriously the pearl- market affects the figures as speaking generally 1905 and 1906 were good seasons, 1907 and 1908 bad, 1909 and subsequent years very good or good- Total Imports of Principal Articles. {By Buggalows.)

The rise in the imports has been general, the most noticeable being in arms and ammunition, coir and coir rope, specie, sugar, tobacco, and barley, whilst that in the exports is due to pearls and specie. The follow ing table gives the percentage of the imports and exports of each country for the last three years:— Imports. Exports.

Arms and ammunition — Show an increase of over a lakh of rupees. This is due to the impor tation of some arms and ammunition by the Ruler of Kuwait and others, permits for which were ob tained by them. Piece-goods —Show a falling-off of Rs. 4,73,208. As remarked in last year’s report there was then an unprecedented increase in this item and the decrease this year is attributed to the local market being congested with old stocks. Rice —Shows a decrease of Rs. 1,35,623. This is due, as stated above, to the usual supply having arrived too late for inclusion in this year’s statis tics. Specie—Hhe increase of over 10 lakhs under this item represents part of the proceeds of pearls and the heavy import of coin was due to the divers demanding their shares and large advances for the coming season. Sugar, loaf and soft —Show an increase of over 2^ lakhs which is said to be due to increased im ports and demand, particularly in Central Arabia. Wood for building boats. —This was formerly imported by buggalows but owing to uncertainty of delivery and urgent local demand, a large quantity was imported this year by steamers and the Rs. 1,41,370 appearing in the return repre sents its value. Imports by Buggalows, Barley —Shows an increase of nearly half a lakh of rupees which is said to have been caused by the rise in price, as the quantity imported was only slightly in excess of last year. Chandal —Show an increase of Rs. 52,000. As the town is gradually expanding and numbers of new houses being built an increased number of chandals were imported during the year, while the price has also greatly advanced. Dates, Wet —Last year owing to a poor date- crop in the Shatt-al-Aiab gardens a lesser quan tity was imported and the increase of Rs. 33,000 this year is due to a rise in price of the usual quantity required. Kero sine Oil —Rs. 10,000 represent the cost of oil exported by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, of Mohammerah, and is a new item of trade. Tobacco. —The increase of Rs. 72,000 in this item is caused by local demand and higher prices. Wood for building boats. —Shows a falling- off of Rs. 21,000. This is due to the diversion of part of this trade to steamers. Exports by Steamers. Pearls —Show an increase of Rs. 44,000 which is due to good pearl season, and the fact that owing to a fall in prices at the end of the season, the pearls were not shipped thence but brought back to Kuwait for shipment to Bombay. Specie. —The increase of over 5 lakhs in this item is due to cash remittances made in payment of goods imported. Exports by Buggalows. Ghi —Shows a falling-off of Rs. 68,000. Owing to increased local demand and high prices no ghi was exported this year. Tea. —Shows an increase of Rs. 35,000 which is said to be due to increased smuggling to the Persian Coast. Root building and Labour. —Some 120 boats, big and small, have been built during the year. Of these about 100 are for pearling and the re mainder for traffic and bringing fresh water from the Shatt-al-Arab. The value of these new boats, which is estimated to be over 4 lakhs, is not in cluded in this trade return. Labour and living seem to be getting extremely dear in Kuwait. Boat carpenters demand Rs. 5 to 7 per day besides food, measons Rs. 4 to 6 per day, coolies if engaged on daily wages are reluctant to work for Rs. 1-8 and even Rs. 2 per day. The same may be said of all labour and crafts and there has also been a corresponding rise in the price of most commodities. It* is due largely to the reckless extravagance of the gpearling popula tion. Openings for Trade. —There seem to lie good opportunities for British India Traders in Kuwait. At present the whole trade of the port is in the hands of Arabs and Persians who are ignorant andI 3 have little or no knowledge of conducting com mercial transactions on any large scale in a business-like way. Their business relations with a few exceptions, are confined to Karachi, Bom bay and Calcutta. As they are unacquainted with foreign languages they are heavily handi capped in expressing their wants accurately and are consequently at the mercy of tb^ir few cor respondents in India, who are generally Arabs settled in Bombay, perhaps only a shade less ignorant than themselves. As may be imagined double or treble handling of transac tions must result, which, while affording com missions to the intermediaries, raises prices locally and does not always produce the goods really required. British Indians established here with a knowledge of Arabic would reap considerable profits. The attachad returns will give an idea of those articles which find most favour what in Kuwait and intending traders can see there from particular class of goods are likely to give them the best appor- tunities. The following articles may be said to command a good sale here :— Enamelware, furniture, gold and silver thread, piece-goods, rice, coir and coir rope, sail cloth, coffee, haberdashery, wood for building boats, etc. Post and Telegraph.-—Tho, port and merchants, however, labour under two disabilities, the want of a regular Post Office transacting all kinds of Postal business, and the absence of telegraphic communi cation. The former is an urgent necessity and as the want has been represented for some years, it is hoped that the Oovemment of India will see their way to establishing an Indian Post Office at an early date, Telegrams can be sent from the Turkish telegraph office at Fao, or the Indo-European Telegragh Departments office at Bushire, but in both cases there is a sea-journey, which makes the prompt receipt of despatch of messages uncertain as well as expensive. Landing arrangements .—The landing of cargo from steamers is carried on by the Shaikh's Cus toms. It is admitted by Shipping Companies that their steamers get quicker despatch at Kuwait than at other ports in the Persian Gulf, while there is also less pilfering and theft from cargo between ship and shore and in the Customs warehouse. Landing charges are recovered from consignees at the following rates All other casks, bundles, cakes, jottas, etc., big or small, are charged at Bs. 1 each, irrespective of contents. Shipping and Navigation. —Until January 1918 the British India Steam Navigation Company continued to maintain a fortnightly steamer service to and from Kuwait, sending extra steamers as inducement offered. Seeing the growing im portance of the place in February they decided to send their steamers weekly from Bombay and fortnightly from Basra. The Arab Steamers, Limited, also maintains a fortnightly service to and from Bombay. The number of steam and sailing vessels that entered and cleard the port during the year is given in the attached shipping return. Freights. —Freights during 1912-19-3 were B,s. 10 to Rs.14 per ton to Bombay and £ 1-7-6 to £ 2-0-0 for London and European ports by the British India Steam Navigation Company.

V q^ V \h Your letter of M^ay has been handed on to me as tjab sub- ject is being dealt with in this office. The Residents circular letter of 2 February is explanatory of the rules contained in Foreign Office Circular no.12579 of 5 May 1910,and shows how they should be applied to the Gulf. Para.2 of your letter,UP GULF. The first paragraph of the F.O.Circular is explicit on this point and there is nothing in the Resident's letter to modify this. When a vessel enters with cargo , the last port of call does not enter into the question zlja.ll. She is shown as entering with cargo from the furthest port where cargo was embarked for the port in question. For instance,if S.S.Barjora comes to Kuwait with cargo after having wandered round the Gulf,you would show her in the register as ' entered' from Bombay; but you would not show her as ' cleared' when she sailed away in the evening for Basrah,, unless she took in cargo from Kuwait for India or Europe or somewhere outside the Gulf ,and was not going to call in at Kuwait on her way down Gulf.If she took in cargo from Mu- hammarah or JJasrah,yon would not count her as cleared. DOWN GULF. Similarly, if the vessel clears on the downward voyage with cargo the next port of call does not enter into the question atkll. The ship is shown as clearing with cargo for the furthest port for which she carries cargo,i.e. in the case of S.S.Patiala returning from Basrah to India,she would be shown as cleared to India(Bombay). The intermediate operations of leaving the port on the * up Gulf voyage and coming back again qn the down Gulf voyage'T-~n same country,as is not unreasonable in a cul-de-sac like the Gulf,these intermediate operations are,to all intents and purposes,of the 'coasting” order and, under paragraph 5 of the circular, are rightly excluded. In other words, the small amounts of cargo shipped between Kuwait and Basrah, Bushire and Lingah, Bandar Abbas and Muhammarah are to be ignored for purposes of tonnage and shipping returns; the point being that 10 carboys of vinegar,50 bags of henna ,20 tins of ghee, 5 bundles matting etc. do not justify 1500 - 2000 tons being added to the tonnage of the port, and are properly coastal cargo. We wish to get rid of the system of double entry,v/hich appeared in the returns of some ports, get all the Gulf ports to calculate on the same system,and at the same time conform to Board of Trade rules regarding vessels 'in ballast' and 'coasting trade”, and the Circular was issued to explain the method. The 'prohibitory clauses',as you call them,have,I think,been misread by you. You probably refer to this:- '( TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE RETURN.) But if the last port of k call(in either case referred to) is within the Gulf,such i/ vessels should be entirely excluded from the return of en- trances.' This refers to vessels 'arriving in ballast' at Kuwait (i.e.without cargo for Kuwait) from^say,Bushire: and by the Foreign Office Circular,ships in ballast count from the last port touched at, not from the original p ort of departure,as in the case of ships with cargo. It also refers to vessels bound up Gulf taking away cargo for ports inside the Gulf, e.P-;. S.S.Barjora taking in cargo at Kuwait on the upward voyage for Muhammarah or Lingah etc. According to the Residents instructions,you would not ,in thegttwo examples, show the vessel^ as 'entered in ballast from Bushire,' or wxuxx /. fy/fi x ux- muxxaimuax-axx, but you WO Uld exclude themf them altogether. As you say nearly all your vessels bring cargo from outside the Gulf and take cargo to outside the Gulf, your statistics should be normal. Maskat shipping tables for 1912-.t5 have just seeing to work well under come in and the new system. z aJb-No. of 1913. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 1st June 1913.

Unlese there are political reasons to the con- trary, I should think it would he easy for you to au thorise despatch of one copy of the report direct from Koweit to London, on the strength of/ordera of 1905 and the practice in Bahrein, that the statistics should be in sterling, and as far as possible all quotations, or mention of values in the body of the report, also in £. sterling - not rupees. Business people in Snglahd are not used to thinking in Rupees, and the figures become doubly cumbrous. (3) , There would also be no harm in Koweit following the usual Foreign Office instructions regarding preparation of reports i.e, sketch map, introductory notes on carriage and ou^ency, weights, measures, populations of towns in districts. The expressions 'this year' and 'last year' should not be used. (4) . If you agree, he might make the necessary al terations and additions in the present advance copy: and then send one copy direct to &amp;BKstan the Foreign Office. (4).

Cloth is also sold in pieces and bales.REPORT ON THK TRADE OF KUWAIT for the year 1913-1914. (1st April to 31st March.) INTRODUCTION. The year under review was an unfavourable one from the trade point of view. There was scarcity of rain in the early part of the year (when it is generally expected) both on the coast and in the hinterland, which made grazing scarce and fodder unobtainable except at prohibitive prices. This reduced the condition of the cattle and other live stock and resulted in very little desert produce being available for sale in Kuwait town. Then the pearl season, the chief local industry, was also a bad one, both as regards production and prices obtainable. Some of the pearl merchants who had previously made large purchases were badly affected by a slump in the European market and persons of lesser impor tance engaged in this means of livelihood were re duced in many cases to selling their household pro perty in order to make existence possible. These successive misfortunes had naturally an injurious effect on the trade of the port. Total Trade. The total trade of the port during the year has amounted to £485,238 as against £570,558 in 1912-1913, a decrease of £85,320 or 14 95 per cent. The reasons given in the intro ductory remarks above are mainly responsible for this large reduction. The ensuing year promises better, for a copious supply of rain is reported to have fallen throughout the desert which will improve the condition of the cattle and other live-stock and will help to give stim ulus to trade. Unfortunately great things are not expected of the ensuing pearling season, though there is no sign of decrease in the number of boats preparing for departure to the banks. Imports and Exports. The imports and ex ports during the year amounted to £370,817 and £114,421 respectively as compared with £438,298 and £132,260 in 1912-1913, giving decreases of 15 39 and 14'24 per cent respectively. The following 175 F. &amp; P. D. table gives the percentage of trade with the various countries for the last three years — Country. Imports. Exports. 1911- 12. 1912- 13. 1913- 14. 1911- 12. 1912- 13. 1913- 14.

Reasons for abnormal increases and decreases in some of the commodities are as follows IMPORTS BY STEAMERS. Arms &amp; Ammunition. Show an increase of £75,009 which is due to increased quantities of ammunition imported by the Ruler of Kuwait, permits for which were obtained by him.Marine Stores. The increase of £1,626 in this item represents cost of stores brought by the Sheikh of Kuwait for his water-steamer. Piece-goods. Show a decrease of £28,364 which is attributed to poverty of the people conse quent on a bad pearl season and scarcity of rain. Rice. In 1912-1913 the yearly supply of rice was not received in time for inclusion in the figures for that year, and the increase of £34,646 in the current year is due to this fact. Specie. Shows a falling off of £106,160 which is due to the failure of the pearl season and the | dullness of the pearl market owing to which pearls remained unsold. Wheat Flour. Shows an increase of £2,364. Indian flour is now being imported in larger quantities than formerly. The poorer classes are said to prefer it to flour made locally by hand-mills which is moreover more expensive. IMPORTS BY BUGGALOWS. Barley, Owing to scarcity of grazing and fodder a large supply of barley was imported for the use of camels, etc., and the increase of £9,400 here is due to this cause. Dates Wet. The reason assigned for a decrease of £4,700 under this head is that a lesser quantity was imported, there being few purchasers from the interior during the year under review. Tobacco. Shows a decrease of £4,333 which is attributed to the enforced abstention of the general mass of the people from luxuries owing to poverty resulting from the bad pearl season. Water. Increase of £2,933 is said to be due mainly to increase in the number of Bedouin which have visited the town during the year. Elbows for boats. Increase of £4,080 is said to be due to an increased quantity imported for Basrah. EXPORTS BY STEAMERS. Pearls. Show a decrease of £20,633 which is due to the failure already mentioned. Specie. Shows a falling off of £7,124 which is due to the general set-back in the imports. EXPORTS BY BUGGALOWS. Astrakhans. Increase of £4,043 is probab ly due to increased slaughter of lambs for want of grazing and fodder. Ghi. Shows an increase of £8,460. Larger quantities than usual appear to have come in from Hail and Nejd. Rice. Shows a falling off of £2,333. Owing to the late arrival of the rice for Kuwait already referred to, a lesser quantity is said to have been exported. Shipping and Navigation. The port is served by the British India Steam Navigation Companies’ Steamers weekly from Bombay and fortuightly from Basrah. The vessels of the “ Arab Steamers Ltd. ” and the now Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Com pany also call occasionally on their outward and inward voyages. The harbour is well buoyed and besides the exis ting beacon On the Ras-al-Arz promontory another has recently been erected under the orders of the Government of India on Kubbar Island some 30 miles South East of Kuwait town as an aid to Navi gation. Its height is 30 feet above the water and it is visible from about 11 miles distance. The number of steam and sailing vessels that entered and cleared the port during the year is giveu in the attached shipping returns. POPULATION AND INDUSTRIES: PUBLIC HEALTH. The population of Kuwait is estimated at about 50,000 souls but the town is visited for trading purposes by a large number of Bedouin and people from all parts of Nejd. The only two important local industries are pearlfiahing and boat-building and the prosperity of the people depends almost entirely on the former. About 42 pearling and cargo boats were built during the year at an estimat ed value or £10,000 as against 120 boats of an approximate value of £^6,700 in 1912-1913. These figures have not been included in the trade statis tics. The public health of the port has been very good throughout the year and no disease has occur red in epidemic form with the exception of small-pox which was prevalent in October and November 1913. Customs Administration- The Sheikh’s Cus toms are superintended by an Arab Director, native of Kuwait. Tbe management seems to work very satis factorily and no complaints have reached the Political Agent during the ytar under review of any attempts to recover enhanced duty or any other illegal tax from British subjects and others. The landing arrangements also rest with the Customs Depart ment and they are as satisfactory as could be desired, though the scale of charges appears to be rather high as compared with those at other Gulf Ports. The high cost of living and the dearness of labour accounts for this. The Sheikh is said to have order ed hand power cranes for shipping and landing heavy packages at the Customs wharves, but they have not yet arrived. No complaints or difficulties arising from pilferage between ship and shore have occurred during the year which is satisfactory in view of the large amount of trouble experienced at other Gulf Ports from this cause. The Customs premises have recently been considerably enlarged by reclamation and the addition of new sheds. They are capable now of accommodating thousands of packages with out exposing them to risk of any kind.ol •ved lies’ rom ;d. ” om- and 1C boat ding ople tant ding nost and nat- an hese atis- very car- ■pox 913.

Merchandise is transported to the interior solely by camel caravans and the following were the rates during the year for the most impor tant places: — For. , Rate. Per. Zulfi, Boreidah and .

Note :—For cases of tea, haberdashery, etc., the rate* were 50 per cent higher than those quoted above. The Sheikh levies a tax of $. 1 to $. 2 (2 to 4 shillings) on goods exported to the interior, the follow ing being the scale :— Coffee . . $2 per camel load of 3£ bags. Sugar . . $ l per came', load of 2 bags. Rice . . Free. Piece-goods §2 per camel load of 2 his. or Bdls. Iron ware . §1 per camel load. Kerosine oil 01 P er camel load of 6 cases. In addition to the above a further tax of $ ^ per camel is said to be extorted in transit by Bedouin Sheikhs and another § ^ per camel at Anaizah ostensibly for the safety of caravan routes. Freights. Freights during the year for Kuwait were at £0 16 0to£100 per ton to Karachi and Bombay by the British India Steam Navigation Campany, limited, and £ 0 13 4 to £0 16 0 per ton by the Arab Steamers, Limited. Neither of these lines booked cargo from Kuwait direct to any European Port in 1913-1914. Exchange. The only coins which fluctuate in value in the market are Turkish liras and Maria Teresa dollars. The former were exchanged at an average rate of £0 18 2 per lira during the year 1913-1914 and the latter at the rates given below for the 12 months - April • £ s. d. 9-1S-4 per 0100 .

The trade statistics are compiled from the manifest Books of the shipping companies and although endeavours are made to form as correct an estimate of the trade as possible the figures must be received with some reserve since great accuracy is not possible. But it is certain that the volume of trade is not over-estimated either in the steamer or the buggalow traffic for care has been taken to value the different arti cles at their cost price rates and were proper statis tics available, as at Persian Ports, it is almost cer tain that they would show much better results than those disclosed by the attached tables. Moreover no record is available of unmanifested goods which are imported by merchants who periodically visit Bombay on commercial business. This alone would probably give a substantial increase in the imports by steamers. W. G. GREY, Lieut,-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. Kuwait, Dated the May 1914.19 i ^7.’' 7 PORT OF KUWAIT.

I:iT.jODUvriOh . Kuwait 1 r a prinjipality on tne Arabian side of the rersian dulf, 60 miles from the mouth of the Hhatt-al-Arab /po and 13d miles by sea and 90 miles by lanci from basrah. Tile JijC, e* ^ population, whijh is estimated to be over 40 t 0GG t is larger th r -n any other port on the Persian Gulf. Kuwait is also an entrepot of goods for Nejd ana some of the important towns of central Arabia and in a lesser degree for Aaahur, llindiyan, and other neighbouring minor ports on the Persian toast. Its trade is not therefore influenced by local conditions only, but also by cli- -matic and economic conditions of those countries and by the safety of the caravan routes to the interior. The trade of the port has, lihe that of other countries, suffered during the last three yearn, but in spite of the con- -tinuance of the war, shortage of tonnage, blockade, and other reatrijtions it has appreciably recovered during the year under review. -Shis is due to three causes via speculation on the part of the local merchants, general ^ise in the px'ice of almost every article, and to the safety of the caravan routes which were, with the exception of a few spasmodi c,raids, comparatively safe throughout the year and facilitated the transportation of merchandise under permits to non-blo msaded towns of -entral Arabia and ITeju. The pearling season, an industry on which 5u per cent of the inhabitants chiefly depend, wan also a succersful one, though a lesser number of boats participated in the fishery ow- -ing to the shortage of men. The catch was up to the average of past years and good prices wei'e also realised. TOTAL fdADB . The import* amounted to £471,713 and the exports to £162,630, the former shewing an increase of 61.42 per cenc and the latter of 35.27 per cen- or a total of 54.14 per cent as compared with 1916-16. The chief items which have contri buted r *JLJ •» „ .fl .! W 1 1 Hi 1contributed towards it are piece-goods, rioe, wheat, and sugar under imports and pearls and specie under exports. Reasons for abnormal inoreases and decreases in some of the articles are given below :~ Barley . Was imported of the value of £3,786. Formerly this came from Persia but owing to a shortage in that country, it has this year been imported from India. Coffee. Shows an increase of £6,546. Large stocks are stated to be still on hand. S namelware . Shows a decrease of £1,355 which is due to the dif- -ficulty of obtaining the commodity. Pie 3 e-good,-, . Show an enormous increase viz: £116,830. It is due to the rise in the price of every kind of cloth and to increased exports to certain distrijts which formerly used to draw their supplies from elsewhere. Rice. Increase of £13,757 Is due to the rise in p.ice and also to the fact that a lesser quantity was imported in 1915-16 . S ugar. The increase of £31,130 is attributed to advance in price an increased exports to the interior. T amarind . Shows an increase of £4,707 which is due to its export to Basrah and the Persian coast. Tea. The quantity imported was smaller than in previous years, the increase of £2,124 being due to rise in prices. v \ Twist Sc Yam. Lesser quantity was imported last year and the the imorease of £1,175 is attributed to ifc. Wheat 8c Wheat Flour . Show an increase of £12,550. This is cue to the failure of crops in Persia whence it was imported before w ood for boats.

Most of the volume consists of copies of trade reports for Kuwait (for each financial year from 1912-1913 up to and including 1916-1917), which are submitted by the Political Agent, Kuwait (Captain William Henry Irvine Shakespear; Lieutenant-Colonel William George Grey; Major Robert Edward Archibald Hamilton). Imports include arms and ammunition, rice, specie [coins], and sugar; exports include pearls, specie and tea. Each report records the total value (initially in rupees but later in sterling) of the trade for the year and discusses in detail the increase and decrease in trade of specific goods. Further items of discussion in later reports include public health, shipping and navigation, and transport.Each report also includes in its tables of statistics the corresponding data (i.e. quantities and values of goods) for the two preceding financial years, as well as the countries from/to which the principal articles were imported/exported. The rear of the volume contains some trade statistics for the financial year of 1917-1918.In addition to trade reports, the volume includes correspondence between the Political Agent and the British Residency at Bushire regarding occurrences of 'double entry' in the shipping returns of Persian Gulf ports. The Political Agent is instructed to include in his returns only those vessels that either bring cargo to Kuwait from outside the Gulf or depart with cargo taken from Kuwait which is destined for somewhere outside the Gulf.Also included are the following:a letter, dated 22 July 1913, from the Foreign Office to the Political Agent, Kuwait, informing him that his trade report for the year 1912-1913 will not be published at present because of political reasons;a request, dated 20 January 1917, from the Chief Political Officer, Basrah (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Zachariah Cox), for the Political Agent to provide information regarding British and foreign trade at Kuwait, in order to assist a commission that has been appointed to enquire into the condition of British trade with Mesopotamia and the Gulf ports (the file includes a copy of instructions for the commission).The Arabic material in this volume consists of three items of correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, Chief Political Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Sind, Collector of Customs, Karachi</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000014#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
