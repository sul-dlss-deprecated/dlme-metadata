History. Ancient History .—It is unnecessary and impracticable in this report to do more than touch upon the ancient history of the area concerned, which is the stretch of country along the Euphrates from Raqqa to Fallujah. It suffices to say that, like the rest of Mesopotamia, it has seen the rise and fall of the most famous Empires of the past. As long ago as 1450 b.c. the Eastern Marches of the Egyptian Empire extended as far as Hit on the Euphrates. At a later period the country came in turn under the domination of the Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian and Roman Empires. It was finally engulfed by the tide of Muhammadan Conquest which swept up from Makkah and Madinah in the seventh century a.d. as a result of the preaching of Muhammad. Later again when the governing centre of the Muhammadan world shifted from Makkah and Madinah to Damascus, under the Omayyad Caliphs the country found another change of masters, and when the Abbassid Caliphs in their turn rose to power and Baghdad became their capital, the area in question formed part of their dominions. Finally, after other vicissitudes and changes of fortune, the country came under the rule of the Ottoman Turks, who had been ruling over it for nearly 400 years at the time of the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. From the brief summary given above it will be apparent that to enter into any detailed description of the march of events would involve the writing of a history of Empires, and to follow the almost bewildering changes through the centuries would serve no useful purpose in the compilation of a purely military report designed for use at the present day. The exact date of the Turkish Conquest was a.d. 1534. Modern History .—Since that date the country along the Middle Euphrates, although nominally under Turkish control, has actually been independent of any central authority until comparatively recent years. The Badawin Arabs have ranged the country at will, taking toll of the cultivator and of the caravan, and by their depreda tions, which the central Government were not in a position to check, any security or prosperity were rendered impossible, and cultivation existed merely on sufferance. It was not until the conclusion of the Crimean War, when the Porte found itself with a large army and plenty of money (C4206) B2 at its disposal, that any serious effort was made to exercise real control in the country. Omar Pasha, then governor of Aleppo, at the head of a considerable body of troops, marched down the Euphrates and took possession of Dair-al-Zor, which was then held by Fallahin Arabs who had enjoyed semi-independence under Anizah protection. It was about this time that the caravan route down the Euphrates from Aleppo to Baghdad was opened to traffic and travelling by this route, although a somewhat speculative venture, became comparatively speaking safe. This policy of enforcing the Turkish authority was carried on by Midhat Pasha, who built forts to protect the Euphrates navigation and the caravan route to Aleppo. The fort at Rawah on the left bank of the Euphrates opposite Anah is a case in point. The people of Rawah have always enjoyed a reputation for lawlessness, and they were never brought to heel until after the construction of this fort which dominates their villages and cultivation. Despite periods of insecurity the Turkish power gradually grew, and cultivation has considerably increased in recent years along the Euphrates valley. The riverain cultivators have usually found it advisable to pay a form of tribute to the larger Badawin tribes in return for protection, or at least non molestation. Travelling along the caravan route has been more or less secure, although the area between Anah andRaqqa has always been, and still is, a happy hunting ground for inter tribal raids between the Badawin themselves. On the outbreak of the Great War the Euphrates was gradually developed as a line of communication by the Turks, who brought both troops and stores by river from Jarablus to Fallujah and even to Samawah and Nasiriyah. Although necessitating frequent posts, this line of communication was not interfered with to any extent by the tribes. It was the selected line of advance for the Turkish “ Yilderim ” or “ Lightning ” Army, which was to advance down the Euphrates in 1918 for the recajiture of Baghdad. This scheme (and it is somewhat doubtful if it were ever intended to push it seriously) was frustrated by our advance in Palestine, and the troops intended for Baghdad had to be diverted to meet it. When it became apparent towards the end of February, 1917, that the fall of Baghdad could not long be delayed the Turkish forces on the Lower Euphrates at Samawah retreated upstream, first to Fallujah and later to Ramadi. Fallujah was occupied by our force on 18th March, 1917, and on 28th September of the same year we occupied Ramadi, capturing the entire Turkish force there, numbering about 3,300 of all ranks and 11 guns.On 7th March, 1918, Hit was occupied, the Turkish force there having retreated to avoid envelopment. This force was, however, rounded up near Khan Baghdadi between 26th and 31st March, on which occasion over 5,500 prisoners, 12 guns, and 57 machine guns fell into our hands. After this disaster the Turks had no considerable forces on the Euphrates, but the length of the line of communication discouraged any further move upstream on our part, and the advance in Palestine subsequently rendered such move unnecessary. After the battle of Khan Baghdadi no permanent advance was made beyond Hit until after the armistice, when Anah and Dair-al-Zor were occupied without opposition. As our advance proceeded, Civil Administration was under taken, and Political Officers were established at Ramadi, Anah, Albu Kamal and Dair-al-Zor. The Ramadi division consisted of the old Turkish Qadhas of Fallujah, Ramadi, Hit, Anah and Albu Kamal, which places were administered by Assistant Political Officers. Anah, Hit and Fallujah were latterly placed in charge of Arab Civil Officials. Since the conclusion of the armistice with Turkey in the autumn of 1918 various influences have been at work shaping recent events on the Middle and Upper Euphrates. The chief of these influences has undoubtedly been the desire for Arab independence. For some years before the war there had been in all Arab-speaking provinces of the Turkish Empire a strozig movement for the establishment of an autonomous self- governing Arab State. This movement took definite shape in 1915, when the Sharif of Makkah threw in his lot with the Allies, and began actual hostilities against the Turk. The delay in conclusion of a definite peace with Turkey, unavoidable though it undoubtedly was owing to the various and conflicting incidents to be considered, created a feeling of unrest and uncertainty in the Arab mind, particularly in Syria where the foundations of the new Arab State were being laid at Damascus. In the autumn of 1919 the British forces in Aleppo and Damascus evacuated those towns where an Arab Government was set up. On 11th December, 1919, an Arab force under a certain Ramadhan al Shallash occupied Dair-al-Zor, imprisoning our Political Officers there. The reason given for this advance was stated to be that the boundary of the newly formed Arab State had been fixed by the Peace Conference as the Wadi Hauran. This particular incident ended by the release of our Political Officers, but the Arab Government, whilst disclaiming any knowledge of or responsibility for the actions of Ramadhan al Shallash, was allowed to retain possession of Dair-al-Zor pending a final settlement of the frontier by the Peace Conference. Encouraged by their successful occupation of (C4206) B 21 4 Dair-al-Zor, the representatives of the Arab Government on the Euphrates after December, 1919, spared no effort to create trouble and insecurity within our boundaries, by active pan-Arab propaganda amongst the tribes, both riveraine and Badawin. Their object was undoubtedly to compel us by raiding our extended lines of communication to fall back on Hit, leaving them as boundary the Wadi Hauran. As it was, we were compelled temporarily to evacuate Albu Kamal, which was, however, re-occupied after slight resistance on 26th December, 1919. The Aqaidat, Jaghaifah and the Albu Nimr and Albu Mahal sections of the Dulaim were eventually influenced by the dissemination of this pan-Arab propaganda to such an extent that they adopted a definitely hostile attitude towards us. At first their activities took the form of cutting the telegraph wires and sniping our outposts in the vicinity of Albu Kamal, but later they attacked convoys, besieged our garrison at Albu Kamal for several days and became a serious menace to our lines of communication. This necessitated the despatch of a strong column from Ramadi which eventually reached Albu Kamal, and had the effect of stabilising the situation, which had threatened to develop unfavourably downstream. After reprisals had been taken on the tribes, both by punitive columns and by air, all the Aqaidat sections, with the exception of the Shaitat, came in and made submission in March, 1920. Fines were imposed in money, rifles, grain and sheep, which were paid up in full by April and guarantees given for good behaviour of these sections in the future. Shaikhs of the Shaitat sections of the Aqaidat eventually, through the overtures of Turki Beg ibn Nigris of the Aqaidat, came in to Salahiyah in April and received the Government terms, but failed to comply with them, and were consequently subjected to further punitive measures. On 5th May, 1920, a conference was held at Ashar (14 miles downstream of Mayadin) between the British Military Com mander and Political Officer on the one side and fully accredited representatives of the Syrian Government on the other. After amicable discussion a provisional boundary was fixed, crossing the Euphrates at a point midway between Albu Kamal and A1 Qaim, although the representatives of the Syrian Government still claimed that the Wadi Hauran was the true boundary. This new boundary was sound from the point of view of admin istration, as the whole of the Aqaidat tribe came under the Syrian Government, whereas the whole of the Dulaim remained under British administration. On 8th May, 1920, Albu Kama! was formally handed over to the Syrian Government without incident, leaving our most advanced post at A1 Qaim.(C4206) B 3 5 ®the ireate ictive e and is by ek on ; was, amal, :e on fehal the xtent Is us. ?raph amal, )n at Jnace patch iched ition, )am. iltive ption 1920. which good iually, [aidat, nment uently : miles Corn- edited After ’ossmg il and nment ndarj'. jdmin- ler the named over to r most Consequent on our withdrawal from the Albu Kamal district there was considerable tribal activity on the road between A1 Qaim and Hadithah. Our troops were sniped from long range and further attacks on convoys and our garrison at A1 Qaim took place. Finally, in June, 1920, our troops were withdrawn to Anah. Between June and August, 1920, followed a brief spell of quiet on the Upper Euphrates, which was eventually broken by the murder of Lieutenant-Colonel Leachman, C.I.E., D.S.O., near Khan Nuqtah on 12th August by Shaikh Dhari ibn Dhahir of the Zoba’ and his two sons Khamis and Sulaiman. At this time the whole of the Middle Euphrates was in insurrection and there was an undercurrent of restlessness in the Dulaim division, bred partly by events on the Upper Euphrates during the previous spring, which ended in our subsequent withdrawal to Anah, and partly by one or two temporary successes gained by the Middle Euphrates tribes which were in insurrection. The murder of Lieutenant-Colonel Leachman precipitated the Zoba’ into joining the insurgents and for a short period the probability of the Dulaim throwing in their hand against us was by no means very remote. It was then that the influence of Shaikh Ali Sulaiman of the Dulaim became apparent. He was instrumental in preventing disaffection spreading to his tribe, and succeeded in holding in check the turbulent elements which were inclined to follow the example of the Zoba’. In face of no visible support on the part of the Government this was no easy task. In August he proceeded to Anah with a tribal following to support the Assistant Political Officer of that town which was threatened by the hostile attitude of portions of the Albu Nimr section of the Dulaim and Aqaidat which had entered Hawaii on the left bank opposite Anah. The townsmen of Rawah joined hands with the hostile tribesmen and compelled the Assistant Political Officer, together with Ali Sulaiman and his tribal following, to evacuate Anah and retire downstream on Ramadi. Meanwhile the Zoba’ had cut the railway and telegraph lines between Baghdad and Fallujah, and Ramadi was isolated, Shaikh Dhari ibn Dhahir of the Zoba’ was subjected to intense aerial bombing and eventually fled northwards into the Jazirah, and in May, 1921, still remained a fugitive from justice. The flight of Dhari and the re-establishment of railway and telegraphic communication with Fallujah by columns operating in this area produced a good effect, and on 19th September the leaders of the hostile Zoba’ sections came in to Fallujah prior to proceeding to Ramadi to make formal submission to the6 Political Officer of the Dulaim division. This marked the end of the insurrection as far as it concerned the Upper Euphrates. On 4th October Hit was re-occupied by a detachment of our troops without incident, and in April, 1921, an Arab Qaimmazam was established at Anah under the Mutassarif of Ramadi. The advent of the new Arab Government of Iraq has up to the time of writing (May, 1921) produced no material change in the political situation on the Upper Euphrates, although there is a general atmosphere of interest in future possibilities. CHAPTER II. Geogbaphy. Area.—-The area dealt with in this volume is about 22,000 square miles in extent. It may be described as the stretch of the Euphrates between Raqqa and Fallujah with an arbitrary boundary in the desert on both the right and left banks of the river. Boundaries .—Owing to the absence of suitable landmarks in the desert, the boundaries are best appreciated by a reference to the key map in the pocket at the end of the volume. General Description .—The area in general consists of a steppe like desert plateau with rocky outcrops much resembling the South African Kopjes, some of which rise to a height of 200 to 300 feet above the level of the surrounding country. During the late autumn, winter and spring, this desert after good rains is covered with grass, various sorts of desert wild flowers, spinifex (salt bush) and various forms of shrubs which provide excellent grazing for camels. At this period too, water is to be obtained from depressions in the ground or from the bed of Wadis where it has collected after rains. During this season movement is easy, and Badawin Arabs principally from the Anizah and Shammar tribes wander from tract to tract in well- defined areas grazing their extensive flocks of camels and sheep and indulging in the exhilarating pastime of the tribal raid. About the end of April or the beginning of May the desert becomes parched brown and dry. Except at certain wells known to the Badawin, no water is to be obtained, and move ment, except for small parties mounted on camels, becomes impossible.(C4206) B 4 River Euphrates —(a) General Description .—Through the centre of this inhospitable area flows the River Euphrates, following a general south-easterly course. Along its banks and those of its tributaries are to be found stretches and patches of cultivation. At Albu Kamal the date cultivation belt begins, and the further down river one proceeds the m&amp;ro favourable does the climate become for this class of agriculture. The river in the course of centuries has carved out for itself a trough-like depression through the desert. According to the resistance offered by the geological formation of the land, this valley varies in width from over 10 miles to a narrow precipitous gorge scarcely a mile across. In the wider sections of the valley the river meanders from side to side, frequently changing its course and forming numerous islands and rapids in the river bed, as well as ledges of rich alluvial soil near the banks where cultivation is carried on. At Albu Kamal the river valley begins to narrow, and until Anah is reached, the course of the river is due east ; from here it again resumes its normal direction, and after passing Hit, the gorge gradually opens out until the neighbourhood of Ramadi, where the river flows through a fertile irrigated alluvial plain, until the limit of the area is reached. As far south as the Tel Aswad reach the river bed is rocky, with numerous ledges and rapids, but beyond this point the river bed and the banks on both sides consist purely of alluvial soil. The country on the left bank of the river is known to the local inhabitants as the Jazirah or the Island, so called as it lies between the Tigris and the Euphrates, and that on the right bank is known as the Shamiyah, as it is situated on the Sham or Damascus side of the river. These terms will be used in this report when referring to either river bank. (6) Floods.—T\\e liability of the Euphrates to sudden inundation is a factor which military engineers should always bear in mind. There are two flood seasons, during the first of which the rise in the river is caused by the sporadic but often violent winter rains. These rises are usually of short duration only, and occur between the months of November and February. The permanent flood season begins about the middle of March, and continues to the end of June. The river is usually at its highest during May, and there is a considerable daily decrease during the month of June. During July, August and September there is a steady decrease, the lowest water level usually being reached about the middle of October. The river then remains stationary until November, when rains may cause freshets involving a rise of8 5 to 6 feet in 48 hours, in many cases leaving the channels and crossings altogether changed. In July and August the channels are continually altering and this is the most difficult period of river navigation, for which September, October and November are the best months. ' At present no bridges other than boat bridges have been constructed ; these are liable to drag their anchors or even to be entirely broken by a serious flood. To prevent this it may be necessary to remove a bridge entirely when such floods threaten. River Gauge Readings (Ramadi Gauge:). Month. Mean Monthly Readings for the Year 1920. Month.

Steamers and country boats of shallow (fraught can proceed upstream at all seasons of the year as far as Flit, but upstream of this place, although sailing directions have been prepared to Dair-al-Zor, it is unlikely that navigation for steam or petrol-driven vessels would be a commercially paying propo sition, owing to the number of rapids to be passed and the numerous obstacles in the river bed, both natural and artificial. With a full river the current is too strong to allow of the profit able use of steam or sailing vessels above Hit. (d) Bridges .—Only two bridges across the Euphrates in the area under report, one at Dair-al-Zor and the other at Ramadi. The former is capable of taking traffic up to 4| tons, i.e., L.A.M.B. cars, while the latter can take field guns, but not L.A.M.B. cars. The Dair-al-Zor bridge is formed of floating shakturs which are not anchored, but are held in position by ship’s chain cable laid across the bow and stern of each shaktur. The ends of thecable are made fast to tree trunks buried on either bank. It i^ said that this bridge could be cut for the passage of river craft but the process would be very lengthy. Since the British evacuation of Dair-al-Zor, the general condition and state of repair of the bridge is uncertain. The bridge at Ramadi is situated l^- miles downstream of the town, and consists of 71 boats of native construction, which are anchored to the bed of the river. The bridge is about? 300 yards in length and can be cut to allow passage of river craft. (e) Fords. Owing to the fact that the river bed is con tinually changing its course, it is impracticable to state from year to year where the site of a ford will be. At the time of low river, however, there are always stretches of river easily fordable between Raqqa and Ramadi. In 1918, during the period of low water, places were found between Ramadi and Fallujah where the water in the river was only 3J feet deep, and between Ramadi and Hit where the depth was only 3 feet. Between Raqqa and Hit considerable stretches frequently occur in the low water season where the depth of water does not exceed 2 feet. For detail of fords, see Chapter VIII, Communications. ’ ’ , (/) Ferries—Two ferries of any importance exist, one at Sinn adh Dhibban (9 miles west of Fallujah) and the other at Hit. The ferry at Sinn adh Dhibban consists of a motor-driven mahailah, with two similar craft moored to either side, and is capable of carrying one L. A. M. B. car or two ordinary cars, 50 men or 12 horses. There is a well-constructed landing stage on either bank with good approaches. The Hit ferry is a large shaktur worked by a steel cable from either bank and takes 20 minutes to cross and return. It is capable of carrying 12 horses or 60 men. At the time of writing (May, 1921) the cable is broken. In addition to the above, most villages and settlements along the river bank possess one or more shakturs in which both men and animals can cross the river in time of flood. In the absence of shakturs, the inhabitants are accustomed to cross the river by swimming, supported by inflated skins or bladders. Tributaries. There are only two tributaries of any import ance, the Balikh and the Khabur, both of which join the parent stream on the left bank, the former in the neighbourhood of .Raqqa and the latter about 8 miles upstream of Mayadin. Wadis .—Numerous Wadis from the desert uplands join the river on both banks. They are dry most of the year,10 but after heavy rain, which may occur miles away in the desert, they are liable to sudden and frequently quite unexpected floods which render them impassable for any time from one or two hours up to as much as five days. Details regarding such of these Wadis as may affect the movement of troops are given in Chapter VIII, “ Communica tions.” * Irrigation. —The three principal methods of irrigation on the Upper Euphrates are :—- (а) By “ Karuds ” or water lifts. (б) By “ Naurs ” or primitive water wheels. (c) By canals. (а) A “ Karud ” is a water lift constructed on the river bank, usually where it descends steeply to the river, and is worked by a pony or mule. The water is lifted to the bank in a large skin and carried away in a small narrow channel from which smaller distributaries take the water to the cultivation. Where the Karud is the only form of irrigation, water can only bo carried from 1 to 1|- miles inland from the river. (б) The construction of a “ Naur ” or water wheel is peculiar and deserving of a brief description :— A series of masonry weirs is built out into the river for a distance of about 10 yards and along the top of the weir is constructed a masonry trough. A water wheel is built on to the end of this projection into the river. The force of the current turns the wheel on which is a series of small buckets lifting the water. On the turn over of the wheel the water is emptied into a projection from the trough and thence conveyed through ordinary irrigation channels on to the land to be irrigated. The wheels work day and night and each one appears to irrigate up to about 5 acres. The cost of maintenance is said to be about Rs. 500 per annum. A masonry dam is built out into the river in prolongation of the weirs, to raise the water level and to ensure a sufficient current at low water to turn the water wheels. A series of these weirs and dams built out from both banks towards the centre of the river tend to raise the water level and to produce a swift current in the centre of the river between the heads of the dams, rendering the passage of boats both difficult and dangerous. In many places the weirs and dams are ruined and submerged, further increasing the difficulties of navigation. “ Naurs ” are not used downstream of Hit. (c) Canals. —Considering the possibilities of cultivation there are remarkably few canals of any size on the Upper Euphrates.The tribesman himself will cut a small channel leading from the river for purposes of irrigation where this is practicable, but unless the Government displays some interest and activity in the construction of a large canal he will show little initiative in this direction. The chief canals leading from the stretch of Euphrates under report are the Aziziyah, Saqlawiyah, Abu Ghuraib, Radh- waniyah and the Habaniyah escape (incomplete), details of which are as follows :— (i) The Aziziyah canal leaves the right bank of the Euphrates half a mile upstream of Ramadi and flows in a general direction of south-south-east into the Habaniyah lake 5 miles south-east of Ramadi. Both banks of the canal are extensively cultivated. (ii) The Saqlawiyah is one of the largest and most important canals on the Euphrates and is of modern construction. Its intake is 6| miles upstream of Falluj ah on the left bank of the river and it flows in a general easterly direction terminating in the Aqqar Quf. The canal head is controlled by sluice gates and has a concrete blockhouse on either bank, where it is crossed by the main Baghdad-Fallujah road by a stone bridge. The construction of the Saqlawiyah canal attracted many Dulaim sections from the banks of the Euphrates, and it waters one of the most fertile tracts of country in the whole area. (iii) The Abu Ghuraib canal leaves the left bank of the Euphrates 4 miles downstream of Fallujah and proceeds in a general easterly direction until due south of Khan Nuqtah, when it flows northwards. Both banks are cultivated by Zoba’ sections. (iv) The Radhwaniyah canal has its head on the left bank of the Euphrates 9 miles downstream of Fallujah and follows the general direction of the river until it reaches Imam Hamzah, when it tails off into a series of distributaries. The Zoba’ are the chief cultivators on both banks of the canal. (v) The Habaniyah escape, which, had it ever been com pleted, would have had its head on the right bank of the Euphrates half a mile downstream of Ramadi, was a Turkish enterprise under the construction of a British engineer. The European war brought this work to an end, but it was intended to act as a reservoir for the storage of surplus water in the flood12 Towns .—The only towns of any importance are along the river bank. A brief description of them is given below :— Anah .—Is situated on the right bank of the Euphrates, 119J miles by river above Hit, and 192 miles downstream of Dair-al-Zor. General Description .—Steep cliffs descend precipitately from the desert plateau to nearly the level of the river, leave a flat ledge of ground from 100 to 300 yards in width along which passes the Aleppo caravan route immediately under the base of the cliffs and along which for a distance of about 7 miles straggle the town and date gardens of Anah. The houses are interspersed amongst gardens and date groves, and a very noticeable point is that every available inch of ground is under some sort of cultivation. Cultivation itself is carried out with a thoroughness and care seldom seen in this country, the fields evidently being sown with selected seed, and being free from weed. The cultivation is all irrigated from “ Naurs.” On the high ground north of the town close to the Euphrates is a ruined castellated building, formerly a fort, built in the first half of the last century to command the river approaches. The Sarai or Government building is situated in the east end of the town ; it is not well constructed for defence, and is commanded from the high ground to the north as well as from the left bank of the river. On the left bank of the river opposite the western end of Anah is the village of Rawah, with fruit gardens and date groves ; on the hill above is a fort, capable of holding one company, and known as the Qasr al Zaim. Water .—Unlimited at all seasons from the River Euphrates. Commerce and Supplies .—Local supplies of cereals, vege tables, dates and fruit are barely sufficient for the needs of the inhabitants and passing travellers to and from Aleppo. There is no regular bazaar, but shops in private houses are scattered here and there throughout the town. In normal times wheat and barley are imported from the Dair-al-Zor district by shakturs. Sheep are plentiful and at least 1,000 a month could be obtained from the surrounding tribes. The only local industries are the manufacture of farwas and abbas. A farwa is a sheepskin coat made with long or short sleeves and much after the style of the poshteen obtainable on the Indian frontier. Ihe price ranges between Rs. 10 and Rs. 45, according to style and quality. 1 he Anah abba or Arab cloak is woven locally from sheep’s wool. It is rather distinctive, being parti-coloured in brown and white. Many of the abbas are exported to Baghdad andother places in Iraq, where they find a ready sale. The price is about £T.2 for an abba of good quality. Fiwl .—Fuel in Anah is scarce and very dear, being normally obtained from the surplus dead wood in the gardens and date groves. Grazing. —The grazing depends entirely on the rainfall in any particular year. In the winter of 1918-19 there was sufficient grazing in the vicinity of Anah for one cavalry regiment, whilst during the winter of 1919-20 grazing was practically non-existent. Transport. —About 400 donkeys from the town. C ommunications .— (а) By River. —Downstream only in shakturs to limit of area. (б) By Road .— (i) Baghdad-Aleppo caravan route passes through Anah. Passable for L.A.M.B. cars in good weather. (ii) Track along the left bank upstream to Raqqa (205 miles). Passable for pack transport. (iii) Track across desert to Baghdad (142 miles). Passable for Ford vans in good weather. (iv) Track across desert to A1 Qaim and Albu Kamal (50 miles). Passable for Ford vans in good weather. (v) Track across desert to Mosul (145 miles). Passable for Ford vans in good weather. Inhabitants. —-The population of Anah is approximately 15,000 and the inhabitants are nearly all Sunni Muhammadans. About 20 Jews, all engaged in trade, live in the town. The prevailing atmosphere in the town is one of parochial self- sufficiency. The community is practically self-supporting and appears to take little or no interest in the outside world. It is, however, curious that many younger sons of Anah families are to be found scattered through Iraq holding minor positions, chiefly clerkships, in the Civil Administration. Camping Grounds. —Unlimited both up and downstream of the town. A landing ground for aeroplanes exists 3 miles south of the town and was fit for use in April, 1921. Administration. —Headquarters of a Qaimmaqam under the Mutassarif of Ramadi. Albu Kamal. —Albu Kamal is a small modern town of about 100 houses situated on the right bank of the Euphrates, 58 miles upstream of Anah. The town stands on a compara tively new site, 1 mile inland from the river, to which position14 it was moved about 25 years ago from the old site which was on the river bank and in danger of destruction, as the river began to cut out a new course. The ground between the town and the river is low and marshy and is cultivated with a few fruit gardens, but there are practically no date trees. There are two main streets running at right angles to each other, and the houses are mostly of stone construction. Albu Kamal is regarded as the centre of the Aqaidat tribe and is the market town for grain, which is grown in considerable quantities in this area. Water .—Unlimited from the Euphrates. 'Supplies and Commerce .—There is a small Badawin bazaar from which the usual commodities can be obtained. The chief product of the surrounding country is grain, which is brought into Albu Kamal and exported downstream. It is estimated that the area under cultivation produces 5,000 tons of wheat, barley and maize annually. Crazing .—Grazing depends entirely on the quantity of rain. In a normal year in the winter months there is extensive grazing on both banks of the river, but in the winter of 1920-21 it was practically non-existent owing to the shortage of rain. Transport.—200 to 250 donkeys could be produced and also a few camels and mules. Fuel .—Imported from Dair-al-Zor district. C ommunications .— (i) On the main road between Baghdad and Dair-al-Zor passable for all arms except in wet weather. (ii) Track across the Jazirah to Mosul (185 miles). (hi) Track across the desert to Kubaisah (112 miles). Inhabitants. Total population of town approximately 750, of which practically all are Sunni Muhammadans, with a very few Jews. Camping Grounds .—Unlimited on either side of the town. A landing ground for aeroplanes was made 2 miles north east of the town when we were in occupation, but it is not known what the condition of the ground is to-day. Administration.—In Turkish times Albu Kamal was the headquarters of a Qaza. —- Dair-al-Zor. —Dair-al-Zor is a town of some 1,200 houses situated on the right bank of the Euphrates, 192 miles upstream °/ AmA i and 115 downstream of Raqqa. The town stands on rising ground above the river opposite an island, and is some what European in appearance, having good roads, publicgardens and welldit streets. There is one long main street, which is fairly broad and contains a few good houses, including the Government buildings, three khans and also the bazaar. Fruit gardens exist both on the right and left banks and the islands upstream of the town are fertile in the production of tamarisk and willow, which are used for fuel. A bridge consisting of country boats crosses the river in the centre of the town (for description, see page 8). Immediately upstream of the town on the right bank stands the citadel which is on a high hill and in an excellent position to command the surrounding country and the town. Water .—Unlimited from the Euphrates. Commerce and Supplies. —Dair-al-Zor is a town of consider able commercial importance. It is the half-way house on the Baghdad—Aleppo road, the Mosul—Aleppo road crosses the Euphrates at this point, the downstream traflic from Birijik has its distributing centre at Dair-al-Zor, and it is the market town of the Khabur tribes. Most of the inhabitants derive their income from the trade routes which pass through the town, and are generally pros perous. A little cultivation is carried out on the left bank, where a small quantity of grain is grown, but the town itself is entirely dependent upon purchasing from external sources, although cultivation shows a tendency to increase. The merchants of Dair-al-Zor purchase the supplies of grain, vegetables, fruit and sheep brought in by caravans and down stream river traffic, and after retaining a sufficient quantity for the demand of the town, export the remainder downstream. It is estimated that the approximate annual export of grain is 7,000 tons. The bazaar is large and well stocked, Manchester cotton goods, tinned food and fresh provisions being obtainable. There is a large horse market in the town where thoroughbred animals are brought by the tribesmen for sale. Two salt pans exist, one on either bank of the river, but are used for town consumption only. Transport .—Approximately 1,500 donkeys 1,000 camels, and 150 mules could be produced if necessary. Grazing .—Depends on the rains. Usually unlimited, chiefly on left bank. Fuel .—Fuel is brought in large quantities from the upstream islands, which are prolific in tamarisk and willow. Fuel is also exported downstream.Communications. —Caravan route to Aleppo (208 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars. To Mosul via Ain al Ghazal (162 miles). Passable for Ford vans in good weather. To Mosul via Balad Sinjar (176 miles). Passable for Ford vans in good weather. To Nisibin vid the Khabur river (145 miles). Passable for pack transport. To Raqqa vid left bank Euphrates (80 miles). Passable for pack transport. To Anah vid left and right banks Euphrates (128 miles). Former passable for pack transport, latter for L.A.M.B. cars. Caravan route to Damascus (224 miles). To Homs vid Tadmur (230 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars. Telegraphic communication with Aleppo. Inhabitants. —The total population of Dair-al-Zor is estimated at 15,000, and consists chiefly of Muhammadan town Arabs. There is a small Christian colony of Syrian Catholics, and a few Jews. Camping Grounds. —Camping ground for a brigade due west of the town. A landing ground for aeroplanes was made when we were in occupation half a mile south of the town, but it is quite probable that it does not exist to-day. Administration. —In Turkish times Dair-al-Zor was the headquarters of a Mutassarif, and during the British occupation the town and district was placed in charge of an Assistant Political Officer. Since the Syrian occupation a Mutassarif has been installed. Fallujah. —Fallujah is a small town on the left bank of the Euphrates 43^ miles to the west of Baghdad. A better description would be an overgrown village, in that the majority of the houses are little more than mud huts. Fallujah is practically devoid of cultivation, with the exception of the very small date garden on the north-west side of the town, which is scarcely worthy of mention. The town possesses a mosque, three khans, a sarai and one large house which was at one time the home of a Turkish official. Generally the town gives the impression of cleanliness, the streets, such as they are, being in good condition and well kept. Fallujah has attained a little importance from the fact that it is the terminus of the narrow gauge railway which runs to Baghdad, but this line is not capable of supporting itself, much17 less showing a profit, and it is understood that it will shortly be closed down. Water. —-Unlimited from the -Euphrates. Commerce and Supplies. —Fallujah town produces practically nothing in the way of supplies, but as it is the market town for the grain-growing tribes of the Saqlawiyah and other adjacent canals it would be possible to purchase fairly large quantities of wheat, barley, rice, maize and vegetables. Sheep can also be obtained here as the semi-nomad tribes of the district bring their flocks to Fallujah for sale. There is a small bazaar of about 50 shops, from which such commodities as cotton goods, soap, cigarettes, matches, etc., can be obtained. Approximate amount of supplies available for troops during the year:— Sheep ... ... ... ... ... 3,000 Tons. Fruit 27 Fuel 252 Vegetables ... :.. ... ... ... 200 Barley ... ... ... ... ... 500 Hay and Bhoosa ... ... ... ... 500 Grazing. —In a good year when rain is plentiful grazing during the winter months almost unlimited. In the winter of 1920-21, however, owing to lack of rain there was practically no grazing whatever. Transport. —Town could produce only 50 donkeys. Fuel .—Most of the fuel is imported from upstream or Baghdad. A certain amount of camel thorn is gathered locally for fuel. Communications.—To Baghdad by narrow gauge railway (40 miles). To Baghdad by road (42 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars. To Ramadi via Sinn adh Dhibban and right bank Euphrates (18 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars. To Musaiyib (48 miles), (left bank). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars in good weather. Inhabitants. —The total population of Fallujah is estimated at 1,200, of which number practically all are Muhammadans. One or two Jewish and Christian families live in the town. Camping Grounds. —Sufficient for a force of any size upstream of the town. There is a landing ground for aeroplanes half a mile east of the town which is kept in good condition.18 Administration .—The town is under an Arab Mudir who is responsible to the Mutassarif at Ramadi. Hit .—The ancient town of Hit is on the right bank of the Euphrates, 119 miles downstream of Anah. It stands on a mound on the river bank which is precipitous to the plain and slopes more gradually towards the river. A tall leaning minaret near the river bank provides a conspicuous landmark which can be seen for miles. The town is surrounded by a loop-holed wall and gives the impression of being built for defence. There are large date and fruit gardens on both banks of the river upstream of the town and a little cultivation downstream. A raft ferry worked on a steel cable crosses the river at Hit, but in April, 1921, the cable was broken and no one appeared to be in a position to say when it would be repaired. A more depressing, malodorous, dirty-looking spot than Hit it would be difficult to imagine, and it owes these attributes to the bitumen wells and furnaces, the smoke from which causes a hazy atmosphere to hang over the town. The surrounding ground is also redolent of bitumen and sulphur. Despite the unpleasantness, however, it is said to be decidedly healthy and local sages state with conviction that on one occasion it saved the town from an epidemic of cholera. There are seven bitumen wells in the neighbourhood of Hit, five on the right bank, 1 mile west of the town, and two on the left bank. These wells are believed to have been worked for at least 5,000 years. Herodotus mentions the bitumen wells of the town, then known as Is. It has been identified with the Ihi of the Babylonian inscriptions, the Ahava of Ezra, and with the 1st, from which a tribute of bitiunen was brought to Thothmes III, according to an inscription at Karnak. Water .—Unlimited from the Euphrates. Commerce and Supplies .—Hit owes its very existence to the presence of the bitumen wells from which it derives its com mercial importance. They are seven in number, five on the right bank, 1 mile west of the town, and the other two on the left bank. The quantity of bitumen is practically unlimited and the amount of production depends entirely on what the townsmen choose to draw from them, but the average output is between 150 and 300 tons per month. In appearance the wells are pools covered with black viscous -liquid, the surface of which is disturbed in the centre by an undercurrent of water which bubbles up at brief intervals charged with sulphur, the overflow being carried away from the main pool in a stream to the river ; the liquid bitumen is removed from the pool byhand. A light tramway runs from the pools to the river bank and the bitumen is carried in a trolley either to the boat-building yards downstream of the town or to be shipped for export. Adjacent to the wells are lime kilns in which bitumen is used as fuel. The chief uses to which bitumen is put locally are binding of bricks, covering of baskets and caulking of boats. There is a large boat-building yard downstream of the town on the right bank, where boats after construction are loaded with bitumen and lime and despatched up or downstream for sale with their cargoes. These boats, known as shakturs, are made by interlacing branches of tamarisk and mulberry trees with basket work of leaves and straw and the whole is eventually covered with a mixture of bitumen and sand. On an average they draw 22 inches when laden and about 6 inches when empty. The monthly output of lime from Hit is estimated at about 300 tons and the majority is exported both up and down stream. Salt pans also exist half a mile west of the town, the annual output being 300 tons. There is a small bazaar in Hit of 90 shops where the usual necessaries are obtainable. The only thing grown locally at Hit in any quantity is fruit. On both banks of the river there are 48,000 date trees and in season apples, figs, and pomegranates are obtainable. The following table shows the monthly imports into Hit for the consumption of the town and Kubaisah :—- Rice Wheat ... Barley ... F uel Bhoosa ... Vegetables Sheep ... Tons per month. 60 ... 120 80 ... 150 ... 160 ... 25 200 per month. Grazing .—The grazing ground around Hit is very poor and fit for camels and sheep only. Transport.—Th.® town could produce 200 donkeys and 200 bullocks. Communications .— (i) The Baghdad-Aleppo caravan route passes through Hit. (ii) To Damascus by desert route (416 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars. (in) To Mosul across the Jazirah (192 miles). Passable for Ford .vans in good weather.20 (iv) To Kubaisah by desert road (13 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars. (v) To Ramadi by right bank road (32 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars. Connected with Ramadi by telegraph and Kubaisah by telephone. Inhabitants.—-The total population of Hit is estimated at &lt; 6,000, all of which, with the exception of 55 Jews, are Muhammadans. Camping Grounds. —Camping ground for a force of any size on the right bank downstream of the town, and there is a landing ground for aeroplanes 11 miles south-west of the town. Administration. —In Turkish days there was a Mudir at Hit under the Qaimmaqam of Ramadi. Under the new Arab Government there is a Mudir under the Mutassarif of Ramadi. Kubaisah.- —The desert town of Kubaisah lies \2\ miles west of Hit. The general appearance of the town is dirty and dilapidated, the houses being little more than mud huts. The chief buildings are the Sarai, Political Khan, Mudir’s Office and the Police Khan, and these are - very small. On the north, east and west sides the town is surrounded by extensive date gardens, which give a pleasant relief to the eye after the dreariness of the surrounding desert. Situated as it is on the edge of the desert and subject to Badawin raids, the town is of necessity built for defence, and although it is not surrounded by a wall the houses on the outer edge of the town appear to be strong and are loopholed. Water. —Kubaisah is dependent for its drinking water on two wells situated a quarter of a mile west-north-west of the town. There is no water inside the town, although rain is collected and in a good year a sufficient supply for 40 days can be obtained in this way. In addition there are three or four other springs and wells outside the town, but these are all very brackish and used for irrigation purposes only. Supplies and Cmnmerce. —The commercial importance of Knbaisah is based on its geographical situation. Standing as it does mi the edge of the desert it forms a convenient trade port for caravans coming from Syria across the desert, a market for Badawin tribes to purchase their supplies, and a jumping off place for caravans proceeding from Iraq across the desert. The chief exports from Kubaisah to Syria are carpets (from Baghdad), horses, sheep, skins, dates, coffee, sugar and grain. With the exceptance of dates these are all \21 satle sable h by ed at i are 'f size ading tHit Arab nadi. miles ated, chief dthe east date ' the a the ivnis nded arto itwo iown. land ledin lings ckish :e of ngas trade esert, ( and cross i are offee, re ah brought from other parts of Iraq to Kubaisah, where they are either purchased by Kubaisah merchants for export or arrangements made for their despatch across the desert. The imports come chiefly from Damascus and Aleppo and consist of the following :— All descriptions of clothing, fruit, silks, dyes, tobacco, and rifles. Kubaisah, like all other desert ports of Iraq, is an important arms traffic centre. Rifles and ammunition are brought in by Badawin convoys from the desert, usually hidden in the packing of more innocent merchandise and sold to receiving agents in the town, who eventually retail them to the Mesopotamian tribes. By this means there is a steady infiltration of arms, supplemented by an occasional caravan carrying nothing but rifles and ammunition, which may bring anything up to 1,000 rifles. Turkish Mauser is the predominating pattern imported, but occasionally French and British rifles are to be found. Although the supply of rifles shows no sign of being exhausted there is a general .indication that ammunition is not so easily obtainable to-day. Of late rifle caravans have been avoiding Kubaisah and taking their wares to towns further south, such as Rahhaliyah and Shifathah, or else selling them direct to the settled tribes of Iraq. Kubaisah itself produces practically nothing except dates, and is entirely dependent on external sources for all supplies. There is a small ill-supplied bazaar of about 20 shops. Grazing. —Nil, except for camels. Transport. —About 200 camels and 120 donkeys could be obtained in the town. Communications.— (i) To Hit by desert road (13 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars. (ii) To Rahhaliyah by desert road (64 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars. (iii) To Ramadi by desert road (48 miles). Passable for Ford vans. (iv) To Anah (64 miles) by desert road. Passable for Ford vans. The routes given below are followed by caravans to Damascus and Aleppo. (a) To Damascus. —Kasr Amaj—Mahaiwah—Tel Agharri— Wadi Suab—al Khor—Bir Saba—Damascus. Alternative Route to Damascus. —Ain al Arnab—Wadi Hauran—Wadi Rathga-—Wadi Suab—Wadi al Miah—Halba— Ali Aniah—Subabiah—Damascus.22 (b) To Aleppo. —Kasr Amaj—Mahaiwah—Tel Agharri— Wadi al Miah—Sukhne—Kona—Aleppo. Kubaisah is connected with Hit by telephone. Inhabitants. —The total population of Kubaisah is estimated at 3,000, all of which are Sunni Muhammadans. The population is divided into six small tribes or houses, for details of which see tribal list under Chapter VI, “ Tribes.” Camping Grounds. —Near the drinking wells a quarter of a mile west-north-west of the town. Only sufficient water for a company. Any force larger than this would cause shortage of water to the inhabitants. Administration. —In Turkish times there was a Mudir under the Qaimmaqam of Ramadi. To-day there is an Arab Mudir. Rahhaliyah. —The desert town of Rahhaliyah lies 49 miles south of Ramadi and 37 miles west-north-west of Karbala. On approaching by the Ramadi road the town gives the impression of being much larger than it really is owing to the scattered nature of the houses, many of which are nothing but ruins and uninhabited. Unlike Kubaisah the town does not appear to have been built with any idea of defence, although most of the houses on the outskirts are loopholed. Rahhaliyah is surrounded by swamps and in consequence is unhealthy and productive of fever. After rain the marshy ground around the town becomes almost impassable. Exten sive palm gardens surround the town, in which there are approximately 20,000 date trees. Water. —Plentiful supply for any number of men and animals from a spring 400 yards north of town. There are four other brackish springs used for irrigation only. Commerce and Supplies .—Supplies obtainable only in very small quantities, as the town is entirely dependent on outside sources ; about 1,500 sheep and goats could be produced. Rahhaliyah is a commercial town in a small way, that is to say, its commercial importance is not nearly so great as that of Kubaisah for instance. The reason for this is that it is not a caravan base, but merely a halting place en route for desert convoys proceeding from Syria down to Shifathah and the Lower Euphrates. Supplies are imported more for the sale to and actual consumption of passing caravans than for despatch to distant destinations. Like all other desert ports, Rahhaliyah is very interested in the traffic of arms, and is a retail station for the sale of rifles and ammunition to the riverain tribes. But here again it is used much more as a halting place for caravans carrying arms than as an actual trading centre.23 Grazing .—Fair grazing fur a cavalry squadron in the winter months, but plentiful for sheep and camels. Transport .—The town could produce about 500 ponies and 1,000 donkeys on demand. Communications .— To Ramadi by road (50 miles). Passable for all arms in good weather. To Kubaisah by desert road (64 miles). To Karbala via Shifathah (60 miles). Passable for Ford vans in good weather. To Najaf by desert road (80 miles). Passable for Ford vans in good weather. Inhabitants .—Approximate population of Rahhaliyah is 2,000, all of whom are Muhammadans. There is a big negroid element. The inhabitants are divided into three families or houses, for details of which see tribal lists under Chapter VI, “ Tribes.” Camping Grounds .—Unlimited in the neighbourhood of drinking spring 400 yards north of the town. Administration .—Mudir under the Mutassarif of Ramadi. Ramadi .—Ramadi is a modern town of about 400 houses on the right bank of the Euphrates, 27 miles upstream of Fallujah and 33 miles downstream of Hit. It stands on slightly elevated ground about 500 yards inland from the river, well surrounded by date palms which exist on the right bank only. About 1|- miles downstream of the town there are extensive date gardens also. Large tracts of land on both banks of the river are under cultivation, irrigated, by water lifts, also on the right bank by the Aziziyah canal. The town gives the impression of cleanliness rarely met with in Mesopotamia, the main streets being broad, in good repair, well swept and lit by electric light. The more important buildings are also above the average for a town of this size, there being a good Sarai, Political House, Police Khan, and several well-appointed residential houses of a good size, including that of Ali Sulaiman, the paramount Shaikh of the Dulaim, which stands m the palm gardens on the right bank upstream of the town. A new bazaar has just been completed which, when all the shops are occupied, should be one of the best in any town of the same size as Ramadi. There is a general air of progress in the town, accompanied by efficient administration and prosperity. (There is a boat bridge across the river miles downstream of the town, for description of which see page 8.)24 About half a mile upstream of Ramadi the Aziziyah canal leaves the right bank of the river and flows in a south-south-east direction into the Habaniyah lake about 5 miles south-east of the town. Cultivation is carried out on both banks of the canal from its head to the lake. Just below the intake the canal is crossed by a stone bridge on the main Ramadi-Hit road. About the same distance downstream of the town lies the incomplete Habaniyah escape. This was under construction by the Turks when war broke out, but was never completed. The Habaniyah lake is a large tract of brackish water of about 100 square miles situated about 5 miles south-east of Ramadi. It is never dry and a little cultivation is to be found on its shores. The water would be drinkable in case of emergency. Water .—Unlimited from the Euphrates. Supplies and Commerce .—There is a well-stocked bazaar with 60 shops from which practically any necessaries can be obtained including a limited amount of tinned food, cigarettes of European manufacture, tobacco, matches and Manchester cotton goods. A small quantity of black oil (a few gallons a day) is obtained from a well called Nafathah on the left bank of the river 10 miles north-east of Ramadi. This is only used for doctoring camels and sheep by the tribesmen, and no attempt has yet been made to find out the productive cajjacity of this well. Ramadi is the market town of the Dulaim of this district, who grow large quantities of wheat, barley, bhoosa, rice, fruit and vegetables. Some of the Badawin also come into the town to purchase supplies. Sheep can be obtained from the semi- nomadic Dulaim elements. Below is an estimate of the amount of supplies available for one year:— Sheep Fruit Fuel ... Rice ... Vegetables ... Barley Hay and Bhoosa 3,000 Tons. 20 221 5 50 300 250 Grazing .-—Depends on the quantity of rain ; in a good year unlimited in the winter months, but owing to rain shortage in the winter of 1920-21 there has been practically no grazing worth speaking of. Transport .—Town could produce 50 camels and 150 donkeys.Communications .— (i) To Baghdad via Fallujah (64 miles). Passable for all arms in good weather. (ii) Track across the Jazirah to Samarrah (60 miles). Passable for Ford vans in good weather. (iii) To Anah via Hit or Kubaisah (112 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars in good weather. (iv) To Rahhaliyah by desert road (50 miles). Passable for L.A.M.B. cars in good weather. Connected with Baghdad and Hit by telegraph. Inhabitants .—The population of Ramadi is 3,000. The inhabitants are all Muhammadan, with the exception of one Christian family. Camping Grounds .—Downstream of the town on the right bank of the river for an infantry division. There is a good aerodrome half a mile south of the town. Administration.—\.n Turkish days Ramadi was the head quarters of a Qaimmaqam. After British occupation it was the headquarters of the Political Officer of the Dulaim division, but to-day under the Arab Government it has a Mutassarif. Raqqa .—The town of Raqqa lies on the left bank of the Euphrates 112-| miles upstream of Dair-al-Zor, the actual site being about one mile inland from the river. The town stands in the south-west corner of a large semi-circular enclosure formed by an old brick wall with round bastions at intervals. The remains of an old mosque stand in the middle of this enclosure. A Circassian colony lies to the west of the Arab village outside the enclosure on high broken ground, and to the east is another ruin-field with a minaret rising from its centre. The town is generally dirty and most insanitary conditions prevail. Water. —Unlimited from the Euphrates. Supplies and Commerce .—The town is surrounded by culti vation, and supplies for a cavalry regiment could be obtained if several days’ notice were given. It is the market town for neighbouring tribes. Grazing. —Depends on the rain, but usually very good. Communications .— (i) To Baghdad via right bank Euphrates (384 miles). Passable for Ford vans. (ii) To Aleppo (128 miles). Passable for Ford vans. (iii) To Meskene via left bank Euphrates (112 miles). Passable for pack transport.26 (iv) To Anah via left bank (192 miles). Passable for pack. (v) To Harran (64 miles). Passable for pack. (vi) To Hama via Rusafet (144 miles). Passable for pack, (vii) By river to Baghdad. Passable for shallow draft vessels. Connected with Aleppo by telegraph. Inhabitants. —The population is approximately 2,000 Muhammadans, composed of Arabs and Circassians. Camping Grounds. —Unlimited on either bank of river. Administration. —Raqqa is the headquarters of a Qadha and seat of Qaimmaqam. CHAPTER ITT. Climate. General Conditions.—between Raqqa and Fallujah the climatic conditions are those of a sub-tropical area which lies at a distance from any ocean ; they are, therefore, of a semi-arid type, although an appreciable amount of rain falls in the winter months. The area lies so to say in the shadow of the high plateau to the north and west, and thus the summer tempera ture is not so unbearable as it is in Lower Mesopotamia. There is, however, considerable variation in the temperature experienced at Raqqa and Fallujah. In the winter the winds are variable, but blow generally from the north-west. In summer there is a continuous current of air from the north-west owing to pressure in the Eastern Mediter ranean being considerably higher than that in the Persian Gulf during these months. This north-west wind descends from the plateau upon the Jazirah as a dry scorching blast from a furnace. It frequently bears a cloud of dust with it. Thus the relativ.e humidity of the atmosphere is extremely low, and even in the wet season rain is not very abundant. Rainfall. —For agricultural purposes the rainfall is quite insufficient and irrigation is an absolute necessity. For grazing purposes the rain produces a desert crop capable of supporting the thousands of camels and sheep of the Badawin Arabs. ^ The first rain may sometimes arrive in October, but usually November is the first month in which heavy rain falls. The rainy season continues until April or early May, after which no further rain occurs until the following October,During these months agriculture can only be carried on by the aid of irrigation. The Balikh and Khabur which never become quite dry maintain a settled population on their banks. During these rainless months the desert grazing becomes scorched and dry, thus being quickly exhausted and keeping the Badawin herdsmen continually on the move, and compelling them to pasture near the river. Snow is rarely known to fall, but in the winter of 1919-20 snow fell for three days at Anah, on the 11th, 12th and 13th February. Winds .-—The general direction of winds throughout the year is from the north-west. During the winter months the direction is rather unsettled, and frequent breezes spring up from the south. Throughout the summer the wind blows practically uninterrupedly from the north-west owing to the centre of high pressure in the Eastern Mediterranean seeking to balance the low pressure in the Persian Gulf. The influence of southern hot winds from the Persian Gulf which usually alternate with the north-west winds throughout the summer, and which are particularly noticeable in August and September, when they ripen the date crop, is felt as far north as Albu Kamal, which is the northern limit of date cultivation. The prevailing wind passes over the plateau of Anatolia and descends on the plains as a dry current of air, rapidly heating up as it descends from the level of the mountains. Calms are of unusual occurrence and it is the rule for the wind to attain its maximum velocity during the day. In the evening the wind diminishes to a gentle breeze, which gradually gathers speed after dawn the following morning. During the summer months sand storms of considerable intensity are frequently met with, and the burning sand, driving along with it a cloud of dust, provides a most unpleasant experience. Visibility may be limited to a few hundred feet for hours together, rendering flying or visual signalling impossible. A further obstacle to visual signalling is provided by the desert mirage which distorts the landscape into unrecognisable shapes. The laying of land lines is easy, and the atmosphere permits of the successful use of wireless telegraphy. Temperature .—The most noteworthy point with regard to the temperature is the wide range. The thermometer varies from below freezing to above 120° in the shade, according to the season of the year. The hottest months are usually August and September, while the greatest degree of cold is experienced in December and January. The temperature varies considerably throughout the area, that28 at Dair-al-Zor being 10° less than that at Ramadi during the summer months. General Medical and Sanitary Conditions. —Little accurate information is available regarding the health conditions amongst the civil population, where the rule of survival of the fittest holds good. As throughout Iraq, eye diseases are very common, infection being carried chiefly by flies and dust, and aggravated by the generally insanitary conditions under which the people live. Epidemics of cholera, typhus and smallpox appear at intervals, and cases of bubonic plague have been known to occur. Casualties from Sickness amongst Troops. —The health of our troops stationed on the Euphrates has generally speaking, been excellent. A brief resume of operations on the Upper Euphrates from a health standpoint is instructive. Ramadi Operations, July, 1917.—In July, 1917, an unsuc cessful attempt was made to capture Ramadi. _ Troops concentrated at Sinn adh Dhibban, marching by night, and the advance took place on the night of 10th-11th July, when the column moved on Ramadi by a night march of 18 miles. I he troops were in good physical condition at the beginning of operations, and suffered no casualties from either heat stroke or heat exhaustion on the march up. Contrary to expectations, however, the Turks put up a resistance, and our troops being held up in the open began to suffer somewhat severely from heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Ihe initiation of operations unfortunately coincided with a heat wave producing temperatures of over 120°, and with a very hot wind blowing from the east. Between the 11th and 15th July 165 wounded passed through the field ambulances, whilst during the same period there were 291 cases of sickness, nearly all heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Of these cases there were 10 deaths from heat stroke. Ihe medical personnel in the field ambulances suffered as severely as the troops from the excessive heat, thereby greatly increasing the difficulty in attending to the casualties and sickness amongst the fighting troops and followers. Fall of Ramadi. —The operations ending in the fall of Ramadi took place on the 28th and 29th September, 1917. 1 roops were fit when operations began and they were brought to such a swift and successful conclusion that casualties from sickness were practically nil.The captured Turkish forces in Ramadi had about 100 sick in hospital, and they were chiefly suffering from malaria, eye trouble, dysentery and debility. During the operations culminating in the surrender of the Turkish Army at Khan Baghdadi, and in the temporary occupation of Hadithah and Anah between 26th March and 3rd April, 1918, the health of our troops was particularly good. During the period mentioned 391 sick Turkish prisoners passed through our field ambulances. The chief diseases amongst the prisoners were aneemia, debility, diarrhoea, emaciation, incipient tuberculosis, and slight scurvy. Considering that over 5,250 prisoners were captured the percentage of sickness was very small. In the operations on the Upper Euphrates between January and June, 1920, the most prevalent diseases amongst our troops were :— (a) Digestive diseases averaging 6-1 admissions to hospital per 1,000 men per month. (b) Malaria, averaging 4-2 admissions to hospital per 1,000 men per month. There was no prevalence of bilharzia and venereal disease among the troops, although among the inhabitants 30 per cent, were found to be affected with the former and 65 per cent, with the latter. The following table shows the average monthly rate of admissions to hospital per 1,000 men on the Upper Euphrates between January and June, 1920, compared with that of all the British forces in Iraq :— Upper Euphrates. Whole Force. British. Indian. Total. British. Indian. Total. 64-6 27-0 28-6 91-5 32-3 36-4 Conditions affecting Aviation .—In the plain region under consideration the ground in summer is heated to a very high temperature, and the air in contact with it is consequently much hotter than at a short distance from it. The density of the layer of air in contact with the ground is therefore less than that of the upper layers, and all objects seen through these heated layers appear to be below their true position.30 For a line of sight from any considerable height this form of interference would not be serious, but when the ground is highly heated, the ascending hot air and the cooler air which descends to take its place will probably produce a general haziness through the hottest time of the day. Visibility is generally good. Clouds are rare in summer and the few that do occur are cirrus clouds at high altitudes. Ground mists, especially near the river, are encountered particularly in the winter months. In winter clouds hang very low, at 200 feet sometimes, and on such occasions it is only possible to see ahead for three to five miles, a source of difficulty when travelling at 70 miles an hour. The prevailing wind in summer blows from the north, and is seldom strong enough to prevent flying. Storms usually during April and May are, however, not infrequent, and they are of sufficient violence to blow over machines which may be unsheltered on the aerodrome. CHAPTER IV. Resources. General. The Upper Euphrates area is essentially an agricultural country, and possesses no manufacturing industries on a large scale. The only other activities worthy of mention are the production of bitumen and lime at Hit. The chief exports consist of agricultural produce despatched to other parts of Iraq or across the desert to Syria, but during the war the demands of both the British and Turkish forces reduced the export trade to a minimum, and the existence of a theatre of war in this area caused a serious handicap to cultivation from which the tribes have only just recovered. To-day, however, there is a general atmosphere of progress in the area under administration. Labour. The possibility of raising labour corps for military purposes in this area is surrounded by the usual difficulties experienced in other parts of the country. Although there is no shortage of labour as far as the actual population is con cerned, the tribesman is disinclined to adopt any other form of work than that of cultivator or shepherd, which he finds sufficient for his support, with the minimum expenditure of energy. Despite the fact that for several months of the year those employed on cultivated land have little or nothingto do, they are averse to taking up any other form of employ ment during this period, as they find they have sufficient for their needs, and look on it as a natural period of rest. In 1919 there were about 4,000 Dulaim coolies working in Baghdad, but they were attracted chiefly by the high rate of pay, coupled with the exceptional opportunities of indulging their natural thieving proclivities. Agriculture. — (a) Products. —(i) Wheat, barley, lentils, rice, maize, simsim, mash, dukhn and a little cotton. (ii) Brinjals, cucumbers, melons, onions, radishes and beans. (iii) Dates, apples, pears, mulberries and pomegranates. (6) Methods .—The existing methods of cultivating on the Upper Euphrates are primitive, and in this respect the Arab is very conservative, in that he regards with suspicion any outside suggestion of new and more progressive measures. Of late, however, one or two of the more important sheikhs have displayed a certain interest in agricultural machinery, which has resulted in the arrival at Ramadi of six motor- driven ploughing machines, and there is little doubt that this will lead to further development if evidence in the shape of greater production in less time can be shown. The presence of British expert agriculture and irrigation officers was at first regarded with suspicion, and the tribesmen were inclined to be sceptical. The good results produced thereby, however, convinced them that they were materially the gainers, and that their appointments were not an excuse to find a well-paid sinecure for British officers. The rainfall is not nearly sufficient for the crops in this area, and irrigation is therefore a very prominent factor. Where canals do not exist the cultivation is confined to the river banks, stretching inland only as far as water can be carried from the water lifts in small channels. The canals have enabled large tracts of country well inland from the river to be put under cultivation, and, where new canals have been constructed, every available inch of land has been farmed. The months of August and September are devoted to sowing and the harvest is gathered in April and May. Experiments have been carried out on the Saqlawiyah canal in the growth of cotton under Government supervision, and so far the results have been satisfactory. The sheikhs have displayed great interest in the experiment, and are keen to attempt further development. Minerals .—The mineral resources of the Upper Euphrates are centred around the bitumen wells at Hit. Apart from this the32 area possesses no mineral wealth, with the exception of a negligible quantity of oil from Nafathah (10 miles north-east of Ramadi), which, however, might be capable of exploitation if the enterprise were forthcoming. Bitumen .—The bitumen wells at Hit (seven in number) are said to have been worked for at least 5,000 years, and it is believed that their capacity is unlimited. The output depends entirely on the extent the townsmen are desirous of working the wells, but averages between 150 and 300 tons per month, most of which is exported up or downstream in shakturs and sold at Hit with their cargoes. Locally bitumen is used for boat building, the making of bricks, caulking of baskets and as fuel for kilns. The method of production is as primitive to-day as it was 5,000 years ago, the bitumen being extracted from the wells by hand. The only sign of modern progression is the light railway which runs between the wells and the river bank, the rolling stock consisting of a hand-propelled trolley. Lime .—Lime is manufactured at Hit by burning bitumen with limestone from the neighbouring quarries, the average output being 300 tons per month, all of which is exported downstream. The best quarry is at Jaladiyah, 5 miles north west of Hit. Salt .—The only controlled salt pans exist at Hit ; 300 tons per year are exported. Oil .—There is a small oil spring at Nafathah on the left bank of the Euphrates 10 miles north-east of Ramadi. Only a few gallons per day are produced, and the oil is used solely for doctoring sheep and camels. It is not known to what extent oil exists here or whether exploitation would pay. Manufactures .—The only manufacturing enterprise of any importance on the Upper Euphrates is at Hit, where kufahs or country boats are constructed. These are made by inter lacing branches of tamarisk and mulberry trees with basket work or reeds and straw, and the whole is eventually caulked w ith a mixture of bitumen and sand. They usually draw about 22 inches when laden and about 6 inches when empty. When despatched downstream for sale they are loaded with lime and bitumen and sold with their cargoes. Commerce .—The tribesman takes his agricultural produce and flocks to the market town for sale, where they are bought up either by the town merchants for export or by Badawin tribes who have come in from the desert for supplies. The chief purchases made by the local tribesmen are manufactured articles of various kinds, chiefly Manchester cotton goods,hardware, saddlery, glass, and, if obtainable, rifles. Each town provides the market for the surrounding districts and the local Arab does not look further afield for his necessary purchases, unless, perchance, he sees the opportunity of purchasing a rifle or ammunition, for which he is prepared to take considerable trouble or travel almost any distance. Grain is exported from the riverain towns to Syria, the desert tribes, and Baghdad. Camel caravans from Damascus and Aleppo visit the desert ports and riverain towns periodically throughout the whole year. From Syria they carry all descriptions of clothing, fruit, silks, dyes, tobacco, and occasionally rifles and ammunition. On the return journey across the desert they carry skins, dates, coffee, sugar, carpets and grain. Customs .—The present customs tariff in the Dulaim Division is as detailed below :— (a) Imports .—-15 per cent, ad valorem with special rates for spirits, certain foodstuffs and agricultural machinery. The total value of imports for the year 1920 was Rupees 28,470. (b) Exports .—1 per cent, ad valorem with special rates for horses, dates, oil and tobacco. Figures are not available, as no charge is made on exports to Syria, which is practically the only country to which goods are sent from this area. Revemie .—Taxes in the Dulaim Division are collected by the Revenue authorities direct from the sheikhs, who in turn collect from the fallahin through the sirkals. This system is satisfactory and much more acceptable to the tribesmen than the pernicious method of “ farming ” taxes which was adopted by the Turks.

General .—The great majority of the inhabitants of the area under report are Arabs of the Sunni sect. Christians, Jews, and Shiah Muhammadans are so few in number that they need scarcely be considered as a factor of any importance. Census .—Accurate census figures are not available, and owing to the migratory habits of large sections of the population they are impossible to obtain. An approximate estimate of the population derived from various sources is given below :— Arabs (Sunni Muhammadans) ... ... 331,000 Arabs (Shiah Muhammadans ... 200 J ews 3,600 Christians 1,200 Total ... 336,000 The Upper Euphrates is the home of four types of Arab, all of which are more or less distinct from the other, possessing their own characteristics.36 These four types are :— (1) The Baclawin, or purely nomadic wanderers in the desert, being represented in this area by the large and powerful Anizah confederation. (2) The semi-nomad, who pastures his flocks in the desert, whilst at the same time he owns and cultivates land in the vicinity of the river. The Dulaim are a good illustration of this type, approximately 50 per cent, of the tribe being semi-nomadic and the remainder settled cultivators. (3) The settled cultivator, residing permanently either on the river bank or in an irrigated area, and engaged in purely agricultural pursuits. No tribe on the Upper Euphrates is composed entirely of settled cultivators, and the percentage in each tribe varies, as, for instance, in the Dulaim approximately 50 per cent, of the tribe are settled cultivators, while in the Baqqarah they amount to 75 per cent. (4) The town-dweller, engaged in commercial or industrial pursuits, living on the proceeds of land or houses which he owns, a Government official, or a member of the professional classes. The only Badawin tribe which is connected with the area under report is the Anizah. To-day the Anizah tribesman will state that he is a descendant of Wa’il, who belonged to a younger branch of the Asad group, and further claims that his son ’Anaz was the founder of the tribe. The original home of the Anizah is believed to have been just north of Madinah on the watershed between the Red Sea and the basin of the Wadi al Rummah. In the latter half of the eighteenth century the Anizah started to move north wards. The Fad’an and the Hasanah pushed the Shammar before them across the Euphrates and established themselves on the northern steppes. The Amarat, Wulud Ali and Saba appear to have been the next to move, and later came the Ruwallah. The Dulaim, the largest semi-nomadic tribe in this area, claim to have come to Iraq from springs in Central Arabia known as Dulaimiyat, under the leadership of one Thamir, but this is open to doubt. It is extremely difficult to obtain anything really reliable regarding the origin of any tribe, as their traditions have become so distorted through additions and exaggeration that one has to accept with reserve any information on this point emanating from a local source. Language .—The only language spoken and understood by the whole population of the Upper Euphrates is Arabic, although a few individuals will be found in the various towns who can speak Turkish.37 inthe %eand desert, stes land re a good Per cent, emainder either on ‘gaged in ie Upper tivators, nstance, the tribe ah they dustrial houses • nber of he area besman ?ed to a that his tve been Red Sea tter half r e north- lhammar emselves md Saba jame the his aieai il Arabia Thamir, to obtain tribe, as additions ierve any me. stood by s Arabic, ous toms CHAPTER VI. Tribes. General .—The tribes of the Upper Euphrates consist chiefly of large semi-nomadic confederations which own cultivation on the river banks and canals. The sheep and camel-breeding portions of these tribes provide the nomad element which moves either into the Jazirah or the Syrian desert for winter grazing. In addition, there are also purely nomadic tribes which come in the area under report, such as sections of the Anizah, which, although normally to be found in the desert, occasionally visit the market towns and sometimes camp on the river banks. Unlike other areas of Iraq, the Upper Euphrates is con spicuous by the absence of small independent tribes, the reason being that all such have gradually become embodied in one or other of the larger confederations, chiefly for the purpose of defence. This can easily be understood, as owing to the proxi mity to the desert, the habitat of any settled tribe on the river is extremely susceptible to raids from the Badawin, and unless the tribe is strong enough for self-protection, it must of a necessity either form an alliance with or become part of one of the main confederations. Apart from the menace to small tribes from the desert, the riverain tribes are expert robbers, and raids and counter-raids among themselves are of frequent occurrence. Internal cohesion in the different tribes varies considerably, but, with the exception of the Dulaim, it is not particularly strong in any tribe. It is quite conceivable in the event of trouble for one or more sections of a tribe to side with the Government, while the remainder would be actively hostile, and this was amply borne out in the disturbances in the spring of 1920. Armed Forces .—An accurate estimate of the total population in the absence of census figures for this area is impossible, but the following figures will serve as an approximate estimate of the fighting strength of the whole area. These figures are for the riverain tribes only, and do not include Badawin — Men capable of bearing arms ... ... 40,000 Modern rifles ... ... ... ... 10,000 Old but serviceable rifles ... ... 12,500 The tribesmen of the Upper Euphrates are well armed, and it has never been a matter of great difficulty for them to secure (C4206) c 338 rifles and ammunition owing to their geographical situation, which brings them into close touch with Badawin tribes and desert towns engaged in the arms traffic. In addition to this, the Turks distributed arms broadcast on their retirement upstream. Syria also has always proved a fruitful source of supply, and rifles carried by the Badawin from Aleppo and Damascus find a ready market in the desert ports of Iraq. Tribes in relation to possible Areas of Disturbance .—The possibility of disturbances on the Upper Euphrates can be treated under two headings :— (1) External tribal aggression. (2) Internal tribal risings. (1) The present frontier line which crosses the Euphrates midway between Albu Kamal and A1 Qaim excludes practically all the Upper Euphrates tribes from our area of administration except the Dulaim. It may be generally assumed that all the tribes upstream of Al Qaim have very little feeling of friendship towards the British, and they lost no opportunity of displaying this on our withdrawal to the present boundary. As far as the tribes themselves are concerned, they have little or nothing to gain by aggressive action against us, and as long as the existing friendly relations are maintained with the Dulaim, who would actively oppose any advance from up stream, there is little to fear from external tribal aggression unless substantially supported by regular troops. It must be remembered, however, that the tribes upstream of Al Qaim are under the control of the Syrian Government, and, if given sufficient support by regular troops, would not be averse to trying conclusions with the Dulaim in the hope of securing loot. It is, however, difficult to conceive a large tribal army raised by the Damascus Government operating in conjunction with troops against our frontier. In the first place these tribes have very little tribal feeling and discipline, and are split by feuds which would make it practically impossible for them to operate together for any length of time without internal friction and disputes. Secondly, they could not leave their flocks and cultivation denuded of any form of protection to the tender mercies of the Badawin, who would be quick to seize such a golden opportunity raiding on a large scale ; and thirdly, the question of rationing a large tribal force in the field presents a difficulty almost insurmountable.(C4206) c 4 The tribe immediately bordering on our frontier is the Aqaidat, the total strength of which is estimated at approxi mately 4,000 rifles. For the reasons given above nothing approaching this figure could be maintained in the field for a protracted period, and the tribal force would probably take the form of two or three bands from 300 to 500 strong, which would carry on a guerilla warfare animated by anticipation of loot. (2) As regards the possibility of internal disturbances there is one predominant factor which has a direct bearing upon the situation within the sphere of the Iraq administration, and that is that the Dulaim influence extends from Khan Nuqtah to A1 Qaim, i.e., throughout the whole area. At present the Dulaim have a fairly strong tribal organisation and spirit which is a great asset in that it has brought the tribe as a whole under the control of Shaikh Ali Sulaiman, who has maintained a consistently pro-British attitude. This had the effect of keeping the Dulaim in hand in 1920, when all the adjoining tribes were in insurrection. The most turbulent elements of the Dulaim are located between Anah and Hit, and these are the sections most likely to defy the authority of Ali Sulaiman in the event of trouble. The Albu Nimr and Albu Mahal could put, approximately, 1,000 rifles in the field, but this number could not be main tained for any length of time beyond a few days. They would probably be joined by a number of bad characters from Rawah (on the left bank opposite Anah), a town with a very unenviable reputation. With the hope of obtaining loot, their most likely first objective would be Anah. Between Hit and Fallujah the sections are well under control, and nothing more disturbing than inter-sectional fighting is likely to occur. East and downstream of Fallujah the Dulaim join up with the Zoba’. Since the 1920 insurrection many Zoba’ sections have become absorbed into the Dulaim confederation, acknow ledging the paramount chief. There is little probability of these sections becoming involved in any serious trouble which could not be dealt with by tribal action under their paramount shaikh. The remaining Zoba’ sections which have set up as indepen dent tribes might conceivably form themselves into one group for hostile action against the Government, although at present there is no reason why they should take such a step ; in fact, as they realise themselves, they would have everything to lose by doing so and little or nothing to gain. In such a contingency they could muster some 1,200 rifles between them, but here again it would be quite impossible for them to40 maintain more than one quarter of that number in the field. They would most probably direct their attentions to harassing communication between Baghdad and Fallujah, as they did during the 1920 insurrection. Political Attitude .—The political attitude of the Upper Euphrates must be considered from three standpoints, i.e. :—- (a) External as regards Syria. {b) External as regards Turkey. (c) Internal. {a) The admitted ambition of the Damascus Government is to establish the frontier between Syria and Iraq on the Wadi Hauran. To this ambition were due the disturbances on the Upper Euphrates early in 1920, which began with the unauthorised occupation of Dair-al-Zor by Ramadhanal Shallash and terminated in the subsequent British withdrawal to A1 Qaim after a conference with fully accredited repre sentatives of the Syrian Government. The primary object of the Syrian Arab Government was to make our position in the newly occupied area so uncomfortable, and to harass our lines of communication to such an extent, that we would be compelled to evacuate practically the whole of the Upper Euphrates. With this end in view they disseminated extensive pan-Arab propaganda amongst the tribes in our area of occupation, which eventually bore fruit in the shape of definite hostility towards the British on the part of Aqaidat sections, the Jaghaifah and one or two Dulaim sections in the vicinity of Anah. Although they failed to attain their ambition to the full {i.e., establishment of boundary on the Wadi Hauran) the Damascus Government succeeded in forcing withdrawal to A1 Qaim, and there is little doubt that to-day the desire to extend their territory downstream still exists. The re-occupation of Damascus and establishment of control over the Arab Government by the French, however, is likely to have a restraining influence in this direction, although they have shown remarkably little power to minimise the activity of tribes adjoining our sphere of influence, which once having become steeped in anti-British propaganda, display little desire to resume friendly relations. The friendship and alliance with Fahad Beg ibn Hadhdhal, chief of the Amarat section of the Anizah, has proved a very valuable weapon in our hands in dealing with trans-frontier tribal politics. As long as we can rely upon Fahad Beg to take action, the danger of any purely tribal aggression is reduced to a minimum.(b) Since the armistice the Turks have lost no opportunity of spreading propaganda amongst the tribes of Iraq, and in this respect the Euphrates has not escaped attention. The intrigues of Turkish agents who use pan-Islamic and anti- British propaganda as their chief instruments, have made themselves felt both in the Jazirah and amongst the riverain tribes, but their efforts have been crowned with little success. The tribes of the Khabur river and the Shammar Jarba are the chief objects of Turkish attention, and, although this might react unfavourably on the Euphrates, it more directly affects the Mosul Vilayat and the Upper Tigris Line. Unless the Turks could show something tangible in the form of regular troops to back up any tribal activity directed against us, they are not likely to cause any very serious embarrassment by purely propaganda methods only. (c) A year or two ago the tribal organisation of the Dulaim, like that of many other tribes of Iraq, began to show signs of breaking up, but fortunately for us this was arrested by Shaikh Ali Sulaiman, who has now managed to establish a good tribal spirit and a strong control over the tribe. The political importance of this cannot be over-estimated, as, with the exception of a few independent Zoba’ sections, the whole of the riverain territory of the Upper Euphrates within our area is occupied by Dulaim. The attitude of Ali Sulaiman, the paramount Shaikh of the Dulaim, has been consistently pro-British, and he has always shown himself ready to render active assistance to us when called upon to do so. Naturally this attitude is not the outcome of pure disinterested friendship, and no one realises more than Ali Sulaiman to what extent his wealth and prosperity depend upon his good relations with the Government. In this he is followed by other important Dulaim chiefs such as Shaukah ibn Mutlaq, Mushbin ibn Hardan and latterly, Aftan al Sharqi. So long as Ali Sulaiman maintains his present strong position in the Dulaim, and his friendly attitude towards the Govern ment, there is no reason why the present satisfactory political situation in the Dulaim division should not continue. Military Considerations .—The operations carried out against tribes of the Upper Euphrates early in 1920 differed from those carried out on the Middle Euphrates later in the year in one respect, i.e., the tribal concentrations encountered on the Upper Euphrates were much smaller, and they adopted a more guerilla form of warfare. They showed a distinct disinclination to come to anything like close quarters with our troops unless their numerical superiority gave them at least a reasonable chance of escaping without punishment. They are adepts45 Minor tribe, section or sub-section Main tribe or confederation Minor tribe, section or sub-section Main tribe or confederation Taha albu. Taiyib albu. Ta’mah albu. Dulaim. Dulaim.

The great group of the Anizah, numerically probably the largest group in the nomad Arab tribes, occupies the triangle of the Syrian Desert or Hamad which has its base on latitude 30° i. with Jauf about as its centre, and its apex at Aleppo. On the left bank of the Euphrates the pastures north of Dair-al-Zor J . vatl ' and along the Khabur are also visited by the Anizah. A smaller group of kindred tribes is seated round Teima between the Hejaz Railway and the south-west borders of the Nefud. These will not be further discussed here. The Anizah belong to the people of the north, Ahl-Ash- i, Shimal. The modern Anizah tribesman will always claim descent from Wa’il, who belonged to a younger branch of the i. Asad group, and relate that it is his son ’Anaz who is the founder of the tribe. The tribe is not united under one head, but divided into several large sections which maintain an attitude ™ s ' generally friendly, but which does not exclude raids and feuds between the sections. Their original home is believed to have been a little north of Madinah on the watershed between the Red Sea and the t. basin of %.) Wadi-ar-Rummah. In the second half of the eighteenth century one of those mysterious impulses which, from the beginning of historic times, have set the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula moving northwards—influences which may spring from an almost imperceptible change in climatic conditions coupled with the gradual increase of population in a land incapable of supporting more than very small numbers—began to disturb the Anizah and portions of the Shammar.46 The former followed on the heels of the latter into Hamad. The Fad’an and the Hasanah pushed the Shammar before them across the Euphrates and established themselves on the northern steppes, which are less arid than the wastes of Central Arabia. The Amarat, Wulud Ali and Saba’ seem to have come next, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the Ruwallah. Their herds have flourished in a climate more beneficent than that which they left. The most famous stocks of horses and the greatest number of camels are found amongst the Northern Anizah. Their camel herds are estimated at 600,000 head in all, and supply the markets of Egypt, Syria and Meso potamia. Badawin of the purest blood and tradition, the Anizah remained entirely beyond the control of the Turkish Government, and except for a few palm gardens on the Lower Euphrates and a village near Damascus, their Shaikhs have given no pledge to civilisation and established order by the acquisition of settled land, nor is any part of the Hamad ploughed and harvested. Their geographical position gives them the command of the main trade route between Syria and Mesopotamia, and at the same time compels them to keep on good terms with those who control their commercial markets, f.e., the larger towns on both edges of the Syrian desert. The Anizah are hereditary foes of the Shammar, and the history of northern nomad Arabia for the last 150 years has been dominated by the feuds of these two tribal confederations. Amarat. (Fahad Beg Ibn Hadhdhal.) The Amarat range the eastern portion of the Hamad from west of Najaf to Dair-al-Zor. In early spring they are usually in the wide depression known as ’A1 Ga’rah round Bir Mulussa, 80 miles south-west of Albu Kama!. In summer they go to the Euphrates between Ramadi and Dair-al-Zor. In autumn they usually camp on the edge of the desert west of Karbala in the vicinity of Shifathah and Rahhaliyah. They number some 4,500 tents and 5,000 rifles. Fahad Beg entered into alliance with the Britislf after the fall of Baghdad in 1917, and has been consistently friendly ever since. He owns an estate at Razarah, 15 miles north west of Karbala. He is now a very old man, but still has a great reputation in the desert. He cordially dislikes the Turks. His son Mahrut manages the active affairs of the tribe. The Amarat are friendly with the Dulaim and bitter enemies of the Shammar Jarba of the Jazirah and of the SouthernShammar. They were on bad terms with the Ruwallah, but Fahad Beg and Nuri as Sha’lan have now come to an under standing. Their relations with the Saba’ and Fad’an are not cordial. It is extremely unlikely that Amarat will depart from their friendly relations with us, depending as they do almost entirely for their supplies on the markets of Najaf, Karbala, Shifathah, Rahhaliyah and Baghdad. Fahad Beg has received a monthly subsidy of Rs. 17,000 from us since the fall of Baghdad. Ruwallah. (Nuri as Sha’lan.) The chief importance of the Ruwallah from our point of view is the fact that they command the Hit-Damascus road, one of the main trade routes between Syria and Mesopotamia. With their powerful confederates, the Wulud Ali, the Muhal- laf and the Hasanah, who are usually in the closest relations with them, they number 7,000 tents. The Ruwallah alone number 5,000 rifles. They wander over the desert from Hama and Homs in the North, where the Hasanah have their summer pasturages and are beginning to settle down as cultivators, to Qasr-al-Azraq, south of the Jabal Druz and down the Wadi Sirhan to Jauf. They extend to the east as far as the sources of the Wadi Hauran. In summer they draw into the Wadi Sirhan. The paramount chief of the Ruwallah is Nuri as Sha’lan, whose authority is also recognised by the Wulud ’Ali and the Muhallaf. He is one of the most powerful of all Badawin chiefs. He is bitterly hostile to the Turks and has allied himself with the Sharif. He is not too friendly towards the British, and dreads any extension of civilised authority into the desert. After his capture of Jauf from the Shammar of Ibn Rashid in 1912 he was the most successful rival of the Southern Shammar, but Ibn Rashid succeeded in recapturing Jauf in 1920. The Ruwallah were at one time on bad terms with the Amarat, but Nuri as Sha’lan and Fahad Beg came to a friendly agreement in the spring of 1921.54 Aqaidat. 1. The Aqaidat are a loose tribal confederation stretching roughly from the vicinity of Tibni to about 5 miles down stream of Albu Kamal on both banks of the Euphrates. Aqaidat means “ The Confederates ” in Arabic. They are Sunnis by religion, and claim Zubaid descent, but any reliable information about them is exceedingly hard to obtain as they seem to have an inborn suspicion of Govern ment, doubtless due to their dealings with the Turks. 2. The tribe is now semi-nomadic. They cultivate their holdings along the Euphrates, whilst part of them pasture flocks of sheep in the desert. 3. They do not roam over large tracts of country, as do the recognised Badawin tribes, but they pasture their flocks in the desert on both the right and left banks of the river more or less in the neighbourhood of their riverain holdings. The flocks are normally taken out to graze about November as soon as sufficient rain has fallen to make the grass grow in the desert; and they return to the river about the middle or end of April, according to the season. 4. The location of the various sections of this tribe are shown on the map attached to this report. 5. To understand the present fighting qualities of the tribe it is necessary to trace their history for a number of years. They were apparently brought over from Syria by the Anizah about the end of the 17th century, and they were put in as cultivators along the stretch of country they now occupy. The Anizah protected them as far as possible from raids from other Badawin tribes in return for an annual tribute paid in kind. At this time they were purely fallahin or cultivators and they were confined to the banks of the river. They had at this time a fairly strong tribal organisation, as it was essential for their existence that they should be able to combine to resist aggres sion from the various raiding parties of Badawin who infested the country, as it was impossible for the Anizah to protect them from every raid. After the Crimean War, when the Turkish Government was in a position to assert their authority and the Middle Euphrates was brought under some sort of control, the Turks began by every means in their power to break tribal strength and organisation, particularly amongst the Aqaidat. Inter-tribal dissensions and blood feuds appear to have been deliberately and steadily encouraged, but the finishing touches were given by the granting of “ Tapu Sanads ” or title deeds to individual cultivators.55 e ®t, but hard to Govern. ate their pasture as do the bin the more or ?s.

The effect of the grant of title deeds to individuals was to break the power and influence of the Shaikhs and to make every tribesman his own master, dealing direct with Government. The Shaikhs have little or no influence over the main body of their tribes, and eveiy village, or rather group of huts, has a headman known as a “ Mukhtar.” These “ Mukhtars ” are chosen by election, and if not personally acceptable to their followers they are liable to be replaced. Of comparatively recent years portions of the Aqaidat have begun to own sheep, camels and horses, and they graze their flocks in the neighbourhood of then riverain holdings. They have therefore become semi- nomadic in addition to holding their original lands along the river. This is curious as being a reversal of the usual oidci of things. „ , . , , x The whole tribe owns about 4,000 rifles, of which about l,o 00 are modern, mostly German Mausers, and the remainder are of older pattern but serviceable. They are plentifully supplied with ammunition, of which there has been a very large supp y since the Turkish defeat in Palestine and Syria. It is impossible to give any accurate estimate of the amount of ammunition at their disposal, but it is unlikely to be exhausted for some years to come. . . . The Aqaidat are raided indiscriminately by the Amzali, Shammar and Dulaim, who look down upon and despise them. The reason for this is that the Aqaidat combine pastoral and agricultural pursuits with the robbery of passing caravans. They will not, however, attack a caravan unless in overwhelming numbers, and these raids are generally accompanied by murder in addition to robbery. It appears, however, that, although affecting to despise the Aqaidat, the other tribes in their vicinity hesitate to fight the riverain section?, and only raid their flocks in the desert. The riverain villages are situated in difficult country for military operations unless in some strength. Dense brushwood, small sandhills and nullahs give good cover to the villagers, who cross the river in shakturs or on inflated skins if attacked in any foice. a n tactics are to attack convoys or numerically inferior forces for which they lie in wait in difficult country. 6 The present political attitude of the tribe is anti-British and nominally pro-Sharifian, although they would probably prefer no settled Government at all, but would wish to revert to the lawless methods of a century ago, taking toll on all56 passing travellers and caravans as well as shaktur loads of merchandise proceeding down river. 7. After the Sharifian occupation of Dair-al-Zor in December, 1919, certain sections of the Aqaidat were affected by the propaganda of Ramadhan al Shallash, who is himself a member of the tribe. Their fanaticism and cupidity were specially appealed to with the object of persuading them to raid our lines of communication, so that owing to supply difficulties we would be forced to evacuate Albu Kamal. This propaganda was fruitful in that it had the effect of inciting numerous sections of the Aqaidat to hostile activity against us. The following sections were definitely implicated in raids on transport convoys and attacks on isolated garrisons during the disturbances on the Upper Euphrates in the spring and early summer of 1920 :— Hassun, Shaitat, Dimim, Albu Qa’an, Albu Miri’, Hardan and Mushahidah. When they came into contact with our troops they occasionally displayed considerable bravery and fighting ability. 1 hey, however, chiefly confined their efforts to attacks on marching convoys on our lines of communication and whenever possible avoided any chance of meeting troops in any strength. After punitive measures both by columns and from the air had been taken against the Aqaidat, Shaikhs of all the above sections, with the exception of the Shaitat, came into Albu Kamal on 21st March, 1921, and accepted our terms. Fines were imposed on these sections, which were paid up in full by 5th April of that year. The Shaitat have never made sub mission, as after the new frontier line had been fixed the Aqaidat were no longer in our area of occupation. , S worth y °f note that throughout the disturbances Shaikh Turki Beg ibn Nijris, chief of the Thulth section of the Aqaidat, maintained a consistently friendly attitude towards us, and made every endeavour to bring the hostile sections to terms with the Government. 8 . For reasons already explained the extent of internal cohesion in the Aqaidat is relatively poor ; the sections and even the villages act on their own, and any other members of t io tribe within reach will join in if the opportunity for obtaining loot is favourable. Any concerted action amongst all the sections of the tribe is unlikely, and practically impossible. previously explained the Shaitat are despised by all the Badawin tribes in their vicinity. They are at enmity with the bhammar, Dulaim and Anizah, but they appear able to take care of themselves.10. In addition to ordinary military measures such as attacking their villages by land and air, there are two ways of bringing this tribe to heel quickly : the first is the removal or destruction of all Karud (water lift) animals in their villages, and the second is the raiding of their camps in the desert, more especially with armoured cars. Stock found should be destroyed if it cannot be removed. It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that these people are of an exceedingly low type, and punitive measures other than the strongest will have no effect upon them. The removal of their Karud animals will destroy their crops, which are all irrigated by lift and not by flow ; and this, combined with the raiding of their flocks, should have the effect of subduing them in the shortest possible time.(C4206) i&gt; 65 Baqqarah. The Baqqarah is a large loose confederation of sections which have become almost independent tribes, have little or no internal cohesion, and are split by inter-sectional feuds. The portion of the tribe dealt with in this report is that settled on the left bank of the Euphrates between Raqqa and Busairah. This, however, only forms approximately one-half of the Baqqarah, the remainder being on the Khabur river and in the Jazirah as far north as the Jabal Abdul-Aziz. The majority of the Baqqarah on the Euphrates are culti vators and produce wheat, barley and maize in considerable quantities. Most of their crops are sent to upstream markets including Dair-al-Zor. About 25 per cent, of the tribe are sheep breeders and move into the Jazirah for winter grazing between the months of September and April. This tribe does not now come into our area of occupation but is under the Syrian Government. The general tone of the Baqqarah has up to the present been anti-British, and in December, 1919, when Ramadhan al Shallash entered Dair- al-Zor, they were represented in his following.63 Dulaim. The Dulaim state that they came to Iraq, under the leader ship of one Thamir, from springs in Central Arabia named Dulaimiyat. They are Sunnis of the Shaft sect. Numbering approximately 26,000 men, they possess cultivation on both banks of the Euphrates from Imam Hamzah to A1 Qaim. About 50 per cent, of the tribe are settled cultivators, the remainder being nomadic sheep and camel breeders who move into the Eastern Shamiyah and the Jazirah between the Euphrates and Tigris for their winter grazing. The nomadic sections usually leave their summer habitat on the Euphrates about September and return in April. No definite area or routes can be laid down for the migration of the nomad element as their movements are entirely governed by the quantity of grazing available in the various areas. If the grazing in the Shamiyah in one particular year happens to be better than that in the J azirah, then many sections who would normally migrate to the Jazirah would be found in the Shamiyah. The Dulaim share the pastures of the Amarat (with whom they are on friendly terms) in the Eastern Shamiyah. In the Jazirah the nomad portion sometimes moves as far north as Tikrit on the right bank of the Tigris. The Dulaim are at feud with the Shammar Jarba and raids on the flocks from both sides are of frequent occurrence, although of late Shaikh Ali Sulaiman has made endeavours to improve the relations between the Dulaim and Shammar. Practically no section of the Dulaim is purely nomadic, but each section has its portion of nomad sheep breeders (in most cases about 50 per cent, of the total strength of the section). The Dulaim are famous as sheep breeders and before the war used to supply large quantities for the Damascus markets. During the war this trade in sheep suffered con siderably and their flocks were much depleted by the demands of the Turkish forces. They are, however, now steadily increasing their flocks and regaining the position they held in the sheep trade. The agricultural portions of the Dulaim cultivate on both banks of the Euphrates, the Aziziyah, Abu Ghuraib, Saqlawi- yah and subsidiary canals. Generally they are good farmers, and one or two of the leading Shaikhs have displayed a desire for progress in methods of farming. Evidence of this is the appearance of several motor ploughing machines in the Ramadi district. The Dulaim cultivators did not suffer through the 1920 insurrection as did the tribes of the Lower Euphrates, as they were able in most cases to sow their crops during August69 Pleader- named 'umbering u on both (aim. r ators, tie idem wlo 'tween tie b nomadic Euphrates ^ area or d element uantity of big in tie itter than . normally yah, ith whom b, In the ' north as im are at i relations nomadic, eeders (in th of the rders and Damascus bred con- demands 1 steadily jy held in e on both , Saqlam- 1 farmer dadesire his is the rough the hrates, as ig August and September when other tribes were either out fighting or had fled from their lands. The crops produced by the Dulaim are chiefly wheat, barley, rice, bhoosa, mash, maize and dukhn, while dates and other fruits such as apples, figs and pomegranates are grown in gardens surrounding the towns. They export grain both up and down the Euphrates to the large market towns on the river, and also to Kubaisah and Rahhaliyah for sale to the desert tribes and for trans-desert market towns. The Dulaim are well armed, their proximity to the desert making it a matter of comparative ease for them to obtain rifles and ammunition at all times. They are noted as thieves and raiders, and have displayed good fighting qualities both against other tribes and against Turkish troops before the war. Each year when the time came for the Turkish authorities to assess the crops of the Dulaim, the latter came into contact with Turkish troops and in many cases the regular troops suffered defeat at the hands of the tribesmen. ^ At the present day the outstanding figure in the Dulaim is iShaikh Ali ibn Sulaiman ibn Bakr, who is now paramount chief of the whole tribe. It is not, as is the case in many tribes of Mesopotamia, a mere figure of speech to say that Ali bulaiman is paramount chief. Since the British occupation of the whole of the Dulaim division he has steadily increased his influence and power over the tribe, until to-day he can rely upon practically every sub-section to follow him in whatever policy he chooses to adopt. That he has taken up a decidedly pro-British attitude is due probably more to the fact that he realises his interests and wealth in the form of extensive landed property near Ramadi depend upon his friendship for the existing Govern ment (no matter what it be), than for any real love for the British. The fact remains, however, that it was the personality and influence of Ali Sulaiman which held the Dulaim together and kept them on the right side during the disturbances both in the spring and summer of 1920. Other Shaikhs who have in a lesser degree assisted us since the armistice are Mushhin ibn Hardan and Shaukah ibn Mutlaq, both of whom have considerable influence over their own par ticular sections, but they have been dominated by Ali Sulaiman. Shaukah is not reliable. After the fall of Baghdad in March, 1917, the territory of the Dulaim was still occupied by the Turks until the capture of Ramadi in September of that year, when Ali Sulaiman made submission. Prior to this, however, the Dulaim assisted the Turks against us. In April, 1919, from four to six men of the Albu Qartan sub-section of the Dulaim, aided by some (C4206) D 370 200 tribesmen of the Zoba’, murdered Lieutenant-Colonel Magniac, commanding the 27th Punjabis, whilst returning to Fallujah from Mufraz Post. On the fall of Ramadi that portion of the tribe within our lines behaved satisfactorily ; Nijris ibn Qaud, the notorious chief of the Albu Nimr section, elected to remain with the Turks as his territory was still under Turkish occupation, and he did not make submission until the capture of Anah in October, 1918. Nijris ibn Qaud attained notoriety in pre-war days as a man of wild character, never at peace for long with any form of established government, and the leader of numerous daring raids ; he was always a thorn in the side of the Turkish authori ties. Since our occupation he has maintained this reputa tion, although for a brief spell after his submission he displayed signs of wishing to atone for his past misdeeds. His naturally lawless inclinations were, however, apparently too strong for him, and after actively participating in the disturbances on the Upper Euphrates in the spring of 1920 and subsequent misbehaviour he remained an outlaw until June, 1920, when he again made submission and voluntarily resigned the Shaikh- ship of his section in favour of his son Ma’ajil. He was per mitted to live on his garden at Hit under a guarantee of Rs. 10,000. Generally, the political attitude of the Dulaim has remained satisfactory, with the exception of one or two sections which took part in the disturbances in early 1920. The Albu Mahal section under Aftan al Sharqi, portions of the Albu Nimr under Nijris ibn Qaud, and the Jaghaifah threw in their lot with the Aqaidat when they sided with the Syrian Government. Hie activity of the hostile Dulaim sections took the form of raids on our lines of communication and attacks on detached garrisons. Hostile elements from these sections were again active against us in the insurrection of the summer of 1920. In August of that year they attacked Anah, which was occupied by a British Assistant Political Officer supported by Ali Sulaiman and a tribal following of friendly Dulaim. Together with the townsmen of Rawah they forced the Assistant Political Officer and Ali Sulaiman to retire downstream from Anah. Aftan al Sharqi, of the Albu Mahal section, eventually came in and made submission in January, 1921. After the 1920 insurrection had been finally subdued and Shaikh Dhari ibn Dhahir of the Zoba’ tribe, who was respon sible for the murder of Lieutenant-Colonel Leachman, had fled, many sections of that tribe agreed to acknowledge Ah Sulaiman as their paramount chief and become part of the Dulaim. These Zoba’ sections each paid a fine of rifles and71 ■t'Mone] ammunition which was imposed as a punishment for their implication in the insurrection, but were not totally disarmed. It is quite probable, however, that they have by now purchased Khinout new rifles to replace those surrendered and that their armed notorious strength is the game as it was previously.

Although the Zoba’ have now practically ceased to exist as a main tribe or confederation, it is perhaps easier and more convenient to deal with the sections (or independent tribes as many of them have now become) under the old heading by which they were known. After the murder of Lieutenant-Colonel Leachman in August, 1920, Dhari ibn Dhahir, the erstwhile paramount Shaikh of the Zoba’, who was responsible for the murder, became a fugitive from justice. The tribe subsequently split up, each section becoming more or less independent, although eventually several sections attached themselves to the Dulaim and accepted Shaikh Ali Sulaiman as their paramount chief. (For details of these sections see list below and tribal lists.) The Zoba’ are a Sunni tribe and believed to be of Shammar origin. They settled in the country between Khan Nuqtah, Aqqur Quf and the left bank of the Euphrates. About three-quarters of the whole tribe are settled cultivators, the remainder being nomad sheep and camel breeders who wander in the Jazirah for their winter grazing. Dira’, the brother of Dhari, leads the nomad element, and he controls some 500 fighting men. He is the chief of the Hammam section, who are all nomadic. He was forbidden to return to the Dulaim division in consequence of his having given shelter to his brother Dhari when the latter was fleeing from justice, but in June, 1921, he was again permitted to return. Always a turbulent tribe, they were never at any time well under the control of their paramount Shaikhs, and many sections refused to accept their authority. They gave us considerable trouble after the occupation of Baghdad. On 9th April, 1917, a large body of Zoba’, about 1,500 in strength, attacked one of our posts at the head of the Radhwaniyah canal and besieged the garrison for several days, until driven off by a resolute sortie, combined with the operations of a relief column from Fallujah. On 27th April in the same year they were mainly responsible for the murder of Lieutenant-Colonel Magniac of the 27th Punjabis near Mufraz Post. For the remainder of the summer of that year the Zoba’ contributed to the mixed bands of raiders which harassed the district between Musaiyib and Fallujah, so much so that all movements in that area ceased, except those of military formations. After the fall of Ramadi in September, 1917, Dhari ibn Dhahir came in, and the tribe made submission.They gave no further trouble until the summer of 1920. On 12th August of that year Lieutenant-Colonel C. E. Leachman.. C.I.E., D.S.O., the Political Officer of the Dulaim division, was treacherously murdered near Khan Nuqtah by Shaikh Dhari and his two sons, Sulaiman and Khamis. This was the signal for the whole of the Zoba’ to rise and join the insurrection. The railway and telegraph lines between Baghdad and Fallujah were cut, and Ramadi and Fallujah were isolated. Troops covering the work of reconstruction on the Baghdad-Fallujah railway occasionally engaged parties of Zoba’ at long range, but were never able to get at close quarters with them. After being submitted to intensive aerial bombing, Shaikh Dhari fled northwards into the Jazirah and is now an outlaw. With the flight of Dhari the Zoba’ began to display signs of breaking up, and on 19th September Shaikhs of the Hitawiyin, Kurushiyin, Faiyadh, Sumailat and Shuwartan sections came into Fallujah prior to proceeding to Ramadi to make formal submission to the Political Officer of the Dulaim division. These were soon followed by the remaining sections of the tribe, all of whom, after making submission, subse quently paid fines in rifles and ammunition which were imposed as a punishment for the part they played in the insurrection. These fines did not amount to total disarmament, as it was realised that it was essential for the Zoba’ sections to retain sufficient arms for their own protection owing to their proximity to the desert and other fully armed tribes. Below is given a list of Zoba’ sections which have either become part of the Dulaim or set up as independent tribes. Sections which now form part of the Dulaim. Luhaib. Shuwartan. Bani Zaid. Kurushiyin. *Qara-Ghul. Sa’adan. Shiti. Subaihat. Sumailat. Sections which have set up as independent tribes. Chitadah. Faddaghah. Haiwat. Hitawiyin. Sha’ar.

The Qara- Ghul of the Zoba’ is a small colony from this tribe.mmCHAPTER VII. Personalities. ABBAS AL JASSAM.—Shaikh of the Jumailah, Fallujah district. Born about 1870. His father, Jassam, was a sarkal of the Albu Ramlali section of the Jumailah. In 1901 Kadhim Pasha, in return for good work done by Abbas al Jassam as sarkal of the Albu Ramlah when cultivating Kadhim Pasha’s Tapu property at Husai (on right bank of the Euphrates near Fallujah), appointed him as Shaikh of the Jumailah in place of the then Shaikh, one Mashkur al Khalaf, who was a bad character. Shaikh Abbas filled his post capably, and is still by far the most reliable of the Fallujah district Shaikhs. A middle- aged, hale and hearty man, with a direct and honest manner, he exercises a strong hold over his tribe, who obey his orders when Government tasks have to be carried out, without the necessity for any Government pressure. He is fairly well-to-do, and his circumstances have been still further improved by the opening of the Saqlawiyah canal upon which his tribe have a large holding. He has throughout assisted the British to the best of his ability. ABDUL HAMID ABU RISHA.—Shaikh of the Albu Chulaxb, north of Ramadi on the right bank. His father, Sulaiman al V usuf, was a man of character and independence. Abdul Hamid has rather fallen to low estate and depends on Ali Sulaiman. He has, however, some influence, more especially in desert places, as a man of knowledge of tribal customs. ABDUL LATIF IBN ABDUL RAHMAN.—Late Rais Baladiyah of Anah. Abdul Latif is a man of about 60 years of age and of very fine presence. He comes from a family which has always been the most influential in Anah. Person ally, he is a nice old man, very polite, hospitable in the extreme, and about as conceited as he is stupid, but very honest withal. He is wealthy from his properties, and his business as a merchant, but chiefly from the gold he has inherited. His influence in Anah is considerable, but the Turks always disregarded this, importing other men as Rais, and suspecting Abdul Latif whenever Anah objected to them. At the beginning of the war a Yuzbashi was murdered one night for assaulting a woman, and Abdul Latif openly expressed his approval. For this he was imprisoned for 18 months in Baghdad. Again, after we withdrew from Anah in the 'spring raid of 1918, he was imprisoned by the Turks for his British sympathies, and only released on their finally withdrawing from Anah in the autumn of 1918. His personal sympathies are all with us. and he has a large following in Anah.91 'allujat sary )ne by ivating of the of the ftalaf, far the niddle- lanner, ordeis ut the instill canal ighout Albu ather, lence, dson Rais years imily irson- reme, ithal. hant, cein this, Latif f the man, is he rwe TO only umn has ABDUL RAZAK IBN HAMAD AL DHIAB.—A large landowner, living in Hit town, of much influence with the people. ABDUL RAZZAQ AL MUNIR.—Age about 50 ; a native of Tekrit. During the Turkish regime he was a lawyer, and at one time represented Basrah in the Turkish Parliament. Acted as a Turkish agent during the war and later worked with Ajaimi. After the occupation of Dair-al-Zor by Ramadhan Shallash in December, 1919, he was appointed Governor of Mayadin by Maulud Pasha and eventually became Qaimmaqam of Albu Kamal. In June, 1921, hearing of the proclamation of general amnesty, he came down to Tekrit and wrote to the High Commissioner, asking to be allowed to return to his home. ABDUL WAHAB IBN ABDUL HAMID.—Late Rais Baladiyah of Hadithah, Anah district. Abdul Wahab is a very pleasing middle-aged man and is acknowledged as the leading citizen of Hadithah. He owns a lot of property there, and has considerable business as a merchant. His reputation for honesty and acuteness is admitted everywhere, although he is a man who always drives a hard bargain. During the war he was fined many times for supposed British sympathies, whereas he actually sat quiet in Hadithah, and assisted neither us nor the Turks. ABDULLAH AL MUHAMMAD AL SHAHIR.—The present Shaikh of the Halabsah section of the Dulaim, cultivating on the Saqlawiyah Canal, Fallujah district. A young man about 25 years of age, active and energetic, and he has a fairly strong hold over his section, which he uses to our advantage. His meanness and fondness of money, however, are notorious throughout the district and the poor hospitality he offers has become a byword. AFT AN IBN SHARQI.—Commonly known as Ibn Sharqi. Shaikh of the Albu Mahal section of the Dulaim, Anah district. Aftan is a young man 23 years of age of a pleasing appearance and polite in his manner. He is literate and, though he has never been out of his tribal area, he shows a remarkable grasp of the geography of the country. He has a very firm hold indeed of his tribe, and so far as one can judge rules with a certain regard to justice. He succeeded to the Shaikhship six years ago on the death of his father, and has successfully beaten all the intrigues of his uncles to displace him on the grounds of his youth. He owns a certain amount of land near A1 Qaim, and, as a Badawin Shaikh goes, is fairlywealthy. He keeps a very poor state, however, and is rather keen on money, which he prefers to lavish on his personal adornment rather than on his madhif (guest house). He professes Turkish sympathies, but was responsible for many robberies and raids on supply dumps and convoys. The Turks never retaliated until after the return of our raid on Anah in the spring of 1918, when they imprisoned him. His tribes men appeared in force, however, and at the moment troops and gendarmes were so few that he was freed. Aftan never actually did anything against us during the war, but in May, 1920, following the evacuation of Albu Kamal, he joined the Sharifian party and took part in attacks on our convoys on the Euphrates. He maintained a truculent attitude until January, 1921, when he came in and made submission. Aftan is on good terms with the surrounding Shaikhs, with the exception of AH Sulaiman. AHMAD AL BASRI.—A man about 35 years of age. Under the Turks he was employed in the Revenue Department. He is a native of Dair-al-Zor, but has been many years resident m Mayadin, where his home now is. Was President of the Mayadin Municipality under the British. Was most active m stirring up trouble, and collected supplies, etc., for the Arab forces. A dangerous man. ALT AL ’AIYASH.—Shaikh of the Jaghaifah, Anah district. He is a man of about 50 years of age, of a rather unprepossessing appearance, but has a singularly pleasing manner. He is a very intelligent old man and constantly proclaims that he rules his tribe by diplomacy and not by force. He has land at Hadithah, and is rather keener on cultivation than on roaming the desert. It is chiefly due to his influence that his tribe is little given to raiding. He wants to live a peaceable life and has tried to steer clear of all the Dulaim inter-tribai politics. For many years he has kept clear of all the minor Dulaim squabbles and acknowledges no man as his head. He invariably raises objections to all orders he receives but in the end he carries them out. ALI AL SULAIMAN AL BAKR.—Paramount Shaikh of the Dulaim and a man of great influence throughout the division. His own section is the Rudaini. Aged about 50, he is by far the wealthiest man in the Ramadi district. He owns valuable properties in the vicinity of Ramadi, and his fondness for money will always guarantee his support to settled govern ment, and he will exert himself energetically in the maintenance of law and order when he fears that his pocket may be affected.93 Prior to the British occupation of Ramadi, Ali al Sulaiman was Shaikh of the Albu Assaf and a few minor sub-sections, but since 1917 his authority has steadily increased and he is now acknowledged as Shaikh by the Albu Fahad. A great diplomatist, he remained with the Turks, affording them, however, little active support until he saw definitely that the day was going against them, when he came in to us. He is a man of action, and displayed his readiness to give the Government material assistance in the disturbances of both the spring and summer of 1920. He is inclined to view the new Arab Government with doubt and suspicion, and would prefer the maintenance of a British mandate. He declined the offer of Government office in the Dulaim Liwah. ASWAD IBN MUHAMMAD AMIN.—A leading merchant of Ramadi, but uneducated and not capable of looking far ahead. He is, however, enterprising and the best man to carry out risky contracts. BURGESS IBN HODAIB.—Also a Shaikh of the ’Sba, of whom there are four leading Shaikhs :— Ibn Hodaib Ibn Umaina Ibn Murshid Ibn Fagagi. DHARI AL DHAHIR.—Shaikh of the Zoba’, Fallujah district. Born about 1873. Became Shaikh on the death of his father, Shaikh Dhahir ibn Shaikh Mahmud, in 1901. In appearance is short and unusually* dark, with left eye blind. Was hostile to the British after the occupation of Baghdad and Fallujah but came in eventually towards the end of the summer of 1917. During his hostility his brother Dhira acted for a short time as Shaikh of the Zoba’ but was found entirely unreliable. Dhari was consequently restored to his position as Shaikh when he came in. He was of good behaviour until August, 1920. On 1 2th August of that year he and his two sons Khamis and Sulaiman were responsible for the murder of Lieutenant-Colonel Leachman, the Political Officer of the Dulaim division, near Khan Nuqtah. This act precipitated the Zoba’ into the 1920 insurrection and eventually resulted in Dhari becoming an outlaw. After intensive aerial bombing he fled northwards into the Jazirah and to-day he remains a fugitive from justice. FAHAD BEG IBN HADHDHAL.—Paramount Shaikh of the Amarat section of the Anizah ; now an old man of about 70 years of age.Came in to us in Juno, 1917, after the fail of Baghdad. Visited the Civil Commissioner and the Army Commander in June, 1917, at Baghdad, where he entered into an agreement with us to prevent contraband reaching the Turks by caravan routes going westwards from Karbala and Najaf. On the whole this agreement was well and faithfully carried out, and Fahad Beg was and still is paid a substantial subsidy by us, out of which he maintains a standing force of about 400 men mounted on horses and camels. Has a great reputation throughout the desert as a statesman and an authority on Arab etiquette and usages. Is now, owing to his advancing age, losing his grip on affairs to a certain extent, and the leadership of the tribe is getting more and more into the hands of his son Mahrut, a young man of about 22 years of age (q.v.). Fahad enjoys the somewhat empty privilege of being hereditary Qaimmaqam of Razazah, an estate on the tail end of the Husairiiyah canal about 12 miles west of Karbala. The title and estate were both granted to his father by the Turks. Fahad has always been friendly to the British and is not well inclined to a Sharifian Government. FAHAD AL HILLAL.—Has been recognised by us as the Shaikh of the Albu Nimr section of the Dulaim, but he has very little influence with them. Has a personal reputation of being a good fighter. FARIS AL SAIYAH (Dimim Section of the Aqaidat ).—He apparently learned early that money is the root of all power, and that enemies interfered with money making. He made peace with all tribes on terms that the average Arab would have scorned, and got on with money making, at which he has shown marked ability. In 1918 there was a famine in his district and Paris did very well by cornering wheat. He does an extensive business as a money-lender. As mukhtar of Musulakhah he is entitled to a percentage on sales of ghi, wool, sheep, etc., and he has not been ashamed to piit in petitions for sums of Rs. 10 and under due to him from this source. GHADHWAN IBN MURSHID.—A Shaikh of the ’Sba, a section of the Anizah, living in the desert between Dair-al-Zoi and Damascus. HABIB AL SHALLAL.—Shaikh of the Muhamdah section of the Dulaim, I allujah district. Bom about 1880 and became Shaikh on the death of his father in 1912. Pro-British and a well-meaning but weak Shaikh. His lack of influence is primarily due to his poverty, but with the opening of the95 ( Saqlawiyah canal his circumstances should improve, when it is hoped his hold over his tribe wdll increase accordingly. HAJI HAMMADI AL ARATM.—Head of a big house of merchants in Ramadi, with relations as agents in Hit and Fallujah. An honest-dealing man with a large influence in the towns and in good relations with Ali Sulaiman. A man of sound common sense. HARAT AL JASIM.—Shaikh of the Albu Isa, Fallujah district. Born about 1858 and succeeded his father in 1890. The latter was shot at his home at the instigation of the Turkish Government for unruly conduct. Harat is accordingly anti-Turkish. He is very decrepit and old, but has a wide reputation of having been all that a good Shaikh should be. Even now his hold on his tribe is good. His son Aifan, a man of about 28 years of age, is beginning to carry on his father’s duties. HARDAN AL ABDUL HAMID.—Dulaim, Ramadi district, Shaikh of the Albu Aithah section. An old man about 70 years of age. Came in to us in the autumn of 1917 after the fall of Ramadi, and was later deported to India on a charge of communicating with the enemy. In 1920 was allowed to return, and has since bored his tribesmen with wonderful tales of all that he saw in India, w r here he is said to have passed himself for a holy man, thereby gaining considerable financial advantage. This is quite believable, Hardan being an old gentleman of distinguished and venerable appearance. IBRAHIM AL SHU’AIBI.—A man of about 50 years of age. Belongs to the Albu Sarai, but has resided in the town of Mayadin for many years. He is a cousin of Ramadhan al Shallash, with whom he was hand in glove. Took a leading and conspicuous part in pro-Muslim anti-British propaganda, and used all his influence to stir up both the townsmen and the tribes against us. A dangerous man. His son was Qadhi under us in Mayadin ; he is a man of the same type as his father and joined him in all his activities. ISMAIL EFFENDI IBN HASAN AGHA.—Born about 1878. Rais Baladiyah of Fallujah. An inhabitant of Baghdad, but has been in Fallujah for the last 26 years, cultivating property at Jubail near Fallujah. Became Rais Baladiyah of Fallujah in the summer of 1917 and has carried out his duties most efficiently ever since. Has an imposing presence and is generally respected and feared throughout the district. IBN JANDAL.—Of the Ruwallah under Nuri Sha’lan. Living in the Syrian desert.JASIM IBN TAHA HAJI.—Late Rais Baladiyah of Hit. One of the largest landowners in the district and probably one of the wealthiest. Has a number of gardens in the northern suburbs of Hit. Has proved himself willing to assist to his utmost in our administration, and has been so far scrupulously honest. KHARBIT IBN JASIM AL JUHAISH.—Dulaim, Ramadi district. Has recently become Shaikh of the Albu Khalifah section in succession to Faraj al Ghudaib, who absconded. A man of 55 years of age. MAHRUT IBN HADHDHAL.—Son of Fahad Beg, para-' mount Shaikh of the Anizah ’Amarat. The latter has now grown very old and the affairs of his tribe were in the hands of his eldest son who died suddenly in January, 1919. Mahrut succeeded him as his father’s representative. Mahrut is a young man about 22 years of age, rather above the average height for a Badawin. His main object at present is to win his spurs and to acquire a reputation as a leader of tribal raids. Although quiet and reserved, appears to have the makings of a capable Shaikh, and he should be able to maintain his position on the death of his father in spite of a powerful rival claimant, Fahad al Dughaiyim {q.v.). IBN MA’JIL.—Ibn Ma’jil of the Ruwallah (Anizah), head of Jalas section, living in the Syrian desert under the suzerainty of Nuri Sha’lan. MAULUD IBN MUKHLUS PASHA.—A native of Tekrit. Colonel in the Sharif’s Army. Aged 42. Commanded the Turkish cavalry at Shuaibah, and was previously for two years private secretary to Ibn Rashid. Joined the Sharif and is considered one of the best officers in the Arab Army ; eight times wounded, and was awarded the D.S.O. in 1918. Is a red-hot Nationalist, and wishes to see Arab independence established in Iraq without a British mandate. In 1919 was appointed Military Governor of Dair-al-Zor, from which place he consistently worked against the British by stirring up the tribes and endeavouring to persuade us to retire to the Wadi Hauran, which the Arab Government claim as their legal boundary. Is reported to have returned to Damascus in June, 1920. A dangerous man, being a trained military officer and an expert at the dissemination of propaganda. There is reason to believe that he is in regular correspondence with the Nationalist leaders in Iraq.( 97 MISHRIF AL MUHAMMAD AL DINDIL.—A wild man but extremely simple. Prior to British occupation his mode of living was robbery of small caravans, generally accompanied by murder, and lacking the show and splash of a raid. He and the drones of the Hassun section of the Aqaidat do not know what to do with themselves these days. MIZBAN IBN SHAUKAH.—A large landowner at Hit on the left bank. A man of influence in the district. MUHAMMAD IBN KHIDR.—Age about 30 years. Was formerly member of the Court of First Instance in Mayadin under the Turks, but was unemployed during our occupation. Was most active in the movement against us, assisting it to the best of his power. MUHAMMAD SATD IBN SAIYID ABDUL KARIM SAIYID.—Born about 1857, and is by origin a Baghdadi. Came to Radhwaniyah in Fallujah district about 34 years ago and cultivated there for 25 years. For the last six years he has resided in Fallujah. Wealthy, but keeps open house in Fallujah and spends all he makes. Knows all the tribes and Shaikhs intimately and is on friendly terms with them. Is strongly pro-British and well known and respected throughout the Fallujah district. He is a genial stout old man, whose influence is all to our good. The value of this is apparent since every tribesman of high or low degree visiting Fallujah can usually be found enjoying the free hospitality of Muhammad Sa’id’s house. MUHAMMAD IBN TURKI IBN MIJLAD.—Chief of the Dahamshar sub-tribe of the 'Amarat. He is anything but obedient to Fahad Beg and is at present in pretty close touch with Fahad al Dughaiyim. MUHSIN AFFANDI.—Is a man of about 35-40 years of age. He is a native of Dhibban near Mayadin, and belongs to the Albu Chamil section of the Aqaidat. He was formerly a Captain in the Regular Turkish Army, and later took service with the Sharif, who confirmed him in his rank. Took a leading part in stirring up the tribes in the neighbourhood of Albu Kamal against us, and early in February, 1920, he was sent from Mayadin with a party of about 30 horse to verify a report that guns were being sent up by us. This he did, actually firing on the guns on the line of march near Al Qaim on 11th February, 1920. It is probable, though not certain, that he was with the tribes engaged with our troops near Albu Kamal on 14th February, 1920. It appears likely that he was influenced by the intrigues (C4206) ®of Mustafa Kemal Pasha and the Central Anatolian Govern ment, and that ho was in reality working for the return of the Turks to Northern Syria and the Liwah of Dair-al-Zor. MUSHHIN AL HARDAN.—Dulaim, Ramadi district. Son of Hardan al Abdul Hamid, and controlled the Albu Aithah section when his father was away in India, and con tinued to occupy the position of Shaikh after the return of the latter. He has done admirably well and has worked hand in glove with Ali Sulaiman. Between 35 and 40 years of age, he can read and write, but not with ease, and he prefers to use a clerk for all his correspondence. MUSLAT PASHA AL SALIH IBN MILHIM.—Paramount Shaikh of the Jubur on the Khabur. Usually resides near Tel Taban. Is an old man, of about 65 years of age. Through out the war maintained an attitude of neutrality and never gave any active assistance to the Turks. This attitude he has maintained up to date, refusing all assistance to the Arab Government in their anti-British activities. Is an outspoken and courteous old gentleman, much respected throughout the Jazirah, and has stated that rather than see an Arab Govern ment or French mandate established he would welcome the return of the Turks. During the war he always helped our escaped prisoners of war working on the Baghdad railway to get back, and he did the same to parties of deported Armenians. He has remained in close touch with the Turks and is, indeed, their chief stand-by in the Jazirah. NIJRIS IBN QA’UD.—A Shaikh of the Albu Nimr section of the Dulaim. Usually lives in the Jazirah ; was taken as a prisoner to Mosul in 1914 by Muhammad Pasha Daghastani, but was kept in so honourable captivity that it became little more than a farce. He was subsequently allowed to return to his tribe. After the fall of Baghdad he hesitated for some time as to whether he should come in to us, but he subsequently went over to the Turks. The reason for this was in all proba bility because Ali Sulaiman, whom he loathes, had come in to us. He came in when we finally occupied Anah at the end of 1918. Since that date he carried out his duties satisfactorily until March, 1920, when he went over to the Arab Government at Dair-al-Zor. Subsequently he took a leading part in raids on our convoys both on the Euphrates and on the Mosul railway near Shargat. It is not improbable that this change of sides was due to his personal hostility to Ali Sulaiman. Nijris is a tall, fine-looking man of about 45 years of age, and has a great reputation throughout the Jazirah as a leader of raids, which is his one form of amusement. Although by no means wealthy he maintains a considerable state, and is inconsequence heavily in debt. He is however proud of his reputation as a spendthrift. In character wild and almost childish in some of his ideas, he cannot be relied upon to maintain a consistent attitude for any length of time, and he is easily swayed by temporary or local influences. On various occasions he has been submitted to aerial bombing. He made unconditional surrender in June, 1921, and resigned his position as Shaikh to his son, Ma’jil. NURI IBN SHA’LAN AL MUR’IDH.—Paramount chief of the Ruwallah, and perhaps the most powerful individual Badawin chief. In 1914 supplied a considerable number of camels to the Turks, but was not paid, and did not supply them again. Bears a grudge against the Turkish Government on account of his having been imprisoned in Damascus in 1911. 70 years old. Joined the Arab cause after it was clear that it was going to succeed and was much favoured by Faisal to the disgust of the Damascus townsfolk. Proved a broken reed and made terms with the French after Faisal’s defeat. These he subsequently broke, but after various vicissitudes has probably now got a working arrangement with them. An old rival of Fahad Beg, but has recently been in communication with him. RAMADHAN SHALLASH.—Ramadhan Shallash is the son of a Shaikh of the Albu Sarai tribe. Educated at the Military Academy, Constantinople, he served in the Turkish Army, and later as a Turkish secret service agent. Developed pan-Arab sympathies and was appointed A.D.C. to King Husain. He is a friend and disciple of Yasin Pasha, Chief of Staff of the Arab Army. In December, 1919, with a small following he occupied Dair-al-Zor, which was then in our area of administration, and established himself as Governor of that town. After quarreling with Maulud Pasha he was expelled from Dair-al-Zor and proceeded to Tibni. In May, 1921, he was reported to have returned to his tribe, the Albu Sarai. RASHID IBN SUMAIR.—Principal chief of the Wulud Ali, of which tribe his family has long held the chieftainship. He was always very much under the thumb of Nuri till after the French occupation, when they tried, for a time, to make him responsible for all the desert tribes east of Damascus. He was a complete failure, as Nuri would have nothing to do with him. RASHID AL UMARI.—Rashid belongs to the Umari family, one of the oldest and most prominent in Mosul. It traces itsdescent by a somewhat precarious genealogical tree from the Khalif Umar al Khatlab. The most outstanding member is Hadi Pasha, an old man who now lives in Constantinople. He was mentioned as a possible candidate for Amirate of Iraq. Rashid is the most prominent Umari in Iracp He was formerly Mudir of Shaikhan, but finding himself in hot water with the Wali proceeded to Constantinople to obtain the Sultan’s ear. Pie succeeded in getting himself reinstated, but incurred suspicion of treasonable correspondence with two of his kinsmen, who had been exiled to Egypt, and was not allowed to return from Constantinople until the revolution of 1908. On our occupation of Mosul, Rashid became a member of the Balidayah, was invited to Baghdad as supplementary member of the Electoral Committee, but at the instance of the party, of which he was a member, declined the invitation. He was appointed Mutassarif of the Dulaim Liwah in January, 1921, and, without having shown any conspicuous ability as an administrator, has carried on successfully. His son, Ma’ruf, was formerly employed by A.P.O., Mosul district, where he embezzled a considerable sum of Government money, and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. His release after 10 months has made Rashid Effendi inclined to be pro-British. He is a curious character, a strange mixture of pompous dignity and pride of race. He has difficulty in saying what he means—chiefly owing to a nervous disposition, but partially to the chicanery inherent in every Arab. He is credited with a certain amount of ambition, and although far from clever, would show himself tenacious in any policy he adopted. Age about 58. RIJJ1H AL SAT AM.—He has the largest following of that very scattered tribe, the Jaghaifah. He makes appoint of following on the heels of raiding parties. How he keeps his following and flocks is a mystery, as in his dealings with the merchants he is always worsted. SAIYAH AL ABDULLAH AL JIRAH.—Distinguished for low cunning. In manner he is a very pleasant old man, but has little power in the Dimim section of the Aqaidat. This is in the hands of his son Paris. 8 ALIH AL HURAIBI.—About 35 years old. An ex- Turkish official. Was formerly “ Mudir Mai ” (land surveyor) at Albu Kamal and Anah. Was without employment during our administration. Was hand in glove with Ramadhan Shallash, who designated him “ Mudir Mai ” of Albu Kamal, which post he never actually took over. Anti-British and pro-Turk.(C4206) F Resident of Mayadin. Took a leading part in the anti- British crusade amongst the tribes and townspeople. SHAUKAH IBN MUTLAQ AL MUKHLIF.—Dulaim, Ramadi district. Succeeded his father as Shaikh of the Muhammad al Dhiyab section of the Dulaim in 1914. He also controls the cultivators of the Albu Nimr and various extraneous tribes. His influence was about equal to that of Mushhin, q.v., but he has played a double game and is looked on askance by Ali Sulaiman. Now about 25 years old. SULAIMAN AL ABDUL RAHIM.—He is head of the Albu Hardan section of the Aqaidat and a man of ability and great personal charm. Though illiterate he speaks extremely good Arabic. A very intelligent and well-bred tribesman. SULAIMAN AL DAKIL.—Aqaili Qarim, related by mai'riage both to Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud ; settled for some time in Baghdad. An able man of considerable education. Was engaged in journalistic work before the war Is in close touch with the High Commissioner’s office, and was a useful source of information. Appointed Mudir of Kubaisah early in 1921, and transferred as Qaimmaqam to ’Anah when Civil Govern ment was re-established there in May, 1921. TURKI AL HUMUSH.—About 30 years of age ; was formerly a Turkish official in the Revenue Department. He was conscripted by the Turks, but subsequently joined the Sharif’s army as a sergeant-major. He was brought from Aleppo by Ramadhan Shallash as his clerk, and being a native of Mayadin he was sent there. He is a dangerous man and was engaged in anti-British intrigue. UMAR IBN ABDUL AZIZ.—A man of about 40 years of age. A native of Dair-al-Zor. Formerly in Turkish employ in the Small Cause Court. Was hand in glove with Ramadhan Shallash, who appointed him Qaimmaqam of Mayadin, which JJlace he visited twice, but returned to Dair. Was Intelligence Officer to Maulud Pasha. He belonged to the anti-British party in Dair-al-Zor and took a prominent part in the imprisonment and subsequent expulsion of our officials. A very dangerous man. HAJI YASSIN IBN HAJI TAHIR.—A man of some character, who has risen from being Rais Baladiyah of Hit, and is now Mudir of Fallujah. His brother Haji Ali, who is older than Haji Yassin, owns gardens at Hit.CHAPTER VIII. Communications . General. —All routes on the Upper Euphrates are governed by the predominant question of water supply. As far as possible the main roads between the riverain towns follow the river closely, while those across the Jazirah to the Tigris or across the desert to Damascus and Aleppo are compelled to follow a line indicated by the presence of wells and springs. The fact that we had a division operating up the Euphrates during the war has produced a good first-class road on the right bank from Sinn adh Dhibban to midway between Ramadi and Hit, but beyond this most of the other routes consist of desert tracks which become impassable for wheeled traffic after rain, and in the summer have stretches of sand and dust which make very heavy going. Method of Travelling .—Although the motor car has made its appearance on the main roads the expense, unreliability and question of petrol supply of native-owned cars are difficulties which will have to be overcome before this means of conveyance is adopted for general use. The Arabanah, pack horse, donkey and camel still hold their own as the principal method of travel. Railways. —A light Decauville railway runs between Baghdad and Fallujah, but there is every probability of this line being abandoned in the near future owing to maintenance, expense and inability to show a profit. Inland Water.—Vide Chapter on Geography. Telegraphs .—In the area under British administration the following towns are connected with Baghdad by telegraph line :— (i) Fallujah, (hi) Hit (through Ramadi), (ii) Ramadi, (iv) Anah (through Ramadi). Kubaisah is connected with Hit by telephone. In the area under the administration of the Syrian Govern ment a telegraph line runs from Albu Kamal via Dair-al-Zor and Raqqa to Aleppo and Damascus, but the condition of this line is not known. Postal .—A mail service is rim from Baghdad to all towns in the area under British administration vid Fallujah and Ramadi.(C4206) f 2 Aerodrome .—Prepared landing grounds for aeroplanes exist at the following towns :— Fallujah, Hit, Ramadi, Anah. Descriptive details will be found in the chapter on Geography under the sub-heading of “ Towns.” Description of Principal Routes. —( 1 ) DAIR-AL-ZOR- ALEPPO via Euphrates right bank.

Water .—Obtainable at Hit from the Euphrates and at Kubaisah from wells quarter of a mile west-north-west of the town. No good drinking water en route. Supplies .-—A certain amount of grain obtainable at Hit; also sheep from the tribes. Nothing available at Kubaisah, except dates. Grazing .—-Practically nil, except for camels. Fuel .—Scarce. (7) RAMADI—SAMARRAH. (72 miles.) General direc tion north-north-east. The track is followed to Tel Qabr Faraj, mile 4, which crosses many irrigation channels crossed by bridges passable for Ford vans, but would require strengthening for L.A.M.B. cars. Thence onward the route strikes across uninhabited desert along no marked track. The surface is firm and smooth and passable for any vehicle. There are no obstacles. The first stage is sometimes rendered impassable for wheeled traffic by floods during the early spring. Water. —Water exists in wells at the various stages, for details of which see below.

The route is passable for army transport carts throughout the year and for L.A.M.B. cars in dry weather. After heavy rain it would be impassable for motors. The road runs over undulating desert of gravelly surface.There are three main obstacles :— (a) Wadi abu Furqkh has a soft sandy bottom and is impassable for motor cars after heavy rain, but in dry weather is passable for Ford vans and L.A.M.B. cars using running boards or brushwood. (b) At Raudah the ,Wadi al Ghadaf is passable for L.A.M.B. cars in dry weather, but impassable for motors after rain. (c) YY adi Thulaib is 300 yards wide and 6 feet deep, bed soft and sandy, which renders it impassable for motors in wet weather. Water.—(See under stages.) Supplies. —Only dates and sheep could be obtained en route* with a very little grain. Fuel. —-Plentiful supply of brushwood. Grazing. —January to April plentiful in the wadis. Stages. Miles. 1.

The route is suitable throughout for cavalry and infantry with pack-transport. Although unsuitable for heavy lorries or heavy howitzers because of sand and occasional soft going, the route could easily be rendered suitable for field guns, carts and motor cars. For the passage of these a few slight improvements are necessary in the section between Buraidan and Kubaisah, of which the most important is the crossing of the Wadi Muhammadi (at stage 8 ), which requires ramping and levelling. The irrigation cuts at Shifathah (stage 2 ) are not suitably bridged, but this could be effected by means of palm legs, of which many thousands are available. Poi'tions of the section between Karbala and Rahhaliyah are rendered impassable by heavy rain or by inundations caused by overflow from the Abu Dibs lake. Generally, the surface throughout the route is firm and affords good going for field guns and motor cars.Water .—Water is available at each stage either from wells or canals. The wells are generally sulphurous but drinkable. Supplies .—Dates are to be had in large quantities at Shifathah, Rahhaliyah and Kubaisah. Grain and provisions in limited quantities can be obtained at Karbala only. Sheep can be obtained en route from desert tribes. Fuel. —Brushwood and scrub to be found at each stage. Grazing .—For horses in the vicinity of the Abu Dibs lake, Shifathah, Rahhaliyah, Buraidan, Thumailah and Abu Jir between February and April. For camels at all stages. Stages. Miles. 1.

General direc tion north-west. In dry weather the route throughout is passable for L.A.M.B. cars, but, owing to the uncertain condition of the numerous bridges and culverts since our evacuaton of this area, it is doubtful if the road would be passable after heavy rain. Generally the surface is good, with the exception of one or two stretches, which would provide very heavy going in wet weather upstream of Albu Kamal. A umerous obstacles in the nature of wadis and water-cuts are to be encountered, but these could be made passable for L.A.M.B. cars with a little work. Water. —Unlimited the whole way from the Euphrates. Supplies. Cereals and fresh vegetables obtainable at Anah and Dair-al-Zor. Sheep could be purchased en route. Fuel. Brushwood and scrub en route, but plentiful supply of good fuel at Dair-al-Zor. Grazing. —Depends on the quantity of rain, but for horses and cattle. Stages. 1 . Nahiyah 2 . Albu Kamal 3.

Wadi Muhammadi. —No wadis of importance are encountered until the Wadi Muhammadi, eight miles south of Hit, is reached. This is broad and on the whole sandy. It is usually dry. A causeway has been made across it with a bridge to allow the flow of water after rain. In dry weather the wadi can be crossed with difficulty, by L.A.M.B. cars, and is heavy going for lighter vehicles in most places west of the road. The wadi seldom has more than a few pools of brackish rain water in it. 2. Wadi Muslubah. —This is very broad, the bottom soft, and is difficult for wheels. It is usually dry. Except where the northern bank is cliff it is passable. 3. Wadi Marj. —The bottom of this varies considerably. Mud, sand and rock form the bed in various places. This wadi nearly always has water in it. In summer, however, this is only a few inches deep and varies in breadth from 1 yard to 4 to 5 yards. The water is brackish and in summer is very salt, as most of the surrounding country is salt-encrusted. The banks are steep in most places, and often in the form of low cliffs 10 to 20 feet high on the northern side. Its two branches between Sahiliyah and Kubaisah are very similar to the Marj. They are passable in places for all arms. 4. Wadi Khubaz or Sahaliyah. —This usually contains water in the rainy season, but this is only a few inches deep in most places, except immediately after heavy rain. In early summer the water is very salt, and in the rainy season it is brackish. The northern bank is a cliff, which is only surmountable for wheels in very few places. The bed of the wadi is formed of sand and rock in different places, and the crossing is difficult in most places. 5. Wadi Baghdadi. —This is passable at its mouth and at most places more than one mile from its mouth. It is not bridged, but is nearly always dry and offers no difficulty in crossing. 6 . Wadi Asad. —This is bridged and has a crossing for heavy vehicles. Except near its mouth both its banks are high cliffs and are impassable for wheels.7. Wadi Hauran. —This is a broad wadi with sloping banks. It varies in width and when in flood the water is often 50 yards or more in width and impassable. The floods last only a few days, after which the wadi can be forded even after high flood. It is unbridged. This wadi in particular is liable to very sudden flood and the water comes down like a tidal wave. The wadis between the Hauran and Hadithah are big with steep banks, but can be crossed in places, and usually they are dry and offer no obstacle for wheeled traffic at crossings or bridges. The wadis between Hadithah and Albu Kamal are crossed by prepared crossings, xlfter rain many contain water, but can be forded at the crossings. 8 . Wadi Suf ah and Fuhaimah. —(Half way bet ween Hadithah and Anah.) Crossing made, but will be covered after heavy rain. 9. Wadi Ali. —(Two miles south of Albu Kamal.) I looded in high flood. Crossings made two miles upstream of crossing shown on map. A very difficult crossing in wet weather. 10 . Wadi Swaihil. —(Four miles south of Sahaliyah.) Very soft going after rain. Lorries and L.A.M.B. cars stick. In wet weather road runs along side cliffs two mile west of road shown on map, where wadi is crossed fairly easily. 11. Wadi Malha. —(Four miles south of Dair-al-Zor.) Soft sand, but passable fo L.A.M.B. cars, except after wet weather. The liability of all wadis to sudden and unexpected floods in the winter and early spring should always be borne in mind. At such times the wadis become impassable and often remain so for a period of anything up to four or five days. BRIDGES. Bridges over Wadis from Ramadi to Dair-al-Zor. 1. Aziziyah Canal. —Stone bridge. Will take 60 pounders and tractors. 2 . Wadi Muhammadi. —Wooden bridge. 3. Bridge at T. C. 191 (about Y. 24 A 2/1). 4. Brooking Bridge.—(Stone.) Just south-east of Hit, T. C. 191 Y 12d 30/05. 5. Bridge (rail) one mile west of Hit over Wadi Maslubah. 6 . Bridge (rail) two miles north-west of Hit over Wadi Qanan.Ill 7. Bridge (rail) over Wadi Marj or Hasni. 8 . Bridge (stone and rail) over Wadi Sahiliyah. 9. Bridge (stone piers, wooden superstructure) over Wadi Asad at Khan Baghdadi. 10. First Hajlan. —Stone. 11. Second Hajlan. —Stone. 12. Wadi Sufah ] WadiFuhaimah ^Bridges over these are all unsafe. WadiJadidah ( Crossings made. Wadi Qasr J Bridges 2 to 8 and 10 are passable for class 3 lorries, but not for 60 pounder guns. Bridge 9. Class 2 only. Crossings exist by all these bridges for 60 pounder guns and vehicles heavier than class 3. The safety of bridges upstream of Hadithah cannot be guaranteed. FORDS. Local inhabitants state that fords exist at the following places between the months of August and October, the water rarely being more than 3 feet deep at this period. These fords are used by tribal raiding parties consisting of horse, foot and camel. It must be remembered, however, that the site of a ford is liable to change each year. Alus .—8 miles downstream of Hadithah (gravel bottom). Baris. —4| miles upstream of Hadithah (passable all arms). Susah .—10 miles upstream of Hadithah (sandy bottom). Shumiyah .—15 miles upstream of Hadithah (gravel bottom). Mouth of Wadi Qasr. — 6 | miles downstream of Anah (sandy bottom). Ratahah .—36 miles upstream of Anah (sandy bottom).
