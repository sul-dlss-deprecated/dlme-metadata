The Advieer has specifically asked whether Mr.Logsdail should be granted 'diplomatic privileges regarding Customs'.

NNH me /V5 PrFSONAL POLITICAL AGFNCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 24th Januory, 1949 Dear Sir Rupert, You asked me atout the case ending with Stobart's semi-official letter No.R-4-7/9, dated the 5th January, 1949, to Dredge, concerning dip lomatic privileges for Logsdail. The position is that officers get. these privileges regarding Customs, but clerks do not. The question is bound to arise again, I suppose, as further U.K. lased staff come out here, e.g., I suppose the Ministry of Works official will ask for similar privileges; so it might be as well to be cle^r as to what line we are going to adopt in the matter. Yours sincerely His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN, 4th February, 1949. (112/4/49) v \ ;&gt; c'j \sir Rupert^ tells me he has discussed your personal letter of the 24th January about Customs privileges with you. His opinion is that we should let Belgrave have a list of officers whom we regard as of a status entitling them to such privileges. This list would include so far as the Residency is concerned Johnson who holds here only a temporary appointment and shall be leaving us shortly, Hall who is expected in the near future as archivist, and Powell and Logsdail for so long as they can be regarded as members of the Residency staff, in addition to the officers of regular diplomatic status. Any alterations in the list would be notitied to the Bahrain Government. If you see no objection I am to ask you to discuss this proposal informally with Belgrave and report the result. If you consiaer it desirable you can make it clear that no claim for refund of Customs duties will be made in^ respect of articles purchased in the bazzar except in special circumstances e.g. a claim might be made in respect of a new motor vehicle purchased by an entitled officer irom a local dealer. It is presumed that all articles imported for official purposes, including building materials, will continue to be exempt from Customs duties. C.J. Pelly, Esq., C.o.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 19th March, 1949. Dear Belgrave, Your memorsr.durii No.266-S-9A, dated the 27th Novemter, 1948, has raised the whole question of British Government officers and officials who should te granted Custons privileges here. Sir Rupert Kay is of the opinion that we should let you have a 3ist of officers whom we regard as of a status entitling them to such privileges. This list would include,as far as the Re sidency is concerned,Johnson who holds here only a tem- here porary appointment one Hall who is expected/as Admi nistrative Officer in the near future, Powell of the Ministry of Works, and Logsdail of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, in addition to the officers of regular diplomatic status. Any alterations in the list will be notified to the Bahrain Government. Do you think this would he all right? I have been asked to discuss the case with you. but I have had the papers on my desk for so long not managing to do it that I am writing to you instead. I am to make it clear that no claim for refund of Customs duties will be made in respect of articles pur chased in the bazaar except in special circumstances, e.g. a claim might be made in respect of a new motor vehicle purchased by an entitled officer from a local dealer. It is presumed that all articles imported for of ficial purposes, including building materials, will con tinue to be exempt from Customs duties. Perhaps C.D.

Regarding para 2, I suggest that should any claim of this type be made it should be forwarded to us by the head of the department in which the claimant works.
