My home country is Jiwani. Six months ago I proceeded in the boat from Jiwani to Karachi and thence to Goa. From the latter port I shipped charcoal and cocoanuts for Bahrain. About three months ago I left Goa for Bahrain. On my way coming, I visited Jiwani where I remained for three days, and then left for Bahrain. When I was at Jiwani I heard that a boat broke at the entrance of the bay and shattered. I did not know the contents of the broken boat, nor did I know who took possession of the gear or shattered pieces of the boat. (Reply to a question.) If any thing on my boat proved by Haji Ali bln Moba that it belongs to him and it was taken from the broken boat, I am prepared to hand over the whole boat to the Sarkar (British Government) . r Signature of Nakhuda JalaiGTC • &lt; Political Agent, Bahrain.

I had a cargo of cement from Karachi for the R.A.F. at Jiwani Bay. On arrival at the entrance to Jiwani Bay, I went ashore to inform the H.A.P. office about the arrival of my boat. In my absence the boat hit a submerged rock, and the sea started to come in. On finding this I again went to the R.A.F. and asked them to send some boats to salvage the cement, but they would not do this. Actually, I only saw an Indian, called Sheikh, who was in the R.A.F. employ. I spent that night in my boat, bailing out the water which was leaking in. The next morning I went to an R.A.F. office, near the sea, but there were only Indians there. At my request they sent out a launch to tow in my boat, but the man in charge of the launch said it was impossible to do this, as my boat was too full of water and as the tide was going out. After this I went and reported the matter to the mastaufi, who was the representative of the Kalat Government there. He did not write down my report but directed me to one Kioda Aziz, a headman of Jiwani. I went to the latter and explained to him about the boat, and asked him either to hire some persons to save the boat, or,, if he prefeired, to arrange to salvage it for SO per cent of the cost of the boat. He replied that he was prepared to rescue the removable gear on payment of half its cost. I told him that I could easily remove that gear myself with the help of my sailors, and I then went back to the boat. That evening my sailors and I stayed in a small'fort at the entrance of the Bay. On the following morning I saw some 'persons go down to the boat and remove 12 iron gates, which were part of the cargo lying on the deck, and I also saw them take away the removable gear. I went to Khoda Aziz and asked him by whose order this had been done. He replied- 2 'Go to the H.A.P. and If they order delivery I will deliver the gear to you*” I told him the boat did not belong to the R.A.P# but was only hired by themi so I would not go to them. I then went again to the mastaufl and reported what had happened# He did not record my statement but sent for Khoda Aziz and spoke to him# I did not understand their language, but I gathered that the U mastaufi blamed Kjpda Aziz for removing the gear without my consent. The mastaufi then rang up the*R.A.F# about this and I understood that they replied that they had ordered Khoda Aziz to send some persons to salvage only the iron gates, and not my ship^ gear. After this Khoda Aziz, in the presence of the mastaufi, demanded 5s* 1,000/- as his salvage fee# I rejected his request as I had not agreed to pay him anything for removing the gear. He then refused to hand over the Q5ar to me. I stayed in Jiwani for ten days longer, but was unable to recover the gear, in spite of my making further complaints to the mastaufi. The latter told me he could not recover the gear for me unless I paid Ss*1,000/- to Khoda Aziz. Then, as my sailors pressed to be sent home, I took them to Gwadar. By this time the cement in the boat had solidi fied, and the boat had become a total wreck. Its planks drifted to the shore and Khoda Aziz had them collected. While staying at Gwadar I visited Jiwani on three occasions and tried to get back my gear. By this time there was a new mastaufi in Jiwani and, he said that if I gave Khoda Aziz Rs.600/-, that would be enough, but I refused to do this, nor was Khoda Aziz willing to accept Es.500/-. My various statements were NOT recorded in writing by the mastaufi at Jiwani. During my visits to Jiwani from Gwadar the new mastaufi took either two or three statements from me. He did not have my thumb impressions put on them*KVI 56 /S KARACHI 32 16 2123 = LC RPFCS6.95 POLITICAL AGENT BAHREIN = JALI BOAT SHAMHAN NAKHUDA ABDULA ISSA OWNER IBRAHIM BUHIND.I LOADED 640 BAGS RICE SAILED ON 20TH FEBRUARY FOR MARAMGOA BUT NOT REACHED DEST OWNER VESSEL WHEREABOUT = / ZAMZAM I NAT I ON PLEASE ENQUIRE P'4-6 J4D f 14 • S’ ^1^6 MARK YOUR REPLY $7n/ie?uaC NO ENQUIRY RESPECTING THIS TELEGRAM CAN BE ATTENDED TO WITHOUT PRODUCTION Of THIS COPY.

SHARJAHCOPY Statement of Nakhuda Mohammed bin Said of Has al- Khaimah, recorded at the British Agency, Slarjah, on the 29th August 1950. On the 13th Sha’aban 1369 (31st May 1950) I sailed from Has al Khalmah for Minab (south of Persia), but owing to bad weather I was compelled to shelter in the neighbourhood of Basidu island. While we were near the island, the Persian Government launch, which patrols the south coast of Persia, approached us and 12 of the Persian Government Customs employees jumped into the dhow. Without any inquiry they took my available cash, a sum of fis. 300 and 2200 tomans and eonfiscatec the goods which I had in my dnow, consisting of three bags baf sugar, 2 cases and half tea and one bag of tea belonging to a sailor of my dhow. I had in my possession a manifest issued by the Ruler of Has al Khaimah, but the Persian Governmen' 1 authorities discovered an oversight in the date of manifest, i.e., date of issue 13 th Sha * a ban 1369 (31st May 1950) while we were in the month of Hajab (April). They confiscated the above goods on the ground that the manifest was wr&lt;bng • They toofc us to Bandar Abbas for investigations, where we remained there for 17 days. They forced mo to sign a document brought by the Customs authorities (which was unknown to me). I refused, tc do so; but as I consicered iu\ position as a foreigner in that place, I signed the document. After I was released with my crew from Bandar Abbas I returned to Has al Khaimah and reported the case to Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad, Ruler of Ras- al Khaimah. y x is L.T.I. of Nakhuda Mohammad bin Said of Has al Khaimah.(59/28/50) CONFIDENTIAL .

With the protracted absence of Admiral Zelli from his post, I called on Colonel Amin, his deputy, with S.N.O.P.G's approval, and arranged to discuss the matter at S.N.O.P.G's final visit here on August 12th. The upshot of the conversation at which I also assisted was that Colonel Amin has promised to pass on the rist of our talks to the competent authority in Tehran. Colonel Amin himself knew nothing of the incident, and pointed out that as the alleged interference was by Customs officials the complaint would have to be dealt with by the Government Depart ment concerned. It was not the responsibility of the Naval Base. Both before and after the conversation, Captain Skelton, who has had some experience in these matters, made it clear to me that there was no evidence fro^ the correspondence that the goods in question had been illegally acquired. He said that the Nakhuda of Has al Khaimah was a notorious smuggler, and that the goods were quite likely to have been in this category. S.N.O.P.G. further stressed both the importance of our complete impartiality in the affair, and also that we should not assume that the Persian authorities were necessarily at fault in acting as they had done. Colonel Amin promised, when reporting to Tehran, to reouest the Persian authorities there to return the goods and money which had been confiscated, and to instruct the Customs authorities to avoid such incidents in future, without positive grounds for their justification.

The incidents referred to include the sinking and running aground of vessels during bad weather (and the subsequent repatriation of crews), the failure of vessels to arrive in ports, and the seizure of cargo. The file’s principal correspondents are the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Political Officer on the Trucial Coast.The most significant incidents referred to in the file (those constituting the most paperwork) are:an incident occurring in December 1945 in which the cargo vessel
                              Parisran aground near the RAF aerodrome at Jīwani near Gwādar, and subsequently had its cargo confiscated. Correspondence covers the incident, statements from the vessel’s nakhuda (Jasim bin Rashid bin Hamadeh) and owner (Haji Ali bin Moosa Al Omran), and the pursuit of a case by the vessel’s owner through the Court of Kalat State (ff 12-37, ff 44-52, f 55, f 58, ff 66-70, ff 76-80);an incident occurring in July 1946 concerning the disappearance of the
                              Samahan, a vessel carrying rice from Karachi to Marmagao, which was believed to have landed in a Persian Gulf port. The correspondence concerns efforts to trace the whereabouts of the vessels, its cargo and tindal (or native officer) (ff 59-61, f 65, ff 72-75, ff 84-93);incidents occurring in 1950 in which Iranian customs officials boarded vessels belonging to the Trucial Coast, and confiscated their cargo. The correspondence chiefly concerns the payment of compensation by the Iranian authorities to claimants from the Trucial Coast, via the British authorities at Tehran and Bahrain (ff 113-142, ff 145-154).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jīwani</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Seizure of property</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Repatriation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipwrecks</topic></subject><subject><topic>Compensation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Marine accidents</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00006c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
