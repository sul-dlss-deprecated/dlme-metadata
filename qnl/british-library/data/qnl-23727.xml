O rt The-undersigned'is directcid to invite a reference to the Memorandum from the Department of Industries and labour NOoA675 s dated the 10th August 1931, on the above subject in which the Departments of the Government of.India were requested to- take steps to curtail : their requirements for stationery and printing with a view to,reducing the expenditure of the Central 1 Stationery and Printing Department as a whole. The above instructions appear to have- led to an immediate reduction in expenditure; but during recent years the expenditure has again increased considerably. 2•'' In view of the imperative n&amp;ed for economy, the Economy Committee decided to impose a 15 per cent reduction in the monetary allotments for 1 stationery of all Central non-paying departments and offices subordinate thereto. The Government of India have accordingly reduced the V; 1 • :■ ■ j-.., grants to be placed at the disposal of the Controller of Printing and Stationeryj, India 9 during the financial year 1939-40. Indents placed on .the Central Stationery Office for articles of stationery 9 etc., for the ensuing year should, therefore, be prepared, with reference to the reduced allotments. 3. In regard to printing work, standard forms and publications it is not proposed to lay down any definite restriction as in the case of stationery. To secure the desiredf~\ -2- desired reduction in expenditure, however, it is essential for offices of the Government of India to co-operate in every possible manner. Departments and offices are accordingly requested to examine requisitions for printing work, standard forms and publications very carefully with a view to the elimination of all ^ unnecessary demands* In the matter of printing work in particular, appreciable economies could be achieved by a careful consideration at the outset whether printing cannot bt altogether avoided and, if inescapable, by a rigid adherence to the instructions contained in the Rules for Printing and Binding (c.f.rule 16 et sea ) in the matter of limiting author's corrections, the number of proofs and fair copies, etc., and especially in the, I reduction of 'Urgent* 'Immediate' and 'Timed* requisi tions to their minimum. The question of cutting stencils and using duplicated copies instead, wherever possible, should also be given due consideration before sending requisitions for printing to the Clearing Section of the office of the Controller of Printing and Stationery, India. % Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, To All •Non-paying 1 Departments of the Government of India (including the Central Board of Revenue, the Reforms Office, the Financial Adviser, Military Finance, and Finance / Officer, Communications.)-sr — rrmn GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

The attention of the Departments and Offices of the Oovernment of India is invited to the fact that owing to war conditions prevailing, at present, it is not easy, in fact it is not possible in some instances, to procure certain imported articles of stationery such as tracing cloth, D-O. note paper and envelopes, drawing paper, superior drawing pencils, drawing materials of all descriptions, imported nibs, etc., a list of which is enclosed for information.

In such cases suitable substitutes, if available , will be offered by the Central Stationery Office, Calcutta. It is needless to emphasise that economy in the use of these articles is imperative- Indenting Officers are, therefore, requested to co-operate 7 /ith this Department in restricting the use thereof by the curtailment of their demands, acceptance of indigenous articles in substitution, etc. They are also requested to refrain from demanding expensive- articles and to scrutinise their requirements very closely with a view to reducing them to the minimum. 2. In this connection attention is also invited to the Circular Memorandum from the Department of Labour, No.A354, dated the 9th September 1938, wherein the wider use of econoaiy slips was suggested. It is requested that a greater effort be made to use economy slips so as to effect a reduction in the use of envelopes.

In view of the imperative necessity for effecting economy in the use of paper in the present situation, the Government of India have decided to form a special paper economy organization and to appoint the Controller of Printing and Stationeryjlndia, as Paper Economy Officer in charge of that organization. This officer will deal with all questions of economy in the use of paper or connected with the supply of paper in Government offices and issue any orders he may think necessary from time to time. He will also pay periodical visits to the Departments of the Government of India Secretariat and their Attached and Subordinate offices with a view to seeing that the economy orders are being properly observed. The undersigned is directed to request that the fullest co-operation may be extended to the Paper Economy Officer in the discharge of his duties. 2° To avoid any delay in the introduction of paper economy measures till the organization referred to above begins to function, a copy of the instructions approved by this Department, in consulta tion with other Departments, is enclosed. The undersigned is to request that these instructions may be brought to the notice of all concerned and immediate effect given to them. The suggestions for further measures of economy made by some Departments are under separate consideration in consultation with the Paper Economy Officer. Sd/- 3. H.

Superintendents of offices should be responsible for the economic use of all stocks at present held. (ii) All notes - whether routine or regular - should be recorded on both sides of the note sheets. Letters should also be typed on both sides of the sheet except where the paper used is so thin as to make typing on both sides impracticable. ^ (iii) Double spaced typing should be avoided. All notes sjiould be typed with single spacing. Letters which are likely to extend to more than one page should also be typed with single spacing. (iv) (a) Paper of as few varieties as possible should be used. The use of Gream ; i /oves ? Cream Laids, A?ure Laids, Supercalendered papery ^ Manillas, etc., etc., should be restricted to the absolute minimum. Demands for Coloured Printings and Kraft paper should only be made in special circumstances. Brown wrapping should replace the use of Kraft. (b) The use of any kind of thick paper for correspondence should be avoided, and the smallest possible sheet consistent with the dignity and requirements of the communication should be used. (c) Drafts of letters should be kept as office copies and carbon copies should only be made where the draft has been so extensively altered as to make it necessary to have a clean copy. Whenever possible the carbon copy of a letter should be typed upon the back of the letter to which it is a reply, thus saving a sheet of copying paper and precluding any risk of the duplicate becoming detached from the original. (v) AH non-confidential correspondence delivered between departments in the same area should be sent loose and not in envelopes.

(vi) The Central Stationery Office at Calcutta should review the ^ demands made by Government of India Secretariat departments and offices over a period of 3 years, i.e. 1936-37, 1937-3S and 1938-39, and calculate the average of all paper items demaiided for these three years. They will then supply against future demands 20% less than the quantities so arrived at. Any issue above these quantities will require the sanction of the Controller of Printing and Stationery, India (Special Branch).^ (vii) At present items of stationery are issued monthly on the basis of model indents appearing in Appendix F to the Stationery i^ules. In future each clerk should be asked to put down his actual requirements every month or at stated intervals in the form intended for the purpose and the Superintendent of the Branch should satisfy; himself that the demands are justified before their issue is authorised. Stationery items, particularly items of paper, should on no account be entrusted to the care of Record Suppliers, Duftries, menials, etc., or issued by them on request. The work should be entrusted to an official not below the rank of a senior clerk. Superintendents should be responsible for this procedure. (viii) whenever possible buff coloured paoer, should be used in preference to white. White paper takes longer to manufacture.

Whilst every effort to economise should be made Experience shows that the use of half sheets of flimsy typing paper for letters which must be maintained for a period of years on record is impracticable owing to the difficulty of securely fastening such sheets to the files. Correspondence there fore which must be kept on record for a period of years should in future be written on full sheets of paper. In order to avoid a possible shortage in typing paper offices should buy in now at least one year*s stock, if they have not already done so. By order.

It has been noticed in several instances that such certificates are furnished by thecfipartments and Offices 9n separate sheets of paper instead of being incorporated in the requisition or indent form itself. This practice is wasteful and should be avoided. The certificate should be given in the requisition of indent form itself. If there is hot sufficient space to give them on the printed side of the rec uisition or indent , the blank side of such requisition or indent may be utilised for the purpose. 3 In Ihis connection attention is invited to the follow ing points also;- (i) here is no need for a forwarding letter to accompany the requisition or indent. Any remarks intended for this office or the Press ray be nven on Lne^requisition or indent. (ii) In several cases instructions for the Iress are ginenon separate sheets of parer and attached to he requisition or indent. Sucn instructions should be riven on the blank side of the requisition or indent as far as possible,. v&lt; (iii) Requisition form S.99-A, for printing saleable rublications (vide rule 14 and rules 32- of the Rules for Printing and Binding, 1935 edition) contains a 'duplicate' portion which is intended for the Central Publication Branch.
