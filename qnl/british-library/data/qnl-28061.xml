Mr Muntz who is a Director of Air Y/orks Limited,_ Indianc4 T ational Airways Limited, and ia essrs. Misr Air Corporat4.(A / ga lled ] to see me this morning, He said that he had come Tor ’tiie ’purpose of endeavouring to interest the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited in running an air service for their own business. He emphasised that his concern was entirely British and stated that he hoped to put British airways ahead of foreign competitors. He stated further that he was in close consulataon with Air Marshal Sir Keith Park and that he would be granted adequate facilities by the Royal Air Force both in the provision of spare parts and in the use of landing grounds. 2. I said I could not understand why the Oil Company should vfish to use aircraft and I said 1 thought that the Arabian American Oil Company on the mainland might be interested and possibly Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited who had certain concessions on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. I made it quite clear that without referring to my records I could not in form him what, the Political reaction would be should he desire to start operations and how his company would be affected by the various agreements between His Majesty's Government and His Highness the Shaikh. Mr Muntz said that the question of agreements would have to be dealt with by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited if they were interested. 3. It seems that in 1940 Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton of the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited was interested in starting a local air service but from a conversation which I had two evenings ago with Mr. Hamilton I am inclined to think that the interest has v/aned. However Mr. Muntz has promised to see me again tomorrow and will inform me of the result of the conversation which he hopes to hold with the Gil Company Manager this afternoon. 4. On the morning of the 18th Mr. Muntz informed me that his conversations with Hr. Hamilton and Mr. Anderson of the Bahrain Petroleum Com any Limited had convinced him that the Company were not interested in an air service. In answer to my enquiry about the American Arabian Oil Company he said that he had discovered that owing to the absence of Mr. Ohliger the General Manager it would be necessary for him to visit the United States if he desired to contact their Directors.
