Kemball reports the the Wahhabi forces were preparing to march on the Imam of Muscat's territories when the threatened defection of sheikh Saeed bin Tahnoon (Sa'id bin Tahnun) of Abu Dhabi caused him to postpone his plans and accept mediation.Kemball's letter includes two enclosures:1. A translation of a letter (folio 124) from Sultan bin Suggar [Sultan bin Saqr], Joasmee [Qasimi] chief, to Kemball, dated 6 April 1853;2.
