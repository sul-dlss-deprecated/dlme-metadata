Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) U. Fawcett. J.T.i). Greenway, hs^.. Foreign Office,Whitehall 8100 14th March, 1933. Importation. Gentlemen, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, reference T/LLl/14, regarding your explosives for expert to Afghanistan, and note that it is your intention to manufacture new consignments of Blasting Gelatine and Dynamite. In this connection I should be glad to hear from you as to when manufacture will be completed so that further samples could be taken and submitted to tests by our Chemical advisers. At the present time your Baelenite is in bond with the two explosives which have not given satisfactory results and it is assumed therefore that you wish to release the Blasting Gelatine and Dynamite III for you may have immediate use for this explosive in Belgium. I mention this, because although these two explosives are not considered suitable for authorisation in this country, it may be that they will pass all the necessary tests of your own authorities for immediate use in Belgium. In this connection I wish to impress on you therefore not to interfere in any way with the explosives which have been sealed by me until such time as I return. Regarding the prolonged examination to which I referred in my letter of the 7th instant, this consists of a six weeks storage at 90°F, one sample being in a water saturated atmosphere and the other in a dry atmosphere and after this further heat tests are carried out to see if there has been any deterioration. However, it would appear that as you have now decided to manufacture new supplies of Blasting Gelatine and Dynamite III there ar _ „ would/ Messrs.x°udreriesR|unies de Belgioue S.A. a7 a , Boulevard du jardin Botanioue ^ BRUXRLL3B.would be no point in carrying out this prolonged examination which will taxe six weeks and also is rather expensive. In your letter you refer to the authorisation of Baelenite. It has occurred to me that you have possibly misunderstood my letter of the 7th instant in which I stated I was prepared to give a certificate to the effect that the Baelenite in question would be considered suitable for inclusion in the list of Authorised Explosives. The object of granting such a certificate is for the benefit of the Indian authorities, v/ho would, no doubt, on receipt of such information be prepared to allow the transit of your explosives from Karachi to Afghanistan. There would be no purpose served in having it placed on the Authorised List unless you do at some future date contemplate importing these explosives into Britain. If such were the case then further fees would be payable and I am sure that it is not now your intention to find a market for this explosive in this country. Regarding the visit of your representative to see tests carried out by our Chemical Advisers, I will en deavour to make arrangements for such a visit. There are difficulties in the way, but it is considered that after you have manufactured your new supplies of Blasting Gelatine and Dynamite III, samples ahoiId be taken by me and your representative could return to England with me to see how the tests are carried out. It is hoped that the various points I have raised in this letter are all perfectly clear, if not, I shall only be too pleased to try and elaborate them. I am, etc., (Sgd.) N.Fawcett. Captain, ^ H.M. Inspector of Explosives. r\copy (N 1557/185/97) HOME OFFICE S.W.l 13 3 3 7th March, 1933 Dear Greenway, With further reference to your letter N 545/185/97 of the 30th January last, the position regarding the explosives for export to Afghanistan is now as follows. On the 24th February last I proceeded to Belgium and re ported to Messrs. Poudreries Rdunies de Belgique S.A. on the morning of the 25th February. A consultation took place in their offices, and as a result of this it was decided that I should proceed to their factory at Baelen on the morning of the 27th February. On arrival at the factory I found all the explosives were packed and ready for shipment. f The explosives consisted of 883 cases, each packed with 50 lbs. The cases were numbered consecutively and the contents were as follows:- Nos. 1 - 530 Baelenite. Total 12,000 kilos. ' 531 - 839 Blasting Gelatine 700 kilos. M 840 - 883 Dynamite III 1,000 kilos. The following samples were taken:- Baelenite. One sample of each from cases Nos. 7, 23, 134, 261, 383 and 412. Blasting Gelatine . One sample of each from cases numbered 576, 600, 680, 700, Dynamite III One sample of cases numbered 854 and 876. These samples were packed for me by the firm in waterproof packages, and I conveyed them to Woolwich for examination by our Chemical Advisers. The results of the examination were as 808 and 829 follows: J.T.D.Greenway, Esq., FOREIGN OFFICE.# follows:- Blasting Gelatine. Nitro-glycerine Nitro-cotton Moisture 91.015? 8.32# .67# Baelenite Nitro-glycerine and T.N.T.

Six samples. 10-^,8,12,9,7,16 minutes respectively. Dynamite III Two samples 7 and 8 minutes respectively. * I In accordance with the above-mentioned Memorandum the minimum text figure for Nitro-Baelenite is 7 minutes, and that lor Blasting Gelatine and Dynamite III 10 minutes , and it will be seen from the above figures that Nitro-Baelenite is the only one to pass the test. I would also mention that the cases which were opened by me were packed in accordance with the Order of Secretary ol State No.7 made under Sections 33, 39 and 40 of the Explosives Act, 1875. A certificate was also obtained from the firm to the ellect that there were no ingredients in the explosive which would in any way affect the tests as carried out by our Chemical Advisers. A copy of this certificate is attached. The question of the sealing of the bul&amp; oi the explosives had to be considered, and at first it was my intention to seal each case, tut after consultation with the firm it was considered that anyany sealing which may he done would possibly he destroyed in transit, and I accordingly suggested that a magazine for the storage of this explosive should he placed at my disposal. This the firm were only too ready to do, and I therefore had all the explosives transferred to one magazine, which magazine was then locked and sealed hy me. I have sent the following telegram to the firm:- 'Baelenite passed tests. Blasting Gelatine and Dynamite III failed. Letter follows”. A copy of the letter which has also heen sent is attached. I would suggest that this information he passed on to Mr. Donaldson of the India Office, who has heen in touch with this subject during the last few months. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) N. Fawcett.—COPY Whitehall 8100 HOME OFFICE Foreign Visits WHITEHALL, S.V.l 7th March, 1933 G-ent 1 erne n, I beg to confirm the following telegram which was sent to yon to-day:- 'Baelenite passed tests.

The above results show a great irregularity, and this possibly points to insufficient purification of the ingredients of the compositions, or possibly to the quality of the nitro-glycerine used. For Hitro-Baelenite the minimum test figure is 7 minutes, and for Blasting Gelatine and Dynamite III the figure is lo minutes. These times are in accordance with the above- mentioned memorandum. Should you so desire it a prolonged examination of the two explosives which failed the heat test could be carried out, and it is just possible that after such a prolonged examination these explosives may be released and considered suitable for export. The fees lor such prolonged examination would be £25. 4s. Od. for each sample, but I would add that this examination would take at least six weeks. Although Baelenite has passed the heat test I would mention that the various samples gave very irregular results, and it is possible owing to the small percentage of nitro glycerine present in this explosive that this is the explanationexplanation as to why it passed* As a result of these tests I am prepared to give a certificate to the eiiect that Baelenite has passed the British heat tests, and would he considered suitable for inclusion in the List of Authorised Explosives.

Dear Donaldson, With reference to our telephone conversation regarding the purchase of Blasting Gelatine 92jl (7000 kilos) and Baelenite (12000 kilos) by the Afghans from the Poudreries Reunies de Belgique S.A., which will be consiged to Karachi and travel through a part of India to Afghanistan, I understand that if an explosive is on the Authorised List of Explosives published in this country then no objection to this importation would be raised in India, out if the explosive is not of British manufacture and it is exported from the United Kingdom and is covered by a certificate granted by one of H.M. Inspectors of Explosives in the United Kingdom showing that it has passed the United Kingdom tests, then such explosive would be allowed to be imported into India. I gather from our conversation yesterday that it is desired that the latter procedure be adopted, and that you are anxious to assist the Afghans in this matter. If such is the case then we should require a 4 oz. sample of the Blasting Gelatine 92Ji and the Baelenite for examination by our Chemical Advisers. The fee for this examination would be £6.6.0. in respect of each sample. In addition to this we should require to be informed of the exact composition of both of these explosives, and it should be made clear to the suppliers that the samples should be representative of the bulk consignment which was being supplied to the Afghans. ^he examination of these samples would take about six weeks, and if they are successful in passing our tests I would point out that they would then be eligible to be placed on the Authorised List E.P. Donaldson,Esq India Office, S.W.l. /orof Explosives for this country, and that the tests to which they conditions which exist in this country, and would not, therefore, represent the conditions which exist in India. If these two explosives pass the necessary test for the British Authorised List we could then inform you to this effect, and supply you with a definition with which the explosives would have to comply. The bulk consignment could then be forwarded to this country to some convenient port in which explosives are allowed to be imported, when representative samples should be taken by the Customs and forwarded to this Office for examination by our Chemical Advisers in order to ascertain that the bulk consignment complied with our requirements. The examination of these samples would take approximately three days, but I fear we should have to charge a consultation fee of £1.1.0. in respect of each sample in order to cover the cost of examination. I enclose a list of ports into which explosives are allowed to be brougnt into this country for your information. I assume that in all probability the explosive will be brought into the Thames, in which case some arrangement will have to be made with the Port of London Authority, either for the explosive to be kept in the ship in which it is imported or for the explosive to be trans-shipped either into licensed barges or possibly into the floating magazines situated in the mouth of the Thames belonging to Messrs. Wood &amp; Company, Denton Wharf, Gravesend. Some suitable arrange ments will have to be made in advance for the proper storage of the consignment for the three days^which it will have to be kept in this country pending the examination of the samples. In the case of the importation of the two 4 oz. samples and also of ths bulk consignment, if the explosive is authorised^an importation licence under the Explosives Act, 1875, should be taken out for which a fee of £2 for every 2000 lbs or part of 2000 lbs is payable, but, under Section 97 of the Act, if a Government Department will take control of the explosive the provisions of the Act would not /apply -3. apply. I understand that it is your wish to take control of this explosive, in which case it would be necessary for you to inform the Secretary of the Customs in London, and at the same time intimate to him the port at which the explosive is likely to arrive, and the date on which it will arrive so that he may communicate with the Customs Officers at the port of entry. If the samples submitted are found to be satisfactory the explosive will not be placed on the Authorised List of Explosives as no importation licence will be taken out, but we can give you a statement to the effect that the explosives have passed the necessary tests for authorisation. I must make it quite clear that the 4 oz. samples of explosive submitted must be representative of the bulk consignment; as I said this morning, the Company from whom the Afghans are purchasing this material have agents in this country, and I may say, in confidence, that in the past this Company have been found to vary the ingredients in their explosives without informing us. I am afraid that this letter is rather involved, but I have tried to let you know as far as possible the various steps which have to be taken in order to avoid any misunder standing or unnecessary delay in dealing with this matter. In the event of this method of procedure being adopted we should be glad to have early notice of when the samples and the consignment are due to arrive in this country, so that we can make the necessary arrangements for the examination to be carried out as expeditiously as possible. With regard to the question of key industry duty, as this consignment would be a trans-shipment no payment would be required in this direction. I cannot help thinking that it would be much simpler for the Afghans if the explosives were purchased in this country.

Your Highn«88 # With reference to the loyal Afghan Legation^ memorandum of the 3rci October f regarding the transit through India to Afghanistan of certain explosives Imported from Belgium f 1 have the honour to state that, if such explosives are sent to a British port for testing purposes snd, as a result of such testing, are covered by a certificate from a British Inspector they eill be alloeed to enter India, subject to the special rules applicable at Karachi, in anticipation of the grant of a licence. Otherwise they will be liable to inspection and testing at .frrachi. 2. X enclose, for Your Highness 1 Information, a copy of the special rules for the transit of explosives within the Port of Karachi, which apply to all vessels carrying such goods, whether or not the goods are covered by a licence. 3. I shall be glad if I n»y be informed in due course by what vessel the consignment Is being shipped, so that the Commissioner In Sind my issue his licence as soon as the explosives are discharged at Jiraehl. I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration. Your highness V obedient servant, (For the secretary of State) Bis Highness Ahmed All Khan, etc., etc., etc*P.Z. 6189/32. K Minute Paper. % Department. I think it is clear that the explosives mentioned in the enclosure to the Afghan Legation Note of 3rd October are the same as those for which the Afghan Legation in Paris have asked for facilities on papers P.Z. 3436/32, and the enclosure is in the form which is required by the Indian authorities for the issue of an import licence - see enclosure to Foreign Office despatch to Paris of 27th July. As regards M. Haidar's request that they should be examined by a British Government Inspector in Belgium or in a British port, I think that there would be no difficulty in arranging this in a U.K. port, but probably the expense of sending the inspector over to Antwerpespecially for the purpose might prove to be prohibitive. This procedure would obviate the difficulty of inspection at Karachi, to which the Afghans object on the ground that it would involve unpacking the goods and repacking them on the Port Trust hulk. It would not, hov/ever, get over the necessity for the vessel which carries the explosives discharging them at the Explosives moorings and not at the ordinary dock, since the rules governing the transport of explosives within the Port of Karachi apply to all vessels carrying such goods, whether or not the)^ are covered by a licence. I understand that it is quite a usual procedure, which is applied in most ports, including the Port of London, where vessels are required to discharge dangerous cargo at a special floating magazine, from which they are later conveyed by a lighter to the place from which they are transferred to the railway. A copy of the rules applicable to the Port/ 4^i-i tr.: Port of Karachi is attached. I would therefore suggest that the Afghan Legation might be informed that, if they are prepared to arrange for their explosives to be sent for examination to a British port to be tested, s«4- ii they are covered a certificate from a British inspector, they- will be allowed to enter India, subject to the special rules t • • • V • applicable at Karachi, in anticipation of the grant of^a^_ licence. Otherwise, they will be liable to inspection/at Karachi. We should then ask the Afghan Legation to let us know by what vessel the consignment is being ' .. shipped, so that the Commissioner in Sind may issue his licence as soon as the explosives have been ^ 4F r Lh”«&lt; fyj- .

Meanwhile, a copy of the Afghan Legation’s Note and its enclosure has been sent to India by airmail. )/v^&lt; Northern PnreiA Office V^/Special rules for the transport of explosive within the Port of Karachi. In exercise of the powers conferred by section 5 of the Indian Explosives Act, 1884 (IV of 1834), and in supersession of all previous notifications issued by the Government of Bombay on the same subject, the Governor in Council, with the previous sanction of the Governor General in Council, is pleased to make the following special rules for the transport of explosives other than those mentioned in section 14 of the said Act in the Port of Karachi, namely:- 1.

The master of any sea-going vessel or boat, when discharging or receiving explosives, shall have the platform ii the vessels hold, the gangways and combing of the hatchways covered eith tanned hides or other suitable paddings and shall see that no person uses anything made of iron or steel in connection with cases containing explosives. No boats shall be used for the conveyance or deposit of explosives excepting decked boats, approved by the Port Officer, with closed hatches under lock and key during such time that they shall have explosives on board, and shall exhibit on a board or otherwise the word '’Explosives’ painted in ^hite letters a foot long on a black ground on each side above the water line and keep a red flag hoisted during the day and a red light at night. 10.

Haidar, the First Secretary of the Afghan Legation, who left this note with me, that these were the same explosives. M. Haidar said that he was instructed to ask whether the Government of India would not allow them to be examined by British Government ex perts, or aiy others they might choose, either in Belgium or in a British port, as there was no question of their being used in India, and the climatic danger date (September 30th) was new past. I gathered that the objection to examination at Karachi was that once the explosives were packed it was very difficult to unpack them for testing, and still more difficult and expensive to have them removed to the 'port trust hulk' pending the issue of an import licence. I merely told M. Haidar that I would see what could be done; but I confess that I do not understand why the explosives must in any case be removed to the hulk (see N 4907/82/97); and I should be inclined, subject to the views of the I.O., to press the Government of India to let the explosives be tested in Belgium and shipped straight through at Karachi without this cumbersome and expensive procedure. So long as they go straight through to Afghanistan and have been tested, the Government of India ought to be satisfied. (signed) R.G.

Later correspondence (1934-1935) concerns material ordered from the Swedish firm AB Bofors Nobelkrut (folios 15-20).The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
