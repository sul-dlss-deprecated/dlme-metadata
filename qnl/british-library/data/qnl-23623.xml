Later however he applied verbally to my predecessor for a vehicle who recommended that a permit be issued in his favour for a 15 cwt truck* This recommendation however was not accepted as presumably the correspondence relating to the Trucial Coast quo had been closed and also this office had stressed the unsuitability of 15 cwt trucks. 3. • sometime lac,er an Inspector of the Indian post and Telegraphs Department visited Sharjah on a tour of inspection and Khan Sahib Husain represented his difficulties to him regarding transport and his need for a new vehicle. It appears that he gave the Khan Sahib to understand that he would try to obtain a permit for him officially through his department and that is why the Khan Sahib has applied for one to the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Sindh and Baluchistan Circle. 4. Khan sahib still stands in need of a car as at present he only possesses an old and unreliable Eord pick-up and experiences great difficulty in fulfilling the terms of his mail contract. From the Director's letter it would appear that the post and Telegraphs Department might be prepared to arrange the issue of an export permit for him if we explain the reason why his application to us was turned down and certify that he really needs a new car for the purpose of fulfilling the terms of his mail contract. Unless therefore there is any chance of obtaining a vehicle for him under the Trucial Coast quota I would suggest that we reply to the Director of posts ana Telegraphs, Sindh and Baluchistan accordingly. The Khan Sahib requires a Ford pick-up or a station wagon or a truck of any description, er in ttot order of preference. political Officer, Trucral Coast, ^ Sharjah. 6 ^ Off.&lt;0.3084-14/5.
