As Your Lordship has doubtless been informed Petroleum Developments Western Arabia Limited have decided to terminate operations in Western Arabia and have bo notified the Saudi Arabian Government. 2 . The Acting 1 inister for Foreign Affairs called on me today to tell me on Ibn Baud’s instructions that the Saudi Arabian Government had not yet acknowledged receipt of the notification. Ibn aud was most distressed and hoped thf*t the Company would reverse their decision. He was placed in a very awkward position for the Italians had long been badgering him for a concession and if the Petroleum Developments Western agency gave up he did not see how he could refuse to allow the Italians to take over. I said that th° reason why the Company were giving up was I understood that there was no oil and perhaps the Italians would not want the concesei m after all. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Italians were not interested in the oil but in gaining a footing in the country and Ibn Saud did not want them. The King had instructed him to tell me that it was very much in the interests both of His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia that the Petroleum Developments Western /O'abia should not abandon their concession at least for the duration of the war. He earnestly begs His Majesty’s Government to intervene with the Company. v hh ,4a</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00033c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/377</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00033c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/377</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 2582/40 'Anglo-Saudi relations: desire of Petroleum Concessions Western Arabia to cease operations: Ibn Saud's desire for them to continue to prevent Italian takeover'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1940/1940</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-17T11:19:20</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (2 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 4; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains a telegram from Hugh Stonehewer Bird, British Minister at Jedda to the Foreign Office concerning the reactions of the Saudi Arabian government following the decision of Petroleum Developments Western Arabia Limited to terminate operations in Western Arabia.The telegram also refers to the concerns of Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] regarding a possible Italian takeover in Hedjaz and Ibn Saud's desire for the British government to intervene.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) Ltd.</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Hedjaz</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00033c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
