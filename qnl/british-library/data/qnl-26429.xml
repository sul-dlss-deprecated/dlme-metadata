The Ministry of Foreign Affairs present their conpliments to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad, and have the honour to state that the Administration of the Iraqi Airways desires to run a scheduled air service for the transport of passengers, freight and mails from Iraq to Karachi, via Bahrain and Sharja* The Ministry, therefore, request the esteemed Embassy to be so good as to intervene with the competent quarters in India with a view to obtaining the necessary permission for the purpose of taking the said cargo from Iraq, Bahrain and Sharja to Karachi, and also from Karachi to Iraq, Bahrain and Sharja. It is probable that the said air service will be run twice weekly. The Ministry will furnish the esteemed Embassy in due course with the necessary details concerning tlie date of conrnencement of the said service and the type to the aeroplane to be used in this service. In awaiting a reply, the Ministry avail themselves of the opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem.

Both ambulance and fire engine could be sent to the aerodrome in an emergency on telephonic instructions from the aerodrome authorities. This, however, cannot be regarded as a satisfactory substitute as the aerodrome is on the island of Muharraq and the ambulance and fire engines on the island of Manama and it would take some time for either to reach the aerodrome.

I regret that it is hardly possible for me to collect information asked foO? under (a) and (b) in paragraph 2 before my visit to Delhi. The actual air strips at Bahrain and Sharjah will as far as I know continue to be maintained by the R.A.F. and at Kuwait by the Kuwait Oil Company. What is required is proper ground organisation for a scheduled air service and the Government of India's Directorate of Civil Aviation are, I would suggest, in a better position to provide an approximate estimate of the cost of such ground organisation than I am. Best course would probably be for a representative of the Directorate of Civil Aviation or of the company which proposes to maintain an air service to visit Bahrain and Sharjah and ascertain exactly what is required. My latest information regarding Sharjah is that B.O.A.C. propose to continue to occupy fort and I presume therefore they will provide necessary ground organisation. 3. With regard to landing charges only service at present projected at Bahrain and Sharjah is the Indian service and Directorate of Civil Aviation should be able to estimate landing charges leviable in relation to the type of aircraft used. At Kuwait Iraqi Airways are contemplating a service three times a week c.f. correspondence ending with my telegram No.549 May 2nd but I do not know the type of aircraft they^ffropose use. 4.

B.O.A.C. said last year that they would have no future requirements for Sharjah. In spite of rumours to the conurary ^hey are still maintaining wireless station in the fort at Sharjah. This 3.O.A.C. station in the past carried a certain amount of commercial wireless traffic between Sharjah and Bahrein. In March Cable &amp; Wireless, nearing that B.O.a.C. would be withdrawing from Sharjaii, /suggestedsuggested that they might operate the necessary wireless • faoili.t^c #*m Sharjali themselves. The posit ion thus reouires elucidation at the meeting.

The R.A.P. also stated tnat they vrere aoandoning the accomnodation of the airfield usea for passengers in trainsit and were handing it over to Aramco (I think Air Ministry will tell us that this is incorrect;. The Political Resident pointed out that without ary of these facilities it would he doubtful whether scheduled land services stopping at Bahrein ought to he authorised. Here again the position needs elucidation. Koweit ■ . , . The aerodrome here has not heen regularly used for civil aviation. The R.-u.P. used it ‘SaS? last year when they withdrew and the Koweit Oil Company then agreed to maintain it for so long as it-was used by A.I.O.C, aeroplanes and casual visiting aircraft. The responsibility for this aerodrome belongs to H.A.G-. since under their agreement with the Sheikh he granted them exclusive rights to establish and maintain as his agents aerodromes in Koweit territory. If therefore Irani Airways (and Air India) are to run a service to Koweit, H.M.CA have' the responsibility of seeing that there are proper aerodrome facilities. The Koweit Oil Go. are apparently willing to maintain two out Df the four present air strips for light aircraft only-but are not /willing pn'i.willing to undertake management. Signals arrangements for aircraft are practically non-existent at present (see paragraphs 26 and 27 of the 7 elec omnium cat i ons Attache's report belcrw,). It is for the l.linistry of Civil Aviation to aHvise what the future arrangements for Koweit should 'be and on this depends the answer to Iraqi Airway^ application.4- i 1 • j r I i-iUU UMss/m/ti « !.*■ £3BB '^U'XS^ '^' . 9fi ^' [The text of this telegram must first be paraphrased if communioeted to persons outside British G-overnment service or if transmitted in a cypher system other than O.T.P. ] Cypher DSPARTIIENm NO. 1 FROIi BiiGDiD TO BMRBIN Sir H.

It is now difficult to estimate number of seats we could definitely fill each week from Basra to Karachi as in the present absence of any allocation to us, passengers are no longer approaching us apart from Government of India officials and occasional business men. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. has been asked to state their requirements which are thought to be about two seats per week. 2. We feel we coUld easily fill three seats per week as when the public learns of a definite allocation they will again approach us. Seats not filled could be released to Bagdad who it is understood have a greater demand. 3. The situation will change when the proposed Tata Airline Service Karachi/Bagdad commences and also the reciprocal services between India and Persia now under final discussion.UiAl**.** ,1 i . nward te(!eg(Cam S'* |i ' t v«. to** (If -n any case the co munication df^the cc^t^nts^of tl.is document to any person outsihdl British c Oovernment Service is authorised paraphrased) ■:k t mu o » flatted ,to_B 2 ^ £ n^,D S partoag WM ' 9 ^ My opies to: Perm.

Since receipt of the above-quoted letter, I have also received your letter of the 8th May (Ext. 9Q3/h-l) ? which to some extent covers the same point, and also deals with the position at Sharjah and Bahrein. I agree that the position is getting somewhat involved, and that there would be every advantage in having a meeting on the subject, which presunably the India Office would call. We would be very glad to be represented if you can give us a few days' notice. The issues, so far as we are concerned, affect one or two different branches, including Finance, so we v/ould have to get a team together. F.A.K.

Particular attention is given to conditions at the Koweit aerodrome, which is maintained by the Kuwait Oil Company. Towards the front of the file is a small amount of correspondence related to a request from Syrian Airways to land at Koweit.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Ambassador to Iraq (Sir Hugh Stonehewer Bird), the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (William Rupert Hay and Arnold Crawshaw Galloway), officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and officials of the India Office (the Commonwealth Relations Office from August 1947).The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
