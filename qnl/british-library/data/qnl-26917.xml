I approached the Sultan of Muscat on the subject of Galloway becoming his Y/azir when I saw him in Karachi, and gave him a rough estimate of what this would cost him. With pension and foreign service contributions etc. this came to about Rs.3000/- a month. After some days* reflection His Highness replied that he wbuld like to have obtained Galloway*s services, but that these would prove rather expensive: Byard’s pay etc. came to under Rs.1500/- per month. His Highness sent on to say that he would like to wait until the end of the year, which is also the end of the Muscat financial year, find then see how his finances stood, when he would let us have a reply. 4. My own idea is that he will probably abandon the idea of the Wazir now that his foreign relations have been put on a satisfactory basis with us by the new Treaty, and will tend to turn, unofficially at all events, to the Political Agent for such advice as he may need. 5. With regard to Byard. I again gave it as my opinion to His Highness that Byard seemed to me most suitable, both for looking after the Levies and for any other duties that His Highness might like to give hdm, though of course it was for His Highness to make any decision he thought fit. His Highness said that he had consider ed the matter carefully and made up his mind to dispense with Byard*s services with effect from about August of this year, giving him six months leave to which he was entitled under his contract. I suggested to His Higiiness that, as he was going to have no British Officer at Muscat to look after the Levy, he might do well to get from India a really good Indian officer on the active list to command the Corps. The present Indian officers of the Corps are2 . all retired. The point of my suggestion is that while these retired officers do sufficiently well when they have a British officer to k&amp;.ep them up to the mark, I do not think that a retired officer would 1 a success in sole command. At one time before Byard took over the Ci *ps, it was commanded by a retired Indian officer, and the results were far/^ from satisfactory. His Highness welcomed this suggestion. * I am sending a copy of this letter to Watts, who will take up with the Sultan the Question of the Indian officer. Yours sincerely Sd/- T.G.

'J^ct t. y 6. I am delighted that the Sultan of Muscat should have proved so great a success; and I am sure that the very strenuous programme which you describe ana the care which has clearly been taken to pay him honour will have produced an excellent effect. I only wish at the moment that I could see more prospect of finding for him the British Adviser whom he is so anxious to obtain. I am most strongly myself in favour of this, but Metcalfe tello me that he sees great difficulty in finding a man from the Department; and much as I would myself like to see in States such as Muscat and Kcweit someone on the lines of the Sheikh of Bahrein’s adviser, accounts of whom are most encouraging, the supply of men of that type and quality is clearly limited to a degree. I will speak again to Metcalfe as to the possibility of finding a man, and will do what I can tohelp in that way. I am sure that it is quite definitely to our advantage not only to respond to appeals of this type, but to help a young Ruler with intelligence, initiative, and, I would judge, independence of character, such as the Sultan, with the best material we can as an insurance against the future; and I amconfirmed in that view by the telegrams which I see passing as regards Italian activities in the Muscat area; by the possibility that there may be oil develop ments in his State of material importance, and by the interest which the Sultan in conversation with .me clearly showed in re-establishing himself in the hinterland of his Dominions, and in the position at Baraimi. I am sure in that connection that we cannot much longer avoid some arrangement for representation on the Trucial coast which would at a pinch enable us to link up through Baraimi with the Muscat State, though I am quite prepared to accept that it might be wiser for us in the first instance to avoid the formal appointment of a Political Agent on the Trueial Coast, ana to arrange instead merely for visits of growing length and frequency by an iirab speaking political officer, i^ut the other development is bound to come, ana I am pro foundly impressed by the unsatisfactory nature of the present arrangement under which we have no political officer in that area, and by the risk that for political intelligence, frequently of material value, we may find ourselves increasingly dependent on the oil companies and their friends.EXTRACT froirj private letter from Lord Zetland to Lord Linlithgow, dated 5th April 1938. 11. The Sultan of Muscat reached this country at the beginning of last week, and I presided at a Government Banquet in his honour on March 29th. I found him a pleasant and intelligent person who is quite clearly very well disposed towards this country. /i»e have drawn up a full and varied programme for his education and entertainment during the fortnight that he is a guest of the Government, including a day's horse-racing, visits to various theatres and a visit to a country house where he is to inspect a pack of fox-hounds. The more serious side of the programme includes visits to hospitals and various other institutions, including, of course, flying schools and other military shows. He was received by the King last week and invested with the K.C.I.E. His only complaint so far is, I believe, that the programme is so full that it leaves little time for shopping.’^ ~ New Delhi t the 24th Larch 1938. j V*ould you please refer to my confidential demi-official letter No.j? 1 •549-11/37, dated the 8th February regarding certain problems pending with the Sultan of Muscat. You will have received a copy of Towle’s demi-official letter No.C/136 of the 3rd ^arch, which, read with uy letter of the 3th February, to which it is a reply, gives you so .e idea of our views on the quest ions raised in your demi-official letter Uo.P.Z.3203/37 of the 15th January. ^s hov/ever I have not yet sent a formal reply to that letter, I will attempt do so now dea-iing with it paragraph by paragraph. 2. Viith the views which you expressed in paragraph 2, the Government of India are in complete agreement and as I have indi cated before, His Excellency takes a considerable personal interest in the development and maintenance of close relations with .luseat. 3. as regards the projected visit of His Highness to Italy, we think in agreement with Fowle that it would neither be desira ble nor practicable to attempt to dissuade the Sultan from carrying out this visit, if he wishes to do so. From what I saw of him in India, I should think that he has a great deal of determination and that opposition on a point of this kind might only harden his resolve as well as arousing his suspicions. 4. In paragraph 4 you mentioned two matters: (a) the provision of the services of a British Officer as Political adviser. Some copies of correspondence with Fowle on the subject were sent to you under cover of my weekly letter No.26(A)M., dated the 5th March and you will have since received a copy of Fowls*s demi-official letter No.167-8. of the 10th .larch in which he has suggested the possibility of utilizing Galloway for this appointment. I enclose herewith a copy of the reply which I am sending to Fowle and should be grateful if you v/ill let him have a copy on arrival in i«ondon. in- 2 - in case it misses him at Bahrain. As you will see there is no possibility of providing the Sultan with an officer immediately, since we have no one to spare. We are all (with the exception of the Sultan) agreed that Breianer would not be a suitable selection, but there may of course be difficulty in persuading His Highness to accept any other officer. In the last resort his objections might perhaps be overcome, if v^e or His Majesty’s Govt, are prepared to offer Galloway or some other suitable officer on terms which are financially favourable to the Sultan. This latter idea has not however yet been considered and I hope that it may not arise. (b) The question of the Arms Traffic Subsidy. You suggest that the Sultan should be informed during his visit to London, if he raises the question, that the matter is al ready under the consideration of the Government of India. As you will remember the present position is that the Sultan was told by me in Delhi that if he made an application for restora^- tion of the subsidy through the Political Resident it would be considered. I have just received Powie’s demi-official letter Ho.204-S. of l/th .larch of which a copy has gone to you. In this is enclosed a copy of a letter from His Highness to ^atts dated the 20th Hovr. 1937 asking for restoration mainly on the ground of the financial necessities of the State, tfowle does not regard finance as a valid argument for restoration and thinks that it could only be justified if the Sultan agrees to give us considerably more control over him and his State, than we at present exercise, as Fowle says this will be a difficult matter and the v/hole question will of course require careful consideration and consultation bet- v/een His Majesty*s Govt, and the Government of India. One issue will certainly be raised, viz., by whom the subsidy is to be paid, if it is eventually decided to restore it. I have not yet had time to take the Viceroy f s instructions or to consult other Departments but I feel quite sure that the Government of India will take the strongest objection to acceptingr*v -3- accepting responsibility for any part of the payment even though they may agree that restoration is desirable. Unless therefore His Jajesty f s Govt, are prepared to accept full responsibility for this annual lakh of rupees, in case it is decided to restore the subsidy, it is obviously necessary to avoid at present giving His Highness any reason to believe that the subsidy will be restored or cause to reproach us with breach of faith, if the decision is ultimately unfavourable. On the other hand it would be correct now to say that the matter is under consideration and we should have no objection to the Sultan being so informed, if he raises the matter, pro vided you make it clear (a) that the matter is one which concerns not only the Government of India but also His Majesty^ Govt, (b) that no decision has yet been taken. 5. Paragraph 5 of your letter was concerned with arrange ments for Powle and Vatts to go to London for the Sultan’s visit. This has now been settled after some rather con fusing telegraphic correspondence. I am sorry about the muddle over latts. be had heard nothing here of the expedi tion to Dhofar, for which Watts was required, and Fowie never mentioned it until a stage was reached when we thought that batts had been definitely selected to go home and look after the Sultan. This development therefore came as a shock to us as well as to you. However I have no doubt that Loch will do the job quite adequately and Powle should be able to deal single-handed with any technical discussions that may take place. Yours sincerely, J.C.balton, Hsqr., C.B., M.C., Secy., Pol. Dept., India Office,Air Mail. Confidential. External Affairs Department, New Delhi, the 17th March 1938. My dear Fowle, Please refer to your demi-official letter No.l67-S, dated the 10th March on the subject of the deputation of a Political Officer to Muscat. You suggest the possibility of Galloway and the choice would seem to be in every way desirable provided that the Sultan agrees. There is however no prospect of Galloway acsdxfchxx beire; available until about October, as we cannot his, find another officer until then to take Jdgiplace as Secretary at Bushire. The same difficulty however applies to almost ary- other officer vfao could be mentioned, so that I see no objec tion to your mentioning the matter to the Sultan when you see him in London and ascertaining his reactions to the proposal. This letter should reach you at Bahrain before you leave dor London, but I am sending a copy to Walton by Air Mail which will certainly reach him before you arrive in London and I have asked him to di ow it to you as soon as you arrive.

I am afraid my reply must be that in my opinion Bremner would be quite unsuited to the appointment in question. My views are based on his v/ork as Political Agent, Muscat, in which connection please see paragraph No.2 of my demi-official letter^No.437-3 of 22nd June 1935. 3. Naturally if the Sultan insists on getting rid of Byard, we shall have to agree, but I think we should try to make an effort on his behalf with His Highness that he should be kept on. I took considerable trouble with the aid of the India Gffice while on leave to choose him from a number of applicants. &gt; 4. He knows Arabic having had experience in the Sudan, is a capable and tactful officer, keen on his job and has greatly improved the Levy Corps. He has, moreoever, on the one hand worked in well with us, and on the other, has kept on good terms with the Sultan. He is, in my opinion, quite capable of doing any other work, besides looking after the Levy Corps, which the Sultan wishes to give him, and that was in fact the original idea on which he was engaged. * &amp;-L. 5. If, hdwever, the Sultan is still obdurate, he shall have to look round for somebody else, especially in view of the fact that, if we do not provide him with an officer, he can get one of his own choosing from any quarter - not necessarily even English - who might be most unsuitable from our point of view. 6./6* The choice lies between (a) an officer of the Political Service, and (b) a retired officer - like Byard of some other Government Service. With regard to (a) the choice is small owing to the very few officers of the Service who know any Arabic at all, and one of the qualifications for the post would certainly be a knovdedge of that language. 7. If you agree I propose approaching the Sultan on the subject when next I see him and the question of who should replace Byard could perhaps be postponed until the Sultan T final decision is known? 8.

Tith regard to paragraph 3 , nothing was said here about any proposal to visit Italy and I do not suppose that you have any further information. Personally I should be inclined to deprecate any attempt to dissuade His Highness from going there, if he has made up his mind to do so. That opinion is however based on a' comparatively slight acquaintance with the Sultan and I snould be grateful for your views on the queiDtion raised by '//alton at the end of paragraph 3 . ^- n Paragraph 4 of his letter ,/alton raises two quest i ons (a) that of providing the Sultan with a British Officer. We have already had some Private and Personal correspondence on this subject and I have written to you demi-off icially asking for your general views. This is a matter in wnich tne ficeroy is also raking a personal interest and he hopes that it may be possiblefto make some officer a/ailable 101 the purpose. Have you any suggestions ? (B)/(b) the question of the arms subsidy. My idea was that the Sultan would himself raise the matter officially through you, but he will hardly of course be inaposition to do this ant,i 1 he returns co Muscat. You will remember the previous correspondence on the subject which I have again examined. it was agreed between us in 1935 , when we were both at home, that there was no justification for making any further recommendation for the continuance of the subsidy. in this connection please see your demi-official letter No.848-8. dated the 7 th November 1935 . There was some subsequent correspondence in 1936 (vide your demi- official letter No. 526 - 8 . of 1936 , dated the 1st July 1936 to Caroe) in which reference was made to the Sultan's liberation from his previous agreement with regard to the arms traffic by reason of the withdrawal of the subsidy. The recent interest shown by both the Japanese and Italians in the Persian Gulf might possibly provide a reason for revising the attitude towards this question which you took up in 1935 and 1936 . If therefore you like to raise the question of the subsidy without waiting for a direct application from the Sultan, 1 would certainly have it considered here and it would then be possible to agree with the suggestions made by Valton in paragraph q of his letter. 4 * 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Talton and it might perhaps save time if you sent a copy of your reply direct to him. Yours sincerely, (3d.) H.A.F. Metcalfe The Hon f hie Lieutenant Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle , K. 0 . I.f.,C.3.E. , Political Resident in the Persian Gul]P.Z.8203/37 Confidential , Sea Mail, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.l, 13th January, 1938, My dear Metcalfe, Many thanks for your letters of 16 and 26 November, enclosing accounts of the interview between His Excellency the Viceroy and His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, and of the discussion which you had with the Sultan on 17 November, It is satisfactory that the Sultan agreed to prolong the Treaty for another year; and though no important decisions were arrived at on other points, the reception of the Sultan by His Excellency and the discussions which have taken place cannot fail to have a beneficial effect on relations with Muscat. Sir A 2* We feel here, and have no doubt that the Government of India agree, that it is peculiarly important at the present juncture that our relations with the Sultan should be as harmonious as possible, - the more so since in the previous discussions in connection with his world tour he showed some disposition to emphasise his independence in relation to foreign powers. For these reasons more than ordinary importance will attach to the Sultan’s visit to London and we are anxious to do everything possible to make it a success and to encourage in him an attitude of friendliness and confidence. 3. It is rather disturbing that, as appears from Bushire Express Letter of 19 October No. 719-S and Bushire Telegram of 17 November No. 1112, the Sultan intends to make a visit, even though/ . Metcalfe, IC,C.I.E, , G*B« , M,V,0, , Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department.2 though it may be a private one, to Italy on his return journey from this country. We should be glad to learn whether anything emerged in the course of the discussions in India to show whether His Highness sets any great store by this visit. In view of the desirability of keeping Muscat within the British sphere of influence a visit to Rome would obviously have its risks. I do not know v/hether it would be possible to do anything tactfully, while he is in London, to attempt to dissuade him from such a visit, but we should be glad to know what the Government of India think as to the desirability and practicability of such an attempt. 4. As a means of helping to maintain and strengthen friendly relations with the Sultan the Government of India will agree that it is desirable to do anything that may be possible to remove any grievances which the Sultan may feel on minor matters, and to give him any small favours which may be practicable. The Government of India will no doubt bear this consideration in view in considering the matters which the Sultan raised in his discussion with you. Two at least of the questions discussed, however, appear to be of considerable importance, viz. the provision of the services of s British officer as Wazir, and the question of the Arms Traffic subsidy. As regards the first question it seems to us that it would be desirable, not only as a means of gratifying the Sultan, but also from the point of view of our own interests, toprovide him with the services of a British officer to give him 'expert advice in the management of his foreign relations', since this is just the point at which it is ao important to preserve our influence, and on which there may be some risk of his breaking away. We therefore greatly hope that it will be possible to lend the services of a suitable officer (if not Colonel Bremner then at any rate some other officer) for this purpose. As regards the Arms subsidy we must of course await/await the examination of the question by the Government of India. If, however, the Sultan should return to this question during his visit to London, it would be of advantage if we could tell him that the Government of India already have it “under consideration. Generally speaking, we should be glad if as much progress as possible could be made in examining the questions&gt; both small and great* which were raised by the Sultan in India, and where this is possible, v/ithout v/aiting for His Highness’s return to Muscat. As regards point 6 in the note of your discussion the payment in question has now been made, and the question referred to in point 5 is also being dealt with. 5. in our Express Letter of 22 December, P.Z.7666/37, we suggested the desirability of having a Political officer in London during the Sultan’s visit, who would be competent to conduct any discussion of the revision of the 1891 Treaty. The Sultan has also himself suggested (vide enclosure in Bushire Express Letter of 20th December No.865-S) that he might discuss with the India Office the Political Agreement relating to the oil concession given to Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and there is the possibility that he may, during his visit to London, refer to some of the matters discussed in India. In view of the number and importance of the matters v/hich it may be opportune or necessary to discuss in London (including possibly the expediency of the visit to Italy) there may be much to be said for sending Powle himself home on short deputation for the period of the Sultan’s stay in this country in addition to Watts who, it is understood, may in any case be coming on leave about that time and whose assistance would be useful as officer attached to the Sultan. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.C. Walton.(^) Servlcfes of Colonel Brenrner . This is an entirely new suggestion and we cannot do anything until we receive the views of the Government of India and the Political Hesident.FILE CO^Y A / i | 3 Q Extract from Note of on 17.11.37. 'between Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary, External Affairs Department, and His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, at which the Political Agent, Muscat, was also present. M (3) Services of Colonel Bremner . The Sultan mentioned that in his interview with His Excellency he had asked for the services of Colonel Bremner of the Indian Political Service to be put at his disposal if possible for employment as Wazir of the State. Secretary pointed out that the total cost of Colonel Bremner f s services would amount approximately to half a lakh of rupees per annum. The Sultan said he was quite prepared to provide the sum as he was well acquainted with Colonel Bremner and wanted some capable officer to conduct his foreign relations. The Sultan mentioned that he was desirous, if Colonel Bremne^s services were made available, of terminating the contract of Captain Byard at present serving as Commandant of the Muscat Levy Corps. The Sultan stated that Captain Byard was perfectly satisfactory so far as the conduct of his work in command of the Levy went, but in view of the amount of his pay (Hs.1,400 a month) he considered that for that sum he should be able to obtain an officer who was capable of carrying out other important work in the State. He stated he did not consider that Captain Byard was competent to do such work. The Sultan declared that he had not mentioned the matter to Colonel Bremner when he saw him recently. Secretary said he would go into the question of obtaining Colonel Bremner’s services and if this was not possible, to endeavour to obtain some other suitable officer.Q Extract from Note of an interview^fe^tifeeto' Excellency the Viceroy, and His Highnes the Sultan of Muscat, at which Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary, External Affairs Department, was also present. v y 4. His Highness then stated that he found himself in considerable difficulty owing to want of expert advice in the management of his foreign relations and suggested that it would be advantageous to him and to us, if he could get the services of a qualified British Officer to assist him. He mentioned the name of Colonel Bremner, who was for two years as Political Agent at Muscat before Major Watts. This again is entirely a new suggestion and one which will require to be treated with some caution. When Major Bremner was at Muscat, he succeeded in winning the Sultan’s confidence to a considerable extent, but during the last few months of his tenure of the office, partly owing to ill-health and partly to his own peculiar temperament, his relations with Colonel Powle became extremely bad and he wrote a number of very insubordinate letters to v/hich Colonel Eowle took very just exception. He also protested in immoderate language against Major Watts’ appointment, and it would, I feel sure, be quite impossible for him to go back as the Sultan’s Adviser, while Colonel ^owle is Political Resident or while Major Watts is Political Agent. I am doubtful whether the position would be any happier if and when Colonel Daly succeeds Major Watts, since the Political Agent would obviqusly find it extremely difficult to fulfil his responsibilities towards the Sultan and to Government, unless the British Officer advising the Sultan was on cordial terms with him and took all possible steps to safeguard the Political Agent's position. A further difficulty about Colonel Bermner is his seniority. He is at present acting as Second Class Resident on Rs.3,000/- a month and when he reverts/2 . reverts to the ordinary time-scale his pay will he approximately Rs.2,500/- a month including overseas pay. On Foreign Service, especially in Muscat he would he entitled to a 20^ increase, or at least would hardly accept the appointment on less and the Sultan would in addition have to pay pension and leave charges to the Government of India which amount approximately to 50^? of the pay. Altogether therefore the Sultan could hardly hope to obtain Colonel Bremner’s services for less than half a lakh a year, and if Major Watts 1 estimate of his character is correct, it is most unlikely that he would he prepared to undertake this expenditure. Colonel Bremner might moreover refuse to go to a place where his health suffered so severely during his tenure of the post of Political Agent. I think therefore that there will he no difficulty in squashing the proposal, unless there are very special reasons for wishing to proceed with it.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00020e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2982</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00020e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2982</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 20/22 'Muscat: Appointment of a Political Officer as Adviser to Sultan'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1938/1938</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-07-20T22:20:06</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (37 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in chronological order from the back to the front.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 39; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 3-38; these numbers are also written in pencil, and is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence, minutes, and notes relating to the appointment of a British officer as adviser to the Sultan of Muscat.
