Summary of Early History. 1. The trade in modern arms and ammunition in the Persian Gulf seems first to have attracted the attention of the Government of India during the Afghan war of 1879-80, and in the year 1880 the first restrictive measures were taken, the Government of Bombay being instructed to abstain from granting licenses for the export of heavy consignments of arms and ammunition to Persian Gulf ports and to watch carefully the import of such articles at Karachi and on the coast to the westward. 2. In 1881 the Persian Government, who seem to have realised that the trade might have dangerous consequences for themselves, issued a Decree that ' no arms or munitions of war, such as guns, caps, gunpowder, &amp;c., should ' enter Persian territory without the permission of the Great Government,' In announcing the issue of this Decree to the British Legation, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote as Persian Decree, 1881. follows on the 3rd July 1881: ' Since the Mr. Thomson to Lord Granville, 12th u 0 f purchasing arms and intro- July 1881. « ( j uc i n g the same into Persia belongs to ' the Persian Government, who exercise it through their own specially appointed ' officials, and if this absolute right were not exclusively confined to the ' Government, and everybody who thought fit to do so were allowed to ' purchase such articles and introduce them into the country, this great ' governmental privilege would become obsolete, and considerable^ evils '• W ould result to the State. Therefore His Majesty the Shah has issued ' orders that no one shall import arms of any description whatsoever into 44 this country from abroad, and any person in whose possession arms u of foreign make are found will be liable to have them confiscated by ' Government.' 3 By a Proclamation dated the 3rd March 1891, the Sultan of Muskat Gwadur Prohibition, 1891. prohibited the import and export of (Appendix IV.) arms and ammunition at (jrwadur, Mis 960/98. Highness' dependency on the Mekran coast.* The traffic thus became illegal along the whole littoral from the head of the Persian Gulf to the British border. ♦ This prohibition was apparently inconsistent with the Sultan's obligations under his commercial treaties (see paragraph 9 and footnote). But its propriety has never been challenged by any foreign Power. s. 16. a4. As regards the measures taken by the Persian authorities to enforce the Decree of 1881, it may be noted that in May 1891 both the Shah himself State of the traffic, 1891-97. a 1 nd / , , he Amm-es-Sultan telegraphed to Sir M. Durand to Lord Salisbury, 10th the Governor of iki shire complaining of June 1898. the sale of arms in Tehran by British and 2040/98. Parsee merchants, and giving strict orders that the prohibition on imports should be maintained, and all arms imported should be confiscated. In the year 1893 the local authorities seized seventeen cases of arms consigned to a Muscat firm, which were landed at Bushire for transhipment, on the ground that complaints had been received from the Turkish Government of arms being smuggled from Persian territory. The goods were confiscated. In the year 1895 the British steamer ' Zulu ' landed by mistake at the Bushire custom-house several cases of arms consigned toMuskat; these were seized by the local authorities. In January 1897, while the ' Zulu ' case was still pending, the first preventive officer was appointed at Bushire by the Persian Government. Apart from these incidents, there is nothing to show that effective measures were taken to prevent the smuggling of arms, and on the 15th Q* lu - 'n /j + t ^ g i■ u irui A P ril Sir Durand, in a oir JVl. Uurand to Liorcl o3#lisuiirv. loth ,1 4. 4. ~r 101*1 1 • t April 1896. despatch to Lord Salisbury, admitted that there could be ' little doubt that a ' considerable illicit import of arms into Persia is being carried on, and that ' European firms are not wholly unconcerned in it.' The appointment of the Persian preventive officer seems to have made little difference to the traffic, and the number of rifles imported steadily increased, the great majority of the weapons being of British manufacture. 0. The principal merchants engaged in the traffic during this period were Messrs. A. and 1. J. Malcolm of Bushire, a Persian Armenian tirm under British protection, and Messrs. Fracis, Times, and Co., a Parsee and English house whose first agency was established at Bushire in 1887, three years alter Messrs. Malcolm began to import arms.

In the same year (1897) it (Appendix V.) was decided to take up the Question 5th January^898 nge ^ Lord SalisbmT ' actlvel y with the Persian Government, ' 1775/98. and at the close of the year the latter, ,, , a . as a result of British pressure, agreed that _ m addition to such measures as ' may be taken by Persian officials, Her u -vlajesty s ships should examine and search all merchant-vessels tradino- in the 1 ersian Gulf, and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government ail prohibited arms found on board.' The Grand Vizier's note of the ( th December 1897, in which this Agreement was embodied, further stated that the 1 ersian Government was ready 'to join with Her Majesty's Govern- &lt;{ inen &gt; t iii lequesting the feultan of Muskat to notify in the ports and &lt;&lt; ^ 111 t ories Muskat that arms should not be imported from that side into eisia oi Hindustan, also that English ships should exercise in regard to scaich and confiscation the same rights in Muskat as in Persian waters.' 1 he joint i epi esentations to the Sultan of Muskat were successful. The Sultan fell in with the suggestion that he should co-operate in the Muskat Agreement, 1898. suppiession of the arms traffic, and on (Appendix VI.) the 13th January 1898, he issued (1) a Government of India's letter of 10th Notification warning his subjects that February 189b. ^ the importation of arms and ammuni- 295 / 98 - tion into India and Persia was illegal; and (2) a Proclamation authorizing British and Persian vessels of war to search, within Muskat territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Muskat flag, as well as Muskat vessels in Indian and Persian waters, and to confiscate arms and ammunition intended for Indian and Persian ports. In his letter to the Resident agreeing to the issue of these documents, the Sultan said (13th January 1898) :—'We have complied with it most willingly, ' and we associate with the British and Persian Governments in the arrange- ' ments that are made and that will be hereafter made for the suppression of ' this trade in arms and ammunition.' Power to search Muskat vessels on the high seas was obtained under the Sultan's Notification of 17th October 1903, which had special reference to the export of arms from Muskat to the Somali Coast, and was issued at the instance of the British and Italian Governments. (See Appendix XL). In June 1898, with a view to placing a further check on the arms Restrictions on British traders at traffic in Oman rules were issiied re- Muskat. quiring every British subject ' who (Appendix VIII.) u now or hereafter has or becomes Government of India's letter, 7th July ' possessed of any arms or ammunition 1898. ^ 'in the dominions of the Sultan of 707//98 ' ' Muskat, or who imports any arms or 'ammunition into the said dominions' to furnish the British Consul ' without unreasonable delay ' with a ' true and complete list and descrip tion ' of all such arms and ammunition; the lists and descriptions to be ' in such form as the said Consul may from time to time require.' 9. It should be observed (1) that the right of search authorised by the Sultan's prohibition applied only to Muskat Commercial Treaties. British, Persian, and Muskat vessels; (2) that the importation of arms into Muskat was not prohibited; and (3) that the export of arms from Muskat was only prohibited to two specified countries, viz., India and Persia. As regards (2) and (3) the Sultan was precluded by the terms of his Commercial Treaties with the United States (1833) and France (1844) (see Appendices I. and II.), and his 'Commercial4 Declaration' with Holland Reimport of arms into his except to countries where Importation was prohibited.t Declaration o£ the 10th March The position is further ^ net , ® „t s engaged ' reciprocally 1862, by which the British ^^X^o Mnlkat and Zanzibar. to respect the independence ot the aunaub (Appendix III). 10. On the 30th April 1898 the ^aX ^ Bahrein Agreement, 1898. &lt;k absolutely to prohibit the importation (Appendix VII.) u arms into Bahrein territory or Govevnme^ of inclms lette i- 0 i u exportatioll therefrom'; and to ^ L ' 711/98. enforce the prohibition, he issued on ihe same day— • . A (1.) A Notification declaring that the import and export of arms into and from the Islands of Bahrein was absolutely forbidden and that m future all arms and ammunition imported or exported wouh )e seized and confiscated as property of the State. (2.) A Proclamation conferring on British and Persian vessels ot wai permission to search vessels carrying the British, 1 ersian, oi Bahrein flag in Bahrein territorial waters, as well as Bahrein vessels in Indian or Persian waters, and to confiscate all arms and ammunition (weapons of war) intended for Indian or Persian poits, or for the Islands of Bahrein. 11 It was owing to the i \2;reement with the Sultan of Muskat that I fer ' 'Baluchistan'Case. ' Majesty's ship 'Lapwing' was able, 'Times' Law Reports, 5tli July 1898 on the 24th January 189b, to seize the and 9th July 1901. ' steamer ' Baluchistan,' near Muskat, and capture the cargo of arms she was carrying. An action was brought by Messrs. Fracis, Times, &amp; Co., who had shipped a consignment of arms by the ' Baluchistan,' against the Sea Insurance Company, Limited, to recover a loss under a policy of marine insurance on the consignment. This loss the Company had refused to pay on two grounds : (1) That the plaintills had, when effecting the insurance, concealed a fact material to the estimation of the risk, viz., that the importation of arms was forbidden by Persian law ; and (2) that the adventure was illegal, as being in contravention to the law of nations. Mr. Justice Bigham, in giving judgment for the plaintiffs, held that ' the import of arms was not illegal according to the law of Persia, as that law was administered in practice and enjoined,' or, in other words, that no real prohibition existed on the importation of arms into Persian ports. * The ' Commercial Declaration ' of 1877 merely provided for reciprocal ' most-favoured nation ' treatment between Holland and Muskat. It seems doubtful whether the terms of this instniment could be held to preclude the Sultan from placing a general embargo on the importation of arms into his territory. {See despatch from Her Majesty's Minister at the Hague, dated 3rd November 1897, 2323/97.) The French and American treaties, on the other hand, provide expressly for unrestricted importation of all kinds of merchandise. The American treaty makes [special mention of munitions of war ('muskets, powder, and ball ') which are to be 'freely sold without any restriction whatever at all the Sultan 's ports outside the Island of Zanzibar. (See / } iQ^n\ Ce i / and 1 V commerc i a l Treaty of 1891 (which superseded an earlier Treaty ot 1839) between the Sultan and Great Britain also contains a clause providing for the unrestricted import of all kinds of merchandise into Muskat territory. he British, h rench, and United States treaties all provide for the levy of a duty not exceeding 5 per cent, on all imports into Muskat ^ that 0n 1 1 7th 0ct0ber 1903 the Sultan o£ Muskat is ™« i a Notification I bitmg the export of arms and ammunition from Oman to the portions of the African W ' idl aro Under British Bliti.h an^lSri f whlch are nnder the ItaHan Protectorate, and granW Mnskat vessels on the high scaf an,, i* it Ic 8 into his P revi ? usl y. en initiative, forbidden the import of &gt;s, 4c., into his territory by a Notification issned in January 1896. (See Appendix VII. (3) ) armsAmong the underwriters who suffered loss in consequence of this decision were the North China Insurance Company, Limited. This Company petitioned His Majesty's Government in January 1902 (1932/02), and again in July 1906 (3280/06), to be compensated for their losses. The petition was refused on both occasions. As regards the legality of the act of seizure, the question was determined by the further action brought by Messrs. Fracis, Times, &amp; Co., against Captain Carr, R.N., the officer who had seized the ' Baluchistan,' for wrongful deprivation of property. Mr. Justice Grantham, who tried the case in the first instance, found for the defendant, and his judgment, after being reversed by the Court of Appeal, was finally upheld by the House of Lords, on the .ground that the seizure had taken place in Muskat territorial waters, and was, under the Sultan's Proclamation of January 1898, justifiable according to the law of Muskat. A third action was brought against Colonel Meade, Resident in the Persian Gulf, by Messrs. Fracis, Times, &amp; Co., in respect of arms and ammunition seized at Bushire in December 1897, and at Bahrein in January 1898. Judgment was given for the defendant in May 1901. The effect of these proceedings was to reduce Messrs. Fracis, Times, &amp;Co., to bankruptcy ; and to impose, for the time being, a decided check on the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. 12. On the 1st January 1900 the Shah promulgated a law reaffirming the Persian Law of 1900. prohibition against the importation into Mr. Spring-Rice to Lord Salisbury, Persia of arms and ammunition, as well 28th May 1900. as various other commodities. The 2220/00. caS e of the British steamer ' Hathor,' on board of which arms were seized at Bushire in November 1900, led to an Order in Council being issued, on the recommendation of the Law Officers of the Crown, by which the Persian Law of the 1st January 1900 was made applicable to British subjects, in so far as the provisions respecting arms and ammunition were concerned. 13. On the 24th May 1900 the Sheikh of Koweit entered into an Tr • j A innn agreement with the British Govern- 0Wei (Appendix ix!) * ment, by wdiich he engaged ' absolutely Government of India's letter of 5th July ' to prohibit the importation of arms 1900. into Koweit, or exportation there- 737/00. from.' To carry out this engagement, he issued on the same day (1) a Notification declaring that u the importation ' of arms and ammunition into Koweit and the territory under my control, ' and the exportation of the same, are absolutely prohibited,' and that ' all ' arms and ammunition imported into any parts of Koweit ^territory, or ' exported therefrom, in future will be seized and confiscated ; (2) a Pio- clamation conferring on British and Persian vessels of war the right to search, in Koweit territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Koweit flag, as well as Koweit vessels m Indian and 1 ersian waters , and to confiscate any arms and ammunition destined for Indian, Persian, or Koweit ports. It should be added that it was decided that the Koweit Agreement should not be published, and that no action should be taken in the way of search or seizure of Koweit vessels without special instructions from Her Majesty s Government. 14. In November 1902 the Trucial Chiefs entered into an engagement to prohibit absolutely the import and Trucial Chiefs Agreement, 1902. export of arms and ammunition to and (Appendix X.) f rom their territory ; and, to carry out Government of India's letter, 29th this engagement, issued a notification January 1903. ^ declaring that the traffic was absolutely 257 / 03 - prohibited, and that all arms and ammu- nition imported into, or exported from, their territories would be seized and confiscated. s. 16. bnr Position of Turkey. Government of India's letter, July 1903. 1112/03. , 30th Sir N. O'Conor to Lord Lansdowne, 16th November 1903. 3364/03. 15. In a despatch dated the 30th July 1903 the Government of India recommended that, m order to mal\e the ciicle ol the Ou 11' comph tc, an endeavour should be made to come to an arrangement with Turkey per mitting vessels under the Turkish flag to be searched for arms by British ships of war, or, failing this, that the Porte should be asked to notify formally to His Majesty's Government that the importation of arms into Ottoman dominions without special licence was prohibited. Sir N. O'Conor, who was consulted on the matter, drew attention to the notifications 0 that had already been made by the Turkish Government on the subject, and suggested that they might sufficiently serve the purpose the Govern ment of India had in view. As regards the right of search. Sir N. O'Conor wrote ' In conversation with the Minister ' of Foreign Affairs, I gathered that the Turkish Government would be ' willing enough to co-operate in our endeavours to suppress the traffic in ' arms, but that the right to search Turkish vessels could only be conceded ' in exchange for a reciprocal privilege, an arrangement which, however ' one-sided it might prove in practice, would, in principle, be open to obvious ' objections.' The question was accordingly allowed to drop, His Majesty's Government accepting Sir ^N. O Conor s view as to the sufficiency of the notifications already made by the Turkish Government. (See also paragraph 02.) It should be added that no prohibition is m force in respect of the El Katr ^ Katr peninsula, which thus forms n nf „ mi ^ ^ an exception to the 'circle of the Gulf. rhe political status of El Katr is peculiar, Turkish sovereignty being claimed by the Porte, but not recognised by His Majesty's Government. See also paragraph 62.1 Proposal to extend Muskat Prohibition. Government of India's letter of 31st March 1904. 750/04. 16. In March 1904 the Government of India proposed that the terms of | ■ the Muskat Proclamation of 1898 should be extended so as to cover the export of arms to Turkish ports, and to the territories of the Sheikhs of Bahrein oo . n , &lt;{i j • , _ . and Koweit, and of the Trucial ChiVf^ as well as to Indian and Persian ' ports which ilrpnrlv foil 'fi * 4i ' of the Prorlnmntirm Th\ a pons, wmen already lell within the scope reclamation.

In the preceding paragraphs a brief summary has been given of the o • j j • . tvt i + earlier history of the arms traffic in the Situation at Muskat. n i / i * ^ . i 1 ersian Cxult and of the measures taken with a view to its suppression. Speaking generally, it cannot be said that those measures were attended with much success. It was generally acknow ledged that the key to the question lay at Muskat, and that until that port was closed to the importation of arms it would be impossible to place any effective check on the export trade by native dhows to other ports on the Gulf littoral. Owing, however, to the terms of the Sultan's commercial treaties {see paragraph 9), the importation of arms into His Highness's dominions couJd not be prohibited without the consent of the French Government, a consent which there appeared to be small likelihood of obtaining.']' Meanwhile the import trade from Europe to Muskat rapidly increased. According to figures supplied by the British Customs authorities, the number of rifles imported from Great Britain, which was then the main source of supply, rose from 5,435 in 1898 to 13,831 in 1900. The total number of rifles imported into Muskat from all sources in 1900-01 was declared by the Muskat Customs to be 25,000. The figure declined to 17,000 in 1901-02, and in the following year (1902-03) there was also a decrease. But in 190-1-05, ' in spite of the fact that the local Oman market had long since been glutted,' the number of rifles imported from all quarters was estimated at not less than 20,000 ; in 1906-07 the numbers rose to 44,927, and in 1907-08 to 87,680. In 1908-09 the number of imported rifles was returned at 85,820. The above figures, it should be observed, are based for the most part on statistics furnished by the Muskat Customs authorities, and it is not possible to vouch for their accuracy. The same remark applies to the figures given below of the values of the arms and ammunition imported into Muskat. The table below was included by the Government of India in their despatch of the 2nd September 1909, as giving the ' most reliable figures ' which they had been able to obtain. It will be seen that as regards imported rifles, the figures given in this table are somewhat smaller than those given above. * In view of the support rendered by the Turks to Abdul Aziz bin Rashid, Amir of Nejd, one of the warring chiefs in the interior, the Government of India (telegrams of 20th and 29th Ma}' 1904) considered that no additional check should, for the time being, be imposed on the arms traffic at Koweit, which was the main source of supply to the rival chieftain, Abdul Aziz bin Saoud, Amir of the Wahabi. This view was approved by His Majesty's Government on the 24th June 1904. t In their despatches of 29th January and 30th July 1903, the Government of India urged that the French Government should be approached with a view to obtaining their consent to the prohibition of the importation of arms and ammunition into Muskat. On the 1st October 1903 Lord Lansdowne suggested informally to the French Minister in London that the British and French Governments might cooperate in inducing the Sultan to expel M. Goguyer (see- paragraph 18) and to put a stop to the arms traffic. M. Geoffray returned a guarded answer, and nothing further seems to have come of the suggestion.i,. -r .-v. ....

Goguyer's participation in the illicit traffic, and informed the Political Agent that he had insti uctions to give all possible assistance in preventing the export of arms to prohibited localities.- M. Goguyer died at Muskat on the 16th October 1909. Another French merchant, M. Caracalla, ' encouraged by the success of his pre decessor,' visited Muskat in July 1906, with the apparent object of taking part in the arms trade. M. Caracalla again visited Muskat in Xovembei 1907, and his name and those of MM. Goguyer, Baijeot, and Kevorkoff were included in a list furnished by the Political Agent in the same month ol French subjects engaged in the traffic (Major Grey to Government of India, 2nd November 1907, 2114/07). The main effect of the restrictions imposed upon British Indian traders at Muskat on the 27th June 1898 {see paragraph 8 and Appendix VIII.) seems to have been to throw the trade to an increasing extent into foreign hands. - d , . tj i i The question of cancelling these restric- Restnctions on British dealers. 1 , ' r tions was raised by the Government oi India, at the instance of the Political Agent, Muskat,| and the Resident in the Persian Gulf, in their despatch of 30tli July 1903. ' So long as the trade 1112/03 ' con ti nu es,' they wrote, ' it is desirable ' that, so far as possible, it should ' remain in the hands of British subjects rather than that it should pass to ' French firms, and that business at Muskat should thus become more ' profitable than ever to M. Goguyer and his fellows. We realise that the ' regulations in question must tend to place British traders at a disadvantage ' compared with their rivals of other nationalities, and we are inclined to ' think that this consideration more than outweighs the advantage of the ' limited degree of control which the rules secure.' His Majesty's Govern ment decided, however, that no action should be taken at the time, pending the result of a reference which had been made to the French Government on the general subject (see paragraph 17, footnote). The question was again raised by the Government of India in a despatch dated the 18th August 1904 ( 1 564/04); and again in their despatch of 21st February 1907/see para graph 32 (4) On the latter occasion His Majesty's Government decided (Despatch to Government of India, 31st May 1907) that the restrictions should be maintained pending the meeting of the Brussels Arms Conference in Apn! 1908 It should be added that on the 5th May 1909 the Foreign Office informed Messrs. Kynoch that there was no likelihood of any relaxation of the regulations issued m June 1898. impoLdLStk^ h th P U r imate destina ' io ? 1 . of the arms and ammunition npoited into Muskat, the Government of India, m their Despatch of 30th Julv 1903, expressed the view that 'the existence of any considerable traffic h t he African seaboard has n ot been est ablished, and it see^ probaWe that Major Grey reported that the^ultan'oolMkat T'I Si,t ' Kf / lctor - v , ()n 18th November 1907 sell arms and ammunition to Afghans in fuW fw fu x. , A *'f b arms merchants to a circular to the Consul had also i SS ued cerf^S^S - — -3, iron.

Some four years later, in February 1907, the Government of India reported that further experience had confirmed their view that 'no J traffic in arms worth considering is carried on between Muskat and the African seaboard.''' ' On the other hand,' the} 7 wrote, 'there can be no ;; doubt that by far the greater part of the arms landed at Muskat leave again by sea, and that Muskat has now earned the reputation of being the arms depot of the entire Middle East.' 20. As regards the situation on the Persian Coast it may be said generally Situation on Persian Coast. that the measures adopted by the Persian 1807 06 authorities have had little or no effect in stopping the traffic. Mr. Grant-Duff, British Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, wrote in July 1906: ' There is no ' present likelihood of the Persian Government taking the slightest trouble ' to put an end to it. Even if they desired to do so, 1 doubt if thev have the power. The Government of India have from time to time done what they could to check the trade at the Persian ports. In 1900, a Vice-Consul was appointed to Bunder Abbas, where ' it was hoped that the presence of a British officer ' might lead to the display of greater vigour in the repression of the illicit ' importation of arms along the neighbouring portions of the Persian coast.' In 1902, measures were concerted with the Persian Governor-General of Mekran to prevent the importation of arms into Persian Baluchistan, and to impose restrictions on their possession in that province. A further conference on the subject took place between the Persian officials on the Mekran border and the British frontier officers in 1906, leading to the conclusion of an agreement signed at Karwan on the 26th May 1906, by which thirteen 'headmen and greybeards' of the ports of Persian Baluchistan engaged to hold themselves responsible for stopping the importation of arms and ammu nition. The agreement was countersigned by Captain McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, by the Persian Governor of Baluchistan, by Sirdar Said Khan, of Kapch, who described himself as holding the Nizamat of Persian Mekran, by the Customs Mudir of Chahbar, and by a representative of the Persian Foreign Office. (See Appendix XII.) The desire to cope with the illegal traffic in arms was also one of the reasons which led, in the same year (1906), to the temporary appointment (since discontinued) of a Vice- Consul at Barn. But little advantage could be expected from the .co-operation of Persian officials, who, whatever their intentions might be, had not the means of interfering effectively with the trade. Lieutenant G. D. Ogilvie, who travelled through Persian Baluchistan in 1-33/06 June 1906, on his way to take up his duties as Vice-Consul at Bam, reported that the local Persian authorities were quite incapable of dealing with the traffic, and that the Afghans! employed in smuggling arms up country from the coast were invariably w T ell armed, and could overcome any opposition offered to them with the greatest ease. The same view was expressed by the Resident in the Persian Gulf, in his Annual Administration Report for 1906-07. 'There is little doubt,' he wrote, ' that the three chiefs in charge of the coastal portion of the Karwan * On the other hand, the Colonial Office in March 1909, expressed the view that the effect of the arms traffic at Muskat on the position in Somaliland ' cannot be overlooked, as the ' Mullah draws some of his supplies from this source, and one of his dhows was recently ' captured by an Italian man-of-war while on its way from Illig ' to Muskat. (Colonial Office to Foreign Office, 13th March 1909, 3118/09). t Prior to 1903 arms for Afghanistan and the Indian frontier were mainly purchased at Bunder Abbas, and conveyed thence by the annual autumn caravans of Afghan merchants.

The true facts ot the case are that the ' authorities have no power to do anything. When three 'smugglers have only to avoid Khwash, where is a //aam with tluee ' soldiers, and they have a clear space, practically uninhabited as far as ' Seistan.' 21 Mr. Grant Duff, in July 1906, thought it possible that when the live _ . , launches, then under construction at Attitude of Belgian Customs Officials. Bombay for the Persian Government, had been supplied to the Customs Department, ' something may be done by the Belgian .officials^ to check the arms traffic.' These launches were supplied during 1906-07, but they seem to have had no appreciable effect upon the trade. . The attitude of the Belgian officials towards the trade at that time may Q n , be illustrated by an incident reported by Lieutenant C. T. Daukes, Consul at Seistan, in June 1906. On the 1st May 1906 the British Consul received information that a caravan carrying rifles and accompanied by armed Afghans had started inland from the Gulf, together with details of its probable route through Persian territory to the Afghan frontier. M. Cattersel, the local Director of Customs, was at once urged to take steps to apprehend the caravan, but, under considerable pressure, declined to do more than give a vague promise that he would offer a reward for its seizure. On the 11th May news was received of the near approach of the caravan, and M. Cattersel was again urged to make some attempt to intercept it. Nothing was done, however, and on the 28th May the caravan was reported to have passed through to Band-i-Kamal Khan on the Helmund. In the words used by Mr. Daukes in reporting the incident, ' ample warning was given, even the ' route of the caravan was correctly gauged ; and yet, in spite of the facilities ' thus afforded them (i.e., the Belgian officials), no steps were taken.' 22.

In April 1908, in view of the numbers and strength of the arms caravans, the military detachment at Robat' :;: ' was reinforced by 500 infantry for a period of four months. This force formed a cordon along the Perso-Baluch frontier from near Mashki Shah to Robat, but was not allowed to operate inside Persian territory. The result was to prevent any arms caravans crossing the portion of British territory lying between Persia and Afghanistan, the only caravan that attempted to cross this tract withdrawing hastily on finding the road blocked. But this success brought with it no appreciable advantage. As Sir H. McMahon, o- tt -»r ^ i . n ^ . Agent to the Governoi'-General in bir ii.

A few words may be said about the state of the trade at other ports in the Gulf. At Koweit, in spite of the Sheikh's agreement in 1900 (see paragraph 13 Situation at Koweit. and A PP e V dix little attempt if70.08 seems to have been made to check the import of arms. In May 190G, Major Knox, the Political Agent at Koweit, found it necessary formally to remind Sheikh Mubarak of his prohibition, and to request that it might be more strictly enforced. The Sheikh did not take the reminder in good part, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf gave his opinion that the question was one which might at any time endanger the good relations between the Sheikh and the Political Agent. Major Knox put the case still more strongly in a letter to the Resident. ' The Proclamation,' he wrote on the 3rd July 1906, ' is not worth the paper it is written on, and is onty a cause of friction.' The latest reports point to a large and increasing traffic at Koweit.f It is noteworthy that in October 1908 Sheikh Mubarak is reported to have ' twice despatched in his steam launch large quantities of arms and ' ammunition to his friend Sheikh Khazal' (of Mohammerah). The action taken by the British, India Steam Navigation Company in 1907 to check the smuggling of arms in the Company's steamers seems to have had little effect beyond increasing importations into Koweit by country craft. Representations were mad'e by the Italian Government in March 1908 (on information received from the nakhoda 30d6 08 ' of an Arab dhow, the ' Fath-el-Rahman,' chartered by an Italian merchant at Hodeida) as to the alleged smuggling of arms from Muskat to Koweit by a British steamer in the previous summer. The Italian Government, in bringing the case to notice, dwelt on the ' necessity ' of taking steps in order that the Bay of Muskat may not become a centre ' for the traffic of arms with Somaliland.' Enquiries were made by the Government of India which showed the 1887/08. facts to be that the British India Com pany's steamer ' Dwarka,' on arrival at Mohammerah from Bushire on the 5th' September 1907, was found to have on board a certain number of unclaimed suspicious cases. These cases were handed over by the * There was already at Robat a double company (about 200 men) of Native infantry, which was originally despatched in 1906 as an escort to a reserve of arms and ammunition required for the British Consulates at Meshed and Seistan, and with the object of affording protection, if necessary, to British subjects. This detachment had been retained at Robat in consequence of disturbances in Seistan, and other events, which seemed to render it desirable to have a British force located on the Perso-Baluch border. t In October 1907, as many as 6,000 rifles were said to have been imported into Koweit in a single week.—Administration Report, 1907-08.

In October 1905 the Sheikh of Bahrein addressed a memorial to the Government ol India, in which, among other alleged 1054/06. grievances, he complained of the fact that he was obliged to interdict the sale of arms, and was thereby deprived of an advantage enjoyed by all the Arab Chiefs along the Arabian coast. He was informed in repl}*, in May 1906, that the restric tion on the importation of arms at Bahrein had first been imposed in 1895 bv himself on his own initiative, and his attention was drawn to the measures he had himself spontaneously taken from time to time to stop the traffic. It was also pointed out to him that the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast had similarly prohibited the traffic of arms in their territory, and he was given to understand that the Government of consider moment the possibility of cancelling or modifying the Agreement he had concluded with the British Government on this point. Nevertheless, there is every reason to believe that a considerable amount of illicit arms traffic has gone on at Bahrein. In December 1906 the Resident in the Persian Gulf furnished evidence that the port was rapidly rising to importance as a centre of the trade, and that the arms business, hitherto confined to one dealer, had been taken over by a Company, two of the shareholders being friends of the Sheikh himself and opponents of Customs reform.In the Persian Gulf Administration Report for the year 1906-07, the Resident noted that Bahrein was ' quickly establishing its ' reputation as a convenient entrepot for the distribution of arms through the small ports of the Persian littoral.' Later reports indicated that signs of ^ the illicit traffic were less apparent at Bahrein during the years 1907 and 1908. But there was no reason to suppose that it had ceased to exist. 25.

Thus, on the 30th July 1906 the Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier iiovince reported that a large number of Martini-Henry carbines had recently tound their way into tribal territory. These rifles, he remarked, had been tor sale m Afghanistan during the previous winter, and a considerable numbei had been purchased by. independent tribesmen at prices ranging jrom lis. loO to Ks. 200. He added that the appearance of the carbines had been noticed almost simultaneously amongst the Mohmands in Tirah and &lt;&lt; ?v • P ai ^ s n the Khyber Agency, on the Kurram border, and in V\ azmstan.' The weapons were said to be part of a very large consignment li mn the Gulf for Russian Central Asia, which had been stopped by the Afghan authorities at Herat. The arms were then sent to Kabul for the Amir's orders, and were finally distributed by sale. All accounts, in fact, tended to show that the arming of the tribesmen in independent territory with modern weapons was proceeding briskly with results that were described by the (government of India in their Despatch of the 21st February 1907 as ' constituting a grave menace to the peace of the border.' As regards the actual number of rifles (derived from all sources, including local manufacture) in the possession of the tribesmen, the Government of India estimated in February 1907 that, out of 270,000 men belonging to the frontier tribes, 94,000 possessed breech-loading rifled arms. The latest information available gives the figures on the 30th April 1909 as follows :—Total fighting strength of tribesmen, 334,005 ; breech- loading rifles or carbines, 152,426 ; muzzle-loading rifles, 56,943 * See also paragraph 41 (2). 26. As regards Afghanistan, the Government of India reported early in 1907 that they had recently received the ' disquieting intelligence ' that a c... . ai? 1 • x , number of rifles had reached the Herat of Imht ln Afg:hamstan: attltude and Kandahar districts, and were being freely sold among the tribesmen with the approval of the local Afghan officials. The Government of India added that ' the trade in these arms is no longer prohibited by the Amir in u accordance with the policy pursued by his father, and His Majesty is ' reported to have stated openly that he has no objection to the acquisition ' of weapons of precision by his subjects, and to have rewarded some of the ' principal men engaged in the trade.' In August 1908 it was reported that the Amir had granted general permission to Afghan traders to bring arms and ammunition from the Persian Gulf, and had authorised advances to respectable traders for the purpose; and subsequent reports have furnished further evidence of His Majesty's desire to promote the trade in every way. An illustration of his attitude was afforded by the protest which he t i addressed to the Viceroy on the rtth igo? 106 ™ 7 8 gram September 1907 against the action of 1792/07. the British authorities in stopping an Afghan arms caravan in Kacha Gorge in the previous May.f His Majesty complained of this seizure on the ground that the arms were being brought for the purpose of arming the people of Afghanistan, and expressed the hope that the British frontier officials would be punished, and steps taken to prevent such action in the future. The caravan, it should be noted, was actually over the border in British territory at the time of its capture. * These figures are taken from the latest edition (corrected up to 30th April 1909) of the ' Statement of fighting strengths and armament of independent Tribes on the North-West Frontier,' prepared by the Indian Intelligence Department. t The caravan was ambushed by a party under Major Webb-Ware, Political Agent, Chagai. The Afghans scattered to the surrounding hills, leaving 795 rifles and nearly 67,000 rounds of ammunition behind them. Over 70 of their camels were either killed or captured.16 It was suggested by the Secretary of State for India in August 10U8, it A\as s . t | iat advantage might be derived from a Lord Morley's Despatch, 14th August u f r i en( ]ly interchange of views ' With 1908. the Amir, in which it could be pointed 3ol3 ' 0b ' out that, if arms were required for 'nrnnmr the people of Afghanistan ' with His Majesty's permission, some other means might be devised for obtaining them which would not involve ' the traffic through Persia with the tribes on our side of the line oi the ' risk of violent conflicts in Persia between his own and British subjects This suggestion did not commend itseit Viceroy s telegram of 19th Septembei ^ (government of India. I hey ex- 1908 - 1759 08 plained that their information placed it 0 ' beyond doubt that the traffic was approved bv the Amir; the arms were imported free of duty and the trade at Kabul had been 'openly encouraged by Nasrulla and the Alghan authorities.' The Amir, the Government of India observed, considered himself entitled to import arms under the Thirand Agieement of l_lh November 1893, Article 7 of which laid down that the Government of India would 'raise no objection to the purchase and import by His Highness of munitions of war.' This view had been formally accepted by Sir L. Dane, the British Commissioner at Kabul, in March 1905. The Amir evidently preferred to let arms reach his country through Persia. In the circumstances, the Government of India thought it would be 'impolitic to raise this question just now.' The proposal to address the Amir was not pressed. But the subject was revived early in 1909, when the Secretary of State, Lord Morley's Despatch, 5th February j u a despatch to the Government of 1909 ' 28506/09 India dated the 5th February 1909, raised the question whether the Amir was aware of the engagements of His Majesty's Government with Persia and Muskat in regard to the arms traffic, and suggested that when the time came for addressing the Afghan Government ' on the increasing dangers and ' obstacles to telegraphic communications (see below, paragraph 37) which ' the proceedings of his subjects involve,'' it would be well to explain to the Amir the nature of our engagements and 'our obligation to fulfil duties ' which, more than ten years ago, were entrusted to us by the governments ' immediately concerned.' 27. It remains to notice the measures taken to suppress the arms traffic Naval Measures in the Gulf. 111 leihian Gulf by the subsidised vessels of the East Indies Squadron. Ihe question of checking the trade by intercepting dhows on their way across the Gulf was carefully considered by the naval authorities in the winter of 1905 ~ 06 : But Admiral Poe, Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station who visited the Gulf m person, reported to the Admiralty that he saw little'hope of me traffic being suppressed by the British war vessels on the station winch were too large and drew too much water for the purpose, especially as then whereabouts must'always be well known and their movements were carefully watched by the Arabs. During the following season' (1906-07) increased efforts were made bv His Majesty s sh.ps to cope with the trade, but their endeavours were for the most part unsuccessful. By the end of the season the naval officers who had taken the largest share m the operations were satisfied of the pnctical impossibility of checking the arms trade by sea. practicai * As regards the duration of the arms fvaffio « ^ i ■ ^ in 1906, as the result of his observations, tUt the sSson of t™' 1 f 0me ™ lle ' »•*., reported extended from November to March The latest of transporting arms across the Gulf Gulf shows that in 1908, a certain numwS ^ oh the Persian to October, though during the height nf tL /1 111 during the months of Mav t—ted was very amafl.

Mention may be made in this place of the assistance rendered to the Intelligence system organised by Mr. JJ 1 the season of New. 1906-07 by Mr. R. New, Assistant Superintendent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Jask (since appointed Vice-Consul at Lingah), who organised a system of intelligence along the coast by means of telephones and special watchmen to co-operate with His Majesty's ships. It may be added that in the following winter (November 1907) the Government of India adopted a series of measures, at Mr. New's suggestion, for dealing with the traffic on the Mekran coast. These measures included the creation of a small corps of camel sowars to patrol the coast between Jask and Chahbar, in order to collect information about the movements of Afghans, expected consignments of arms, &amp;c., for communication without delay to British ships engaged in the suppression of the trade. The value of Mr. New's work in this connection was fully recognised by the Naval Commander-in-Chief (Admiral Slade), who, in a report dated the 7th May 1909, expressed great appreciation of the ' excellent and reliable service of intelligence,' which Mr. New had organised. 29. One point in connection with naval operations requires special notice. In a Despatch dated the 26th Disposal of captured arms. j llly the Government of India ,u, George Hamilton's Despatch of raised the quest i on 0 f t l le disposal of 9th November 1900. 1 . . -in ;&gt; 48 /00 arms and ammunition captured from ' ' dhows by Her Majesty's ships under the agreement with Muskat. In reply Her Majesty's Government laid down the general principal that ' confiscated arms . . . should be handed over to the Government within whose territories they were seized ' (Letter from Foreign Office to India Office, 29th October 1900); and the Government of India were informed that ' arms seized by the British authorities under ' powers derived from the Government of Muskat should be handed over to ^ the Government on whose behalf and within whose jurisdiction they were ' seized ' (Lord George Hamilton to Government of India, 9th November 1900 )- The same principle was reaffirmed by His Majesty's Government two years later, when Lord George Hamilton Lord George Hamilton s Despatch of informed the Government of India, in 1 1 ' 1)11 ' ' a Despatch dated the 11th April 1902, that ' the Sultan of Muskat is un- ' doubtedly entitled under his agreement to any arms that may be seized ' by His Majesty's ships in Muskat waters, or in a Muskat vessel outside the ' territorial waters of any other Power.' Similarly, as regards Persia, His Majesty's Minister at Teheran was informed that 'any seizures made by ' British ships of war in t'he territorial waters of Persia or in Persian boats ' outside their limits and not within the territorial waters of another country ' should be held to be confiscated for and in the interest of the Persian ' Government ' (Lord Lansdowne to Sir A. Hardinge, 24th March 1902). 30. The following summary of the general situation in respect of the arms traffic in 1907 is taken from a General Summary of Situation, 1907. Memorandum drawn up under the instructions of the Government of India in connection with the Persian Gulf Gazetteer :— 'The present situation is therefore as follows. Since J902 the arms traffic has been nominally prohibited at every port, except Muskat, in the Gulfs of Persia and Oman but smuggling and connivance at breaches of the law are so universally prevalent that arms and ammunition continue to be distributed from Muskat over the length and breadth of the Gulf region, and * With the exception of the El Katr peninsula (see paragraph 15). S. 16. E18 a brisk trade in arms has sprung up between Muskat and Afghanistan. 1 he importations at Muskat, though the small local demand of the Oman Sultanate must lon o ' since have been satisfied, are still on the same sc ale as bt ton tlu general prohibition of the trade in .1902 ; but they now represent the whole, or nearly the whole, instead of a part only of the trade. It has been proved, at the cost of an immense expenditure of eneigy by Ijiitish establishments, that the illegal dissemination of arms from the free port of Muskat cannot be prevented, or even appreciably hindered by naval means ; also that measures, however efficacious, taken in British Baluchistan do not and cannot influence the course of the Afghan traffic; while officers who have studied the question on the spot in Persia agree that the Government of that country are incapable, however much they may desire to do so, of putting down the trade across Persia between Muskat and Afghanistan.' III. Events in 1907-09: The Brussels Arms Conference, 1908-09. 31. In a despatch dated the 21st February 1907 the Government of India i . i -n i « drew attention to the formidable pro- vemment aPP P OTtioils which th « 'IHcit arms traffic Government of India 's letter, 21st ^ the . Pers i i an Gulf _ was assuming. February 1907. Ihey pointed out the injurious eftects 473/07. that were already being produced in Persian and Turkish territory, where the authority of the respective Governments had already been, to a great extent, undermined, and referred to the 'luxuriant crop of'difficulties ' that would be cieated on the North-A\ est frontier of India and in Afghanistan if the facilities enjoved by the tribesmen for obtaining modern arms and ammunition were not checked. They estimated that out of the 270,000 men belonging to the frontier tribes more than one third possessed breech-loading rmed arms [see paragraph 25); and added that so great was the trade in such arms, 'and so completely is it beyond our control, that the time may come withm the next few years when every fighting man will possess a modern weapon. ^ As regards remedial measures, the Government of India were, convinced that nothing could be hoped for from the Persian Government. ' We re^ar It as certain, they wrote ' that effective action for the suppression of'the arms trade cannot be taken by the Persian authorities.

They suggested that, in approaching the 1 rench Government, (1) the ' nature and far-reaching consequences ' of the evil might be explained to them, ' as they are probably not fully known except to ourselves and to the other countries that suffer'; and (2) it might be pointed out that British trade would stand to lose more heavily even than French by the proposed prohibition, more than half the traffic being stili m Jiiiiglish hands. As proposals of secondary importance, a which should certainly not be Subsidiary proposals. u a ^ owe( l to delay action on what we + i + ir • i x &gt;» xi re fe ar( i as the vital question of stopping the trade at Muskat, the Government of India recommended : (1.) That the Muskat Proclamation of 1898 (see paragraph 8 and Appendix V1.) should be revised in such a manner as to cover the export of arms from Muskat, not only to Indian and Persian ports ^ but also to any port whatever in the Persian Gulf.t (2.) That the Muskat Proclamation should be amended so as to enlarge ^ ^ our powers m regard to the seizure of arms. (3. ) That the Turkish Government should be asked to allow British ships of war, 'whether in Koweit waters or in Turkish territorial waters m the Persian Gulf outside the Shatt-el-Arab,' to search vessels suspected of carrying arms, including those flying the Turkish flag. (4.) That, ' in the event, which we trust is unlikely, of its being found ^ impossible to concert measures with France for complete abolition of the aims tiade m the near future, the restriction placed upon British subjects in Muskat in June 1898 [see paragraph 8 and Appendix A III.) should be removed, ' so as to secure the arms tiade iemaming, as far as possible while it exists, in the hands ' of British subjects.' 33. In reply to their Despatch of 21st February 1907, the Government of Mr. Morley 's. Despatch, 29th March India were informed on the 29th March 1907 - t ^ 1907 that His Majesty's Government 4/3 07 - did not consider the present moment opportune for making representations to the Powers concerned, but were of . opinion that the better course would be u to continue for the present the ' collection of information and statistics with a view to bringing the various ' recommendations made by the Government of India before the Arms ' Conference which is to assemble at Brussels early in 1908.' 34. It was hoped that the object in view might be achieved as a result Brussels Arms Conference, 1908. ° f * he B ™ s sel S International Arms Uonierence by some arrangement for bringing Muskat within the scope of the General Act of the Brussels Convention of 1890,J under which the traffic in arms is prohibited on the * It was pointed out that considerable concessions had been made to France in the negotiations arising out of the Hague Arbitration Award of 1904 (respecting the use of the French flag by Muskat dhows), and that a settlement of this question satisfactory to the French Government appeared to be within sight. t This was a revival of the proposal made by the Government of India in 1904 (see above, paragraph 16). The Government of India pointed out that the reasons, based on the state of tribal affairs in Central Arabia, which caused the proposal to be dropped in 1904, no longer held good in 1907, as the Wahabi Amir had established so strong a position as to be independent of indirect aid. | The Brussels Act of 1890 requires any one of the signatory Powers that has occasion to authorise the traffic in arms in territories of its own lying within the regions affected by the provisions of the Act, to establish a ' public warehouse,' under the control of its local adminis tration, in which all imported arms must be deposited, and from which they may not be withdrawn without the previous authorisation of the administration.20 t q„„tv, of I it 9 0 N.

The views of the Government nf India on this point were stated in the Viceroy's telegram of 2nd February 1008 Could «c not,' thgy asked, ''before the Conference meets induce •' France if not any other Powers having commercial treaties with Muskat, ' to agree to amendment of treaties and prohibition of the import ot arms as 'toelower most interested? We would meet the cost ot compensating ' Sultan, and in return for this might induce him, with conseul o I iance, to ' entrust customs management to us, or at any rate to appom a u is ' officer as Superintendent of Customs.' Failing an arrangement of this kind, it was recognised that the question of the Persian Gulf traffic might have to come before the Conference for lull discussion, in which case it was held that the object of His Majesty s Govern ment should be to minimise, as far as possible, the danger ot foreign interference at Muskat. As regards the actual control of the tratiic at Muskat, the Government of India considered that the important point was to get the Sultan to agree to prohibit the importation of arms and ammu nition. ' His consent can be procured when international agreement proposed ' is concluded, but abolition of traffic would involve heavy loss of income ' from customs duties, and, unless he were indemnified for this, he might ' be expected to obstruct passively measures for prevention of arms traffic. ' We would recommend that arrangements for compensation should be ' entrusted to us, as we and Turkey and Persia are main, if not only, ' sufferers from Muskat trade. Payment of subsidy by Powers would be ' calamitous, and would inevitably lead to serious disturbance of status quo. ' Sultan might perhaps be induced to appoint British officer as superin- ' tendent of his customs, in order to ensure effective prohibition of import by thorough customs examination. We are ascertaining what ' sum would be a fair indemnity for Sultan's loss of revenue. Political ' Agent, Muskat, estimates fair indemnity at 12,000Z. a year. :: - Political ' Resident in Persian Gulf thinks that it may be less. 11 In a further telegram, dated the 13th February 1908, the Government of India reported a recommendation by Major Cox that a suitable- compensation to the Sultan for the loss of income entailed by the prohibition of the arms traffic would be to double the subsidy (5,7(iOZ. per annum) he already received from Indian revenues,! and to raise it gradually, as might be necessary, to 15,000L per annum. 35. As a matter of fact no progress was made at Brussels with the Brussels Conference: Negotiations -i Vono 01ll(ireil ^ e with France. e ^th April 1 JOS. On the 2nd . • ^ a y 190S the Italian delegate, Count Bonin, submitted a proposal on behalf of his Cgovernment to extend the • + n 1 / l statement as to the value of the arms and ammunition imported into Muskat and of the Customs revenue from these imports. t Hie circumstance in which a subsidy of 5,760i. per annum was granted to the Sultan ot Muskat were as follows :-On the death ot Sultan Saiyid Said in 1856 a dispute arose between his two somas to the possession of Muskat and Zanzibar, which had hiVrto been uS under the same inler. the question was referred to the Viceroy of India, who decided that the and manifest his friendship towards the British Goverament ' y e,,g4 « eme,l,to21 provisions of the Brussels Act (including such new regulations as might be introduced as a result of the Conference then in session) so as to include the whole of Arabia and the opposite coast of the Persian Gulf, as well as the entire continent of Africa, within the zone of prohibition. The British delegates made a counter-proposal to restrict the zone in Arabia to the Hadramaut and Red Sea coasts, and to exclude the whole of the Gulf littoral, both on the Persian and Arabian side. Sir A. Hardinge, in defending the British proposals (14th May 1908), pointed out that any extension to the Persian Gulf would be futile unless it embraced Muskat, and that the peculiar political and commercial conditions prevailing in the latter State rendered the application of the Brussels Act unsuitable, and made it ' easier to deal with the evil there by circuitous than by direct measures.' The British delegate therefore urged that, as regards Muskat, it would be wiser that the Treaty Powers, whose consent was necessary, should authorise the Sultan to ' take such measures as he deemed possible on his own initiative. On the 22nd May 1908 Count Bonin announced that the Italian Government, ' in a conciliatory spirit and in deference to the objections made by others,' withdrew its proposals to extend the zone of prohibition to the whole of Africa and Arabia, but that this concession, ' in so far as Oman and the *' Persian Gulf were concerned, was conditional upon the acceptance by the ' Conference of the British proposals respecting Muskat.' The British proposals were embodied in a draft article,^ which Sir A. Hardinge laid before the Conference on the 27th May 1908, providing that such of the signatory Powers as had commercial treaties with Oman should not, on the strength of any provisions contained in their treaties, offer opposition to such measures as the Sultan might be disposed to take, with a view to prohibiting the import of arms into, or their export from, his dominions. On the ord June 1908 the Dutch delegate stated that his Government was prepared to orant the Sultan of Muskat full liberty to deal with the arms traffic in Oman, provided that other Powers having treaty rights with His Highness concurred. The United States delegate made a declaration to the same effect. On tlie following day, however, (4th June 1908), the French Delegates announced to the Conference that they could not consent to discuss the Muskat question in Conference, but they intimated confidentially to Sir A. Hardinge that their Government might be willing to negotiate privately withjlis Majesty s Government on the subject. On the 11th June 190b l - l is Majesty s Ambassador at Paris was instructed to approach the Irench Govermnen in the matter. It is not proposed to deal in detail with the negotiations la followed. Brieflv stated, their object was to arrive at an agreement by which, in return for territorial concessions on the part of His Majesty s Government France would abrogate her rights under her Commercial Treaty wuh Muskat of 1844 and the Joint Franco-British Declaration of 1862 (see Appendices and III.), thereby leaving Great Britain a ' free hand at Muskat 1 negotiations proved ineffectual, and were suspended on the 30th April 1909 His Majesty's Government, informally terminating the negotiations expressed ,V) the French Government their great regret at having to acknowledge failure to arrive at a satisfactory settlement of a situation where a few '-nrivate French merchants are enabled to do material damage to the ' External interests of the British Empire by prosecutmg under the ' Treatv of 1844, a trade, in arms which sprang up in 1898. ine Brussels Conference, which was adjourned on the 20th July 1908, and did not reassemble until the 14th December 1909, was hnally dissolved tl Qiot IWpmber 1909. No Convention was signed, the opposition nf 1 France preventing the acceptance of the draft 'Additional Act' pro- posed by the Italian Government, to which all the other Powers were rea .y to agree. * Thp text of the draft article laid before the Brussels Conference by Sir A. Hardinge on i 07+1 nvftiv 1908 was as follows L'experience ayant demontre que le commeice des ' 1 tel au'il se'pratique actuellement a Mascate tend a favoriser I'introduction clandestine j 1 ' u 1 pi pV Afriaue et a y entraver I'oeuvre de paix et de civilisation que poursuivent chacune d'elles, ayant de* Traites de Co^eroe 1 ' T^T n\nwosev aucune disposition de ces Traites aux mesures que Sa Hautesse le - Sultan de Mascate serait dispose a prendre, en vue d'interdire Timportation d armes ou eur reexportation de ses Etats. s. 16. f22 ' 36. In the meanw rhile the arms traffic proceeded vigorously. On the 18th April 1908, H.M.S. 'Proserpine' captured off Ras-el-Kuh, west of Jask, a The Traffic in 1908 09. dhow with 1,500 rifles and ammunition on board. On approaching the shore two days later one of the 'Proserpine's ' boats was fired at, one bluejacket being killed and another wounded. 200 men were subsequently landed from the ' Proserpine ' to protect the Jask station.On the 7th May 1908 the Government of India telegraphed that large quantities of arms and ammu nition (amounting, according to their latest information, to about 12,500 rifles with probably 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition) had already been landed on the Persian coast, and that no adequate arrangements had been made by the Persian Government for intercepting caravans. On the 22nd May 1908 Mr. Marling, the British Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, reported that he had been 'constantly urging' the Persian Government ' to take measures 'to force the caravans to take the route through British Baluchistan, ' where the British Government has a small force in readiness to intercept 'them.' Mr. Marling stated that the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and of the Interior had both promised to do all they could, but that he feared it was hopeless to expect any effective action, as the local authorities were without the funds requisite to raise and pay men for the purpose, and the Central Government was quite unable to furnish them with money. On the 30th. June 1908 tiie Government of Viceroy's telegram of 30th June 1908. India telegraphed a summary of the 1290/08. traffic between the Gulf and Afghanistan during the gun-running season that / ... , had just come to an end. The main caravan (with some 1,000 menf and 900 camels) which reached Afghanistan vm Regan and Nasratabad Ispe on the 8th June 1908 was believed to have ram r M ^ f ^ 2 ^ 0 ?' 000 ^unds of ammunition, all of which , 0111 A f lus V at a ^! were ianded in small boats at various points on the 'fn coast.

A new and unpleasant feature of the season of 1908 was the threatened Af , p , attack made by a party of Afghans m i\r r ^ nan 14 ®I )r J sals - belonging to the main caravan upon the 1908 g re5 '' 16 Indo-European Department's^ Telegraph 3513/08. station at Dehaneh, 0 their avowed object being to kill an Englishman in revenge for having had six men killed on the coast while engaged in the arms traffic. As it happened there was no European official at Dehaneh, and the Afghans, having ascertained this, did not proceed to the telegraph station, but contented themselves with carrying off a native lineman in the employ ment of the Department. The latter was at first reported to have been put to death, but he subsequently escaped from his captors and made his way to Koh-i-Malik Siah. After the caravan had reached Afghanistan in safety, 20 Afghans turned back to take vengeance for the death of their two comrades who had been killed by the Persian troops. {See paragraph 36.) 38. The whole situation was reviewed by Sir A. H. McMahon, Agent to ■n i p . tlie Governor-General in Baluchistan, Proposal for Military Cordon on in a report t0 the Government of India, i-eisian toast. dated the 24th Octobel . 190g He IncMh October ToOS. 0 G0 ~ nt 0f P^ed ont that the preventive measures 2078/08 taken during the past year had been practically ineffectual in checking the smuggling of arms, while they had exasperated the Afghan gnu-runners and made it probable that they would retaliate upon outlying stations of the Indo-European Telegraph Department during the coining season. He considered that only two courses were open to us for the coming season, viz., either— (1.) To abandon all serious attempts at prevention and ccnfine ourselves merely to defensive measures for the protection of telegraph stations, &amp;c. We should thus, he observed, u be saved great expense, trouble, and risk, and the quantity of arms and ammu nition that will reach Afghanistan will be in no way affected f (2.) To adopt preventive measures on a really large scale, both by land and sea, including the establishment of a strong military cordon in Persian territory, either inland through Pobat and Bam (in prolongation of the line held during the previous season on the British side of the frontier, see paragraph 22) or, preferably, along the coast line from Bunder Abbas to Gwettur (over 400 miles). In view of ' the serious danger that threatens the peace of our Indian u frontier from the wholesale armament of our frontier tribes, and the ' trouble which threatens in the future from huge accumulations of ' arms and ammunition in Persian Baluchistan,' Sir A. McMahon felt ' reluctantly compelled ' to recommend the adoption of alternative No. (2), rather than incur the evil effect of even one more arms traffic season. He considered that two regiments of infantry would suffice for the proposed cordon. 39. It was considered, however, that political and financial considerations , x , t i qaq precluded for the present the employ- Viceroy s telegram, 6tn January 1909. . x . , • n • i % 154/09. ment oi troops in Persian territory or any considerable increase of naval activity in the Gulf. The Government of India recommended that naval Lord Morley's telegram, 15th January activity should be continued with the 1909. force available, but no other special 2850 a /09. action taken during the coming season. This course was approved by His Majesty's Government on the 15th January 1909. Arrangements were made at the same time for the temporary withdrawal of the Dehaneh telegraph staff to Koh-i-Malik Siah. * Dehaneh lies some 12 miles to the west of Gerageh, a regular halting-place cn the caravan road between Regan and Seistan. The Afghans wrecked the telegraph line at Gerageh immediately on arriving there.IV. evfxts subsequent to brussels conference i Operations. Naval Blockade 40. On the 2nd September 1909 ^Gov— t of ^ ^ Situation in 1909. After referring to their P rev1 ^^ ' Government of Ma's letter, 2nd Sep- patch ^3^ ^'remarked that tember 1909. l332/09 {he^spension of the negotiations with r '-' -ist ;i5: ' evidence which we have been able to '• h sions w hich we then ' during the past two years proves that Uie apprehension ' expressed were in no way ^^^nttn^anf Nortl^'cst Frontier ' contimied toZuSh .Tnt Vhere has been a steady increase ^ ' of magazine rifles imported, and we have received information that ' CO Thw n ^1nted n out d the^results Vf^the'coiSmied importation had been to reduce the price of rifles on the North-West frontier by about j O pei ccnt., and that the fall in price had been so steady that ' local factories in inde- •' pendent territory no longer find it profitable to manufacture rifles and are ' closing their business.' 41. The result was, in the Government of India's opinion, to produce a situation of cousiderable danger (1) in Afghanistan ; (2) in tribal teuitoi^ on the North-West Frontier ; and (3) in India itself. (1.) In Afghanistan the Amir, it was pointed out, had, for whatever reason,' reversed the policy of his predecessor, and given every encouragement to the import of modern rifles and ammunition into his kingdom. The wholesale arming of the Afghans which had ensued would, the Government of India considered, ' materially increase our difficulties in the event of armed ' intervention whether that be brought about by the hostility of ' the Amir or by anarchy arising from internal rebellion. 11 It may be worth mentioning in this place that early in November 1909 a report was received from Herat to the effect that 70 Afridis had arrived from the Indian frontier and were going to the Persian Gulf as guards for Afghan arms traders. The Afridis left Herat for the Gulf on the 1st November 1909 ; they were provided with passports at Kabul, and were assisted by the Governor of Herat. A second contingent of 30, for whom the Herat Commander-in-Chief stood surety, arrived at Herat on the 3rd November 1909 and left two days later with an Afghan caravan of 40 camels bound for Bunder Abbas. The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan con sidered that the fact of the contingents going so far out of the direct route to the Gulf as Herat, showed that they had been sent to escort a consignment of arms in which the Afghan Government had a personal interest. (2.) In tnhal territory the arming of the tribesmen had been proceeding rapidly {see paragraph 25). The armament return of the frontier tribes showed an increase of 26,000 rifles during the past year. &lt;4 Government of India suggested that the Amir's change of policy might be due to the distrust and suspicion engendered by the A.nglo-Russian Agreement of 31st August 1907 having induced him to prepare for a struggle which he regards as inevitable.' But it is worth noting that this reversal by the Amir of his father's policy in regard to the importation Februarv l^O? 6 ^ r ep or tedby the Government of India in their despatch dated 21st 260 S,X m0nth8 bef0re the Mrlo-Ru.*™ Agreement J s signed. (See25 exclusive of Dir, Swat, and Bajaur, where, it was estimated, the stock of rifles had been increased by 33,500. Consciousness of increased strength might, it was feared, lead to concerted action by the ti ibes on a scale hitherto unknown ; and, consideriug the diffi culties experienced in the past in dealing with tribal risings when the tribesmen were comparatively ill-armed and possessed no great quantity of ammunition, the Government of India could not but regard with apprehension the scale on which future expeditions will have to be conducted, and the expenditure which will be involved when the tribesmen are armed with magazine rifles and have an abundant supply of ammunition. Already, it may no noted, the militia corps have lost much of the superiority which better arms and more abundant ammunition gave them in the past, and which enabled them to cope successfully with I' raiding bands of greater numerical strength ; and raiders have shown a tendency to conduct their operations with increasing 1 boldness and in organised gangs of l greater strength than hitherto, io deal with these gangs parties of fifty or sixty men have now to be sent out where twelve or fourteen were formerly ' sufficient.' (3.) In India itself there was a danger that the Xorth-West frontier might become 'a possible source from which the forces of sedition in internal India will obtain supplies of arms and ammunition.' To sum up, the Government of India considered that a political and military situation had arisen in Afghanistan and on the North-West frontier ' which has upset the balance of power, and constitutes a serious ' menace to the maintenance of peace. The gravity of the position is such ' as, in our judgment, to call for immediate and effective action, and ' we can no longer safely afford to await the uncertain issues of diplomacy. ' We are strongly of opinion that any reasonable means and expenditure ' having for their aim the suppression of this traffic will not only prove economical in the end, but are imperatively demanded to avert a danger which, if permitted to increase, may seriously embarrass our position in « India.' 12. The Government of India then proceeded to discuss the question of remedial measures, and to consider the practicability of action (I) in Afghanistan, (2) at Muskat, (3) in Persia and on the Mekran coast, and (4) in the Persian Gulf. Of these alternative courses they rejected all but the last. (1.) As regards Afghanistan, the Amir's attitude was considered to be such as to preclude all hope that he would consent to give us control of the supply of arms to Afghanistan. (2.) As regards Muskat, the Political Agent (Mr. Holland) had suggested, in a letter dated the 4th April 1909,' :i: ' that some effort shoidd be made to secure the Sultan's co-operation in suppressing the traffic. Mr. Holland recognised that the time was not yet ripe for considering the larger question of a permanent increase of the Sultan's subsidy as compensation for the loss of customs revenue, in the event of the Brussels Conference (then in session) resulting in the prohibition of the import of arms into Muskat. But he suggested that it might be worth while ' to negotiate on similar ' lines with his Highness in order to secure his co-operation solely ' in connection with the prevention of export to the Mekran coast. ' If so, while the strength of our own position with reference to ' the Sultan's failure to fulfil his obligations should not be forgotten, and should even be revealed to his Highness at the ' diplomatic moment, we might perhaps be prepared to purchase ' his assistance in stopping the export by a payment of, say, ' 5,000 rupees a month (4,000L a year). In return for this the ' Sultan should be required to take measures to prevent, from June * Enclosure No. 1 in Government of India's letter of 2nci September 1909. S. 16. G20 ' the end of this arms season, onwards, all exports fiom Oman ' SS Wearly understood that the ardent ' was purely temporarv, and that it would be abrogated bj a ' wide? and entirely independent agreement to be concluded u lotpr if Dossible for tlio cibolition C)t impoit. Neither the Resident in the Persian Gulf nor the (.ovemment of India considered Mr. Holland's suggestion practicable Major Cox pointed out that the Sultan had ' absolutely no iiiacluneiy for effectively preventing exports from Oman to Mekran, and that it was never supposed that he could A lb ov ' I 1 , 0 coast' against the export of arms. Major Cox added that as ' long as the import remains legitimate there would be notliing to ' prevent a foreign merchant like Goguyer from receiving his ' consignments from the steamer into dhows in the harbour and ' sending the latter off to some other port in Oman which he could ' make his headquarters.' i i t i Mr. Holland, it should be added, afterwards explained (bth July 1909) that what he contemplated was, 'not that His iliglmess ' should takft active steps to blockade his own line of coast, which ' would be beyond the bounds of possibility, but that he should ' render us assistance, which would be well within his power, in 'enforcing the blockade of the Mekran coast. lie had never contemplated that the Sultan's co-operation would do away with the necessity for action on our part on the Mekran coast, so long as the importation of arms into Muskat continued. But he believed that the Sultan, if it was made worth his while, could assist our blockade very materially by letting it be known locally that he was opposed to the traffic to Mekran, by employing his numerous spies to inform against his subjects engaged in the trade, by punishing the crews of dhows seized by British ships, and by generally signifying his displeasure with the gun-runners. Major Cox, however, still found himself unable to support Mr. Holland's recommendations, and remarked that his own inclination was in favour of ' first showing the Sultan that we can ' and will make the blockade effectual, and then of paying him ' whatever seems fair for the loss of revenue which we see ' resulting to him.' The Government of India concurred with Major Cox, and thought that an arrangement such as that proposed by Mr. Holland would ' raise more difficulties than it would settle, and would not improbably be ineffectual.' (3.) As regards the third alternative mentioned above, viz., that of measures on the Coast of Persia, the Government of India were doubtful whether ' military action along the Persian littoral would yield results commensurate with the expenditure involved.' They recognised, moreover, that such action ' would appear to be &lt;( P rec l ll( ^ e( ^ by ^e conditions of the present political situation in 1 ersia, and our treaty obligations.'* 43. There remained the last of the four alternatives referred to in the Proposals for a Naval Blockade .t preceding paragraph, that of naval 4. . i /-&gt;, action in the Persian Gulf.

Admiral Slade estimated that four second or third class cruisers would be required for this service, so that one vessel might always be away coaling and resting, while the other three were actively employed in blockading the coast. I wo out of the four vessels could be supplied from the East Indies Station, but the two others must be specially detailed for the woik- Admiral Slade added that it would be necessary for all four ships to be fitted with wireless telegraphy, and that ' it would add greatly to the efficiency of the blockade if the Government of India would sanction and erect the proposed wireless station at Jask.' The Admiral also recom mended the reinforcement of the J ask guard, :i: ' to protect the station from possible reprisals by land, and the posting at the same place of a trained Intelligence officer. Admiral Slade felt confident that, if the measures proposed by him were adopted, it ought to be possible to stop a large proportion of arms going through. Every dhow approaching the coast would be searched night and day, and, with a capable officer in charge of the blockade, ' the price of arms on the Afghan frontier ought to rise two or three hundred per cent.' The blockade should, in the Admiral's opinion, last from the 1st January to the end of April. 44. The Government ol: India expressed their full concurrence in Admiral Slade's proposals, but considered that, to be effective, the blockade should be maintained for a full year and should be started with the least -possible delay. They also referred to the question of cost, and expressed the view that, under the terms of the Welby Commission's Report, ' the cost of any naval measures outside the fixed contribution which India now pays should ' fall on the Imperial Government.' In conclusion the}^ reaffirmed their opinion as to the necessity of coming to some arrangement with France, by which His Majesty's Government w T ould secure a free hand to take action at Muskat. 45. A subsequent report from Mr. Holland, dated the I3th September _ ^ . 1909, showed that the import of arms Arms Depots on Mekran Coast. ail( j ammim itioii into Mekran was pro- 1531/09. ceeding with great rapidity,! and that arms depots were apparently being formed along the coast, which, if the smuggling continued unchecked, would, in a few weeks 'contain sufficient arms to satisfy Afghan caravans for the whole of the cold weather.' As regards these depots. Admiral Slade stated, in a letter to the Government of India, dated I9th November 1909, that 'it appears that the arms ' which are landed on the Persian coast are never taken far inland at ' once, but are stored in the villages 4350/09. u a f ew m iles of the places at ' which they are disembarked.' The Admiral added that he had, at the moment of writing, information as to the whereabouts of some 0,000 rifles and corresponding ammunition. 46. The Government of India's proposals were communicated to the T t ^ i. Foreign Office in Sir R. Ritchie's letter n^w a i909 ce gI1 of the 15th October 1909, with the 1332/09. recommendation that ' an effective naval blockade should be undertaken at once ' ; it was also suggested that ' a series of short raids by boats' crews upon the Mekran depots described by Mr. Holland ' might be a feature of the operations. * See paragraph 58. • i i i t Mr. Holland reported that 3,000 rifles and 212,000 rounds of ammunition had been imported during the past month, as compared with 645 rifles and 69,000 rounds of ammunition daring the corresponding period of 1908.28 17 Roth the Foreign Office and the Admiralty agreed to the proposed 4/.

The naval proposals were further supplemented by Admiral Slade in a letter to the Government of India, dated 19th November 1909. lie con sidered that ' to make the utmost use ' of our sea power we ought to follow '• np the operations afloat by action on cargoes which escape our boats shall ' eventually fall into our hands.' The force required for this purpose would not be large, but some reinforcement of the ships' crews would be desirable in view of the severe work entailed. lie therefore recommended that the marines should be reinforced by troops embarked for the purpose, and conveyed in a separate ship fitted np as a transport. In order to preserve to the contingent ' its character of being a naval force,' it would be under the direct command and authority of the senior naval othcer on the spot, and would always comprise a certain number of sailors. As regards the nature of the action contemplated, Admiral Slade explained that ' no occupation ' of Persian territory would be involved, for I do not propose to do more than ' raid any village in which arms are stored, or follow up any cargo which ' has been landed so as to seize the arms and ammunition, and then to ' re-embark the men at once. The utmost time that they would be on shore ' would probably not exceed two or three days.' 49. In a telegram dated the 19th November 1009 the A iceroy informed Viceroy's telegram of 19tli November the Secretary of State that he had iro , personally discussed the situation with , , ' ' , . the Naval Commander-in-Chief, and that they both agreed that it was ' important to land parties to make good subSTp rC'^' 0 peU' P ' tr^ e r ged ^Woelcde, ™r.- The ('Philomel'') Tn arWu/irm + ' , Proserpine ), and one additional vessel ready before the end^f C'fi 0 r VeS8el8 J ! 0dm and ' ^rt') would be detailed and kept up from the Bij-abal a COnt ™ 8 bIock ^ to Pe tH^L»reSi5 in the additional ships, ' Philomel ' 'Odin' ami ' \i s ^ bsidl f ed ships, in respect of the three paragraph 54 (note).

' v As regards the diplomatic aspect of this proposal, His Majesty's Minister at lenran, after discussing the question with Major Cox, reported on the . () member 1909 that he did not think a land cordon of troops desirable, as it would delay the withdrawal of Russian troops in the north, but he saw no objection to the temporary landing of bluejackets. In the event of complaints from the Persian Government, he thought His Majesty's Govern- ment would have a strong case. He thought it would be useless to try to obtain effective co-operation from Persia. 50. On the 4th December 1909 the Government of India reported that wire jess apparatus was being temporarily erected at Jask, and that Major lb I!. Austin, G.M.G., was being sent to that port as Intelligence Officer. \\ neless communication between Jask and the ships in the Gulf was opened on the -1th December 1909. The question of the arrangements for a permanent wireless station at Jask is under consideration. 51. It will be convenient in this place to give some account of captures of arms effected in Captures of Arms, ITovembsr—De- November and December 1909 before cember 1909. the commencement of the blockade proper. On the 5th November 1909, II.M.S. ' Fox ' captured a Persian dhow named ' Badil ' in Lima Bay, on the Oman coast, with about 1,300 rifles and 119,000 rounds of ammunition on board. The dhow flew no flag, and no papers were found on board. On the 3rd December 1909 the Naval Commander-in-Chief reported the capture by H.M.S. 'Fox,' on the high seas, of a Persian dhow, the ' Khairi,' manned by Persians, and carrying 419 rifles, 84 pistols, and 220,000 rounds of TT „ , _ „ T ammunition. The 'Khairi' carried Mr. Holland to ( jo vera men t of India, n i ^ -u i n 16th January 1910. no flag or papers but had a pass from ggj /^q the bultan of Muskat holding good for territorial waters only. Part of the cargo was consigned to merchants in Persia and part to El Katr. Two further seizures, both on the high seas, were reported by Admiral Slade early in December 1909 ;—(1) On the 4th December 1909, H.M.S. ' Lapwing ' captured a dhow flying no colours, but having 1,708 rifles and 211,000 rounds of ammunition on board. The dhow sank while being towed; (2) On the 6th December 1909, H.M.S. ' Philomel' captured a dhow from Muskat with Afghan owners on board, but flying no colours, containing 824 rifles and 5(5,200 rounds of ammunition. This dhow sank as she was cleared, the ' Philomel ' having previously fired on her to stop her. Total captures November—December 1909 :—4,251 rifles, 84 pistols, and 606,200 rounds of ammunition. Admiral Slade recommended that the cargoes taken from the last three dhows captured, which w r ere 4310/09. seized on the high seas, and not (as in the case of the ' Badil ') in Maskat waters, should be destroyed, as it was thought that destruction would have a great effect upon the arms traffic. In reply, the Admiral was instructed as follows by the Admiralty on the f 14Lh December 1909 :—' As there was no 4340/09. ^ ' clear indication of nationality of dhows, ' India Office consider that serviceable portion of their cargoes should be ' retained, it being left to the discretion of the local authorities what portion ' should be destroyed for the sake of public example. The captured dhow ' and crew T , together with crews of sunk dhows, should be kept at Jask ' until the end of the season. Arrange accordingly if you see no objection, ' but Navy should not be responsible for custody of dhow, arms, or crew.'*' * See Appendix XIV. '(pp. 56-57) for table giving particulars as to all seizures between November 1909 and April 19l0, and as to disposal of captured arms. S. 16. h30 The Government of India were informed of the issue ol these instructions in Lord Morley's telegram of the 16th December 1900. 52 Apart from the question of the incidence of the nost of the blockade, as to which there was a sharp division Disposal of Captured Arms. 0 £ opinion between the Admiralty and the Government of India, the principal difficulty lay in the question of the disposal of captured arms and ammunition. The orders issued by His Majesty's Government in 1900, and repeated in 1902, have already been quoted in this Memorandum {see paragraph 29). Briefly stated, they required all seizures made in territorial waters to be handed over to the government in whose territorial waters the dhow was captured, and all seizures made on the high seas to be handed over to the government of the country to whom the captured dhow belonged. In a telegram dated Viceroy's telegram of 27th December Deceilibei 1 JO.) the GoNcrn- 1909. ' ' ment of India stated that, after 1731/09. considering the whole question in Council, they held that 'it would be useless to undertake a costly blockade ' scheme as long as the present arrangements with Persia and Muskat ' as to disposal of captures continue.' They cited the case of the dhow ' Badil,' captured oft' the Oman coast on the 'jth November 1909 (see paragraph 51), and reported that the Sultan claimed the return of the arms taken on board the dhow, on the ground that seizure within Muskat limits was improper, as the ' Badil' had a pass on board which, if found, would prove that the arms were not intended for export to Persia. The Government of India added that, according to a later report from the Political Agent at Muskat, the Sultan was pressing for a reply and was exasperated at the delay in returning the arms, regarding their detention as an ' insult to his authority as a ruler.' r l he Government of India also referred to the case of the ' Khairi ' (see paragraph 51) as another instance in which the Sultan had raised an objection, claiming the portion of the cargo consigned to El Katr, although the dhow was not a Muskat boat, and was not captured in Muskat waters. Ihe Sultan's attitude in regard to these incidents showed, in the Government of India's opinion, that, despite his proclamation of 1898, he ' is evidently an active accomplice of arms _ traders ; and they added that there was a ' consensus a f opinion that any arms restored by us to Sultan would find their way baek to the owner.' As regards Persia, the Government of India presumed that in the present disordered state ' of the country, the Persian Govern ment was interested in checking the illegal importation of arms. They .. ® r ^ ore u r f&lt;l that the Persian Government should be pressed 'to give us ' rv' 0 ro y s ' lcl captured arms and ammunition as under existing be obtaS to'Z^ OTerand if Persia's agreement could ' bear upon the SnVl'''7'\ l |' i str0I1 ^ ] P ressure might then be brought to ' the rX t rwlr of Musk ft'and we nught insist on his granting us Subject fo arran^mentshp' 8 f nniu, ; ltl0 1 n consigned to Persia or India.' of Indirwere' rfnvnt^ T indicated, the Government 'supplemented by Naval Commander'inPh 7 / Cherae ' P ara g ra P h 47 ) to strengthen landinrmrtieTrr I' e t S prOp0Sal t0 em P lo y troo P s {see paragraph 48).

It seems better to deal with each case on its merits as it arises. In case of ' Badii' and similar cases, Sultan should be informed that we are prepared to give arms to him eventually, but in meantime will keep them for him until we are satisfied that there is no chance of their returning to dealers. In case of ' Khairi ' and similar cases, he should be informed that his claim is untenable and cargo should be destroyed. W hen a dhow is captured in Muskat wateis and her papers are in order, but there are good priTna facie grounds for believing that she is engaged in illegitimate traffic, she may be detained pending further enquiry. Sultan being at once informed ; if result of enquiry satisfactory she must be released, if not cargo may be retained for eventual restoration to Saltan. Similar procedure should be followed with Muskat dhows captured outside Muskat waters if circumstances make destruction unadvisable. In dealing with Sultan it should be explained to him that our intention is not to make him suiter pecuniarily.' The Government of India rather demurred to the last proposal (viz., assurance that the Sultan should not suffer pecuniarily), and expressed the hope (in their telegram of 12th January 1910) that this question might lie over. Meanwhile, the Political Agent at Muskat was instructed that if the Sultan himself referred to the subject, ' he should be told that the question of pecuniary loss will be referred to Government of India.' These instruc tions were approved by the Secretary of State on the 4th February 1910, subject to a warning as to the importance of not throwing the Sultan into the arms of the French, or ' exasperating him to point of withdrawing authority he has given us to search dhows.' In the same telegram (1st January 1910) the Secretary of State suggested that, in order to ' close whole coast of Gulf outside Oman,' it might be possible to persuade the Chief of Nejd to prohibit the import of arms. The Government of India considered, however, that no useful purpose would be served by approaching the Nejd Chief, who appeared to have 'no effective jurisdiction on the coast.' Commencement of Blockade: Instruc tions to Admiral. Viceroy's telegram 1910. of 12th January 54. On the 6th January 1910 the Government of India were further instructed that the blockade, if still considered essential, should begin at once, the question of the incidence of its cost :: - being left for future settlement. Accordingly on the 11th January 1910, the following instructions were issued to the Naval Commander-in-Chief :— ' Government of India sanction blockade on lines originally proposed by you, including use of eight launches, but in view of serious financial position here desire to know whether you could not carry out operations * The cost of the Blockade was estimated as follows in the Viceroy's telegram of 17th January 1910:— For 4 months :— Home Indian Army Marine For 12 months :— Home Indian Army Marine - Total £ 57,260 13,273 21,613 92,146 166,574 25,300 58,106 Total 249,980effectively without reducing troops but without employing transport S p vh ch is very costly.

As regards rumour ol ■ reported impending attacks on Chahbar, Government of India must leave it to local naval authorities in conimunication v. itli olhcei coiiimanding troops on the spot to take necessary action, but raids inland should be limited to purpose of seizing arms stored m villages. Alghans should not be attacked unless they are engaged in removing arms or actually threatening Jask or Chahbar. The whole position must be reviewed in April owing to pressure of financial situation, and Government of India are confident that Your Excellency will exercise every economy compatible with efficiency. The employment of a transport was subsequently sanctioned, R.I.M. &lt;&lt; Hardmge ' being used for the purpose. K.I.M. jVImto was detailed ioi service as Depot ship. Attitude of Persian Government. Sir G. Barclay to Sir E. Grey, 29tli January 1910. 2914/10. Viceroy's telegram 1st February 1910. 218/10. 55. As regards Persia, Sir G. Barclay, the British Minister at Tehran telegraphed on the 29th January 1910, with reference to a successful raid on an arms depot in the Jask hinterland {sec paragraph 57), which had just been reported by the naval authorities, that he presumed that the treatment prescribed in the Agreement of 1897 {see para graph 7 and Appendix V.) in respect of arms seized in Persian waters k&lt; should apply a fortiori to arms seized on Persian soil.' lie pointed out that the Persian Government would doubtless lose no time in presenting a claim for compensation in respect of the recent captures, and submitted that if the Government of India were not prepared to pay, in future cases orders should be given that ' arms captured on Persian soil should be held at the disposal of the Persian Government.' The Government of India demurred altogether to Sir G. Barclay's proposal^ pointing out that— ' It is owing to impotence of Persian Government that Afghan gim- luuners have threatened our telegraph stations and fired on our boats, and that we have been forced to undertake very expensive, measures. I ersian Government have no officer on Mekran coast to whom arms could be safely entrusted, and could not reasonably expect us to transport the contraband to Bunder Abbas or Bushire. It seems to us t iat there is a very strong case against compensation, and we could put in many counter claims.' 56.

The naval authorities lost no time in giving effect to the Government of Captures of Arms January-May f 8 orders of the 11th January 1910 1910. {see paragraph 54), and the blockade put mt0 operation without delay.33 H.M.S. 'Perseus' had already (on the 1st January 1910) landed a party at Pishkan, the westernmost point of the Gwadnr enclave on the Mekran coast (belonging to Muskat), and effected a capture of 850 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. The arms, &amp;c., were destroyed. On the 16th January a raid was made by a force consisting of 95 men from H.M.S. ' Fox,' and some 50 sepoys upon a depot at Geigan in the neighbourhood of Jask. 1,350 rifles and 160,000 rounds of ammunition were destroyed. No Afghans were encountered. On the 23rd January a party from the ' Philomel' captured ^0,000 rounds of ammunition in a disused fortress near Bunji, a few miles to the west of Jask. On the night of the 26th January a force w T as landed from the ' Hardinge' (which had arrived at Jask that day) and the 'Hyacinth' to find and destroy an arms depot believed to be established on the Jagin river in Mekran. After a march of 7.V hours the depot was found guarded by a party of Afghans. The latter were driven out of a sangar in a strong position, and 750 rifles and carbines, together with some 50,000 rounds of ammunition, were destroyed. Three Afghans were killed ; there were no British casualties. On the 24th April 1910, H.M.S. 'Philomel' captured at sea two dhows bound for Bunji with a cargo of 1,998 rifles, 158 pistols, and 907,000 rounds of ammunition. These arms, &amp;c., were destroyed 'as a public example, in consequence of the recrudescence of the traffic in arms ' {see paragraph 75). On the 6th May 1910 the Sheikh of Koweit handed over to the Political Agent a consignment of 301 rifles and 30,100 ^rounds of ammunition, which had been landed at Koweit by a dhow (the ' Fateh-el-Khair') flying the French flag. Finally, on the 25th May 1910, H.M.S. ' Perseus ' captured a dhow, 13 miles from Maidani, carrying 2,260 rifles, 50 pistols and 270,000 rounds of ammunition. Total captures between 1st January and 31st May 1910 :—7,519 rifles, 208 pistols, and I,537,100 rounds of ammunition. To this list may be added the case of the ' Muzaffa,' a Koweit dhow which was boarded by H.M.S. 'Hyacinth' in Muskat waters on the 27th January 1910. This dhow, which had a cargo of arms and ammunition consigned for Koweit, was eventually allowed to continue her voyage, _ as there were no grounds for supposing her cargo to be intended for Persian territory {see paragraph 63). A table giving particulars as to all seizures effected in the Persian Gulf from November 1909 to May 1910, and as to the disposal of the captured arms and ammunition, is printed as Appendix XIV. (pp. 56-57). 58. Precautions against reprisals by Gun-runners. Jask and Chalibar guards. Chahbar had a normal guard of A few words may be said as to the measures taken to provide against reprisals by Afghan gun-runners on the stations of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Southern Persia. Prior to 1908 the telegraph stations at Jask and v ^. 52 men each. In April 1908, owing to the threatening attitude of the Afghans engaged in the arms traffic, the J ask guard was temporarily reinforced by 50 men under a British officer.^ A similar temporary reinforcement was authorised in November 1908,t and again in November 1909. In December 1909 it was decided to reinforce the Chahbar guard by 100 men under a British officer. In the same month the Government of India proposed to send a further detachment of 100 men to Jask, thus bringing up the strength of the guard at that place to about 200 men. This increase, in view of reports of Afghan activity received from the Intelligence Officer, Jask, was approved by His Majesty's Government on the 20th December 1909, but, under subsequent orders, the despatch of the men was held in abeyance pending further developments. On the 18th January 1910 the Government of India were authorised to despatch the additional 100 men ' if and when you think necessary.' On the 17th February 1910, owing to the truculent behaviour of the Afghans in the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas, His Majesty's Government sanctioned the reinforcement of * Reinforcement withdrawn in June 1908. t Reinforcement withdrawn in June 1909.34 the Consular guard-at that place by 00 men under a Imtibh oflicei On the 27tli February 1010 the Government of India telegiaphed .

It was decided to maintain the Jask and Chahbar garrisons, foi llit' I uih 1 Ix mg, &lt;it the ii ( xistmg strenoths. The ' Hardinge ' was eventually authorised to return to Bombay on the 1st April 1910. As regards the protection of telegraph stations in the interior, the special , . reinforcement of 500 men sent to Uobat Robat garrison. . . t nno . i 0 .-)x m April 1908 [see paragraph JJ) was withdrawn in the following autumn. But the double company of Native Infantry (about 200 men) which had been posted to Robat in 1900 (see para graph 22, footnote) was still retained. In January 1909 the further temporary retention of this force was sanctioned by His Majesty's Government with a view to the protection of the telegraph staff between Bam and Robat against attacks by Afghan gun-runners. On the 30th March 1909 the Government of India were authorised to withdraw the detachment at the close of the gun- oo. r aq running season. On the 29th April 1909 the British Minister at Tehran telegraphed that he presumed the removal of the troops from Robat was only until the beginning of the next season. Otherwise, Sir G. Barclay considered that the position of the Indo-European Telegraph Department would be very difficult, as, without troops at Robat, the telegraph staff at Dehaneh would 'have nothing nearer to fall back on in case of 683/09. necessity' than Kerman. Sir G. n p T ' i • i , Barclay was informed in reply bv the Government of India that the ' possibility of having to send troops period- £( lca y to Itohat had been foreseen, and question would be considered before commencement of next arms traffic season.'

On the ord February 1010, Mir Barkat had an interview with Admiral Slade, 396/10 on ^ )oar{ ^ tf 16 letter's flagship at Jask, ^ during which he promised to do all in his power to help in the suppression of the arms trade, and to use his influence with other Chiefs along the coast by writing to them and advising them to see the Admiral. But his professions were regarded with suspicion, and on the 9th March 1910, on representations from the British authorities, Mir Barkat was deported from Jask by the Darya Begi, the Persian Governor, and was taken by the latter to Bunder Abbas, where he made an ineffectual attempt to escape. The Darya Begi informed the British Consul at Bunder Abbas, on the 13th March 1910, that he would like to receive approval from Tehran to Barkat's deportation and orders as to his further detention. Major Trevor asked the British Minister at Tehran to endeavour to arrange this with the Persian Government, with the result that Barkat was despatched to Bushire at the end of March. GO. On the 3rd February 1910, in view of reports that had appeared in the public press, it was thought advisable to warn the Government of India of the desirability ' for obvious reasons,' of giving the least possible publicity to the capture of arms in Persian territory. 61. On the Ith February 1910, the Government of India reported that Position of Bahrein and Koweit. ^ ie arms dealers were beginning to Viceroy's telegram of 4th February 1910. ^ m0V . e their arms from Muskat to 00 ^ 10 Ivoweit, and that the Admiral strongly urged that the Sheikh's proclamation of 24th May 1900 {see paragraph 13 and Appendix IX.), should be made widely known, and that the Sultan of Muskat should be asked to include Koweit dhows within the scope of his proclamation of January 1898 {see paragraph 8 and Appendix AT.). Both the Admiral and Major Trevor, the acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, considered it essential to search Koweit dhows, and to confiscate the arms and ammunition found on board them. Subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government, the Government of India proposed to issue orders ' that action may be taken under the ' Koweit proclamation outside Muskat territorial waters at once, and within ' those waters if Sultan of Muskat will issue necessary proclamation ; also ' that action be taken under Bahrein and Trucial Chiefs' proclamation and notifications' {see paragraphs 10 and 14 and Appendices YII. and X.). These proposals were approved by His Majesty's Government on the 17th February 1910. Major Trevor was instructed on the 20th February 1910 to warn Koweit of the intended action. He reported on Major Trevor to Government of India, ^ ie March 1910 that the decision of 8th March 1910. ^ Government had been communicated to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein. In a letter dated the 2nd March 1910 the Sheikh of Koweit had notified his readiness to abide by his proclamation, denied that any of his subjects were interested in the arms traffic, and promised to punish any Koweit nakhoda who should disobey his orders and ship arms and ammunition. Sheikh Mubarak added that he was prepared to give effect to any orders the British Government might give. i:: ' As regards Bahrein, Major Trevor reported that * As regards the attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit, it may be remarked that on the 11th May 1910 the Resident, Persian Gulf, reported that a dhow (the ' Fateh-el-Khair ') flying the French flag, and purporting to belong to the Goguyer firm, reached Koweit on the 27th April 1910 with a cargo of about 400 rifles and 40,000 rounds of ammunition. According to Sheikh Mubarak, the arms were brought in contravention of his prohibition, and landed in defiance of his orders. But the Sheikh's attitude was regarded as insincere, as he was believed to have retained 100 rifles for himself, and to have allowed the dhow to leave Koweit. On the 6th May 1910, after much pressure, he decided to confiscate the cargo from Goguyer's Agent, and delivered it to the Political Agent at Koweit. The actual quantity made over to the Political Agent was 301 rifles and 30,100 rounds of ammunition.I ■ — ♦ ij^ - ■' II 36 qi Mi T ] vl( \ sent the following telegram on Oth ]\Iarch H'lO to Ins Agent 1 nt '' Kimilv warn nohhodas of Bahrein ships never to carry arms eHher to'Bahrrin ^r^elsewhere.

Major Trevor added that a warning had also been conveyed to the Trucial Chiefs. 62 In the same telegram (4th February 1910), the Government of India at the instance ot Major Trevor, revived the suggestion (sec paiagiaph „ that an agreement should be concluded Position of - 8h w ifh Turkey 'authorising action against ' dhows which fly Turkish Flag in 6 3114/10.

He feared that a request of the kind ' would certainly be met by a polite refusal, probably coupled with a promise ' that the Porte itself would send vessels to assist His Majesty s naval forces ' in the suppression of the trade. Supposing that some effort were made to ' carry out this promise, whicli is more than problematical, it most unlikely ' that anything effectual would be done, wlnlc! ihcic would I k the seiious nsk ^ that the officers commanding the Turkish vessels would be apt to extend ' their activities to vessels belonging to subjects ut native clneN uiulci ' our protection, and so raise a number ol questions. In view of Sir G. Lowther's observations. His Majesty's Government decided not to raise the question 'until traffic in Turkish dhows becomes serious,' and the Government of India were informed accordingly on the 21st March 1910. Pending the reference to Constantinople, the Government of India had ox ^ x ui ir x been instructed (17th Februarv 1910) Status oi LI Katr dhows. , r.V n • i n i i , ^ n 7 that 1 urkish dhows sliouid not be 540 / 10 - interfered with. Admiral Slade, in a telegram dated the 28th February 1910, enquired whether these orders applied to dhows belonging to El Katr and flying the Turkish colours, and whether such dhows should be held to be Turkish, and therefore exempt from seizure or interference. In reply, the Admiral was instructed by the Government of India, on the 9th March 1910, that the prohibition of His Majesty's Government was understood to apply only to dhows ' coining from recognised Turkish territory,' and that dhows belonging to El Katr, even if flying the Turkish flag, might be seized if engaged in the illicit arms traffic, but that any arms or ammunition found on board them should not be destroyed without first referring to the Government of India. The Foreign Office, who were consulted informally on this point, expressed the view (in a demi-official letter dated the 14th April 19] 0) that the Government of India's instructions to Admiral Slade were right, as lurkish sovereignty over El Katr had never been recognised by His Maiesty's Government The caution was, added, however, that ' our naval officers' can „ onl y boa ] rd a v 1 esse I 1 fl ying Turkish colours at their own risk, and must be .

The dhow had no ship's papers, but she belonged to Koweit and her cargo of arms and ammunition was consigned from M. Goguyer's firm to a Koweit merchant. The nakhoda possessed a pass signed by the Sultan of Muskat authorising the transport of arms and ammunition within his territorial limits. After a careful inquiry by the Political Agent, the dhow was allowed to continue her journey on the ground that their was no reason to suppose that the cargo was intended foi lersian territory. Ihe Sultan of Muskat was informed accordingly. M. Goguyer's Agent took up the position that, on the strength of his conditional contract with the nQJiJioda, the dhow became his property on its seizure by a man-of-war, and he preferred a claim, through the French Consul at Muskat, for compensation* from His Majesty's Government, including the cost of the dhow and the Ivoweit valuation of the arms, of which he now declined to take delivery. He also brought a charge that one of the dhow's crew had been wounded by a British sailor, and accused the ' Hyacinth's ' men of stealing certain baskets of sweetmeats from the dhow. The French firm's representative told Mr. Holland at the same time that he was prepared to fight us in every possible way; that the Sultan's proclamation was waste paper in view of the French treaty, and that he would press this point on the French Government, and would in the mean while export arms to any place he wished, and hold the British Government responsible for any losses he might sustain. The French Consul, in sub mitting Goguyer's claim, asked for recognition on the grounds (1) that it was based on a French treaty still in force ; and (2) that the French Government had not concurred in the restrictive measures introduced by the Sultan. 04. The Government of India reported this incident in full in their telegram the 13th February 1910. Thev ^Viceroy'., telegram of 13th February pointed ^ j hat) as tlle dhow belonged 29310. t0 Koweit, it was for the Sheikh of Koweit, if for anybody, to protest against her detention and the alleged wounding of one of her crew, and that M. Goguyer's agent had no locus standi in the matter. The agent's claim that the dhow became his property on her seizure could not be allowed, and was, in any case, not specifically supported by the French Consul. In these circumstances they proposed to instruct Mr. Holland to reply to the French Consul that ' Government are unable to recognise that ' Goguyer has any claim to compensation from us for the temporary ' detention of his goods, or for the trifling damage caused to two packages ' which were opened for examination, in default of a bill of lading.' The proposed instructions to Mr. Holland were approved by His Majesty's Government in Lord Morlej^'s telegram r U a. L0 19W 0rley ' 8 telegram of 17th Feb ' of the 17th February 1910. At the 1 } ' 2984/10. same time the G-overnment of India were instructed to warn naval officers ' to avoid seizures in Muskat waters lest French get hold of a really good case against us.' Mr. Holland telegraphed on the 26th February that the French Consul was referring the matter to his Government, and that Goguyer's Agent was leaving for Paris to press his claim. 65. In a later telegram dated the 22nd February 1910 the Government of India reported that, according to infor- ^ Viceroy's telegram of 22nd February ma tion received by telegraph from the 1910 ' 330/10 Political Agent at Muskat, Goguyer's representative had purchased a dhow, and had ' despatched her for Katr laden with arms and ammunition under ' the flag of the French Government, and that the French Consul confirmed * The total amount claimed was 123,125 francs (4,925Z.), including 5,000 francs (200Z.) for the value of the dhow. S. 16. K38 ' tho report of the purchase in reply to request to exchange list of (ll.ows.'» Mr Holfaud added that Gognycr was negotiating for the pnrchasc of aiiother dhow, and that, according to the —ut of he intended to establish Agents wherever possible on the Arabian coast, a view to extending his business. 66. Meanwhile the Sultan of Muskat being according to the report of the Political Agent, convinced that hiitisli Overtures of Sultan of Muskat. ' Government intend to suppress arms Mr. Holland to Government of India, •' traffic,' 1 had liillted to Mr. Holland 19tli January 1910. that he would l)e prepared to revoke 248/10. his licenses, and to prohibit the im portation of arms and ammunition into Oman, on condition that the biitish Government would agree (1.) To compensate him for the loss of revenue ; (2.) To support him against the French Government 01 nn\ othei 1 ower that might object to his action ; (3.) To arrange for the purchase at a reasonable price of the existing stocks of Muskat merchants. As regards condition No. (1), the Snltan sent Mr. Holland a statement showing that his average receipts for the last three years from the arms traffic worked out at about Rs. .15,000 a month (12,000/. per annum).t Mr. Holland thought he would probably accept Us. 10,000 a month (8,000L a year) as compensation. The sum of 100,000/. would, in Mr. Holland's opinion, probably cover the cost of compensating the merchants. Mr. Holland also reported that the Sultan, in spite of his treaty with France, considered that he had the right, ' in virtue of his independence,' to stop the importation of arms and ammunition. 67. On the 13th February 1910 the Government of India reported that Mr. Holland was in favour of coming to 19m iCer0y ' S telegram 0f 13th rebruary an arrangement on the lines proposed 292/10. by the Sultan, and that this view was supported by Major Trevor, who pointed out that ' the Sultan has only now made overtures when he sees we are ' in earnest, and our action has temporarily paralysed the arms trade ' ; and that ' if His Majesty's Government are prepared to support the Sultan t hi prohibiting the import of arms we shall be able to impose on him any further condition we choose. Mr. Holland urged on the 10th February 1910 that the Sultan would be liable to entangle himself with the French if a reply to his overtures were delayed ; but the Government of India doubted this, and pointed out that pressure could always be applied to the Sultan by stopping his subsidy. They preferred to defer expressing their views as to t e policy to be adopted towards the Sultan until after the return of i ajor 0x4 In the meanwhile they asked for early information as to the P^pects of coming to terms with the French Government, and enquired Lrlw't 0 f T be . su PP orted in the event of his prohibiting the import of arms into Muskat m the face of his treaty with France. 68.

'Such passes,' it was added, 'might ' be issued at Muskat only, export of arms from all other Oman ports being ' prohibited by Sultan ' No previous reference to the French Government was considered necessary, but it was recognised that some pecuniary inducement^ might have to be offered to the Sultan. On the 21st February 1910 the Government of India were asked to consider the question of territorial concessions in India as a quid pro quo in the event of negotiations with France. 69. On the lllh of March 1910 the Government of India telegraphed a Viceroy's telegr am of 14tli March 1910. . re P ort 011 ^ situation, after dis- 441 xo. cussion with the Naval Commander-in- Chief and Major (now Colonel) Cox, the latter of whom had recently arrived in India on his return from leave. Thev considered that the blockade had, so far, been most successful, and that, if it was kept up, the trade would be ruined, ' whereas if we slacken our efforts now it will revive by the cold weather.' As regards the definite proposals which had been made, they expressed their views to the following effect: — (1.) They considered it unnecessary at present to supplement the blockade by a system of 'passes' as suggested in the Secretary of State's telegram of 20th February (see paragraph (38), the Naval Commander-in-Chief being convinced that smugglers would devise means of circumventing any ' pass' system, and that ' nothing short of a total prohibition of export is of practical use ' or worth paying Sultan for.' (2.) As regards an arrangement with France, the Government of India stated that they were considering the question of possible terri torial concessions in India, but that, in view of the success of the blockade and of the proposals they were about to submit, they were now of opinion that it would be better to avoid communi cating with the French Government until the blockade operations had had their full effect in killing the trade.' The proposals they desired to submit, at the instance of the Admiral and Colonel Cox, were that ' we should now concentrate ' all our efforts upon the maintenance of effective blockade on ' Persian coast. This would be greatly promoted by temporary ' installation of wireless telegraphy at Debai, Bahrein, and ' Bushire. We could then leave Muskat entirely alone, and simply ' deal with dhows in Persian waters or with cargoes when landed, ' our system of intelligence being now so good. (In this way, by ' acting as agents of Persia in stopping the import of arms under ' the Agreement of 1897, and not acting so for our own benefit, we ' should avoid international complications with France or other ' Powers.') (o.) As regards reassuring the Sultan, all that the Government of India considered necessary was that the Political Officers should watch his attitude and 'just give him sufficient comfort to keep him from intriguing with France or Germany.' They considered that no definite sum should be promised or mentioned to him, but that for the present Colonel Cox might simply tell him orally, when passing through Muskat, that ' we are obliged to persevere with ' extermination of trade on Persian coast, but will not allow him to ' be ruined in the process.' They were altogether against giving compensation to arms dealers. They added that the Admiral would reduce the cost of the operations to the utmost, and that considerable reduction would be possible 'both during height of hot season and as trade becomes gradually attenuated by our operations.' Incidentally, they observed that the blockade operations were greatly promoting our influence and strengthening our hands in the Gulf generally.40 70. The views of the Government of India as to (1) passes, and (2) the proposed communication to the Lord Morley's telegram of 21st March g u it a n were approved by His Majesty's 19ia 309710 Government on the 21st March 1910. As regards the proposed wireless in stallations, the Government of India were instructed to telegraph the estimated cost before taking any action. As regards France, the Government of India were informed that the 'French Consul's action in facilitating purchase of dhow for arms traffic ' will now be made ground of strong representation to French (Jovernment, ' who will be urged to assist His Majesty's Government by permitting Sultan ' to prohibit import for one year, and our ships to search French dhows ' during that period, just as we are assisting French in preventing arms ' traffic with Mo r occo. This should not cause any abatement of rigour of ' blockade, but it must be borne in mind that we have no right even to ' touch French dhows except in Ibitish waters.' 1 The Government of India were also instructed, with reference to orders recently issued by the Naval Commander-in-Chief as to searching dhows flying the French flag, to remind the Admiral that 'the orders of 1867 ' (relative to merchant ships suspected of fraudulently using the French colours) ' only permit of stopping of dhows flying French flag where there is presumption that she is wrongfully flying it.' [It should be added that subsequently, in a letter dated the iSth Api ■il 1910 (3238, 10), the Foreign Office pointed out that the orders of 1867 related solelv to slave trade operations, and were not applicable to the case of vessels engaged in the arms traffic. The Government of India were instructed (18th April 1910) to warn the Admiral accordingly.] Ihe Government of India were, however, authorised, if they thought it practicable, to act on a suggestion made in a letter dated 24th Februarv 1910 from the India Office to the Foreign Office, viz. •:-to urge the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrein and Mohammerah, and the Trncial Chiefs to seize anv consignments of arms landed in their respective territories (whether b'v Sv 'l yl t n if v e or , otherwise), and to hand them over to the '[ ! /' 'i 1 ' ,'' 8 ' 1118 Majesty s Government undertaking to support the ^ bheikhs and ( hiefs m case of any unpleasantness with the French, and if ' tort^T' 1° gI r com P eusatlon for tlle arms, or to restore them ultimately to the local rulers, when assured that there is no risk of their merelv passing into the hands of the dealers.' mereij 71. The proposed representations to the French Government were Memorandum to French Government. em bodied in a Memorandum which was ««'■«« March mo rey F - Bertie ' dated30th S^ou to the French Minister for 3164/10. f oreign Affairs.

The Memorandum explained that His Majesty's Government had hoped that the result of the recent Arms Conference at Brussels would have been to enable them to cope with this evil, but that as the results of the Conference had been merely negative in regard to Muskat, they had been compelled to devise other means of dealing with the situation. The French Government were no doubt aware of the 'serious and costly steps ' recently taken with a view to checking the traffic at its source. These measures had been attended with considerable success and were in a fair way to achieving the object aimed at, when His Majesty's Government ' learned to their great ' concern that the French Consul at Muskat had facilitated the despatch of ' cargoes of arms by a French citizen on a dhow, and possibly other dhows, ' flying the French flag, in order by this means to evade the patrol now ' being carried out by His Majesty's Ships.' The Memorandum reminded the French Government of the ' friendly co-operation ' recently rendered by His Majesty's Government in stopping a similar illicit traffic in arms off the coast of Morocco,! and expressed the earnest hope that France would co operate in the same friendly manner in putting an end to a trade which ' entails grave danger to the tranquillity of the British Indian Empire and ' great prejudice to Briiish interests on the Indian frontier. 72. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government, ' confident in the ' readiness of the Government of the liepublic to accede to so legitimate a ' demand,' made the following proposals :— (1.) That the Sultan of Muskat should be empowered to prohibit the import of arms and ammunition into Muskat for a period of one year from the 1st June 1910. (2.) That instructions should be given to the French Consul at Muskat ' to abstain from any steps tending to facilitate the traffic in arms ' and ammunition with the coasts of the Persian Gulf.' (3.) That the right of search at present exercised by His Majesty's Government over Muskat and Persian dhows in Muskat terri torial waters should be extended so as to cover dhows under the French flag for the same period of one year from the 1st June 1910. 73 Sir Francis Bertie was instructed to take the first opportunity of communicating the above Memorandum Sir F. Bertie to Sir E. Grey, dated to French Minister for Foreign 5th April 1910. Affairs, and at the same time to impress 3241/10. upon M. Pichon the importance which His Majesty's Government attached to receiving an early reply. In conversa tion with the British Ambassador on the 4th April M. Pichon, after referring to the difficulties in the way of accepting the British proposals, said that it mio-ht be possible for the French Government to consent to the prohibition of ^the import of arms and ammunition into Muskat for the proposed period of one year 'from about two months later than the date suggested by His Majesty's Government,' (i.e., from about the beginning of August 1910), but that this concession would be 'with the view to giving time for a a-eneral settlement of the question.' As regards the search of dhows under the French flag by British ships of war, M. Pichon considered this proposal * It may be observed, with reference to the argument used in this passage that the Muskat Treaty with the United States concluded in 1833 (i.e. eleven years before the Irene i Treaty) makes express mention of the sale of arms and ammunition at Muskat. bee Appendix^ ^ ^ Morocco? His Majesty's Government had agreed to allow the search of British vessels by French ships of war in Moroccan territorial waters, and the trial of offenders before the proper tribunal. s. 16.42 impracticable, as the French Chambers ' would not sanction such a concession unless a suitable quid pro quo were given for it.' The whole subject, he said, would have to be discussed with the Minister for the Colonies and brought before the Cabinet. 74. On the 22nd April 1910 the Government of India were requested Lord Morley's telegram, 22nd April t' state their views by telegraph as 1910. ' to--- 3241/10. (1) The value of one year's prohibition under the conditions suggested by the French Minister for Foreign Affairs ; (2) The question of a quid pro quo in the event of llis Majesty's Govern ment finding it necessary to admit the French claims ; (3) The ' possibility of devising any scheme whereby, in co-operation '' with France, legitimate imports for local consumption could be ' provided for, and export to prohibited countries prevented.' 75.

Colonel Cox (telegram of 27th April 1910) thought that the dealers' action was to be accounted for by the statements to which prominence had been given in various English newspapers to the effect that the blockade arrangements were to be suspended until the winter. 8 b 76.

They would welcome a reasonable settlement which would relieve them of the cost and trouble of a blockade As regards cession of territory, the Government of India reported (alter consultation with the Madras Government) that there were no physical difficulties ' in ceding a considerable area round Pondi- cherry and 'rounding off' the French possessions. But they considered that no such cession should be made without an exchange m respect of other parcels of French territory in India, and would w ish m any case to make further inquiries before expressing a final opinion. (3.) They agreed with the view expressed by the Resident in the Persian Gulf that it would be necessary to purchase the consent of France and of the Sultan to the regulation by us of imports and exports at Muskat. They had no doubt that a practicable scheme could be devised. Finally, they suggested that it would be of great con venience if the French Government were to send an officer to India to carry on all preliminary negotiations. 77. It should perhaps be added that both the Admiral and Colonel Cox v c i -i • -i t -»-j . t , -p* ■ were fully agreed that, even if the Views of Admiral and Resident, Persian j tT - i p Gulf. proposed prohibition for one year were carried into effect, it would still be necessary to maintain the blockade at its present strength in order to keep out arms and ammunition already stored at Muskat or elsewhere. The Admiral deprecated any suggestion of territorial concession, being of opinion that, provided Persia remained well-disposed, the situation could be dealt Admiral S lade to Government of India, With quite effectively Without the as- 5tli May 1910. sistance of France. ' If,' he proceeded, 740/10. ' we kill market by frightening off and ' preventing customers from coming to ' it, or by preventing them from taking deliveries of goods even if they ' succeed in coming, then the trade will cease, whether it is bolstered up by ' France or not.' Colonel Cox's view was that, as the blockade was succeeding so well. Colonel Cox to Government of India, n , 0 ' expensive palliative measures ' 27th April 1910. should be proceeded with until it had 7 2q/ io reached its point of greatest effect, and that another attempt should then be made to settle the whole Muskat question with France. He considered that the refusal of the French to grant the right of search afforded good grounds for withdrawing from the negotiations for one year's prohibition, and recommended that this should be done, and that further overtures should be dropped until the spring of 1911, when the 'maximum effect' of the blockade would have been achieved. As regards the question of indemni fying arms dealers at Muskat by purchasing their stocks, Colonel Cox was of opinion that such an undertaking might prove ' enormously expensive,' and should, if possible, be avoided. The contingency should, in any case, only be entertained in the event of the Treaty of 1844 (see paragraph 9 and Appendix II.) being effectively modified. He pointed out that, so long as contraband traffic only was suppressed, vendors deserved no compensation. 78. On the 7th June 1910 the Government of India asked for sanction to continue the blockade till December 1910, when they proposed to review the situation again.

(Persian Agreement, 1897.) (1). Note from Mr. C. Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated 11th December 1897. Tfci Majesty s Grovemnient lia^ve information that large (Quantities of arms and ammunition are being exported from Great Britain to the southern ports of 1 ersia, and nlso to Muskat and Bahrein, from winch places they are smuggled across into Persia. Ilei Majesty s Government have reason to believe that a considerable portion of these consignments find their way into Afghanistan, and eventually reach the tribes on the North-west Frontier of India. The importation of arms into Persia being strictly prohibited, this traffic is illegal, and as contrary to Persian as it is to British interests. I have therefore received instructions from the Marquess of Salisbury to enquire of Your Excellency whether, with a view to stopping this illicit traffic, the Persian Government will allow Her Majesty's ships of war to seize and hand over to the Persian authorities for confiscation all cargoes of arms and ammunition owned by British or Persian subjects which may be found in Persian waters destined for importation into Persia. In the event of the importation of arms and ammunition for the use of the Persian Government a notification to Her Majesty's Legation would be sufficient to prevent seizure by Her Majesty's ships. I am also instructed to enquire of the Persian Government whether they will join Her Majesty's Government in requesting the Sultan of Muskat to issue a notice warning his subjects and others residing in Muskat from exporting arms and ammunition to Persia or British India, as the importation of such merchandise into those countries is strictly prohibited, and asking that British ships of war may be permitted to take action in the waters of Muskat for preventing such traffic by the subjects of Great Britain, Persia, and Muskat. I shall be much obliged if Your Excellency will favour me with an early reply for communication to Her Majesty's Government. (2-) Note from the Sadr-i-Azam to Mr. C. Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, dated ISth December 1897. Your letter on the prevention of the importation of arms and ammunition, written in accordance with instructions from Lord Salisbury, has been received and submitted to the appreciation of His Majesty the Shah. The opinion of the British Government that the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia should be strictly prohibited, is shared by the Persian Government. This Government has always sought to prevent the arming of the tribesmen as well as the inhabitants of the towns and frontiers. Since, in this matter, the opinions of the two Governments are in unison, and as the measures to be taken are in many respects similar, the Govern ment is prepared with the most perfect unanimity to meet the views of Her Britannic Majesty's Legation ; further, the wishes of Her Majesty's Govern ment, viz., that in addition to such measures as may be taken by Persian officials, Her Majesty's ships should examine and search all merchant vessels trading in the Persian Gulf, and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government all prohibited arms found on board, are approved by His Imperial Majesty the Shah. Should arms or ammunition be purchased to the order of the Persian Government, information of such purchases will be o-iven to Her Britannic Majesty's Legation, so that such arms may be beyond the effects of the prohibition.48 The Persian Government is also ready to join with Her Majesty's Government in requesting 1 the ^n It an oi jAIusivat to nutil} m the poitb and territories of Aluskat that arms should not iu 1 nnpoited iiom that side into Persia or Hindustan, also that English ships should exercise in regard to search and confiscation the same rights in Muskat as in Persian waters.

As to the second draft, we have ahead} sent to \ on a lottei containing our compliance with what you desire in respect of preventing the sending of arms and ammunition to the two countries—India and Persia—as is plainly stated in the Notification. We have complied with it most willingly ; and we associate with the British and Persian Governments in the arrangements that are made and will be hereafter made for the suppression of this trade m arms and ammunition. With regard to what you have hinted to us, about representing this matter to the great Government in the best way possible, so that we should be (not only) guaranteed against any loss, but (also) derive benefit by what we are doim- to help the Government we shall most gladly exert to the utmost in that matter and we firmly believe that the Government and vourself will not be phased with any loss to us.

Circular instructions issued by the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, to Captains, Commanders, and Officers Commanding His Majesty's ships employed on the East Indies Station, and all others concerned dated the 28th October 1909. 1. The following instructions on the rights of visit, search, and detention of vessels by His Majesty's ships are communicated for information and guidance. 2. Under the General Act of the Brussels Conference, 1890, His Majesty's ships are invested with the powers of visit, search, and detention over vessels suspected of being engaged in, or equipped for, the slave trade, under s. 16. o54 rprtaiu conditions which are laid down in the ' Instructions to Naval Officers employed in the Suppression of the Slave Prade (pages - to KA ^ Articles VIII to XIII. of the General Act prohibit the importation of firearms and ammunition into the territories therein specified, but the Brussels Act does not of itself confer any powers of search or detention for the enforcement of the articles quoted. 4. Such rights as His Majesty's ships possess to search and detain vessels suspected of being engaged in the arms traffic are derived trom local regulations when the vessels are in British territorial waters, and trom agreements made with certain Foreign States when the vessels are m then- respective territorial waters.
