The correspondence is predominantly between Government representatives in Karachi/Sind, the Persian Gulf Political Resident at Bushire (of which there were three incumbents during the period covered), and the native Residency Agent at Sharjah, ‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif. The cases discussed touch upon British attempts to identify and recover Baluchis reportedly taken and transported to the Trucial Coast, repatriation measures, the terms of punishment for traders/kidnappers, and the expenses incurred at offering protection for recovered slaves.Of particular interest in the file are reports on the slave trade between Baluchistan and the Gulf, 1923/24 (folios 98-114); correspondence between the native agent at Sharjah and the Trucial Coast shaikhs on slave trade (e.g. folios 361-362); and the Hindu community of Dubai’s efforts to take action against the trade of Hindu boys from Karachi (folio 364).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Mekran Coast </geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000c3#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000c3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000c3#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000c3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
