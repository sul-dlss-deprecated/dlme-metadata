Mr. Rothery's Report to the Treasury in respect to the Muscat Subsidy and Zanzibar Agency Expenses. Upon the first head of the discussion,—the liability of the Imperial Government to refund one moiety of all the payments which have been made from the Indian Treasury to Muscat since Sir B. Frere's mission of 1873, and of all future pay- ments,—Mr. Rothery concedes all we have ever asked. The only point, therefore, which need be noticed is the reservation as to the future, which he makes at page 12 of his report in the following terms:—' At the same time it must not be for- 4 4 gotten that the sole interest of the Imperial Go- &lt;c vernment in the question arises out of its desire ' to suppress the Slave trade, and, when that has tc been happily effected, I think that any payment ' on this account by the Imperial Government ' should cease. The only object of continuing the e£ payment of the subsidy, after the Slave trade has ' been entirely put down, would be to prevent an ' attack being made by the warlike Arabs of Oman ' upon the peaceful State of Zanzibar, by which ' Indian interests would be seriously affected. ' And this being an object which concerns India ' alone, should be paid for out of Indian funds.' Without entering into the question whether the peace of the Persian Gulf, which could not be maintained were hostilities allowed between Zanzibar and Oman, is a matter of such exclusively Indian interest as is assumed, or discussing how soon the Slave trade may be expected to be &lt;{ entirely suppressed,' it must be observed that the payment of the subsidy to Muscat cannot be disconnected from the Treaty of 1873, and that that treaty is not personal to the present Sultan, but was expressly made binding upon the 'heirs and successors ' of both the parties to it. During the reign of the present Sultan no question can arise, even supposing the Slave trade were 'entirely suppressed,' the pledge given to him having been clear and distinct,—' So long as he continues faith- ' fully to fulfil his treaty engagements, and mam- ' fest his friendship towards the British Govern- ' ment, the subsidy of 40,000 crowns will be paid ' annually during his rule' The Treaty is thus general—the pledge given by the Government ot India, personal—but it may be assumed as certain that the 'heirs and successors' of Toorkee will expect the subsidy to be continued to them, and that it will have to be so continued unless the Treaty of 1873 is formally annulled and declared not to be 'binding' any longer. This, however, 18728. I. 38. Aiiohi i t J:ov is a contingency which need scarcely be antici- P The amount due to India on this part of the account, up to the end of the financial year, is estimated at Es. 2,59,000, or 24,300^ The charge in future years on the Imperial Government will be Us. 43,200, convertible at the rate of exchange for the year. t i -vx Upon the second head of the case, the liability of the Imperial Government to defray one half of the expenses of the Zanzibar Agency and Consulate establishment, Mr. Rothery admits, (1) that that Government ought to contribute towards the cost of the establishment, and (2) that a moiety of such cost would be its proper share. The only remain ing question, therefore, is, from what date the liability should commence. Mr. Uothery says, the 19th June 1872, when the Duke of Argyll tele graphed to the Government of India,—' Imperial ' Government are to take half the expense.' But this Office has always persistently claimed to be relieved of half the cost of the establishment from the 24th January 1870, when a departmental Committee, composed of representatives of this Office, the Poreign and Colonial Offices, the Admi ralty, and the Treasury, unanimously reported as follows :— ' Meanwhile we are of opinion that, as so im- ' portant a part of the duties of the Agent and ' Consul at Zanzibar is, at present, connected with ' this question of the suppression of the Slave ' trade, it would be an equitable arrangement that ' the charges of the Zanzibar Agency and its ' dependencies should be * equally shared between ' the Imperial and the Indian Exchequers.' Attention is particularly directed to the words in italics, —' at present,' i.e., in January 1870. The recommendation of the Committee was at once accepted by Lord Clarendon, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who, on the 28th May 1870, made the necessary reference to the Treasury. But the Treasury refused to accede to it. Conse quently, after some intermediate correspondence, the Duke of Argyll informed the Foreign Office, on the 27th April lb7l, that this decision compelled him to regard the whole question from a new point of view, and to take ' immediate steps through the ' Government of India to place the Zanzibar ' Agency on an entirely new footing with respect to the requirements of Indian interests and t j m ^ erce *.n Tliese ste P s would involve, as Lord Granville at once saw and informed the Treasury, the loss of all control over, and pro- ^ bably the entire neglect of, all Slave trade questions at Zanzibar.' But the Treasurv re mained obdurate, though the Secretary of State in Council did not. On fte 4th August 1871, a Select Committee of t !1 i Commons on the East African Slave Trade recommended, amongst other things, that, as * I believe these figures to be very nearly right.—A. W, M.the staff at Zanzibar ' would be largely employed in the suppression of the Slave trade, the expense ' should be equally shared by the Indian and Imperial Grovernments.' Upon this the Eoreign Office addressed the following appeal ad miseri- cordiam to this Office, on the 23th August 1871 'I am directed by Earl Granville to request that ' you will state to the Secretary of State for India ' that his Lordship has waited for the Report of ^ the Select Committee of the House of Commons upon the East African Slave Trade before taking ^ an y action upon your letter of the 22nd June last, ^ notifying that, in consequence of the repeated ' refusal of the Treasury to contribute towards the ' expenses of the Zanzibar Agency, the duties of ' the Agent will be henceforward limited to such phjects as may tend directly to promote the ^ interests of India, and the controlling authority will be vested solely in the Government and Secretary of State for India, from whom all instructions must emanate. The Committee of the House of Commons ' having now recommended a division of the ex penses of the Agency between the Imperial and Indian revenues, a further representation will be ' made to the Treasury on this point, but in the fiieanwhile, and pending the veply of the Tveasuvy, who, it is to be hoped, may be induced to reverse ' their former decision, I am to suggest that, with { a view to prevent embarrassment and confusion ' in the administration of Slave trade affairs at Zanzibar, the instructions to Dr. Kirk upon these &lt;c matters might still be prepared by this Depart- &lt;£ ment, and forwarded, under flying seal, to the ' c Secretary of State for India, to be transmitted by ' him to Zanzibar.' To this, the Duke of Argyll replied on the 6th September 1871 :— ' * * * In reply to your letter of 29th ultimo, ' I am directed to acquaint you that it is the wish ' of the Duke of Argyll that no sort of embarrass- ' ment to the public service should result from the ' present uncertainty with respect to the intentions of the Lords of the Treasury with respect to the ' Zanzibar Establishment, and that his Grace will ' be happy to forward to the Agent and Consul at ' that place such instructions as Lord Granville ' may desire to transmit with respect to the East ' African Slave trade.' 5 The promised further remonstrance from the Foreign Office to the Treasury was made on the 15th October 1871. The following paragraphs are important:— ' The Lords of the Treasury must he aware of ' the heavy and important duties that devolve upon ' the Agent at Zanzibar as Judge of the Vice- ' Admiralty Court in the trial of Slave Trade ' cases, and they can appreciate as well as Lord ' Granville the serious mischief likely to ensue« from a neglect of those duto, as well as^rom :: &lt;£ Government must appoint and pay p ' ?isr™ T -. 5-525*- tt. £ :: »'•r .lw.S ' s3e and simple issue whether the Imp 6 ™' ' Government shall persevere in or abandon its ' eldeaZrs to suppress the Slave trade on the ' ^ASeleot Committee of the House of Commons, 'recently appointed, has, after hearm 0 , ' evidence that could he produced, rep ' stronelv in favour of perseverance and increased ' expenditure on a better system, and, without en- ' domne all these proposals, which have not yet « been sufficiently considered. Lord Granville can- « not doubt that, looking to the strong deling ^ich ' pervades the country on the subject of the Slave ' trade, the spirit of their report will find a response ' in Parliament, and in the public generally, who ' will insist upon more being done. f ' Lord Granville is decidedly of opinion that « such a general feeling cannot he disregarded by ' jp er Majesty's Government, and, at all events, as ' Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he will ' not assume the responsibility of disregarding i . ' It must rest, therefore, with the Lords Commis- ' sioner of Her Majesty's Treasury to decide ' whether they will, as the first step, grant or Y 1 ' ' hold the sums necessary to meet the expendituie ' for such an establishment as may be required at &lt;c Zanzibar for carrying out a more vigorous and ' better organized policy for the suppression ot the ' Slave trade on the East Coast of Africa under the ' direction of Her Majesty's Government.' The first paragraph is conclusive as to the esti mate taken by the Foreign Office of the part taken in Slave trade matters by the Zanzibar Agent at that time. The last rendered it practically impos sible for the Treasury to maintain their previous attitude. Nor did they, though we have no informa tion as to the time and manner of their yielding. All we know is that, on the 19th June 1872, the Duke of Argyll telegraphed to the Viceroy, appa rently in reference to the appointment ot a successor to Mr. Churchill, who had retired, ' Imperial Government to take half expense Zan- 44 zibar Agency. Foreign Office must, therefore^ be ' consulted. Delay any nomination.' The date of this telegram is the date which Mr. Rothery is &lt;e disposed to fix ' as that from which the British Government should pay a moiety of the expenses of the Zanzibar Agency and Consulate,e 5 • I use the figures which have been ac cepted in the Department before my time, but I believe them to be much too high, and that the difference to us would only be between 2,0001. and 3,000/. But the prin ciple is the same.—A. W. M. and he thinks that the Indian Government ought to agree to this arrangement. The grounds for this rview are not stated at any length, but they appear to be, (1) that the recommendation made by the Departmental Committee on the 24th January 1870 was ' merely the recommendation of a Com- 44 mittee, made without the sanction of any depart- ' ment of the State,' (N.B. It was sanctioned, as soon as made, both by the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, representing two out of three Departments imme diately concerned) and 'showing from its terms ' that no such engagement had at that time been ' entered into by the Imperial Government(2) that the same may be said of the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons, pre sented on the 4th August 1871, ' it was merely a recommendationand (3) that there is a ' fair ' presumption that it may have been about the ' 19th June 1872, when the Duke of Argyll sent ' off the telegram that a resolution had been ' come to by the Cabinet to pay a moiety of the c&lt; expenses.' It, therefore, comes to this, as I have observed in a former memorandum, that India is to be fined between 5,000/.* (?) and 6,000/. (?) for a delay for which this Office was in no way responsible. It cannot be disputed that before, as he has been since, the 19th June 1872, the Agent at Zanzibar was performing what is admitted to be ' Imperial' work. There is no kind of virtue in that parti cular date ; it is merely an accidental one, on which a decision, arrived at no one knows when, was communicated to the Government of India; its one merit, from the Treasury point of view, is that it is the very latest which, with any show of reason, can be fixed for our relief. I submit, therefore, that we have very good grounds for maintaining our original claim to be reimbursed one half of the actual cost of the Zanzibar establishment from the 24th January 1870, or, at any rate, from the beginning of the financial year 1870-71; but that, if it be decided not to press this extreme view, the 4th August 1871, or at latest the 29th of that month, when the Foreign Office wrote to us the letter which has been quoted, is the last date up to which the un divided cost of the establishment should be borne by India. In the event, however, of Sir L. Mallet, after further consideration in the Committee, thinking it useless to press the point, I suggest that the Imperial liability should at all events, if only with a view to the convenient adjustment of the accounts, commence from the beginning of the financial year 1872-73, or some three months earlier than is proposed by Mr. Rothery. It should also be understood that, up to the 31st March last, the Treasury should accept the Government of India statement of the actual expenditure, after giving credit for any receipts into the public ex- 18728. Bchequer, sucli as fees in the Consular Court, without requiring vouchers for each item, and that provision for the arrears due up to that date should be made in the Estimates without further question. For the current year, and in future, vouchers could, no doubt, be furnished. The estimated amount due from the Imperial Grovernment on account of the Asrency, reckoning from January 1870 to the 31st March last, is 14,663/.* If the 1st April 1872 be fixed as the date from which the Imperial ^ ^ liability should commence, these figures will have to be reduced by about 5,000/. (? 2,500/.), and the balance will be still further reduced by the ex change when the items come to be stated, as they should be, in rupees, and when allowance is made for the Consular fees carried to the public account, assuming that they have been so carried. 'While admitting the Imperial obligation in regard to the Zanzibar Agency, Mr. Hothery makes the same reservation as in the case of the subsidy, viz., that the obligation to share the charges ' should ' last so long only as the Slave trade shall continue; ' and that when the trade has been finally put c&lt; down, a new arrangement should be entered into.' This we may agree to without difficulty. Whenever the Agency ceases to be necessary for Imperial purposes, it is certain that it will be withdrawn altogether or maintained on a scale which will cost very much less than the moiety which India will continue to pay under the present arrangement. Mr. Eothery touches upon the question of the liability of India to pay a share of the cost of the Mozambique Consulate, adding, ' this, however, is ' a matter which may well be arranged when we come to settle the items of the future expendi- ' ture.' Upon this it is only necessary to observe that the two matters are quite distinct. There never has been any Indian Agency at Mozambique, nor is there any reason to- believe that, except to watch the Slave trade, a Consular officer is required there. The point was mooted in the Eeport of the Departmental Committee appointed in 1873 to consider the proposals of Sir Bartle Prere, and the Duke of Argyll, in a Letter to the Foreign Office dated 9th January 1874, thus expressed himself on it,—' His Grace is not aware of any circumstances in the interests of India, political or commercial, which would render it incumbent upon the Govei nment of that country to share the expense ' of a Consulate at Mozambique.' It may therefore, I think, be considered that the only points which will be before the Committee at their next meeting, will be (1), the date from which the Imperial Government should bear one half the /Sf i he .? anzibar Agency and Consulate; and (2), the detjuls of the estimate of the cost of the establishment in future. These details, however were pretty well settled at the last meeting. A. W. M. Political and Secret Department, 27th September 1876.'to tc- 'igli.- P.S.—I believe that all the estimates we have sent in to the Foreign Office of the amount due on account of the Agency are much too high. It has been overlooked that the establishment in 1870- 71-72, was on a much less expensive scale than in subsequent years,—not costing, I believe, more than 3,000^. a year, including contingencies.
