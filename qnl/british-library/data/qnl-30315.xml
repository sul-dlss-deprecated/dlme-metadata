(L 2944/646/410) Sir # FOREIGN 0 FIGE, S.w.l. 19th July, 1944* . - i ? J r * 4 i I havo considered the proposals contained in Mr.Jordan 1 s despatch No* 5 of 1 5th Ma rch Jihat the British Council ^hould try to secure Suni Mohammedan teachers for schools in Saudi Arabia and should assist in sending Saudi students to schools and colleges outside the country. 2 0 The British Council are v/illing to do this and to provide you v/ith such British books (in English or in Arabic), films, sports equipment or other material of a cultural nature as you. may find useful for distribution in Saudi Arabia. _After consultation with the Treasury, I have now authorised the British Council to undertake this work. You will no doubt keep Professor Boase, the British Council* s Representative for the Middle East, informed of your requirements. I have not authorised the British Council to apiDOint a representative to reside in Jedda at present, as I doubt whether the amount of cultural work to be done in Saudi Arabia would justify this appointment at the present stage, should~be grateful if you would report to me from time to time on the cultural work which is being done. 3. As regards the selection of teachers from Incia and the ujdon for nomination to Tbn Send for emnloyment in audi Arabian schools, I have advised the British Council that they should send to you for submission to Ibn Baud any nominations they are able to nuke, dubject to your views, I feel that the candidates should be carefully chosen from among Suni Mohammedans who are sufficiently keen about their religion to avoid reli/ione difficulties with Ulema, and to find residence in the Holy Land sufficient consolation for the material drawbacks they will almost certainly suffer in Saudi Arabia; that the subjects they are to teach should also be carefully chosen so as to avoid religious difficulties as far as possible, languages, geography and mathematics being safe subjects, history and science difficult, and all religious subjects, as for instance Moslem law, highly dangerous; that, in order to avoid discontent among the teachers, they should be replaced fairly frequently. 4. It is not clear to me what financial arrangements are proposed, but I do not feel that we should be justified in asking the British Council to make more than a small financial contribution, possible in tne rorm of the presentation of books to the teachers and perhaps of assistance in paying for tneir transport to Saudi Arabia, 5. In view of cert, in references made by the State Denartmeht recently to British Council ; ctivities in Saudi Arabia, X should be glad if you would keep your merican colleague fully; informed on this suestlon. We do not want Anglo-Anv rican cultural activities in Saudi Arabia to become competitive and shou d greatly prefer Tnem to be regarded fsSECRET ' 15 th iviarch, 1944 . Despatch No . Jp Sir, VI I have the honour to report that since my arrival at Jeddah I have been .endeavouring to interest His Majesty the King and his advisers in the activities ( in the Middle jiast oi‘ the British Council* On several occasions I have explained the functions of ohe Council to members of Xbn Saud* s Government and they have all expressed a considerable interest in its activities and how Saudi Arabia could benefit from the work of this organization. When in Riyadh recently His Majesty rei erred to oho subject and stated that no country could become progressive with out education. He realised that his country lagged behind many others in this respect and he int ende d in the near future to endeavour to bring education in Saudi Arabia .rioHin the range of all and up to the level or even beyond that which) existed in neighbouring Arab States. 2* he announced his intention of creating a large secondary school at Taif and } he hoped that with His Majesty's Government's assistance and that of the British Council he would be able to secure the services of teachers not only of English but o_l various technical subjects. He pointed out that in his on ini on the Hedjaz r 4 that is Mecca, Medina, iaix and Jeddah, would become the principal educational centres oi the kingdom arid he hoped that it would be possible for us to assist nim in ootaining suitable teachers for schools already existing or to be created in those centres. • &gt;&gt; * was also interested in sending Saudi subjects abroad for higher education and experience. 4. I informed His Majesty that I had already discussed with Professor Boase of the British Council in Cairo the possibility of extending the Council's activities to Saudi Arabia and that with the assistance of Professor Boase I had been able to arrange for four selected Saudi subjects ‘to enter Victoria College. I was also in communication, on the advice of Professor Doa.se, with, the principals, of 2^4 the Arab College in Jerusalem and the Gordon College in Khartoum, and I hoped that it might be possible to send selected Saudi students to both those institutions, and later to send them or students selected from amongst them to England to com— nlete their education and so to enable them to return to Saudi Arabia and be use ful to His Majesty in the administration of the country. ; *. His Majesty expressed keen interest in the scheme but insisted only on one thing, and that was that all teachers supplied to him for the education of his subjects should be Mohammedans of the Suni persuasion. He mentioned particularly ooudanese and Indians. He went on to explain the reason for this request. His country, as the centre of the Mohammedan world, could be best served by Mohammecfcins ana also these teachers* or most of them, in order to carry on their duties effect ively wouj-u have 00 enter the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina which were of course closed to other than Moslems. 6. ^ You are aware that the British Council have had no connection with Saudi Axabia up to the present and in view of His Majesty's expressed enthusiasm for • educational facilities in Saudi Arabia I feel that we here .have an ’- ? excellent opportunity of making Great Britain and its culture better known in a country where educational facilities have been sadly lacking in the past. I realise that it may be difficult to rind suitable Moslem teachers to Work under tne Council's guidance but, in view of the very friendly and close relations Jiichj^j^i. liBt'ivecfi His Majesty personally and His Majesty's Government, I recom mend strongly that a, special effort should be made to meet His Maiesty's wishes and reliable Mohammedan teachers employed and placed at His Majesty's disposal.
