In reply he states that it would be out of the question to comply with the request of the Chief, and approves of the communication that was sent from the Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Chief. He writes that it is the view of the Governor in Council that a remonstrance sent to the Sheik of Aboothabee will be sufficient to induce him to abandon his design.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023654730.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
