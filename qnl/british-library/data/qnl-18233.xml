Samuel Hennell informs Justin Sheil that a certain Meer Mahomed Sadik has applied for support in recovering 1,041 tomans worth of merchandise, which he purchased in Shiraz with the intention of exporting it to India, via Bushire. Hennell states that while the merchandise was on its way to Bushire it was plundered by Khoda Kurreem Khan. Hennell reports that he has declined to interfere in the affair, but at Meer Mahomed Sadik's request has agreed to submit the case to Sheil. Hennell attaches copies of two documents (not included) that support Meer Mahomed Sadik claim for British protection.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000015#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
