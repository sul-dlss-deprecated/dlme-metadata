Therefore, the frontier between the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and these Sheikhdoms will be agreed between the Saudi Arabian Government and the Sheikhdoms in question”• 2. I infomed Ur. Woods-Ballard that the reply being made to this olalra was to the effeet that ”Kis Majesty's Government are disappointed that the Saudi Government so far from putting forward reasonable elalms have Increased then far beyond the maximum previously put forward, and are not consistent with their statement that they would make every reasonable sacrifice- to remove misunderstandings. . His Majesty's Government assume in present claim Buralmi area is referred to and in which, of course, claims of Shaikh of Abu Dhabi give His Majesty's Government multilateral right to negotiate on his behalf. As to areas of South Buraimi the Sultan of Muscat claims these to be under his authority and he has asked His Majesty's Government te represent him. The Sultan of Muscat and Oman was particularly referred to in the Emir Abdullah's declaration, and His Majesty's Government trust that the Saudi policy towards him has not bsen changed 1 ’• 3. I also informed Mr. Woods-Ballard that to aigr suggestion of the Saudi Government that they should negotiate with the Imam, the reply will be given that the Sultan of Unseat ie the £e lure Ruler of Oman, and under International Law the Imam could only concern himself in negotiations with the consent of the Sultan of Muscat5. 4. I asked Hr. ^oods-Ballard to consider what the Sultan's attitude will be if/kaudi Government ask to negotiate with the Imam, but with the Sultan's permission. 5. 1 also asked Ur. Woods-Ballard if there is anything else the Sultan would wish His Majesty's Government to say in rebuttal of the Saudi claim, and whether he would bo willing and able to produo* documentary proof of the allegiance to bin of all or any of the tribes eoneerned should His Jfejesty's Government find it desirable to ask him to do so. / 6 .

I enclose herewith a copy of the relevant correspondence. If you see no objection, would you kindly inform Woods- Ballard of the claim made by the Saudi Arabian Government in the first enclosure and of the reply which is being made to this claim. You should then speak to him on the lines suggested in the last two sentences of Foreign Office tele gram 677 and enquire whether there is anything else the Sultan would wish us to say in rebuttal of the Saudi claim and whether he would be willing and able to produce documentary proof of the allegiance to him of all or any of the tribes concerned should we find it desirable to ask him to do so. 2. If Woods-Ballard wishes to ascertain the Sultan’s views urgently you could ask the Foreign Office to transmit a message to him through the Deputy United Kingdom High Commissioner, Bombay.COPY EXTRACT (PARA 5) OF SAUDI ARABIAN GOVT. STATEMENT ENCLOSED WITH JEDDAH DESPATCH NO.25 (580/161/49) OF 18 OCTOBER. As regards what lies to the South and Fast of the position 24 0 25 , North and longitude 55 c, 26 , East, this is under the authority of Shaikhdoms which are not in treaty relations with the British Government. Therefore, the frontier between the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and these Shaikhdoms will be agreed between the Saudi Arabian Government and the Shaikhdoms in question. COPY COMMENTS ON THE ABOVE BY JEDDAH AS CONTAINED IN THEIR TELNO 82 OF 26 OCTOBER TO THE RESIDENCY, PARA 2. Para 5. This might be covered by our statements of the legal position i.e. we could not admit the right o t any other power to negotiate with the tribes within a British sphere of influence. Alternatively we might ask what shaikhdoms are British. If the answer men tions Buraimi we would counter with Abu Dhabi’s claim s ! i/s to two thirds of it: if (gp.undec), we could say thatthe Sultan of Muscat is the de jure ruler of Oman. COPY POLITICAL RESIDENT’S COMMENTS ON PARA 5 OF SAUDI STATEMENT AS CONTAINED IN TELNO 520 OF 3 NOVEMBER TO FOREIGN OFFICE REPEATED TO JEDDAH TELNO 92. .... but with regard to para 5 we should I think t avoid any reference to a British sphere of influence and insist that all the tribes concerned are either subject to Abu Dhabi who is under our protection or owe allegiance to Muscat on whose behalf we are negotiating. It should be possible to produce docu mentary proof of this allegiance in many cases if the Sultan is willing to let us have it. * COPY EXTRACT WITH PREAMBLE OF FOREIGN OFFICE TELNO 675 OF 4 NOVEMBER TO BAHRAIN.

Aou/“N - 3 - You should now address the Saudis on the lines of para 2 of mytel 692 adding that we are greatly disappoin ted that so far from putting forward reasonable claims these should have been increased far beyond the maximum put forward in previous negotiations. These claims are inconsistent with the wish expressed in the Saudi state ment of September 11th to make every reasonable sacri fice in order to remove misunderstandings. 2. You should add to the above general statement de tailed comments suggested in para 2 of your telegram under reference with the following modifications:- .... (d) Para 6. You should not refer to a British sphere of influence instead of asking what Shaikhdoms are meant you should say that we assume they mean Bu- raimi where, of course, the claims of the Shaikh of Abu 4 Dhabi give HMG a multilateral right to negotiate on his behalf. As to the areas of South Buraimi the Sultan of Muscat claims these to be under his authority and he has asked us to represent him. The Sultan of Muscat and Oman was particularly referred to in the Emir Abdullah's declaration and we trust that the Saudi policy towards him has not been changed. Any suggestion of the Saudis that they should negotiate with the Imam should be met /with# mm 4 - with a reply that the Sultan of Muscat is the de jure Ruler of Oman and under International Law the Imam could only concern himself in negotiations with the consent of the Sultan of Muscat.Telegram (INDIV; © From Frodromc, London To Prodromej Bahrain No.677. Repeated for information to Political, Lfnscat No.26, Jedda and British Mid 'le Fast Office (Cairo). Dated 4tt, received 5th November, 1949• You have not commented but our position must surely be that while we have no intention to make trouble for the Sultan with Saudis latter have asked for settlement of all their South Eastern boundaries and while Sultan may be ’’content with situation as it exists today” (whatever he means by that and whatever that situation is) it is fairly clear Saudis will not be content with it. This my be expected to emer from their statement of claims which in view of paragraph 2 (d) of my telegram 722 to Jedda vdll be made to us unless Saudis refuse to accept our points. You may” wish to discuss this question further with Sultan stressing our anxiety to be as helpful as possible and you should in an; case tell him that in his interests we have felt bound to answer as we ominous have done (omission) Saudis/proposal to negotiate direct frontiers around and South of Buraimi with ’’Shaikhdoms which are not in Treaty Relations with British Government'. You should also ask him to consider what his attitude vdll be if Saudis ask to negotiate vdth Imam but with Sultans consent. /From Political, ffuscat To Prodrome, Bahrain.No.186.

Your telegram No.188 October I2th. Saudi negotiations• 2 . I have ascertained informally that attitude is as follows. ’’Muscat Government have made no claim. They merely agreed in 1937 at our request to a line up to which His Majesty's Government could recognise Saudi claims provided they were substantiated and the line when demarcated included Ramlat Mughshin in Muscat territory as this oasis has always been regarded as being situated within the boundary of the Sultanate. The Muscat Government is content with the situation as it exists today and trusts His Majesty's Government will be able to avoid development of any boundary dispute. There is none today and they would wish to avoid creation of any fresh dispute”. 3. Foregoing seems compatible with records and in His Majesty’s Government’s interest to support to avoid risk of Sultanate becoming involved in succession of any attempt at closer association of Muscat and Saudi borders would involve. Moreover pos^ + i nrt as summarised in late Sir Trenchard Fowle's demi-official letter No.390 S of the 26th May, 1937 to Walton of India Office especially paragraph 4 (f) regarding Tfuscst appears correct, and there seems nothing from Muscat standpoint to add to this and Bahrain telegram No.49 to Jedda repeated 400 to Foreign Office dated the 31st August. ho Chauncyy A C S£C££T- From Political Resident, Bahrain' To Political Agent, Muscat, fi/d Repeated for information Savinr Foreign Office, British Middle East and Jedda.

Secret. Addressed to Jeddah telno 49 August 31 repeated to F.O. Foreign Office telegram 512 to me. I have not yet received your letter referred to. Sultans of Muscat exercised authority over interior of Oman until 1913 when tribes revolted and elected their own Imam. Hostilities continued between the tribes and Sultan until 1920 when an agreement was effected between them through the Political Agent. Under this agreement which has never been published and which Sultan does not want published, amongst other things the tribes undertook to remain at peace and amity and not interfere with the Government of the Sultan and the Sultans Government undertook not to interfere in the internal affairs of the tribes. Since then Imam has been de facto ruler of interior but has never been recognised internationally. By agreement of 1920 Sultan did not grant full independence to tribes but only promised not to interfere in their internal affairs, and must therefore still be regarded as responsible for their external relations. We have always recognised him as de jure Ruler of the interior. Extent of his dominions however is KBWKkxK nowhere defined in his treaties with H.M.G., U.S.A. and France. For more detailed information please see narrative relating to Oman in Aitchison Volume XI. 2. The Sultan exercises effective control over-the hinter land of Dhofar, according to Thesiger up to and including the Ramlat A1 Mughsin.■HpiHMi mm TELF CYPHER OTP FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO BAHRAIN TELNO 512 ^ATED 26/8/49 RECD. 27/8/49 Priority Secret.

Repeated for information to Foreign Office, London.No.30 &amp; Jedda. (Foreign Office please pass to Jedda. Dated the 5th September, 1949 PRIORITY . 1 c/ j Foreign Office telegram No.518. I have approached the Sultan about a representative in the boundary negotiations. He said he had considered the possibility since you first raised the matter in your last visit, but he had decided he had nobody available to send. I urged the advantages on him, suggesting Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim, Minister of the Interior, and asking if he would like time to consider the matter, but he was adamant and said his mind was made up. 2. I received the impression that it is not lack of a suitable representative that made the Sultan refuse, but a desire not to be implicated directly in the negotiations as far as possible in case this might cause trouble with the Imam. It is revealing that when I J pointed out the Saudis might suggest dealing direct with the Imam over Eastern boundary, he said that he could hardly oppose the Imam but felt sure that in such a case the Imam would consult him first before replying to the Saudis,* Sultan finally suggested that difficult questions requiring tribal knowledge during the negotiations might be put to him telegraphically through this Agency. Andrew MBFrom Telegram To *M , (Pad) Prodrome, Bahrain Political, Muscat. No.147. Dated 1st, received 2nd September, 1949. PRIORITY. Secret• Qatar and Abu Dhabi are being asked to send representatives to Jedda to be available for ?consultation during boundary negotiations with Saudi Arabia. Foreign Office desire that Sultan should also be asked if he can provide a nonaultativeT reuresentfetive . They consider that although he may not be able to produce a competent man he should be given opportunity especially as it is embarrassing for His Majesty’s Government to assume whole burden of presenting Sultan's case without assistance from him. A discreet spokesman (mut) can be briefed without much tribal knowledge might be better than no one. It is possible that Saudis may suggesting dealing direct with Imam over their eastern boundary and assistance may be required in resisting this. 2 # Please approach Sultan urgently and telegraph result to me repeating to Foreign Office and Jedda reference Foreign Office telegram No.518.
