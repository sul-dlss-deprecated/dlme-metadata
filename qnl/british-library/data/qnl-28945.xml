The borie which has been sticking in the throat of the Ministry is this; the cost of purchasing this apparatus in India is ridiculously high; the Treasury are unwilling to sanction purchase in America. V/e have now, hov/ever, localed apparatus in this country, and I have every hope that sanction will soon be forthcoming• Nobody can regret the delay more than I do; but where these questions of exchange and currency are concerned, official wheels turn slowly!
