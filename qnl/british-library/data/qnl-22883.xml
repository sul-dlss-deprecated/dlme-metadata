THE BERGIUS COMPANY, LTD., 254 BOBBIE'S LOAN, GLASGOW, C.4. January, 1942. V 4FOREWORD In 1904 we started business as the Ber^ius Car and Engine Company, our product being a four-cylinder pleasure car having low tension magneto ignition. The manufacture of cars was soon abandoned and the engine altered to suit marine conditions. Our first models were thus evolved, and soon established a reputation for reliability. Although designed 33 years ago these engines still sell freely. The first Kelvin engine to be installed in a yacht was recently acquired by us after 29 years of service. In 1907 our folding side propeller was first applied to a sailing vessel. From then onward began a revolution in the fishing industry of this country in which Kelvin Engines have always played the leading part. Of all the uses to which motor engines are put, service in a Scotch fishing boat is probably the most severe—50 hours per week, 30 weeks per year; long periods at full speed ; hours upon end of slow running ; exposure to salt water and dirt ; maintenance by unskilled labour. These boats carry no spare parts. They depend on a single engine and have no sails. The Kelvin-Ricardo Engine is intended to work under these conditions, and to do so with a greater degree of efficiency than has hitherto been attained by any engine consuming paraffin. Our plant is the most up-to-date devoted to marine engines in this country Our output of engines to date is 21,000. Our stores contain the parts of every model—4,387 varieties at the moment. No Kelvin engine, however old, need be superseded for want of parts. This unique service accounts for the fact that Kelvins remain saleable after many years of service.General Description These are four-cycle engines with detachable heads and poppet valves.^ They are built to withstand continuous full load and have all useful refinements— high efficiency, silence, oil tightness, absence of heat and smell. They are built in 6 models, E and F in two types—one to consume self vaporising oil such as petrol, gasolene, or benzene, the other to consume oils which require heat to vaporise them such as paraffin, petroleum, or kerosene. All models comply with the requirements of Lloyd's and the Board of Trade. POWER—Each engine is tested and is guaranteed capable of developing within 3 per cent, of the power, speed and consumption stated. An extract from the test record is furnished to a purchaser on request. WORKMANSHIP—The machine work is equal in quality to that prevailing in automobile engines of the highest class. All parts are hand finished—no sharp edges. CYLINDERS—In pairs with detachable heads, priming valve for each cylinder, eye bolt for each pair. Barrels machine-honed - very efficient. VALVES—Of chrome-nickel steel, completely enclosed—silent and oil tight, valve guides separate from cylinder—renewable. CAMSHAFT—With cams integral, removable along with cylinder. Bearings of bronze split for adjustment. Every cam close beside a bearing—no whip—clearance a minimum—silence. Gears of steel driven by roller chain. CARBURETTORS—Dripless at all speeds. Unaffected by a list to port or starboard of 25 degrees, or by a rake of shaft up to 1 in 9. or by a head of fuel up to 8 feet- Jets removable without stopping engine. Models E and F have one carburettor per pair of cylinders. Models G have a carburettor for each cylinder. VAPORISER—Kept hot by copper-asbestos cover. WATER REGULATOR—At full speed the water passes from the pump via the exhaust manifold to the cylinder, thence to the silencer. When running slow most of the water passes direct to the silencer. This method of control keeps the cylinders hot and the exhaust pipe cool. SLOW RUNNING ON PARAFFIN—A feature of these engines due to the asbestos cover over the vaporiser, and the water regulator. The engines will run for indefinite periods at one-fourth of normal load. LUBRICATION—Automatic. The oil supply is carried in the crankcase below the reach of the cranks. A pump supplies a drip situated in the path of each revolving crank. A dip rod indicates the level. The filling pipe has a gauze of sufficient area to pass cold oil. The engine may be inclined to the extent of 1 in 9. OIL PUMP—Of gunmetal, plunger type, with ball valves and gauze strainer. CRANKCASE PUMP T To empty the crankcase as necessary to maintain the quality of the lubricating oil. CRANKSHAFT—Of nickel steel—very hard. The four-cylinder model has three bearings, the two-cylinder model two bearings, of wh]te__jiietaHq5tTr for adjustment (patent). The crank pins are hollow^ to reduce unbalanced weight. BALANCE—The two-cylinder models have balance weights on the crank shaft and cause no more vibration than the four-cylinder models. FLYWHEEL—Balanced and of ample weight for running slow. Flywheel pan to protect flywheel from bilge water. STARTING HANDLE—At rear end as shown or at front end if preferred, in which position it becomes left-handed to operate. The chain is not in motion unless at starting.989 £0 IMS IONS—Of iron with three rings, bronze hushed, hardened pin. * CONNEC 11NG RODS—Of steel H section—very light. Big ends of white metal split for adjustment. Bolts of nickel steel. CRANKCASE- In one piece—permits of large inspection doors—also rigid and oiltight. White enamelled inside—easy to clean out. hXHAl'Sr MANIFOLD air cooled on Models E, water cooled on F and G—prevents overheating of engine-room and warping of woodwork. KjNI I ION —Models E—By magneto, driven by enclosed chain, quickly adjustable. Stopping terminal on top of cylinder. IGNI I ION—Models F and G—By magneto, driven by enclosed chain, mounted in a special manner which provides a larger range than is usual— greater safety in starting, and more advance for full speed. These features are attained by rotating the whole magneto instead of merely the contact breaker. Stopping terminal on top of cylinder. IMPULSE SIARTER working in conjunction with magneto produces a rapid movement of the armature at starting and ceases automatically to act when the engine starts. Models F and G only. CONTROL—A centrifugal governor, entirely enclosed, controls the throttle valve and takes care of the engine speed when the clutch is out. Models G only. Hand levers control governor and magneto. The reversing gear is controlled by a gunmetal hand-wheel. DECK CON FROL—For the control of clutch and throttle from deck or cockpit a variety of littings may be supplied. (See installation sheet No. 6). WATER PUMP—Of uni-flow type—noiseless. Plunger cotton packed—sand resisting. Pump fixed sufficiently low to be submerged in the shallowest of boats—reliable. S TRAINER—Combined with the seacock is a strainer which may be cleared from inboard without stopping the engine. REV ERSE ( j EAR—Attached direct to engine—permanent in alignment. I lie ahead clutch is double in Models F and G, the astern clutch single. Both of cast-iron. The thrust both ahead and astern is taken on ball bear ings situated within the case which is white enamelled inside and oil tight. SILENCER of our well-known pattern in which the circulating water and exhaust gases mix together—discharge almost inaudible —silencer and exhaust pipe never more than hand hot. This silencer must be above sea level. For deep boats a standpipe to raise it is furnished without extra charge. Silencer may be at front end if preferred. ACCESSIBILITY—All running parts liable to damage are enclosed, yet the accessibility is good, a piston and connecting rod may be removed and replaced through the inspection door in 7 minutes. All crank bearings are adjustable through the inspection door. Crankshaft comes out at either end. Any repair can be carried out without removing engine from boat. SCREW THREADS—The British Standard Fine Thread is used throughout (except for pipes) in preference to the Whitworth thread now out of date except lor rough work. Studs are used in place of set screws. The small ones are of rustless material. EQUIPMENT—Propeller of bronze balanced by a special process. Stern- tube of naval brass with a 'cutless' rubber bearing on the outside and a gunmetal stuffing box inside. Shaft bearings of gunmetal split for adjustment. All pipes of copper. Tool outfit very complete. (See pages 1003 1005). BOA 1 BUILDERS—'The installation of a ' Kel vin equipment involves no engineering work, and can be undertaken in a few hours by a carpenter with his ordinary tools. The pipes, being copper, can be bent by hand. I he fittings are designed to require neither screwing nor brazing. The shafting may be cut to length by a hand saw.990 Kelvin-Ricardo Engine and Marine Equipment^ Model E2 with 2 Cylinders, Ih Horse-Power.

THE BERGIUS COMPANY, LTD., 254 BOBBIE'S LOAN, GLASGOW, C .4. January, 1942.FOREWORD In 1904 we started business as the Bergius Cat and Engine Company, our product being a four-cylinder pleasure car having low tension magneto ignition. The manufacture of cars was soon abandoned and the engine altered to suit marine conditions. Our first models were thus evolved, and soon established a reputation for reliability. Although designed 33 years ago these engines still sell freely. The first Kelvin engine to be installed in a yacht was recently acquired by us after 29 years of service. In 1907 our folding side propeller was first applied to a sailing vessel. From then onward began a revolution in the fishing industry of this country in which Kelvin Engines have always played the leading part. Of all the uses to which motor engines are put. service in a Scotch fishing boat is probably the most severe—30 hours per week, 30 weeks per year; long periods at full speed ; hours upon end of slow running ; exposure to salt water and dirt ; maintenance by unskilled labour. These boats carry no spare parts. They depend on a single engine and have no sails. The Kelvin-Ricardo Engine is intended to work under these conditions, and to do so with a greater degree of efficiency than has hitherto been attained by any engine consuming paraffin. Our plant is the most up-to-date devoted to marine engines in this country Our output of engines to date is 21,000. Our stores contain the parts of every model—4,387 varieties at the moment. No Kelvin engine, however old, need be superseded for want of parts. This unique service accounts for the fact that Kelvins remain saleable after many years of -service.988 General Description These are four-cycle engines with detachable heads and poppet valves. 1 hey are built to withstand continuous lull load and have all useful refinements ^ high efficiency, silence, oil tightness, absence of heat and smell. They are built in 6 models. E and F in two types—one to consume self vaporising oil such as petrol, gasolene, or benzene, the other to consume oils which require heat to vaporise them such as paraffin, petroleum, or kerosene. All models comply with the requirements of Lloyd's and the Board of Trade. POWER—Each engine is tested and is guaranteed capable of developing within 3 per cent, of the power, speed and consumption stated. An extract from the test record is furnished to a purchaser on request. WORKMANSHIP—The machine work is equal in quality to that prevailing in automobile engines of the highest class. All parts are hand finished—no sharp edges. CYLINDERS—In pairs with detachable heads, priming valve for each cylinder, eye bolt for each pair. Barrels machine-honed -very efficient. VALVES—Of chrome-nickel steel, completely enclosed—silent and oil tight, valve guides separate from cylinder—renewable. CAMSHAFT—With cams integral, removable along with cylinder. Bearings of bronze split for adjustment. Every cam close beside a bearing—no whip—clearance a minimum—silence. Gears of steel driven by roller chain. CARBURETTORS—Dripless at all speeds. Unaffected by a list to port or starboard of 23 degrees, or by a rake of shaft up to 1 in 9. or by a head of fuel up to 8 feet. Jets removable without stopping engine. Models E and F have one carburettor per pair of cylinders. Models (1 have a carburettor for each cylinder. VAPORISER—Kept hot by copper-asbestos cover. WATER REGULATOR—At full speed the water passes from the pump via the exhaust manifold to the cylinder, thence to the silencer. When running slow most of the water passes direct to the silencer. This method of control keeps the cylinders hot and the exhaust pipe cool. SLOW RUNNING ON PARAFFIN—A feature of these engines due to the asbestos cover over the vaporiser, and the water regulator. The engines will run for indefinite periods at one-fourth of normal load. LUBRICATION—Automatic. The oil supply is carried in the crankcase below the reach of the cranks. A pump supplies a drip situated in the path of each revolving crank. A dip rod indicates the level. The filling pipe has a gauze of sufficient area to pass cold oil. The engine may be inclined to the extent of 1 in 9. OIL PUMP—Of gunmetal, plunger type, with ball valves and gauze strainer. CRANKCASE PUMP—To empty the crankcase as necessary to maintain the quality of the lubricating oil. CRANKSHAFT—Of nickel steel —very hard. The four-cylinder model has three bearings, the two-cylinder model two bearings, of white metal split for adjustment (patent). The crank pins are hollow to reduce unbalanced weight. BALANCE—The two-cylinder models have balance weights on the crank shaft and cause no more vibration than the four-cylinder models. FLYWHEEL—Balanced and of ample weight for running slow. Flywheel pan to protect flywheel from bilge water. STARTING HANDLE—At rear end as shown or at front end if preferred, in which position it becomes left handed to operate. The chain is not in motion unless at starting.1003 Tool Box with sliding lid and double bottom, dovetailed, varnished, and closed with lead seal. Contents as under :— MODEL G2.

IGNITION—Models E—By magneto, driven by enclosed chain, quickly adjustable. Stopping terminal on top of cylinder. IGNITION—Models F and G—By magneto, driven by enclosed chain, mounted in a special manner which provides a larger range than is usual— greater safety in starting, and more advance for full speed. These features are attained by rotating the whole magneto instead of merely the contact breaker. Stopping terminal on top of cylinder. IMPULSE STARTER working in conjunction with magneto produces a rapid movement of the armature at starting and ceases automatically to act when the engine starts. Models F and G only. CON PROL—A centrifugal governor, entirely enclosed, controls the throttle valve and takes care of the engine speed when the clutch is out. Models G only. Hand levers control governor and magneto. The reversing gear is controlled by a gunmetal hand-wheel. DECK CONTROL—F or the control of clutch and throttle from deck or cockpit a variety of fittings may be supplied. (See installation sheet No. 6). WATER PUMP—Of uni-flow type—noiseless. Plunger cotton packed—sand resisting. Pump fixed sufficiently low to be submerged in the shallowest of boats—reliable. S TRAINER—Combined with the seacock is a strainer which may be cleared from inboard without stopping the engine. REVERSE GEAR—Attached direct to engine—permanent in alignment. I he ahead clutch is double in Models F and G, the astern clutch single. Both of cast-iron. The thrust both ahead and astern is taken on ball bear ings situated within the case which is white enamelled inside and oil tight. SILENCER of our well-known pattern in which the circulating water and exhaust gases mix together—discharge almost inaudible —silencer and exhaust pipe never more than hand hot. This silencer must be above sea level. For deep boats a standpipe to raise it is furnished without extra charge. Silencer may be at front end if preferred. ACCESSIBILITY—All running parts liable to damage are enclosed, yet the accessibility is good, a piston and connecting rod may be removed and replaced through the inspection door in 7 minutes. All crank bearings are adjustable through the inspection door. Crankshaft comes out at either end. Any repair can be carried out without removing engine from boat. SCREW THREADS—The British Standard Fine Thread is used throughout (except for pipes) in preference to the Whit worth thread now out of date except for rough work. Studs are used in place of set screws. The small ones are of rustless material. EQUIPMENT—Propeller of bronze balanced by a special process. Stern- tube of naval brass with a ' cutless' rubber bearing on the outside and a gunmetal stuffing box inside. Shaft bearings of gunmetal split for adjustment. All pipes of copper. Tool outfit very complete. (See pages 1003-1003). BOAT BUILDERS—The installation of a ' Kelvin ' equipment involves no engineering work, and can be undertaken in a few hours by a carpenter with his ordinary tools. The pipes, being copper, can be bent by hand. The fittings are designed to require neither screwing nor brazing. The shafting may be cut to length by a hand saw.990 Kelvin - Ricardo Engine and Marine Equipment Model E2 with 2 Cylinders, 7J Horse-Power. ^ The engine is illustrated opposite and is complete with reversing gear, clutch, magneto ignition, water-cooled silencer, flywheel pan, etc. The standard equip ment is as follows, and. with the addition of woodwork, is suitable to complete an installation in a normal boat without further outlay.

Some prefer the Sylph ^like form, others the lines of Two^ton Tessie. But to the worker who has got to hang on, hour after hour, to the waist of a small power tool squeezing it gently every few seconds, there are definite advantages in slimness. A half inch extra in the 'spread' of the grasp may seem nothing at 7 or 8 ack emma. But by ten o'clock a man will have cramp in his fingers, a droop in his wrist and a sinking feeling in his tum.

There is every reason, however, why there should be an improve ment over the position last year, and those who have any power to assist a movement in this direction should use their efforts to the full. If, as seems possible, a basic ration of petrol be granted to motorists during the com ing months, it should be ensured that a corresponding allowance be given for the unrestricted use of pleasure motor boats. In the sixth year of war, we have to take a very much deeper view of the meaning of the mainten ance of full war effort, and the psychological problems must be kept clearly in view. It is fully recognized in more enlightened quarters that the need for healthy relaxation as a reaction has now become of first importance, and to enable the largest possible number of people to go afloat is, therefore, a policy which should find favour in Government circles. That dread term ' war weariness ' has a real meaning now, and it is useless to deny it. It is not a problem of some people enjoying themselves whilst others fight. It is a question of mental and physical powers being maintained to the utmost among the whole population if we are to see a really successful end to the war. We believe, therefore, it would be wise for a basic ration of petrol to be allowed for use in cars or motor boats without restriction, and are hopeful that this will be done before the summer. The main objections to such a policy no longer carry the weight they did until a few months ago. The supply is ample, the tanker tonnage available has increased by at least a couple of million tons—admittedly it has more work to do—and the danger from submarine attack has diminished. A certain relaxation in regulations relating to the use of coastal waters and estuaries is now warranted in view of the complete change in the war situation since the summer of 1944. It is improbable, however, that any concession of importance will be made unless requests be put forward by responsible authorities. As there is no national body watching the interests of yachts men, which might have made such an appeal to cover the whole country, it is desirable that local clubs should apply direct to the Admiralty for permission to use pleasure craft in the area in whieh they are con cerned. If satisfaction is not obtained the local Member of Parliament should be requested to take up the ques tion in the House of Commons. It is obvious that a great deal of latitude could now be given, without, in any possible manner, endangering the National safety and with great advantage from the standpoint of the health of the community. How Many Boats 7 . ♦ . HOW many yachts, cruisers and launches are there now available, in relation to the number in service when war broke out? Most owners whose cruisers have been requisitioned by the Admiralty or other Depart ments rightly take the view that they must not expect to be able to use them again, or, if they do, only after a long period involved in the necessary repairs and over haul. ' Non-requisitioned craft, which have not received any special attention during the war years, have, for the most part, deteriorated considerably and, in some instances, beyond reasonable repair. Every remaining boat will need a great deal of attention and we reach the conclusion that the usable British yacht and motor cruiser fleet will have diminished by 30 or 40 per cent, in actual numbers, and in quality to an almost incalculable extent. From this it results that the immediate requirements, after the war, for pleasure craft of all sizes up to 60 ft. will be large and may be surprisingly heavy. There are already indications. All boatbuilders in the country have received many requests for particulars of new post-war craft, and substantial numbers of orders have been placed, with suitable deposits. Inquiries relating to the availability of converted Ser vice boats are numerous, but on this score nothing can be said, until the scheme for surplus disposal of Service craft, already agreed between the Admiralty and the industry, is ratified. That this has not been done is dis turbing in view of the Government's avowed desire for such schemes to be put in hand without delay and of the attempts which are already apparently being made by speculative groups to buy up war-used motor boats for the sole purpose of their disposal to the public at a profit. This is a situation which had been visualized by those who have worked for the establishment of an orderly and controlled scheme which should be helpful to the motor boat industry and, at the same time, fair to the prospective purchasers of motor pleasure craft after the war. It is of the utmost importance that a start be made in the planning of disposal, and particularly in the planning of conversions to pleasure cruisers. If carefully done it would ensure the supply of a number of good cruisers at a reasonable price, and at a time when new boats had not yet become available in sufficient quantity to meet the demand. Unless these preparations are made, there is a likelihood of unsuitable types of boats being thrown on the market—to the great detriment of motor boating on account of the many users who would rapidly be dis couraged and would give up the idea of motor boating for good and all. clthe motor B oat •&lt;&gt;« Yachting February, 1945. ' CHARMINA'S ' OWNER ONLY a few months ago we commented on this page on the fact that ' Charmina,' the little Strange designed yawl made famous by Keble Chatterton's cruising in her, was advertised for sale. That this might signify that her owner was in poor health was, of course, a possibility. Nevertheless, the news of Keble Chatterton's death at the New Year was a shock, and a sad one. He was 66 years of age. We yachting folk knew him best by his yachting books, naturally. But a much larger public esteemed Keble Chatterton for his books on the sea and ships generally. A mere list of them would occupy the rest of this column, for he was one of the most industrious authors of our time—if industry is to be measured by output, as perhaps it should be. After graduating at Oxford, Keble Chatterton became a journalist in London. For some years his work lay with art and dramatic criticism. How, when, why, and where the urge to write about ships and the sea came to him I do not know, but it does not appear that he had any, or much, practical acquaintance with the sea at the time when he published his first book. ' Down Channel in ' Vivette ' ' But, oh dear ! I find that I am wrong there, and badly wrong. From the title page of ' Down Channel in ' Vivette,' ' by E. Keble Chatterton, I see that it was published in 1910. Now his first book on the sea was published in 1909. And what do you think its title was? ' Sailing Ships: The Story of their Development from Earliest Times to the Present Day.' Nothing less! It is as though a youth had had his head turned by some chit of a girl and, to mark the cataclysm in his soul, sat down to write a massive masterpiece with somt such title as ' Love; From the Garden of Eden Until To-day.' For Keble Chatterton had possession of his little boat some little while before he wrote ' Sailing Ships: The Story of their Development, etc.'—the * book hymning the glory of all the seas and all the ships that ever were. But now see what happened. Having got the book ' Explaining everything ' off his chest, our young author took a trip down Channel in his own little boat. The fruit of this trip—just such a cruise as hundreds of men with a few weeks' leisure make every summer— the fruit of this trip was what, in my view, in which I have never wavered for over 30 years, was, and still is, a masterpiece. The title of the work is ' Down Channel in 'Vivette/ ' as good a yachting book as we have ever had, as fresh to-day as when it appeared in 1910. And, compared with the unavoidable drudgery of ' Sailing Ships; The Story of their Development, etc.,' what pleasure that book must have given its author. Yet there was a result exceeding the pleasure; I mean. the discovery, the revelation rather, that the large things are only the small things magnified, and that a man can learn as much from practical experience of one tiny vessel in one small sea as he can learn from all the books about all the ships in all the seas—and much, much more. It is this contrast between the thing experienced and the thing imagined, the facts at first hand and the facts reported, that to my mind makes such a world of differ ence between Keble Chatterton's yachting books and his general books. The ever-fresh ' Down Channel ' and the enchanting ' Charmina ' books I shall never tire of. But all these innumerable books about U-boats, Q-ships, smugglers, pirates, and so on, and so on, I can only read, if at all, with fatigue. In the R.N.V.R. This, it is important to note, is no fault of Keble Chatterton, however much or little it may be a fault in the reader. The man could not help himself. Before he really got going on his theme the 1914-1918 war came along. For the better part of that war Keble Chatterton, who had at once joined up in the R.N.V.R., served at sea, part of the time in the Western Approaches. Towards the end of the war he went to work in the His torical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence. It was his work there which, because it necessarily occu pied him with the histories and developments of matters maritime, headed him back on the tack he had started. Hence the stream of the ' general books,' as I have called them. It was a supply created by demand. In this field, if it may be so called, Keble Chatterton did more than any writer of his time to record British sea going achievements for the ' general reader.' From a Reader A London reader, Mr. H. W. Privett, sends me a most interesting letter of reminiscences from which he permits me to quote: — ' In Durban, where I had a house for about 18 years, I almost built a launch in which to use an engine and boiler from an old steam car. It was from a 'Loco mobile,' which was sold in London from a shop in Sussex Place, S. Kensington, in those days. ' Durban at that time (1904) had three yacht clubs— The Point, The Royal Natal, and Congella—with almost 200 boats between the three, and some 40 power launches. There was a yacht club at Louren9o Mkrques (Delagoa Bay). South and East African towns usually have sufficient harbour accommodation for a few yachts, even when they are not ports. The climate is more suitable for yachting than in England; there is more sun shine, the weather is more stable, and the water warmer.' The Skipper.rhe M otor B oat and F ebruary , 1945. Yachting 31 Yowr New Boat Wil More From Behind the Office Door By Norman H. Loveless THAT new boat you are planning to build when the war is over must cost you more than it would have done in pre-war ''ears. Yes, but how much more ? For an answer let us look behind the office door at two partners in the boat building industry and listen to their conversation. They have this and other important questions very much in mind and would like to be certain of the position when the fighting is done. This particular office is much the same as all other boatbuilders' offices : free for all, from prospective clients to Government inspectors, commercial travellers, and that essential indi vidual, the British workman. The partners, Bill and Sam (we may have met them before in these pages), are engaged in the usual morning con ference over a cigarette. The mail is open on the desk. Bill ; What is in the mail this morn ing, Sam? Sam : We have another post-war inquiry, and, for our peace of mind, the information that a cost investiga tor will call next week for the purpose of, etc., etc. Bill : Nice of him to look in. Sam : Yes, isn't it! They have a nice way of bringing sunshine into our harassed lives. Bill : The post-war inquiry sounds much more interesting. Sam : Yes, it does. A fellow is think ing of having a boat built on similar lines to our last peace-time job, ' Sun downer.' Of course he wants to know how much it will cost. Bill : So do we ! Sam ; Quite ! But we can hardly tell him that; as a matter of fact he is wondering if costs will be up much on 1939 figures. Bill : Good heavens! Well, I know of one very good reason why costs will be up after the war. We built ' Sun downer ' at a cut price to get the work, and it is safe to say that every other boat launched before the war was built at a cost which left, if any, a very small margin of profit. We are not going to gamble with bankruptcy again if we can help it. Sam: No ! We are decided on that point. But everybody seems deter mined to cut us down as much as pos sible. I wonder what the managing director of one of the big motorcar manufacturers would say if some bright individual walked into his office and tried to bargain for a car at £20 less than the market price? Bill: 1 haven't the faintest idea; perhaps my mind is too pure. Sam : The same thing happens to us. However, we can get a fair opinion of what boat construction will probably cost after the war. According to my way of working it out prices will be up something like 50 per cent. Bill : It depends on a number of things, especially wages. Sam : Exactly ! Let us take the items in order. First we are not going to lose money to keep work in the yard. We are going to build at a fair price. Now, take materials. Timber. We have on timber increases ranging from 50 per cent, to well over 100 per cent, on peace-time figures. In view of the tre mendous demand that there will be for timber after the war, which will call for some sort of price control, we need not expect any drastic alteration, either up or down, on present-day costs. I think we can safely say that available timber will be about 80 per cent, above 1939 levels. Bill : Yes, I think that is about as close as one can get to it. On the other hand, non-ferrous metals and fasten ings show very small rises. Sam : Yes, and we need expect little alteration there. Of course, boat fit tings, wrought ironwork, and so on, show substantial increases, these items being closely related to labour costs. Bill : Engine prices are very much in the air at the moment, but people in the trade are talking around a 50 per cent, rise on old figures. Sam : Exactly! If we draw an aver age between the comparatively high costs of timber, almost pre-war prices of non-ferrous metals and fastenings, probable costs of fittings and motors, it will be found that the increase on materials is in the near region of 50 per cent, above pre-war prices. Now, let us consider wages and work ing expenses. Possibly these will come down when the war ends. Bill (With some heat): It is always the old story. How can we reduce overhead expenses? When we talk of overhead expenses we are usually considering managerial salaries; as if anybody ever drew more than a mere pittance out of a boatbuilding busi ness. Bread and butter costs the same to us as it does to any other individual; and please don't forget that cigarettes, necessary for the preservation of sanity in a boatyard, are up roughly 133 per cent, and not likely to come down. I 'll bet that inquirer of ours pays the extra cost without turning a hair; even if he is only a light smoker getting through 20 cigarettes a day it must cost him about £70 a year, against £26 be fore the war, yet he wonders if his boat will cost him more. Why not ask the Corporation to reduce the rates? Sam : That is a bright idea! Town planning and so on will push the rates up. Well, as there doesn't appear to be any hope of reducing our running expenses, we can only examine labour costs. The point is, how will wages stand after the war? Bill : Perhaps we had better ask the British Workman what he thinks. I can hear old Joe coming up the stairs. Old Joe, the yard foreman, comes in as he speaks, turning the door handle with one hand, and, as a matter of form, rapping the panel with the other. Sam : Come in, Joe. You are just the man we wanted to see. Joe : Aye, that's what I thought, guvn'r. Bill : We were just discussing pro duction costs after the war, Joe, and we were wondering what will happen to wages. Joe : Go up a lot, I hope! Sam : What do you seriously think? Joe : Well, guvn'r, wages are a good bit higher than they were before the war, just about half as much again, I should think, leaving aside produc tion bonuses. As the purchasing power of a fellow's pay is no more than it was before the war, and not likely to alter much, I should think that wages will stay for some time round about their present levels. Sam : We think that there will be a general increase in boatbuilding costs of about 50 per cent, over pre-war figures and we cannot see any way of getting it lower. Joe : We have all got to change our ideas about prices and everything else; it's no good thinking of what things cost before the war. Those days are gone and good riddance to them. You might say that the circum stances were beyond the control of ordinary man. Maybe you would be right, maybe nobody could help the bad times. Unfair competi tion for work is often at the expense of the employer and workman alike. Perhaps it couldn't be helped, but when this war is over we are going to have a new world, so they tell us, and we will, providing that everybody is determined on the matter. We must all have fair reward for our labours and expect to pay fair prices for the things we buy. You can't have a new world by cutting prices right and left. No, sir, not likely. c332 The Motor Boat and Y achting F ebruary , 1945. The Diesel Cruiser Competition Further Entries: (2) A 12'ton Motor Sailer Designed for Service in South Africa By A. C. Button, Cape Town I On this and the following pages are given the specification and plans of another entry in the '' Diesel Pleasure Cruiser of To-morrow' competition, for which the first prize was a Perkins 60 h.p. Diesel engine and reverse-reduction gear. The winning designs were published in 'The Motor Boat' for December. —ed.] Designer's General Remarks IT is reasonable to suppose that no man wants a 60 h.p. Diesel engine in a 40-ft. boat just for river and canal cruising, but a motor sailer that can cross the Channel and also cruise on rivers and the bigger English canals is a desirable type of craft. It is also a good thing if the boat is able to take the ground with safety. The essentials for any cruising boat are stability, seaworthiness and accessi bility of engines. The round-bilge type, with good beam and plenty of deadrise, and with as much ballast as possible on the keel, is my idea of a good motor sailer (L.O.A. 38 ft. 3 ins., L.W.L. 34 ft., beam 11 ft. 4 ins., mean draught 4 ft. 2 ins.). For canal and river cruising, if desired, the masts, being light and of the lowering type, can easily be aemoved and stored, together with their gear, also one anchor and chain and about half a ton of inside ballast could be left ashore. This would lessen the draught to about 3 ft. 9 ins., and the boat would be perfectly stable for such use, with a freeboard of under 3 ft. For those who want a deep-water sailing hull the draught can be increased to 5 ft. 6 ins. without any structural alterations. The space between the hull and the keel could be filled with reinforced concrete. She should then have 500 sq. ft. sail area. In view of the probable scarcity of good air-seasoned timber suitable for boatbuilding, the alternative materials seem to be stainless steel, iron, alu minium or a composite construction of resin-bonded plywood and one of the above metals. Unless first-class timber is obtain able, I must confess to a strong lean ing towards metal, with waterproof plywood bulkheads and decks for reasons of strength, and to be free of those bugbears of poor-quality wood— rot, leaks and worm attack. Steering. —For sailing especially, the twin steering wheels give full, unob structed view past the dinghy and wheelhouse, and proper control of the boat from a comfortable windward position on either tack. The steering leads would be shackled up to the wheelhouse as required. Engine con trol from the wheelhouse is optional from cockpit. Engine, —Perkins P.6M. 60 h.p. Diesel. Cooling .—By water drawn from outside of hull through large area strainer well under bilge but within reach for clearing. Exhaust.— Asbestos-covered exhaust pipe led up to water-cooled silencer (with exhaust inlet and outlet on underside), secured L ; dtt ISABELLA) i £ @ [ ! 1 ] a- J ' j The wheelhouse in elevation and plan. to after bulkhead above wheelhouse floor; then down by suitable steam hose to copper exhaust pipe running athwartship just under floor, leading slightly down and aft each end, and exhausting on both sides of hull above the waterline; the cooling water to be led into exhaust line at lower end of silencer. There is plenty of space in engine-room even for this powerful Diesel engine, which is accessible for attention while running without lifting the wheelhouse floor. The four-cylinder 12 h.p. paraffin wing engine would also be fairly accessible. This small auxiliary engine would have 2-to-l reduction and Bergius folding or automatic feather ing propeller. Engines, fittings and all flooring to be properly secured, so that in the event of a 'knock down' nothing will break loose. Estimated Speed as Motor Sailer with 4-ft. 2-in. Draught. —8.5 knots with 2-to-l reduction gear and three- bladed feathering propeller; cruising speed 7.5 knots at 30 h.p.; range about 500 miles on 100 gallons of oil. Estimated Speed as Motor Sailer with 5-ft. 6-in. Draught. —7 knots with 2-to-l reduction gear and two- bladed solid propeller (to line up behind stem post when sailing), or 7.5 knots with three-bladed automatic feathering propeller. Cruising speeds 6 and 6.5 knots respectively, at 30 h.p.; range about 400 miles on 100 gallons of oil. Sails. —Light and strong, tanned to protect from mildew, dark red or bronze. Lower main sheet to each quarter outside mizzen rigging made fast to bollards; weather sheet lies slack across deck through opening in rail. Included in Standard Equipment Bilge Pumps. —Powerful hand pump and belt-driven bilge pump, with flexible non-collapsing suction hoses; big strainers to be fitted on the ends of the hoses. Sea Anchors. —Voss type of tanned canvas. One with 6-ft. oak cross-bars 2 ins. by 4 ins., as sea anchor, and one with 3-ft. oak cross-bars li ins. by 2 ins., as drogue for hard running. Anchor Cables. —40 fathoms f-in. galvanized tested chain; 100 lb. anchor; 50 fathoms li-in. diameter best manila rope; 70 lb. anchor. Small Winch. —Starboard side, with gipsy on port side for rope. Lavatories. —Both above waterline, in watertight trays draining into waste. Electric Light. —Fitted throughout. Dinghy. —10 ft. long, with small out board motor. Gangway. —8 ft. long, with folding handrail one side. Comment | This should be a satisfactory craft lor the hard Cape of Good Hope conditions. The twin steering wneels and centreboard appear hardly justi- ned by utility; the double main- sheets also would be troublesome, and the sail area is too small. Most people would prefer a taller, all- inboard rig, which would eliminate the bowsprit and bumpkin. There is nothing to be gained by dis pensing with a boom on the main sail, Apart from these points, tne judges were favourably impressed with this design.— E d.]34 the Motor Boat Y achting F ebruary , 1945. A Spot of Engine-ro By G. Meyer I HAVE long meant to write some thing about the engine-room of a Motor Gun Boat, the inhabitants of this wonderful compartment of the ship, and the strange things that sometimes happpn there. Unfortunately, I cannot go into the details of performance and the tech nical characteristics of these engines, because they would be cut out. But you can obtain a certain amount of information from the M.B. and Y. Manual for 1943, which, in the chapter on Naval Motor Boats, tells you, among other things, that approximately 1,200 h.p. Packard, Rolls-Royce, and Sterling engines are the usual power units fitted in M.G.Bs. and M.T.Bs.; and that there are either three or four engines, according to the size and type of the boat. How many knots we make is, of course, one of the questions you want to ask. It is one of the questions I cannot answer, for I have never seen a published official figure. I can only rhapsodize about racing back across a flat North Sea in the early hours of a summer morning after a night off Ymuiden. I might also mention that we never failed to get amusement from the zealous action of the watchful citi zens of a certain port, who, for some time, on hearing the beat of our engines as we roared home from an operation, sounded the air-raid sirens. Various kinds of stokers. The engines are great, and so are the engine-room crews who man them. Occasionally, however, this little sphere of activity takes rather a humorous turn; but let me tell you That wonderful bumper annual. first of all something about the per sonnel of the engine-room. This little band of water-borne engine drivers consists of a Chief Motor Mechanic, sometimes another Motor Mechanic, and various kinds of Stokers. In the case of the rank of Stoker, you will notice the old name is retained for these chauffeurs of high- performance petrol engines, which, of course, need no stoking. The reason for holding on to the old name is prob ably best known to the present editor of K.R. and A.I. (King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions). K.R. and A.I. is that wonderful bumper annual which is such a fund of wag gish reading matter, that we all wonder at the action of their generous Lordships in presenting a copy absolutely free (and post free) to every ship and establishment of any importance in the Navy. We do not possess a copy ourselves, being built for speed and not for comfort. The Chief Motor Mechanic, though not a commissioned officer, is yet a Most Important Person, by reason of the excess of technical knowledge which he possesses over that of every body else, officer or rating, in the ship. Many times the Captain of a boat has to follow a course of action dependent entirely on the judgment and advice of this potentate of the engine world. The Chief Motor Mechanic, of course, knows that he is a Most Im portant Person, and like all other Most Important People, he cannot be hur ried. Accordingly, if you want engines for some reason or other, such as mov ing ship, he will produce an inex haustible variety of excuses: the carburetters are being cleaned on the Starboard Inner; while on the Star board Wing the petrol filters are being stripped down for inspection, etc., etc. You soon learn to give up the unequal struggle: you cannot manoeuvre suc cessfully on two engines on the same side, especially in a strong wind or tide, for all your screws turn the same way. The Chief is not unaware of this dilemma. The Chief is important in many ways. Although investigation of strange sounds from the engine-room might reveal that he was engaged on the repair not of the main engines but of his bicycle, yet he is the only person who will make you a first-class ashtray from an empty shell case to glitter on your wardroom table. To give you some idea of what can happen even in the best-regulated M.G.Bs., I will recount some of the events which occurred on last Christmas Day. There was a certain motor gunboat commanded by an officer who knew a lot about car engines, but not of high- performance marine engines. He argued there could not be a lot of dif ference between the two. At least he could make use of technical terms as if they really belonged to him; and besides this, he was a clever person. In common with all the other clever That's the answer to that one.'L February, 1945. The M otor B oat and Yachting 35 17 J v I • Li men of the world, he suffered from the differences of opinion of his fellows about this point. It happened that he had an ex tremely capable Chief Motor Mechanic in his ship. Besides great capa bilities with regard to engines, this Chief Motor Mechanic was an honest, stable person, a countryman who entirely disproved the idea that his sort of solidity was at its best on the land. He was really brilliant with the engines at times, and no emergency of which I ever heard found him lacking in ideas, or incapable of executing them. He also possessed initiative. The C.O. in question was inclined to make heavy demands on the engine- room, which worried the Chief, who found it increasingly difficult to give the right answers—the answers that were expected of him. Upon the Captain emerging on to the upper deck, the following sort of conversation would ensue. ' Start up. Chief. I want to move now to have a gun lifted.' The Chief thought this was pretty feeble as, like all well-trained engine-room personnel, he believed that the main engines con stituted the main armament, and so would reply respectfully; ' I'm afraid you can't 'ave any engines yet, sir. I'm patching up a cracked cylinder on one of the wings.' ' Well,' our hero would reply, ' you can do that under way.' 'Yes, sir, but under pressure the water will pour out and go all over the show, and. . . .' When the Base Engineer inspected bilges. ' The water will just have to go in the bilges,' the great man would reply, unperturbed. 'That's the answer to that one.' 'Aye, aye, sir,' the crestfallen king of the engine-room would reply, wondering what answer he would be able to produce when the Base Engineer Officer inspected bilges on the morrow. You can see that things were quite able to go from bad to worse, and the engine-room staff felt deprived of their right of producing technicalities for confounding Captains and First Lieu tenants searching for the true nature of any particular situation. This extra ordinary Captain, however, knew many of the answers himself, and was often triumphantly rounding off some ' little argument with: 'That's the answer to that one,' emphasizing this now famous assertion with a very knowing look and a flourish of the head which brought home to the other just how foolish he really was. At length Christmas arrived. It was a wonderful Christmas; everyone's prayer that they would be in harbour had been answered. But on this great day the Commanding Officer decided that he wanted to put to sea and do a speed trial, and the Chief was told to have his engines ready by a certain minute in the then very near future. As you may expect, he soon came forrard. ' I'm sorry, you can't 'ave engines just yet, sir,' he said, 'I'm seeing to a bearing at the moment.' This in itself was rather remarkable on Christmas Day; but the Command ing Officer, who was full of that spirit so ubiquitous at that season, merely said : 'Chief, I want to do a speed trial. Therefore I must have engines! That's the answer to that one, isn't it? ' A pained look crept across the Chief's face. It was a great pity, because a first-class spud fight was developing very well at that moment; and several Commandos who had been so unwise as to join in were being shown how to jump into the drink from the deck of an M.G.B., which was quite a change for them from landing- craft. The Coxswain routed out ' the tired wet sailors,' drummed the icy fact into their fuddled and heated brains that they were required for harbour stations, and then went up on to the bridge, saw that the wheel was '' hard- a-midships,' and, in Naval parlance, 'crashed' over it—that is to say, he went ' hard-a-ziz,' meaning he slept. The engine-room crew dis appeared down their hatch. The C.O. appeared and rang down 'Start Engines.' Nothing happened. He paced back and forth across the bridge, three paces this way, three paces that way. Four whole minutes passed by. The seamen on the upper deck began to grin and look sheepishly at each other. No sound came from below. The next moment the engine-room hatch seemed to have been transformed into the crater of an active volcano. Clouds of steam poured out through the narrow, circular opening, and mingled with these there welled up from below a huge lather of dirty grey foam. Suddenly there shot up through this aerated mass a streak of fire. Enshrouded in a frothy effervescence. which burst into coloured stars; this display was followed by another and yet another, and all were accompanied by a series of violent popping sounds, and enraged human voices from below. The scene resembled a cross between a Cuban gala day and a vol canic eruption. The C.O. turned grey, then white, and finally green, which harmonized with a flare that burst over the bridge at that moment, and even caused the somnolent Coxswain to lift an eyelid. All this was distinctly beyond the C.O.'s experience of the engine of a Super Jehu-8. What on earth was he to do? He was not going to lose face with his Chief Motor Mechanic. He rang down ' Motor Mechanic to report to bridge.' After a long, long time, the head of the engine-room appeared. He was completely enshrouded in a frothy effervescence; his hair and eyebrows had been singed away, and there was a strange look in his eyes. ' What in hell's name is going on there. Chief? I rang down for engines a quarter of an hour ago. What the devil are you covered in? ' The Chief looked down at himself; a musing sort of look came into his eye. 'It was a fire extinguisher, sir.

The C.O. began to evince all the I* h H 1 \36 signs of exploding, when suddenly, looking over the Chief's shoulder, he caught a most unwelcome sight. Indeed, what worse at such a moment? A visiting Admiral was walking down the jetty with the Captain of the base. The tide was high, the boats were on a level with the jetty, and the wretched craft in question was the inboard boat of the trot. Everything was set for a painful scene. The dignified old sea farer, whose face was a raw-beef red, called over: ' What the devil's the matter there, man? Are you supposed to be slipping for sea ?'' Our hero momentarily struggled for words; but not for long. He was not beaten so easily. 'Too much boost, sir.' Ah, here was a chance, the old boy thought. He might not know every thing about these new-fangled mechanical planks, but by gad, the old principles of seamanship still stood as sound as ever. the Motor Boat and Y achting F ebruary , 1945.

Correspondence (To the Editor of The Motor Boat) The Future of Motor Boating Sir,—In your Editorial in the December issue you gave a very excel lent review of the future prospects for the various boatbuilding organizations whose livelihood in peace-time is yacht building or the production of motor boats. The number of small companies engaged in this business is surprising, totalling about 600 to 700 boatyards! many of which, of course, are now flourishing owing to the war. It is obvious that with the coming of peace this prosperity will drop, unless the Admiralty put the Nelson touch and decide to win the peace as well as the war. I, therefore, appeal to the Admiralty to ignore the signal, ' Break off the engagement; post-war economy demands it.' Now, to win the peace for the boat building industry, there are two things that require immediate attention by the First Lord of the Admiralty. First, the construction of harbours around our coast, which are sadly lacking at most of our large seaside towns, such as Eastbourne, Hastings (one of the old Cinque ports which we have allowed to disintegrate through neglect), Rye (another Cinque port which requires repairing), and a host of other places all around our coast. These new harbours would serve a dual purpose as defence ports in war time for our Light Coastal Craft, and in peace-time as fishing, ferry and yachting ports and R.N.V.R. training ports. Secondly, &amp;11 the boatbuilding yards should have their colours kept flying by the Admiralty as far as is prac ticable until they are able to switch over to yacht and motor boat building. In this way a great increase in yacht ing and motor boating would take place, as our seaside towns have a very large population to draw on, only too anxious to have a decent yacht har bour similar to the American yacht harbours being built at all their sea side towns. The Royal Navy would also have its long-desired coastal harbours for defence of our shores, so vital to our safety from invasion in the future. It was for this purpose that the Cinque ports were built many years ago, but they have been allowed to decay. America, on the other hand, has been hard at work since 1930 building numerous coastal harbours. I, therefore, appeal to the Admiralty to help win both war and peace with a Nelsonian dual effort of this sort, giv ing vast employment to all seamen.— Yours faithfully, Fareham. J. R. Gould (Major). Shakespeare's Avon Sir,—When I wrote my article, 'Shakespeare's Avon,' for a recent edition of ' The Motor Boat,' I hoped it would be controversial, but I had no idea that it would evoke the criti cism of the manager of the Navigation Company. Apparently I am accused of mis representation and of casting gloom over the future of the Avon. My object was to paint a true picture of the river as it exists to-day, in which I believe I succeeded. With regard to the future, I do not profess to be a prophet, but I think it is an undisputed fact that our rivers and canals could be maintained more efficiently if they were controlled by the State, or by public bodies, instead of private companies. With .hat in mind, I suggested that the River Avon should be taken over by the Severn- Avon Catchment Board. I am quite aware that Evesham Lock is not on the Lower Navigation. On my map it represents the dividing line between the Upper and Lower Navigations and is clearly marked as derelict. According to Bradshaw's ' Canals and Navigable Rivers,' the exact length of the Lower Navigation is 28J miles. The date 1(538 is the one usually accepted as the year in which the river was first opened to traffic, but, natur ally, I have not access to such intimate documents as those possessed by the Navigation Company. Mr. Fisher seems to have allowed an unnecessary personal note to enter his criticism. In case he is under any mis apprehension regarding the fact that I was able to travel down his river in 1941-2, I would point out that I was serving in the R.A.S.C. within a month of the outbreak of hostilities, but was subsequently discharged asfkhruary , 1945 Th? M otor B oat and Yachting 37 medically unfit, and returned to my normal occupation, so that I feel quite justified in boating during my annual holiday.—Yours faithfully, J ohn H. S tables. Birmingham. Too Much Streamlining Sir,—I am encouraged by Col. Bayldon's letter in the January issue of ' The Motor Boat ' to give voice to a fear that has been growing in my mind for some time. The fear is that the designers of post war cruisers will be too greatly influenced by the lines of large American motorcars and will overdo the curves and streamlining of the superstructure. The inclination is there already and to a certain degree it is an improve ment on the dead straight lines and sharp corners of conventional design, but some designs are beginning to look like amphibious motorcars. This is a plea for appearance and has nothing to do with layout, etc. If we are going to own the little ships we have thought about for so long, please let them look like real little ships. i, and maybe i speak for many, have no wish for a craft that demands a yachting cap, double-breasted blazer with gilt buttons, immaculate white flannels and white shoes. i expect i shall be accused of being old-fashioned, out of date, unprogres- sive, etc., but this is my opinion, and, anyway, I am not even middle-aged.— Yours faithfully, A lan R ose. New Maiden, Surrey. The Author Protests Sir,—May I be permitted to register mild protest at your reviewer's some what inaccurate remarks anent my recently published book, ' The Log of a Sea Dog '? He writes that ' It contains a great deal more about Mr. Newgass's dog, ' Mr. Bruce,' than it does about yachts and the sea.' A rough check, which I am asking the publishers to be so good as to verify, if they can spare the time and deem it worth while, shows that there are some 98 pages, including illustrations, relat ing to boats and such, and 18 to dog. There is, admittedly, a certain amount of extraneous material designed to be of interest to the average reader, but the fact that the book embodies no less than one dozen good-sized articles that have been published in ' The Motor Boat ' itself, as well as items that have appeared in other publications associated with the sea, ought to speak for it in this direction. ' Still the sea does come into it,' your reviewer is good enough to admit, ' as it appears at times to have come into the motor cruisers the author has owned.' Despite its share of rough patches, i can recall no occasion, unless it be when the decks were in need of recaulking, when the sea came into ' Fantasy,' and I am wondering on what he bases his slightly dis paraging remarks. Other misstatements are that, ' After two seasons in ' Alhouette,' Mr. Newgass bought the motor cruiser 'Fantasy' ...' I had only had ' Alhouette ' for one season, whilst, in the sense that one would naturally take it, I did not buy ' Fantasy ' but had her built, both of which facts are evident in the context. Your reviewer places the book in the category of what he rather sneeringly characterizes as 'a veritable saga covering all that the crew did, saw, said and felt.' Though I think that's quite inapplicable to my book, is it not a condition that enters into most sail ing or cruising books, from Seligman's enthralling ' The Voyage of the Cap Pilar ' to your own ' Skipper's ' splendid ' Macpherson's Voyages '? —Yours faithfully, E dgar N evvgass. Steyning, Sussex. [The reviewer of the book makes the following comment.— E d.] Hard, indeed, is the way of a reviewer! The author has written a very pleasant book, full of human and historic interest, and far more to the taste of thousands of readers than any dry record of distances ' made good ' and barometric readings. For every individual interested in boats surely a hundred are interested in dogs such as ' Mr. Bruce,' who is pictured nine times, and whose per sonality lends its own special charm to the story. Electric Starters IN order to arrange for electric start ing of comparatively large Diesel engines, a new C.A.V. 7-in. type of electric starter has been developed, in conjunction with a 300 A.H. battery, with which it is capable of giving a lock torque of 230 lb./ft. at 60 degrees F. Under these conditions it develops 21 b.h.p., and the torque at engine cranking speeds of 100-150 r.p.m. is about 1,000 lb./ft. The starter is provided with an inertia engagement drive and smooth engagement of the pinion with the fly wheel is obtained by means of the special double solenoid switch unit. This switch unit is designed so that the pinion is engaged whilst a resist ance is connected in the starter battery circuit, and not until the pinion is in mesh with the flywheel teeth can the full power of the starter be obtained. When the engine starts, the pinion is thrown out of mesh by the acceleration of the pinion along the sleeve due to the increase in speed of the engine flywheel. The completion of the main solenoid circuit which cuts out the resistance is effected by a pair of contacts operated by the movement of the pinion, thus ensuring that the full power of the starter cannot be obtained until the pinion is in mesh with the engine flywheel teeth. Due to the cyclic variation in crank ing torque of an oil engine, there will be in certain cases a tendency for the pinion to move backwards and forwards along the sleeve and in some instances cause the pinion operating contacts to reopen. In order to prevent this set of conditions causing the resistance to be re-inserted in the circuit, a holding-on winding is arranged in the solenoid system to pre vent this, thus ensuring the satisfac tory operation of the starter on full power until the operating push is released. Once this has been released the correct sequence of solenoid opera tion is once more available. The new C.A.V. electric starter for Diesel engines.38 The Motor Boat and Y achting F ebruary , 1945. Motor Boating the 15 visits that I have made ^'to the United States, I cannot remember any more interesting than that from which I have recently returned. America to-day has now greater industrial capacity than at any time in her history. Most Americans are anticipating a period of prosperity last ing from three to 10 years after cessa tion of hostilities. The boat building industry expects to participate in this prosperity. The number of inquiries now being received by boatbuilders and engine and accessory manufac turers is proving that large numbers of people are interested in buying a boat of some kind as soon as they are free to enjoy the pastime again. Apropos this question of future busi ness, the Federal Bureau of Statistics some time ago published figures show ing the number of registered pleasure craft in the United States at the end of the 1942 season. They are as follows:— Licensed motor boats ... 350,000 Estimated value $525,000,000.00 (£131,250,000). Registered yachts ... 4,000 Estimated value $140,000,000.00 (£35,000,000). Sail boats ... ... 30,000 Estimated value $24,000,000.00 (£6,000,000). The above were the number of regis tered craft on Federal waters which comprise the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, the Great Lakes and the prin cipal rivers. Another interesting figure showing the enormous popularity of motor boat ing in America is the following number of small motor boats and sail boats registered on the inland lakes:— Inboards 50,000 Outboards 350,000 Estimated value $80,000,000.00 (£20,000,000). Sail boats 10,000 Estimated value $2,000,000.00 (£500,000). It is furthermore enlightening to learn, according to Federal Bureau statistics, that not less than $130,000,000.00 (£32,250,000) is spent every year by owners of motor boats in the upkeep and operation of their' craft. This works out at approximately 17 per cent, of the total value of the boats, showing that the repair, storage and upkeep of motor boats in the U.S.A. is indeed a lucrative business. £6} Million Worth of Boats and Engines in One Year To me it was not surprising to read in a recent report issued by the Depart ment of Commerce in America that they forecast that $25,000,000.00 (£6,250,000) worth of boats, marine engines and fittings will be ordered by By J. W. Shillan the public in the first year after the war has finished, and they compare this estimate with the $6,300,000.00 (£1,575,000) turnover in motor boats and marine equipment in 1940, and $16,600,000.00 (£4,150,000) in 1929. In view of the fact that when that peace era arrives, prices in America will be at least 25 per cent, more than they were in 1940, I am prepared to accept the $25,000,000 estimate as reasonable. 3,000 Builders in the Industry In 1941 the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers, Inc., stated that over 3,000 firms were regis tered with them as either builders, repairers of boats, or manufacturers of marine engines and equipment, and that they employed 62,000 people. After the war, outboard boats will undoubtedly predominate. The manu facturers of Evinrude and Johnson motors have greatly extended their manufacturing facilities to cope with war-time Government contracts, and other outboard builders have done like wise. There are several others who have never made outboard motors before but who will come into this field. Once the changeover to quantity peace-time production has been made—within 90 days from the cessation of hostilities and the release of manufacturers from war contracts—the regular produc tion peace-time outboards will be ready for delivery to the trade and public. It is anticipated that 90,000 outboards will be made by the American manu facturers in the first post-war year. An expansion of other types of boats is to be expected. Most of the builders in America have materially increased production to take care of their war time contracts, and, in a recent survey of the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers it was found that 75 per cent, of their members expect to make full use of their expanded facilities for some time after the war. 1 he amount of expansion varies con siderably. I know of a firm in the marine industry who, in 1937, had an actual turnover of $500,000. Last year their turnover was $43,000,000. One Diesel engine manufacturing concern has a turnover of $1,000,000 (£250,000) per day, representing a ten-fold increase over pre-war output It is anticipated that many firms who have entered the motor boat induBtry since the beginning of hos tilities, with the usual American enter prise and desire for expansion^ will endeavour to remain in the marine industry, but whether they will find it a profitable venture remains to be seen. In the outboard field, the policy of the Evinrude and Johnson Companies is to produce more and better motors in order to ensure lower prices and better value for their public, and with their world-wide organization they are keenly desirous of again collaborating with their pre-war distributors in the sale and service of their products. It is probable that they will have a very big start over any other manufacturers in America who may enter the out board motor field. As readers of ' The Motor Boat ' may know, th ) S. and B.B.A. and the Marine Committee of the S.M.M. andT. in this country have, for a long time past, been endeavouring to come to an arrangement with the British Govern ment so that all surplus boats, engines and other marine equipment shall not be thrown on the market, purchased by speculative and inexperienced dealers and then sold to a public ignorant of the right type of craft for a particular purpose. We do not want a repetition of the chaos that existed in 1919, when large quantities of surplus marine craft and other equipment were thrown on to the open market at low prices— largely to jobbing dealers—without being backed by any kind of service or advice as to whether these craft were suitable for the purpose that the even tual buyer had in mind. Question of Surplus Disposal No arrangement for surplus disposal has yet been entered into by the Ameri can Government. They have continu ally shelved the question. i had several conferences on this subject with Mr. Ira Hand, Secretary of the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers, Inc., also with other leaders of the American marine industry, including the editors of vari ous American motor boat publications. One and all agreed that what we were doing in England was the logical thing for them to do in America, and i understand from Mr. Hand that this problem had been put high on the agenda for the next committee meeting of the Association, and I am hoping, in the general interests of the trade and public, there will eventually be close collaboration between the Ameri can and the British organizations. I stressed the importance of controlling the disposal of all surplus boats and engines in the U.S.A. as well as those in Europe and other parts of the world. 1 he American builders of marine engines and craft, however, do notFebruary, 1945. The Motor Boat and Yachting 39 want war marine materials of any kind sent back to the U .S .A. Another problem which is engaging the attention of a number of the lead ing boat and engine manufacturers who enjoyed an export business before the war is the possibility of not only main taining, but increasing, that volume in the post-war era. This will largely depend upon the new economic set-up. If we have to rely upon the outright purchase of this new equipment, then it will be influenced by the amount of dollars available to the various coun tries who want to purchase that equip ment. It is generally recognized that large outboard motors of, say, 10 h.p. and more will have a limited popularity, and that the bulk of the demand in the future will be for units of, say, 6 h.p. and under. The big outboard, however, has been of inestimable value for various purposes in this war, par ticularly for landing and bridge-build ing craft. I was interested to learn of the situa tion which exists to-day in regard to Marinas. These have represented the foundation of the great popularity which motor boating has attained in the U.S.A. I discovered that, at the moment, even in war-time, 16 Marinas are under construction, whilst 26 more were under consideration, amongst them being a very modern Marina which will be capable of mooring and storing no fewer than 1,066 boats. Whilst the demand in America in the future will be for boats of 60 ft. and under, Mr. Wells, the well-known American naval architect, told me he was now working on designs of 24 boats each costing a minimum of $100,000.00. In these days of severe income limitations due to high income taxation, this statement is surprising, but it was explained by Mr. Wells that many wealthy Americans were now prepared to spend largely of their capital resources as they anticipated, through Government taxation, a big decrease in the wealth of the rich indi vidual in the future. A Post-war D -THE first shipyard in the United States to abolish riveting and to build large ocean-going ships wholly by electric welding was the Ingalls Ship building Corporation, and, at this yard a very large number of merchant ships and aircraft carriers have been built during the war. These builders have designed a somewhat luxurious Diesel-engined yacht for post-war service, and an illustration of this vessel is given. Mr. George G. Sharp, the well-known New York naval architect, has been respon sible for the plans, and, like the builders' big ships, she will be of steel and all-welded. Two 200 b.h.p. Diesel engines are installed in the yacht, which is 90 ft. in length with a beam of 21 ft. and a draught of 5 ft., and it is anticipated that her speed will be between 13 and 14 knots. The luxuries include air conditioning, a ship-to-shore telephone, a short-wave radio and television equipment. There will be facilities for showing motion pictures. The main saloon is a general living- room, combination lounge and dining- room, about 42 ft. in length, with a width of 19 ft. It will be provided with insulated Thermopane windows.

This has not proved the case, and much experi ment has been involved in devising a boat that will not capsize on hitting the water. The first airborne lifeboat, the Mark I, was very bluff and shallow but the design from which the greater number of these craft are at present being built is known as Mark IA, and was developed by Uffa Fox, the builder of racing dinghies. Following R.N.L.I. lifeboat prac tice, the designer has given the Mark IA a deck raised above the waterline, and sloping inwards, so that water coming aboard drains centrally and escapes via a drain slot. The length The propellers are visille forward of the trolley. of the boat is 23 ft. and her beam 5 ft. 6 ins. She has no decking at gun wale level, but inflatable fabric buoy ancy chambers are fitted, standing high above the bow and stern. These impart a self-righting tendency to the hull, and do much to afford shelter to the crew. Rowlocks for rowing, and a jib- headed trisail and a jib, the two sails(Above) The motors, looking forward. (Below) A stern view. F ebruary , 1945, having a combined area of about 80 sq. ft. are fitted as auxiliary canvas. The rudder lowers through a case, as also does the wooden dagger plate centreboard. The lifeboat's main propulsion units are a pair of Britannia 'Middy' motors, each rated at 4 h.p. These consist of twin-cylinder power-heads similar to those of the Britannia out board motors, and are manufactured by the British Motor Boat Manufac turing Co. The question of motor power gave rise to some concern. The conven tional type of inboard motor, even of the smaller class, was unsuitable for many reasons, and it was suggested that the engines should be placed in a forwaid position in the hull. This was agreed to, as the arrangement assists the weight distribution when being dropped. It was then that the Britannia 'Middy' was put forward for consideration: this engine was de signed to operate as an inboard The motor BOAT and Yachting The 4-h.p. ' Middy ' power unit. motor but with a vertical shaft drive, through bevel gears to the propeller, the complete drive unit being fitted immedi ately below the bottom of the boat. With this plant it would be possible to install the power head under deck level, whilst the propeller gear housings, although protruding below the bottom of the boat, would still give ground clearance to the carrying aircraft. Hence it was decided that the 4 h.p. Britannia '' Middy'' should be tried as the power unit, and it was further agreed that two engines should be fitted side by side in view of their low power and compactness. A ' loaded ' speed of not less than 6 knots was stipulated, and a range of 12 hours required from a maximum of 12 gal lons of fuel. In order to test the capabilities of the engines, which were not in produc tion, the British Motor Boat Manufac turing Co. agreed to convert and recondition a pair of second-hand engines for tests. This was done, and various trials took place which proved the suitability of the engines. The combination proved so successful that, due to the obvious delay before new engines could be produced, the British Motor Boat Manufacturing Co. were requested to obtain, by every possible means in their power, additional second-hand units for reconditioning and converting. Various municipali ties, who had been operating fleets of small pleasure motor boats in their boating lakes before the war, were approached, and a number of used Britannia engines were obtained. It was apparent that the boat would at times have to undertake quite long journeys, and to test the endurance of&lt;3 42 the engines and hull, as well as fuel consumption, a special endurance sea trial was arranged. The two engines were started at 6.15 a.m. and ran with out stopping until the evening. A Speed of 6 knots It was estimated at the end of the run, when taking the boat over the measured mile, that well over 6 knots were possible even when loaded to its proposed carrying capacity. Its suc cess was thus ensured, and in subsequent operational trips, long dis tances have been travelled and addi tional fuel has been dropped by parachute to the rescued airmen. Furthermore, some of the big bomber crews, totalling up to nine and ten men, have been saved by the airborne life boat. A larger craft is now in course of production, which through its low ground clearance will necessitate an alternative type of engine being in stalled, but to date all.airborne life boats which have been delivered to the Services have been powered with two small Britannia ' Middy ' engines. Details of the Britannia 'Middy' engine and drive are as follow : — Motor.—Twin-cylinder, 50.5 mm. bore, 40 mm. stroke, 165 c.c. piston displacement. Cylinders and pistons.—Cylinders cast in close-grained nickel iron, bored and honed. Pistons made of alu minium alloy, fitted with two com pression rings, gudgeon pins case- r /ie M otor B oat and Yachting hardened and ground; connecting rods phosphor bronze.

These units, which have integral propeller-gear housings below the power heads, as in outboard motors, are installed side by side in trunks sunk into the deck, in a forward posi tion. All their below-water portions are of bronze. Flexible metal con nectors unite the engine exhaust out lets to exhaust pipes built into the hull. Constructional Details The constructional details of these lifeboats are all of the lightest possible order consistent with adequate strength. The skin planking consists of an outer layer of fore-and-aft Honduras mahogany strakes W in- thick, and an inner diagonally laid skin of the same timber J in. thick, with calico between. The timbers are of bent rock elm, | in. by J in. spaced at 1| in. centres, and the bulkheads are of |-in. waterproof plywood. Reference to the constructional draw ings will show that the drop keel case extends nearly from stem to stern, and is in effect a deep keelson, greatly stiffening the hull. This keelson is of J-in. mahogany. The deck, like the bulkheads, is of ^-in. waterproof ply wood. The Thames and Severn Canal IN 'The Motor Boat ' for September, ' under the title '' A Plan for the Canals,' it was suggested that the Thames and Severn should be recon structed to give a through route to Sharpness Docks and Gloucester, so avoiding the dangerous Bristol Channel. As early as 1633 there was a plan ' For the Contryving of Navigation betweene the Ryvers of Thames and Seaverne.' The Act of Parliament eventually came into force in 1783, and the work was completed in 1789. It begins with a junction with the Stroudwater Canal at Wallbridge, and extends to Inglesham, near Lechlade, 30 miles 7^ chains. From Wallbridge to Sapperton there is a rise of 241 ft. in 7 miles. Sapperton to Siddington, 9 miles, and the Cirencester branch are level. From Siddington to the Thames there is a fall of 130 ft. in 13 miles. The canal is 42 ft. wide on the surface and 30 ft. at the bottom. Including; By R. G. R. Calvert, M.A. those on the Stroudwater Canal there are 57 locks between the Thames and the Severn, admitting vessels of 14 ft. beam and 70 ft. length. King George IV opened the canal in person, and John Ireland wrote in 1792: ' This canal may be considered as the most elaborate and stupendous work of art that perhaps any country has yet accomplished.' Receipts in early years varied from £4,400 in 1797 to £11,300 in 1841, Sketch map of the Thames and Severn Canal.Febkuary, 1945 when 89,000 tons of merchandise were carried. In this year the railway was opened to Cirencester, and the Thames Conservancy began to allow the river above Oxford to become derelict. This reduced traffic on the canal to 44,000 tons in 1881. No barge passed down the river to Oxford after 1855. Charges for pleasure craft on the canal were £2 10s. for passing right through and £1 10s. if the locks were not used. In 1882 a proposal was made to con vert the canal into an independent rail way. The Great Western Railway, to thwart this scheme, bought up the canal shares. Repairs Overdue The Thames Conservancy was pre vailed upon to improve the river in 1894, but by that time the reduction in receipts had brought the canal to a state of bad repair. Various attempts, some partly successful, were made to re-open through navigation. This cul minated in 1901 in the transference of the canal to Gloucester County Council under Section 45 of the Rail way and Canal Traffic Act of 1888. ' When a canal by default of the pro prietors has become unfit for naviga tion, the Board of Trade may issue a warrant transferring the canal to a local authority.' The County Council put repair work in hand, but had constant trouble through the summit section leaking. The canal was finally abandoned under an Act of Parliament in 1927. The chief source of trouble had been unusual. During wet periods springs burst through the bottom. Later, in dry weather, the water from the canal drained back through the openings forced by the springs. To stop this, pipes were laid into the springs, dis charging into the canal above water level. The writer visited the canal last year and discovered that one of these Tht Motor Boat and Y achting Inglesham Lock and Round House. springs overflows near the entrance to Sapperton Tunnel. Listening close to it one heard the eerie sound of water running somewhere deep in the bowels of the earth. A short section of the canal bed near the tunnel—probably much too short—had been concreted to keep it watertight. Sapperton Tunnel on the summit level (3,808 yds.) is in length second only to Standedge (5,415 yds.) on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal (scheduled Tarlton Round House. / 43 for closing by the L.M.S. Railway). Both its portals are very ornate; but some of the masonry has fallen (or been pushed over) into the canal. There would appear still to be sufficient water for some adventuresome person to make the passage in a canoe. He will find that the bottom takes the form of an inverted arch. After Thirty Years This canal, after 30 years of disuse, is remarkably preserved. The lock chambers are intact, some gates and sluices appear to be still workable, and it is the towing path rather than the canal bed that is overgrown. In several sections there is water. Inglesham lock presents the unusual spectacle of gates wide open at both ends. The Fairford road near Cricklade has been taken across without a bridge, several farm tracks cross similarly, and some one has deposited a load of tin cans in the bed near Cirencester. The Cots- wold scenery is charming throughout. The Thames and Severn Canal was joined near Cricklade by a short branch of the Wilts and Berks Canal (aban doned in 1914). If and when the Thames and Severn Canal is reopened, this branch might also be restored as a branch from the Thames and Severn Canal to the important industrial town of Swindon. An ususual feature on this branch near Cricklade is presented by the canal in a shallow tunnel, the rail way passing over it on the level, and the road going over both by a bridge. One cannot leave the Thames and Severn Canal without reference to the unusual ' Round Houses,' built for the accommodation of lock-keepers. Some are still in use as dwellings. At the Stroud end 7 miles of the canal are still .open. The reconstruc tion of the remaining 23 miles should present no great difficulty: and might well be undertaken, now that the Thames Conservancy has spent so much money on making the Thames really navigable up to Lechlade. ; J H. &amp; Jk, i Near Thames Head on the summit level.

The majority of the remaining engines were American. How could this position be improved when the war is over? In my opinion, the best plan would be to send out from Britain a specialized engineer not connected with nor interested in a par ticular firm or group of manufacturers, so that he could make a fair investiga tion of the market, its requirements, and the reason why the British manu- FROM reports in the Press, it would appear that the relations between the Argentine Republic and the Allied Nations are not as cordial as they might be, but it must be recalled that the people of the Argentine are definitely 'pro-Allied Nations' and that the friendship with England is a century old. The present Military Government of the Argentine Republic must realize that this friendship is to the advantage of both countres. The development of yachting in Argentina is of interest to British (Above) Adjoining the Club San Fernando. (Above) Sailing boats belonging to the Club Nautico Quilmes on the River Plate.

Their reputation vas, on the whole, high, and in view of the probable extensive development of yachting in Argentina after the war, it is hoped that the pre-war connections will not only be maintained but will become closer. There is still a good deal of room for improvement in regard to the propor tion of British engines installed in Argentinian yachts, and, for instance, in a rough analysis of 50 yachts owned IIEFPII (Above) The Yacht Club Argentina.46 facturer fails to obtain a larger propor tion of the orders. It may be suggested that, in order that the mission may not be too expensive, stationary engines be included in the programme. A general report of the findings of such an engineer, forwarded to all the British builders of marine and station ary engines, would, no doubt, be of the greatest value. The following particulars of the various yacht clubs in Argentina may be of value in this connection, but before describing the different clubs, it is well to touch on the geographical position of the city of Buenos Aires. It is situated some 100 miles from the sea, on the River Plate, which is the confluence of the big rivers Uruguay and ParanA, with numerous tributaries and a large delta near the city of Buenos Aires. Furthermore, although Argentina has an area of over 1,000,000 square miles, the total population is barely 13,000,000, and of this total 2,500,000 live in the city of Buenos Aires, the Government, business and manufacturing centre of the republic. In consequence, prac tically all yachting activities are centralized, the clubs described in this article being all within 40 minutes' train or car journey from the city. From time to time other clubs are started in the provinces, but at present they represent a very small proportion of the total. Also, not included in this article, there are many rowing clubs, some of which have a 'nautical' section, with moorings for members' yachts. Practically all yachtsmen in the Argentine are members of clubs, mem bership conferring many privileges, apart from good moorings. The cost of membership varies according to the club, anything from $100 to $1,500 (£6 to £100) entrance fee, and from as little as $5 (7s.) monthly subscription (plus a small mooring fee, according to space occupied). At most clubs these fees include, apart from moor ings, such service as removal of canvas covers on leaving the club and replac ing same on return, keeping the bilges pumped out when necessary at moor ings, and general cleaning. Apart from sheltered and safe moorings, most of the clubs offer such facilities as slips and covered-in space for overhauls and painting, where the owner can do his own work or avail himself of the club contractors, petrol pumps and water connections at the moles, as well as restaurant service, changing rooms, etc. Yacht Club Argentine (Y.C.A.) The premier yacht club of the country which recently celebrated its diamond jubilee, having been founded in 1883. It is interesting to note that many English names figure rhc Motor Boat and Y achting amongst the founders and early authorities. In this year's annual report special acknowledgment is made of the services to the club of a well-known British yachtsman, the late Charles Livingston, who visited Argentina in 1897 and became very attached to Y.C.A. Subsequently he acted for them in England, and in 1901 was nominated official delegate of the club, which position he held until his death in 1937. The present membership list, includ ing life, lady and active members, totals 1946. Except for a few club- owned craft, cutters, star class and dinghies, all the remainder are owned by members, and the total number at present on their register, including sailing, auxiliaries and powered craft, is some 350. All types and tonnages are included up to a 118-ft. yacht built by Camper and Nicholsons. Shortly work will be started on the club's new installations near Buenos Aires. There will be a yacht port, protected moorings, slips and work shops, apart from the club building proper. Fig. 1 shows the present Y.C.A. premises situated in the North Basin of the port of Buenos Aires, and, incidentally, one of the first objects that a traveller sees on entering the port from abroad. The installations include a slip and a large crane, which is used for lifting all but the largest yachts, and also for landing the club's 'Luscombe,' used in their seaplane training school. The Yacht Club Argentine have very fine club premises in Mar del Plata, the large seaside resort on the Atlantic coast, some six- hours' train journey from Buenos Aires. This building is shown in Fig. 2. Club Nautico San Isidro (C.N.S.I.) Situated half-an-hour's journey from Buenos Aires, and founded in 1910, this is one of the finest yacht clubs in the country. The illustration, repro duced from an aerial photograph (Fig. 3), shows part of the property, which, in addition to the club build ings, mooring canals, slips, tennis courts, includes a nine-hole golf course. There are some 130 privately owned yachts on the club's register. In addi tion, the club owns, for members' use, 20 sloops and a quantity of rowing boats. The number of active members is approximately 2,000. Club San Fernando (C.S.F.) This popular institution is situated at the town of San Fernando, some 40 minutes by electric train from Buenos Aires, with the additional advantage of the station being just in front of the club entrance. Its extensive properties include mooring canals, covered-in shed and slip for overhauls, mechani- F ebruarv, 1945 cal workshops with staff in attendanc6 every day, including Sundays and holidays, large club building with restaurant, dressing-rooms, lockers, etc. There are also tennis courts and sports fields. Membership, including active and lady members, 6,900. Mem bers' yachts on club register, 530. Rowing boats owned by club, from single shells to heavy types, 340. Fig. 4 shows one of the mooring canals and the old boathouse, now replaced by a new building. Fig. 5 shows another of the canals, as well as part of the ramp running to the water from the boathouse. Yacht Club Buenos Aires (Y.C.B.A.) Situated near the above club (C.S.F.) is a smaller but a most pro gressive institution, with a good pro portion of auxiliary sailing yachts amongst the 100-odd craft on its register. Total membership is 250. The club owns eight River Plate class sloops and a colleen, as well as 14 row ing boats. They have a very comfort able clubhouse and a good-size shed and slip for repairs. Tigre Sailing Club (T.S.C.) Founded in 1896, mainly by yachts men of British nationality, to-day has a mixed membership. So far back as 1904 the T.S.C. brought out colleens from Dublin Bay, the first to do so. Membership is just over 200, and there are some 60 yachts on the register, including sailing craft and powered boats up to 45 ft. Fig. 6 shows the clubhouse and part of the moorings. Club Nautico Quilmes (C.N.Q.) Founded in 1921. Membership, 700. Situated some 15 miles from Buenos Aires, on the bank of the River Plate, away from the delta, for which reason sailing craft predominate amongst the 40 craft belonging to the club and the members. Fig. 7 shows some of the Quilmes craft on the River Plate. Yacht Club San Isidro (Y.C.S.I.) Total membership, 450. Club craft, three sloops, one colleen and one snipe. Members' yachts, 80; about equally divided between sailing yachts and powered craft. Club Nautico Buchardo (C.N.B.) Membership, close on 1,000. Craft on register, 106. Club Nautico Sudeste South-east. Founded 1935. Mem bership, 75. Craft on register, 40. Between them the above clubs boast a membership of over 13,500 and a combined fleet of 1,470; figures which speak for the popularity of yachting in Argentina.^ J0. F ebkuarv , 1^45. Thr Motor Boat and Yachting 47 Naval Motor Boats Year In the official yearly review of Naval affairs published recently it was recorded that— ' The year 1944 proved the most suc cessful in the history of Light Coastal Forces. From the Frisian Islands to the Channel Islands our M.T.Bs. and M.G.Bs. have maintained an almost vir tual blockade of the German occupied ports in Holland, Belgium and France. Few, if any, enemy convoys were allowed to make even a short enemy passage unmolested. . . . The Battle of the Channel ended in complete vic tory for our little ships, a victory which was as important to the success of the invasion as the winning of the Battle of the Atlantic was to the war as a whole.' An Ami-vibration Union Fire can break out in a motor boat as the result of any one of many causes, such as the fusing of an electric wire, the dropping of a cigarette end, or the overturning of an oil stove; but the big blaze which it is almost hope less to try to extinguish arises nearly always from fuel that has escaped into the bilge, and usually it gets there from a leaking or broken fuel line. When first installed, good copper piping is so ductile it seems impossible it should fracture; but long continued vibration renders it crystalline and brittle to the point of being dangerous. Any tubing in metallic contact with an internal-combustion engine may suffer in this way, and, consequently, a device affording a vibration damping effect to pipe lines is a definite safety- factor. Such a fitting is the Clayflex flexible pipe union, made by Messrs. Clayflex, Ltd., of Stratford-on-A von. The device consists of a male-threaded nipple, having a gland nut over one end, containing a synthetic rubber gasket. On putting the end of a copper pipe through one of these unions of suitable size and screwing up the gland, the gasket grips the pipe with intense pressure, even compressing it to the extent of forming a waist, though no metal-to-metal contact is involved, and vibration cannot pass. These unions are made in sizes to fit ^-in., J-in. and T^-in. external diameter pipes, and are used extensively by the automobile and aeronautical industries. Sailing Yacht Construction A paper, entitled ' Sailing Yacht Construction,' was read on January 10 before the North East Coast Institu tion of Engineers and Shipbuilders (Students' Section) by O. M. Clem- metsen, B.Sc. The Equipment of 72-ft. M.Ls,. It is well known that very consider able numbers of 72-ft. general- purpose motor boats have been built for the Admiralty, known as M.Ls., and the equipment of these craft is naturally extensive. The illustration shows a set of such equipment supplied in hundreds by Simpson-Lawrence, Ltd., for a 72-ft: M.L. Although numerous special items are included, the majority of the fittings are standard S.L. equipment as supplied in peace time for yachts. New Temple Press Directors Mr. A. P. Chalkley, Mr. C. F. Cook, and Mr. J. G. Day have joined the Board of Temple Press Ltd. Each of the new directors has served with the company for a considerable number of years. Diesel Engines for Fishing Boats At the Scottish Fisheries Exhibition, held in Edinburgh last month. Provost Carstairs of Anstruther stated that he visualized the development of an inshore Diesel trawler as distinct from the existing steam-driven long-distance trawlers. The smaller boat would be designed to operate as a three-purpose craft for drift net, ring net and seine net fishing. He considered that this motor boat development, taken in con junction with the Herring Committee Report, should, if properly handled, mark the biggest advance yet made.

The owner of the motor yacht ' Lugworm' wishes to put her in hand for repairs and for certain minor modifications. In the bad old days, of course, there would have been no difficulty about this. The owner, a regular customer of Botchers' Boatyard for years, would have handed her over to old man Botcher with a few brief notes about what was required and an injunction to advise him as to any further work found necessary to make the craft serviceable. On the other hand, he might have thought to himself: ' Last time Botcher made rather a mess of my refit; Knott and Shake have a pretty good name these days, I think I'll turn the job over to them.' Obviously, such a simple procedure could not possibly be sanctioned in these days of systematized complica tion. First of all, the owner has to apply to the National Yachting Authority for a Refit Permit. The application will not be considered unless it is made (in quintuplicate) on the correct form. No. NYA 6455/R, which is obtainable on application from the Ministry of Paper Economy. Applications for the application form must be made on Form QB3/Y/1065, obtainable from any Post Office. In the unlikely event of the Refit Permit being granted, the owner is required to send it to the Regional Yachting Controller for his district, together with an application (on Form KBO/BBB/Y) for allocation of the work. After much additional correspond ence—life is too short to describe it all in detail—the owner of Lugworm' has emerged successful from this pre^minary campaign of obstruction. He has been informed by his R.Y.C. that the refit has been allo cated to the Limbo YachtbuiMing Co., whose yard is located 100 miles from 'Lugworm's' heme port; he has also been instructed to sail the vessel there and to report to the R.Y.C. on its arrival. After waiting a forfnipht for reason able weather, 'Lugworm's' owner has carried out these instruct'ons. A month later he receives a communica tion from the R.Y.C. to the effect that it is intended to hold a conference on the refit of 'Luewo'rm' at the office of the Limbo Yachtbuilding Co. at 10.30 on the 13th orox. And now we come to the conference. The Regional Yachting Controller is in By 'Coracle' the chair. Others taking part include a representative of the National Yachting Authority, the District Yacht Repair Supervisor and his construc tional, mechanical and electrical technical specialists, the manager of contractors and his ditto, officials of the various trade unions concerned, . and the local committee of the Con solidated Yachtbuilders' Association. Oh, and the owner of the yacht. The Defects List is read out. This is it: — M.Y. ' LUGWORM ' Defects 1. Door of cocktail cabinet cracked. 2. Lid of vegetable locker broken. 3. New catch required for galley door. 4. Port after fairlead broken. 5. Plug of wash-basin in forward toilet compartment defective. 6. Carpet in owner's stateroom requires renewal. 7. Stem, keel and sternpost defec tive; to be renewed. 8. Planking defective, port and starboard; boat to be completely replanked. 9. New main engine required. The R.Y.C. then asks the contrac tors' manager to give his estimate of the time required to complete the job. The C.M. says that in view of his present commitments at least 12 months will be required. A frown from the R.Y.C. and a gasp from the owner cause him to qualify this state ment by offering to comolete the job in six months provided that items 1 to 6 inclusive are cut out. The owner objects strongly, saying that if these items are deleted the yacht might as well not be put in hand at all. A great deal of irrelevant talk ensues, and, in the end, it is grudg ingly agreed that items 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 shall be attended to, and nine months allowed for the work, subject to an indefinite extension in the event of unforeseen delays. The List of Alterations and Addi tions is then produced and read : — M.Y. ' LUGWORM ' Alterations and Additions 1. Chart table in wheelhouse to be raised 18 ins. 2. Signal mast to be reduced in height by 12 ins. 3. Coach-roof of owner's cabin to be raised 6 ins. to give full headroom. 4. Funnel to be provided for exhaust, in lieu of side exhaust. 'Now, as you all know,' says the R.Y.C., 'the National Yachting Authority has ruled that only those Alterations and Additions which can be carried out within the time allowed for the repairs may be under taken. I take it that that rules out Item 1.' 'Oh, definitely,' agrees the con tractors' manager. 'Now, Item 2,' continues the R.Y.C. 'What is the object of this request?' 'I have obtained a berth on the landward side of Sagging Bridge,' replies the owner, 'and wish to be able to pass under the bridge without taking down my mast or waiting for Low Water Springs.' The N.Y.A. official consults three books of reference. ' There is no official approval for such a modifica tion in yachts of the class to which 'Lugworm' belongs,' he says. 'Strike it out!' commands the R.Y.C. Item 3 then comes up for discussion. 'May I suggest,' says the D.Y.R.S., after a whispered consultation with his assistants, '' that a more rational way of obtaining the extra headroom required would be to increase the draught of the yacht by 6 ins. and to lower the cabin floor. Raising the coachroof would completely spoil her profile. 'A very sensible suggestion,' agrees the R.Y.C. ' Re-word Item 3 accordingly,' 'Now, Item 4,' he continues. 'Why do you wish to have the exhaust altered, owner?' 'Well,' replies the owner, 'the exhaust outlet is at present in the port side of the yacht, and when I am pro ceeding with the wind on that side the fumes are blown back into the wheel- house and cabins.' 'A childish and totally unnecessary request,' comments the R.Y.C., sharply. ' The obvious thing to do in such circumstances is to turn the vessel round and proceed astern. Strike out that item ! Well, I think everything is now settled. Any further comments?' The owner responds to this invita tion by attempting to inquire how much the job is going to cost, but he is interrupted and sharply reprimanded by the Regional Yachting Controller, who tells him not to waste the,valuable time of all the busy people present by asking frivolous questions. This terminates the proceedings.THE WALTON YACHT WORKS LIMITED, WALTON BRIDGE. SHEPPERTON, MIDDLESEX. WALTON-ON-THAMES 2727 The illustrations show a standard pre-war WALTON 37 foot model.

G. M. Osborne 49 WHAT pleasant memories of our first visit the name Pin Mill brings back! We were cruising in a 30-ft. power boat, and had spent the previous week making our way leisurely up the East Coast from the Thames, exploring Burnham, Brightlingsea and Walton en route. Each had been interesting in its different way, ranging from the forest of masts and countless craft moored at Burnham to the quiet back waters behind Walton with their numerous creeks meandering between the mud flats. The previous night had been spent in Felixstowe Dock, moored alongside a tug, and it was pleasant next morn ing to get away and out into the broad waters of the Orwell. The flood was running strongly and soon Shotley was passed and the cluster of shipping in Butterman's Bay. As we made our way upstream so the scenery improved, the flat shores giving place to rounded hills, and soon our ship was riding to her anchor among a number of small craft at Pin Mill. It was not long before we had landed at the hard to explore the neighbour hood. First, a few cottages and the well-known Butt and Oyster Inn, and then, leaving the road which leads up to the village of Chelmondiston, we climbed the hill on our left, and were (Above) A view from the road. (Left) Looking up-river. soon looking down on the anchorage and the wide sweep of the river below. Returning to the river front, we crossed a narrow stream by a bridge made by the simple expedient of laying a barge's leeboard across it, into the well-wooded Woolverstone Park. Here a path, which follows the river, led us past wide flats covered with the beautiful mauve sea lavender. In places we had the river on one side and quite a respectable cliff on the other. A scramble up the latter was rewarded with a bird's-eye view of the river and the country on the farther shore. We made our way back to the dinghy by a different route, and returned aboard having confirmed all that we had heard of the beauty and peace to be found at Pin Mill.50 The Motor Boat and Y achting F ebruary , 1945 [ IM THE FAIKWAY Comment on Current Topics by Icarus The Impulse Starter Most of us know that the impulse starter works by holding up the rotation of the magneto, as the engine is swung, and then, as the firing point is reached, sud denly freeing it, to revolve more quickly, so that a powerful spark is produced without the necessity of that quick pull-up on the starting handle, which some of us, lacking either the strength or the knack, find difficult to accomplish. But even an impulse starter needs humouring, as the experience of a friend goes to show. He had trouble with his reverse gear, and cahed in the aid of a mechanic to make the necessary adjust ments. These made, a test under running conditions was called for, but, to my friend's astonishment, for hitherto it had always been most amenable, the engine refused to start. For an hour that mechanic worked, trying this and that, and swinging tne starting handle unt.i his arm ached and the sweat dripped from his brow, without result. The engine steadfastly refused to produce even the proverbial kick. Confessing himself beaten at last, the mechanic pre pared to return to the shore, promising to report matters to his boss and to see what he could suggest. As he was collecting his gear, my friend, sorrowfully, almost wist fully, took hold of the starting handle and pulled the engine over compression. Instantly it sprang into life, purring like a well-fed, contented cat. The moorings were slipped and the trial run made, and the reverse gear proved satisfactory. Then, once more on the moorings, the engine was stopped and the puzzled mechanic carried out a series of experiments, in the course of which he discovered that when the engine was pulled slowly over compression it started every time, but it resolutely refused to respond to a quick pull-up, the speed, apparently, rushing it past compression point so quickly that the delayed action of the magneto failed to produce the spark in time tor the crucial moment. As the mechanic, his face wreathed in smiles, again packed up his gear he confessed that it was ' a new one on him.' To be honest, it is a new one on me. J Progress of the Little Ship Club The valuable work carried out by small craft during the war came in for further commendation at the annual dinner of the Little Ship Club last month, when the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham, who certainly has reason to know what they have accomplished, stated that the little ships had had to fight continuously and bitterly for the control of the Channel, and that 'the successful landing of the large invasion armies in France was the measure of the victory of these small craft.' Admiral Stark, who is Commander-in-Chief of the American Naval Forces in European waters, spoke in much the same strain, and confessed to a soft spot in his heart for little ships ever since he sailed his first canoe with the aid qf an umbrella! Lieut-Comdr. Luard, the President of the Club, was in the Chair, and he presented Dr. Harrison Butler with a marine painting in commemoration of his year of office as President ot the Club. Dr. Harrison Butler, always modesty personified, said it was fitting that the new President should be a real yachtsman. » It was an international gathering of some 250 people (I understand that 500 tickets were applied for and that probably 1,000 could have been sold), and, in addition to the Admirals responsible for the British and the American Fleets, the heads of the Norwegian and Netherlands Navies were present. Can anyone doubt the value and national importance of the Little Ship Club when it is recorded that out of some 1,800 members—a far larger number than any other yachting club in this country—some 500 have commissions in the Royal Navy? Hitherto the Govern ment and the Admiralty have only recognized the exist ence of yachtsmen when wars come. Should we not take full advantage-, in days of peace, of what yachts men have accomplished, when we ask for reasonable recognition of yachting by the authorities? Returning again to what the Little Ship Club has accomplished, it must also be remembered that the 50,000 Sea Cadets who wi.l probably foim the backbone of the Royal Navy and the Merchant Marine in the coming years have largely been trained by officers who are members of the Cmb, Those who love the sea are unassuming people on the whole, but it is necessary for us to keep facts like this in mind if we are to get fair treatment in the future. And we should let the public know about them. Well! Well! In a lecture before the Educational Institute of Scotland recently, Mr. Thomas Johnston, who is Secre tary of State for Scotland, compared the skill and intelligence of English and Scottish workers, much to the disadvantage of the former. He said:— ' The Managing Director of a large firm in England who inspected the Sea Cadet units for the Admiralty reported that he had been to over 400 towns in Scotland and in England, and he could say with absolute sincerity that they had got far more talent in Scotland than they had ever heard about in England.' I suggest he repeats this statement before an educa tional congress in England. More Readers Inquire The ' Readers' Inquiries' page has always been popular in ' The Motor Boat,' and apparently as the war (presumably) draws to its close larger numbers of readers are inquiring. I am informed that last year 878 such requests for information were answered by letter, compared with 780 in the previous year, and in addition much information was given by telephone—a means of investigation which I understand is not viewed with great favour.(Right) At the Presentation Dinner in connection with The Motor Boat' design competition.

The Editor of ' The Motor Boat ' was in the chair and Mr. F. Perkins made a token presentation of the 60 h.p. Perkins engine (the first prize) to the winner, Lieut.-Col. R. Cromie, F.R.I.B.A., whilst Mr. John Bain, M.I.N.A., managing director of James A. Silver, Ltd., received the second prize. A very interesting series of speeches dealing mainly with the future of motor boating and the relation of motor boats and the motor boat industry to the Services, were made by Vice- Admiral F. A. Sommerville, R.N. (who has been so closely associated with the supply of air-sea rescue boats). Air Commodore R. F. Osborne, of the Air Ministry, Mr. W. A. Tookey, of the Ministry of Supply, around whom centres the allocation of a large proportion of the internal-combustion engines built during the war, Mr. F. A. Perkins, Capt. A. J. M.

Dangerfield, managing director of Temple Press Ltd., Mr. Claude Wallis, managing direc tor of Iliffe and Sons, Ltd., Lieut.-Commdr. Scott Hughes, one of the judges of the competition, and the chairman. A 16-in. model of the winning design was presented to Capt. Richardson on behalf of the pub lishers of ' The Motor Boat.' Various facts of much interest were mentioned, but ' not for publication,' as the function was entirely informal; it may, however, be recorded that reference was made to the exceptional amount of interest being shown in motor boating by men in the R .A.F. Club Revivals Whilst some of the yachting clubs, such as the R.O.Y.C. and the Little Ship Club, have maintained a certain degree of activity during the war, others which have been more or less dormant are, I find, making preparations for the resumption of activity. I think they have a greater part to play in the development of yachting and motor boating in the future than in the past, on account of the very large number of newcomers who will, undoubtedly, be attracted to the water. The task of guiding them in the right direction is one of some importance, both for the people themselves and the yachting movement. Hence I would suggest that all of our motor boating clubs commence their prepara tions for post-war activity as soon as possible. There is a great deal to do, and it is essential to ensure that the clubs are under the right control, namely, that the officiating officers, the committee and the secretary are real enthusiasts, who are not afraid of putting in a great deal of time and work in order that the clubs may make a successful start. The view has often been expressed in the editorial columns of this journal that clubs will play a far greater part in the development of motor boating and yachting than in most other sports, and this is, perhaps, largely due to the fact that they are able to give assistance to those who are new to the game. There is this point, too. The yachting fraternity as a whole has not received a square deal from various authorities, local and national, and it is only possible to give effective weight to the point of view of the boat owner when he is combined with others, so that his case can be put with greater numerical force. Mr. John Bain, M.I.N.A., winner of the Second Prize. The Diesel Cruiser of To-morrow The Presentation Dinner in connection with ' The Motor Boat ' Diesel Cruiser of To-morrow competition was a very pleasant affair.

Wild leaps to the heights have followed precipitous plunges to the depths in rapid succes sion, so that, at times, it has almost seemed as though the barometer were following the weather instead of antici pating it. A few days ago, my aneroid, after falling five-tenths in a night, shot up six-tenths the following day, with a further rise of three-tenths during the succeeding night. Standing in a bus queue the next day, I got into con versation with my neighbour, an elderly man in plus-fours, and, as is usual on such occasions, our opening topic was the weather. I commented on the heavy fall and even more rapid recovery of my glass. He listened with a superior, almost pity ing, smile. Stuck! 'Ah,' he said, shaking his head knowingly. 'My barometer never moved. Never moved, sir. And it hung in my father's cabin in his ship for over 20 years, so it's to be relied on.' He was so pleased by what he con sidered the fact that his barometer had refused to be taken in by the weather's vagaries that I had not the heart to suggest that it was obviously quite time that he had it attended to. The barometer is a much-abused instrument. The amateur's usual method of consulting it is to hit it two or three sharp raps with a hard knuckle and, having noted its reaction —a leap or plunge of injured protest— to decide that it is 'going up' or ' going down,' as the case may be. To be of use, the barometer must be understood. Its job is to tell the weight of the atmosphere, or atmo spheric pressure. At sea level, this is roughly, just under 15 lb. to the square inch. In its most primitive form, a barometer may be a piece of glass tube, 33 ins. or a little more in length, which is sealed at one end. This tube, filled to the top with mercury, has been capsized into an open bowl, into which a certain amount of mercury will have run out, but if the end of the tube was kept well down in the bowl, so as to be below the surface of the escaping mercury, it will only have been a small quantity, and a column, some 30 ins. high, will be standing in the tube, the pressure of the atmo- By Percy Woodcock sphere on the mercury in the bowl pre venting any more from getting out. The weight of the atmosphere varies with the weather. Roughly speaking, the air is heavier in fine weather, so more of the mercury is forced back into the tube and you get what is known as 'a high glass.' In bad weather the air is lighter, allowing more mercury to run out, and you get 'a low glass.' Other Types A barometer such as I have described will seldom be found outside the science-master's room at school. In a normal instrument, instead of the bowl, the tube is bent round in the form of a U, and the pressure of the atmosphere on the open end prevents the mercury from overflowing. A scale, marked in inches, is fixed on a level with the top of the mercury in the upper part of the tube, so that the actual height may be read off, and there is an adjustable marker, to show the last reading, so that any movement that may have taken place is at once apparent. Another form of this type of barometer is shaped 'something like a banjo. It has a round, clock-like face, but is marked with inches—probably from 25 to 31—instead of hours, and it has a hand to show the movement of the mercury, and another adjust able one, turned by a milled nut or knob on the hub, by which the last reading may be recorded. One such barometer stood in the hall of an hotel at which I often stayed in days gone by, and the manageress had the habit of resetting this recording hand at 7 a.m. when she descended in her dressing-gown to see that the staff had mustered for the day's work. This was annoying, for it meant that unless you had made a mental note of the actual height at which it stood the previous evening, you had no means of telling what it had done during the night, but only knew its movement between 7 a.m. and whatever time you yourself mustered for breakfast. The face dial is worked in a simple manner. A weight, attached to a counterpoise, rests on the mercury in the open end of the tube, and the con necting cord passes round a wheel at the back of the face, to which the centre of the indicator hand is fixed. A barometer of this type should never be laid flat. I well remember my father's annoyance when a new maid —emulating a new broom—unhooked ours from its place on the wall in order to dust behind it, laying it down on the hall table while she did so. Being at that time a small boy, I derived great amusement from trying to pick up the small globules of mercury which had scattered over the floor. Probably the commonest form of barometer in these days is the aneroid, which, as its name implies, has no mercury, but a vacuum chamber, and so is by far the best for use afloat. It consists of a small box of very thin metal, which has been emptied of air so that, except for a small spring, which keeps it from collapsing altogether and helps it to register, its interior is as near a vacuum as may be. The atmosphere presses on the sides of the box, which give-and-take a little in response to the variations in its weight, and a simple mechanism records these movements on its face, which is exactly similar to that of the banjo type. With the passage of time, the read ing may vary from that shown by a mercurial barometer, getting a little higher or a little lower, as the case may be, but this error may easily be corrected by turning a small screw, which will be found deeply sunk in a small hole in the back, till it agrees with some standard instrument. This is not really important, as it is the movement that counts, in weather pre dicting, rather than the actual height. As an Altimeter As might be expected, the height of the reading varies with that of the barometer's position, for on a mountain there is, of course, less air above it to weight it down than there is at sea level. Aneroids may be had as small as watches, and it is interest ing to watch one when ascending in a plane, or even a high lift, such as that in the Blackpool Tower, or some of the funicular railways in Switzerland. The baragraph is simply an aneroid barometer, connected to a revolving cylinder of graduated paper, on which its readings are recorded by a pen in a continuous line. This is a great con venience for a man who, say, joins his ship at week-ends, and has been too far away, or too busy, during the week to keep a watchful eye on the glass. What the glass has recently been doing is just as important as what it is doing at the moment in forecasting what the weather is likely to do. Generally speaking, a barometer is affected more by wind than by rain. A steady barometer indicates that there will be little change in the weather and the prevailing conditions will continue. Actually, an absolutelyw y u February, 1945. steady glass shows a little give-and- take, maybe about half a tenth, during the 24 hours. It stands highest at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. and lowest at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m., Greenwich Time. A rising barometer usually indicates less wind; a falling barometer more wind. Slow movement indicates settled weather; quick movement unsettled, changeable weather. A rapid fall is a bad sign, and a rapid rise after low may indicate a strong wind from a northerly quarter. A fairly low barometer that is slowly rising is a better sign than a high one that is sharply falling. A barometer's highest readings will be with a north-east wind. It reads higher during northerly and easterly winds than during southerly and westerly winds. Some of these rules have been The Motor Boat and yachting recorded in doggerel rhyme— Quick rise after low, Fortells a stronger blow. Another couplet puts it a little differently— When rise commences after low Squalls expect and then a clear blow. This sums up what happens when the centre of a depression passes and the wind veers to a northerly quarter. Heavy squalls will follow for a time, but will gradually fine away. Glass high—heave short and away. Glass low—let your anchor stay. Glass shifting—reef tackles prepare. Glass steady—make sail without fear. When the glass falls low Prepare for a blow. When it slowly rises high Lofty canvas you may fly. 53 - At sea with low and falling glass Soundly sleeps the careless ass. Only when it's high and rising Truly rests the careful wise one. Long foretold—long last. Short notice—soon past. The last couplet is very true. The gale that gives long notice of its com ing is likely to last longer than one which comes on with little warning. As I said before, a barometer must be understood. One old chap I knew used to puzzle me at times as his glass was often doing the direct opposite of mine. Then, one day, being with him when he hit his glass the ritualistic crack, I discovered that he thought it stood highest when the hand was in a vertical position, so that he often thought It was falling when it was actually rising, and vice versa. The scale meant nothing to him. t t r y -A I Plastic Stern THE word 'plastics' is usually connected in one's mind with some what brittle, moulded objects of small size, or with waterproof plywood; but there is a third class of plastic; likely to become extremely important in engineering, namely, resin-bonded fabric, laminated into slabs as thick as 6 ins., and shaped by machining. The ' B.C.H.' water-lubricated bearing bushes for stern shafts, manufactured by Messrs. J. Burns, Ltd., of Chadwell Heath, are plastics of this variety, which, together with other products to be described, we recently saw in process of production. Laminated fabric is a substance somewhat like horn in appearance, at least as tough as brass, weighing slightly more than water, and contain ing 40 per cent, of phenolic resin. Use3 as both forward and outer bear ings in a stern tube, it has special advantages, which have been proved by continued service both in high speed Naval motor craft and in com mercial vessels. It needs no metal containing shell, and is moderately priced; moreover, even if absolutely the exact size is not ordered, the bush can be sandpapered down, internally or externally, to a push fit, being retained in place by a grub screw only. Ordinary bronze or steel shafting runs dry or water lubricated in these bushes with a minimum of wear, and though it can be supplied impreg nated with graphite, it is claimed that better service is obtained with the bush untreated. Grooves are provided along the bore of the bushes, into which suspended mud and sand t Water-lubricated sleeves. separate, and, by leading a small branch pipe from the engine's cooling system to the stern tube, all such sedi ment can be driven from the collecting grooves as quickly as it accumulates. Besides these water-lubricated bear ings, Messrs. J. Burns make a con siderable number of small components of interest to small craft users. These include impellers for circulating pumps which will stand a temperature of 90 degrees C. for long periods, and even 150 degrees C. for a short time. If the pump should dry out they will take no injury. Other items are pulley sheaves. These, while as light as many non-ferrous alloys, are much less wearing to steel ropes, and need no lubrication, so they are suitable for yachts' blocks, which give so much trouble through the wear on pins and the corrosion and sticking of sheaves. Shaft couplings are made of this material, gear wheels, and many sizes of small bearing bushes for the spindles of machinery controk, also for electrical insulation. From this description of the 'B.C.H.' material and its present applications it may be judged well suited to take the place of lignum vitae, wherever that intensely dense wood has formerly been employed. It should therefore be highly suitable for rope fairleads, cleats, and other small fittings subject to rope wear. Apart from laminated fabric articles, we examined many of resin-bonded laminated paper and of vulcanized fibre. In the laminated paper range were sheet materials with a black or coloured face and a white or trans parent under surface. By cutting through the former with an engraving machine, white or transparent lettering is produced for name plates on instru ment panels, the clearness of the letter ing being as permanent as the material.

Mould Lof An Important Stage in Boatbuilding THE importance of the mould loft to any boatbuilding concern, how ever small, cannot possibly be over emphasized. It is undoubtedly the real foundation of workmanship in the actual construction of a boat, and its intelligent use can save many pounds in time and material—a point of the utmost moment to the small firm. Most concerns of this type all too often regard work in the mould loft as something to be got over as quickly as possible, and with as little effort as is needed to enable them to put only the lines of the ship upon the floor. It is quite true that up to a certain point, nearly every builder realizes the importance of the loft, but very few of them are aware of the full significance of the time and money-saving poten tialities beyond this point. The foregoing remarks are not intended so much for the successful boatbuilder; he is already aware that intelligent use of the mould loft plays a big part in his success, but more for the amateur and the builder who have perhaps not given these matters all the attention they merit. Many yachts men, I have no doubt, will be seriously considering building a boat for them selves after the war. It is to the ulti mate benefit of the trade that as many boats as possible go afloat, from what source is no matter, and we therefore wish them every success with their efforts. I would, however, like to point out that the old adage ' start the job right and you'll finish it right' is perhaps more apt when applied to boatbuilding than to any other work. The mould loft is the very foundation from which the boat is built, and that is why I say its importance cannot be over stressed. When only the lines are put upon the floor it certainly gives an oppor tunity for fairing the designer's offsets, and for making templates for the full- size body moulds and centre line main frame; but that is as far as it goes, and it only touches the fringe of the information that can be obtained by intelligent application. Now let us try and see what are the main reasons for drawing a boat full- size upon the floor. First, of course, to fair the designer's offsets. Any small error on the part of the designer in lifting the offsets from the drawing is magnified many times when the design is reproduced full-size upon the floor. What was merely the thickness of a pencil point now becomes a sizable bump, and it By H. Rooke is a simple matter to put this right. Every line on the drawing means something, be it water line, buttock, bow line, or diagonal, and by letting go or pulling in wherever necessary the lines can be made to coincide as the designer intended. In this connec tion the diagonals become of great importance, and it is only here on the floor that one gets the full import of their usefulness. When every line is correct and properly drawn the hull can be considered fair. Planned Construction Whilst this is taking place the builder has an opportunity to ' size- up ' the job and to become familiar with all the characteristics of the hull. As the main frame is drawn, he is able to see details which allow him to plan for the correct series of operations which are to take place in the building berth. Intelligent planning of this type is always time well spent. The next important thing, and this is where many builders stop short, is to put down every essential detail of the framing construction full size. The centre main frame is first of all drawn in profile, and then by means of the bow lines and buttock lines such component parts as the stem, apron, fore deadwood, hog, stern post and horn timbers, etc., etc., are drawn in section. This sectioning enables the builder to see exactly what are his maximum sizes, and later, by means of a template, to pass on sufficient information for the timber merchant to supply timber to size. The template for the use of the timber merchant must have every bevel clearly shown—without them he can only supply the timber square- edged to the siding given, and this may entail cutting much larger than is strictly necessary, in which case, of course, the builder pays for the waste. However, with the bevels clearly marked, the timber merchant can use his judgment, and by a little juggling wherever the log falls away or has a defect, he can often get over it in an economical manner. The great thing is, of course, that the bevels show him the timber in its ultimate size and shape. It is most important that every mark should be lifted from the floor and transcribed on to the body moulds and templates. The datum line (that most important line of all), sheer heights, position of stringers and deck beam shelf, etc., if properly marked on the body moulds, can • alone save many pounds in the setting up of the vessel, although it is only a matter of a few minutes to make the transference from the floor. They should be scribed with a suitable sharp tool against the edge of a steel rule or straight-edge. This makes for greater accuracy and enables easier identification at a later stage, when handling and wear would have obscured other less permanent markings. Now comes the joinery work and the interior fittings. Very often, at first sight, some of the details on the plans may appear confusing, especially details of the interior; but when these have been drawn full size the confu sion disappears. Further, any mis takes in the full-size plan can be easily cleared up on the floor, although it is an expensive proposition to make alterations once the construction is well advanced. Interior Details Interior joinery work probably entails as much 'trying and fitting' as any other part of the boat, and, obviously, any lessening of this is money saved. For instance, bulk heads can be made complete in the joiners' shop from templates off the floor, and fitted into place in a very short time. The practice of ' mocking up' and building bulkheads piece meal in the boat involves a very great waste of time, and no builder with any pretensions to efficiency would ever allow it. Frequently, unless the bulk head comes right on a frame or station, there is no section available precisely the shape required, but it is quite a simple matter to run one in anew in the desired position. The bulkhead can then be cut to a template, and a minimum amount of wood left on for final fittings. The same applies to all the other interior work. Painting, varnishing and polishing can be carried forward to where a final lick over will be all that is necessary. Such things as locks are far more easily fitted to the joinery in the joiners' shop than when in the boat. Anything done in this manner will help to ease that final confusion as the craft draws nearer to completion. A word of warning, however, to the practising boatbuilder! Mould loft work can be carried too far, and may then prove very expensive when only one boat is contemplated from a par ticular design.FLYERS DOWN IN MINEFIELD Rescue Launches Save 20 An R.A .F. high-speed launch plunged into a Channel minefield in heavy seas to reach the crews of two ' ditched ' Flying Fortresses and came off after two hours in the thick of mines with 19 rescued men, ' We were on patrol,' said Flying Officer Lock- wood, ' when we had a signal to proceed to a crashed airplane about 17 miles away in the middle of the minefield. We were on the spot within 40 minutes. The seas had thrown the Americans about, and the wind had torn their dinghies apart, but they were all right. We had got the ten of them on board when a Spitfire signalled that there were other dinghies some miles away, at a point still strewn with mines. We soon found the dinghies, taking four men out of one and five out of another.' 10 '44 FROM THE EVESl\G ST.tS'D.IRD ' The deTeloprnent anJ construction of tli R.A.F. highspeed Regfti Launches is anothe of the achievements c ■■ ■ 'i 'r * i BOAT COMPAHY LTD ieiljned Sutfj . - ■■ .v;- ' ' ' • v _ .gi THE BRITISH POWER &amp;o mtxuctot* of Scott-A * ; lii'f' ^ rhe M otor B oat and February, 1945. ; YACHTINGsp m Although it is a far cry, in ships and tactics, from the 'Singeing of the King of Spain's Beard' to running the Democratic Clippers over the small moustache of to-day s Tyrant No. 1, the Spirit of Drake remains as steadfast as ever.

The MOTOR BOAT and Yachting 55 Improving Post-war Suggested Modifications in Marine Motor Details By 'Scallywag LIKE everything else, we must expect marine motors to cost more after the war than before, and nobody- can wish to see prices raised still further by additional fittings and refinements with which one could dis pense. On the other hand, while the general design and all-round perform ance of petrol and paraffin marine motors of reputable make is unques tionably satisfactory, there is room for improvement in much of the detail work. Starting with the electric ignition system, which is always the most vul nerable and delicate portion of a small marine power unit, experience shows that where a set of high-tension leads is supported in a tube above the cylin der heads, this should not be of metal, but rubber, fibre or plastic, so that perished or salt-laden insulation shall not inevitably result in a short circuit. If the magneto could be mounted vertically, and with the contact- breaker on top it would vastly improve the latter's accessibility; but it is realized that a skew drive would be necessary, and this, of course, is not a low-priced item. Still, the magneto could be mounted high, and the con tact-breaker cover could be held on by a stainless-steel spring, instead of the usual blued spring, which rusts, and in many cases breaks sooner or later. Another point calling for rectifica tion is the mounting of the sparking plugs. Too often the threaded hole in the cylinder head lies in a depression, the object of this arrangement being to bring the plug points well down into the combustion space. Unfortunately, flakes of rust and paint, sometimes water as well, collect in this depres sion, and fall into the cylinder on the plug's removal. It would be better to eliminate this, depression, even if it involves the use of long-reach plugs. A Gland That Leaks An auxiliary mechanism liable to need attention from time to time is the circulating pump; most frequently it is a gland leakage that must be seen to. The frequency of this trouble is usually due to insufficient packing space; moreover, on gear and drum pumps it is quite common for the spindle to be too short for one to run back the gland nut and insert pack ing without dismounting the pump. If there is one type of spare more neces sary than another it is a supply of greased gland packing rings. Caulk ing cotton and the like are most unsatisfactory as packing. Water, particularly salt water, is at the root of most marine motor troubles, and much more could be done to prevent it causing rust. Studs securing the exhaust manifold, bolts connecting water pipe flanges, and all small screws, could without appreciable extra cost be of stainless steel. Cer tainly that metal should be used for drain plugs. What Make ? A frequent cause of much trouble in engines of some age is the loss of the maker's number-plate. Surely such details as the serial number and identification letters, the power, r.p.m. and lubricant viscosity figure could be engraved on the cylinder block or on a crankcase door? The usual thin brass plates are very readily knocked off and lost. On some small engines—mostly two- strokes—the flywheel is held on the crankshaft by a large nut. Not infre quently this nut has a left-handed thread, but there is nothing to indicate the fact. As a consequence, anyone trying to remove this nut is liable to strain and strain at it, unwittingly screwing it up, till great force alone will remove it. An arrow stamped on this nut would save all risk of a strained crankshaft. A crankcase dipstick is such a simple implement that there appears no chance of mistake in its design, but this is not so. When a boat is rolling it is difficult to withdraw the stick without scraping it in its hole, making a smeared oil mark so that one cannot gauge the lubricant level. A series of shallow recesses should be drilled into the rod's stem to hold the oil. No smearing then would make any dif ference. For Shaft Alignment When lining up an engine on its bearers it is quite common to find that only when it has been coupled to the propeller shaft and turned by hand can one tell if the lining up is correct. This is a slow and inexact process that would be avoided had the makers planed up a flange, such as that along the bottom of the cylinder block, parallel with the crankshaft. With this, a level, and a straight edge, lining up would be exact, and therefore a great saving of the bearing surfaces. Between the adjustment of a marine motor and one in a car there is the difference, always to be remembered by a designer, that the former can in a great many instances only be got at from above, and not from the fly wheel end nor from the sides. A car buretter tucked right away under an exhaust manifold may constitute ' clean ' design, but the hands of the operator will not be in that condition when, guided by feel alone, he has . striven to adjust it. Apart from the various details so far mentioned, an all-round improve ment could not fail to result if for any given cylinder capacity the auxiliary fittings in general were of more gener ous size, thus allowing for any drop in their efficiency due to wear, corro sion, etc., and making them easier to adjust under the adverse conditions inevitable in small craft. As regards bolts, studs and screws, not only should these be of stainless steel, but as far as possible they should be of uniform size so that there is no search ing for the right size of spanner or spare nut in moments of emergency. Few engine designers appear fully to realize the cramped, dark recesses in which many small motors have to be installed, where adjustments have to be made largely by touch rather than sight. One even finds components painted black, as if it were desired to make matters worse. They should be white, and where possible stove- enamelled, to resist oil and heat inde finitely. Publicity To say that all American catalogues, instruction manuals and other printed matter issued by marine-engine manu facturers are better than their British counterparts, would be far too sweep ing, but on the average they are more informative. Telling the prospective purchaser that all materials and work manship are of the best carries but little weight with this type of product. There are catalogues in which it is difficult to ferret out the bore and stroke of an engine, and others that leave the most suitable propeller dia meter as a profound mystery. A point rarely touched on is the maximum tilt of the crankshaft an engine will stand, and whether the carburetter float chamber can be levelled up at that angle. » In all probability the most generally fruitful cause of chronic inefficiency in a reputable make of engine is poor installation work, for which the manu facturers are most unfairly blamed; but it is up to them to help boatbuilders with installation diagrams.56 The Motor Boat and Yachting February, 1945. Above The Unfrequented Headwaters of the Thames By H. G. M. Osborne W7ITH the many hundreds of motor W craft stationed on the Thames it is surprising how few of them are to be seen on the 30-odd miles of river above Oxford.

It is a pleasant spot with an inn at each end of the bridge, 'The May Bush' on the Berkshire side and 'The Rose Revived' on the Oxfordshire bank. The River Windrush joins the main stream just above the bridge, but it is not navigable for any considerable distance. The 'Ten-foot' Bridge, a narrow wooden structure, typical of several to be found on these upper reaches, is some miles farther up stream; like the others, it marks the site of an old weir. A mile or so above Tadpole Bridge, Rushey Lock is reached.

She measures 21 it. L.W.L., beam 6 ft. 8 ins., draught 2 ft. 6 ins., cabin head room 4 ft.. 8 ins., no ballast, cockpit 5 ft. 11 ins., engine 25 h.p., speed 11 knots. Can you tell me if this craft will be capable of cruising in coastal waters with an occasional dash across the Channel? Also, is it safe to use sails without danger of capsizing? Is it necessary to fix a heavy keel or ballast? I notice she rolls badly in the slightest wash. J.W. YOUR LAUNCH would not be suitable for coastal cruising, as she would be unsafe in the tide rips off headlands. On the other hand, with a small amount of ballast, and in view of her speed, she could cross the Straits of Dover in fine weather and be in port before the sea had time to get up. We would suggest fixing bar iron on both sides of the keel with through- bolts. The iron should be 10 ft. long, 3 ins. deep and 1 in. or 1^ ins. thick, with wood fairings about 2 ft. long at each end. With this ballast she should be able to carry a small sail area with the wind on the beam or aft.— E d. Trouble With Tar WE are having difficulty in painting over the black bitu minous paint with which the outside of a barge has been liberally plastered. Is there any preparation on the market which will prevent this bituminous paint from coming through and spoiling other paintwork? W.A. MUCH DEPENDS on the nature of the bitumastic paint which has been used. If it is black varnish, it may be pos sible to cover this successfully, but if it is tar there is always the chance of it coming through in hot weather. We should advise you to test a small area in the following way; — Scrape down the black paint as far as possible with a stiff wire brush, and then coat it with metallic paint, of which the easiest to obtain is aluminium, sometimes known as ' gal vanizing paint.' Over this, when thoroughly dry, it should be possible to apply ordinary outdoor paint, as the black is very unlikely to come through the metal unless the former melts with heat.-— E d.

(2c) The mast should not be less than 10 ft. high.— E d. An Unsinkable Dinghy HAT buoyancy tanks should I put into a National dinghy ? THE RULE is:—Not less than three tanks must be fitted so that the buoyancy of the boat, full of water, exceeds her weight by 200 lb.; 50 lb. of buoyancy must act within 5 ft, of the stem and 150 lb. abaft of amidships.— E d. , An Engine for a Runabout MAY I ask your advice on the installation of a suitable unit in my Rytecraft, mahogany carvel-built hull? I have had so much trouble using large outboard motors that I want to fit an inboard engine that will give me at least an equal speed. One outboard motor used to give about 30 m.p.h.—another slightly less, and I have in mind using a Ford V8 30 h.p. engine. Would this be suitable driving direct to the propeller'? The hull length is 16 ft. 2 ins., beam 4 ft. 6 ins., depth 20 ins. and weight 308 lb.,.and I would never want to carry more than three people. My boatbuilder will do the necessary fitting, subject to my getting the unit ready for him to install. Should the V8 be unsuitable, perhaps you could advise another engine. J.G. WE CONSIDER that the 30 h.p. Ford V8 would be too heavy for your craft, and that she would be more satisfactorily powered with the 22 h.p. V8 model. This has a peak output, which should prove ample.— E d. An Exposed Propeller IT is proposed to install a 12 h.p. Diesel engine in a wooden canal barge 70 ft. by 7 ft. This barge has no counter, and the propeller would be about two-thirds submerged when the barge was empty. The draught then would be about 12 ins. at the stern and 6 ins. at the bow. Could you tell me what would be the effect of not completely submerging the propeller ? Also, I thought of fixing an iron guard round the propeller in line with the boss to prevent damage. Would this have any detrimental effect ? My reason for not using an orthodox motor canal barge is that, owing to the deep, empty draught of the motor barge and the shallowness of the canal (in places \ it is not more than 36 ins. deep), it is not possible to get a paying load on a motor barge. J.W.M. WHILE THE propeller tips are exposed the propeller, if left-handed, will have a tendency to swing the stern to port, and vice versa. A plate located over the propeller would help to keep the water down on to the blades. No guard is effective unless it is a complete funnel-shaped cage, enclosing the propeller.— E d. Constructional Details | AM thinking of buying a 17-ft. sailing boat, and an answer '&gt; the following questions would greatly oblige:—(1) It is zilt of Scotch larch. Is this satisfactory for salt and fresh water? (2) It is fastened with brass screws and not riveted. Will this be satisfactory? (3) There has been a small quantity of cement run into the bottom. As the boat is not very old I questioned the reason, and was informed it was for ballast. Will this cause the bottom to rot? ' R.L. IN ANSWER to your numbered queries. (1) Good quality Scotch larch is a first-class boat timber, and we should expect it to stand fresh water fairly well, although it is best in salt. (2) Brass screws are not so reliable as copper rivets, but will last if not bent by severe strains. (3) The cement will not cause rot, but will keep the wood wet and somewhat soft.— E d. An Unsuitable Propeller • PLEASE advise as to the most suitable propeller size for an R.N.L.I. conversion just purchased, details as follow:— Length 35 ft., beam 9 ft., draught 2 ft. (3 ins. approximately; engine. Ford 'A ' model fitted to starboard of the sternpost. The present propeller is marked 14 by 16JL. It races when the throttle is opened up. G.B. YOUR ENGINE should give 24 h.p. at 1,500 r.p.m., and it calls for a three-bladed propeller of 14i ins. diameter and 10 ins. pitch. The excessive pitch was the cause of the trouble you have experienced.— E d. WTO LOOK AT! tJwflL / Clean oil is lovely to look at. 1 y If / Smooth and clear and shining— ■/ w y S like liquid gold!' It doesn 't stay clean long! Pretty soon it's developing excess acid; collecting carbon, sludge, and grit. And what that dirty oil does' to your engine is nobody's business! Until you get the bills for repairs, and re-bores and renewals. Then it's our business. It's your business to protect good oil so that it can protect your engine. You can half do the job by fitting strainers to trap the worst of the dirt. Or you can do the job properly by fitting all your vehicles with Fram Oil Cleaners. In which case the oil will start clean and stay clean — all the time. (All three Services use Fram, of course). FRAM STRAINS all the ' big 1 dirt' from the oil. COLLECTS the tiny carbon particles until they too can be strained out. PREVENTS sludge formation. CHECKS acid corrosion.

F( )K Bombay ) BAruiEIK ) Regulations for the Receipt and Examination of Stores in India. 1. Each package should be inspected at the port of landing, and, if any be received from the vessel in a defective state, or appear to be tampered with, they should be immediately opened, due notice having first been given to the Master to attend, or to depute some person to do so on his behalf, in order that the amount of any damage for which the vessel is liable may be recovered from the Owner. Whenever practicable such recovery should be made in India at the current official rate of exchange, and a note showing amount recovered inserted on this Packing Account. 2. The stores are to be examined immediately on receipt at their destination, in the presence of a responsible officer. A report on the Stores is to be given as indicated under 'B' on the third page of this Packing Account. 3. All articles not enclosed in packages are held to have been counted or weighed by the Master of the vessel, on shipment, and consequently any loss is chargeable to the Owner of the vessel. 4. Should any articles appear to have original defects, samples, upon which a judgment may be formed, should in all cases be sent home with the complaint, whether it relate to quality or to pattern. 6. If Stores be received broken or damaged in consequence of defective packing, the method of packing and the respect in which it was defective should be stated, as the absence of such particulars may render it impossible to substantiate a claim against the suppliers. If cloths are short in measure, the lead seal stamped on the piece should be returned with the Packing Account. 6. Condemned Stores are not to be disposed of locally at a loss to (.Tovernmeiu, until a reference has b; en made to the Government of India, unless the Stores are of such a perishable nature as to render it desirable to dispose of them at once to prevent further loss. 7. If any article, not herein described, be received, full particulars thereof shall be entered in the Packing Account. If it belong to another Station, intimation should immediately be sent to such Station. Note.—Where shortage or damage occurs, for which a claim should be made against suppliers for replacement, repair, or recovery of value, full particulars should be sent at once by letter to the Director-General, India Store Department, Blackpool, Shortages will not be made good, or damaged articles replaced, unless this is requested. political Agent, ^ahrrin, .

One Ahmad bin •Salman bin Ma tar of Muharraq has a good launch the specifications of which are as' fol' 1 ows:- Length of beam - J? 1 B'. Draught - 4-' . Width - l? f Engine • - 50 horse power - Kelvin The owner of this launch says he has not yet decided to sell but will let us know by to-day of his final decision through Mubarak, the broker. The launch is now at Halat Bu Mahir at Muharraq. May I go and see it and also find out what tackles it has. r *), 5.44 P.A. I went to Muharraq yesterday and saw this launch, % oy It Is a very good launch and^in perfect condition. I could not see the engine as the entrance to it was nailed. The deck of the launch was dirty but it can be cleaned very easily. On arrival there, I saw Gray, Mackenzie's Agent and his assistant examining this launch and another jollyboat which they wished to buy. Later I went and met Ahmad bin Salman bin Matar, the owner of the launch. He said he had no intention of selling his launch as he wants to use it for going out to the pearl banks and that he might sell it after the pearl season Is over,I.e., after 6 months hence &gt; but as stir ed me that should he change his mind and decide to sell It, he will let us know. As far as I know there Is no other launch with a. 60 h.p. engine for sale locally. There are small launches with 25 h.p. engines but used much and may not be reliable. Mubarak, the broker Is endeavouring to find a suitable launch. U. r Hajl Jaslm Taltun says that the approximate cost of building a dhow according to Bushlre specifications would h* Rsl5,000 (fifteen thousand). Mubarak, the broker, says that there Is a secondhand Jollyboat for sale. Its length Is 51*, beam 16 ! , draught 4*. It has complete tackles. Hafl Jaslm says ltt| good dhow but requires alterations to €he bottom if It is desired to turn it Into a launch. It belongs to a man of Muharraq P.T.O. fyi&amp; The envelope herewith contains papers and drawings I have made of designs for the Bandar Abbas launch hull at present beached outside the Agency garden. It was exceedingly difficult to get the correct measurements of the hull working by myself and I cannot pretend that the drawings are more than approximate, but the P .R. (Colonel Galloway) to whom I showed these sketches agreed to them in principle. 2. If the plans are put into execution, some or all of the following modifications will probably have to be made. (i) The single cabin may have to be given up to be made into a combined lavatory and bath-room because the lavatory in the forecastle has, in the present plan, too little head-room. It would seem a pity to abolish the cabin because one will almost certainly be needed for a clerk or wireless operator - but I cannot say what else can be done. (ii) It may be necessary to raise ; ^or better) to lower the roof of the saloon. That has to be worked out in relation to the floor of the saloon. 3. It should be noted that the bridge above the portion shown hatched with lines is not enclosed - only covered with a^K . This is perhaps unusual, but I cannot 'US ■ that the huge glass enclosures usually mounted on Gulf launches are at all necessary. 4. Place this envelope with the file concerning the launch. When is the engine due? Has a reminder been sent about it? j A.P.A . Kf-* 5 9.9.1945.
