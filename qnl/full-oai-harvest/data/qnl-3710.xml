The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard William Craven Fowle; the Political Agent in Bahrain, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch; and the Assistant Political Agent in Bahrain, Meredith Worth.The file’s telegrams and file notes detail the reluctance of British officials to permit Harding to land in Bahrain, a British national who they mistakenly assumed to be American, fearing that he may be investigating the possibility of opening a branch of his bank on the islands.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>American Express Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Visas</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000335#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000335#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
