At 10 a.m. we went . long to the Palace, where there was a guard of honour. The Sultan and the Resident sat behind a red covered table at the end of the room f with the K.F.A. behind and to the left of the Sultan and myself behind atdto the right of the Resident. Llusc:.tm officials and notables sat darn the wall to the left, and the British party, consisting of SN0PG-, HMVO, the jL'O, and tliree other Naval ofiicers. opposite to them. The proceedings were brief. The Resident handed to the Sultan the document appointing him MBM*s plenipotentiary (the Sultan kept it but has promised to return it). The Sultan then made a speech in arabic, a rough translation of which had already been made in the Consulate so that amzasaoibOBS the PR, SN0PG- and myself had co ies with Wuich to follow. The Resiuent, who hml alreauy supplied trie Sultan with his speech with an Arabic trans- - 1 . tion, replied and a translation of his words were re^d out by the Wali of Hat rah. The treaties were t’nen signed, and the Sultan and the Resident exchanged pens (apparently an old Muscat! custom!). Ooffee, halwa (in vaste vats), rosewater (poured in profusion from veeels like English coffee pots, to be avoided if one is ’uanclling treaties at the same time) and incense completed the proceedings, except for photographs in the corridor.

LqiU -att ha ihaxd; cm ^ Jr n/n/si . -H c PT7 ,SPEECH 1 Your Highness and Gentlemen. I regard it as a great honour and privilege that I have 'been authorised by my august Sovereign His Majesty King George VI to act on his behalf on this memorable occasion. As Your Highness has pointed out it is now over 150 years since the first treaty was signed between Muscat and Great Britain and throughout this long period the happiest relations have always existed between the two countries. This new Treaty like its predecessors is the result and not the cause of these happy relations. It introduces no new features of importance but serves bring up to date and define more clearly understandings which have been reached between the two governments on the basis of their long friendship. I thank Your Highness very much indeed for the kind references you have made to myself. I have known Your Highness since your visit to Delhi in 1938 and recall with the greatest pleasure the days I have spent with Your Highness in Muscat and Dhofar and the many long talks I have had with you. I have always greatly valued Your Highness* personal friendship and unfailing courtesy. It is indeed a matter of regret that Major Chauncy is not v/ith us to-day in order to be present at the culmination of his long and arduous labours. I know Your Highness will agree that both parties to the Treaty owe a great deal to the meticulous care which he has given to all the issues involved. He has asked me to express his regard for Your Highness and to say how sorry he is that he cannot be with us to-day. He hopes that the Treaty will bear fruit ful results and is sensible of the privilege which the part he has played in its making has conferred upon him. Mr. Gethin has carried on where he left off and his ability and clarity of mind have contributed substantially to the successful outcome of the negotiations. I feel however that in spite of all our efforts little could have been achieved /hadhad not Your Highness been so patient and reasonable in all the long discussions we have had with you. We all pray to God that this Treaty will serve to strengthen the happy relations which have existed for so long between the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and the British Government and that these relations will continue without abatement or interruption not only for the fifteen years for which the Treaty is due to run but for many generations to come. In conclusion on behalf of the Government of His Majesty King George VI, of myself and of all those present, I pray for Your Highness* long life, har&gt;piness and success and for the prosperity and progress of Your Highness* Sultanate.(EA 1053/154) POREION OFFICE, S.W.1 14th December, 1951 RESTRICTED As you will gather, the two copies of the new Anglo- Muscat Treaty enclosed in our despatch No. 194 of the 14 th December, have been prepared in such a way that when you proceed to signature it remains only for impressions of your own and the Sultan* s personal seals to be affixed in wax against the respective signatures below each text. 2.

Sufficient wax is enclosed for the purpose. 3* Your own signature should be appended on the left and the Sultan’s on the right under each text in both British and Arabic copies.

INTEL 12th December, 1951 RESTRICTED TREATY WITH THE SULTAN OF MUSCAT The Sultan of Muscat gave notice in February last year (as under the terms of the treaty he was entitled to do) of his wish to terminate the 1939 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with the United Kingdom and India. Although he gave no specific reason for his action, it was understood that he considered some of the articles, in which he undertook obligations without reciprocity, to be out of date, and that he wished to withdraw or reduce the extra-territorial privileges which British subjects have enjoyed in Muscat over the past hundred years. 2. Negotiations for a new treaty, which have been in progress over the last few months, have now been completed, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is due to go to Muscat later this month for the signature of the new treaty with the Sultan. It will be signed only on behalf of the United Kingdom and there will be no provision, as there was in the 1939 Treaty, for the accession of Common wealth countries. It will, however, be provided that the treaty may be extended to any territories for the international relations of which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom is responsible. 3. The new treaty, which is the first commercial treaty proper to be concluded by the United Kingdom since the war, is, like the one it is to replace, shorter and less elaborate than most of our pre-war commercial treaties, or our present drafts for treaties with more important countries. It is to remain in force for fifteen years from the date of ratification. In general it provides for reciprocal, national and most-favoured-nation treatment of commerce and shipping (with the exception of the coasting trade) and in respect of taxation. As a result of the negotiations we shall retain extra-territorial jurisdiction over citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, other than Moslems, and, with certain reservations, over nationals of other countries of the Commonwealth. The arrangements relating to jurisdiction are, however, being dealt with by an exchange of letters, and not, as in 1939, in the text of the treaty. 15160—741 41540—7 [4. The4. The treaty probably has greater value politically than commercially, since. there is at present comparatively little trade between the United Kingdom and Muscat, and the new treaty provides the formal expression of our close and traditional friendship with the Sultan, who is an independent sovereign. We have had Treaties of Friendship and Commerce with the Sultans of Muscat continuously since 1839, and our connexions with the Sultanate extend back to the end of the 18th century. In any publicity given to the conclusion of this treaty after its signature is announced it should be emphasised that we welcome this strengthening of our bonds with a country with which we have for long had close relations. 5. You may make full use of all the above with the exception of paragraph 1 as soon as the treaty is signed.

Communique begins: A new treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation was signed at Muscat on February 5th in respect of United Kingdom and Indio, represented by Sir Tronchard F&amp;wle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Sultan of Muscat replacing treaty of 1891 which expires on February 11th, 1939 and reaffirming close ties which have existed between His Majesty’s Government and Sultanate of Muscat nearly a century and a half and it will oe remembered that recently the Sultan paid officialX COPY Your Highness and Gentlemen, Your Highness has given an interesting resum^ of the relations between your country and Great Britain for the last century and a half. It is therefore unnecessary for me to dilate on this association any further, I should however like to endorse most heartily what Your Highness has expressed so eloquently of the happy relations which have existed over this long period. As Your Highness has pointed out, the Treaty which we are about to sign is no new departure in these relational but merely a further step in cementing the ties of friendship and interests which bind our two countries. Your Highness has mentioned your visit to England last year, and the happy recollections you have retained of it, I was present in London at that time, and I feel that I can assure Youg Highness that all whom you met, both officials and others, preserve the same happy recollections, and that when Your Highness left England you left many friends behind you. With regard to the kind expressions that Your Highness has used concerning that part of the negotiations played by Major UVatts and myself, I thank you most sincerely. I cannot let these words pass without expressing my gratitude for the spirit of cooperation and friendliness displayed by Your Highness which helped so greatly the negotiations which have reached their happy conclusions today. But it was not in these negotiations that relations between Your Highness and myself began. I was Consul accredited to the Sultanate when Your Highness came to the throne 7 years ago and both in that capacity and as Political Resident our relations both official / andand personal have been of the happiest nature. I have watched with the greatest pleasure and interest the progress of the Sultanate under Your Highness’s rule. In conclusion, on behalf of iny Government and myself and all those present, I wish Your Highness long life and happiness and a future full of prosperity for your Sultanate.Cypher ' Code Clear Hear F rom :— Rahrai n.

In that case he wishes Arabic text of preamble to mention the plenipotentiaries of The King and .the Sultan in that order as in 1939 treaty and in English text; and a similar change at the end after M in witness thereof’'. Sultan pointed out,Arabic text was a translation and should follow the English; I imagine this is not strictly true but for me to have demurred would probably have resulted in his rewriting of Arabic text. ‘ 7 * immediately following telegram to Foreign Office repeated to you saving gives- verbal changes he has, requested. 1939 repeat 1939 after a phrase indicates 'as in 1939 treaty'. 3.

They agree to the automatic termination of the provisional application of the agreement in the event of non-ratification but suggest that instead of a period of four months and then an additional month, there should be a single period of five months, so that Article 16(3) would read; If five months after the date of signature the instruments of ratification have not been exchanged the provisional application of this treaty shall then cease. If this is acceptable to Tour Highness,perhaps Your Highness would be good enough to let me know today and I can telegraph London - if however there is the least difficulty, it can be discussed when I next have the honour of being received by Tour Highness.

It was of course prepared before the most recent changes in the English text were agreed on, and they have not yet been made in the Arabic. It is hoped to have bound copies of the treaty completed and ready for signature by 13th recember, on which date . they will be sent by air to the Resident who expects to arrive here on the 19th. 'e have therefore very little time.

I hope that in any case he will not raise any objection on account of language or style and that he will concentrate on mistranslations or ambiguities if there are any. If he wishes to make a large number of alterations it will, I think, be impossible to get the Treaty through before the end of the year. 2. With regard to amendments, something appears to have gone wrong with the third sentence of paragraph 2 of Rose f s letter. The second part of the sentence should, perhaps, read ”what Arabic texts of amendments will be required as a result of changes in the English’'. It will be ^ impossible for a reply to this letter to reach me by bag until the pth December and even then the reply may arrive too late for inclusion in the Foreign Office bag which leaves on the morning of the 6 th December. I hope therefore it will be possible for you to persuade the Sultan to trust us to make reasonaoly accurate translations of any changes in the English text either here or at the Foreign Office. 3 . Would you kindly let me have a telegraphic reply to this letter stating (a) whether the Sultan is ready to accept the Arabic trans lation as it stands subject to amendments on account of changes in the English, and (b) whether he is willing to trust us to make accurate translations of any amendments. With regard to (a), if the Sultan only requires a few alterations please telegrap h th&lt;=&gt;m Wn J.A.F.

The page marked A contains the version of Article 16 which was proposed in paragraph 3 of our telegram No. 598 of the 6th November with the periods in clause 3 of this Article . amended as agreed in paragraph k of our telegram No. 608. The page marked B contains our original text of Article 16. In the top copy we have given only the text of the new Article 16 set out in our telegram No. 598. 2. There will be certain further alterations to this text consequent on the Sultan’s requests reported in Muscat telegram Ho* 210 of the 12th November to you and any further changes which may be necessary. Since however final decisions have not yet been given on these further amendments we hope it will be possible for changes in the Arabic text to be made locally as soon as final agreement is reached on the English draft. Would you very kindly let us know whether the Sultan accepts this translation and whether Arabic texts of any amendments may be required as a result of changes in the English? 7/e should like to have this information as near as possible to the beginning of December so as to give us time to have the Arabic and English texts printed and bound together and sent out to you by about the middle of December. 3. We find It difficult to give a definite reply to the enquiry in your letter No. 10M/164 of the 14th November to Garell about the date which you are likely to receive the papers. If all goes well and the final English text is able to be settled by about the middle of next week it should be possible to get the bound signature copies of the Treaty in the bag leaving on the 15th December. This, however, can only be a tentative date since a number of ooints are still outstanding, including the question of ratification. I do not think however that it would be possible to have everything ready in time for the bag on the previous Saturday and we should therefore make the 15th December our aim. (C.M.

PERSIAN GULF.(8A 1053/109) HBSTRXCT!’!P ^OR^iaH OFFICE, S*W.1• 8th November, 1951 Iv'o have dtycuseefi with the T&gt;epartment8 concerned the procedure for the signature of the Muscat Treaty which waa dealt with in your letter No. 1041/29 the 22nd October. 2. We agree that it will be necessary to have both English and Arabic versions ofthe text available at the time of signature and that both should be signed ctm Itaneously. The si matures should be one above the other and not opposite one another as in the 1939 Treaty. You should sign the English text first end the Sultan the Arabic. On the last occasion, in 1939, the torts were printed here and two sets for signature were sent out to Bahrain, each air ady bound with the blue silk ribbon. Thus it only remained or the ends of the ribbon to be fixed to the end of texts (one to the Sn^lish and one to the Arabic side) by means of a wax seal ag inst each signatory’s name. The signature pages of the English and Arabic texts, when bound together, will face one another in the centre of the document and the ribbons will therefore emerge in the same place. Your own signet ring bearing the family erect is entirely appropriate for the seal, which should be impressed in wex to the left of your rifTnature. There is no special pen for use for this purpose, and we suggest that you should purchase one in the bazaar which can be given to the Sultan after the signature of the Treaty. 3. Full towers are being prepared here under which you will be authorised to sign as His Majesty* s Plenipotentiary and these will be sent in time for you to take them to Muscat to show to the Sultan. In 1939 the signature took place on the 5th February, and ratifications are shown in the printed copy of the Treaty as having been exchanged on the 7th February. You will have seen our telegram '0.597 of6th November, 1951 , on the subject of ratification, and we hope that the Sultan will be willing to agree to M provieional application.' If not, we shall probably have to ask for exemption from the Parliamentary requirement, but even if this is approved it may be difficult to get through the procedure in time. 4. «e hope that we shall he able to get the signature copies of the Treaty out to you in time for you to go to Muscat in the middle of December. There is a good deal to be done, however, at this end, and we should therefore be glad to be informed by telegram of the progress of negotiations and in particular of any likely alterations which may be needed in the text. +1 (R.F.O. Sarell) Lieutenant Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.T.E., C.S.I., Bahrain.(KA 1053A15) H STRICxj;]) . . . 10th Hovember 1931• Thank you for your letter Ifo* IOm. 1/133 of the 23 th October, with v^hich you enclosed copies of the 1938 correspondence about corporate bodies end British vessels ♦ These are substantially the same as they stand now, but require some small amendtonts in order to coni r 1 to the chan ed provisions of the roaty. 2. Thus from the note by the Board of Trade on 'corporate bodies*' the words after ‘'United Kingdom law*' at the end of the third sentence should be omitted, anc3 we suggest that the words :f in relation to Southern Rhodesia (provided that the Treaty has been extended to Southern Rhodesia under Article 13) to cosrqpanies registered under Southern Rhodesian law* should be substituted. In the letter from V.alton of the 22nd April, 193^* the words ’apply to' would now be more apr^ropriate than the words 'limit the jurisdiction of Your Highness over 1 ’ in Paragraph (a). 3 . The note about British vessels does require some modification because of the restriction in the scope of the definition of this term in Article 1. It might be explained to the Sultan that while the note is still in principle correct, and it remains true that a uscat national could not s-cure registration of his ship as a 'British' ship, the note would have to be amended if it is to be reed in relation to the new definition. If the Sultan requires a new note the following should be substituted for the second sentence of the present note:- 'The law regarding registration of v seels is uniform throughout the United Kingdom and the territories to which the Treaty may be extended under Article 13 in requiring that a ship may not be registered at a port in any of these territories unless owned wholly by British subjects or by bodies corporate established under and subject to the laws of some part of His Majesty’s dominions, and having their principal place of business in those detain ons; thus there is no possibility that a Muscat national might secure registration of his ship at a port in the United Kingdom or in any territory to which the Treaty ney be extended under Article 13.'

Although the Sultan has already produced a draft letter which he is prepared to sign, giving his interpretation of the term 'Consuls' in Article II of the Treaty, we consider that mention of Consuls-General and Consular Agents should be uade, as well as Acting and 'ice-Consuls.

As regards the amended Article 16 (see F.0, telno 598 to you). Sultan thought para: three 'wuld not look nice' as a permanent feature in the treaty. He suggested an exchange of letters stating that the provisions of the new Treaty would be applied from 1st January 1952 until treaty was ratified or for three months whichever was shorter.

It is the normal practice to lay treaties before Parliament after signature for 21 sitting days before ratification. Exemption from this requirement was obtained in 1939 as a special case and instrument of ratification was therefore signed by the King only two days after signature of treaty. 2. We should prefer to avoid seeking authority to depart from normal practice in this case, particul arly as this is first commercial treaty to be negotiated since war. It might in any case be difficult to complete necessary formalities in time for ratification before 31st December because of Christmas holidays. Unless you see any objection- 2 - please explain to Sultan delay occassioned by Parliamentary idleness (this year Parliament reassembled 23 rd January) and suggest t iat in ordei to avoid a hiatus he should agree to ^provisional application of treaty from 1 st January pending exchange of ratifications. 3 . In order to provide for this we propose that following should be substituted for present Article 16 of the draft treaty: ” 1 . The present treaty shall be subject to ratification and instruments of ratification shall be exchanged at Muscat as soon as possible 2. The present treaty shall enter into force provisionally on 1st January 1952 and definitively on exchange of instruments of ratification. 3. If instruments of ratification are not exchanged within six months from date of signatur either High Contracting Party may terminate the provisional application of this treaty by giving three months notice in writing to the other High Contracting Party. 4. We are arranging translation, the other points you raised will be dealt with by letter. V' 32 - S. 0. S. P.

Sir, I enclose a new draft of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation which is being negotiated with the Sultan of Muscat, to replace the draft sent to you under ^ cover of Mr. Morrisons despatch No. 110 (SA 1053/11) of ' 24th July. This draft incorporates all amendments up to and including those given in Mr. Rose^ letter No. EA 1053/94^^ of 23rd October. 2. In addition to those of which Your ijccellency has already been notified, a few minor drafting amendments have been made in the text. For example the words f, ( hereinafter referred to as ’'the United Kingdom')' have been added after 'Northern Ireland' in paragraph (1) of Article 1, and the word 'Sultan’s' has been substituted for 'Omani' at the end of paragraph (3) so as to be consistent with paragraph ( 4 ). t 3* The final texts of a number of Articles still await tne outcome of further discussion with the Sultan. Details of the points to be settled in Articles 1, 3 12 and 15 were given in Mr. Rose’s letter of 23rd October (as amended), and of the point in Article 11 in Mr. Sarell’s letter No. EA 1053/96 of 22nd October. 4* There is one further point which I consider it necessary to cover, which arises in connexion with taxation in consequence of the conversion of Article 3 (2) of the 1939 Treaty into a reciprocal form. This point relates to the benefits which are available in the United Kingdom to the nationals of certain countries by virtue of double taxation agree:nents. These His Excellency, Lieutenant Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., Bahrain. /bilateralbilateral agreements between His Majesty’s Government and a number of governments provide means to prevent the taxation of the same income in two countries. The benefits of these agreements are naturally intended only for persons who have connexions with the countries concerned or who may have to pay the taxes of the countries concerned. It is possible that nationals of other countries with whom commercial treaties are made would not be able to claim any benefits of such double taxation agreements even if these benefits were not specifically excluded in the commercial treaties themselves. Nevertheless so as to ensure without doubt that a claim to these benefits based on the grant in the commercial treaties of most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of tax liabilities cannot succeed, it is the practice to make a specific reservation on the point. This is not likely to be a matter of practical significance to the 3ultan T s subjects, but in theory at least a subject of the Sultan could under the most - favoured-nation provisions of Article 3 claim the benefit of any double taxation agreement the United Kingdom may have with a third country in respect of any income he may derive from a territory of His Majesty (as defined in the Treaty). I propose therefore to record in a letter to the Sultan that I do not interpret any thing in the Treaty as permitting such claims. ^ 5* As indicated in Mr, Rose f s letter of 23rd October a proviso has also been added to the draft text of Article 3(2) to guard against the somewhat theoi'etical possibility that a national of the Sultan who is not residerio in a territory of His Majesty but derives income from such a territory might claim reliefs from taxation to which in such circumstances a British subject is entitled under the law of the territory. 6 . Although the possibility is remote that the cases dealt with in the proposed letter and in the proviso to Article 3(2) will arise under the Muscat Treaty, it is the normal practice of His Majesty’s Government to include such provisiohs in all modern /commercialcommercial treaties, and I hope that with this explanation the Sultan ill be prepared to accept them* You may also point out that the necessity for them arises from the grant of reciprocity in Article 3* 7* The substance of the proposed letter to the Sultan would be as follows M I am writing to place on record the understanding of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that nothing in the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the seas and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and dependencies signed at Muscat today shall be construed as granted to either High Contracting Party the right to claim the benefit of any term, preference or privilege, which may at any time be accorded in any territory of either High Contracting Party solely in virtue of a provision relating to double taxation contained in an agreement with any other country * 11 I do not consider it necessary to publish the letters containing this interpretation, although they would be available for production if required to support the rejection of any clains* 8 . I should be glad if you will report as soon as possible the results of the discussions on the outstanding points mentioned above* I am, with great truth and respect, Sir, Your Excellency’s obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State)Draft Treaty of F ri endenip, Cormier Navigation between His Majesty tne Cultan of Muscat ^nd Oman Muscat, ,1951 Hie Majesty The King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, ana Sultan Said bin Taimur bin Faisal, Sultan of Muscat and Omen and Dependencies, Desiring to confirm and strengthen the friendly relations which now subsist between them and to promote and extend their commercial relations by the conclusion of a new treaty to replace the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation signed at Muscat on the 5th February, 1939- Have accordingly appointed os their plenipotentiaries;- His Majesty The King of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the Seas (hereinafter referred to as His Majesty); For the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Lieutenant-Colonel, Sir vVilliam Rupert Hay, K.C.I.h.,C.C.I His Majesty’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; The Sultan of Muscat and Oman and Dependencies (hereinafter referred to as the Sultan), in person; V/ho have agreed os follows;- ARTICLE 1 .

Eastern Department, Foreign Office, S. .1COPY Article 1 (ii) of draft Treaty ('corporate bodies') Note by Board of Trade Definition of 'nationals' as including corporate bodies. Nowadays trade is of course carried on, at any rate in countries such as the United Kingdom with a highly developed economic structure, by companies at least as much as by individuals, and this will more particularly be true where international trade is concerned. In these circumstances it is necessary, and is now the invariable practice, for H.M. Government in their commercial treaties to stipulate for rights of companies as well as rights of individual subjects. For this purpose it is necessary to define the companies to which the treaty provisions are applicable, and this is regularly affected, both in United Kingdom treaties and in those concluded by other Powers, by defining them as those corporate bodies which are incorporated applies: thus, for example, in relation to the United Kingdom, the present definition will make the treaty applicable to companies registered under United Kingdom law, and in relation to India, to companies registered under the law of India. The term 'nationals' has been used in the present draft as a convenient expression to embrace both individual subjects and companies, but as the case of companies is naturally not always comparable with that of subjects, the draft definition specifies that the word 'nationals' shall include corporate bodies only in relation to certain Articles of the draft which are appropriate to companies as well as to individuals. r*Article 1 (ill) of draft Treaty (registration of shipping) Note by Board of Trade, As regards the definition of ’British vessels’ in paragraph (iii) of Article 1, this again is common form in treaties concluded by H.M. Government. The law regarding registration as a British ship is uniform throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations in requiring that a ship shall not be deemed to be a British ship unless owned wholly by persons of the following description, namely (a) natural-bom British subjects, (b) persons naturalised by or in pursuance of an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or by or in pursuance of an Act of ordinance of the proper legislative authority in a British possession, (c) bodies corporate established under and subject to the laws of, some part of His Majesty's dominions, and having their principal place of business in those dominions: thus, there is no possibility that (as the Sultan apprehends) a Muscat! might secure registration of his ship as a British ship, whether under the law of Australia or of any other /part of the iimpire.COPY INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.1. 22nd April, 1938. Your Highness, I understand that Your Highness desires to receive an explanation in writing of two points which you have raised in respect of the reference to “corporate 'bodies w in Article 1 (ii) of the revised provisional draft Treaty. I am accordingly directed by the Secretary of State to give Your Highness the following explanations: (a) The rights proposed to be granted to corporate bodies under the proposed draft are solely rights of the corporate bodies as such and would not in any way limit the jurisdiction of Your Highness over non-British employees of a corporate body as individuals. (b) In the event of a British Company obtaining a concession or contract wherein they accepted the imposition of conditions or restrictions by the Government of Your Highness the terms of the concession or contract would be upheld by His Majesty’s Consul even though the conditions or restrictions involved a surrender of rights which might otherwise have been claimed by the Company under the Treaty.Wt. 23623/396 10m. 9.50 Wa. &amp; Co.

S 44 ^/m BRITISH RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. PERSIAN GULF.(EA 1053/94) , FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.1. CONFIDENTIAL 23rd October, 1951. We had hoped to be able to send you a new draft of the Muscat Treaty incorporating all the amendments so far, but unfortunately it has not been possible to get this ready in time for to-day’s Bag, Since, however, the tine which remains is getting short, I think it will be useful if I -send you in this letter the main amendments which are still outstanding, together with the reasons for them and suggestions for use in explanation to the Sultan, 2* We hope that you now have sufficient material to be able , to explain to the Sultan the meaning of the definition of ’’nationals of His Majesty” in Article 1 (2) and that, in accordance with the view expressed in our telegram No.41'of the 7th October to Muscat, he will be willing to accept the definition as it is at present. If however he cannot be persuaded to do this, we would be prepared, if necessary, to substitute the following for the first sentence of Paragraph (2):- ’’The term ’nationals of His Majesty’ or references to nationals of a High Contracting Party in relation to His Majesty mean;- (u r ***U' 45^^ ftjlic lS ‘ ^ ^ - and the term ’nationals of the Sultan* or references to nationals of a High Contracting Party in relation to the Sultan mean all the Sultan’s subjects, wherever domiciled.” /3. We (1) All citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies except those belonging to^territories to which the present Treaty does not apply jj* (2) All Southern Rhodesian citizens provided that the present Treaty applies to Southern Rhodesia by reason of extension under Article 15; and (3) All British protected persons except nationals of Kuwait, etcetera, and except those belonging to territories to wnich the present Treaty does not apply])* i- Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I,, Bahrain. -rr-r/ 3. ^»e uncerstand fTom your telegram No. 9 Tour of the 11th October that the Oultan is prepared to consider the inclusion of our draft of the last sentence of article 2 (1) as the second sentence of article 3 (l). The draft of Article 3 (l) would then read as follows ''Nationals of one ^igh Contracting .tarty shall enjoy throughout the territories of the other with respect to commerce, shipping and the exercise of trace all the rights, privileges, immunities, advantages and protection, of whatsoever nature, which are or may be enjoyed by the nationals of the latter ^igh Contracting Party or the nationals of any other foreign country. Jach High Contracting Party shall allow in his territories the nationals of the other to bargain for, barter, buy, sell, import and export all kinds of goods on the same conditions as are or may be applicable to his own nationals or to the nationals of any other foreign country.' If the oultrn agrees to tnis transfer w regard it as important that our v.ordi/ng should be re u incd, including the laot phrase covo in4 M.F.H. treatment. hs explained in our telegram No. 42 / of the 7th October to -uscat, the second sentence is merely a particularisation of the first and since m.F.N. tr .atrnent is granted under t ie first, it would be inconsistent not to ^rant it in the second, we hope the bultan will see theforce of this, but if he cannot be persuaded to accept our draft (and particularly this point) we should rieh to omit the second sentence altogether. 4* In our telegram No. 42 we mentioned the necessity to make reservations in article 3 as a result of our taxation regulations. In oroer to meet the particular .^int we had in mind, which relates to the t ,rant of certain allowances to British subjects who are not resident in the United Kingdom, we should like to add a sentence to Paragraph (2) of article 3? which would now read as follows;: 'Nationals of one High Contracting i arty shall not be liable to taxes, duties, imposts, restrictions or obligations of any description whatever, other than or more onerous than those to which the nationals of the other or the nationals of any other forei n country are or may be subjected, provided however that nothing in this Article shall be construed in relation to any territory of either High Contracting party as obliging that High Contracting Party to ^rant to nationals ol the other, who are not resi ent for tax purposes in that territory the same personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for ts3c purposes as are 0 ranted to his own nati-oiks.' V.e suggest that it should be explained to the Sultan that certain allowances in the form of deductions from income tax) are granted to individuals who pay tax in the United Kingdom. These are mainly to take account of their family circumstances. Normally persons not resident in the United Kingdom are not entitled to those allowances, but a British subject who is not so resident receives a part of them (the part is the proportion which his income5. -e may also have to the ^ultun to a. ree to a reservation regarding the effect of double taxation agreements. We feel however that this can best be done by exchange of letters. 6. Instead of adding a paragraph to article 6 to cover the question of Burma, we think it best to add to the lest in article 1 (5) • This mmmm the addition of the T° rci u r ari( ^ i,or tIle P ur P ose -Article 6, Burma' after the Irish Kepublic. ^ ihe Treasury have agreed that the further^ exception to ^rtide 10, mentioned in our telegram ho. 42 / is unnecessary since the likelihood of balance of payme: ts diffic Ities with iviuscst is remote. ^ 3. We understand from your tele^iom ^o. IQ^four that the bultan is now willing to accept in the new Treaty an Article similar to Article 12 of the 1939 Treaty, although we are not quite clear in what way he suggests it might be brought up to date'. Article 12 of our draft is of course based entirely on article 12 of the 1T39 Treaty with one or two drafting amendments and the ministry of Transport are anxious to retain as much of it as possible. It seems clear that the bulta^s objections centre round rara^raph (4) and the Ministry agree taat we might suggest the following alternative wording to take the place of the la t three lines in the text of the draft:- 'The Sultan shall render all practicable assistance to recover the stolen property.' This appears to make t e paragraph much less objectionable and concentrates on the main objective, i.e. recovery of what is lost. If, however, the Sultan is not prepared to accept even this modification, the Ministry a, ree to the omission of this Paragraph in toto in oroer to save ohe rest ojff the Article as it now stance. The Colonial Office would like to see the inclusion of the following sentence at the end of Para ranh (l} of Article 15:- ' 'Any such extension may be subject to such modifications and conditions as, with the agreement of the Sultan, His Hajosty may specify.' The hki in roc son lor this is the existences of colonial marketing organisations which would make it impossible in practice for full reciprocal treatment to be extended by /certainMPi certain Colonies under article 3 (l) , and there rnay be other circumstances in some of the Colonies which wo Id conflict with certain provisions of the Treaty* .hen extendn^, this requirement to the cultan, hows er, we do not want to meation the marketing organisations since there might appear to him tobe some inconsistency between our admission of their existence and our previous attempts to .et him to accept Paragraph (2) of Article 2 (which has now been admitted) . we surest therefore that the following arguments should be used: (i) the different circumstances and arran 0 ements prevailing in different Colonies may, a a result of the grant of reciprocity in certain rticles, make it necessary for some resei'vation to be made, by agreement with the oultan, when the Treaty is extended to a particular Colony; (ii) we therefore suggest that this sentence sho Id be included in the text of the Treaty and that individual nodifications should be negotiated sep jly as and when they are required. ..Aether or not the sentence is included, it will still be necessary to make the reservations in certain cases and in any case this can only be done by the agreement of the bultan. we think therefore that there is an advantage in having a specific statement to this effect included in the text of the Treaty as signed so that the colonies themselves and both high Contracting Parties are aware of it; and ( ili) A*tPe*&amp;tl 60 oi&gt;etAagi faklt p&amp;xjt&amp;Sia* House feSvs2y$&amp;iN§Si«tfifefe&lt;a *&gt;«P§¥ 88 u 8 fy 1 lament 6 oes AfritoWSUtev mean 6 &lt;taa«ASP*«hlOh‘‘g#«»leS a «j 4 kiife»c¥ 8 [ 3 !e»feaefl?»S %Q A'&amp;SSat was able to claim reciprocal treatment. Howevel?, whereas under the old Article 16 the u-e&amp;^ifon lay^ with the Colony concerned and the oulx,. n had no alternative but to acoeae, under the present proposal it is for the dultan to agree to any reservation which is required. If, however, the Sultan is not willing to accept this addition, we can, in view of the point made in (ii) above, agree if necessary to leave it cut. ' 1C. .e have unfortunately been unable to fmb a co, y of the dote about “British vessels' referroo lo in Paragraph(2) of your telegram No. 18 Tour♦ &gt;.e assume that this was the only copy prepared for the oultan’s information and handed to him at one of the meetings in 193 ^. w© ct^n either provide a new statement or else, if he agrees to let us have a copy of the present one, say whether or not it is still correct. \.9 have also so far been unable to trace the letter from ..alton about “corporate bodies', but are pursuing our search. It might, however, be quicker if Gethin were able to obtain a co of the text. 11. We are having your- Pull row rs prepared and will despatch them as soon as pos ible. If we are to ^et the Treaty ratified by the end of the present period of relongationtnis eeenr hardly practicable now. It seems probable therefore that althoagh the Treaty will be si^ned before the 31st December it will not be ratified in time to oome intoforce on the 1st January. In 1939 th bultan a reed to telegraphic confirmation of ratification with th normal document following later. If he is willing to atroe to the some this time the process will be considerably speed up. I am not quite clear at what sta e the i'reaty snould be translated into rablff, presumably since inglish is the authoritative text, this need not be done ax1 ' e *’,. s ^&lt;' na£ ' ure » but should be ^lad if you would kindly confirm tnis.

During nsy visit to Nuecat the Sultan talked to ne at gxeat length about the procedure to be observed on the signing of the Treaty, and asked that everything sho Id be arranged as in 1939* He said that on that occasion his and our English and Arabic versions of the Treaty were first sent to the Consulate and sealed with his and Fowls's seals. The seals were linked up with blue silk ribbon. After that a ceremony was held at his palace where ha and Fowle signed the Treaty in the presence of about twenty-five British and kusc&amp;ti officials. He rcade a speech before the signing of the Treaty and ^owleImplied. After signature he and Fowls exchan ^ the pens which they had used. Coffee was then served and the meeting broke up. 2 # It appears froc the sbeve that I shall require a seal, some silk ribbon and a pen suitable for presentation to the Sultan. I am told that Fowls had no signet ring and that a seal was specially prepared for him at the Foreign Office bearing his name 'T. C. Fowle'. I have a signet ring bear ng the family crest and I presume this will suffice. If not, I request that I may be supplied vdth a seal bearing ay name similar to that used by Fowle. I presume the Foreign Office will supply the blue silk ribbon and the pen. I do not kasw what sor* of pen is used on such occasions, but I could probably purchase a gold mounted Parker pen In the bazaar here if considered suitable. 3. On the last occasion the Sultan gave his ratification when the Treaty was signed and I gather His Majesty's ratification was signed only five days later and presented to the Sultan by the Consul -hen it arrived. The Sultan hopes that His Majesty's ratification will be received on this occasion with the same rapidity. He also expressed some anxiety about the Arabic translation of the Treaty. I gather that on the last occasion, considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining a good translation and T have been told that a sum of £.70 was eventually paid to a professor in Oxford to make one. I would suggest that the matter of the Arabic translation should be taken in hand at onme as m-st of the Treaty is, I hope, more or less in its final form, and that an advance copy of the translation should be sent to the Sultan to look through before he la asked to sign it. 5 # I very much hope that everything will be ready so that the Sultan and I can sign the Treaty not later than the middle of December. I have asked the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, kindly to arrange for me to travel to Muscat in one of His Majesty’s ships if possible. 6. The Sultan said nothing about my authority to sign the Treaty, but I presume this will be sent to me and that I should hand it to the Sultan before I make ny signature. R.F. Cr.

PERSIAN GULF.lO^J Copy of note recorded by Sir Rupert Hay while on tour at Muscat on 124 -th October 1951. \J^r The Sultan has informed me that the following procedure was followed when the 1939 Treaty was signed. The Treaty was first sent to the Consulate where it was sealed with his and Sir Trenchard Powle’s seals. I gather that the latter was a small seal bearing Sir Trenchard Powle’s name. After that a cerenony was held at his palace with himself in a big chair on one side of the table and the Political Resident in a similar chair on the other side. About twenty-five British Government and Consulate officials were present. He made a speech and Sir Trenchard Powle replied. The Treaty was then brought out by subordinate officials and signed, and he and Sir Trenchard Powle then exchanged the pens with which they had made their signatures. Coffee was then served and the meeting broke up. The Sultan asked that the same proeedure be observed on the present occasion. He proposes to arrange for photographers to be present.'(EA 1053/96) C0H?IDEHTIAL COPY F0PEIG1T OFFICE, 3.\Y. 1. 22nd OctolDer, 1951* IX Dear Sir Rupert, S-^3 (Ai We can agree 7 to the Sultan 1 s modifications and amendments to the Consular/Article of the Muscat Treaty as reported in your telegram Ro.1 O'Tour of 13th October from Muscat, We wonder though whether there is any possibility that the Sultan might be induced to change his mind about the substitution of ’’Consular Officers” for 'Consuls”. We find it difficult to understand his objection to the change, which would obviate the need for clarification in a separate letter, since the term 'Consular Officer” is the one normally used in Consular Conventions e. g. In the unratified Anglo-United States Convention. ^ 2. If however the Sultan is quite adamant or you consider the P \ point not worth pursuing, he should be asked to confirm, as he has promised, that he understands the term 'Consuls” as including as ./ell as consuls, consuls-general, vice-consuls and consular agents, together with persons holding any of these ranks in an acting capacity. 3* In the letter which is addressed to the Sultan on this subject we think it will be as well to inform him that if cir cumstances require we may later wish to approach him with a view to concluding a separate and comprehensive Consular Convention, and to express the hope that he will be willing to consider favourably any such proposal. This might be necessary if the importance of Muscat ./ere to increase during the term of the Treaty or if the Sultan wished to appoint a Consul in the United Kingdom, //here, for example, our interest would be to approve and consent to the area to be included in the Consular district rather than the place at which the Consul resides. In 1933 and 1939 a number of letters were exchanged with the Sultan in connexion with the Treaty negotiations. V/e have already asked for and received your views on the applicability of these to the present negotiations (the last letter was from Le nuesne to Cranston Ho. 1041/74 of 31st August). The situation is a little different no./ that .ve are not to have a full-scale fjbn$ular Convention. , 7/e are advised that the matters dealt with in the Sultan’s letter of 7th July, 1933 to the Resident cannot be considered as covered by international law and practice. Do you therefore think it desirable to ask the Sultan to confirm that the undertakings about imports by the Consul given in this letter apply to the nev Treaty as well as the old, and to obtain similar confirmation in respect of the letter about the residence of the Consul in Muscat? Since there is in fact no mention of the Treaty in either of these letters, confirmation may not be necessary. The Ministry of Transport have confirmed that the letters relating to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service are no longer applicable and ipy be allowed to lapse. Years sincerely, (R. F. G.
