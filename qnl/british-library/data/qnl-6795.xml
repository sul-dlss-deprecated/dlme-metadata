B. 231. THE ADEN PROTECTORATE. Lottc ; r 1,10 Cenoral Oifierr Commanding Aden, to the Secretary the government oi India, Foreign Department, dated 13th May Ihlfi.' Aden, to the Secretary to r J}! 0 not0 u ' as ,,iad&lt; * at Jli y ^quest by Colonel li. A. Wauhope, I also attach a note on the Political aspect of allairs in the Yemen by Lieutenant-Colonel H. Jacob, First Assistant Resident. 1. It. appears to me that four alternatives present themselves for consideration as future possibilities: — (1) I o remain on the passive defence in Aden with a covering force at Sheikh Othman as at present. (-) ^ () advance to Lahej and occupy positions commanding the outlet from the I iban delile along which only any military road from northwards approaches Aden. ('•&gt;) lo advance to our old frontier line of protectorate delimitation, and to occupy Dala. (1) To occupy Taiz, thus assuming a Protectorate over the whole south west corner of the Yemen, with a new frontier line strategically and politically defensible. 3. lo any or all of these may be added the occupation of Sheikh Said on the mainland opposite 1 erim. In the case of the adoption of-propositions (1), (2) or (3), such an occupation must, almost of necessity, be added. But in the case of (4) would probably be unnecessary. 4. In the consideration of these propositions in detail a limitation is fixed by our necessary ignorance of the future. But it appears to me that, even with our present knowledge, certain conclusions may be arrived at conditionally, and that it will be of advantage to discuss these. 5.—(I) In the past it has been found practically impossible to regard Aden as an isolated post disconnected from the hinterland. In the future it will be found even more difficult to regard it from this point of view. It seems likely that persistence in such a policy may lead to very serious complications with Furopean Powers. From a military point of view the Sheikh Othman position does not afford any natural defence, and does not give sufficient elbow-room for operations of any importance. Politically it is ineffective. Any further discussion of this proposition appears unnecessary, as 1 feel sure that no authority would recommend its adoption except as a last alternative. (2) Lahej offers a position with a better radius of action for any troops stationed there. It is closer to Aden than any other centre at which a hostile force could collect for an attack on Aden, provided Sheikh Othman is held. It therefore offers the advantage of interior lines as compared with other centres, and it could be safely held. It is well situated for controlling the Arabs of the coast. If the Arabs be joined in strength by the Turks, or by the Imam’s forces, it offers a position blocking the approaches to Aden. The only line that offers any advantages to a force advancing from the north as a line of communication is that from Mavia and Taiz by the W. Warezan and \Y. A khan routes converging in the NY. Tiban route. It is oidy by this route that water for any force larger than a battalion can be found. The Turks and Arabs have no organised system of supply, S 308 JO—6/lOlt).and must live on the surrounding country; therefore they must station themselves at the larger trade centres such as Lahej, Mavia and Taiz. D a } a also is such a centre, but Musemir is not. If Lahej be denied to them they must stay at some of the centres named but they cannot consolidate themselves elsewhere, except temporarilv at Musemir. But if Lahej is not held, a large concentration can be effected within a day’s march of Aden. The last stage of the issue of the W. Tiban route from the foothills forms a narrow defile. If a force attempting to issue from the defile were attacked during the movement, they would be liable to defeat in detail and to suffer disaster. If the enemy are allowed to concentrate, with all their strength outside the defile, the only disadvantage that they suffer from is that they are fighting with their backs to it, but they hold the exit. If attacked when half out of the defile the advantage should be with the attackers. There is a position at Tannan which commands the exit from the defile but it is not tit lor permanent occupation owing to the heat striking off the rocks in the restricted area. Nobat Dakim which is miles south of Tannan is extremely unhealthy and malarious. At A1 Anad, the tracks from the north are obstructed by a hill, and this forms a supporting position about 7 miles south of Tannan. It is less unhealthy than Nobat Dakim and has a plentiful supply of water. The Turks have a hospital here. There is good water from a spring in the W. Tiban near Zaida and open ground suitable for a camp, but no shade. This would be the Lest place for the hutted camp of a force detailed to hold the Tannan position. It is situated about 11 miles south of Tannan. The places mentioned above can be occupied in such a way by a force of three or lour battalions with guns as to deny the approach to Lahej to a force of very much greater strength. From a defensive point of view it is exceedingly strong, but as regards the health of the troops it is, owing to the presence of mosquitoes, rather worse than Aden or Sheikh-Othman. It has, however, many advantages over either of the latter, because it covers the fertile area of the Lnhej district, from which vegetables, Ac., can be obtained, because it practically prohibits an advance from Mavia, and because it controls the coast tribes in the vicinity of Aden. It is, in my opinion, the least advance that should be made. If made, it should be clear from the outset that it is a permanent move, and that we go to stay. In any case, even if a further advance has been decided on, it must be the first stage of such an advance. It would be well to pause and consolidate hen 1 before attempting anything more. Until the railway has been brought up, and troops have been exercised in the hilly country and hill camels have been collected, these positions should be made good. consider the advisability of occupying Sheikh Said. This is a collection of barren rocky hills with L&gt; or 20 grass huts used h lisheimen who are the only normal inhabitants. 1 he Turkish telegraph 1m of the \ emen passed over from here to Derim. There were a fort and soim jarracks on J. Utba near lurba, but these have been demolished. Then is no natmal harbour (the Khor is only a shallow inlet), nor is there here i natural tiade centre. I here is water, but it is brackish; the local Arab ( i m \ it, but no one else can. 1 he I urldsh garrison obtains water brought oi pack animals from Bal Hajari and Dubai). It is unlikely, judging by the formation of the underground streams from the main hills of the occupation must entail the erection of condensers. o i IV'T,' 1 ^heikh Said to us lies in its position dominating th Bab-al-Mandab Straits. H' it were properly armed by another power wo could not hold Perm whiclt provides the natural harbour, of which Sheikh Said should be normally, the defence. land, that there are am interior.

' 1 ' IC( ''P}’ the Iaiz District in a military sense, it seems that, it will he necessary that Sheikh Said should he occupied ami garrisoned. ‘ r !| s the 1 inks look like withdrawing from the war we ought to take it, hut not sooner than is necessary. As already indicated, its further defence and the garrisoning of this place must depend on the decision arrived at with regard to J aiz. Ihe third alternative is contained in the proposition that we should advance to Dala and makegood our line as delimited on our maps. 1 have been unable to discover any other reasons for originally going to Dala Ilian that id) it provided a much needed sanitarium for the Aden Garrison ; (b) it brought us into closer contact with the Hinterland tribes; (c) we could not go to Taiz. Dala does not close any route practicable for an army, and it is turned at ome b\ an\ hostile advance from the north-west by the l ibau route. It is a place of little strategical importance, and the question of an advance to this place need not therefore be further discussed. It is not worth any risk. (1) This last proposition, viz, to occupy Taiz, has been discussed hy Colonel \\ anhope in his memorandum herewith attached. It. is undoubtedly by fur the most attractive proposition. It appears to me to be worthy of the deepest consideration. It is a big scheme and would require a force of, probably, two divisions to inaugurate it, and a permanent force of a division, aftor things had settled down. It would be necessary to carry on the railway Jrom Aden to Taiz and desirable to continue the railway to lias Kathib just north of Uodeida. This railway would be guarded from attack from the north by a mountain barrier through which we should hold the passes. The project might entail trouble with the Imam Vehia, but would be favourably viewed by our friend the Idrisi, to whom we might offer the coast country southwards from Lahaya to Ras Kathib. Hv this means, and by strengthening the Sultan of Mokalla, would be formed a barrier to foreign intrigue and occupation around the whole of the coasts of Southern Arabia. All the advantages of a sanatarium would be available for our troops in the line climate round Taiz. Any force maintained here would be exceedingly well placed strategically for use in Persia, India, East Africa, the Red Sea litoral, or in the West. The whole trade of the Yemen would increase vastly under a stable govern ment and would lind a natural exit by rail either to Ras Kathib or Aden. The new frontier would be naturally defensible. On the civil administration of the triangular tract between this frontier and the seas I am not in a position to offer an opinion, but perhaps it might be run on the same lines as the Sudan. I agree with Colonel \Y an hope in the opinion that Indian troops are least suitable for employment in Arabia, especially Indian Muhammadans, who seem to become hypnotised by the thought that they are in the land in which lies Mecca. It seems possible that Sudanese troops might do better. But in any case time and money would, in my opinion, be well spent in an attempt to form a local corps of Arabs under British ollrcers. They will not take kindly at first to too strict a discipline, but according to nil available information there are many good lighting men who would enlist if required. aThere are Arabs who are hard working, as is evidenced by their good work when coaling steamers and as stokers. g. The First Assistant Resident advocates, as docs Colonel Wauhope, the advancement of our sphere of influence to 1 aiz. In f&lt;u t tin end he has in view coincides with proposition (4). But he proposes methods which have, to my mind, proved a failure in the past. The undertaking of political obligations supported by no adequate measures for their fulfilment, and the building of railways in country outside our jurisdiction, appear to me to be open to grave objections, If, therefore, it be decided to advance from Aden, an adequate force to ensure the fulfilment of all obligations and guard our interests and a suitable location for that force, for which Aden is quite unsuitable, appear to me to be essential elements in any practical proposition. In short, any satisfactory scheme must meet the strategical as well as the political requirements of the situation. As for a Chiefs’ College, Aden is no place for it. More healthy sur roundings and a cooler climate are essential. But no one would suggest that it should be outside our border. To push the Turks back through the passes and beyond our protectorate border will probably require the concentration of a force of two divisions. No greater force would be required to push them beyond Mavia and Taiz and there should be no retirement thence. For some time to come this force would probably be not more than sufficient to cope with the dissatisfaction of the Imam of Sanaa, unless we come to terms with him before we advance. Although the Idrisi might assist us in engaging him in case he declines to come to terms. Although it may appear to-the Arabs that any advance to Taiz is due to a desire for personal or national aggrandisement, such an advance would be, in my opinion, forced upon us from no such desire. I believe the advance will be forced upon us by considerations not only of self-preservation at Aden but of the preservation of the best interests of the Arabs. If it is, I can see no advantages but great danger in attempting to make it without adequate force. 1 am fully aware that our action here is dependent on success or failure in other distant fields of action, but any success in distant spheres will not entirely compensate for local inaction. I therefore submit these papers in case a possibility for action should present its If, in the hope that they may be found of some use in due course. I have, Ac., Wm. 0.

The BorxDAitv of the Aden Tkotectorate. \ot( l&gt;y (!oloycl L\ A. Wauhop* U.E. t C.ll., !• Bi 1 f&gt;o&lt; &gt; the Turkish occupation of Vemen which had lasted nearly 100 years came to an end. and from that year until the reconquest of Sana’a in jS7L ) the province was ruled hy the imams of Sana’a, the descendants of the ancient dynasty established in the ninth Century, A.D. Their hold over the outlying districts gradually weakened, and in 1839 when Aden was captured by the British, the Abdali Sultan, who then held it, was independent of the Imam and had extended his influence over the adjoining tribal territory. This was so far recognized by the British Government that in 1839 the sovereignty of the Imam was ignored and a treaty made with the Abdali, under which the British Government became responsible for the stipends paid by him to the Kadli, Yafai, llaushabi and Amiri tribes for safeguarding the routes to Aden. Direct relations with these tribes were entered into later, and treaties made extending British protection to them in return for certain obligations which they undertook, but the limits of the Protectorate remained until recently as we took them over on our first occupation of Aden. 3. Turkish intervention in Yemen recommenced about 1840, but it was not till 1872 that the advance of the Turks brought them into contact with the tribes in treaty relations with us. In that year they advanced from Kataba, occupied a large part of the Amiri territory, and deposed the Amir of Dala, and, in spite of remonstrances from the British Government, pushed on as far as Lahej, which they only evacuated under strong diplomatic pressure. The Porte then admitted that certain specified tribes were within the British sphere of influence ; but their aggressive policy was persisted in, until in 1901 the British Government found it necessary to expel a Turkish force from a post established at Ad Dareja in llaushabi territory. A Commission was then appointed by the two Governments to determine the boundary of the specified tribes, and this was agreed upon and demarcated on the ground, from Sheikh Said to a point near Kataba, beyond which it was agreed that the boundary should run north-east up to the desert, thus cutting off Turkish access to Baihan and the Hadramaut Valley. 4. The preceding paragraphs show that the present boundary, though recently agreed to by Turkey, was acquired by us at a time when neither Turkey nor the Imam had any recognized rights in the neighbourhood of Aden ; this is perhaps important to notice at the present time when the Imam may be inclined to make claims which his predecessors did not think of bringing forward 80 years ago. it is also interesting to note that the (h&gt; facto rulers of Aden, from whom we inherited, so to speak, the present frontier, found it necessary to subsidize the tribes commanding the approaches to Aden ; and that it was even then impossible to regard Aden as an isolated position, and without interest in the hinterland through which its trade communications run. 5 5. This boundary is in many ways an unsatisfactory one. It ignores military considerations entirely ; it follows no definite natural features ; and except at one point near Dala it denies us possession of the heights commanding the border, and of the fertile highlands, leaving to ns only the barren foothills and deserts. The possession of Mavia and the high plateaux to the north of it would have changed the position entirely in our favour; we could then have established outposts in a healthy climate covering all the approaches to Aden from the north-west. Short of that line there is nor, place in all the intprmudiate country where troops could remain ;i week witlmi being decimated by sickness. A garrison at Mala would have had m, ctlV, 1 . 1 , and would itself have been cut olf by the Turkish advance irom the Tib- Valley on Lahej. rnfortimately, Turkish aggression had gone too Jar ai 1 '! no other boundary was then possible, but under the new conditions tV' must soon arise the whole question should be reconsidered. b. Il the 1 urks, after the war, are still to remain in Yemen, a bull'er zmh^ of tribal territory must still be maintained, but a more satisfactory homidui- must be found, such as will give us access to the highlands, and onsure &lt; il command .of the approaches to Aden. If, however, thev disappear from Yemen, a much larger question arises. The British Government can hardlv contemplate the occupation of Yemen, and with it of the Red Sea coast |,b any other Power, and will itself be committed to some form of protector-ite over the province. The greater part may remain independent, or under Arab ride, but, in order to develop its resources, it may he necessarv to exercise control over the ports (which must continue open to Kiironcmi trade) and the main trade routes into the interior. A brief description of the general character of the country will show how far this is practicable or desuable, and a\ here we can establish ourselves so as to exercise this oniifn 1 with the least risk and outlay. 7. The northern limit of Yemen actually under Turkish administration is a line drawn eastward from Lahiya for about I I'O miles inland, and passim- about miles north of Sanaa ; the southern bounda.y is tlie line Sheikh Said—ivataba, as demarcated ; the eastern iioundary is some 20 miles east of the line Nma a—Ivataba, the whole averaging 200 miles in length from north to south, and li() miles in width.

Large quantities of grain and forage could be g .m il m the fertile district to the north-east, and sites for encamp- miits could lie found in the immediate neighbourhood, in an excellent climate, at any elevation desired. 10. \Vhatever Government is established in Yemen, it will be necessary to maintain, as at present, a zone of tribal territory entirely independent of oana a, and under British control. Taiz and its dependencies must be included m tins zone, and the present limits of the Protectorate must be extended westwards to some point on the Red Sea north of Mpklm. This southern corner of Arabia is of too great importance strategically to allow any doubt to exist m the luture as to its ownership, and our hold on it should be secured by the construction of a railway to Taiz, or some suitable point to the noifh-east of it, with a road extending from railhead eastward through . . ia . *. 0 l );da - Jt should be speciiically excluded from the Imam’s jurisdiction, although only a part of it would be, for the present at any rate occupied by us. 11. A well defined and defensible line* for the occupied district would 1 Sec Sheet 6U K.W. (S.W. Asia). be the crest of the range bounding the I'aiz valley on the north-west, through J. Nama, the Muharras Pass, J. Sorak, J. Masha and J. Jihaf to J. Ifarir 1 ; at each end ol this line the high ranges curve sharply back to the south, forming natural Hanks. Such a line fulfils the required conditions ; it gives us control of the approaches to Aden, and provides an ample choice of sites for encamp ments in a healthy climate within a few hours journey from the coast, where our frontier olficers will he in touch with the people of Yemen, as thev can never be in Aden. 12. The occupation of Hodeida or one of the Red Sea ports may also have to be considered. They serve the coffee growing districts of .labal Haraz, Raima and others, and the trade of Zabid and the other Tihama towns. Other European nations besides ourselves are concerned in their development, and will look to us for the maintenance of security. Railways have been projected by the Turks themselves to connect Hodeida with Sana’a and Taiz ; we cannot ignore the responsibilities involved in our Protectorate. 13. Tne adoption of this policy will entail, at the outset, the employment of a considerable force. It should be carried into effect with as little delay as possible on the withdrawal of the Turks; otherwise the country will relapse into anarchy, or the Imam will seize the opportunity to forestall us in the occupation of Mavia and Taiz. The necessary arrangements, political and military, should therefore lie considered at once, to ensure the advance being made at the right moment. PJ. As regards the constitution of the permanent garrison some important change would seem desirable. The greater part will in future be stationed in a cool and healthy climate, and a large proportion should, for some time to come, consist of British troops.The employment of Indian troops in Arabia is for many reasons in expedient ; the native element should therefore be recruited from the local tribesmen. Excellent material is available and will conn 4 forward as soon as the people are convinced that our Protectorate is really a permanent one. P. A. Wauhoim:, Political and Military Intelligence Ofiicer, Aden. • Enclosure No. 2. A Political Polk y in oi u Mlntf.ui.am). [Note by IjieutenanUColonel II. I'\ Jacob', I'irst Assistant Resident, Aden ) At the beginning of the war with Turkey everything was made to depend on a political policy. The Arabs were asked to create a diversion against the Turks. On this account precautionary measures of a military nature were put out of court and the seriousness of a Turkish movement was somewhat discounted from the military view-point. (1) The Idrisi agreement was made on dOth April 1915. Had the Idrisi Saiyid been more active, the descent on Lahej would have been delayed or entirely frustrated. (2) The Mavia Sheikh concluded an agreement on PJth February 1915. lie tried to do his part but we did not coirespond. Here too, had we done so, the move to Lahej would have forestalled. Mavia has never taken an active part against us. His arrival on the Dala plateau was the result of the Amir’s coquetting with the Kaim Makam of Kataba. Mavia deposed the Amir and put up a relative. He then changed his quarters and went to .Mavia. A brother of the present Abdali Sultan was deputed to meet him at Musemir. The house of Abdali, however, did not approve of the “Mavia agreement.’’ The Abdali did not want to see a strong rider in that quarter under our flag, which was the programme we had proposed and to which Mavia had assented. The Abdali mission failed on account of the mala droitness of its representative. Mavia would not lead the attack on Lahej, pleaded sickness, and was eventually put on the Turkish black list as pro- British. He was not present at the occupation of Lahej, and has ever since then been moving about in the neighbourhood of Mavia, while once, to deceive the lurks, he led another movement on the Dala plateau, this time against the Shairis. 5) I he Imam of Sanaa dislikes (lie I urks but distrusts our mission in Arabia after the bombardment of Sheikh Said in November 1914. He has always been friendly to the House of Abdali, and was very indignant with the Turks for their occupation of the Abdali capital. Writing to the Abdali Sultan so late as in April 1915, the Imam expu ssed his distiustof the Tmkish Oovernment in the 5 emeu, and accused them of fomenting disturbances. He said he had no desire, save “ to bring “ together the scattered hearts of his brethren in the faith and to keep alive “ tlie dickering soul of the Islamic Nation.” He reiterated his linn friendship with the House of Lahej and said he would always remain in friendly relations with the House. The Imam’s Lieutenant, Saiyid Mohamed Ali Sharif, also wrote to the Sultan. He said that the Governor-General of the Yemen and other self- interested persons in Sana’a had conspired to accuse the writer of visitin' Aden and receiving doles. The Imam, his master, then wrote it stiff note to the Governor-General and protested against certain Turkish acts and suspicions which were contrary to the spirit of the Turco-Imamic truce Hie writer added that disagreement between the Imam and the Turks might any day take shape. He concluded that it was impossible for the Imam to join the Abdab but lie promised neutrality and an abiding consideration for those under Abdah protection ; that the Imam had noted the object of some designing persons (i.e., I urks), and he thereupon collected his forces and would make his own expedition when necessary. The writer had asked theD 1 uiciiiv Ins object m tukm^; a force against the district of Bed country, whereupon the Imam withdrew the same. Boda had Imam’s objective. a and adjacent long been the 2. All this goes to show that the Imam did not approve of Turkish measures against Lahej. He does not admire Turkish methods of rule but for the time he finds it the best policy to abide by the terms of the Treatv he made prior to the I urco-Italiau war. Had these political measures succeeded, we should have combated the i urks by proxy and very economically. Tire re was a military side, and co-operation on our part was essential, f will not here criticise the causes which led us to refrain. It is better to face the facts and see what should be done in the future. 1 base my remarks on the hypothesis that the Turks will be expelled from the Yemen. 3. When the Turks retire, the border line will be a thing of the past. Chaos will succed. The Turk is at present the cork in a bottle of beer. When the cork is drawn the beer will foam over. The democracy of the Arab only adds to the difficulty. The Arab lacks cohesion. What has been said of Spain by a distinguished writer in the year 1830 is true of the Yemen to-day. Repelling intercourse with other nations, the Yemen is thrown back upon herself. This isolation, however, does not unite the separate tribes in any community of national feeling. The contrary is the case. Bound together in provincial clanship, the inhabitants know themselves and their neighbours not so much as Arabs, but as Shafa’i and Zeidi, Yafai hillsmen and those of tin; plains; Aulaki, Audhali, Bedani, &amp;c. Tribes may be bought and re-bought by different and opposing parties. If the Turk goes, the Arabs will rejoice at regaining their independence. Will they then welcome our taking over Turkish rights and liabilities ? 1'he Imam opposes Turkish rule, not because he loves us, but rather because he considers the Yemen the property of his forbears. The raid on Lahej he abhorred just because Lahej he considered a part and parcel of his ancient domain and he had a secret treaty with the late Sir Ahmed Fadl of Lahej. When in 1040 the Turks left the Yemen, the Imam took it over. Will he now after this lapse of time, with a similar disappearance of the Turks, be content to be cribbed, cabined and confined in the tracts now assigned him by the Turks, i.e., in the Northern Yemen ? When we told the Imam we did not seek territorial expansion in the Yemen and asked him to join us to expel a foe to Arab progress, he at once instanced our attack on Sheikh Said as belying that assertion ; that we were poaching on his preserve, and he could not believe that no ulterior motive lay behind our desire for his friendship. 4. I have said that our border line will be a tabula rasa when the Turk goes. This line was-drawn between ourselves and the Turks, and not between us and the Arabs. The Arabs have never recognised the line. The line cut in two tribes who had for years considered themselves one in attack and defence. I speak of Juban, Xawa, Bani Da by an and Mausta. Juban in the division went over to the Turks. The Sheikh made frequent and feverish appeals to be taken over by us. He was as often told that he was within borders of our good friends the Turks. When the Turk goes, the Treaty between us and the Ottoman Government of March 1914 is also a dead letter. 1 refer to the Turkish recognition of the prolongation of the north-east line from Lakamat al Ashub. 5. We must work back to our delimited border and expel the Turks who have crossed it, and in crossing have taken over the Haushabi and Aixnri tribesmen. 0. Until we take over our former borders we shall have lost caste with our Arab proteges and it will be idle fur us to talk of a delimitation of our borders vis-a-vis the Imam. S 308 c Wmmi33 10 H j 7. A new border is imperative. W'e must keep the Imam, if possible within a certain prescribed area. Colonel Wauhope advises that we i'O ui) to Taiz. 1 am not sure of the advisability of the mean* he proposes, though the end in view is admirable. The Turks had made Taiz their headquarters and had before this war practically left tin* Imam supreme in the Norther' Yemen. We, too, should keep him there and not allow him to come south 8. 1 do not advocate a “forceful penetration” of this new area. 1 ,1 0 not believe that the Arabs will welcome us as steppers into Turkish shoes The Turks were, at any rate, Moslems, even if bad Moslems. They derived their rule in the Yemen from their Caliph. Their rule was despotic and detested. The Arabs liked our presence at Dala up to 11)07, but only because we did not harass them. We did not administer the countrv but unosten tatiously supervised their administration. We levied no taxes. The Turks disarmed all whom they thought dangerous to their rule and then taxed the people by force. Should we begin to adniinistc}- the country, our populnntv would cease; but unless we imitate in principle the Turkish regime wo- cannot stay in the country and make our stay pecuniarily prolitable. Ik For this reason I do not recommend a forceful occupation of the country. 1 think we can best rule there by proxy. We can take over Taiz Shurman, and Kama Ira and the Mogariya district, and in fact, all southward to Sheikh Said, but. this tract should be merely a “sphere of influence” a sphere where we will brook no foreign power to come in, just as our present treaties stipulate for no cession or sale of lands, which by stipends paid we consider as exclusively within the British sphere. The Mavia Sheikh administered the Taiz and Mavia tracts under the Turks: Ahmed Neman that of Uogariya under the same masters. We should follow suit, though it would be well to give over a part of the Hogariya district to the Abdali who has lost much, pecuuiarilv and morally, before and since 1th duly by espousing our cause?, f say *'our cause’’ advisedly, for though Lahej was his, and his interests mainly at stake, yet by treaty we were pledged to safeguard his territorv. 10. In order to open this country, a railway to Taiz will be 1 he best means. Iheie are many ways of greatly extending our influence over this new tract, and I have enumerated some of them in my Memorandum of 9th September 1915, which was forwarded to (ioverument by Cleneral Sir (f. Younghusband, with his letter No. &lt; ’. (*,91, dated iTird September 1915. these measures include levies, a school in Aden for Chiefs’ sons, Ac. Bv these means we shall prove to the Arab our sincerity when we asked them to oust the I urks, who for many years had been a block to Arab progress in t e emeu, and further when we denied all idea of personal aggrandisement. I. I he most ilifhcult problem before 11 $ will bo to placate tbe Imam, ami tins is best done by putting up an inlluential Arab in the Taiz district- one, however, who happens to be anti-Zeidi, as indeed lie is anti-Turk. ^ i' ;T; e -'* l,ls treaties with the Arabs, we must either retain repudiate them.

The question of making fresh treaties will depend on the exact position of he new line and the attitude of tribesmen when we retakeX country up to the old boundary. lerake tne Heda is well within our present sphere, but so far the Sultan has not bum able to come down to us. In view of the Imam’s aspirations in that direction, the Beda Freaty seems verv essential. The Iladramaut and its uplands should be left in our hands and consolidated under his rule. Tim Imam has long aspired to extend I,is spiritual s»av in this tract winch l&gt;e would approach by the Beda country. This is an old and pet .(.heme of Ills which the I urco-Italmn war postponed ton more convenient “T'Vm ,e b- eap , 0, ' t 0t ,! he K,uiti titan’s domains is the growing poil of Mok.dla. 1 his place calls for the i&gt;rese|ice of a British agent The country has great potentialities, and there is a lot of discontent and unrest fomented by the hatlun Sultan who is hacked by Java and Singapore dollais. \\ e should put all our money on the Kuaiti and bolster him up as best we can. 1 In. It is by the railway and roads and by levies and by a Chiefs’ College that we can best penetrate the Yemen and leave Arabia for the Arabs under t he British mgis ; but wo must first of all work back to the border which the I urks lately crossed. A diplomatic set-back of Turks will be mischievous and suicidal, and will wreck all our hopes of posing in the future as the Arabs’ best friend. Unless we go back by force, the Yemen will become the happy hunting ground of other European nations, who will, however, hesitate to challenge our position as the Bower exercising actual oversight. lb. 1 believe the Imam will be the readier to listen to our wish to live in peaceful juxtaposition with him if we put up an Arab in the Southern Yemen, lie might perpetually intrigue against us, but that he would do even after we had conquered the whole country by force, and this latter method has the demerit of leaving a smouldering resentment against us in the Arab mind and speaks of annexation. I&lt;. lor this reason l think that a policy of annexation of extra territory should be discounted as a dangerous policy. I would except the port of Ilodeida which, il in our hands, would be a useful sop on occasion to quiet the Cerberus of Sana a. Aden, Ilodeida and Mokalla control the entrance of supplies at three important places. IS. I do not discuss the Iclrisi border. That is a matter beyond our immediate ken. He will not object to our proposed role of general super vision over certain territories now in Turkish hands. He himself proposed we should capture Hodeida. The Idrisi border will seek expansion vis-d-vis the Imam’s in the Northern Yemen, it will be our business to adjudicate between these two chiefs. The role of adjudicator will not be suffered unless we work back to the delimited border ’twixt ourselves and the Turks. H. F. Jacob, Ijiculeiuiut-Colonel, First Assistant Besident, Aden.

The letter outlines four options for how the British may best handle the current political situation in Aden, a British Protectorate. Attached to the letter are two enclosures which largely support Walton's ideas. The first enclosure is written by Colonel Robert Alexander Wauhope, Political and Military Intelligence Officer, Aden, and details the history of 'The Boundary of the Aden Protectorate'. The second enclosure is written by Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Fenton Jacob, First Assistant Resident, Aden, and provides information on 'A Political Policy in our Hinterland'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>First Assistant Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>General Officer Commanding, Aden Field Force</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political and Military Intelligence Officer, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Protectorates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sailing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000259#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
