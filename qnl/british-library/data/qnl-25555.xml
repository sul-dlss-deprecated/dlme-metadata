The Sheikh of Mohammerah, however, told His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah that if British had to attack Basra, Talib, acting in concert with them, could and would either raise a disturbance here or induce Arab troops to desert.

Great Britain, the greatest Muhammadan power m the world and the faithful and consistent friend of Turkey, whom she has steadfastly helped to maintain her position in Europe and to recover the stability shaken in the Balkan wars, has watched with the greatest regret, and has unceasingly made friendly efforts to arrest, the process by w ic i Turkey has been decoyed into ranging herself on the side of the enemies of Great Britain and her allies and adopting an attitude as unjustifiable as it is ungrateful.” Add new final paragraph :— “The climax was reached when without any warning and without the slightest provocation Bedouin tribes from Turkish territory invaded the Sinai peninsula and Turkish ships of war wantonly attacked open and undefended towns of a friendly country, thus m unprecedented manner violating the most ordinary rules of international law, comity, and usage.

On the 30th August, the Viceroy of India repeated to me an official communique, which it is proposed to publish in the event of a rupture between England and Turkey being imminent. The text of the communique was read by me yesterday to my Russian nnd French colleagues for their confidential information, and, as at present the relations between Great Britain and Turkey are a much-discussed topic and a 'Teat deal of bellicose nonsense is indulged in by young Chauvinists, I iook D advantage of the visits paid me yesterday by Imam Juma and the Prime Minister to explain that the recent action of the Turkish Government respecting the German cruisers “Goeben” and “ Breslau ’ had been highly mproper and that consequently our relations are slightly strained. I urged noon them the desirability of adopting measures for the prevention o openly hostile expressions against Great Britain and her allies m the present S I also particularly impressed upon the Imam that he should exercise Ids influence to stop any leaning which might be disp ayed towards religious demonstration! It was also suggested by me that the Amirs of Nejef and Kerbela might be cautioned to discourage hostile action against Great Britain and her ally Powers. . The Imam consented to act accordingly, but he assured me that people were well aware of all that the British Government have done for Persia and that lereTno fear of a display by Persians of serious activity. The Prime Minister mentioned to me that one can never answer unreservedly for a people where religion is concerned, but I was assured by him that the Government of Persia would observe strict neutrality even if the worst were to happen and he promised that he would take all necessary steps to check any attempt at a demonstration. The Prime Minister further stated confidentially that were it a question only t WHWiU between Turkey and Great Britain, we could depend on Persia s sympathies (all, he added depreciatingly, that has been left her with which to fi“tl on our side, but he had to admit that so great is the hatred lor Russians in Persia that he could not promise more than neutrality now that, owing to political considerations, we were fighting side by side. ^ _ French and Russian Ministers are, at my instigation, warning ^' dlsh and Russian officers of Gendarmerie and Cossack brigade respectively, to make preparations for a possible anti-Christian disturbance in fostering of which ^Taps without counting cost on the result f ^ a^outTueXrrth is without doubt busy spreading numerous talse stories about successes on tbe part of Germans.

Three of them departed for Basrah en route for Constantinople it was said. Sultan treated them with great respect and paid their steamer fares. The fourth Turk still remains here and is personal friend of Sultan.

From- His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, I can discover no trace of any such mission as that referred to m your ment, Simla. . r . ment, Simla,4 * “By a bombardment of Hodeida the hostile tribes of Zaranik would, it is believed, rise against the Turks. A short time ago their Sheikhs asked to come under the British Flags. We should also take Kamaran. The two Arab Chiefs above mentioned would be incited to a speedy rebellion by the bombardment of these ports for both of them despise Turkish protesta tions of Islam and detest Turkish methods. We should lose no time in honouring two such rulers as the Sultans of Mokalla and of Lahej in order the more readily to show our inclinations towards an Arab hegemony. The latter’s friendship is courted by both Idrisi and Imam while the former’s isolated position, in certain eventualities, offers him a possible inducement to intrigue against British rule with Arabs. I therefore strongly recommend the bestowal on them both of the Order of the Indian Empire, on the analogy of the treatment accorded to Persian Gulf Sheikhs, as Honorary Knight Com manders. “ Idrisi is a Maliki but now professes to be a Shafai Sunni, while the Imam and his tribesmen are Zeidi Shiahs.” Telegram R., dated Therapia, the 11th (received 12th) September 1914). From—His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. •o tel ® gra i m No ' 542 * Telegram from the Acting Consul-General, Baghdad, received on 9th September is much more reassuring. Vali has given him strong stand over (?) confidential assurances that whatever happens he wdl protect British subjects from injury. Acting Consul-General is convinced ol the sincerity of these assurances which are corroborated by similar guarantees from the chief religious dignitary of the Sunni persuasion. The Christian British community consists of 47 English-born men with six women and children, besides 24 native-born men with 76 women and children. Eesponsible English people do not want to leave though some younger English men wish to do so. Turkish steamers are now taking passengers. Popular tension is decreasing. Departure of women and children would create panic. In these circumstances, special reasons for asking Lynch to allow one more voyage have ceased to be cogent. On the other hand, I learn from the Ac mg Consul, Basrah, that their local Agent is hesitating on other grounds I have informed the Acting Consul, therefore, that Confederation had better await further instructions from Principals in London.

It is proposed by the Resident at Aden that, on the outbreak of hostilities, Camaran, the station now used for placing in quarantine all pilgrims proceeding from India to Jeddah should be seized by the British. If the adoption of this course of action is accepted, the Government of India should be ready to open a com plete quarantine siation at Camaran, because, if this were not done, the Tuiks would be placed in a position to resist the admission ot pilgrims to Jeddah, thus evading the condition regarding non-interference with pilgrim traffic whici is referred to in the telegram from the Government of India, dated the /tli September 1914.

I would find it of use if you could furnish me with a list of Turkish officials and other emissaries who have actually visited Egypt and India and who can be proved conclusively to have carried on anti-English^ propaganda amongst Moslems. X would also he glad to be kept from time to time informed of the latest additions to their number. For the present, I should not mention any names, but the list would at once become usef ul during conversations with Turkish statesmen, and, subsequently, a time might arrive at which it would be advantageous to communicate the names officially to the Turkish Govern ment and request them to disavow anti-English agitators of Turkish origin professing to address Egyptian and Indian Moslems in the Calif’s name. The moment to act would be when His Majesty’s Government considered the publication of an exchange of notes on the subject would create the best results in Egypt and India. Instead of any complete list of agitators generally, it would be more important to prepare for the purpose I have in view, a relatively short list of well authenticated instances of propaganda by Turks.

In continuation of my telegram No. S.-D. 1351 of to-day’s date, I am directed to enclose a note by Mr. S. M. Edwardes regarding Pir Sayad2 Ibrahim of Baghdad which gives full information on all the points alluded to in vour telegram No. 717 S., dated the 8 th September 1914. It is within the knowledge of Government that Mr. Edwardes correctly describes the attitude of the Pir towards the British Government. 2. It will be seen that if we could guarantee his position at Baghdad as against the Turkish Government, it is not improbable that he would become an active supporter of British proceedings. Enclosure. Copy of a note by S. M. Edwards, Esq., Commissioner of Police, Bombay, No. U.O.E. No. 3376 M.—40, dated the 11th September i014. The Pir Saheb of Baghdad has resided in Bombay for three years. He is at present a friend of mine and we have exchanged many visits. 1 am prepared to guarantee his good faith and iriendship. 2. The reasons for his leaving Baghdad are said to be one of the following:— (a) His uncle is at present on the Fir's gadi in Baghdad, and Sayad Ibrahim is the probable successor to the gadi. In consequence, there has been intrigues, culminating in a quarrel between him and his uncle, which has obliged Sayad Ibrahim to exile himself from Baghdad ; or— (b) Sayad Ibrahim is greatly revered by the Memons of Bombay, most of whom are his “ Mureeds ” or disciples. Eor some time before he actually came to India he had been pressed by the Chhotbani Jamat to come to Bombay and show himself. His uncle, the present Pir, was much averse to his coming to India; but as Sayad Ibrahim was of the contrary opinion, a quarrel took place between them and ftayad Ibrahim left without permission for India. In consequence, he does not care to return until his uncle’s wrath has cooled; or (c) In the time of Nazim Pasha, Turkish Governor of Baghdad, the family of the Pir had various prerogatives and rights which Nazim Pasha did his best to cut down and deprive them of. This policy was continued by Nazim Pasha’s successor; and Sayad Ibrahim led the movement against the Turkish Governor, which was designed to keep their privileges intact. In consequence, Sayad Ibrahim was practically forced into exile by the Turkish Government and cannot return for the present at any rate. 3 . Sayad Ibrahim’s attitude towards local politics and All-India Moslem affairs has been absolutely correct since his arrival. He has declined more than once to make any public pronouncement on any matters affecting the British Government and their Moslem subjects. But in private conversation he has been studiously pro^British and on the side of law and order. For example, he told a group of Memons and others one evening in his bungalow that nowhere in the world, and particularly in Turkish territory, was there such complete peace and good order as is to be found everywhere in British territory. 4 . He has more than once advised Musalmans to stick to the Commis sioner of Police and do all in their power to assist him; and I believe that he is sincerely grateful to me for the help which I gave him on his arrival three Years ago. 1 know Sayad Ibrahim very well and I am quite cenain that whatever happens he will do his best to meet my personal wishes and that I can count upon him to be friendly, even in the event of trouble with Turkey. In tne latter event hp would probably remain neutral—I doubt if he could ue used as an Agent by us ; for alter all his ultimate chance of succeeding to the pir ship of Baghdad rests largely with tne Turkish Government. He would probably preier a policy of aosolute and strict neutrality. But I think I can saiely say that he will never do anything winch would ue likely to embarrass us here.

Abovementioned troops have established posts of from 5 or 6 to 300 men all along frontier from latitude 37 northerly. I understand, in the event of outbreak of war, regiment(s) at Us(hnu) would retire, and that Kussian line of defence would be Maku, Khoi, Dilman with flank resting on Us(hnu) lake. Incident occurred three days ago on frontier near Maku. Russian detachment under command of officer on reconnaissance duty crossed frontier. Right with Turks ensued in which officer in question was wounded, and two or three were killed and wounded on each side. Russian military authorities take^serious view of Turkish mobilisation on frontier, but there are no indications of forward movement by Turks.

For date crop Company’s fast mail steamers will resume weekly call at Basrah as soon as possible and they are now sending large cargo steamer to Basrah.

Fire-work display is going on throughout Germany in token of their pleasure at their victory at Manois. Thousands of Berlin citizens collected together and gave an enthusiastic ovation to the Empress while she was paying a visit to Crown Princess. Russia invited the people of Norrodotto to enlist themselves, but ninety per cent, of the people have refused to do so. The Belgian Army has encamped at Antwerp (Ansi).

He adds that he is in a position to state overtures through reliable media. ^ It is also probable that we could influence the Sharif of Mecca in the same direction through the medium of Bin Saud. As far as practically possible, the ports of the Red Sea used by Imam and Idrisi might be exempted from hostile action. “ We should, on the outbreak of war, at once seize and hold Sheikh Said opposite Perim, and Fao Telegraph office. “As you are aware the religion of the tribes of Central Arabia is Sunni while the chief tribe of the Tigris Valley and about a moiety of the population of Basrah is Shiah. Apart from any question of Jehad, we do not think the Mahoraedan community in India of either persuasion would be much concerned at the mere recrudescence of rebellion by the Arabs of Arabia against the lurk. It may be presumed that the educated classes would view such disaffec tion with regret, but I doubt whether there would be active resentment. “ from Egypt against the Hejaz Railway of course suggests itself but that quarter seems beyond the scope of your telegram under reply.” Secondly. Lines of your proposed communication to Gulf Chiefs are generally approved by Government of India, but opening portion mMit be amplified from the text of the following communique, which, in event of declaration of war being imminent, it is proposed to issue here and in Tehran If the contingency arises, you can make this known Iccally and embody so much of it in your letters to individual Chiefs as is likely to be comprehended by them. Communique referred to above is as follows :— “ Attitude adopted by the Turkish Government in regard to German ihen-of-war, Goehen and Breslau, has aroused great misgivings in London Pans and St. Petersburgh. These ships were flying from French and British fleets m Mediterranean and took reluge in Dardanelles, where, by rules of international iaw and under Turkish Treaties, they should have been laid un by I urkish Government and their crews repatriated until the close of the w^fr or made to leave for open sea at the end of 24 hours. “ Instead of this the ships were allowed to remain in shelter and to exercGo belligerent rights on a French ship, and then it was suddenly announced that tney had been purchased by Turkey who retained German crews and dismissed British Admiral from his executive command of Turkish fleet. ? At the same time the passage of the Dardanelles was sown with mines and ail British merchant vessels in those waters or coming through from Black S * were held up; first, on pretext that their cargoes were wanted for troops whom turkey was mobilising, and then that presence of mines rendered it unsafe tm- vessels to proceed. This was not only a totally unjustifiable interference on the part of a neutral State with trade of Great Britain involving both shippers and merchants in heavy loss, but it paralysed movements of all British snipping in Black Sea amounting at the time to 60 or 70 vessels, since not only wa? it impossible to get thiough into the Mediterranean, but there was nothin- to prevent Goehen and Breslau passing into Black Sea and destroying alf the shipping collected there. J ° eu Further 1 , while the wireless telegraphy installations of French and British {ships in Straits were dismantled by orders of the Turkish Government, a German merchant vessel, the Lily llickmers, was allowed to retain and use her apparatus, and was afterwards transferred to the Turkish Flag—a proceeding which the Turkish Government themselves admit to be wholly illegal. “ Another reason for grave disquietude has been the unfriendly treatment by responsible Turkish officials in Baghdad and Mesopotamia of British subjects and open incitement of the population by Turkish official circles against Great Britain and her allies. “ Notwithstanding all this provocation, His Majesty’s Government have not only intimated that, if Turkish are substituted for German crews on Goeben and Breslau, if British merchant shipping is not impeded, and if Turkey will honourably carry out duties of a neutral State, not only would all these illegalities and hostile acts be overlooked, but that a solemn and written guarantee would be given that Great Britain will scrupulously respect independence and integrity of the Ottoman Empire. “ Furthermore, assurances were given that, at the conclusion of peace, Great Britain would see that no conditions were laid down which would impair that independence and integrity, and that economic conditions of a character favourable to Turkey would be obtained. “ Great Britain, the greatest Mahomedan Power in the world and faithful and consistent friend of Turkey whom she has steadfastly helped to maintain her position in Europe and to recover stability shaken in Balkan wars, would see with greatest regret that Turkey had been decoyed into ranging herself on side of England’s enemies and adopting an attitude as unjustified as it would he ungrateful, hut it cannot be denied that present situation shows that there is a chauvinistic element endeavouring to drive Turkey into war with England for benefit of Germany and of Austria, the secular enemy of Turkish State.” No communications will, of course, be issued by you until such time as specific instructions from Government of India are received by you to do so. Telegram, P., dated Therapia, the 6th (received 7th) September 1914. p rom —His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad has asked me to transmit to Government of India the following telegram, dated 5th September :— Begins. From Constantinople final orders have been received permitting the military authorities to take in a few days my Dragoman and Kavases as soldiers. Are the Government of India prepared to sanction my paying the native agent’s exemption tax which amounts to £T 43 ? This man’s services are, both at present and in more serious eventualities, invaluable and almost indispensable to Residency. Six out of nine Muhammadan Kavases will be taken. Of these only one is qualified to pay exemption tax. m Telegram P., dated Therapia, the 6th (received 7th) September 1914. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, To The Foreign Office, London (repeated to Government of India). The Aetinsr British Consul-General, Baghdad, is much perturbed about the safety in the event of war with Turkey, of British subjects there. Only British vessel’at present available there besides “ Comet ” is launch “ Ishtar ” winch belongs to Lynch. It is impossible for women and children to leave gradually and they cannot go unprotected via Persia. English community could be sheltered temporarily in Consulate if danger arose, but should they have to4 leave Baghdad the only means would be for them to go abroad in a Lyneh steamer. Major Scott leaves me to judge whether to have such a steamer sent immediately from Karim is desirable in the present situation. What Turkish attitude would be in the event of war he does not know, but he is afraid that authorities might not allow British subjects to leave Basrah. He suggests that if British subjects were left in their homes United States Consul miglit reside in our Residency and they could seek shelter there in case of danger. Owdng to conflicting influences at work, he cannot pronounce as to what local feeling w’ould he. The Military authorities are sending as fast as steamer facilities wall allow troops to Basrah. Up to 1 st September 2,000 had left, and 6,000 more were to follow. Germans are exerting very bitter and anglophobe influence, according to Major Scott. The fate of Indian Guard rifles and “ Comet ” in the event of war is also exercising Acting Consul-General. He asks whether Government of India would like it to leave at once for Karim with women and children and whether they would approve in last resort making engines unserviceable or dismantlino- guns. Further, Major Scott also asks whether he may send 5 ‘ Ishtar ,, with mails to Basrah to catch the outward post from there or whether he had better retain her at Baghdad.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador, Constantinople, To—His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad (repeated to Foreign Office London, and Government of India). With reference to my immediately preceding telegram, I have sent following to 11 is Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad, No. 27 . Reference your telegram, dated 1 st September. Summary of your telegram has been telegraphed by me to Foreign Office and Government of India and I aw^ait instructions from them as regards “ Comet ” and Indian Guard. In icgard to British subjects, the outbreak of war w r ould not necessarily involve their immediate departure. Arrangements would have to be made in due course if Turkish Government decided to expel them. Question for immediate decision is whether apprehension need be entertained for their safety either in present circumstances or in the event of war. From here I cannot estimate danger of popular outbreak. Kindly let me know the number of English w-omen and children who have to be considered. Other British subjects would, I presume, run infinite ly less risk. You had better, I think, detain “ Ishtar ” in the meantime. Are English people at present themselves anxious to leave ? The situation here has improved. Telegram P,, No. S. 705, dated the 7th September 1914.

After compliments .—I have received with the hand of friendship and gratification your friendly letter, dated the 29th of Ramzan 1332 PL, 21st August 1914, and thank you very sincerely for the expressions of loyalty and offers of assistance which it contains. I have not failed to convey them immediately to my Government. It is indeed gratifying to see how, in this time of stress, the whole Empire, North, South, East and West, holds together as one man. I was indeed glad to hear of your safe arrival in our country. I trust that your Id was auspicious. You enquire about the slow mail steamers. It may be that owing to the needs of Government they will not be able to call quite so frequently as formerly for a few weeks, but every effort will be made to send as many as possible so as to fulfill the needs of merchants, and you may rest assured that your port of Kuwait will receive its full measure of attention with all other ports of the Persian Gulf. And with regard to the matter of your ships which carry dates to India, the regular official instructions are either on their way or should have reached you before you receive this letter. I see no reason to interrupt their sailings only they should be careful not to approach the ports of Bombay and Karachi except in the hours of daylight. “• Usual ending.Enclosure No. 111. MEMORANDUM. I interviewed Sir Mubarak yesterday on the subject of Foreign Depart ment telegram No. 594 S , dated 19th August. He says that he is with us, he and his men, ships, and all that he has, that he will be victorious with us, be defeated with us, or perish with us, as the ease may be. Nothing could be stronger than his expressions of loyalty. In regard to Um Qasr, Safwan and Bubian, he remarked that, though he is at any time prepared to accept any arrangement Government may make concerning these places, they really belong to him, and he would be very glad to recover them from the Turks. He is of opinion that there would be no difficulty in capturing the posts the garrisons would be replaced by his men y and he considers it most unlikely that any attempt to retake them would be made by Turkey. • . c* i Sir Mubarak says that Bin Saud will act as recommended by him, and after some discussion we came to the conclusion that the best course would be to send a messenger to Bin Saud at once on the outbreak of war with letters from the Sheikh and from me assuring him of deliverance from Turkish rule- for the future. He would then shake off Turkish suzerainty and act as we might direct. I think this is all that can be done from here. Sir Mubarak says that Basrah would gladly open its doors to a British occupation, and that the Arab population will rise against the local Govern ment on the first sign of hostile action on the part of Great Britain.

With reference to this last, I propose adding after the words “this oppressor of Moslems who calls himself their protector”, the following passage “as if Moslems needed a protector other than Allah”. In my opinion this addition will appeal to Wahibi element in Persian Gulf and Nejd. In Gulf itself Wahibism is only dormant.

This question is now more or less academic, as negotiations on which we had entered broke down owing to our refusal to accept time limit for negotiation of a system to take place of judicial Capitulations. Had we been able to come to an agreement ad referendum, without sacntice^ ot real interests, Triple Entente would have gained ground, but ^they have lost nothing by showing willingness to negotiate on reasonable grounds. To have closed the door on Halil’s advances would have driven lurks to conclude that there was nothing to oe hoped for from Triple Entente. My view was on the whole favourable to conceding a longtime limit for negotiation of commercial treaty if we could have 1 here by saved judicial Capitulations, wdthout which or similar safeguards it is doubtful m long run wdiether foreigners will be able to continue to live in this countiy. ^ My reason was that shall we have probably so many means of putting pressure on Turkey at the end of the war that negotiation of commercial treaty would present lesser difficulties than in norma] times. This question is, however, not of impoitance at present for reasons which I have given. With regard to the last paragraph of your telegram, I rather gather that there is some doubt in your mind lest conciliatory attitude on our part should encourage Turkish Government further to disregard our rights^ and their obligations. _ 1 do not think that this apprehension is well founded. Turkish Government to-day is m ettect a military dictatorship inspired and supported by Germany. Grand A izier and others are, I think, undoubtedly exercising as great influence as they are able, motives o which I need not go into. . „ , . _ But extreme party see in European struggles an opportunity of freeing them selves from all international trammels, and I am absolutely convinced that nothing wu stop them, as they have acquiescence, if not backing, of Germany and 1 ustna. Our main object being to postpone hostilities with this country m the hope o averting them altogether, we have followed only course compatible with that intention—namely, acceptance under protest and under reservation of our rights o certain measures which Turkish Government have adopted at variance with thei &amp; It is not the course which would recommend itself under normal circumstances, but if it preserves peace until a more favourable [ group omitted : moment] comes tor asserting our rights, and thereby defeats one of mam objects of German policy, it is worth pursuing to the end. , -u It has been successful now for nine weeks, and every week that we can ho on makes our chance of success greater. n . y.

If our right is clear and we are prepared to run the risk ot hostilities at this moment with probability of involving our allies it is another matter, but un e there are imperative reasons for keeping our ships at Mohammerah at this moment, might it not be more prudent to avoid possibility of attempt to intern them .

Receipt of Turkish note changes situation as far as the suggestion contained in last paragraph of my telegram No. 957 of 11th October was concerned, as we cohid not now leave Mohammerah without loss of prestige. 1 admit also that, once sent to Mohammerah, effect of moving our men-of-war at the request of the Turkish Government might have been misinterpreted by Arabs. Although I do not think it altogether unlikely that they might close the channel and thus prevent His Majesty’s ships from coming out unless some agreement be arrived at, I would not regard the note in the light of an ultimatum. There is general consensus of opinion that the Turks are resisting German pressure which is now being strongly applied to take part in the war. Minister of War is said to be in favour of immediate co-operation, and my anxiety is lest the resistance which he is encountering from the Moderates should be weakened by any act on our part which could be interpreted by Turks as aggressive. I think that the Grand Vizier’s assurances that the Turkish Government will not attack us have a certain weight and are entitled to credence in spite of all the preparations which are being made; but the closing of the Shatt-el-Arab, which is supposed to be a German objective, might not be regarded as anything more than a precautionary measure, like the closing of the Dardanelles. The next move would be for His Majesty’s Government to make. Ihe Turkish note is not well put, and should not be difficult to answer.

As to the passage to and from the port of Mohammerah through the Shatt-el-Arab, His Majesty’s Government while maintaining the principle that such passage is legiti mate, would be quite willing to examine in a friendly spirit any representation from the Ottoman Government provided that the Sublime Porte will themselves faithfully fulfil the duties 01 a neutral Power.

I his is in addition to a sum of Rs. 40,000 given to Saiyid Talib in Kuwait. Presumably these sums were paid for Saiyid Talib’s assistance in the nego tiations with the Turks. The execution of the Qatif merchant, Abdul Hussain bin Juma, has already been reported in my summary for the month of July. Dr. Harrison who has only just returned from A1 Qatif confirms the account that Abdul Hussain s letters to the Turkish authorities were sent to Bin Saud by Said Talib. It is perhaps needless to say that Dr. Harrison’s visit to A1 Qatif was in no way encouraged by the Political Agent, Bahrain, who does not appear to have been consulted. Dr. Harrison, according to his own account, was very well received. He is enthusiastic about the improvements already effected in Qatit by the Amir’s officials.

We were instructed in Marine Department telegram of iSth instant, No. H. 309, to warn all British vessels to avoid Turkish waters and ports, on which all pilgrim ships in or approaching Turkish Red Sea Ports were withdrawn to Berim, Aden or Port Soudan. We were instructed in the telegram, No. j. 791 W., of 20th instant, from the Chief of the General Staff, Simla, to the General Officer Commanding, Bombay Brigade, to advise the Port Officer that pilgrim ships need not be detained. Pilgrim ships are conse quently being despatched from the Port of Bombay. During the next fort night large numbers of pilgrims are due to leave Bombay. I asked Chief of the General Staff, Simla, in my telegram of 22nd instant, whether pilgrim ships which have been withdrawn to British Ports might proceed to Red Sea Turkish Ports. In reply the Chief of the General Staff intimated in his tele gram, No. 2001 W., that in accordance with the instructions referred to above, Britis*h ships in the Red Sea should not be permitted to proceed to Turkish Ports or waters. Also that the relaxation permitted at Bombay was made on account of fear of outbreak of cholera if pilgrims collected in large numbers at Bombay. The result of these instructions is that there are 2,000 pilgrims on board ships at Aden, and 1,000 pilgrims at Kamaran long overdue to proceed to Jeddah and the former are becoming turbulent. Since provisions are provided from ships and only five days’ supplies was take nj it is doubtful whether they have food. Large number of pilgrims will sail from Bombay during next fortnight and onward. There is however no reason able Guarantee that the pilgrims will be permitted to proceed to port of desti nation. Pilgrims in Hedjaz are fed from supplies sent with pilgrim ships to Jeddah. Consequently there is danger of scarcity if further supplies are not sent. In addition there is a possible danger of outbreak of disease amongst the pilorims on detained ships. The position is therefore unsatisfactory. It is therefore proposed (a) that the pilgrim ships permitted to leave Bombay should be allowed to proceed to Jeddah ; (b) that ships now detainedew route to Jeddah should be allowed to proceed; and (c) that every endeavour should be made to stay influx of pilgrims to Bombay. It is of great political importance for British prestige that pilgrim traffic should not be discontinued. I am to enquire, therefore, whether the Government of India would be prepared to guarantee SO per cent, of bottom in case of capture and condemnation as prize of British pilgrim ships ? It is possible, even if endeavour be made to stay influx of pilgrims to Bombay, that large numbers will arrive at the port and grave discoiTtent would be caused if they were made to return.

There appears to he no objection to allowing ships to enter Turkish waters at owners risk, since British ships have merely been warned (not) to enter such waters and more especially as Hodeidah is dependent on Aden largely for her food supplies.

Turner Morison on the ■subject.I Dated Bombay, the 25th August 1914 From— Messes. Turner Moeison &amp; Co., Ltd., To The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. As Managing Agents of the Bombay and Persia S. N. Co, Ltd., and the Arab Steamers Limited, we have the honour to bring to the notice of Government the great inconvenience, hardship and losses suffered not only by the Companies we represent but also by shippers of cargo to Aden and Bed Sea ports and pilgrims proceeding to Jeddah by several of these Companies, steamers being compelled to leave Turkish ports and held up at Aden and other ports. The “ Homayun ” arrived at Jeddah on the 17th with pilgrims on hoard and about 12,791 packages to discharge, but after she had discharged about 3,000 packages she was directed to leave that port immediately for Port Sudan where she had no cargo or passengers to discharge or receive. Similarly the &lt;5 Jslami **, which had just completed her five days’ quarantine at Camaran and was about’to proceed to Jeddah, and the steamer “ Jeddah”, whose pilgrims were doin' quarantine at Camaran, were directed to proceed immediately back to Aden. °The “ Islami ” has been hung up at Aden and the “ Jeddah” at Perim since the 21 st instafat. The pilgrims of the latter steamer are reported to have mutinied at Camaran owing to the steamer having left that port without taking aboard the pilgrims. The “ Khosrou ” which was on her way from here to Jeddah with pilgrims and caro-o for Aden, Hodeidah, Jeddah and Port Sudan and pilgrims has been hung up at Aden since the 19th instant by the order of the British Political Kesident there. The “ Homayun ” has been ordered to proceed back to Jeddah from Port Sudan to discharge the balance of cargo for that port. The detention of these steamers at Port Sudan and Aden and the heavy extra expenses incurred in consequence of their having to go back fiom Camaran to Aden instead of proceeding on their voyage, added to the extra- ordinarily heavy price of coal at Aden, have involved the Companies above- named in serious losses, not to speak of the hardship and losses suffered by the shippers of cargo by these boats and the inconvenience and hardship felt by the pilgrims on board the “Islami” and “Khosrou” and the pilgrims of the “ Jeddah ” still left at Camaran. Every day’s further detention accentuates the losses, inconvenience and hardship already entailed on the several parties above named and, unless the vessels held up are permitted to proceed on their voyage wdthout further delay, the position promises to be more serious for all concerned. We, therefore, respectfully pray that Government may be pleased to take immediate effective measures to ease the present situation. /# Telegram P., dated the 28th (received 29th) August 1914.

There is a report, to which credence may be attached, that 2,000 Turkish soldiers have arrived at Basrah to-day from Baghdad. This news has dis tinctly perturbed the Sheikh of Mohammerah and he is in conjunction with Riparian owners clamouring for ships to transport his date crops. Lyle has telegraphed reminder to Bombay regarding despatch of steamers to Moham merah. He says, however, that the risk mentioned in our telegram No. 642 S. of 27th instant cannot be accepted by the local agent. I consider the risk involved to be small and it is, in my opinion, important to reassure our friend here by sending the ships. I should be glad if British India Steam Navigation Company’s head office at Calcutta could send instructions to their local agent at Bushire, by telegraph, to accept the risk involved. I am of the opinion that the despatch of steamers to Mohammerah might relieve the situation at Basrah, which has, from reports received from the Consul, been easier of late. A forecast of the effect of despatch of the 2,000 Turkish troops in question is at present impossible. Addressed Poreign and repeated Admiral.

I have received no official intimation as yet to concur in despatch to Basrah but I have recommended her proceed to Mohammerah accepting slight risk involved. As regards Basrah, I would recommend that matter should be decided by Consul, Basrah, as I gather Yali’s attitude was very correct. Customs and town feeling generally was unsatisfactory and general impression there amongst Europeans was that it would do Turks and especially Arab date garden owners no harm to realise what interruption of fiiendly relations with us letting alone war would mean to them. Germans were being given, it was reported, customs facilities and their clerks were being left untouched while our merchant offices were being harassed. Recommend Consul should not remove ban until satisfied that all nationalities are being treated with scrupulous impartiality and should not hesitate to let Turks and others know that these are his instructions.

To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. We have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your telephone message of this date from which we note that if we are willing to let our steamers proceed to Jeddah, there is no objection to their doing so. In a previous communication, we have pointed out to you the very heavy losses we have incurred and are incurring by the delay, and we have also referred to the trouble we are experiencing with pilgrims owing to the voyage to Jeddah being held up. In the case of one steamer at any rate, a mutiny has taken place and we fear considerable further trouble might arise in the event of further detention. On this account we have, as a matter of urgency, cabled to our steamers to proceed on their voyages, but we must earnestlyrequest you to place our position immediately before the Govornment of India with an urgent request that they will be good enough to carry on behalf of Government 80 per cent of the war risk on pilgrim steamers. We may say that we have already applied to place our steamers under the Government scheme in England, but have been advised that it is not possible to include them owing to the prohibition of Turkish ports. In the interests of the pilgrims, and to prevent the consequence of a panic spreading to the Muhammadans of this country, we have, as stated herein, instructed our steamers to proceed, but we trust before they reach Turkish waters, 2 or 3 days hence, Government would be pleased to accept our proposal to carry the war risk and relieve us to the extent stated.Confidential A Mi iovfip ami political Hfitavtmtnt, Simla, the 3rd September Ml 4 Put *way wiaOlilgj &lt;'&lt;i: Vv cA fc-k M A* I am desired to forward herewith, for information, ✓r. a report by Lieutenant N.

From—The Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, Baghdad, v To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. I have despatched the following telegram to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople and repeated to Basrah :—“ Political situation at Baghdad. Since the outbreak of war a week ago the Baghdad Army Corps has begun mobilisation. This was commenced by the posting of placards on the walls calling reservists up to the 45th year to military duty. Simul taneously the War Office refused to accept any cypher telegrams between Consuls and their Embassies. Only Brench and Turkish messages were received after having been censored. A considerable degree of resentment against this mobilisation exists among the population. Official Turkish circles are openly pro-German and they are striving to utilise this resentment to excite the population against England and Bussia. “ The normal population of Mesopotamia is, however, very pro-English. “ The placarding and distribution of a really dangerous appeal to Moslems, written by Djavid Pasha, as Inspector of the Eourth Inspectorate to himself as Yali, inviting Moslems, inter alia&gt; to unite against these Powers, who in every instance are devoid of all pity towards Muhammadans, was fortunately just prevented in time by my Russian and Erench colleagues and myself. &lt;« That an abnormal condition exists in town has not been intimated to any Consulate, yet a state of sffie is in force and martial law has been proclaimed. «« The rights of domicile of British subjects have been violated since the military authorities entered the garden and stable of a British subject and seized his horses. “ As already reported by me on the 8th August, the military authorities had seized mules, horses and even cloth belonging to British subjects all over the Vilayet. In every case they have done so without payment and in the majority of instances without the grant of a receipt. This Consulate-General had no knowledge of all these personal acts. A protest has now been made by me, both verbally and in writing, claiming that as this Consulate General is officially ignorant of the existence of any unusual conditions at Baghdad and has not been asked to assist at requisitions, pending the receipt of instructions from Your Excellency, I hold the Yali responsible for all losses and claims for damages. “ The Turkish Government hope to raise 80,000 men at Basrah and Baghdad and another 80,000 at Musal (Mosul?;. This, however, is very doubtful. It is said that troops are to be divided between Eryinjam, Basrah and Khamkm. I learn secretly that, excited by German intrigues, Turkish ambitions hope for a rising of the Moslems in Egypt, India and tbe Caucasus. “ The reservists are sorry immigrants lacking clothing, shoes and food. It will take more than a week yet for the mobilization of the first battalion to be completed. No cypher telegrams are being accepted here in spite of Your Excellency’s representations. This telegram has been sent from Baghdad on the 9th August by secret messenger to Kermanskah. “ Postscript. 11 P. M., 10th August 1914. Yali has now announced that cypher messages will be accepted. The stables of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were entered by the Police this evening, who seized 76 mules m spite of the written protest which I made yesterday. No receipt has been given for the mules taken. “The Manager of a British firm was also called upon by the Police to-day at his private residence and was requested by them to appear at the police station with the keys of all his warehouses. Be refused their request and, having sealed his warehouse, sent his keys to me for custody. “ If Your Excellency could persuade Porte to insist on local authorities adoptin 0 * genuine neutral attitude, the situation here would immediately improve. Although there is a certain amount of cursing by population \J\ &lt;L L [ tP.') Sit t. t' l o f ~ -i w3«UBfeR.VM&gt;ii \ |« - against English and Russians the populace at present is not out of hand If, however, agitation is encouraged secretly by the oeal Government authorities, trouble mi-ht easily and quickly develop as people are exasperated at mobi- iLation more so 'as interfering with the Ramazan observances.

Thereafter, I would proceed to Bahrain and the Trucial Coast for about two weeks. I consider it of importance that the situation up river should be examined, as the people of Abadan are nervous and have asked for a man-of-war to be sent there. Except occasionally, I shall be out of telegraphic touch during the last fortnight. In view of the present situation, I venture to ask the permission of the Government of India before undertaking the projected tour. I wish to try to take (in) the situation at the pearling ports this cold weather in time, as I fear acute distress will prevail at these ports. 7 Telegram P., No. 582 dated the 18th August 1914, From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, To—The Naval Commander-in-Chief, H.

I have received a private letter from Bullard, the Consul at Basrah, dated 15th August, to the effect that emissaries may go from there to try and stir up disaffection in India. Turks, in fact all Moslems, are displaying a very anti-British attitude. Consul is not able to telegraph to places outside Turkey in code. Bullard’s letter concludes—I am doing my utmost to get message from London in connection with warning to British vessels not to enter Turkish waters through to Basrah and Mohammerah. I presume Steamship Companies, plying between India and Persian Gulf, have received warning. A® if important factor in present situation to endeavour to effect the ^ establishment of communicatien with Mohammerah, do you see any objection to my attempting to send Mohammerah and Basrah mails up Bahmashir m launches belonging to Anglo-Persian Oil Company.

I have received the following unnumbered telegram, hearing to-day’s date, from the Political Agent at Mohammerah:— “ Please refer to your telegrams, Nos. 975 and 976, dated the 18th August 1914. In my opinion the chief danger to Abadan lies in the possibility of the “ Marmaris ” firing shells into the oil storage tank and thus des troying most of the works by fire without danger or difficulty. With this cannonading the Infantry detachment could not do so much to prevent this. Por the protection of property at Abadan, therefore, it seems to me that a British gunboat is essential point in any measure adopted. At the present moment the “ Marmaris ” is at Basrah. The presence of troops in the Sheikh’s district will certainly he objected to by him, as he is of opinion that the other Sheikhs and headmen will accuse him of handing over Government and power to the British and giving away the country, &amp;c. These objections can probably be overcome; but the Persian Government will possibly blame him if he acquiesces in our plans.

In compliance with this instruction four steamers and two lighter steamers left. The former on being advised by me to quit Shatt-el-Arab have gone down the river this morning to Bushire.

We should be in a very favourable position and absolutely secure of loyalty of Mohammerah and Noweit with “ Odin opposite Failiyah, the Sheikh s palace, or between that place and Mohammerah, troops in Abadan and another ship seizing telegraph station at Fao and bombarding Fao port. As regards the more ambitious project of seizing Basrah, it appears to me that we would require a far greater force than we have at present, as, though Turks need not be considered as really formidable, there remains the Arab looters, who will present a difiicult problem, likely to take form at any moment. I therefore suggest, with all deference, that the miserable garrisons in^ Gulf littoral for the present be neglected. Mob would on their own initiative no doubt turn out the Turks at British and other places. It is doubtful, however, if assistance will be forthcoming from the Katar Chiefs in those parts.

From—The Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. In this part of Arabia there are three rivals— (a) Imam, (b) Turks,, (c) Idrisi. The Turks have up to the present been unsuccessful in their attempts to conciliate the Idrisi, and his ports of Meidi and Djezan are in consequence now being blockaded by them. If Imam and Idrisi, who are at present fighting with one another, should make a pact which, at this juncture, is problematical owing to these two parties being mutual rivals, then Turks and Idrisi might follow suit; but, on the other hand if Turks and Idrisi are first reconciled to one another, then Imam, influenced by jealousy of his adversary and rival, is likely to break his existing pact with the Turks, while the Idrisi would, in all probability, join issues with the Turks. The Turks and Imam are at present outwardly friendly, the reason for this is because the Imam enjoys a large subsidy from the Ottoman Govern ment, while the weakness of the Turks after the war in the Balkans makes it politic for them to court Imam’s good graces in Arabia. If Porte show s a hostile front to His Majesty’s Government, it would he possible to encourage Imam to revoke his pact with the Turkish Government by promising him monetary help and the outcome would he an Arabic coalition between Idrisi and Imam directed against the Turks whose system of Govern ment and malpractices are repugnant to all Arabs. Attitude of Imam towards ourselves is of a friendly character, and attitude of Idrisi is expectant. Thus, without it being necessary for us to take any hostile steps on land, which would only tend to create a suspicious atmosphere in our protectorate, we could cause the position of Turkish Government to become untenable in South-West Arabia. Bombardment of sea ports belonging to Turkey in the Red Sea might be auxiliary measure, while Idrisi ports would remain untouched. I venture to make these suggestionshaving some experience of these places. Many Arab tribes inside the Turkish border have, for years past, sought protection of British* Government, and our good name and reputation for straight dealings are household words. Since the above was written, I have received cypher telegram from Bombay Government of 19th instant, forwarding questions with Government of India, No. 595 S.,* of • senai No. 29 . same date. These leave me in position to add that I can at once start overtures from here to Imam through reliable mediums. Regarding those Indian Moslems who are in Aden, they would be passive onlookers should a rupture between Turks and Arabs ensue. I may mention that Sherif of Mecca at the present time adopts a very suspicious attitude towards Turks and has withdrawn to the seclusion of the hills.

A reference is invited to my telegram,§ dated the 14th August, repeating a telegram received from the § Scrial No ' 8 * Political llesident in the Persian Gull, in which the Resident reported the suspicious attitude of a Turkish gunboat at Basrah.The Political Resident at Bushire telegraphed to the Government of India on the 16th instant that the Oil Company’s settlement at Abadan was nervous of being attacked by the Turks, and asked for the protection of a British warship. It appeared possible that, in view of the expected outbreak of hostilities with Turkey, the Turkish gunboat might suddenly proceed Abadan and shell the oil reservoirs there. As we regarded the situation as requiring precautionary measures, we were about to send either the R.I.M.S. “Lawrence” or H.M.S. “Odin” with 100 sepoys from the garrison at Bushire for the protection of the oil settlement. Having regard, however, to the acute anti-British attitude of the Turks in the Shatt-el-Arab, the local officers are of opinion that the despatch of a gunboat will be attended with some risk, and the despatch of sepoys with great risk, of precipitating a collision with the Turks. The matter, meanwhile, is giving a less urgent aspect in view of the slightly improved attitude of the Porte as reported to me yesterday and affords an opportunity for a reference to be made to you before action is taken by us. The suggestion that the location of British sepoys at Abadan may irritate the Turks and will be a matter of some inconvenience to the Sheikh of Moham- merah is, no doubt, not without force. In any case we would be disposed to send only as many men as H.M.S. “ Odin” could accommodate and keep them on board; but the comparative importance of the possible damage which may be done to numerous oil reservoirs and the alternative danger of precipitating a collision with the Turks by the adoption of the above measures for the preserv ation of the tanks is a question which we leave to the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. Our own feeling is that it is of the highest importance that in the event of war hostile action should be first taken by Turkey even if this step were to entail on us some military disadvantage or loss. It is requested that immediate instructions may be sent to us. There are only^ two Govern ment vessels now in the Persian Gulf, viz , the “ Lawrence ”, which will reach Bushire on Friday and the “ Odin,” which will arrive there on Saturday; both from the south.

Please refer to your telegram* No. 594 of the 19th instant. If war ultimately ensues out * serial No. 28 . between Turkey and ourselves, I am of opinion that rre shall be in position with a few and unimportant exceptions to depend on lovaltv of Persian Gulf Chiefs. Mohammerah and Koweit, I am inclined to think, will be entirely for us and if assurances were given to Bin Sand he would be the same. Bahrein is, I think, helpless for good or harm and I have no reason for anticipating anything more than local disturbances there owing to scarcity and high prices. This difficulty may arise in minor degree in all the other pearling ports of the Gulf. Maskat should be m position to stand fast with help of British troops which are now stationed there and 1 see no possibility of Sultan of Maskat taking side of Turks; Maskat rebels will only concern themselves with local politics. From Maskat to Dhofar there are no important British interests which are threatened neither (by r) lurkey nor (or ?) Germany. Coming to Persian side I think that we need feel little anxiety as regards coast from Bunder Abbas to Gwadur. Baluchis are not illdiposed ana the few telegraph offices we possess do not offer much attraction to marauders. I have talked with Governor of Gulf Ports as regards the question of Bushire and the Persian Gulf ports. Although people of town are unhesitatingly anti- Bussian and therefore Germanophile, I have not observed apy indication an have not received reports so far of active Anglophobe attitude except from Mesopotamia. ^ . As regards portion within my sphere, it appears a very simple thing o arouse an Arab attack at Basrah and stir up tribes on bank of the river Ticrris, hut it is not unlikely in that event that British and indeed all civilised interests will suffer equally and no substantial effect on the war would be prpduced by the detention for purposes of local defence of the indiffer ffiilifary force that the Porte are now employed in raising and which they contemplate despatching to Constantinople according to reports received y me. There is in fact every likelihood of a rising on part of Arabs without any of our intervention and the safety of the European inhabitants at Basrad and Baghdad must be a question of the gravest concern. The Bakhtinatribesmen may bold up tbe Abwaz-Tspaban road, but I am informed that they ure of no use for rendering help, nor are they a source of great danger for that matter. Personally I anticipate that there -will be ^ troubles in Central Persia but not at present nor until such time as financial scarcity occurs in ^ Tehran and impossibility of sending help to the provinces has time to make itself felt. In regard to measures other than those of a political character, the answer depends on whether any forces besides those at present moment stationed in Gulf can be despatched here and placed at our disposal. In my telegram to the Naval Commander-in-Chief I have indicated immediate plans which I consider advisable, but H.M.S. “Odin” cannot be at Eao and Pailiyah at the same time. I learn now that R.IM.S. “ Lawrence ” is quite capable of engaging Turkish gunboat “ Marmaris” and in that event she might take on the Failiyah duty leaving “Odin” at liberty to safeguard Fao and render help to “Lawrence” if this necessity appears. But the important blow to Turkish reputation would be the capture of Basrah. Can the Government of India spnre us the requii^ed force for this object ? Preli minary plan f&lt; r attack on Basrah would be the recall of all Europeans from Basrah and Baghdad and I am of opinion that withdrawal from Baghdad should take place without delay. The seiiure of Basrah would be the sign for a general insurrection along the river Tigris and also for an attack on Baghdad and for the probable capture by the Kurds of Aleppo and the demolition of Baghdad Railway. This in addition to diversions created by Eg\pt in Syria and the Hedjaz would certainly have a demoralising effect on mobilisation by Turkey and would wreck her Empire. following is the text of a general circular letter which I would suggest should be addressed to influential Persian Gulf Chiefs in the event of the out break of hostilities i—Begins. After usual compliments—The Government of Turkey has, by a number of acts directed against peaceful traders, subjects of the British Government, involved herself in war with England, France and Russia It has since Crimea war, when Great Britain and France voluntarily onoage’d in war to maintain integrity of Turkish Empire, been one of the principle objects of English Government to preserve inviolate the Empire of Turkey. Now present rulers of Turkey have by their spontaneous action in foolishly joining in a war waged between German nation and certain other nations paved the way for their own downfall and it seems impossible to hope that Turkish Empire can any longer be preserved. It is therefore incumbent on the independent peoples of Arabia to consider their position towards oppressor of Moslems who styles himself their protector. As regards the attitude of those Sheikhs whose territories are situated near to Turkey and who have seen and experienced instances of oppression at her hands, there is no reason for doubt whatever. These Sheikhs have for a long time been in opposition to Turkey and have been attempting to obiain their emancipation. Some have actually effected this and the others are now in open state of insurrec tion against the Turkish Government. The Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf are veil aware that His Majesty’s Government have never interfered with religious observances of Moslems nor shown hostile attitude to them but has without -exception always worked for the preservation of good order and peace every where and for amicable dealings with all her neighbours. Opportunities have frequentlv occurred for the acquisition of territory and temptation of this kind has always been resisted. Your relations with His Majesty’s Government have subsisted for many years past and I take this opportunity to impress on you that in this war we shall do our best to preserve to you, your religion and liberty. Nothing shall be done on our side to threaten either of these which are dearer to all people than life itself. Unfortunately German arrogance and Turkish folly have involved whole of Europe in scarcity and trouble. All that is necessary to be done by you is that you will maintain order and discipline in your respective dominions. Ho not permit foolish people amongst your subjects, who cannot realise how long by the beneficent protection of His Majesty’s Government they have been saved from the hand of the tyrant, to L co jmit any act to disturb the peace in your dominions or to injure interests of British Government. In this manner, with the exercise of a little patience, you will come forth unharmed from trouble that now envelopes all of us,and you will be stronger and freer in the future than you were before. Do not permit the foolish people to be carried away by silly talk ni jehad. Present war has nothing to do with religious matters except that it is to the interest of all religions to destroy the proud and overbearing races and strengthen quiet people w r ho only wish to preserve their independence and remain at ^ peace with their neighbours. Usual ending. I would promise to Bin Saud in addition independence and would Guarantee him against all attacks by sea. I would incite Sneikh of Koweit to attack Turkish garrisons at Jovim, Kasur, Safwan and Bubian island and would protect him from the consequences arising therefrom. I would give him a promise of immunity from taxation and full independence in regard to date gardens now in his possession on right bank of Shatt-el-Arab. As regards Mohammerab, question involves very special difficulties in view of both Kussian and Persian susceptibilities, but we could safely promise the Sheikh, I think by public announcement, that he should have fuller measure of local autonomy and complete independence as regards his date gardens on right bank of the river on the same terms as offered to Sheikh, Koweit. It would probably be sufficient if the assurances made in Captain Bird wood's letter No. 167, dated 14th February last, were publicly announced or even if a guarantee were given that, at the end of the present crisis, such announce* ment would be made.

It is clear that by encouraging Imam we can create difficulties for Turks in Nejd and Yemen. In addition, the Turkish Red Soa ports might be bombarded but sparing the Idrisi ports. The pilgrim traffic now in full operation, however, compli cates this matter. Also hostilities at Jeddah might be interpreted as preliminary attack upon Moslem holy places. As regards the Persian Gulf, w r e necessarily refrain from advice but presume Government of India would doubtless take measures to protect British shipping in those waters. If Arabs rise against Turks, Moslem Shiahs , opinion in India would be indifferent to great extent, but it is probable that educated classes would favour Turkey; but as to the Sunnis their opinion would be strongly in favour of Turkey. *7 Telegram P., No. 29, dated (and received) the 21at August 1914.

I would recommend, therefore, that another British Cavalry Kegiment should replace the 7th Dragoon Guards and that 20 th Deccan Horse and Poona Horse be replaced, if possible, by one Indian Cavalry Eegiment at least consisting of a larger proportion of Hindus.

Sir Mubarak would be glad to regain Bubian, Safwan and U m Qasr from the Turks and he anticipates no difficulty in effecting this; he also states that Basrah would gladly open its doors to occupation by the British.^ The Political Agent, Koweit, is being warned by me against taking any action without the specific approval of the Government of India; the Political Agent, Bahrein, reports that the feeling in town is pro-Prench and 8 trongly anti-German.

From—The Acting Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Maiestv*s Consul-General, Baghdad, J J To—His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. I have the honour with the utmost respect to report on the Political situation at Baghdad, Turkish Arabia. Ever since the news reached here, on August 4th, of the outbreak of European hostilities, a general mobilisation of the army has been ordered and the Beservists up to the age of 45 have been called out. This was brought to my notice by bright coloured placards on the walls. 6 Wishing to communicate the fact to Your Excellency by tele°ram, I learnt that all Consuls had been deprived of their right to communicate with their Embassies in secret language. I called with the Dragoman on the Mudir of the Telegraph office and on the Wali. Both informed me that a strict order to that effect had been received from Constantinople. I learnt the additional fact that only telegrams in Erench and Turkish would be accepted. The Wali said messages in English could be sent but my telegrams in that language were returned. On August 7th, I sent Your Excellency a telegram in Erench announcing the fact and I received your answer on August 8th informing me that you had made representations to the Porte. The Russian Consul-General received a similar telegram en clair from his Ambassador saying the Grand Yizier had promised that the prohibition would he withdrawn. Yesterday, August 9th, my Russian Colleague and I despatched a secret messenger to Kermanshah to our respective Consuls canwing cvnher telegram He should reach Kermanshah on August 14th. ^ ° :On August 7th, the Russian Consul-General was able to obtain a copy, printed in 'Turkish and Arabic, of a Proclamation from Djarid Pasha as Inspector of the 4th Inspectorate to himself as Wali of Baghdad (translation enclosed). This document speaks for itself. The chief points are (1) It is addressed entirely to Moslems and not to all Ottoman subjects, i.e.f Christians and Jews. (2) The word War is cleverly introduced. (3) The phrase “ the enemies of our religion who are towards Moslems in every instance devoid of any sign of pity” suggests, if it does not invite to a Holy War against Infidels. This Proclamation was, it is understood, to be placarded up and distributed in the mosques and streets. Our Dragoman saw a copy in the hands of a newspaper seller. The Russian Consul-General, the Drench Consul and myself after a consultation decided to see the Wali. After considerable difficulties we were able to see him and obtain a promise from him to have the Proclamation with drawn and the copies issued confiscated. So far as I know tins has been done. Is ext day the Italian and American Consuls made similar representations. Hjs Excellency assured us all individually that he was responsible for the public safety. The Wali said by way of explanation that he had never seen the Procla mation, that the editor of it bad mixed up the words ' War ” and “ Mobilisa tion ” and in fact that it was full of mistakes. I, personally, was not convinced at all by the Wali’s answers nor were m) colleagues. He seemed extremely ill at ease. The Austrian and German Consuls, my Italian Colleague tells me, made no representations although he explained the contents of the Proclamation to them. The military authorities, since the mobilisation began, have been requisi tioning mules, horses, cloth, sugar, hour, shoes, cooking pots, sewing machines, &amp;&lt;3* The matter was first brought to my notice by the refusal of the military authorities to allow 80 mules purchased by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to be exported to Mohammerah on August 3rd. - To my representations through our Dragoman they promised either to allow the mules to be exported to-day, August 10th, or to buy them. The authorities, however, haye in spite of protests done neither. Pive of the mules were, howeyer, forcibly seized by the police yesterday as they were being watered in the river and no receipt given. The state of the other mules is deplorable cooped up in a small stable with insufficient fodder as this is all commandeered by the military, they are becoming ill and their value has decreased 75 per cent. In addition to this the military authorities entered the garden and stable of a British subject and seized his horses in spice of his protests, giving him no receipt. Next day, however, they returned them saying they had registered them and would come subsequently for them. On August 8th, the military authorities entered the premises of a British shop, the Cawnpore Woollen Mills, Ijd., and requisitioned khaki cloth, giving a receipt pricing the cloth much below even the invoice value. The same day I received a telegram from Karbala announcing that wholesale requisitions were faking place there fhe details of which are not to fiand. Mules of the Anglo-Persiap Oil Company have also been seized at Baquba, no receipt being given. s . * On August 8th, I reported the occurrences to Your Excellency by telegram clair in Drench. Yesterday, August 9th, I had a long and fruitless interview With t-hQ Hireptqr of foreign Affairs in the absence of the W all.My argument was as follows (1) This Consulate-General knows officially of no abnormal conditions existing in the town. (2) I claim the inviolability of the droit de “ domicile ” and of the moveable property of the British subjects. (3) I protest, pending instructions from His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment, against the acts done as this Consulate-General was never informed nor was their representative present, and I hold the B ali responsible for all losses and damages. On my return I wrote the Wali officially expressing my views (copy enclosed). I met the Italian Consul there on the same errand. The property of Russians, Italians and Americans has been similarly treated t whether Geimans have suffered I cannot say, but I do not think so. To-day, in spite of my letter of yesterday, a Police officer called at the private house belonging to Messrs. David Sasson &amp; Co., Ltd , of London, and asked to see the Manger, a British subject, who is in residence there. The Police officer told the Manager that he was to accompany him to the « Kaimakam” and bring the keys of the various godowns with him—a request naturally refused. All these forcible acts are being done under the excuse that the town of Baghdad is proclaimed to be in an “ Mat de siege ” and martial law is in force since five or six days. The official notice only reached this Consulate-General last night, August 9th, at II p.m. This mobilisation has produced widespread discontent and resentment amongst the population. 8 The official Turkish circles, who are openly pro-German, are utilising thi resentment to excite the people against the Bussians and the English, ihi campaign is assisted by the news in the JgeiiCA Ottomams telegrams desenb- ing an unbroken series of German successes. There is some spitting and cursing against the “ Franks ” as the cause of the mobilisation, but so long as the Government officials keep a r^l y firm neutral attitude, there is, I think, nothing to he feared. *? n the ba ^’ the Government officials fan the flame and slowly inculcate the idea of a Holy War, there may easily be trouble. There is a large and influential section of the Moslems, such as the Naqibs and Abdur Rahman Haidarzadah, who are in no way deceived and prefer the English long before the Turks. ^ . In regard to the actual mobilisation of the 13th Army Corps, the figures are approximately— 109) 500 Nizam Infantry ... HO [ Regiments 111 ) 600 Military scholars. 100 Artillery , 400 Cavalry 15,000 Rediff 37 Regiment 3!) 32 Regiments 36) (quite doubtful) 16-600 add Basrah,' say 10,000 in all with Rediff. Total of XHIth Army Corps fully mobilised about 26,600 men. It is hoped to raise 30,000 men at Musal (XHth Army Corps). * When the mobilisation is complete, it is said, I learn privately, that the army is to be divided up between Basrah, Khanikm and Erzingam. At present, however, no definite orders have been received.32 Enclosure II. Copy of an esteemed order from the Inspector of the 4th Army to the Governor-Genera? Baghdad, who communicated it to the Municipality. As the order is a very important one, it is hereby published and promulgated. ? The time to prove their being Moslems has arrived for all those, each of whom, says “ I am a Moslem”. As nobody imagines that there may be a single Moslem who is ignorant of the Divine Commands in these matters I do not think it necessary to excite religions feelings by a lengthy address. * holy verse (in the Quran) orders that the blind, lame and sick are Unable to participate in war, but even from such Moslems help is expected according to their power when it is required. We must every moment bear in mind that, following in the footsteps of the Prophet of the whole Moslem world, we must put apart all our personal concerns (the Arabic runs—“our carnal pleasures”) at a time like this, and must he ready against the enemies of our religion who are towards Moslems in every instance devoid of any sign of pity. We must also bear in mind that we are categorically obliged to sacrifice when required, our souls for that purpose. Any Moslem who declines to perform this religious obligation and to obey the call to join the colours, shall not be regarded as a Moslem and the civil and human rights of such a Moslem shall not be respected at all. Those who are deserters or do not obey the invitation to join the army according to the lists to be submitted by the conscription branches are, without loss of time, killed in Constantinople (or in front of the door of happiness) (This does not exist in Arabic. It runs—“ They are killed without loss of time.”) This is their worldly punishment but God says that they shall also he punished in the coming world. It should explicitly be made known to all (the Moslems) that ^ they must at once obey the invitation made bv the Muhammadan religion. The mobilisation of the army and the collection of troops should be expedited and facilitated by their utmost endeavours, and as according to Islamic law, no believer (*'.e., Moslem) and monotheist (i e ’ Moslem) can form an exception in regard to this mobilisation and war' looting preparation which has been proclaimed, great care should he taken not to submit to those who try to commit fraud in order to enjoy exemption. The names of such people should he noted. . , y° u should employ genuinely pious and active preachers to instruct every one who call themselves Moslems, that is all learned people. Isotables and the ordinary public, that this summons must be obeyed without I expect the performance of the above-mentioned duties from your religious and patriotic feelings and I am awaiting the result (which vou by carrying out the provisions of this summons) will communicate to pie without ceasing.

Syria, especially Southern Syria, where Egyptian prosperity is tetter known, is exceedingly pro-English. I was told last winter by a very clever German named Loytoed an old friend of mine now at Haifa, that it would be impossible to exaggerate the genuine desire of Syria to come under our jurisdiction. And 1 be lieve it. Last ivUt'umn an additional impulse was given to this sentiment by the dislike of growing French influence. This dislike is universal. Germany does not count for much either way in Syria. On the Baghdad side we weigh much more heavily in the scale than Germany because of ohe importance of xndian relations - tr ide chiefly - the presence of a large body of German Engineers in Baghdad, for railway building, will be of no advantage to Germany, for they are not popular. On the whole I should say that 'ItaS?' would not willingly see Turkey at war with us and would take no active part in it. But out there, the Turks would probablyprobably turn their attention to Arab chiefs who have received our protection. Such action v/ould be extremely unpopular with the Arab Unionists who look on Sayid Tallb of Basreh, Koweit, and Ibn Ba’ad, as powerful prot^onists. Say ’yid Tallb ie a rogue, he has had no help from us, but our people (merchants) have maintained excellent terms with him. Koweit depends for Ids life on our help and he knows it. ibn Sa*ad is most anxious to get some definite recognition from us and would be easy to secure as an ally. i think we could make it pretty h t for the Turks in the Gulf. it is perhaps worth knowing that Lynch’s Agent in Baghdad, r. Arthur Tod (an able man) is on the closest terms of intimacy with the leading Arab of Baghdad Abdul -adir ^ nsla, Qudairy, who is very /ell disposed to us. d Arab chief likes Turkish rule. This man Abdul dadir and Bayyid Talib , are far more powerful influences in their respective towns than the Turkish Vali. The Sheikh of I uhammerah, is not a negligible factorfactor by any means, and is our ally. If Turkey went to war it is possible that the Arab jnionists might take that opportunity to throw off the yoke - perhaps they would not take the initiative but they would not be difficult to direct, on those lines. The compli cation in Syria in that the Trench have earmarked it and the people want up f not franco. The above is fully corroborated by reports re ceived from our inspectors in the Arab Vilayets.

The instructions referred to by our Busreh Agents were as follows:- 3 Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office.\T~lO) 'If the service is suspended by the requisition of coal bring Tigris steamers to Mahomraerah and retain them there until further orders.' On the 21st. instant our Busreh agents wired that postal communication from Busreh (presumably to the United Kingdom) had ceased. The stoppage of the British steamer service on the Tigris will cause dislocation of trade and alarm among the British community at Baghdad, to say nothing of the financial loss to this Company and other British interests. It might be feasible to run the steam tugs belonging to the Societe de Transports Fluviaux en Orient, employed until the war broke out, in trans porting material for the Baghdad Railway Company, which are under the control of this Company at Busreh, to continue British communications between Busreh and Baghdad, but having regard to the uncertainty of the situation in Turkey, I am dif’ected to add by my Board of Directors that they propose to take no steps to adopt such an arrangement to■.r.ijggZ-U get over the difficulty until His Majesty’s Government are in a position to indicate to them the best course to pursue.

Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive at your earliest convenience, His Lordship’s observations regarding the cX position of the ‘’Comet” and the Indian guard of His Majesty's Consulate-General in that city.

Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 6, 9 p.m.) Constantinople, September 6, 1914. (No. 712.) (September 6, 2*5 p.m.) ACTING British, consul-general at Bagdad is much exercised as to safety of British subjects there in the event of war with Turkey. At present, only British vessel available there besides “ Comet ” is launch “ Ishtar ” belonging to Lynch. Women and children cannot leave gradually, nor can they go via Persia unprotected. If danger arose, English community could be sheltered temporarily in the consulate, but should they have to leave Bagdad, only means would be to go home in a Lynch steamer. Acting consul-general leaves me to judge whether present situation makes it desirable to have such a steamer sent immediately from Karun. He does not know what Turkish attitude would be in the event of war, but fears authorities might not allow British subjects to leave Basra. He suggests that if British subjects were left in their homes, United States consul might reside in our consulate-general, and they could seek shelter there in case of danger. He cannot pronounce as to what local feeling would be owing to conflicting influences at work. Military authorities are sending troops to Basra as fast as steamer facilities will allow ; 2,000 had left up to 1st September and 6,000 more were to follow. Acting consul-general states that Germans are exerting very bitter and anglophobe influence. He is also exercised as to the fate of Indian guard rifles and the “ Comet” in the event of war. He asks whether Government of India would like that it should leave at once for Karun taking women and children, and whether in last resort they would approve of dismantling of guns or making engines unserviceable. Acting consul-general also asks whether he may send “ Ishtar ” to Basra with mails to catch outward post from there, or whether he had better retain her.

Immediate question is whether, either in present circumstances or in the event of war, apprehension need be entertained for their safety. I cannot from here estimate danger of popular outbreak. “ Report number of Englishwomen and children who have to be considered. I presume other British subjects would run infinitely less risk.

CONFIDENTIAL. % Mr. Beaumont to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 29, 3*45 p.m.) Constantinople, July 29, 1914. (No. 459.) R. (July 29, 2’35 p.m.) FOLLOWING from consular officer at Basra, No. 68 of yesterday: “ Ajeymi has written to my dragoman over his seal asking him to communicate to me letter from his secretary. Latter says that various influential men, including Vali of Bagdad, have advised Ajeymi to remain quiet, hut he is resolved to attack Basra and kill Talih unless his demands are conceded. Dismissal of Vali is satisfactory, hut he demands also death of Talib and exile of his supporters. Letter concludes with request for an answer. I have replied I can have nothing to do with the matter. “ During last week there have been many robberies on the outskirts of Basra. These are officially, but probably wrongly, attributed to Ajeymi [two groups undecypher able]. Vali seems unwilling to adopt repressive policy. This is due partly, no doubt, to lack of [group omitted: ? courage], but partly, I believe, to unusual intelligence. Nevertheless, he is resolved to make Ajeymi [?] from his present quarters, which are not many hours’ distant from Basra.” Z 31JUL1914 r % 1705—604 jN In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. and address— The Under-Secretary' of State, Foreig;n Office, London. t \\ /Ol P The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop ^ of the under-mentioned paper.
