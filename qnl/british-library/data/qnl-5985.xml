The first indicates that the matter is likely to be taken up officially on Sir Trencnard powle’s return; and tne second amounts to tne communication of official advice, and we should be put in an awkward position if the Shaikh ignored it or refused point blank to act on it. 4. I think we must maintain tne principle, so far as we far as I can see the only outside chance of putting in a word for Shaikh Hamood would come if Shaikh Ahmad himself mentioned his name to you; or perhaps complained about unfair publicity, in which case you might see an opportunity of saying in a purely private capacity that he might find it worth his while to remove a possible cause for public criticism by being a little more generous to Hamood. Even then it would be extremely important to avoid giving any impression that it was advice of an icial nature, and I quite realise that it is not too likely / G.S.de Gaury, MG.» Political Agent, 2 There seems to be a spate of people '•casting themselves % aid against them also, as has happened recently in a couple of cases down here. 3 I think it might be a little dangerous to follow either possibly can, of non-interference in family affairs, and as Kuwait- 2 - likely that anything effective would result. 5.

It seems that a majlis did meet once or twice and then died. The leader of the majlis party in those days was Abdulla Saqir, as he is today a \ 3.

There has been much conflicting gossip in the town, but there is no doubt that the immediate cause of^cessation of meetings was the inspection of Shaikh ITahad as Salim f s accounts during his absence in Bahrain, When Pahad returned to Kuwait he made a great fuss, said his honour had been impugned and quarrelled violently with tho members Shaikh Yusuf bin Isa, Khalid as ^aid and Thaniyan al Ghanim, the three non-Subah members of the M ajlis who had taken part in the inspection of the accounts, ^his quarrel is unlikely to be forgotten in the near future since ?ahad spat in the faces of the latter two members, 3, The As Subah are divided amongst themselves and some of them do not support Fahad. The position is further conqpli- cated by Shaikh Abdulla Salim and his party being anxious to oust Shaikh Ali al Khalifah - a man of great character ani His Highness* strongest supporter - from the position of 'Director of Law and Order*, 4. it has been reported that His Highness is very pleased that the members of the Majlis have quarrelled among themselves. This is quite probably true as the various forms of Majlis have given him so much trouble during the last two years. There is little doubt that Shaikh Ahmad has made no attempt to persuade t '* 10 Majlis to resume its meetings. ; &gt; 5. While I was talking to His Highness yesterday about # eduoatioiv / The Hon , ble Lieut-Colonel C.G, Prior, CIS., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.education in Kuwait he referred to the Majlis and I mentioned casually that I had heard it had not met for two months. His expression and manner changed completely as if the subject was most distasteful and he said rather hastily that the weather had “been hot and most of the members had been absent from Kuwait, I immediately dropped the subject but the reference to the Majlis had evidently upset the Shaikh as he seemed ill at ease for the rest of the interview. There is not a shadow of doubt that the reasons given by His Highness for the cessa- tion of the meetings are not the correct ones. 6 . Shaikh Abdulla Salim returned from a short visit to Baghdad two days ago and it is said that something will soon be done to end the impasse. It is important to remember that the administration is going on as usual under the direction of the leading Sfcecutive officers, i.e. Shaikh All al Khalifah Director of Law and Order, Shaikh Abdulla Jabir Chief Magis trate^ Shaikh Subah as Salim Commandant of Police.

I do not think that there is anything parti cularly objectionable in his action, though strictly of course he should have spoken to me first.

K 2 * tfubah ere, broadly speaking, split into two factions, the bheikh*s who support Ahmad and those who support the oalim branch. Of the former the most important are *vli A1 Khalil ah, grandson of Abdulla the eldest brother of ubarak, and Ahmad’s son Abdullah, a ponderous person in charge of the Arsenal. The c&amp;lim are three in number, Abdulla who is in charge of the Treasury and President of the iTahad his half brother who actually runs the Treasury, and aubah mio is in charge of the Police, A turbulent young JhaiKh who seems chiefly to be out for himself is Abdulla &lt;*.1 Mubarak the only surviving son of kubarak, 3. The quarrel is, of course, in reality a family ieud dating I^odi the time Ahmad was elected Shaikh and which came to a head in 1938. It is again raising its head, not I think in a form dangerous to our interests, but slightly disturbing nevertheless, in view of the pro-Nazi tendencies of the Salims. That the feud is not crushed is due solely to the weakness of ^hrnad who, now that the younger Shaikhs are growing up, needs to show a stronger front whereas he does the reverse.

The race had led the tiubah to engage in sorno iinseetsily quarrelling in public much to the detriment of their prestige. It has indeed, been said to me that tlie people are glad to see this inter-family quarrelling as it weakens their position. 4.

I4y dear Scott, I went to see ohaiKh All ai Khalifah at the Mission Hospital yesterday and had a talk with Scudder about his general condition and his chances of recovery. I gather that Scudder wants him to go to the Lebanon as soon as he can be moved but that in his present condition he is quite unfit to undertake the land journey and it seems probable that he may never recover sufficiently here to be moved by land. In normal times I would endeavour to obtain an aircraft from the R.A.F but of course in these days that is quite impossible. Do you think that there would be any possibility of the A.I.O.C flying him from here to Damascus? He could be met there by an ambulance and taken straight to the sanatorium. It is unnecessary for me to remind you of Shaikh Ali’s popularity both with the Subah family and the people of Kuwait who will all appreciate a service rendered to the most respected of the Subah Shaikhs.

I visited is Highness at 9.30 a.m. on the 4th April accom panied by sir John ,7ard. The shaikh looked well and was in a very affable mood, sir John Ward left about 10 a.m. and I remained behind and discussed various business matters until about 10.30 a.m. when I took leave of His Highness who informed me that he would send letters to me to be taken by me to Ibn saud. Various attempts were mada by Izzat Jaffer His Highness f Social Secretary to speak to me on the telephone during the / evening but unfortunately I was busy with preparations for my journey to Riyadh and was not in when he rang up and my/attempt to get in touch with him failed, about 10 p.m. Dr. scudoer of the American Mission rang me up and informed me that His Highness* condition was critical. He said that the Shaikh had had a slight attack at 11.30 a.m. but had thought nothing of it and had gone CUL to Fantas to lunch with Abdullah^Nafisi,the Saudi Government Agent. During lunch the Shaikh had had pain in the region of the heart an^d after returning to his house in the late afternoon had had a second and more serious attack. Izzat jaffer at once got in touch with him^**. Scudder, and he had examined him anc diagnosed Coronary Thrombosis. Dr. Scudder considered that the Shaikh must be kept as quiet as possible and for that reason he desired to keep the gravity of his condition as cpstsrt as possible. I informed him that I would postpone my departure for Riyadh and asked him to see me after seeing the Shaikh in the early morning. I i-jnediately telegraphed to the Hon’ble the Political Resident and informed him of the shaikh*s condition. At 8.13 a.m. on the 5th Dr. sounder and Iz^at jaffer called and the former stated that there was no i .provement in His Highness* condition although the fact that he was still alive was a favourable indication that he might survive the present attack. Izzat Jaffer said that His Highness* two younger sons Jabir and Subah were with their father who was being looked after by his own servants. At my suggestion Izzat Jaffer returned to Dasman. Dr. Scudder then discussed the case with Squadron Leader Freezer of the R.A.F. Medical Service who was staying with me and later the Squadron Leader informed me that his opinioncoincided with that of Dr. Scudaer f s. I enquired if Dr. scudder would like an outside opinion and he replied that while he had little doubt of the correctness of his diagnosis and that every- skilled opinion and suggested Dr. Thornton of Basra. The question with Mr. Scott the General Superintendent of the Kuwait Oil Company who arrived opportunely at that moment and at my request he despatched a telegram through one of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company’s tugs lying at Shuwaikh to the General Manager of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company at Abadan asking for a physician to be f flown down as soon as possible for consultation with Dr. Scudder. Dr. Scudder was still very anxious to keep the matter as quiet as possible in order to ensure h* ..mnofr res$ to the shaikh ses. but I told him that I felt that his Secretary and the two senior Government Officials present should be informed and asked him to remain and speak to them himself. I then asked shaikh Abdullah Jabir the Chief Judge and Director of Education, shaikh f» U*. O J ^ ~ v J ^ propriety of informing him. They stated that they proposed to do Dr. Scudder said that he would have no objection to Shaikh c*-' Abdullah jabir and shaikh Abdullah Mtfbcftruk seeing His Highness Shaikh Abdulla Mpboruk said that he had seen His Highness earlier in the morning. I asked Colonel Dickson to call and see me and informed him of what had occured and the steps I had thought -it to take. He stated that he was in entire agreemnet with the action that I thing possible was being done for the patient he would welcome any of ways and means of getting in touch with doctors was discussed so and also His Highness’ eldest son shaikh Abdullah al Ahmad. b it was op-osed to any other person being permitted to do so. had/had taken and warned me that shaikh Abdullah Salim was of a hysterical nature and might disturb His Highness. It then occured to me that it might be a pleasant gesture to offer the Agency Launch to take the message to shaikh Abdullah Salim and I rang up His Highness’ Secretary and made the offer. I was much surprised to hear that Shaikh ^bdullah Salim was actually present in Kuwait. I at once asked the Secretary to get in touch with him and ask him to call upon me as soon as possible. Shaikh ..bdullah Salim arrived about 10.20 a.m. and appeared very cheerful and looked well. I explained exactly what had taken pPo^QQ and how it came about that X had not asked him to be present earlier in the morning when I saw the other Shaikhs. He appeared tc be satisfied that he had not been intentionally omitted and in formed me that as soon as he was informed of His Highness’ con dition he went to see him and was very surprised to find him cheerful. I informed Shaikh Abdullah Salim that a specialist was due at any moment from Abadan and that I would like him to call again when he had seen the Shaikh and hear from the specialist in person his opinion of His Highness’ condition. I also intimated that I had asked Shaikh Abdullah Jabir and shaikh Abdulla rob$ruk and Abdulla Hulia to e present fo* the same purpose. Shaikh Abdulla Salim said that it was quite unnecessary for them, to come but that naturally he would be very pleased to hear what the specialist had to say, I replied that I had already invited the gentlemen and did not now propose to withdraw my invitation. ^.t 11.20 a.m. Dr. Maclean arrived from Abadan ana after a brief talk with Dr. Scudder at the Agency went to Dasman to see His Highness. I asked the Shaikhs previously referred to to be present at 12.15 p.m. at the agency to meet the two Medical men and hear their opinion. Dr. Maclean and Dr. scudder returned from Dasman a few minutes after twelve noon and the former confirmed Dr. Scudders diagnosis and went on to state that in his opinion His Highness had a reasonable chance of recovery provided another attack did not occur which it might do at any time, possibly during sleip. He further stated that it was impossible to make any definite4 (tod) statement one way or the other and that even if he did pull through he would not regain his accustomed health and would always be liable to another and probably fatal attack. .Vhen the Shaikhs had assembled at 12.15 p.m. Dr. Maclean clearly explainea the position to them ana emphasised that the most important thing was rest and quiet. He informeu them that hs had agreed to remain in Kuwait for two or three days to collab orats with Dr. Scuduer in the treatment of the case. Written at 1.20 p.m. on the 5th xipril. ppE April bth . The Doctors informeu me this morning that His Highness’ heart condition appearea more satisfactory but that unfortunately his general condition had deteriorated and an examination of his urine had revealed kidney trouble. In their o inion they consid ered that he should be moved to Abadan as soon as ossible where he could be more satisfactorily examinee, and a line of treatment decided upon. The.' considered that if he remained here it would not be possible to treat him correctly and t at the danger of the journey was less than that which ould be incurred by his staying here without ad .quote treatment. They asked my advice and I stated that trie matter rested witn the Shaikh himself and suggest ed that they should give him their opinion in the evening when they paid their next visit ana that they should inform the senior members of the family of their views whatever * is ighness decided after their interview with him and ask for a definite answer tomorrow morning. I askea Colonel Dickson to join the conference and after hearing the Medical Officers he concurred in the line of action I suggested. I teen instructed nbdul..ah Liulia to ensure that the members of the family were present at Dasman, and agreed that it would be better for Shaikh Abdullah Salim and himself to meet the Doctors and not necessarily the whole family to whom the Medical view coula be conveyed by shaikh xTbdullah Salim.5.

'J.J.' authorised us to get a portable electrocardiograph after T got back to Abadan and told him the position.

The instrument is beingordered by cable from India and if obtainable there will be delivered to us by AIR MAIL,so the delay - if all goes well - may not be very great. If India is a dry well we will have to get the gadget from the U.5.A. again ordering by cable and taking delivery by AIR MAIL,in this c-'se however the delay may amount to a month or two. I did a further blood test on after getting back to the Laboratory and have given the result to Scudder,the treatment of the case will be greatly simplified and facilitated in consequence nd • resumption of full activities - in J^Lace of the former modified exercise allowance - may confidently^ predicted in a few months time.

April 1942 My dear Hickinbotham, I was very pleased to hear from Dr. Marsh, on his return from Kuweit, that he considered His Highness’s general condition, although still very serious, more hopeful; but he remarked that His Highness would have to conform to a strict routine in the future. You are probably aware our Medical Staff do not permit themselves to receive fees for such professional services as have been rendered to His Highness, and the Company also does not make any charge. We are, therefore, in a bit of a difficulty regarding the cheques for I.D.50/- and I.D. 40/- which His Highness has given to Dr. McClean and Dr. Marsh. It was very generous of him doing so but, any services that have been rendered to His Highness, we would like to feel have been given as a small token of our esteem and friendship. Again, we would not like to hurt His Highness’s feelings in any way, and would like your advice as to what we should do in the matter. It has been suggested by the Doctors that they might give the money to the Kuweit Mission Hospital to buy some piece of equipment. Yours sincerely, Major Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Kuweit. P.S. As His Highness’s Syrian A.D.C., I forget his name, was foolish enough to ask the Doctors not to divulge that fees had been given to them, I think he should be told in a nice way that such things are not done by British professional gentlemen.D.O.

I have referred the matter of the Sheikh coming to Abadan and our Doctors advise as follows. They state that they have weighed up the relative value of obtaining a cardiogran. with the possibility of causing a set-back in the patient's prospects of recovery by a journey such as is contemplated, especially as they are now satisfied as to his medical condition and the most effective treatment, and also that the obtaining of a cardiogram would not affect in any way this treatment. Further, if there was less danger in moving the patient, such a cardiogram would be a useful confirmation of the extent of the disease only. On balance their conclusion is that it would be inadvisable to move the patient at the present time. few days, will however after further examination be able to confirm or amend this opinion to Dr. Scudder and the Sheikh.

The Sheikh of Kuwait to Abadan. 1 would like to make it clear that the Mec'icsi Service, both staff and equimpent, of the A.I.O.C. at Abadan is at the service of the Sheikh now and at any time. I have refened the matter of the Sheikh coming to Abadan and our Doctors advise as foil! ows. They state that they have weighed up the relative value of obtaining a cardiogram with the possibility of causing a *et-back in the patient’s prospects of recovery by a journey such as is contemplated, especially as they are now satisfied as to his medical condition and the most effective treatment, and also that thf obtain ing of a cardiogram would not affect in any way this treatmeit. further, if there was less danger in moving the patient, suet a cardiogram would be a useful confirmation of the extent of the disease only. On balance their conclusion is that it would te inadvisable to move the patient at the present time. Dr. McClean, who will visit the Sheikh within th* next few days, will however after further examination be able to confirm or amend this opinion to Dr. Scudder and the Sheikh. So far as the A.I.O.C. is concerned the matter is entirely a medical one ard in the hands of the Doctors, who, needless to say, will do the best they can for their patient. Yours sincerely, Sgd.

On -lay 4th.I received a letter dated May 3rd.from 'H.H.' - probably brought by MeClean who went over to Kuwait that day with Cass - in this letter was enclosed a very nice photograph of 'H.H.' and a. delightful letter,from ’which I quote, ' In reply to your remarks about my present,! would like to say that it is not in return ior your valuable assistance,for which,I consider,no present will ever be sufficient.

India and the War .—The Russian successes, including the crossing of tljp\1939 frontier of Poland^ are fully appreciated in India. The difficulties wnick hold up the British and American forces in Italy are less understood. The advance in Arakan, where Maungdavv has recently been captured, is welcome. There was speculation as to the slight losses suifered by the Japanese when they bombed Calcutta in mid-December; but the failure of the raid on Chittagong on December 26th and the smashing victory on the morning of December 31st over the force which attempted to interfere with our planes returning from the bombing of Ramree Island have restored confidence. The danger to India from Japan by sea and land has long been discounted by popular opinion. In the November Appreciation mention was made of the aid given by the Army, on the initiative of Lord Wavell immediately after he became Viceroy/ to the afflicted areas in Bengal. Not only in the distribution of food but also in the fight against disease resulting from the famine of last year, relief has been rapid and thorough, and the Army has won the gratitude of the people. The Viceroy, in addressing the Associated Chambers of Commerce in Calcutta on December 20th, referred to the generous measure of assistance given to Bengal by the Central Government in other respects also: and added' that the solution of Bengal’s food problem now lies in Bengal’s hands: the Central Government cannot continue indefinitely to “carry’'a Province to which Nature has vouchsafed so generous a crop, if through administrative inefficiency the Province fails to secure that it is properly f* hired and distributed. It is not yet certain that fine best possible use will be made of the crop ; and there seems no good reason why the price of rice in Bengal should again be rising. The appointment of Mr. Casey to the Governorship of Bengal has been received with approval on personal grounds and as a recognition of the importance of the problems now facing the Bengal administration : at the same time it has been condemned by nationalists on the ground of the exclusion of Indians from Australia.2 The National Defence Council has just finished a session in Delhi. A new feature of its deliberations was an address by Lord Louis Mountbatten on the work of South-East Asia Command. Political.—The Viceroy in his Calcutta speech said that he did not believe he could make the solution of the constitutional and political problems of India easier by talking about them at present; the winning of the war, the organisa tion of the economic home front, and the preparation for peace call for the use of all the resources of the country in determination, energy and intelligence ; but he would welcome co-operation from any quarter in the achievement of the great administrative aims which should be common* to all parties when country is in peril, and thereby conditions would be produced in which tuL solution of the political deadlock would be possible. During the Christmas season the political parties (other than the Congress which is still in eclipse) have as usual held conferences and made pronounce ments. At the session of the All-India Muslim League at Karachi Mr. Jinnah invented a new slogan—the British should “divide and quit”; but otherwise the only novelty was the establishment of a “ committee of action ” to organise Muslims all over India to resist the imposition of a unitary constitution and to prepare for the coming struggle for the achievement of Pakistan. On the other hand the All-India liindu Mahasabha, meeting at Amritsar, demanded the preservation of the integrity of India, the introduction of Pederation with a strong centre, and the refusal to any Province, community or section of the right to secede. It is once more clear therefore that the aims of these two bodies cancel out. In their attitude to Congress also they are divergent; the Muslim League maintains its hostility to Congress policy, whereas the Mahasabha demands the immediate release of the Congress leaders and other political prisoners. The National Liberal Federation, meeting at Bombay, also desired the release of the Congress leaders, in the hope (for wdiich no grounds were stated) that they would defer to popular opinion and abandon the policy wdiich led to the rebellion of August 194i2. General .—There has been some restlessness in Waziristan, culminating in an attack upon troops near Razmak. Order has, however, been restch. act. India as a whole is tranquil and the economic condition of the country has certainly improved. Delhi has recently been the scene of the annual session of the Indian Science Congress, which was opened by the Viceroy. Messages of goodwill from Mr. Churchill and Field-Marshal Smuts were brought to it by Professor Hill, the Secretary of the Royal Society, who is visiting India to assist in the examination by scientists of problems which will arise in India after the v r ar.*3 Printed in England. .Sept 1942.

Reference my telegram dated 28th.October from /ounding of Shaikh Mohammed bin Ahmed. 2 . Shaikh Mohammed’s life is now out of danger. In addition to the v/ound in his throat he has lost his right 1 thumb. 3* His version of the incident is that he left ^ Basra on the ^3rd. October on a hawking expedition during - which he did not leave Iraq territory. On his ret’ju?n7'^fie!i he had reached a point so ie 7 miles west of £ubair , a Mutairi guide who was sitting in the body of the pick-up announced that a Police car was folio ing them. Shaikh Mohammed^stopped his car and, at the ,rme time, the Police opened fire with a machine— un. He is now anxious to see exemplary punish lent meted out to his assailants. 4* The Iraqi version is tha'i the shaikh’s car entered Iraq in the neighbourhood of Suleiman! to the west of Jabal Sanam, where it was seen by a Police patrol car. As the locality was far from the usual route from Kuwait to Iraq, the Police suspected smuggling and gave chase. The Shaikh’s car accelerated and was chased for some 35 kilometers and, when they feared they were going to lose it in the tamarisks to the west of Zubair, the Police opened fire as a warning to stop. As their car was in motion and bumping some of the bullets hit the Shaikh’s oar instead of passing over it as was intended. Shaikh Mohammed’s war was found to contain 44 packets of tea, one 4 -gallon kerosene tin full of tea and one full of sugar, and a roll of 40 yards of cloth. This story was told me by the Police at Zubair (where the Mutassarrif had previously been to investigate) and will not necessar ily be identical with the official Iraqi version. 5* Shaikh Mohammed was seen buying piece-goods in Kuwait on the 26th. in the same car and with the saiie driveras were with him when he was shot, and it is inher ently probable that he would take the opix&gt;ptunity, while4-4 [ \| : (ri av;ay in the desert, of visiting his relatives in Kuwait* It is not unlikely that f while there, he would lay in a stock of tea, etc., which is very difficult to oorne 'by in Iraq.

His Majesty's Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has the honour to inform them that a report has been received from His Majesty's Consul-General at Basra stating that Muhammad as Sabah, son of the Shaik- of Kuwait, was shot at by an Iraqi police car whj e hawking near Zubair a few days ago and was seriously wounded in the throat. It is reported that one of his servants was killed. 2 0 It appears that Shaikh Muhammad's car way have failed to stop when summoned to do so by an Iraqi police patrol; but sine Shaikh Muhammad is normally resident in Basra he should be faiily well known to the Iraqi police in that area. The Embassy will be glad if full details of the affair may be communicated as soon as possible, and it sincerely hopes that it may be authorised to express to the Shaikh of Kuwait the regrets of the Iraqi Government at this unfortunate incident. His Majesty's Embassy avails itself of this opportunity to renew the expression of its highest consideration.

Bahrain - By the Ahram’s special correspondent. His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit, Ahmad al Jabir Al Sabah, gave me a ^alk* in which he expressed the strong connecting ties between Egypt and Koweit. Amongst other things His Highness said that there was no stronger proof of the mutual feelings existing bet ween the two countries than his visits to Egypt which had taken place on more than one occasion. He said that he admired the abundance and noble expression of the feelings which the Egyptians showed towards him. 2. Then His Highness spoke about Arab Unity saying that indeed the truth must be stated in that there is no difference between Koweitis and Egyptians, and that it is sufficient to say that the Arab Unity existing between us and Egypt is not nominal, rather it has taken steady practical forward steps, and that this cultural co-operation between Egypt and Koweit is nothing but a practical realisation of some of the targe of Arab Unity. A source of our pride is that Egypt assists morally and materially in the realising of cultu aims and suffice it to say that she has selected us out from many cultural concessions. 3. After mentioning that the educational revival in his country is largely due to the generous hand which Egypt has extended to her so often, His Highness said that he took this opportunity to send to the generous people of Egypt his very best wishes for the independence with which they are blessed in the shade of the Great Faruq that pious king in whom Egypt finds her strength and in whom the Arabs take pride.COMJIJSNTIAL The R&gt;litioal Agency, KUWAIT.

Sir Rupert Hay. KCIE., CSI., Political .Resident, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.—PERSIAN GULP RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN* 27th tetotor, 1949. SSMUB BUW (28/35/49) The Political Agent, Kuwait, has reported that Shaikh Abdulla Mubarak, uncle of the Ruler of Kuwait, during a recent visit to Beirut was decorated by the President of the Lebanese Republic with the Order of Merit (gold) and that a similar decoration was sent by his hand for Isxat Jaffar, the Ruler 1 * Aide-dA-Camp. The Political Agent has asked for Instructions of\ the official attitude, If any, that should be adopted towards the award of decorations by the Lebanon and neighbouring Moslem states to members of the Kuwait ruling family. 2. In 1932 when the Ruler of Kuwait was on a visit to King Faisal of Iraq, he was awarded the Order of Rafldaln (First Class). Shaikh Ahmed asked at the time whether he could wear the Insignia on official occasions. The matter was referred to the Government of India, who replied that there was no objection to his doing so. The possibility of the grant of a further Iraqi decora tion to the Shaikh has already been referred to In the fourth paragraph of Eastern Department*s letter (E9378/ 1944/91) of the 5th September to the Baghdad Chancery. ^ S: ?/ ; , 3. I presume there Is no objection so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned to the award of foreign decorations to subjects of the Gulf States, and to their wearing the Insignia of these decorations, but should be grateful If this could kindly be confirmed. The award to Izsat Jaffar is somewhat unfortunate in view of his past record, but I do not see that we can object to It. He Is still an Egyptian by nationality though It Is understood he proposes to ask Shaikh Ahmed to allow him to become a Kuwait subject. 4.
