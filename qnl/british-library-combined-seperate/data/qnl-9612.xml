The report concerns Shahzada Nasrulla Khan of Afghanistan and his return trip from England following a state visit during the summer of 1895; the focus of the report is the part of the journey between Marseilles and Suez, which was undertaken aboard HMS
                           Clive.The report briefly mentions an outbreak of sickness among the crew of HMS
                           Clive, and a brief visit made to Rome at the Shahzada's request. However, the main focus is on the measures taken during the trip by Sir William Fitzgerald to — successfully — dissuade Nasrulla Khan from making a trip to Mecca and Medina. This includes preventing the ship from touching at Yembo [Yanbuʻ al-Baḥr] and issues surrounding Nasrulla Khan disembarking at Suez; these issues relate to objections from the Egyptian authorities to the Shahzada landing with a group of armed followers.Appended to the report is a list of relevant telegrams from the aforementioned voyage between 30 September 1895 and 4 October 1895. The principal correspondents are Sir William Fitzgerald, Lord Cromer [Evelyn Baring], and Edmund Neel (Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department at the India Office).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Afghanistan</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HMS Clive, Indian troopship</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Aide-de-Camp to the Secretary of State for India</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department,</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0002cc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
