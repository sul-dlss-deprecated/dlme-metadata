From our records the total amount paid to the Electric Department fer the year April 1939 to Parch 1940 amounts to ;u*2728/-. This includes Agency Offices, Residence and Hospital* As you know this Agency used to maintain its own electric lighting plant and from the records it appears that the running costs of this plant were as follows Y ear * 1926- 27 1927- 28 1928- 29 1929- 30 Expenditure rs. 1804-14 to.1208-10 Hs.1682- 7 i,i*1332-10 The average of this comes to iis*1507 per annum over four3 © foul* yeftra as nf^inst tho present expenditure of ^*2 n 28/~ per annum, i.e. a saving of is.1221/- P«r ann^im. The amount of saving however would be increased by the fact that a sum of .u..600/- per annum was charged as pay of the engine driver. As re already have a staff of launch engineers it would probably not be necessary to engago a special tnan for the electric lighting plant. Another factor is that kerosene and lubricating oil used in those days had to be imported from *.badan whereas they are now obtainable locally at a cheaper rate presumably; but in any c^se t?ven as the figures stand and with the present consump tion it would seen to be feasible for the Government of India to reinstall its own electric power and run it at a saving after allowing for capital costs, depreciation, etc. If the new air conditioning scheme comes into being it would mean a large increase in consumption of electricity both for the apparatus itself and for pumping of water required and the amount of saving which would accrue to the Government of India would consequently be greater. As the whole object of having a communal electric plant was to secure electricity at a cheaper rate than it could be produced individually I think the time lias come to consider whether there is not something radically wrong when we find that we have to pay over 80% more for our current now than we previously used to do at a time when the expenses of production must have been greater than they now are. In this connection it may also be noticed that a local merchant has found it cheaper to buy his own electric power plant for operating an ice machine than to take power from the Manama supply. This merchant tells me that he was being charged from anna 1 to as. 6 per unit by the State Electric Department and that he is now ab3e to produce it himself at a cost of a quarter of an anna per unit. He has also nearly paid off the cost of his plant. 3. It is difficult to see any reason why electricity should not be supplied in Manama at the same rate or even less tiian is the case at 3asra where the oil fuel lias to be broughtbrought from sone considerable distance. It may be argued that more power is used in Basra for running machinery etc., but as has been Hentioned above the only factory which uses electric power in ' anama was forced to produce its own electric current and it has also to be conside ed that the Ag ncy and Hospital which supplied its own electric light at a rate about 45^ below what is now being paid to the ffonam Electric Deparijment did not use any electricity for power plant. 4. 1 see from a recent report written by Weightman in connection with l anama that he nride this remark Bates for lighting are much too high'* and in view of the foregoing figures 1 feel he is right and I am informed by a large number of the consumers that they are seriously discontented with what they consider to be an excessively high rate per unit now being charged. 1 have today been informed by some prominent merchants t:»at a number of potential consumers are being kept out by the present high rates and would like to avail themselves of current if the chargee were more reasonable. I would be most grateful if you would kindly consider this matter and let me know your view* . Yourr, sincerely, sd- r.g.e.y;.

Dear iilban, v ^ ^ f $ With reference to your letter No. 2286-6/13 dated December 9, 1940, on the subject of the charges which are made by this government for electric current and the high cost of the electrical consumption of the .agency buildings. The local electrical rates are high in Bahrain and they do compare unfavourably with places like Karachi and Basra, but not with towns of the consumer capacity of Manamah and Muharraq. 2, In your letter you compare the expenditure of running an independent lighting plant at the Agency dur ing 1926 - 30 with the amount which is now being paid by the Political Agent for electric current and you sug gest that if an independent lighting plant was installed again the difference between the average annual expendi ture in 1926 - 30 and present day annual expenditure on electricity would be saved. I do not agree with this contention. The lighting plant which used to supply the Agency was a small machine and its connected load was 2.5 kilo- wats, it provided six fans and not more than 20 lights at the agency and four lights and two fans in the hospital building. In those days no other electric apparatus was used. The total consumption, using the same ratio of consumption as at present, would be 2137 units, therefore the cost per unit was approximately Rs -/ll/3. 3. Today the Agency and hospital and courts are equipped with 85 lights, 31 fans, 3 a.C. units, 2 refri gerators, 2 electric pumps and a certain number of table lights and fans, wireless sets etc. The total connected load —© - 2 - load is now 11 kilowats, last year the agency consumed 940£ units and the cost, Rs 2,948/- averages at/Jk -/5/- per unit. The total connected load is now about four and a half times more than it was in 1929 and the cost per unit is less than half, I think it can be reason ably said that the current is more satisfactory than when it was supplied from the agency plant. We have had one breakdown, which lasted for about an hour, in nine years. The Agency plant used to work intermittently and during part of the year it was shut down in the day time. I remember myself staying at the Agency in the days of the agency plant when hand pulled punkahs were still used. We provided prisoners to pull them. The cost of running the machine which provided the amount of electricity which was used in 1926 - 30 cannot reason ably be compared with the cost of providing the very much greater load which is being used today. 4. The price of fuel and lubricating oil is pro bably less in Bahrain than it is in Karachi and possibly less than in Basrah though the Iraq government receives a proportion of its royalty in kind. I have no means of comparing the actual costs. But fuel oil is a very small proportion of the cost of running an electric supply. Last year the total cost of generation was Rs 1,05,596/- of which Rs 15,225/- was the cost of fuel oil and engine stores etc. 5. Regarding Hussein Yatim’s ice plant, his state ment that he was being charged from anna -/!/- to annas -/6/- for current is somewhat misleading. He consumed 40,000 units in 1358 when he took current from the govern ment and the average cost per unit to him was Rs -/1/3. He imported a 25 kilowat generating set with the intention of running it intermittently for cold storage purposes in —■■■■■ © / ^ -3- : - in winter and making ice in the summer. He considered that it would be cheaper to run his own set than to take a supply from the government on a sliding scale basis, Ihe engine is now idle during the winter months. If he used his engine all the year round it would be cheaper for him to take current from the government but by using only during part of the year he would not profit so much from the sliding rate. The engine cost Rs 13,000/-, at his own estimate plus erections etc. a total of about Rs 14,000/-. If depreciation was put at 10$ it would amount to Rs 1,400/- per annum. Depreciation is neces sary whether the engine is running or not. The depre ciation Rs 1,400/- divided by 40,000 units makes the price per unit generated Rs -/-/6 in addition to fuel, oil, insurance and wages which v/ould bring the price per unit approximately Rs -/!/-. I think that when stating that he could generate a unit for Rs -/-/3 he took into consi deration only the cost of fuel and lubricating oil. 6. I agree that the price of current in Bahrain is high and that many people complain about the amount which they have to pay. From an electrical supply point of view Manamah is an unsatisfactory proposition and Muharra^ is even worse. It is said, rather vaguely, that there are 30,000 people in Manamah. I am doubtful about this myself. There are about 3000 houses and of them a large proportion are straw huts and many of the mud and stone houses in the centre and south of the town are inhabited by people so poor tnat the municipality from has great difficulty in collecting/them the very low minimum house tax of a few annas a month. If the price of electricity was a quarter of what it is now the majo rity of the population would be unable to afford to install it or to pay for current. wiring is now done byby local firms and there is competition but we do insist on O ood ..ork and we forbid the use of cheap and dangerous Japanese material. home years ago we tried to intro duce an instalment system to help poor people but the only people who availed themselves of it were not the poor. In any electric scheme the most profitable feature is a power load. This, in Bahrain, is practically non existent. In big cities like Karachi and Basrah — and both are far larger and I think more prosperous than Manamah and Muharrag — there is an unceasing power load for factories, water supply and sewage pumps, workshops, shop and dock lighting and machinery, such as cranes — at Basrah there are 15 electric travelling cranes and probably many more at Karachi. The Basrah power station belongs to the Port and is used chiefly for the Port’s operations which are mainly power load. The Port supplies current in bulk to the Municipality for the town but the supply of current to the town is a small propor tion of the load. Basrah town used to have its own supply from the old town power house, built by the army during the last war. It was, eventually, an inefficient affair and the cost of current was much more than it is now. In Karachi similar conditions exist but the port is larger and there are numbers of factories in the town. 8. Here for about five months of the year, during the whole of the day time practically no electric current is used. Until recently our power house closed down during the middle of the day but now we are running day and night owing to the needs of wireless stations and possible requirements of hospitals. It was economical to close in the day time. There are no local industries v/hose work requires electric power. At night during the cold v/eather current is used almost entirely for house lightinglighting. The bazaars in Bahrain are not open at night, shopkeepers go to their homes which are not in the bazaars. The shops,except a few Indian stores, close at sunset. The consumption of current on house lights is small. Street lights are turned off at 4 o’clock (arable time) and coffee shops are not allowed to keep open later. The Arabs on the whole go early to bed and the ft night life TT such as it is, takes place in barastis. The most profitable consumers during these times are the Europeans who sit up late and use more current than any other community* 9. During summer the position is different. With fans, air conditioning units, more use of refrigerators and water as well as lights the load is satisfactory* On certain occasions a peak load has been reached* It is essential that the power house should be capable of supplying the maximum at the same time it is necessary to have standby power of 100^ in case of a breakdown* There is no alternative supply which we could fall back on in case of a serious breakdown and though we keep a supply of spares, if an important part of the engine was damaged it would take many weeks, and under present conditions many months, to get replacements* We have a reserve of power in the new engine which could under take the work of the two old engines should an accident occur. 10* The original eletric supply-was for Manamah only but after it had been installed it was extended to Muharraq by submarine cable and distributed to parts of the town. Muharraq has never been a paying proposition it is a smaller and poorer town than Manamah and the use of electricity is confined mainly to steet lighting and a few houses. The cost of the Muharraq extension was about —about Rs 53,000/-. II• It may be suggested that our running costs are high, tnis suggestion is most likely to come from local merchants who have no means of 1 comparing our costs with those of similar undertakings elsewhere. Our running costs, which include wages, compare favourr ably with similar concerns elsewhere. Our figures are published every year in England and if you wish to see it I can send you details of numbers of other electric su PPly undertakings both at home and abroad. We receive them every year from the Diesel iiingine Users* association. 12. The biggest item on the expenditure side is the amount set aside for depreciation. On this point m took the advice of the firm of chartered accountants, Messrs Whinney murray, who audit all government accounts, includ ing the Electric Department, each year and also the opinion of electrical engineers. The percentage of depreciation varies considerably on different parts of the plant and the distribution services and I have thought that it errs on the light side. Last year depreciation amounted to Rs 29,000/-. This is a large amount but the life of metal, especially when exposed, is shorter in Bahrain than in most other places. 13. lull details of the financial position are shown yearly in the government annual reports. The accounts are verified and checked by the auditors. The original capital expenditure was £25,000. and it was provided partly by the government and partly by the two municipalities. Additional capital expenditure has been incurred such as the purchase of a new and larger engine. Do interest is charged on the capital. Eor the first four years we ran at a dead loss. Electricity had been installed when Bahrain was prosperous but immediately afterwards —afterwards the slump in the diving industry set in. During the last five years we have made a small profit. 14. Before the present war started the Bahrain government made an agreement to supply the Royal Air Force with electric current, in bulk, on Muharraq island. The Royal ixiv Force, with their experts, examined the whole matter and sent representatives to Bahrain. We offered them a sliding scale on terms which are available to any similar consumer taking current in bulk. The Royal Air Force was satisfied with our terms and made an agreement for 15 years guaranteeing a minimum monthly payment of Rs 750/-. In addition to this they decided to install a separate emergency supply at Muharraq to be used in case of emergency. The Royal Air Force could easily have installed an entirely independent unit for normal and emergency supply but they were satis fied with our rates and therefore made an agreement to take current from the Manamah power house. I feel that this shows that our rates are not unreasonably high for supplying large loads but unfortunately the people who use electricity in Bahrain do so on a small scale. 15. It has been suggested that the government ought to subsidise the electric supply but this, in my opinion, would not be a sound policy. Last year a reduction of 12i$ was made in the rates and I had hoped that a further reduction could be made this year. It is doubtful now whether this will be possible because owing to lighting restrictions street lights, pier lights and many outside lights are no longer used. The loss of revenue from these lights will amount to about Rs 8,000/- a year. This matter however will be considered before the end of the year.16, I enclose a copy of the sliding scale charges and a note on certain bulk consumers. Yours sincerely, Major R. G. E. W. Alban, G.B.E., H.b.M T s Political ^.gent, Bahrain.HUSAIN YATTCEMS ICE PLANT. Tills merchant imported a 25 k.w. generating set because he had some idea of running it intermittently in the winter for cold storage purposes, and was also under the impression that this would be cheaper than a supply from the Government on the sliding scale basis. The statement he gave to the Political Agent that he could generate a unit for J anna is nonsense, as the entirely disregards depreciation, insurance etc., and only refers to fuel and lubricating oil. His engine cost (at his own estimation) Rs. 13000/- plus erection etc., say a total of Rs.14000/-. Depreciation at 10$ per annum - Rs.1400/- whether the engine is running or not (it is idle during the winter months). Yateem consumed 40000 units in 1358, when he was getting a supply from the Government, and the average cost per unit to h im was annas 1.3. Rs.1400 divided by 40000 units make the price per unit generated £ anna in addition to fuel, oil, insurance and wages which would bring the price per unit to approximately 1 anna, disregarding the capital expenditure. A standby set should be installed as the supply of ice is a public service and should be guaranteed. Agency Electricity Costs . 1. When using their own plant :- In 1929 it would appear from records that the connected load was 2.5 k.w., i.e. 20 light points and six fans at the Agency and four light points and 2 fans in the Hospital. The Political Agent gives an average figure of Rs.1507/- for the annual cost over the period of years extehded from 1926 to 1930. The total consumption would be 2137 units (using the same ratio of consumption as at present). Therefore the cost per unit was approximately 11.3 annas. 2. On Government Supply :- During the period (December 1939 - November 1940) the total units consumed by the Agency was 9402 and the cost Rs.2948/- i.e., average cost per unit as. 5. The total connected load at present is 11.0 k.w. It would seem that the total connected load is about 4.5 times more than it was in 1929, but the cost per unit is less than half. For purposes of comparison I have assumed that if 11.0 k.w. of connected load consumes 9402 units, then 2.5.k.w. would consume approximately 2137 units.Sliding Scale of electricity charges in bulk 400 volts, 3/phase, 50 cycles, A.C. 0 - 1000 units per month - usual charges as per 1000 1500 n w Tt conditions of supply - 6 annas per unit. 1500 - 2000 n n Tt - 4 annas per unit. 2000 - 3500 Tt Tt n - 3 annas per unit. 3500 &amp; over TT Tt - 1 anna per unit.

The R.A.F. agreed to adopt the above scale of charges and to take a supply from the G-overnment for a period of 15 years with a guarantee of a minimum monthly payment of Rs. 750 /-.D.O • No • /f/f - ( iJ&amp;ted January, 1941 In replying to your demi-official letter No.1778/ $A-SE dated the 19th Jeccmber 1940 I want to explain that I am not concerned so much with what I myself pay (beyond of course the natural reluctance of any one to pay more than they think is due) but with what the worse off members of our British and Indian communities have to pay. The high cost of current prevents them from being able to provide cooling apparatus for their wives and children during the summer without which the blessing of electricity only means that a man can have some electric lights and a fan or two, instead of lamps and punkhas and at the rate of as. 7 per unit he cannot have much of these either. 2. As regards the native population, opinion has it that there are a number who would like to take current were it not for the high cost of current. But if a reduction were made in cost of current it seems probable that a much larger number of the public might become consumers. 3. The situation as it appears to me therefore is that electricity here as a real amenity i.e. to provide air con ditioning is only available to a small handful of the better off and even they have to look sharp lest their bills soar? to a somewhat larger number but still a handful it provides lights and fans while the population in general never see electricity except in the streets. I am sure everyone agrees that there is therefore a real necessity of finding out whether rates are toe high and if so of reducing them and thnt/- C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.- 2 - 1 A ^ l that the public are hard pressed and in need of every effort we can make on their behalf# 4# In my previous letter I made an important point of the difference in the total annual cost of running our own Agency plant 10 - 15 years ago and the charges we now pay to the # rtate Electric Department# The reason for taking this Agency was that we had had a plant and had some records of its expend!^ ture left and it would therefore afford a good illustration for our purpose which is to attempt to show that individuals would be better off with their own lighting plants than as consumers i from the State Electric Department and if this were so there could be no doubt that something had gone wrong with the communal plant which ought to be able to produce current cheaper than individual plantr could do it, 5# On figures supplied, I take lt t by the State Electric department you consider that this is not so and one argument is that as the Agency and Hospital had only 6 fans and 20 lights and 2 fans and 4 lights respectively and the then con sumption is estimated on the basis of the present known consumption and its ratio to the connected load# But there is no way of knowing the real number of units used by the Agency in those days since consumption depends not on the total number of lights etc# installed but on the length of time they are kept in use - and the tendency is to be more strict now owing to the high charges than was the case then when the engineer had to be paid any way -md the only extra cost was kerosene oil# 6. Some days ago I received a quotation from a contractor for supply of two suitable electric plants of a total capacity of 8.5 k/w which is considered ample to meet ell present requirements of this Agency and Hospital, both winter and sumrer f Vi a copy of which is attached, ■- 3 - Assuming Lhe initial cost of plant is correctly given the result is that if the Agency buys current costing Rs 3645/-p. (our last annual consumption was about Fs 3000/-) from the State Department it could produce the same quantity for Rs 843 - 12 - 0 per annum and the only items which appear to be omitted are (a) cost of power house, (b) pay of staff (c) spare parts and miscellaneous. As regards (a). We already have one. As regards (b). Our previous engineer cost r 600/- per annum and we can assume the same figure now. As re ards (c), With economy 250/- per annum might be expected to cover this. The total cost of current per annum might therefore be expected to work out at fc 844 Rs 600 Rs 250 Rs 1694 or Rs 1700/- per annum i,e, a saving of about Rs 1950/- on the assumed figure of Rs 3645 and a saving of Ps 1300/- on our present actual payments to the State of about Rs 3000/- • But even if the cost of plant were somewhat higher allowing for accessories etc,, it certainly appears to me that the Agency as a whole can provide its own prewent current requirements at less cost than the State can, 7, Alternatively Mr, Hussein Yateem has offered to supply rate of .4 as. per light and for A.C. the Agency electricity at a^/as, 2/- per unit^/from his 25 k/w plant which runs his ice plant and to instal a stand by plant as well - if the State will release him from the condition that he is not to sell his current to others, 8, The original idea in installing the present pov/er house appears to have been that the public should have electricity - not /-4 not that the State should have a Power House. One reason why the State owns it is, presumably, that in those days no merchants were capable of installing a power plant themselves, but now it looks as if there were a chance of private enter prise succeeding in producing cheap electricity in the same way as it has succeeded in producing abundant ice for the town where I think I am right in saying the State plant was not altogether a success. As regards the two annexures to your letter - Hussein Yateem’s ice plant - the immediate thought which occurs to one is that it must pay him more to produce his own current than to buy it from the State otherwise he would still be buying from the State* The statement in paragraph 5 that his ice engine is now idle during the winter months is not quite under stood as I am continually buying quantities of ice from him and anyway the proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof i.e. ice is being produced oomnercially and not with State electricity. Your paragraph 14. The acceptance of the bulk rates in Muharraq by the «oyal Air Korce is not really relevant since they do not cater for the general public and it is with electricity in as far as it affeets the latter that this letter has attempted to deal. been 10. Various reasons have/given as to why Basra and Karachi are able to charge lower rates than here - but has Kuwait been considered? There, I understand, a power station exists and supplies about 400 consumers with light at as. 6 per unit and refrigerators at as. 2. It has only been in existence 4 years or so. Surely if this can be done with 400 consumers and with about 6 years of depreciation still to pay off, the Bahrain station, after 10 years, with depre ciation practically paid off on the original plant and with 1339 consumers should be able to manage *tn a lesser rate than this. It is also to be remembered that oil fuel at Kuwait has to be imported from outside and cannot therefore be as cheap* as it is here. 11/-11 After considering all these points I honestly do not see how it is that charges for current cannot be reduced to as. 4 per unit for lights and fans and proportionately for other appliances and the plant yet pay its own way, unless of course there are too many consumers who get free current or that too much goes on maintenance charges. Possibly too many employees and at too high pay are being employed, depreciation also seems high as after 10 years the original plant must have been paid for. I should be grateful to know your further views in the light of the above. Yours sincerely, Sd/-R.G.E. , '. r .

M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.3^ 2/ NOTE ON ELECTRIC SCmP. The scheme was started eleven years ago. The municipalities shared in the scheme by paying 40$ of the capital which they paid in yearly instal- ments. The scheme was started with acapital of Rs.3,28,835/10/4. It worked at a loss for the first five years. The losses were;- 1349 R S . 26,986- 9- 3 1350 32,085- 5-10 1351 25,596- 6- 9 1352 26,671-13- 4 1353 19.983- 2- 0 '7.T,31,323- 5- 2 Thereafter the scheme showed small profits. The profits were;- 1354 Rs. 4,819-10-10 1355 17,657- 2-10 1356 9,300-10- 2 1357 12,198- 6- 6 1358 16.964-12-11 f~6Tj;w-ti-'3 The net loss in ten years therefore is Rs 70,382- 9-11. Capital Account. The capital started with wasRs.3,28,835/10/4. This amount represented the cost of machinery and distribu tion system installed for starting the scheme. When it was a running concern it was necessary to add to the system several additional equipment, which formed additional capital (or say investment) and which had to be paid for. The Government^ was compelled to advance to the scheme the required funds, which^it was then thought, could be repaid from future profits, but as the scheme was working at loss and there were no hopes of repaying the large amounts, the total value- 2 - © of such equipment was added to the capital. It items system Rs. 57,090-11- 0 80,686- 7-11 represented the following Extension to Distribution New Generating Set Additional items such as Engine spares Purifiers Coolers Tank Furniture Cars etc etc. Telephone system. A. C. Units. The capital of the scheme would be:- Griginal capital Additional system 37,831-15- 8 30,286- 8- 4 18.672- 4- 0 Rs72724^bo7-14--n at the end of ten years Rs.3,28,835-10- 4 Rs. 2,24,567t14-11 Rs. 5,53,403- 9- 3 machinery and system 9 0 0 6 0 2 9 2 2 Hence the capital at end of last year was Rs 3,19,771- 0- 0. See Balance Sheet. While starting any such commercial undertaking a capital is generally set aside, for an undertaking of the size of the Bahrain Electric Supply a capital of at least 10 lakhs would have been set aside, from this, all losses and depreciation would have been met, the 3/ less depreciation on the entire as follows:- Depreciation. 1349 1350 1351 1352 1353 1354 1355 1356 1357 1358 21,818-12- 22,473-14- 20,796- 0- 19,639-13- 19,087▼ 3- 17,072-15- 15,916- 9- 31,054- 3- 32,552-10- 34.239- 0-V - 3 - depreciation would then have been transferred in cash every year into an account called f, Sinking Fund'. If the life of the machinery was estimated at 10 years, in ten years time the Sinking Fund would pay for the cost of an entire set of new machinery. When the scheme was started the Government did not have enough funds to provide such a large capital to be paid in c)(ash, and as the scheme did not show enough profits the sinking fund account could not be opened. The Municipalities have not paid their shares in the additional capital, so either the shares of the municipalities will have to be reduced or they will have to be asked to pay in cash - the later is doubtful. The Bahrain Electric Supply differs from any other such commercial undertaking in that; this under taking is a Government concern and any losses, or additional capital (or in other words the cost of additional equipment) can be at once met by the Govern ment, without a Sinking Fund being set aside. A sinking fund can even now be opened provided the losses are paid in cash and provided the shares of the municipalities are recovered in cash. I * - ; ,t Y.G.Dated the 2dth January 1^41 D.O.

M f s Political Agent, Bahrain.Details of items in the Revenue Account called for in D.O, letter No, 204/6-3 dated 29th January 1941, from Major R,G.E,iV d Alban, n,B.M!s Political Agent, Bahrain, Paragraph 2, (i) Leave pay of State Engineer for Zi months Rs 2,500/-, The State Engineer earns 2i months leave for every year of service, as it is a legitimate charge on that particular year’s working of the department the amount is debited to 'Establishment Charges' and kept in reserve under 'Leave Reserve Account', The amount is paid to the State Engineer when ever leave is availed of. When the State Engineer goes on leave a substi tute is engaged. If the leave pay is not set aside every year there will be a very heavy expenditure under this heading during the year in which the State Engineer goes on leave, because both the leave pay and the pay and expenses of the substitute will be charged to that year’s account. Since the appointment of the Assistant State Engineer the State Engineer went on leave only once. His work was carried on by the Assistant State Engineer. (ii) Provident Fund for 6i months Rs 100/- - Rs 650. The new contract of the State Engineer was signed and came into effect 6i months before the close of the year. He was thus due 6i months 1 provident fund during the year. His previous contract did not entitle him to any provident fund. The provident fund is payable by the electric scheme^ ^ (iii) Residence. Rs 1,749/15. The State Engineer is residing in a house which isis the property of the Government• According to his contract he is to be provided with a free furnished house, the rent of which is a legitimate charge on the electric scheme* No rent has been charged* Repairs done to this building amounted to Rs 1749/15. The work was carried out by the Public Works Department. Because the repairs were carried out in a building occu pied by the State Engineer for which no rent was charged by the Government this charge was debited to the scheme direct. If this had not been met by the scheme a rental would have been debited to the scheme. The rent of the bungalow is estimated to be about Rs 150/- a month. During the last nine years the total cost of repairs thus charged to the scheme has amounted to less than Rs 2,000/-. The electric scheme has gained by the amount of rent which could have been charged during these nine years• (iv) Passages. - Rs 8,425/-. The State Engineer’s second term of service expired during the year 1358 and he was to have gone onJLeave during that year. Owing to the outbreak of war it was postponed until the following year. The passages which would have been payable in 1358 were then transferred and kept in reserve. The State Engineer is due 1st class return passage P &amp; 0 from Bombay to England for himself and his wife and 1st class Bahrain - Bombay. In addition the State Engineer is due an annual Indian passage 1st class Bahrain - Karachi and vice versa. According to his contract, this passage if he does not avail himself of it, can be accumulated towards his passage home. He was due three such Indian-3- Indian passages in 1358* The State Engineer had gone on leave two years ago and no passage was then paid. The sum of Rs 8 t 425/- represents the amount set aside in Tt Leave Reserve Account rT as follows Indian Passages. Prop9rtionate passages for the remaining part of the year — not payable until after further four years, but set aside in 'Leave Reserve Account' as follow:- Proportionate Indian nassage for 7 months @ Rs 538/- Rs 3; Proportionate U.K. passage This amount was set aside in the 'Leave Reserve Account as it would have had to be paid on the expiry of the State Engineer’s contract and was a charge which the scheme would have had to meet. (v) Rent of Electric Office — Es 1,200/-. The sum of fc 1,200/- is the rent of the Electric Office, stores, workshop and showroom. The landlord is His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad.

On the Revenue Account. (i) Generation - Kerosene, waste etc. Rs 5,338/3. This heading includes besides kerosene, waste etc. all miscellaneous expenditure incurred for or bearable by the Power House and should have been called 'Kerosene, waste and miscellaneous account'. Full details of these items of expenditure are given on list 'G'. The total amount of kerosene used was 373 gallons and price was As -/6/3 per gallon. Kerosene is used for cleaning parts of the engines and tools and for working the valves. (ii) Distribution. Materials used:- Maintenance of lines, copper wire, Insulators, brackets etc. Rs 5,790/- Material used for connecting new houses, wired by the dept. etc. Rs 2,425/12 Rs 8,215/12 Rs 5,790/-. Full details of the expenditure under this heading are given in list 'D' enclosed.936 lbs of copper wire were used. It is not possible to give the length in feet because copper wire comes in rolls of different lengths and the number of feet varies according to the gauge of the wire* The total cost was Rs 553/-. 3&gt;940 feet of Kaleeco and V.I.R. wire were used. It cost the department Rs 323 delivered at stores. Kaleeco and V.I.R. wires vary in prices according to sizes and cores. Rs 2,425/12. Full details of wire and other materials used for service lines are given in list n E n part I. The number of services connected was 227. (iii) Insurance premium Rs 2,557/3.

C/ 61 , 'dated the 18th January 1941, on the subject of the Bahrain State Electrical Departments 2. Before taking any drastic action against Steele it will be advisable to have seme facts and figures on which to base it. So long as we rely on Steele to produce them it is obvious that they will not emerge and as the matter is tech nical it is difficult for laymen to express an opinion however convinced one may be of his inefficiency. 3. I think the best way cf dealing with the matter will be as follows (a) The Oil Company should be approached confidentially and asked if they could spare an electrical engineer and, if necessary, an accountant, who would be capable of overhauling the Electrical Department and expressing an authoritative opinion as to its efficiency or the reverse, and make suggest ions for improvements in its working. ib) If they are prepared* to assist, you should inform Belgrave that the dissatisfaction of the Bahrain public with the Electricity Department has grown to a point where it reflects seriously on the administration, and that I would be glad if he would arrange for an expert or experts from the Oil Company to overhaul it and report on its administration. This investigation would naturally be at the expense of the Bahrain Government, and Steele would have to place himself and his office/ Major R.G # W. Alban, O.B.E. , Political Agent, Bahrain.A ■ ^ V -2 office at their disposal during the inquiry. (c) (i) If the inquiry disclosed such inefficiency that Steele’s removal would be justified^ (ii) you should ascertain privately from Furber whether he would be prepared to remain if he was given the post of state Engineer# An Indian assistant for the electrical side would probably meet all requirements for the present. id) If the answers to (c) (i) and (c) (ii) are in the affirmative* the question of giving Steele notice can be referred to me# If however Furber will not remain the matter will require further consideration as a European state Engineer will be hard to find in war time, end Steele is better than nothing# 4# Since the question of Steele's appointment was referred to the Government of India it will be necessary to make a reference to them before we can recommend that he be given notice# My personal opinion has always been that the retention of inefficient but well paid Europeans in States under our control is a great mistake and has serious political re percuss i ons. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Weightman, and have already sent him copies of your above mentioned letter and your Printed Letter No*71-6/13 of the 13th January 1941 and its enclosures# Yours sincerely.This /- Confidential Review of the working of the Electric Department and Retrenchment Proposals * !• The capital cost of the scheme from the beginning is Rs. 5^ lakhs and the balance remaining after charging depreciation is Rs. 3,20,000/-. The capital cost seems to have been far too high for a small place like this where the essentials require# are simply the engines and dynamos to produce electricity, wires to carry it to destinations and a few men to attend to the machines and wires. 2. The amount of extras ordered and the cost of these is tremendous. For instance, no less than Rs. 77,438/- was spent in '4 building the power house the life of which is estimated at only 30 years. A much more simple affair of coral rock and cement would have sufficed at a probable cost of between ten and fifteen thousand rupees. From the list of original costs of various articles, it at once appears that the State has been run into enormous expence over labour costs. The costs are not shown separately but they have increased the cost of articles out of pro portion to the other items. For instance, the power house costs Rs. 77,438/- while two engines only cost Rs. 75,145/-. These did not need much labour in comparison with the power house. Again, high tension and low tension feeders, overhead lines, underground cables, etc., all show enormous figures which cannot be due to the cost of wire and poles. They must have been swelled by labour. As a result of the revaluation which has just taken place, the consumers have apparently to repay something like Rs. 40,000 on account of the depreciation this year. This seems a very high figure and there appears to be some doubt as to the exact amount of depreciation charged. 3. Of the total expenditure of Rs. 1,64,683/- we see that no less than 64,000 rupees is spent on establishment charges.This seems to be a very heavy figure indeed. Of this amount Rs. 25,324/- is paid to the State Engineer alone, and Rs.35,677/- is the pay of other employees. These employees number 60 altogether, of whom 12 are Indians. The pay of these Indians is much higher than the pay of the Bahrainis and provision has to be made for house rent, passage to Karachi and leave salary for these individuals. The cost of miscellaneous articles used for cleaning the engines is Rs. 5,338/- and appears to be very excessive; in equal to fact, it is very nearly^the cost of fuel used in the engines. v Too much kerosene, cotton waste, copper wool, petrol and oil (in particular) is used. The item daily workmen for pumping oil, general repairs, etc., Rs.488/- seems particularly high. Rs. 43,298/- for such spare parts as bolts, rings, washers, etc., is not understood, as engine spares to the value of £ 1,875/- are already in stodk. I think that with care this item could safely be reduced by 50 %. The item / distribution maintenance Rs. 5790/- ; seems very high. This item is merely cost of repairing poles and lines taking the electricity to various quarters and should not be anything like this figure. Copper wire lasts between 10 and 15 years at the most conservative estimate and actually, of course, could probably go on for 20 or 25 years. One would have thought therefore, that a fef*' hundred rupees a year would have covered the cost of maintaining these wires^ That i-e, occasional poles blown down during a winter gale or patching a defective piece of wire. Two or three men would seem to be quite sufficient for this work. I* extremely dubious of this account. Distribution service Rs. 2425/-. This appears to be material used for bringing current up to new houses wired during the year. The account does not include any poles and I presume that houses were so close that the wire could be taken from existing /-I /- - 3 - existing poles. The cost therefore for putting out a few lengths of wire together with brackets, insulators etc., seems very high. The amount of Hs. 1616/- spent on the upkeep of three motor cars seems high for annual expenditure. I have owned a car for many years now but have never spent as much as Rs. 500/- on mere upkeep each year. It appears as if cars had undergone extensive refitting. The item Rs. 441/- on account of labourers is not understood as there is already a large permanent staff xhBx of 60 individuals who could have done this work. 4. I am not at all satisfied about the expenditure. The staff appears to be far too numerous and far too many Indians are employed. The pay of Indians plus passage and rent amounts to Rs. 17,350/- alone. Power house staff consists of 12 men costing Rs. 11,654/- of whom the five highest paid are Indians. Their pay alone amounts to Rs. 7,799/-. I suggest that the power house is overstaffed and that two Indians, one foreman and one assistant foreman or fitter, would be sufficient, the rest being returned to India at once. The powers house staff will then be r educed to nine men, which seems a much more reasonable number, and the salary will then be reduced from Rs. 11,654/- to Rs.74^/. Passages and house rent will also be reduced accordingly. To have such a large office for a comparatively modest under taking is hard to justify and the numbers could, (and should, I think) be drastically reduced. seems no justification for employment of any of these Indians since Bahrainis must have learned the work after 10 years. The telephone staff is about right. The office staff consists of 14 men Wiring staff consists of 30 men Six are Indians, whose salaries are Rs.^iVf/. Thereannas to six annas per unit. (which /- N#B. The Assistant State Engineer should easily be able to cope with the additional work as he has, I understand, already been doing so during the absence of Mr. Steele and in any case his oil guaging duties do not fully occupy his time. He would of course have to receive additional pay for the additional work on the same basis as when he was previous ly acting. (ii) The Assistant Engineer immediately on taking over to draw up a comprehensive budget for electricity and the telephone Department to include (a) dismissal of nearly all the Indian employees except those who are holding key posts, (b) the retrenchment of what seems excessive personnel in the office establishment and wiring staff, (c) strict economy on the expenditure on other items, that is, upkeep of cars, miscellaneous generation charges, distribution maintenance, distribution service and upkeep of telephones. He should also consider whether the depreciation of any items of xjb machinery etc. can be extended over a long / period. (iii) Subscribers have to pay rent on a large number of current consumed by lights, refrigerators, power etc. The charge amounts to -/8/- as. a unit and is quite heavy. The system also lends itself to cheating as a person has only to fit a plug into the -/2/- anna power point in order to be able to use current for lighting and other purposes which could cost -/?/- as. at present. Clerks have also to go round reading metises every month. If a flat rate per unit for all household purposes, say 2 annas per unit, were intro- t duced, each house would only require one meti^e, the number of clerks could be reduced and there would be no loss of revenue electric meti^s in each house.1 - 6 - (Which I am sure is occurring) through persons using power points for lighting, etc. Bahrain 15th February 1941.

Dear Mr. Belgrave, In accordance with your request of February 22, 1941, to Mr. Lipp and his answer of the next day, we now submit the written reports of the Committee which was appointed to make a study of the Bahrain Government Electrical Supply Department operations. Part I of this report deals with the financial aspects of the enterprise and has the following statements attached:- A. Profit &amp; Loss Statement (By Sections) per Govt, books (10 yrs.) 1349 - 1358. A-1,2,3 Establishment Charges &amp; Distribution. B. Profit k Lose Statement (Adjusting A). B-l Miso.

Depreciated Value per cent from 1 to 20 years on Straight-Line Method vs. Fixed Percentage on Declining Balance. Since neither the company nor the members of the committee wish to compete or enter in any way into the field of public accounting, it has been decided to charge no fees for the services rendered in connection with the present study. We hope that your questions have been answered and that the statecnants, schedules and exhibits furnished will enable you to make the necessary changes in policies and rates. In case you wish to experiment with other rates we shall also hand over to you our working papers on energy bills for the year 1359. In conclusion the committee feel that special consideration of the following points might be most helpful in improving the present situations- 1 (1) The activities of the Bahrain Government would seem to justify the services of a good accountant with commercial experience, part of 1*1 ose time could be devoted to good advantage to the accounts of the various sections of the Electrical Supply Dept.3 - (2) A budgetary System should be introduced in order to properly plan and control (3) All spares should be carefully stored (4) An adequate costing system should be adopted. (5) Depreciation would be more satisfactorily treated by Straight-Line-&amp;ethod for several reasons. (6) Municipalities should be charges As.5 per unit with a guaranteed minimum. (7) An investigation should be made for the purpose of reducing overhead and operating costs from 1360 onwards; time checks should be introduced and expenses &amp; sundry costs be carefully watched k compared from month to month. (8) Rate reductions either as recommended or as modified should be instituted as soon as possible. If found inadequate they could be changed as required until they have been proven satisfactory from the standpoint of income. They should be We should like to thank the clerks in your office and the State ISngineer's office for their co operation in answering questions or furnishing data to the best of their ability. expenditures in an orderly manner purchases should be carefully considered and issues watched. tried for a sufficient period to prove their adequacy. (9) Some subsidy might be in order for the Muharraq scheme which does not pay its way. (10) A set of operating standards, accounting procedures and a letter of policy would be of advantage.- 4 - To comply with your request of last Thursday, the committoe has been somewhat rushed to prepare the final reports for use today. Due to the necessary brevity of the reports under the circumstances, it will be advisable to discuss the statements and exhibits with the committee this morning.3AretAlK SL^STRIC UTILITY ,1, riKViiClAX Tlii* report is not intended to be a criticiem of the accounting procedures followed by the Bahrain &gt;ov'sraaeat* neither of Its operating policy as regards the Ueotrleal roheae.

An analysis of any utility scheme quite naturally falls under two general classifications, namely, financial and technical, and the problem has therefore been segregated in this manner. Part I of this report has, together with Exhibits, dealt primarily with the accounting and financial phases, whereas in the section to follow the engineering and technical aspects are dealt with. While the writer would hardly attempt to qualify as a utility rate or operating structure analyst a request for comments and suggestions on the Bahrain Utility has been accepted and the comaents and sugges tions which follow are what is hoped to be a fair and unbiassed resume of information which has been developed during the rather limited period involved in this study. It would appear that the engineering considera tions are largely to analyze the various facts which enter into the cost and distribution of power and in conjunction with the financial analysis to present facts and figures to substantiate any revision in rate structures that may be suggested. Numerous factors enter into theteotmioal side of the problem, but they may be grouped under general headings and will be taken up in that order: 1. Plant Investment 2, Grenerating &amp; Distribution Costs 3. Depreciation 4, Electric Energy Rates &amp; Schedules. PLANT HNl3T:zn! : The relative magnitude of the original capital outlay and that involved in subsequent plant additions, has an important bearing on the question of rates, since the total investment determines the amount to be annually set aside from operating revenues for plant depreciation. In fact, the high first cost of the Bahrain plant and distribution system per unit of capacity requires that a substantial amount must be annually set aside for depre ciation over and above what might be considered the normal amount for a system of its size. This condition is brought out to partially substantiate the relatively high fixed charges which must be met from operating revenues ( to cover depreciation and insurance, but obviously nothing can be done to rectify this condition at this late date. In this connection it must be pointed out that the records show that although a number of concerns were asked to bid on the project only one did so and those responsible for placing the contract had to accept this figure if them - 3 - ✓ project was to go forward. The contractor, no doubt, quoted a figure high enough to protect him against any eventualities and added costs involved in erecting and placing the scheme into operation in Bahrain where only very limited facilities were available. The relatively small size of the original generating units partially accounts for the high first oost per unit of generating capacity and if and when a large addition is 'Bade a marked reduction in oost per unit capacity over that of the original plant will no doubt be evident. This is illustrated by a comparison of the original plant unit oost with that of the 135? addition. Original Plant : Building &amp; Foundations RSe 66 # 419- 0- 0 2 - 150 H.P.

Rs. 9,371- 0- 0 72.449- 0-0 Installed Capacity Cost Rs.409/- per unit. In general it may be said that the generatin and distribution system is almost elementary in its sim- plioity and no equipment not absolutely essential to its successful operation has been included. In fact, as - ,© - 4 - th« system load increases and load swings of greater magnitude become prevalent the addition of generator j voltage regulators would be highly desirable if not absolutely essential to continued satisfactory opera ting stability, GISNiSRATINCr &amp; DISTRIBUTION 003T3 : Fuel and lubricating oil costs per unit generated appear to be ri^t for a plant of this size. The exceedingly low average daylight load consisting largely of transformer and line losses tends to increase the fuel and oil consumption per unit sold; so the present costs appear entirely reasonable for existing load condi tions. Wages and maintenance materials per unit produced are also in line with the expectancy for the existing load conditions. While there is no doubt that a considerable increase in plant output could be maintained with the existing operating personnel, still the present personnel is about the minimum which can cover all three shifts and properly service the equipment. Fixed charges and management overhead are relatively high. Plant investment and resultant in surance and depreciation charges are high and will be later discussed in more detail. Management salaries and expenses are disproportionately high largely because the existing staff could, no doubt, supervise and direct a much more comprehensive system with many times present energy sales over which the management and other iixedcosts might be distributed* Air Conditioning rental soheise has shown a consistent lossg but since it is now being abandoned there is no need in discussing this point further* PmaCIATIOK l Here it is sufficient to say that the straight line zaethod is not only more straight-forward but it depreciates the equipment evenly over its life instead of over-burdening the early years of plant operation with most of the depreciation* Ordinarily, because of added plant load, a utility in its later years is in a more favourable position to pay off depreciation than in its early years. Curves on 2xhibit 5 attached, graphically illustrate the major difference in these two methods of taking plant depreciation* A physical inspection of lines, kiosks, trans former substations and of the generating plant itself indicates all equipment has been well maintained and is at present in excellent condition* Assuming that present maintenance standard is continued there is little likeli hood that the equipment would become unserviceable before the depreciation parted indicated* In some cases, because of rapid change or new inventions, it is found advantageous to increase depre ciation rates and replace equipment before its useful life has been fully utilized* Sleotrical generating and distribution equipment and engines have become re-lativoly well standardized and the existing equipment oan in all probability be economically utilized through out the anticipated life period, BL3CTRIC RAT2S ! In making a study of the Bahrain Slectrio rate structure the outstanding features appear to be the ex tremely wide spread in rates between the small consumer and the large consumer; and the numerous meters required in order to make billings according to, what would appear to be, an unnecessarily complicated rate structure. After a study of local rate structure and comparing it with that of Basra and Karachi, the rates here seem too severely biassed in favour of the large consumer and, therefore, we oan only conclude that the small consumer boars a dis proportionately large share, if not all, of the fixed charges and operating overhead. For instance, the mini mum air conditioning rate enjoyed by consumers at Basra - iuoa larger utility — is Ans.2 Ps .2 per unit as compared to anna one in Bahrain. (We take as our authority for rates in Karachi and Basra the rates set forth in Major * r Alban’s letter D.O.#2286-6/13 to Mr. C.D. Belgrave). A study of the financial and operating structure of the Bahrain utility indicates no justification for a rate as low as one anna other than as a direct and perhaps unwarranted subsidy to the large power consumer. tfhile we have made a fairly comprehensive study of the financial structure and operation of the Electricutility, it should be fairly evident that our knowledge of existing social and political conditions is compara tively limited and therefore we ask the readers’ indul gence if some of our comments or suggestions may appear to be impractical because of conditions peculiar to Bahrain In setting up the proposed rate schedules which are later discussed in detail and which are illustrated on Exhibits 1, 2 &amp; 3, a comprehensive study of the utility sales and income for the Arabic year 1359 has been made. The sample rates are set up on what appears to us to provide an equitable distribution of charges between the small and the large consumer commensurate with a return for power sales sufficient to make the scheme self-sus taining according to our detailed study of the financial structure. Briefly, the minimum energy charges to large consumers are increased to bring the return up to what we consider is the cost of production and a portion of plant amortization. This would affect few, if any, power users since most of them are below the total consumption where the minimum charges begin to take effect except in the case of large consumers of energy for air conditioning who would experience a slight increase in energy cost. Total billings to the intermediate consumers would pro bably average slightly below the present. According to our analysis, we believe it is feasible to reduce the rate to the small consumer from 7 annas to 6 annas and have built up a rate for illustration based on annas 68 In the discussion to follow references and comparisons will be drawn with the utility rate structures in existanoe at Basra and Karachi. No study of the finan cial or operating organizations of these utilities were obtainable but obviously each of these systems is much larger than that of Bahrain and they can, no doubt, produce and sell energy at a profit at a much lower minimum figure, still in certain brackets the consumer in Bahrain enjoys a substantially lower rate than does the consumer in Basra. In attempting to set up a rate structure proba bly a good starting point is to establish some minimum figure at which under existing conditions of power sales, fixed charges, overheads, fuel costs and operating charges, power can be sold at a profit. This figure should then provide a foundation for building up a firm rate structure. MINIMUM DISTRIBUTED JlirSRQY C03T : It is quite evident that with increasing power sales, with everything else being equal, the cost of pro ducing and distributing ener ;y decreases and it is there fore adbantageous to build up the plant load in order to lower the rates. The danger in this procedure is, how ever, that if in the effort to build up the load the mini mum rate is set at a figure which does not include a fair share of the operating and fixed charges the small consumer may have to continue to bear a disproportionately large share of these charges over an extended period of time. This would appear to be the case here and probably theload must increase to the point where another generating unit is required before the volume of power sales will be such as to actually justify a rate as low as one anna per unit* While it might be contended that the low mini- mum rates for air conditioning and energy for power hare been largely instrumental in building up loads and conse quent income to present levels t one cannot help but wonder if perhaps the same result might not have been achieved without setting the minimum below the cost of production* (Note Basra’s A.O. rate of As.2 Ps.3 per unit). As will be later discussed in more detail a higher minimum does not necessarily raean a higher average electric rate except to a very few large consumers but it will protect the utility from eventually distributing a large volume of power at a rate which does not bear its fair share of the production costs or that of making plant additions re quired to meet the increased demands. Ultimately power can, and no doubt will, be profitably sold for a minimum of one anna or even less, but in attempting to build up too rapidly, the rates of low cost power to the lighting or high coat power becomes disproportionately large and if the minimum rates for large power are below the pro duction cost the small consumer must continue to bear all of the burden of overhead and fixed charges. In attempting to set up a minimum rate it seems generous enough to assume that with the existing plant and distribution facilities twice as much energy could be sold before plant additions becO^a# necessary. If thisassumption is considered reasonable then the minimum rate may be shaded by including only 1/2 of the existing out~of-pocket operating costs, depreciation and insurance in arriving at a minimum figure for energy cost. Then the minimum cost should be based on:- 1* All of the out-of-pocket cost for fuel oil, lubricating oil and water. 2. 1/2 of existing operating wages, depreciation and insurance. A minimum built up in this manner follows: Units sold in 1359 Depreciation taken on Straight line basis Insurance Fixed Charges Unit Coats: 376.980 KWH .

The adjusted figure of As. 1.25 per unit, we believe, represents the absolute minimum for which power should be sold under present conditions. Frankly we can see little point or justification in attempting to build1 up the plant load and the eventual requirement for addi tional generating and distributing capacity with power sales at a figure below that which fulfills the economic requirements outlined above. P0V/3R SCHSDULfl : Large utilities ordinarily set up a number of power schedules to cover various classes of consumers. However, here in Bahrain the field is rather limited and it is believed that two schedules might be drawn up to cover, for the present at least, all types of consumers. In order to charge the power consumer what might be con sidered a rental fee for the generating and distributing facilities maintained to serve his load, a majority of power schedule are drawn up with a monthly minimum charge per horsepower connected and the cost per unit declines with additional units consumed per contract horsepower connected rather than on a straight unit consumption basis. In this manner installations of unnecessarily large, in frequently used motors with their resultant disturbing effects on the power system are not only penalized but they also pay a fair share towards the upkeep of the system whether they use power or not. The power con sumer who enjoys a marked reduction in rates for power should expect to pay a reasonably monthly minimum per horsepower connected. Note the Karachi power schedule Exhibit #3 attached. While a schedule of this type may at first thought appear to involve unnecessary complica tions for a small system such as Bahraini, a littlereflection will show it to be simple in application and it will also be realized that some schedule of that sort is essential in order to avoid the undesirable conditions arising from the application of schedules such as now en joyed by 'Cable &amp; Wireless' and by the consumers of power for air conditioning. A brief examination of the bulk rate power cost curve (.Exhibit #1) and the air conditioning power cost will show that by deliberately wasting energy the consumer may bring about a very substantial reduction in his total billing. Whenever a customer’s billing on the present bulk rate schedule exceeds Rs.325/- per month he can begin to make substantial savings by immediately wasting 3000 units of energy per month to bring him into the one anna per unit bracket. Obviously such a rate is economically unsound even though present consumers may be above taking advantage of the situation, the point is that the opportunity to do so does exist. However, it is understood that the bulk rate is given only on a yearly contract and can therefore be amended at the expiration of any period. 3eoondly the bulk schedule encourages the sale of energy at a rate which we believe is below the cost of production and fair share of plant amortization and will ultimately require plant expansion to meet un profitable load demands. While most power rate schedules are in fact set up on a sliding scale of energy cost they are so arranged, as will be obvious from an examination of the Karachi, or the proposed Bahrain power rate curves (Exhibit #2) that- 13 while the rate per unit consumed is reduced with each incremental increase in consumption the total revenue to the utility continues to increase with increasing consumption. The volume of energy sold for power pur poses continues to increase and this would appear to be an opportune time to set a power schedule which, while it could be modified as conditions warranted would never theless provide an equitable billing basis from the stand point of both the consumer and the utility. An example of a proposed Bahrain power rate schedule starting at annas 4 per unit and declining to annas 1.25 per unit for all power over 500 units is illustrated on Exhibit #2. It is believed that this rate or a modification of it might be successfully applied to all classes of power consumers in Bahrain. It will be noted that in the proposed rate, only the minimum monthly charge is based on the connected horsepower but under present conditions it should suffice. When the size and number of power consumers begins to grow then a bracketed rate all based on connected iorse— power may be added. The rate illustrated would be simple in application and still would overcome the main objections to the existing bulk rate. AIR CONDITIONING RATS SCHSPULS ; The existing air conditioning rate schedule is open to the same general objections as the bulk power schedule is, namely, under certain conditions the consumer may obtain a substantial reduction in billing by deli-berate!/ wasting energy and secondly by increased con sumption a one anna rate is enjoyed which in our opinion is unprofitable to the utility. Under the present conditions it appears quite feasible to sell energy for air conditioning on the same basis as for power and a comparison of this rate with the existing rate and those of other oonsaunities is shown on Sxhibit 2. While the rate appears to be somewhat higher for the small consumer of energy for air condition ing it probably will average about the same as the present rate because the first bracket of the suggested rate in cludes the energy consumed for refrigerator and water pumping which is at present separately metered and paid for on a 4 anna basis. The large consumer definitely pays a higher average rate on account of the minimum being set at As. 1.25 per unit instead of As.l which is consi dered to be below the cost of production. A brief study of sheets 1 h 2, Exhibit #4, will reveal the relative complexity of the Bahrain rate struc ture as compared to that of the muoh larger utilities of Basra and Karachi. For instance in view of the fact that the small consumer is recuired to pay As.7 per unit for energy consumed it would appear that the utility is show ing excessive consideration in other brackets in establish- reduced ing a separate^rate for a few owners of certain refrigera tors because they happen to have relatively low freezing efficiency as compared to the usual electric refrigerator.15 The proposed rat© has the additional advantage of combining in one schedule four different services that are now separately metered. This must result in an appreciable increase in clerical labour over what would be required if these services were combined. The rate which is offered for consideration may not after further study meet all of the requisites but it Is believed that it can be modified to adequately combine the several rates and billing schedules now in force for power, air condi tioning, refrigeration and heating. iiaHTma rats jci-xiSDULg : The bulk of the utility income is now derived from energy sold for lighting and before suggesting any change in rate careful consideration was given to the financial structure and the effect of any rate change in this bracket along with the effect of the changes proposed in the power and air conditioning rates. This was done by making a fairly comprehensive analysis of the 1359 energy sales and costs modified in accordance with our suggestions. The reduction in income effected is offset by the reduced depreciation indicated on the straight line basis, and by the substantial portion of charges for the State ifinginee^s salary and expenses which it is believed should be absorbed by the Bahrain Government. These data are all analised and substantiated in the financial balances presented with the accounting section of the report. The proposed rate reduction was arrived at onlyafter all operating charges. Insurance, depreciation and a reasonable sinking fund allowance were taken out of the operating income, and therefore if the business of the Arabic year of 1359 just completed, upon which the analysis was based is considered a normal one, then we believe the proposed reductions may be safely considered. A comparison of lighting schedules together with the one (As.6) proposed is indicated on Exhibit 3, and while the proposed rate is still well above that enjoyed by the consumer in Basra or Karachi it is believed to be the maximum reduction which can be safely effected at this time. It is proposed to continue the present As.5 rate to the Municipalities since their relatively low rate of consumption does not appear to warrant any rate concession. Furthermore, any reduction given to the Municipalities would only revert back and have to be borne largely by the small consunisr; so until the Municipalities show a sub stantial increase in consumption they should in all probability pay for energy at the present lighting rate.kxhipit 4 Sliest Q0MPARATIV5 ELECTRIC RATES KUWAIT ?

No. C/326 Sated the 14th April 1941. 9 n ^ I have had time now to go through the report of the Comraittee on the working of the State Electric Deportment. 2. To take their recommendations one by one i- (1) They recommend the engaging of a good resident accountant. In the discussion with Colonel Prior it was agreed that you would approach Messrs. Ferguson or some other firm of chartered accountants in India to arrange this and also annual inspections. (2) A detailed operating budget should be introduced in order to properly plan and control expenditure. It is strange f to say the least y that no budget is being prepared - but I hope that one will be got out for the year 1360 as early as possible. This budget would presumably estimate to the last detail every item of fuel, lubricant, cleaning material, spares f replacements, labour etc. etc. required for running each unit of the plant during the next year. P and L account and Balance Sheet for 1359 have been made out py the Committee 9 so the Electric Department is relieved of this work for this year; it will of course be essential to bring out these statements at the end of this year and*in future to prevent a relapse. I should be grateful for two copies of the budget in due course* (3) It appears that spares are not properly stored and are not kept in an orderly sta.e 9 purchases of fresh articles are not considered carefully and issdes are not being watched. As these spares are valued at over fc 14 9 000/- it is obvious that they should be carefully C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government. kept /-kept on shelves y ticketed and protected against damp* The room should also be kept locked and no issues made except with the State Engineer* s authority against an entry in the stores ledger* This is the procedure in every power house, garage, etc* where a large number of spares are kept. It appears also that purchases have been made without careful consideration as to whether they are likely to be wanted. Some of the parts are very costly and there seems little doubt that most of these spares will still be unused when the engines finish their life* (4) It is the opinion of the Committee that an adequate costing system should be adopted* A costing system will enable the State Engineer to tell almost exactly what it has cost to produce and sell every unit of electricity, it would also show the cost of working each engine and be a check on the amount of labour employed* (5) Depreciation* The Committee consider the straight line method to be better as it depreciates the equipment evenly over its life instead of overburdening the early years* Last year the amount charged was Fs 29,418/- and during his recent visit Madams, your chartered accountant, for some reason raised this figure to around Rs 40,000/-* The Committee consider that the public have been overcharged to the extent of over Rs 70,000/- since the scheme began. Under the straight line method (Ex. F*2-3 and Ex.5) the annual depreciation v/ill only amount to Rs 25,000/- I hope this method will be adopted - it will go some way towards meeting the criticisms of the public. There appears to be no suggestion that the overcharge of Rs 70,000/- should be set off•against future depreciation and the charges thus further reduced*' r*-./ . ( 6 ) The Committee recommend that Municipalities should be charged as. 5 per unit with a guaranteed minimum. I should /-should be glad to know the minimum charge so fixed* (7) This is probably the most important item of all* It requires an investigation for the purpose of reducing overhead and operating costs from 1360 onwards 5 expenses and sundry costs to be carefully watched and compared from month to month* It is not stated who is to carry out this investigation; the only way I can see would be to hire a competent official from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The findings of the Committee have been based on the figures as supplied to them by the Electric Department and the accuracy of the findings therefore depends on the accuracy or otherwise of the figures. ( 8 ) The Committee recommend that rate reductions should be instituted as soon as possible as set forth in Sx. 4 sheet 3 and graphs 1 to 3* It should be remembered however that all the findings of the Committee are dependent upon the accuracy of the figures supplied to them by the Electric Department vide page 1 Part I of the Report. If therefore the figures of expenditure given to the Committee were too high their recommendations for rates are likely to be too high* I agree with their proposal that as. 6 should be charged for lighting - there is no ^ention of fans - but it seems rather excessive to double/charge for air condition ing etc. from as. 2 fcp to as. 4 per unit for the first 100 units per month. As. 3 per unit i.e. a.rise of 60% for the first 100 units would seem more reasonable. (9) The Committee recommend a subsidy to support the Muharraq Scheme. Another way of easing this incubus might be for the State to take over the Muharraq extension and make no charge for depreciation against the Electric Scheme.« - 5 - car. The aura is practically equal to the depreciation and means that the consumer at the end of 4 years will have paid the cost of two cars - once by depreciation and once through repair charges • I think this should not be allowed - about 2% of the capital cost might be a more usual figure i.e. say Ks 240/- per annum. I understand that this car has been handed over to Dr* L!acDorell and that the State Engineer has taken over I*r. Furber* s car* This seems somewhat irregular since the Scheme has capitalised the value of the old car and paid depreciation and repairs for it* It would seem at least fair for the State to refund a proportionate amount of the money spent on repairs to the Electric Scheme. It should also be watched that the Scheme is not charged depreciation be%rond the original period - four years I believe. The other three cars of the Electric Depart ment also seem to have had an extensive refit, as they about cost the public/538/15 each in repairs during the year. I suggest the same figure i.e. Rs 240/- per annum should be the limit for them also It is difficult to see why the State Engineer 1 s car should have cost so much more than the other cars to maintain. 6 . In well run garages a log book for each vehicle 1 is maintained. This shows every journey, mileage, petrol issued, spare parts, renewals etc, with dates. At the end of each month petrol and oil is totalled and average miles per gallon worked out. This is a rough check on issues of petrol to make sure that drivers do not make away with it. I presume these are being kept up for each of the cars in question. 7. Debtors. According to the Balance Sheet for 1358 (Ex.C) the amount outstanding against Deb^ofs was Rs 43,019/1/8, at/-i 6 at the end of 1359 (Ex.F) this amount had been reduced to Rs 27,671/9/5. It is hoped that a further reduction has now been made. In this connection perhaps you could let me know how the investigation over the burning of the Electric Department account books is proceeding. I understand that the ledgers were too thick to have burnt without assistance. 8 . I presume that you have already written to Bombay about the chartered accountant and that the other recom mendations of the Committee are being taken in hand.

Whether that is any reason for a similar practice in Bahrein I do not know. It seems to me very contrary to all normal costing ano accounting practice both in Government departments and in private firms.

I have made enquiries in regard to candidates for your waiting list pnd the Manager of the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation is able to recommend one very good candidate, but he suggests that you might t liKe to interview him when you arrive in Karachi. I would, however, be grateful if you could give me further details in regard to service in Bahrain so that I can ma^e further enquiries. In regard, to your second letter I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Mrs Wright, the Manager of the plectric corporation which,I thinfc, wall be helpful toElectric House, Kar chi, i6th April 1941. Dear Trotman, Many than.cs for your note of to-day. In these days it can hardly be said to be customary to allow free electric current to the private bungalov/ of an employee of an electricity Undertaking. It used to be con sidered good policy to do sc to selected senior employees in order that their unrestricted use of electlicty would encourrge others to use electricity adequately. It is no: r realized that the ^ublic soon learn that the electri city is f:ee and. the advertising value is lost. Occasionally a senior employee housed in the Company's bung* low in the Power Station compound is allowed free' electricity as part compensation for his having to stay in the compound which is generally not as congenial as a. bunga low in the residential district. 'Then granted, free electricity is part of the employee's iy• Accordingly, it is part of the teims of engagement oi the employee. An employee whose terms of engagement dg not include free elect ricity is net entitled to it merely on the argument that it is customary. In the case ct our own Station engineer, who lives in the Station Com]ound» free electricity for lighting and fans (not for refrigerator) is granted as one of the written terms ©f his service agreement. All our other employees (who live outside the station Compound) pay the same rates as other consumers for electricity. I trust this information may cove your requirements. Yours etc: Sd/- H.

Trotman f Ksq. t Collectors House, Karachi.I GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN, D.O. Mo. /v . V Bahrain, May 10, 1941* fjr b Dear Alban, I am sorry 'to have been so long answering your letter C/326 dated 14th April 1941 in which you sum marise some of the findings of the committee which surveyed the electric department. As suggested by Colonel Prior I wrote to Collins about chartered accountants but I have not yet received his reply. I am sending two copies of the budget for I860. Running costs are reviewed monthly when the allocations of time, material etc. are made under different headings. The station log sheets show the daily consumption of fuel, oil etc. in the same way as vehicle log books, both of which are kept. I discussed the question of spares with the com mittee. They said emphatically that we were not carrying too big a stock, especially for present day conditions. It was not suggested by the committee that most of the spares will be unused when the engines finish their life. I presume you assumed this to be implied by the last paragraph of page 5 of the engineer ing report. I questioned the meaning of this para graph myself. The first sentence refers to electri cal inventions in general and is not intended to apply directly to Bahrain. A new costing system can be introduced if a new accountant is obtained, the run ning costs at present are known and are frequently referred to in the report.fte have adopted the straight line method of depreciation, it is mainly by doing this that the reduction in lighting rates was made possible. I hope that it will be possible to make further reduc tions later on but this must depend upon the result of the year’s working. It would be unwise to reduce the rates and then to be compelled to raise them again. In order to reduce the rates the plant has been written up at a value higher than its actual market worth today and alterations have been made in certain allo cations. The adjustment has been made possible because the plant has been well looked after. The new system is satisfactory as long as the undertaking runs smoothly but if it were ever necessary to dis pose of some of the plant it is improbable that it would fetch the price at which it now stands in the books. If the plant sustained any serious damage replacement costs would be heavy. Since the war began costs have increased by almost 100$. So far however we have been fortunate in this respect and no big replacements have been necessary. Manamah Municipality has been asked to pay a minimum amount of Rs 156/4 (500 units) per month in return for obtaining current at 5 annas a unit. I will enquire from the committee what form of 'investigation' they suggest and whether we could hire an investigator from them. Before finally settling on the rates, acting on the advice of the committee, we tabulated the consump tion of every consumer in Bahrain and then tried out the various rates and discussed the results with the committee.lo joi'isL. anil s. : o'-luchc sv.-i e. sni tddi' Bid^ ^alob \6 ^inxaa sx ti t aoi^£oe , iqsD .sldxBaoq ebaa zsw aefa*! sai^iisxl ni nox^oaba'i itluasi sdcf noqa iiasqsb fsifii e.hU iud no isjal an u t doubsi seiwmi sd • iow s'i&amp;qy artt # t dteow teXim IbuJob ati nsiit ladgld aulav b Jb qu sldxsaoq sbfitt asec a^ri iwnLiteu•eaoxi'BO » • t I • C- K. iTi 33.1‘19-ru; 91! f 8B . .I0u. 8r ^Oj'OBx8X^38 8X i.

It will be evident at the end of the year whether these rates are satis factory from the standpoint of income. Muharraq will have to be subsidised by the State. take over the Muharraq extension and will run it. To enable the Muharraq Municipality to do this the govern ment will make a special grant to the municipality. Consumers at Rafaa village are being charged and billed in the usual way. An arrangement, on the lines suggested, is being made regarding the current used by the State Engineer. When he was first employed by the State he was informed that, as in the case of his predecessor, he would have free electric current. There are only two motor vehicles belonging to the electric department, not five. Five motor vehi cles have been used in the last 11 years. At present there is one car and one pick-up. The car was painted this year and supplied with 3 new tyres, which cost Rs 350/-. The Hudson car stands on the books at the same value as the Chevrolet but it is a better car, the change over benefits the electric scheme. The investigation into the cause of the fire at the electric office produced no proof against anyone or suspicion or evidence sufficient to justify a pro secution. I should have welcomed the opportunity of punishing the culprit had there been any evidence whatever to go upon. Yours sincerely, Bahrain.C/528 N&amp;.
