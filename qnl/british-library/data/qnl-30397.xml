Is it usual for the Political Officer at Sharjah to issue Identity Certificates to persons who are not subjects of our Protected Shaikhs? flhile we could justifiably take up the question of the refusal to recognise certificates issued by us to nationals of the Trucial States, we feel we are on more doubtful ground if we try to insist on behalf of the Shaikhs of central Oman who are, theoretically, Muscat nationals. 3.

My dear Sir Pu^ert, Please refer to your letter No. 10111/33 dated the 28th September 1951. 2 . I have told the Sultan about Muhammad bin Salimin and he is grateful for the action taken and information supplied on this and the following matter. 3 . He had just heard about Rashid of Hamasah and has caused letters to be sent to him. He had trouble with this man previouf 1 ^ slave traffic, and thinks that this is an alternative scheme to raise income or for inducing him (Sultan) to pay a subsidy hitherto refused. 4. He does not trust Sulaiman-bin Hamyar and has him under constant secret surveillance even abroad. For example he already knew that he had reached Sharjah on his return journey. He is confident that he cannot do anything in opposition to the Iman who is in close touch with a fact with which I have been increasingly impressed of late. 5. V/hilst I cannot say how effective the Sultan’s immediate actions may be, I do think that he is constantly seeking to increase his tribal influence ( and is actually succeeding). With his meagre resources, this seems to be his only means of securing territorial integrity: but it is a game which can only be played slowly. Anything that we can do to help him gain time, will be much aoprec- iated: and is in fact appreciated. His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K» C. 1 . E. , C. S. X.

CONFIDENTIAL 28th June, 1951* Dear Pelly, y Rashid 'bin Hamad al Shamsi and his brother Mohammed came to see me at ray invitation to-day, and told me about their visit to Saudi Arabia. They found it an unplesant- ly hot, harsh and dusty country which made them ill. They prefer the Sultan of Muscat to Ibn Sa ! ud, who is cruel and ruthless, and they say that the Sultan gives them more money that Ibn Sa’ud gave them. (Current rumours are that their parting present was not Rs.35,000 but Rs.20,000). They explained their failure to call on you in Bahrain by the fact that they were still suffering from the fever brought on by the dust of Arabia. 2. I asked them if we were to consider them Saudis now, and they hastened to repudiate the idea and assured me that they were the slaves of the Dowlah. I asked about their Saudi travel documents, and they said that these were temporary passes only, given them for the sole purpose of journeying to Bahrain. Mohammed did not have one, as he had been supplied with a Certificate of Identity from this Agency on the recommendation of the Medical Officer, Trucial Coast and could go to Bahrain with that. I asked if I might see the Saudi passes, but they had prudently left them in Dubai. I said that as a result of their original request, the matter of their travel documents had been referred to His Excellency and that they could have had passes then if they had waited. They asked if they could have passes in future, and if I would issue passes to their subjects if they sent them to me with letters of recommendation. I said they could have passes in future, but that they would have to surrender their Saudi passes. They said they would do so when they wanted to travel again. I told them that I would issue passes to their subjects for medical reasons on the Doctor*s recommendation, or for the Hajj without reference, but that in all other cases I should have to refer to you or to Kuwait, Qatar etc., and that this was the same rule as was applied to other applicants. 3 . Mohammed bin Hamad asked for a rifle on leaving. I am still trying to get Hadif bin Humaid of Hamriyah , s Saudi pass, and Shaikh Saqr, whose subject he is, has undertaken to produce it. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) A.J. Wilton. C. J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.\ 1 - Political Agent, Muscat. WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCY British Residency, Bahrain, Persian n ' Gu - IB ''' %1.0.1*7 ( 'A 1017/3) Sir 2nl April, 1951 Your excellency’s Despatches o.35 of 25th April, 1950 and Lo. 83 of 23 th ovember, 1350 regarding the future develox&gt;ment of the Trucial states and Central '-lijae an.-*, of our relations with the Rulers and tribal Shaikhs in these two areas. I have also real with interest che jaany additional reports on this subject which have been received from you and your officers during the east year, and am now in a position to give you m views on the oolicy which I consider we should try to pursue. 2. The commitments of uis Majesty’s Government in the Trucial Shaikhdoms arise from the agreei-.ents made with their Rulers as a resiilt of which they ar»e described as British Protected States. I agree that, as inuieated in paragraph 3 of your Despatch ,v]0«o3, ilis ’.ajest:/ s Government ’ s resinous ibility fo ^. 1 b.ie ex uemel aft airs of the Trucial Shaikhdoms and our consequent liability to answer internationally for uhem, coimote an ool-gaoion to take such steps as are open to us, (a) to ensure that their internal affairs are conducted as efiiciently as possible, and to prevent such abuses as could justifiably invite external criticism; ■ and (b) to promote their progressive development in all fields. I recognise therefore that justification for the mainte nance of the special position of Ills Majesty’s Government^ in the Trucial States depends largely on the adoption of o positive policy there. The n ed for tills his become more a j oarent and more urgent now that the development oi oil resources and of civil aviation is liable to bring these States i^to increasing contact with the outsi e world. I consider, moreover, that it is to the advantage of the United Kingdom, which has a considerable material interest in the area, to assist in improving the administrations of these States and in maintaining their indepen,.ince. The first step in this direction has been taken by the estab lishment of the Trucial Oman Levies, and I am glad to learn that this has been welcomed by the Shaikhs as an earn st ox the intentions of his uajes^y's Government. 3. 1 therefore welcome your reco:, ewdation for a Council of the Trucial Shaikhs and I agree that, subject to the considerations in paragraph 4 below, you should proceed with ttiis proposal. Although I appreciate that it may be preferable in the first instance to concentrate on ac de- vinp* joint action by the Shaikhs on a functional” basist* I hope that it may ultimately be possible to bring about closer political co-owaration between them. I realise that anything in the nature of n formal federation may well be a long way ahead, but I wish you to keep this possibility /in His .Excellency Lieutenant Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, .. C. I. E. , etc. , etc. , etc. , Bahrain. C- 3-1. ,0 ) - 2 - in mind and to report in due course, when the results of the initial steps have hoen seen, what you consider to do the likelihood “of achieving it. 4. The timing of the negotiations with the Shaikhs for the formation of a Council is a question which I requires careful consideration. The establishment of the Trucial Oman Levies has caused considerable resentm nt in the minds of King Ibn Saud and his advisers, ana to follow this up immediately with what will presumably be regarded as an attempt to,form an anti-Saudi Confederation may increase the tension. It might well lead to intrigues, iniuiated in Saudi Arabia, to frustrate the project, accompanied possibly by threats or promises which would affect the evi dence given before the frontier fact-finding Commission. On the other hand such evidence of His Majesty s Government o continued interest in and support for uhe Shaikhs against the influence of King Ibn Saud VsTill have a benexioial effect upon their attitude and strengthen them against Saudi Arabian arguments. . I do not doubt that you have these ) 0 int 3 in mind. 5 . I understand the difficulty of including the Shaikh o~ Am Dhabi in a Oouncil with the rest of the Trucial everti lea His 1 tjesty’s Government’s respon sibilities towards this State are the same as those toward the others, and I should prefer if possiole to avoid excla- • * it from the proposals for a Council of Pul era since manV of ttie problems and of the solutions my be common to airthi Trucial States. If, however, the Bnler is unwilling ' Trucial Shaikhs, I hope that it ./ill be possible to advice and assist him independently in Tne i :..p** ovv:&lt; .. n •* o~ hio admi ni s t r a t i on. 6 . I agree that in the initial stages the Political Officer on the Trucial Coast should prepare the agenda and play the leading part in the proposed Council. I hope, however, that ?/hen the Shaikhs become use! to the idea cu joint action and are sufficiently experienced to take the lead in the Council’s deliberations, the Political Officer will be able to hand over his functions to the Shaikhs themselves. Then this stage is reached, considers o.lo * might be given to the employment by the oouncil Oj. a British permanent Secretary who would supervise the pre paration of the Agenda and the execution of the Council s decisions. 7 . My remarks so far have been confined to uhs settled areas *of the Trucial States in which His ..ajesty’s Government have definite obligations and the Trucial bhaixhs exercise control. The problem of our relations with bhe tribes of Central Oman and of our responsibilities in this area is much more difficult, and is fully discussed in your Despatches under reference. Apart from the tribes oj- D ho far a n d in the South fast, which are unuer th no me to control of the Sultan, I have considered the tribes of this area as divide 1 into three grouos:- (i) those under the complete or partial control of the frucial Shaikhs; (ii) those which regard themselves as indep ;ndent or over which the Sultan lias purely nominal control; and those which recognise the authority of the Imae. AI have adopted this division in preference to that made in paragraph 5 of Your )esp&amp;tch ::o# G3 because it has appeared better suited, to t .e views I am about to express. 8 . In so far as the tribes of Group (i) are regarded as Owing allegiance to the Trucial Shaikhs, it may be consi dered that the commitments of His Majesty’s Government in the settled areas of the Trucial Coast extend also to these tribes. I agree therefore that the Trucial Shaikhs should be encouraged to extend their control more directly over the territory of the tribes which can justly be regar ded as owing them allegiance or as under their control. It seems likely that the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Abu Dhabi at least would welcome any suggestion of this kind from His ilajesty’s Government. I should, however, prefer some initial action to be taken by the Shaikhs themselves from their own resources, without the intervention of the Trucial Oman Levies. Although the Levies are intended for use in a normal internal security r 8 le and can be so used at any time in this area, I do not, in view of the considerations I have set out in paragraph 4 above, wish them to become involved in activities which are in the first place essentially a matter for the Shaikhs themselves. 9. kith regard to the tribes of Groups (ii) and (iii), there are two questions which are closely inter-related. The first, v/hich is dealt with in your Despatch Ho. 36, is ‘whether or not it is desirable to establish direct relationships with the paramount Shaikhs of the tribes in these groups. The second, on which you have made certain proposals 1: your Despatch Ho. 83# concerns the adoption Ox a :, forv;ard M policy in 0 ntral Oman. 10. Generally speaking it has been the policy of His Uajesty^ Government in the recent past to regard the territory of the Sultan as extending over the whole of Oman and as far as the limits of the Trucial States. It is clear that this policy involves recognition of the Sultan’s claim to exercise sovereignty over all the tribes in his territory, although in practice the claim may be hollow and his exercise of sovereignty at best purely nominal. I agree with the three reasons you give for not recommending any change in this policy, namely that to do so would: - (a) prejudice our position in the frontier negotiations with Saudi Arabia; (b) be contrary to the interests of Petroleum Concessions Limited, who hold a concession from the Sultan for the whole of his territory (except for Dhofar and Gwadur); and (c) be regarded by the Sultan as a most unfriendly act, and might consequently affect our position in the rest of the Persian Gulf. \ I therefore accept your conclusion that it is not desirable to enter into direct relationships with the Shaikhs of the tribes in Groups (ii) and (iii). .1 would note h re that I am considering separately the questionof the Shaikh of Fujairah, whose request for independent recognition was reported In your Deep, ck o. 39 of Gt , 1950 and on which I hope shortly to give you my views. 11. I turn noW to the proposals made in your Despatch Ho. 83 for more positive action to develop the hinterland of Oman by a gra .ual extension of influence in this area, starting fro:, the Trucial Coast. Such a policy would, as /youyou have pointed out, lead to the following results:- (a) facilitation ooil operations; • (h) safeguarding of communications; and (c) promotion of agricultural development* In addition it v/ould prevent the extension of ling Ibn Saud’s influence. 12 . I have already agreed in paragraph 8 above to the adop tion of this policy in respect of the tribes of Group (i). In the area of the tribes of Groups (ii) and (iii) the most important advantage to His Uajesty’s Government is probably the facilitation of the oil Company^ operations. The other two results v/ould only be of advantage to His Uajesty’s Government in so far as they themselves helped to facilitate these operations, since His Majesty’s Government have no specific obli ation to sponsor the development of this area and no other sufficient material reason for doing so. 13. As against the adoption of a ’’forward' policy there are, in the first place, the arguments you give in paragraph 5 of your Despatch To* 83. These objections a ear to me to be considerable. I am doubtful whether th&lt; Llities in this area in return for which subsidies could be paid, since any air facilities required are available either at Sharjah o_* at unseat and the Oil Company would themselves pay, in the form of royalties and down-payments, for any benefits to be derived from oil exploitation. There would, however, be certain inevitable adminstrative expenses involved in any policy for the extension of influence, for /hieh there would be no direct return. I agree that the danger of accusations of ’’imperialism” may not be very great, but there would probably be criticism from Persia, Ibn Saud and the Sultan. These objections make it difficult for me at present to endorse a policy of which the direct advan tage to His Majesty’s Government is doubtful and which v/ould inevitably involve His Ilajesty’s Government in certain financial and administrative commitments* 14 . I have been interested to learn of the enquiries made by Sulaiman bin Himyar and of Muhammad bin Salimin about the commencem nt of oil operations in their territories, ^-as reported in your letters Hos. 378 / 78 / 30 G of 14 th December and 342/3/30 of 19th December to Mr. Purlonge. The facilitation of oil operations would, as I have stated in paragraph 11 above, be the greatest advantage for His Majesty’s Government of the adoption of a M forward” policy and the enquiries ma&amp;d by these two Shaikhs indicate that they might be prepared to accept such a policy as v/ell as to establish direct relations with His Majesty’s Governme . I agree, however, with the view you have expressed in d_.your letter ko. 1383/2/31 of 12th January to Hr. Purlonge, since to deal separately with these Shaikhs v/ould be inconsistent wit a the policy stated in paragraph 9 above, and with the conclusion I have reached in paragraph 12 . Squally, it would be unwise to encourage the Gil Company to attempt to negotiate direct with the Shaikhs since, apart from offending the Pultan and in the absence of any extension of His Majesty’s Government’s influence in this area, the Company could not be assured of the necessary security or continuity for their operations even if their negotiations were successful. 13- Since th ref ore I am not at present in favour either of establishing separate relations with the Shaikhs of Central Oman or of pursuing a ’’forward” policy beyond the /areasareas of the tribes of Group (i), I consider that you should take every opportunity both to support the Suloaa 1 ullry in his claims to sovereifinty over the whole or the territory of Fuseat and Oman and also to press him to take more vigorouo action to assert his sovereignty. Accounts differ as to ,ne amount of support for the Sultan among the tribes of Group (iii) but it appears not entirely unlikely taat the Sultan may succeed to the authority of the Imam after -he letter s death. The visits of Sulaiman bin Hinyar and of Saleh bin Isa al Hart hi to the Sultan in recent years are possible indications of a willingness to accept his authority, ana if Sulaiman is now genuinely anxious for commercial reasons to invite the Gil Gompany into his territory he may be willing, in return for a share of the Sultan s oil revenues, to allow them to operate under their concession from the Sultan. I appreciate, however, that, while the Imam is a_ive, the Sultan is*likely to find it very difficult to make any real progress among the tribes which are under the former s control. &gt;1 g. does not seem necessarily to apply to the to an el:/ to the tribes of Group (ii). Although both the tribes in the area around Buraimi and in the South-Best along the Saudi Arabian borders are virtually independent, there are renorts of visits by thei-* Shvi^hs oj ohe oultan and of oresents given to them In his ‘dotes on the Tribes sr 19n0) Mr. Chauncy indicateo that a nrufoer o 1 hose tribes (e#g* the Bdru, the Al bu S ha mis and the .a* in) appear to be well-disposed towards ohe gxiltan. though it my well bo ttiat tliose further norta, such as the Bani !*a f ab, will remain impervious to any attempts on the part of the Sultan to extend his authority over the - 17. I shoull be glad therefore if you ./ill, as you suggest in your letter of 12th January to Mr. Uhirlonge, discuss \/it i the Sultan v/hat further steps he considers it possible to tane in order to assert his authority over the tribes in Group (ii), and to increase his prospects of recognition by the tribes at present under the control of the Imam on tie latter 1 s death. You will no doubt discuss with him at the same time means by which the Oil Company can be enabled to operate in the interior of Oman, with particular reference to the requests from Sulaiman bin Hirnyar and Huhaim ad bin Sal irin. 18. Finally, and in the light of the policies outlined above, I have considered your proposal that a separate Political Agency should be established on the Trucial Coast, directly subordinate to the political Resident and in the charge of a .7 officer. I agree in orincipl ith tois since I consider it to be in accordance win t : : -increased roc jonsibiliti.es of the post arising from the development of oil operations, the arrival of the Crucial Oman Levies and the intention to establish a Council of Shaikhs. The possibilities of implementing this proposal will be discussed with you separately. I regret, however, that the intent! to build a new 1 geney building at Dubai has ha i to oe post poned temporarily, for the reasons explained in Colonel Codrin ton’s letter Ho. :C01/91 '1/1951A of 17th March. To sum arise the decisions indicated in this Despatch; (i) I agree in principle to the establishment of a Council of the Trucial Shaikhs, including, if /possible 19*r . V - 6 - Dossible, the Shsi^-h of A*bu initially uiidwr the chairmanship of the Political Officer on the Trucial Coast. (ii) I agres tliat the Timcial Shaikhs should oura S® &lt; ^ to extend their control over the tex’ritory of tribes v/hicr may legitimately be regarded as o\ 7 ing them allegiance. (iii) I do not at present wish to enter into separate negotiations v/ith the Shaikhs of Central Oman, and I should not v/ish to encourage the Oil Company to adopt this policy. (iv) I do not in oresent circumstances favour the adop- tion~of a 'forward' policy in any territory over which the rultan claims sovereignty. (v) I consider that the Sultan should be supportedin his territorial claims and pressed to take action to assert them, and I hope tliat you will be able to discuss with him the means to achieve this and also to enable the Oil Company to operate in the area of their coness- sio .i. (vi) I agree in principle that an independent x'olitical Agency should be established on the Trueial Coast, reporting direct to the Reside i.cy. 20.

I a - inclined to share this view myself as I aiu very doubtful if the company really wish to operate so f r from their present base,^ I x-.i/nc they would experience great .rouble with the tribes il attested to do so, and if they were to estaolisn themselves they would have great difficulty in maintaining their comnaini- cations owing to the fact that the whole of the eoasu is under the control of eitiier the Sultan or ourselves* 3.

It includes accounts of meetings between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant Colonel Sir William Rupert Hay) and the Sultan, discussing the Sultan's efforts to increase his influence among the shaikhs of the Omani tribes.Much of the correspondence discusses future British policy regarding the Trucial states and central Oman. Of particular note is a letter from Geoffrey Warren Furlonge of the Foreign Office's Eastern Department to the Political Resident (ff 30-35), discussing several policy issues, including the following: whether the Trucial shaikhs should be encouraged to extend their authority over those tribes that may be considered as owing them allegiance; whether the British should enter into direct relations with the shaikhs of central Oman; proposals from the Political Resident for the creation of a Council of Trucial Shaikhs and the establishment of a separate Political Agency on the Trucial Coast.Other related matters covered in the correspondence include the following: reports of Omani shaikhs asserting their allegiance to neighbouring states, such as Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia; the issuing of identity certificates by the Political Officer at Sharjah to Omani tribe members, following earlier accounts of tribe members travelling to Saudi Arabia without certificates and being issued with Saudi travel documents.The file also includes Arabic and English copies of letters received by the Sultan from various Omani shaikhs. Other notable correspondents include the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Agency, Bahrain; the Political Officer, Sharjah.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Eastern Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Travel documents</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
