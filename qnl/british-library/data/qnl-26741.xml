Dear Baggallay, I have made enquiries from the Italian section regarding the attached list of artillery material. The list contains component parts of 2 batteries of 75 ra.m. field guns 27 pattern, 4 batteries of 75 m.m. field guns 13 pattern, and two batteries of 65 m.m. mountain guns of 17 pattern. Each battery contains 4 guns. The Italian section consider that it would be of no value translating the list in detail, as the parts enumerated form the components of 8 batteries. I hope this will meet your requirements. Yours sincerely, (Signed) G.R. RUSSELL.i Tbs War Office, Lonclon, S.W.l. 26th May,1931. Dear Colonel, I received, the attached from the Foreign Office. It was sent to them from the Embassy in Rome as the Afghan Minister there had applied to our Minister for permission to send this material via India. I cannot translate this in detail, but from the headings I understand it refers to 8 batteries of Tb’s in all. The batteries seem to be of an out of date type, and the deal does not appear to indicate any great activity on the part of Italian munition firms. If possible, could you let us and the Foreign Office have a brief description of what the material consists of? As the Foreign Office want the attached list returned to them would you mind sending it direct as we have no further use for it. Yours sincerely, (Signed) G.
