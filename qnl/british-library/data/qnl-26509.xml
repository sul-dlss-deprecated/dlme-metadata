Sir, You will have seen from the enclosures to my despatch No. 537 of the 7th March that the French Ambassador, in a recent conversation with Sir Robert Vansittart, expressed some apprehension with regard to Italian designs on Sheikh Said in the Yemen, and i that His Majesty’s Government have received other reports suggesting exceptional Italian activity in the Red Sea. 2, I request that you will inform the French Government that, as a result of these reports, His Majesty’s Government have instituted urgent enquiries and hope soon to receive information as to their accuracy. In the meantime, however, His Majesty’s Government are inclined to treat with reserve these reports of Italian activity, at any rate in their more sensational forms. It seems unlikely that the Italian Government would openly disregard the letter or the spirit of the Anglo-Italian Agreement unless they were prepared to precipitate a general conflict. R.I.

Mr. Butler: I know of no grounds for representations to the Italian Govern ment. Article 4 ( 2 ) ( 6 ) of Annex 3 to the Anglo-Italian Agreement provides for the presence of Italian officials on certain islands in the Red Sea, including Jebel Zukur. Sir P. Harris: Is care taken to ensure that the entry of officers is not utilised for military purposes?Mr. Butler: I have no information that there are any fortifications, and the actual terms of the agreement were that officers might be present to protect fishermen who resort to the island. I have no exact information as to whether these are soldiers or not. Mr. Noel-Baker: Will the Government consider sending agents from Aden to inquire whether fortifications are being erected or a base established? Mr. Butler: I have said that we have no information that that is the case. Mr. Noel-Baker: I am asking the Government to send agents to find out.

(4) A record of a conversation between the Counsellor of M.?

In addition, I am to invite attention to an article in the 'Daily Herald' of the 17th February about an alleged Italian bargain with the Yemen over certain islands off the Yemeni coast and to questions asked in Parliament on the 20th February by Mr. G.

It seems likely that all these reports have some common basis either of truth or misunderstanding. 7/hat this basis may be is a question which clearly requires early investigation and the following observations are offered as a background to this invebtigationo 5. A French claim to Sheikh Said on the ground of what happened in 1868 is not tenable and it is almost inconceivable that any French Government should put it forward at this date. Apart, however, from any historical claim, the French Government might possibly think it desirable to occupy Sheikh Said themselves sooner than let the Italian Government do so. Unless it were certain beyond all doubt that the Italian Government had the firm intention to take this step, a French occupation would be an act of supreme folly; and even if the Italian intention were clear, the situation would be one in which the French Government ought not to act except after full consultation with His Majesty's Government. Government.Q, Governmento 6 . The Italian Government have continued since the signature of the Middle Eastern Agreement on the 16th April, 1938, to show the same interest in the maintenance of its validity and effectiveness as they used formerly to show in the Rome Understanding of 1927. Their latest communication about the French claim to Sheikh Said is in accordance with this attitude, the motives for which have often been discussed in the past. As a result of these discussions it has generally been agreed that the Italian Government will continue to observe such undertakings for so long as, but for no longer than, they think that to do so will serve their interests better than to face an open struggle for power in Arabia, This may well be the case. It is also undoubtedly the case that the Italian Government continue to court the favour of Yemeni officials, and to intrigue in the Yemen generally. But even so there is no very obvious reason why Italy should wish to embark on an open struggle for power at this time, unless she is willing to extend the area of the contest to the Mediterranean and even to the whole world. 7, As regards the recent Parliamentary Questions, the Italian Government have made no secret of having supplied arms to the Yemen. But in any case the sale, or even the loan or gift, of arms to the Yemeni Government by the Italian Government is not in itself a breach of the Middle Eastern Agreement, provided that Italy does not seek in return to acquire sovereignty or a privileged position of a political character in Yemeni territory (including Yemeni islands ) 080 Similarly some increase or variation in the size, number or composition of the posts on the Hanish islands or Jehel Zukur is not a hreach of the Agreement, provided Italy does not seek do establish sovereignty over or fortifications in those islands» 9. In all the circumstances it is difficult to believe that the Italian Government would really place forty- three or any other number of guns on Sheikh Said - even on the excuse that it was necessary to forestall the French Government - or fortify Jebel Zukur or indulge in any other obvious breach of the letter or spirit of the Middle Eastern Agreement, except as a deliberate prelude to the engineering of a fresh crisis, IQ, For these reasons Lord Halifax is inclined to treat the more sensational reports of Italian activities with some reserve, especially as such activities could not, he presumes continue for long without coming to the knowledge of the authorities at Aden or His Majesty's Ships. At the same time these reports, if they are true, are of too serious a nature to be disregarded. In consequence it seems essential that His Majesty’s Government should be placed as soon as possible in possession of the latest local information; and I am to ask that the local naval authorities may be instructed urgently to report by telegram, if possible, after special investigation, whether they have any information which confirms them, 11o Until local information is available, it does not appear to Lord Hal ifax that a meeting between representatives of the departments cnr^e.nec would serve any useful purpose. When this information has been obtained His Lordship will detaildetail a representative of his department to take part in a meeting if this is desired by the other departments concerned. It must be remembered, however, that the whole question of i nter alia the action to be taken in the event of a foreign threat to the Yemen was exhaustively considered by the Chiefe of Staff in February 1957 (C 0 OoS c 563 of the 19th February, 193?)(and :-ter by the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee on the 8th June, 1937; 51st Meeting) and except in the face of an actual crisis it does not seem likely that more definite conclusions could be reached now than were reached by the Chiefe of Staff then. 12 0 A similar letter is being sent to the Colonial Office with reference to enquiries of the Governor of Aden and copies are being sent to the jther departments represented on the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee.

Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) C. W.@ I 1/ BRITISH EMBASSY, PARIS. 3rd January, 1939. My Lord, I have the honour to inform you that M. Charles Maurras, in the 'Action Franjaise', has, since the middle of December, repeatedly called for the occupation by French forces of the Peninsula of Sheikh-Sa¥d on the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. His articles have given rise to a number of letters in which various considerations are advanced in favour of the thesis that Sheikh- Sa2d is French territory. 2. M. Maurras points out that the Peninsula of Sheikh-Sa2d dominates the Straits and with Doumerrah, without counting Perim, is a point of double and even treble utility. He states that on the day after the Anglo-Italian Agreements one of his collabor ators wrote to the French Ministry of Colonies for information about Sheikh-Said and received the reply that this territory had never been ta,.en possession of by the French Government and that a certain number of communications concerning Sheiidi-Sald, which had been addressed to the Department of the Colonies, had been transmitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose concern it was to examine questions of this nature. 3. The publication of this letter produced a detailed letter from a correspondent in which the French claim to Cheixh- Ca?d is given at some length. The writer states that on the 1st October 1868 a company composed of MM. Max Bazin, Van den Brock and Alfred Roubaud of Marseilles acquired the territory of heikh—Sa2 d from Ali iabatt, theikh of Akhemi —ed— Douein the The Right Honourable Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.C.I., G.C.I.E., etc. , etc. , etc. Copy (E 110/110/91) No. 9 (58/1/39) priceI price of 80,000 Maria-Teresa dollars (about 400,000 gold francs). This territory was delimited by a semi-circle traced at z-s 42 kilometres from the extreme point of the Peninsula; its area was about 1,650 square kilometres. To prove his proprietary and sovereign right over bheikh-Sa2d, Ali Tabatt had it certified by seven Sheikhs belonging to neighbouring tribes. When the Marseilles Company wished to have their Act of Acquisition registered at the French Consulate at Aden, the Consul, M. de Crety, would not effect the registration without being certain of the powers of Sheikh Ali Tabatt. He consequently instituted an enquiry which established that this Sheikh had always been independent and that he had acted within his full powers. The Act of Acquisition was accordingly registered at the Aden Consulate on the 14th October, 1868. It is certain that M» de Crety sent an authentic copy of this document and a reoort to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These documents must be in the archives of the Quai d’Orsay, The territory was definitely taken possession of by the Marseilles Company at the beginning of 1869: personnel directed by M. Tian disembarked and constructed buildings and a small fort which is, moreover, mentioned as French in English and German maps. In June 1869 the KaJmakam of Moka took the initiative of sending troops there: the French Consul at Aden protested to the Governor of the Yemen, who had them withdrawn. At the beginning of 1370 a further attempt at occupation was made by the Turks. The French Consul at Aden warned the Governor, who sent a frigate, the I, Bruat ,, . The Turks withdrew and the navy installed, a coaling depot. in order to prevent Turkish incursions being renewed and in order to establish definitelydefinitely French rights to Lheikh-Laid, the Ministry sent instructions to the French Ambassador at Constantinople, M. Bouree, who signed at the Cublime Porte on the 7th July 1870 a treaty recognising France’s Protectorate over Sheikh-Laid. This treaty must also be found in the archives of the Quai d’Orsay. French rights thus derive from two treaties: that of the 1st October 1368 with SheiKh Ali Tabatt, and that of the 7th July 1870 with the Sublime Porte. Before going further, says the writer, is it too much to ask the Government to publish these two treaties? Every Frenchman has the right to .mow them. 3. Subsequent articles mention the following additional points (i) M. Albert Larraut, in his ”Mise en Valeur des Colonies Fran?aises :l , included a map in which Lheikh-Lald is called French. (ii) 'Larousse Universel” in two volumes, Paris 1922, describes Sheikh-Laid as French territory in Asia on the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. (iii) The 'Annuaire General’, 1928 edition, 'which is for France what the ’Gotha’ is for Germany', gives on page 806 the following notice :- 'Sheikh-Said, Asiatic territory on the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb on the south-western extremity of the Arabian Peninsula. The Treaty signed at Constantinople on the 7th July 1870 recognises rights of France over this territory and guarantees thethe legitimacy of the acquisition which was made from Sheikh Ali Tabatt-Dourein by the Company Rabaud-Bazin of Marseilles and transferred to the French Government in 1886. Approximate extent : 1622 square kilometres: Population - 1 million.' (iv) 'An Atlas of Current Affairs' by J. H. Horrabin, published by Victor Gollancz, Limited, 14, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, says on page 29: 'The French hold a part of Somaliland with the port of Jibuti: and that have a footing on the Arabian side of the Strait at Sheikh-Said.' (v) The 'Bottin' of 1930 puts the abbreviation '*Fr. ' after Sheikh-Said on the Somali map, to show its nationality; and (vi) Phillip’s Imperial Atlas of the World, London 1894, marks the Somali territory of Sheikh-Sa2d, like that of Obock, in violet ink in order to distinguish it from the British possessions alongside, which are given in pink. 4. All the facts quoted above go to show, according to M. Maurras, that the French Government should not delay for one moment in sending a cruiser, a company of infantry and a battery of artillery to Sheikh-Said in order to establish effective occupation and anticipate Italo-German pretensions. He says that the barracks built by the Turks are still there. I have the honour to be, etc. (Sgd.)

Turkish Minister had known for some time that these guns had been sent out to Italian East Africa and he understood intention had been to mount them on Dumeira Island but they were t^ be mounted instead on Sheik Seid. 2.

Addressed to Foreign Office No. 48 Saving, repeated to AdenCopy (E 1480/110/91) No. 174 (10/141/39) British Embassy, Rome. 24th February, 1939. My Lord, I have the honour to report that the 'Messaggero' of February 22nd published a leading article in reply to those French newspapers which urged the Paris Government to proceed without delay to the occupation of Sheikh Said. The article maintained that a Sheikh Said question did not exist and that one could not conceive a more arbitary or absurd claim than that of a French occupation of Sheikh Said. 2. The article recalled that the territory in question was purchased in 1868 by the Marseilles shipping firm Rabaud-Bazin from Ali Tabat, the chief of a local tribe, for 80,000 talers^ it was first used as a coaling-depbt, but was afterwards abandoned. Mere than 70 years had passed, and during this long period of time the French Government had never thought of exercising their authority even formally, over the territory. There had been occasions on which France might have put forward her rights or made a protest; for instance, in 1902, when Turkey reinforced her garrison at Bab-el-Mandeb; in 1905, 1911 and 1914 when England and the Ottoman Empire proceeded to the delimitation of the Aden boundaries; and after the war, when Yemen sovereignty was substituted for that of /Turkey The Right Hon. Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., StC » y 6'fcc«j 6'fcc«j Foreign Office.2\ f Turkey in South western Arabia. Nor did Prance break her silence after the signing of the Lausanne Treaty. Of decisive importance was the Treaty of Friendship concluded between prance and Yemen in 1935* by v/hich Prance recognised ’•without restriction or condition” the Yemen as a free, sovereign and independent country. Article 2 laid down that perpetual peace and friendship would reign between the French Government and the King of the Yemen with no exception as to persons or places* These terms were clear and precise and they implied the recognition by France of Yemen sovereignty on Sheikh Said. The Treaty of Friendship eliminated such doubts as might have existed. The logical conclusion was that no one could call in question the right of the Imam of the Yemen to regard Sheikh Said as forming an integral part, from every stand point, of the Yemen. 4. As regards Great Britain, her position was equally clear. Apart from the Anglo-Turkish Agreement relating to the boundaries of Aden, there were the Anglo- Italian Agreement of April 16, 1938. Under these Agreements the two Powers declared that it was in their common interest that no other Power should acquire or seek to acquire sovereignty or any privileged position of a political character in any territory which at present belonged to Saudi Arabia or to the Yemen. This clear affirmation reflected the spirit of Italian policy towards the Yemen and Saudi Arabia - ”a policy of absolute loyalty ”and frank friendship, a constant and immutable policy ’•based on the full respect of independence and territorial /integrity'integrity'. This policy was consecrated in the treaties of friendship which Italy had concluded with the two Arab States and in the Anglo-Italian Agreement relating to the Red Sea. In these documents the respect for the independence and integrity of the Yemen and Saudi Arabia was regarded as a fundamental element of equilibrium and as an essential condition of the maintenance of peace. 5* The deduction to be drawn was simple, logical and obvious. Italy could tolerate no violation of the territorial integrity or of the political independence of the two Arab States. In plainer words, Italy would never allow Rrance to lay her hands on Sheikh Said and would likewise oppose any other attempt on the territory of the Yemen or of Saudi Arabia. 6. Reference to the French claims on Sheikh Said was also made by the 'Stampa' (February 23rd), which said that Italy would oppose even by force any French enterprise of this kind.

The Italian Government had made enquiries of the Italian Embassy in Paris, who had replied that these articles had indeed been appearing, and that it was rumoured in the corridors of the Chmaber of Deputies that the French Government had approached H.MoG. on the subject but had as yet received no reply to this approach, 3. Signor Crolla added that the view which the Italian Government would take of any attempt by the French Government to occupy Shaikh Said would be governed by the declarations to which they had given their signature in the Middle Eastern Agreement, Shaikh Said being, in the opinion of the Italian Government, an integral part of the territory of the Yemen. 4. In the circumstances, the Italian Government wished to bring these considerations to the notice of H.M.G., and had instructed Signor crolla to say that they would be interested to receive any indication of the views of H.M.G. which H.M.G. for their part might be able to give them. /5.1491 IQ 5, I told Signor Crolla that H«M 0 G-c had also had their attention drawn to articles about Shaikh Said in the French Press, but that to the best of ray recollection no approach had ever been made to H.M.G-o on this subject by the French Government» In the circumstances, I could not tell him anything about what might be the intentions or desires of the French Government, But in any case I felt sure that H»M«G, intended to abide scrupulously by the Middle Eastern Agreement, (Signed) L.

He admits that certain Italian firms have supplied arms to the Government of the Yemen, but points out that those supplies, form part of the normal and traditional trade between Italy and the Yemen, and that the transaction has been made against cash. Great Britain herself had in the last few months furnished a considerable amount of arms to other Arab States in the Red Sea. No clause in the Anglo- Italian Agreement forbade Italy to make such consignments of arms; it was only the ’’tendentious phantasy” of the ’’Daily Herald” that could affirm the contrary. Nor had Italy tried by these supplies to obtain political privileged positions in the Yemen. It was false that Italy had shrouded with secrecy her clear activities with the Yemen, It was even more false that she had obtained the virtual control of numerous islets along the western shore of the Red Sea, where she was proposing to set un small naval bases. It was equally false that oil resources were to be found in those islands. Of the ’’Daily Herald” article there remained, therefore, its well-known tendency to cast, by these inventions, suspicion on Italian policy which in the Red 3ea was clear in its aims and means, ’’completely faithful to the undertakings embodied in the Anglo-Italian Agree ments, founded only upon respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of the Arab States of the Eastern shore of the Red Sea and upon the vail to see that the same respect is ^iown by all the other Powers”.1 further communicatjaft oi^this subjecK please qu^bte and address —not to any person by name, Mut to— / “ The Under-Secretary of State,’ Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. w- Vl; THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign T -r-y - compliments to and, by direction of the Sdbrt P.Z. 7650 \ t .

Sanna (Yemen), August 25. - A sensational news comes from South Arabia that a new secret agreement has been concluded between the Imam of Yemen and the Italian Government. Kazi Raghib, the foreign Minister and Dr. W.Ceehi, the Italian representatives signed the document on behalf of their respective Governments. Dr. Ceehi has for some months past been in charge of the Italian hospital in Sanna, the Capital of Yemen. After concluding the secret pact, the Italian doctor left by a special ’plane for Asmara where he conferred with the Italian authorities and explained them the implications of the new agreement. From there he flew in the same ’plane immediately to Rome to place the document before the Duce. The conclusion of this pact so suddenly seems to suggest that there is more than that meets the eye. This is especially evident from the fact that only a npnth before the coronation of King George VI Capt. Seagull Asstt. Adviser to the Government of Aden and an expert on Yemenite and South Arabian affairs had seen the Imam of Yemen and placed before him the concrete proposals of the British Government to arrive at an agreement between the British and Yemen Governments in case of war breaking out. He had full discussions with the Imam and TREATY WITH YEMEN SUCCESS OF ITALIAN DIPLOMACY (From our own correspondent.) the /5?) 2 the Imam had told him that he would inform the British authorities of his decision in the matter of further negotiations when his son, Saif an Ismail Hussein, who had proceeded to London as his representative at the Coronation would return after the celebrations and after he had concluded his scheduled tour over the continent and Egypt. Upto now there has been no further talks on the question. It is stated that H.E. Colonel Reiley, the G-overnor / of Aden went in an R.A.F. r plane to Hadramonth and inspected there the new fortifications carried on by the British authorities round about the area including the two states of G-aity and Kasseeri and the nine coastal places in the neighbourhood. \f INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, pieas^ quote N °- frjs/ /zi /^ and address— not to any person by pam^ihnt {of— ' “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. ■ f irr 6192 t a' / THE Under-Secretary of State ^for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to ,^T tXX and, by directed of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop/' of the under-mentioned paper.

WITH reference to Mr. Calvert’s Confidential despatch No. 239 of the 5th September last, I have the honour to report that the Italian LegationTias recently distributed locally further copies of the Barid-al-Barqa, the newspaper in Arabic published at Benghazi. Copies dated the 16th and 24th August and the 8th September have come to my notice. 2. Much of the news contained in these three issues is not worth reporting in detail. In that of the 6th September, however, is a leading article entitled : “ Pacific Policy of Italy : Renewal of Friendship between Italy and the Yemen,” in which a reference is made to the extension of the treaty of 1926, between the two countries, for a further period of one year (until November 1937). This is claimed as proof of the friendly disposition of the Fascist State towards Arab countries generally, with whom Italy desires to promote economic relations based on respect for their institutions and for their inviolability. The article alludes to the circulation in the press in some Arab countries of reports that Italy intended to attack the Yemen, and declares it superfluous to publish further denials of such reports (which it attributes to unspecified foreign sources), in view of the Duce’s pronouncement that Italy will now confine her activities to the peaceful development of Ethiopia. 3.

CONFIDENTIAL. v fE 5515/2617/91] Section 2. Copy No. Mr. Ingram to Mr. Eden.—(Received September 1.) (No. 950.) Sir, ^ Rome, August I HAVE the honour to inform you that, according to a recent Stefani communique, the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between Italy and the Yemen dated the 2nd September, 1926, the text of which was enclosed in Mr. (now Sir Charles) Wingfield’s despatch from this Embassy, No. 846 of the 4th October, 1926, has been extended until November 1937 by an exchange of notes between the two Governments. I shall not fail to supply you with the text of these notes as soon as they are published in the Official Gazette. 2. The extension of this treaty has been the occasion of considerable comment in the press here. An article in the Popolo di Roma recalls that the important points established by the treaty were the declaration by the Government of the Yemen of their willingness to import technical material from Italy and to admit Italian experts into the country to assist in its economic development, and the declaration by the Italian Government of their willingness to grant facilities in this sense. When the treaty was concluded (continues the writer of the article) a number of Arab journals expressed the fear that Italy was planning to turn the Yemen into a zone of exclusive Italian influence and that the provisions of the treaty were not compatible with the full independence of that country. The ten years which have lapsed since the treaty was signed have been sufficient to explode this myth. Not only does the agreement not impinge in any way on the liberty of action of the Yemen Government, who are not obliged by it to accept Italian materials or experts against their wishes and whose liberty to purchase in whatever market they wish is expressly reserved, but Italy’s policy since the signature has given rise to no suspicions that she has any other designs in the country than those compatible with true friendship. 3. In an article in the Messaggero it is stated that the prolongation of the treaty corresponds with the plans of the Italian Government for the development and maintenance of peaceful relations with the countries on the eastern coast of the Red Sea, where there exists a long tradition of commercial exchange and affinity of custom and religion with Ethiopia. Italy is determined, says the writer of this article, through relations of ‘ £ bon-voisinage ” maintained with these States, to contribute by all the means in her power to their progress and civilisation. She has no designs on their independence or their autonomy. This policy ‘ c is an aspect of the Italian Empire which will assume more and more importance as time goes on and which fits in perfectly with the programme of relations between Italy and the Orient on which the Duce insisted in two memorable speeches.' The speeches to which reference is here made appear to be those which he pronounced at the opening of the Congress of Asiatic Students in December 1933, a summary of which was enclosed in Sir Eric Drummond's despatch N o 990 of the 22nd December of that year, and his discourse before the second Quinquennial Fascist Assembly (a translation of this speech was enclosed by his Excellency in his despatch N o 245. of the 19th March, 1934). I venture to draw your particular attention to the portions of this speech in which Signor Mussolini touches on the role that Italy was designed by history and geography to play in Asia and Africa. Recent events give his words a peculiar significance. 4. Thus it Will be seen that the renewal of the treaty between Italy and the Yemen has been made the occasion for ^ number of inspired articles illustrating the role of patron and friend which Italy aspires to play and which she believes she has already begun to play in the Near East. Collaboration with the Arab races, as the Giornale d'Italia observes, is to be developed to the mutual advantage of both parties. The conquest of Ethiopia, it is said, has been a great [806 a—2]step in this direction, for opposite the Arab littoral now lies, not the amorphous dynasty of Abyssinia, but the Italian Empire with its harbours and roadsteads open to the exchange both of goods and of ideas. Nevertheless Italy does not, it is maintained, cherish designs on the liberty of the Arab States. On the contrary, their independence and their friendship are cardinal points in her policy. 5. These comments are doubtless designed to impress foreign (and in particular Arabian) as much as Italian opinion with the value of friendship with the newly-founded Italian Empire and with the innocuousness of Italian policy so far as the eastern shores of the Red Sea are concerned. Time alone can show the extent to which these professions will be translated into practice. 6 . I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s representative at Jedda. I have, &amp;c. E. M. B.

My dear George, Your letter of the 7th Septemher (3 5523/2617/91) on the subject of Italian designs on the Yemen. You have no doubt by now seen our despatch No.950 (203/1/36) of the 2Sth August on this subject. There is really not a great deal which we can add to the information contained in that despatch. At various times since the \ conclusion of the Italo-Yemenite Treaty in 1926 there have been rumours that Italy was casting an acquisitive eye on the Yemen, but at the same time and up till last year, the Italian authorities showed a desire to allay these suspi ions as far as possible. Y/e ought not, however, to forget the speech which Signor Mussolini made to the Quinquennial Fascist Assembly in 1934. In this 8x&gt;eech, to which we drew your special attention in our despatch N o.950 and which formed the subject of the Embassy’s despatch No.245 (189/2/34) of the 19th March, 193 , he said that ’’Italy’s historical ’’objectives have two names: Asia and Africa. South and 'east are the cardinal points which should stimulate the 'interest and determination of Italians. Northwards there 'is little or nothing to be donej nor is there more to ”be done westwards, neither in Europe nor beyond the ocean. ’’These objectives of ours hove their justification in ’’geography and in history. Of all the great western 'Powers of Europe the nearest to Africa and to Asia is 'Italy. A few hours by sea, fewer still by air, suffice 'to G. Y . endel, Esq. ,GM.G. • • •'to join Italy to frica and Asia. Let no one misunder- 'stand the scoxje of this secular task which assign to 'this and future Italian gener tions. It is not a matter 'of territorial conquests, and let t'iis he understood hy 'all ne.- r and far alike, hut of a natural expansion which 'should lead to collaboration between Italy and the peoples 'of Africa, between Italy and the nations of the Near and 'Middle East.' As an assurance of peaceful intentions dignor Musoolinlb declaration has of course proved valueless in the event, but it is perhaps of some interest as an open indication, if one were needed, of Italian aspirations in the Near and Miudle East. There can be no real doubt that Italy desires to increase her influence in that part of the world and there is every reason to suppose that she would be glad enough to establish a footing on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea if a favourable opportunity offered. All this, however, does not mean that Signor Mussolini has already prepared plane for an early advance against the Yemen. On the contrary we believe that while there are no doubt not a few Italians - and some of them perhaps in high places - who are casting covetous glances at the Arabian shores of the Red Sea, no serious authority con templates any forward action in th- t area for the moment. Italy has trouble enough on her hands, particularly in the economic and financial spheres, and of course Abyssinia has still to be digested; indeed, the greeter part of that country has not yet even been swallowed. Italy’s foreign policy is essentially opportunist and I therefore hesitate to venture any prophecy as to future trends. My own personal view is that Italy will quietlybut determinedly raake a drive during the next few years at undermining our influence in the Arab and Moslem so we must be prepared for intrigue of every sort. I doubt whether they will 'strike 11 just yet. They more likely to concentrate on preparing the ground, in the hope that they may eventually be able to get they want without having to 'strike' at all. Yours ever, world; But are perhaps v.hat (Signed) E. M. B. INCKtAS-!.(%i) P.Z.428 6/36. Secret. Extracts from Politics.! Intelligence Summary (Aden) No.487 for the week ending 27th May 1936. 5853.

The King of the YEMEN is said to he very anxious about the delay on the part of the Italian (Government in sending a Mission to San’a to conduct negotiations for the renewal of the existing treaty between the two Governments, which will expire in December 1936. He suspects that the Italians have purposely delayed the despatch of a Mission until they have completely occupied Ethiopia; they might then send a Mission with instructions that they are not willing to renew the treaty but that they are prepared to conclude a fresh one with better terms for themselves with a view to acquiring certain rights and concessions in the YEMEN.Ort'o* *-f */— Notes. * i , ^ Rdgfster No. ^731 SECRET.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No.796, Confidential, of the 21st ultimo, I have the honour to enclose herewith a translation of the Italian text of the treaty signed on the 2nd ultimo by the Imam of Yemen and the Governor of Eritrea. 2. As this treaty was only handed to me at a late hour this afternoon, the translation is a hurried one, and a copy of the Italian text will not be ready in time to catch this evening’s bag. It must therefore follow by the next. 3. To-day’s midday papers announced the arrival in Rome of the Governor of Eritrea u in order to report to the Prime Minister on the policy pursued by him in the Yemen, which has happily resulted in the conclusion of a commercial treaty”, and his Excellency doubtless brought the treaty in question to Rome with him. I have, etc., CHARLES WINGFIELD. (Translation). Enclosure in No.l. Treaty between Italy and the Yemen . His Majesty Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy, and His Majesty the Imam Jahia, Emir-el-Mumenin, King of the Yemen, desirous of making more close and lasting the friendship between their two kingdoms and wishing to facilitate/2 facilitate and develop the economic relations hetween their two countries; His Majesty the King of Italy hy the instrumentality of his representative, his Excellency the Cavaliere Jacopo Gasparini, Governor of Eritrea; and His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam Jahia, Emir-el-Mumenin, have together agreed upon what follows:- ARTICLE 1 . The Government of His Majesty the King of Italy recognise the full and absolute independence of the Yemen and of its sovereign, His Majesty the Imam Jahia* The Italian Government will not interfere in the Kingdom of His Majesty the King of Yemen in any manner which is incompatible with what has been said in the first paragraph of the present article. ARTICLE 2 . The two Governments undertake to facilitate commercial exchanges between their respective countries. AR TICLE 3 . The Government of His Majesty the King of Yemen declare that it is their desire to import from Italy the supplies ('forniture”), i.e. the means and the technical material which can advantageously be employed for the economic development of the Yemen, as also the technical personnel. And the Italian Government declare that they intend to do all that is possible in order to provide the means and the technical material and personnel in the manner most convenient as regards to quality, price and salaries. ARTICLE 4 . What has been said in articles 2 and 3 does not limit the liberty of the two parties with regard to commerce and supplies ( 'forniture'). Article 5/—L 1 y 3. ARTICLE 5 . No merchant of the two States will be allowed to import or to carry on trade in articles prohibited by the two Governments in their respective countries. Both the two Governments will have the right of confiscating articles, imported into their respective countries in spite of a prohibition of import, or of trade in that articles, after such prohibition has been published. ARTICLE 6 . The present treaty will not enter into force until the ratification of His Majesty the King of Italy has reached His Majesty the King of Yemen, the Imam Jahia. ARTICLE 7 .

ARTICLE 8. In faith of the above His Majesty the King of Yemen, the Imam Jahia, and his Excellency the Cavaliere Jacopo Casparini, in the name of His Majesty the King of Italy, have signed the present treaty drawn up in two exactly identical copies, in the Arabic and in the Italian languages. As, however, there is nobody at the Court of His Majesty the King of Yemen who knows perfectly the meaning of the Italian language; as the conferences for the present treaty of friendship and commerce were carried on by both parties in Arabic, and as his Excellency the Cavaliere Jacopo Gasparini has assured himself that the Arabic text is/is exactly equivalent to the Italian; the two parties agree to he hound, in case of doubt or of divergent interpretations of the two texts, hy the Arabic text interpreted according to the classical language.
