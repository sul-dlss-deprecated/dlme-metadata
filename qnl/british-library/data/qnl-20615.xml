Dear Clauson, In reply to your letter of the 6th July(P.Z.4606/36), we agree that in the event of Petroleum Concessions Limited securing concessions in Bahrein, or on the Prucial Coast, the Company should subscribe to political agreements on the lines (*4 of the Qatar Agreement amended as suggested in your express L 2** letter of the 3rd April (P.Z.2078/36), with the further t £ I amendment mentioned below and (in the Trucial Agreements) with the addition of an article regarding the boundaries inter se of the Sheikhdoms, on the lines suggested in the enclosure to your express letter of the 20th May. —''A r ;/ The Qatar Agreement included the usual provisions relating inter alia, to the registration in Great Britain of any transferee or subsidiary company, but had no similar provisions in respect of the parent company itself. This was not necessary when we were dealing with a company like the Anglo-Persian, but it would seem desirable to deal with it in the case of Petroleum Concessions Limited, otherwise one cf the main objects of the political agreement might be defeated. I would, therefore, suggest inserting the words 'Petroleum Concessions Limited and' at the beginning of paragraph 2 (as already amended) of the Qatar Agreement before the words 'any subsidiary Company shall be and remain a British Company registered in Great Britain, etc.'. If this were done, I i-hink it would be better to reverse the order of paragraphs 1 Q-nd ui y and so refer first of all to the parent company ^nc. any subsio.iary company, and then deal with any transferee company.

Dear Mr#Weiton, I attach copy of a letter received by Major Holmes, our Negotiator now on the Trueial Const, from the officiating Political Agent,Bahrain, dated July 22nd* It would appear from thio thnt two (anfl, from oui&gt; ixslnt of vlorr, the tv/o moot important) of the Trucinl Shaikho have duly satisfied the reauiroment of paragraph 5(c) of your letter No.P.Z.8858/35 of i'eaember ll’th, 1956. Two more, the Shaikhs of Sharjah and /ijmen, will probably conform sooner or later. The aha.ikh of Ras-ol- Kheiraahf on the other hand, takes the opposite attitude. If, as is to be presumed, you withhold the consent of aii; li; jesty's Government (v/hethcr temporarily or permanently ns dictated, by their attitude) from the Options of these Rulers who do not give the necessary security undertaking, what effect do yon conceive this would have on our activities and obligations under these Options in the meanwhile? May we safely assume that our geological exploration - which, probably based on Dibni, we expect to initiate early in November - may proceed over the territories of Sharjah at least and perhaps those of Rao-ftl-Khalmah, provided thnt our geologists adhere to a program* approved by the Ruler at the time?

I should be glad of your views on this point. informed as soon as possible that His Majesty’s Government see no objection to draft concession in final form. Do you see any objection to proposal (on which Fowle is also being consulted) that Shaikh should now be informed that there is no objection to his signing concession with text as now agreed provided he makes his signature subject to subsequent approval of His Majesty’s Government.

Translation of an extract of the report received by me. On the 22nd jamad al Auwal one mr.packer of I.p.C-arrived at Dubai with Major Holmes. They were the guest of sheikh saeed. As an outcome of their discussions re accommodation, it was decided that he should occupy the rooms of Al Marban hariz situated West of Dubai. X understand that Mr.packer is planning to construct a pier in the neighbourhood of the M awali rooms at ‘Shedegha* for discharging the company*s Machineries,equipments etc. A sum of Ks.700,000/- is said to have been provided for this work. Xt is rumoured that sheikh saeed has secured the contract for this job. Mr .packer left for London by Air and will return back after a month and a half. major holmes has at last attained his desire by his obtaini« the Oil concession for Bubal by means of bribery to those who are attempting to counteract public interests for their personal benefits. Through such people Sheikh saeed was persuaded to grant the concession by receiving a sum of Bs.60,000/- da y ° r signing the agreement, Rs.25,000/- per annum for 3 years, Rs.200,000/- as bonus on discovery of oil plus RS.3/- against a ton of oil extracted and Annas 4 per ton as Royalty thereon, in addition to the above amounts, a sum of rs. 15,000/- has been alloted for distxikxikimm payment to the Ruling family. As regards other conditions, x hope to be able to intimate yoa in my next report. choiirh GAAfid has nromlsed Major holmes to render him his conditions and terms.A net, appertaining uubai Agreement, was set up by Major tiolmes along with his cleric Ashraf and their spies Mohamed sherif, Rais Mohamed Rasool and Husain Amad. ihey had rumoured that the conditions agreed upon by both parties were included in the Agreement form despatched to the press in Egypt for printing* ihe forms were received and the Agreement was put before Sheikh saeed for his signature* The people warned their Ruler to beware of dmcstt being deceited by Major Holmes and his party* Accordingly the sheikh on going carefully through the Agreement he was surprised to see that the conditions demanded by him were not inserted therein* One item only was specified vis Re*R.A*¥* n&amp;se* he Immediately knew of the deceitful way they wanted to make him sign the Agreement and told them frankly of the fact and refused to sign until the agreement form is fully completed* a&amp;jor Holmes seeing that his trick being discovered, he was much disturbed fearing the Sheikh to change his attitudes, xhe Agreement wss therefore returned back to Egypt for re-printing the clauses in full* sheikh saeed seems to be inconstant of mind now* M&amp;jor nolmes presented watches to the Sheikhs of Abu - Dhabi.

The Residency Agent told me this morning that the Shaikh of Dibai had asked him if he was correct in signing the concession which Major Holmes has been negotiating before it had been approved by His Majesty’s Government or if he should obtain Major Holmes’ agreement to a letter to the effect wired to you this afternoon. If no reply is received by the Residency Agent before Tuesday I have instructed him that the Shaikh should make it clear in writing to the representative of Petroleum Concessions Limited that the provisions of paragraph 3 of the letter addressed to all the Trucial Shaikhs in April by the Political Resident (I think the 14th April) must be fulfilled before the agreement can be considered as binding. 1 drew Holmes’ attention to the necessity for His Majesty’s Government’s approval and he said that he had left that part of the negotiations to his people in London and presumably they had obtained appraral. He has heard this evening that his final draft concession has been lost in the H Scipio* and is very upset as he hoped to leave here on Yednesday. He showed me a wire this evening that he was sending to London which wa 3 not in accord with what I had said to him and he has promised to alter it accordingly. Holmes is worried about His Majesty’s Government having to approve his concession and I gather that he has been delayed by the Shaikh pointing out certain oraissions(l hope unintentional) in the final draft agreement which necessitated it being reprinted in Cairo. Holmes is anxious to leave and will leave without the concession/ ~JC^c£«g£. Telegram sr i*rom Political Resident, Buahire, at Shiraz. rji 0 H. M. *8 Secretary of State for India, London.

Yiy dear Claus on, With reference to our telephone conversation of this morning, I enclose the t ext of the Dubai Concession, as already seen and approved by you, and the final text, as now awaiting signature at Dubai. The former is dated 19.1.36, on the cover, which is pale green; the second is undated and has a white cover. I have marked in the latter copy, with red pencil, the points which are added to , or altered from, the earlier draft. It would be very greatly appreciated if you could look at these aid confirm (in writing or by telephone) that the final draft contains nothing which will cause H.B.M.G. to withhold their consent thereto. The position at the moment is that the Shaikh of Dubai will sign the revised text if instructed by the Political Resident (through the Political Agent, Bahrain, who is reported to be now at Sharjah). Would it therefore be possible for you to cable to Bushire (or Bahrain, or Sharjah) giving your blessing to the revised text? I appreciate, of course, that none of this has anything to do with the Political Agreement which you and we shall subsequently enter into. It would be greatly appreciated if you could treat this matter as of some urgency. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) S.E. LONGRIC-C- Encls. Clauson, Esq. , India Office, S.Y.Mis) DU3AI C01TC5SSI0IC.

My dear Longrigg, I write iry/eply to your letter of the 24th August, F.C.29/64, about the Dubai Concession. We have looked at the modifications which have been introduced into the text of the Draft Concession as a result of the negotiations between Major Holmes and the Sheikh. There is at least one substantial change, namely the addition to Article 1C, which requires consideration. Prima facie it appears to us to be satisfactory, but the local political authorities may have views to express on it. i^or instance, it may be desirable for provision to be made for the Political Resident to be the final authority as regards the disposal of European employees of the Company who are alleged to have conmitted some offence; but this is a matter which may well be dealt with in the Political Agreement and in the Exchange of Notes between Kis Lcmgrigg, Esq., etroleum Concessions Ltd., City Gate House, Einsbury Square, E.C.2. Majesty’ s/ C IT 29 bY AIR MAIL ,. ' r 'Majesty's Government and the Sheikh. 2 . On the whole, therefore, and subject to any observations by the local authorities, we are disposed to the view that the text of the Concession as finally agreed contains nothing which will cause His Majesty's Government eventually to withhold their consent to it. Before, however, we do anything we are anxious to discuss the matter with Colonel Bowie who will be arriving in London on deputation early next week. We are accordingly telegraphing to the Political Resident suggesting that, subject to any observations he may have to offer, and if Colonel Fowle agrees, the Sheikh should now be informed that there is no objection to his signing the Concession with the text as now agreed, provided that he makes his signature subject to the subsequent approval of His Majesty’s Government. It will be explained to him that this approval will not finally be given until a Political Agreement of a satisfactory kind has been signed by His Majesty's Government and the Company and until the Sheikh has exchanged letters with His Majesty's Government on the lines of those relating to the Q,atar Concession, with the addition of a formal und ertaking/undertaking regarding the protection of the Company's employees. Tl'e substance of tlie Political Agreernent, except for the Refinery Clause (as to which we await a letter from you) has been agreed, I think, with the Company. 7 ; e will send you very shortly a draft text for your approval. The Exchange of hotes between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh will include the recognition by him of the Political Agreement and must therefore be subsequent to the conclusion oi tha.t Agreement* At the moment, therefore, the only thing that seems to be holding us up is the Refinery Clause. P.S. There is one small point which we ought to have raised before but omitted to do so. In connection with the draft Bahrein Lease Mr.Walton (in his letter to Mr.Skliros dated 19th March, P.Z.1834/36), suggested Yours sincerely, ( S ' i M. J. Ci-AUSON that/I i n\ that 'Cognate substances” in Article 3 was a vague term and that something like 'everything which is extracted therefrom” would be better. Mr.Skliros in his reply of 2Cth Harch said he had no objection to the change. We had intended, of course, to suggest the change in all the drafts. There' would perhaps be no difficulty, if you agree, in incorporating this change in the Dubai Coneessionoie signature ?

Major Holmes happened to see the two Rulers concerned on August 27th, and cables to us in the following terms:- 'Both Rulers who are related dislike indeterminate nature as to what mulct would, be imposed therefore their objections to signing protection agreement until maximum of their liability is agreed.' Do you think it likely that the Political Resident will feel able to reassure the Shaikhs in such manner as may lead to their signature of the security clause, without 'which we do not feel our position to be wholly secure, either from the point of view of geological exploration of their territories, or from that of obtaining a long-term Concession from them?

Approval of H.B.M.G. without which Concession cannot be in force must v/ait for firstly India Office approval of text secondly Political Agreement between Company and India Office. Regarding text approval is being sought urgently and v/ill be probably forthcoming. Regarding Political Agreement this cannot be concluded within the next few days. On the whole I see little objection to payment of moneyby you on receiving Shaikh’s signature. His proviso in separate letter that validity depends upon consent of H.B.M.G. is necessary and not dangerous. Can his letter also state that money returnable in the event of^ H.B.M.G. consent being withheld? Hope that India Office will wire Bushire agreement to text with a day or two n • (2) P.C.L. telegram to Major Holmes dated August 25th, 1936 : ’’India Office have studied revised text and are likely to approve it provided Political Resident has no objection to last paragraph of Article 10. It is hov/ever always understood that final approval of H.B.M.G. is conditional on acceptance by Shaikh and by us of various conditions which will be embodied in subsequent letters and agreements. To this extent letter of proviso suggested by Shaikh appears inevitable and need not delay payment”• (3) P.C.L. telegram to Major Holmes dated August 27 th, 1936. ’’India Office postpone definite agreement to revised text until they can consult Powle which they expect to do on September 1st. India Office meanwhile is telegraphing Bushire interim and conditional agreement. India Office do not like thirtieth and thirtyfirst words of Article 3 and would like to substitute ’everything which is extracted therefrom’• Can you without difficulty make this change? (4)/2 . ( 4 ) Major Holmes* telegram to P.C.L. dated August 31st, 1956 ; 'I have to-day 12th Jamad Than! received letter from Ruler Duhai dated 10th Jamad Thani. First paragraph of letter states ’Holmes had told Ruler 10 days ago that there was only the letter of approval of H.B.M.G* which concerned Ruler to make concession effective’. Second paragraph states ’On the 8th Jamad Thani Holmes informed Ruler of receipt of telegram from S.H.Longrigg informing Holmes to take careful note that letter dealing v/ith oil concession agreement would also have to be agreed to and signed by Ruler Company and H.B.M.G.’ Third paragraph ’As you cannot inform me of contents of this second letter we after careful consideration have decided postpone signing concession until arrival of letter of approval from H.B.M.G. and of the above mentioned second paragraph of letter to be signed by Ruler Company and H.B.M.G.*. Fourth paragraph ’However in the meantime Ruler is prepared to initial separately each of the 27 Articles final draft Agreement as agreed between Ruler and Holmes but Ruler will not initial Agreement as a whole but if Holmes agrees Ruler will initial the Articles forthwith’. Holmes sees nothing harmful except period delay and recommends that Holmes initials the Articles with Ruler. Holmes feels strongly that the time has come for him to consult with London as Dubai area cannot be isolated because Dubai and Abu Dhabi are complementary to each other so any delay regarding completing Dubai will be compensated by avoiding same difficulties with Abu Dhabi. Holmes foresees considerable delay but the Ruler who is driven by his family is our staunch friend and therefore delay though disappointing is not harmful especially as it provides an interim during which Holmes can consult with London regarding whole position here which is not simple. I have opportunity going by boat to Kuwait 4th September as Airways is much disorganised. Intend taking above opportunity. The intense heat is becoming too much for me after 90 days of it and lately it has been excessive to almost an unbearable degree”. (5) P.C.L. telegram to Major Holmes dated September 1st, 1956 : ”Your telegram dated 31st August final ratification of Concession by H.B.M.G. must depend upon conclusion of separate subsequent Agreement between H.B.M.G. and Ruler as well as between H.B.M.G. and Company. You should secure Ruler’s signature to Concession and make payment if possible and accept any letter of proviso which he may address to you. If Ruler refuses signature you can adopt procedure described your telegram of 31st ultimo. Fully appreciate your desire to leave Dubai and look forward to your arrival here”• (6) Major Holmes’ telegram to P.C.L. dated September 1st, 1936 ’’Ruler Dubai has initialled 27 Articles separately of Concessi on Agreement. Holmes also initialled it. I am leaving direct for Kuwait by aeroplane 3rd September”. The/The last of these telegrams v/as received since I had the pleasure of seeing you and Colonel Pov/le at your office this morning. It appears to me that we shall now have a breathing-space in which to proceed with the Political Agreement 3 and your ratification of the text of the Concession. This should, I hope; mean that your definite approval and the Shaikh’s definite signature may be forthcoming v/ithin a few weeks. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) STEPHEN H. LONGRIGG M. J.

Petroleum Concession Limited Crucial Coast,Confidential Translation of letter No.C/526 dated 15th August 1936 from the Residency Agent Chare ah, to the Political Agent Bahrain. After Compliments. I beg to report the following for your information On ‘Tuesday the 11th August 1936 Ahmad bin Khalaf bin Utaibah arrived by lamch with a letter from Shaikh Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Said, Ruler of Abu bhabi, to Shaikh S a id bin haktum, O.B.S. , Ruler of lubai, in which he asked about the terms of the concession entered into between him (Ruler of bubai) and -*sgor Holmes, and added that he had sent to him Ahmad bin khalaf bin Utaibah with a verbal message. After reading the letter Ahmad bin khalaf bin Utaibah said to Shaikh Said that as an oil concession has been concluded, he was sent by Shaikh Shakhbut to enquire from Shaikh S a id about the territory granted to the Petroleum Concession Limited and about his (bubai’s) boundary. Shaikh Said said that he was closely connected with ahakhbut and that there was no difference between them. Ahmad said that as the concession has been concluded, the Company might send geologists and was afraid that the Shaikh of Dubai might send them with his guards into Abu bhabi territory while the Ruler of Abu Dhabi is responsible for their protection within his terrotory and in order to avoid future complications, he wanted that the boundary question should be settled before the geologists go out. On 22nd Uamad al Awwal 1355 (llth August 1936) Shaikh Said wrote to Shaikh Shakhbut asking him to return immediately and to bring his uncle Shaikh Hhalifah bin Laid with him, and that when he leaves Buraimi he should send a special messenger to him so that heySimself g 0 +o Abu Dhabi and settle the boundary question. Ahmad bin khalaf bin Utaibah left with the letter for Abu Dhabi on 12th August 1936. 3. The oil question on the -rucial Coast has opened the eyes of Trucial Chiefs and each of them tries to encroach—on the boundary of his neighbours and extend his territory so as to increase his revenues, ihere is no doubt that if their ^racial Chiefs) boundaries are not defined before the geologists go out, trouble would arise between them which might.lead to war.

On Saturday morning the 22th August 1936, he went to Subai and spent the whole day with Shaikh b a id bin l-aktum, o.S.g. 5 Buler of Dubai. He enquired from Shaikh Said bin ~aktum if he had signed the oil Concession and advised him not to give his final decision or sign it until he consulted all the Crucial Shaikhs. Shaikh S a id reminded Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of his signing the option agreement and also his cousin the Shaikh of Sharjah without .consulting him and said that he saw no reason why he should consult them in his own internal affairs, ohaikh Sultan bin Salim said that it.was in the interest of all of them that they should consult each other and stand firm in all matters, and that they should give a joint decision about oil, and that they should not give a blind undent aiding in regard to responsibility for the protection of the employees and property of the Company. He warned Shaikh ^aid not to run the risk of giving the undertaking asked for by the Government lest he may have to pay As.50,000/- for the life of one of the employees who may be insured for a large sum of money. * He advised Shaikh S a id bin .iaktum to keep the matter pending for three months. Shaikh S a id said that he consulted uis own people who have accepted the terns of the oil concession2 ni) (JiQ and that he was not bound by any outside opinion. In the evening bhaikh bultan bin oalim crossed over to baira quarters and visited —uhajnmad bin Ahmad bin -^alnuk, father-in- lav/ of Shaikh S a id’s daughter, and after coffee he v. r ent to the house of one Abdul Aziz an kajdi, where shaikh Lani’, cousin of the Riler of Dubai went to see him and had a long talk with him during the night and also the next morning. Shaikh Hani * is against the grant of the Dabai oil concession on the present terms. 4. On Sunday evening the 30th August 1236 shaikh sultan bin oalim returned from Dubai and sifter satying about an hour with Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah he went to Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan ’Amad in his house and had a private talk with him for about an hour* He enquired from Khan ^ahib Husain about Kalb a and, according to Husain, he told him kShaikh Sultan bin Salim; that the matter is considered as settled. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim then went to Salim bin Khamis (maternal uncle of the Shaikh of Sharjah) and at about 11 o ' clock left in his motor lorry for Has bl! Khaimah. I have not been able to discover what other talks he had with Khan Sahib Husain, but on the 31st morning I came to know that Khan Sahib Husain had arranged to go to Has al Khaimah with Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, on Saturday the 5th September 1S36 or after him within a day or two. Today I asked Husain if he has any intention of going to Has al Khaimah and he replied ambiguously that he might go in his car with the Shaikh on Saturday or go to Abu Iqisa Island and then to Has al Khaimah or to Has al I Hi aim ah and then to Abu Hus a, but that he was sending his cousin Kuhammad bin Hajab by car to visit huhaimad bin ’Abdul ’Aziz, the clerk of the Shaikh of Has al Hhaimah who is his friend.

I have received a report from Residency Agent, Sharjah, stating that on hearing that Shaikh Sa f id bin Maktum of Dibai had granted an oil concession, Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Bhabi sent a letter and verbel message to him asking what territory he had granted. Shaikh Shakhbut asked that the boundaries might be settled before geologists go out, as he would be responsible for protecting them within the limits of Abu Dhabi and he feared that Shaikh Sa» id might send his armed guards with the geologists into Abu Dhabi territory. Shaikh Sa»id of Dibai has suggested that he should go to Abu Dhabi as soon as Shaikh Ghakhbut’s uncle, Shaikh Khalifah bin Laid, (wit out whose advice Shaikh shakhbut will not do business) returns from Buraimi, in order that they may settle the boundary question. 3. / S 41 DCFP-i 1 24S&amp;i&gt;__(M-13H)-4-8-32...]2,U00.

Dear Mr.Longrigg, . v Would you kindl^refer to your letter of the 13th August, Lo.P.C.28/47, about the Trucial Coast Options. It appears to us that as the Option Agreements are suoject to His Majesty’s Government’s approval, the Company are under no obligation to make payments to a i.uler whose Option His Majesty’s Government do not approve on the ground that he does not accept their stipulation regarding the protection of employees. But we should like to discuss the question of the effect to be given to the Option Agreements in these cases including the difficulty about geological exploration with Colonel Eo 7 /le whom we expect in London at the beginning of next month. May I defer a final answer to you till then ? Yours sincerely, wngrigg, Esq., Petroleum Concessions Ltd., City Gate House , J, G. WALTON Finsbury Square, E.C.2.By Air Mail.

The fiiuincial terms are presumably largely a matter lor arrangement between the Company and the Sheikh and 1 am not sure in the case of the frucial Sheikhdoms how far we are justified in raising question* with the Company on these terms, subject, however, to the important point mentioned below, they appear on the whole to be fair and reasonable* modification made in the original draft of the oyalty Clause is that until the Company declares the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, or is deemed to have done so on obtaining the substantial production of 2,GCC tons , er day, they would not, as 1 understand the position, have to &gt;(xy any royalty at all on their production. They would merely pay the Annual sum oi xis.&lt;ch,oCO which would, be a somewhat poor return for a production of say 1,000 tons per day. I imagine that this is simply a drafting error in the revised Article 5(c), as the original draft Concession provided at all stages for annual payments or royalty at Hs.5 per ton, whichever is the greater and I suggest that the point should be mentioned to the Company on that assumption. A further point is that, as in the v v at&amp;r Agreement, it The important point which results from the2 . seems desirable to maintain the principle of having a separate provision for the payment of royalty on natural gas produced and sold and for this purpose a royalty of Annas 2 per 1,000 cubic feet appears suitable and mi.^ht be suggested to the Company. J Phla would entail making a consequential amendment to Article 5(d) so as to exclude natural g&amp;s from the 'substances” won and saved in respect of which the draft provides for royalty at the rate of He. 3 per ton ] Of course^ it is not likely that any natural will be sold in these territories for a considerable tiiiie, if ever, but in concluding an Agreement which may run for 75 years the point is one v/hich X suggest might be put to the Company, A technical point which has occurred to us in going through the draft Concession is that it seems desirable that there should be a provision on somewhat the same lines as in paragraph 5 of the Third Article of the Qatar Agreement to the effect that 'accurate geological maps, and records of the wells drilled, should be kept, which should be open to inspection by the Sheikh or his authorised rex^resentative.'

Jsual Snding,IMMEDIATE INDIA OFFICE, 2,6412/36 WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 24th September, 1936. My dear Longrigg, With reference to the Meeting at the India Office yesterday between yourself, Mr. Packer and Major Holmes on the one side, and Colonel Fowle and myself on the other, I write to confirm that we desire to suggest the following amendments in the text of the Dibai Commercial Concession as finally initialled by the Sheikh and Major Article 5(c) . We pointed out that there appears to be a drafting error in this Article as revised. The original draft Concession provided at all stages for an annual payment ^or royalty at Rs.3 per ton, which ever is the greater. The new Article does not provide for any royalty payments at all until the Company declares the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, or is deemed to have done so on obtaining the substantial production of c-,000 tons per day. It was agreed that the Company would Longrigg, Esq., reconsider/ Holmes. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., City Gate House, Finsbury Square, E. C. 2.2 . reconsider Article 5(c) with a view to meeting this point. A further point which we raised in regard to Article 5 is that it seems desirable, as in the Qatar Agreement, to maintain the principle of having a separate provision for the payment of royalty on natural gas produced and sold, and, for this purpose, a royalty of Annas 2 per thousand cubic feet appears suitable. This would entail making a consequential amendment to Ar , ) so as to exclude natural gas from the 'substances’ 7 won and saved in respect of which the draft provides for royalty at the rate of Rs.3 per ton. It was agreed that although the point is largely academic, the Company -- • -- ‘ j - ^ position made more or less the same as in Bahrein, where alcohol can only be imported by permission of the Political Agent. 'Permission of the Political Agent 71 should therefore be substituted for 'permission of the Sheikh 17 . Alternatively, if this is not acceptable to the bheikh, the words 'and the Political Agent or any Authority deputed by him' should be inserted after 'permission of the Sheikh'. it/(2^ 3. It was agreed that there ought to be no difficulty in making one or other of these amendments. Article 10 , p aragr graph 5. We pointed out that while the Company have, of course, every right to dismiss any of their employees, they cannot be given judicial powers of deportation. It would not, therefore, be possible to agree to the sentence ;, The Sheikh may request the Local Representative of the Company to send the person concerned, if a foreigner, out of the State of Dibai ,T . In this sentence we suggested that the words 'Political Agent, Bahrein' could be substituted for 'Local Representative of the Company'. As a consequential amendment the last sentence of the paragraph should be omitted. It was agreed that the Company would consider these suggestions which, prima facie , appear^to be acceptable. Article &lt;:5 . We mentioned that it was desirable that the bank in question should be a British one, provided that a British bank was prepared to open a branch. It is proposed to insert a suitable provision in the Exchange of Notes between His Majesty’s Government and^the Sheikh. Article 25 need not be altered. ^ We referred to your letter to Mr. Walton dated 14th September/lib September in which you suggested a draft Article designed to cover the position which would arise in the case of a dispute in regard to the boundaries of the various Sheikhdoms, and explained that this draft additional Article had apparently been overlooked. It was agreed that this Article should be added to the draft Concession. Two further points were mentioned which were left for further consideration by the India Office. One was a suggestion put forward by us that there should be a provision on somewhat the same lines as in paragraph 3 of the third Article of the Qatar Concession, to the effect that accurate geological maps and records of the wells drilled should be &gt;o£) p i e4, which should be open to inspection by the Sheikh or his authorised representative. We understood from you that you felt serious objection to this suggestion not because you wished in any way to conceal from the Sheikh any information which he, or his representative, might legitimately require in respect of the Company’s operations, but because you feared that if confidential maps and records were communicated there would be a grave danger of their falling into other hands than those for which they were intended. * v e have considered5. this matter again (which is, after all, a comparatively small one) and we do not wish to press it on the Company, in spite of the fact that the provision already exists in the Q,atar Agreement. 7/e feel that the Sheikh may safely rely on the Company treating him fairly in this respect; and if he or His Majesty’s Government ‘were at any time to feel that due diligence was not being shown by the Company in working the Concession, the matter could quite well be taken up, even without a specific provision of this kind in the Concession. The second point was raised by you. You asked whether we wished to insist on the change of the phrase d 'cognate substances” in Article 3. After further consideration of this matter with our technical advisers, we feel that it is unnecessary to make this alteration. This point is also a very small one. You will no doubt let us know as soon as possible whether you are prepared to make the alterations in the Commercial Concession which were suggested at the meeting and detailed above.

I shall assume otherwisethat you have not. As r egards the political agreement, I enclose a copy cf a draft letter which we are proposing to send to Longrigg.

The following amendments appear Arti c le 5(c) .- The two alterations suggest Starling in his letter of 4th September, 7 , should be made. Article Jisl- - This should be altered and the position made more or less the same as in Bahrein, where alcohol can only be imported by permission of the Political Agent. 'Permission of the Political Agent' should therefore be substituted for 'permission of the Sheikh'. Alternatively, if this is not acceptable, the words 'and the Political Agent or any authority authorised by him' should be inserted after 'permission of the Sheikh'. Article 10, para. 5. - Colonel Fowle notes as follows; 'While the Company have of course every right to dismiss any of their employees they cannot be given judicial powers of deportation, which is what the relevant sentence in this paragraph comes to:- 'The Sheikh may request the local representative of the Company to send the person concerned - if a foreigner - out of the state of Behai 1 . These powers should be reserved as they are in Bahrein under the Order in Council to the Political Agent, Bahrein (he is the nearest political authority). In the relevant sentence the words ’Political Agent, Bahrein' instead of 'local representative of the Company' might be suostituteu.This point, however, brings up the whole question of our legal pov/ers on the Trucial Coast which are of course nil, since we have no Order in Council there. We may have to have an Order in Council for Debai (as well as ±or the other States of the Trucial Coast where oil is found) as we have had to have one for Qatar, but I think the change in the wording of this article which I suggest would be a useful step in getting the Sheikh to recognise one at least of the powers which we shall have to get by Order in Council. I suppose, however, that from the legal point of view even though the Sheikh agrees no one can legally be deported until an Order in Council containing that proviso has actually been published. i? In addition to the amendments suggested by Colonel Fowle, it is agreed that the last sentence of the article should be omitted. Article 35 .- Some provision should be made that the bank must be a British one, provided that a British tank is prepared to open a branch. This might well be inserted in the exchange of Notes with the Sheikh, and it is unnecessary to make any alteration of the commercial agreement. A fresh article should be inserted on the lines suggested in Mr. Longrigg’s lette.r^to Mr. Walton dated 14th Ma y• A copy of this was enclosed in the express letter to the Government of India dated 20th May, P.

A copy has been sent to byf INDIA OFFICE, f.Z. 7015/36, VffilTEHALL, S.W.l. 29th September, 1956, t . Dear Starling, Would you kindly refer to your letter of the 18th September, P.D.775/1 Part I, enclosing a revised draft Refinery Clause for the Debai Political holiday at the end of this week raised the question again yesterday and is anxious to get an early decision. I took the liberty of showing him the revised draft with a view to seeing whether, subject to Admiralty approval, it would be acceptable to the Company. He acknowledged that it was an advance on the previous draft, but he felt very strongly that it still leaves the Company under the threat of having to erect a refinery, even if it would mean losing a great deal of money over the proposition, merely to suit the strategic convenience of His Majesty's Government, He said that the Company saw no particular Agreement. Longrigg, who is, I think, going away for a difficulty/ Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, S. W. 1. m AIR MAILd difficulty about erecting a refinery if they had some outlet in view for the refined products and he suggested that one method might be for tanks to be put down adjacent to the refinery which would be Admiralty property (a rent being paid ior them by the Admiralty) and would be kept filled by the Company for Admiralty requirements. In that case the refinery need only be of a capacity sufficient to fill the tanks witnin a reasonable period and the amount of storage required would be laid down by the Admiralty. This, at first sight, seemed a promising idea, but on examination it looked to me as if it might merely be a method of saying in other words that the Company would put up a refinery and store refined products provided the Admiralty would guarantee to buy the oil. 2. After some discussion Longrigg suggested tentatively the following possible compromise between Government's requirements and the Company's interests. He would suggest omitting everything after 'refineries' in the first paragraph and substituting 'unless the Company can show that/ 2 ., @ (f§) 3. that this would be precluded by commercial considerations'. Instead of specifying the capacity in the first paragraph he would add after the words 'location for' in the first sentence of the second paragraph the words 'and scale and products of'. 5. The object of tnese modifications would be to protect the Company from having to enter into an entirely uneconomic project, while leaving on them a definite obligation to erect a refinery unless commercial considerations are patently opposed to it. As regards the actual output of the refinery, the object of the suggested amendment is to leave this to be settled when the time comes in the light of the existing circumstances (e.g. His Majesty's Government’s requirements, any provision that might be made for local storage on the lines of paragraph 1 above, available markets, etc.). 4. As we are presumably agreed that His Majesty’s Government would not, in fact, be able to insist on the Company erecting a refinery if it would mean a dead loss to them, I should have thought there was sone thing to be said for adopting some kind of a compromise wording on the lines suggested. 77hat we want to do, I imagine, is to alter the Qatar clause in such a way as to put on the Company/4. Company a positive obligation to erect a refinery unless c 0 i.-.j.uGrcial considerations loroid. it instead of a rather negative obligation uo consider the matter if commercial considerations suggest it. ' nv ... V ihei e are two other points which Longrigg li^s raised. (1) In regard to the area to which the refinery would refer, he assumed that we should not include the Koweit Neutral Zone and Muscat. I said that I thought that we had in mind the Iruoial Coast, Qatar and Bahrein. Do you agree that the 500,000 tons should be reckoned on this basis? (I am not sure by the way about Qatar, as this is already covered by the Qatar Political Agreenent, but Longrigg expressed no doubts about it). (2) Longrigg feels rather strongly that it is desirable to have the Refinery Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company separate from the individual Political Agreements covering the individual concessions. There is nothing in the Refinery Agreement which needs the consent oi the Sheikhs and he feels it might contuse their minds. Moreover, he feels it might encourage them to exert embarrassing pressure on the Company to erect a refinery in their own particular Sheikhdom/Sheikhdom. I do not think there is very much in it either way, hut presumably there will be no objection to having the Refinery Agreement separate, and indeed it might be a more logical way of arranging matters than having it in each individual political Agreement. After all it is an agreement between Kis Majesty’s Government and the Company covering all concessions which the Company may now or hereafter acquire in the |area in question. Do you see any objection to having la separate Deed? 6 . I am sending a similar letter to Seal and a copy to Brenan. Yours sincerely, (Sgd') NL J.

I,ty dear Claus on, At our meeting in your office a few days ago, when Colonel Fewle was present, you suggested that I should send you a summary of our proceedings, actual and intended, in the region which concerns the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. You are, 1 think, already fully informed on the subject, but perhaps, as you suggested, your information is contained in acattered reports which it would be convenient to summarise. I will therefore do thin . In the Neutral Zone, immediately South of the Kuwait Principality, we hoped, early in the present year, to obtain a Concession for the Sheikh of Kuwait's half-rights over the territory^ for whic h purpose we drafted a Concession and sent you a copy. Later, however, when our negotiator, Major Holmes, was actually in the field, we were led by the advice of the Foreign Office to renounce the idea of a Concession, in view of the delicate inter-state position of the Neutral Zone, and to ask merely for an Option on the Sheikh f s rights. This, in May, it seemed certain that we could obtain. At the last moment, however, the Shaikh refused to sign (tempering his r efusal with many friendly expressions) and said he would prefer to leave the question temporarily in abeyance. The reason, we believe, was that, owing to his increasingly friendly relations with Ibn Saud, the/the Shaikh hoped for the re-incorporation of the Neutral Zone in his own territories (as was the case previous to the de-limitation of the zone) and thus for the power to bestow, not half, but the whole. Both he and ibn Scud are convinced that the Neutral Zone is rich in oil. We shall probably return to the charge later in this year, in the hope that the Shaikh will have modified his position. in the Bahrain group of islands, we intend to obtain a Concession for all the territory (including territorial waters) not already leased to the Bahrain Oil Company. Contact was made with the Shaikh by Major Holmes and certain amendments to our Braft Concession - of which you were given a copy - ..ere made by the Shaikh. With these we can probably agree. On the financial side we have made what we consider a generous offer, but have not yet the Shaikh’s reply. 1 am hoping to discuss the revised Draft and offer with Mr. Belgrave within the next few days. The question of ownership of Hawar island was reierred by us to you, and you have replied that it should be considered as Bahrain territory. The Company proposes to make Bahrain the administrative headquarters of its activities, not only in that Island, but in the whole Persian Gulf area. It is therefore shipping to Manama the necessary equipment for the drilling and geological parties proposed, of which details are given below. Mr. k.V. Packer, whose appointment as Company's Manager in that area you have already approved, has paid a flying visit to the Gulf, and will take up his residence at Manama on October 19th. He will be joined there a fortnight later by geologists and drillers, whose3. work (as will appear below) will be upon the mainland. Mr. Packer will arrange for his house and office accommoaation on his arrival, meanwhile occupying Major Holmes* hous^. We are at the moment taking in hand, through the Bombay Agency of the Anglo-lranian Oil Company, the recruitment of certain Indian personnel, which we think will be necessary for our office, our Qatar drilling programme, and our Trucial Coast geological programme. We have sent you under separate letter particulars of the Indian personnel we propose to import, and are anxious to observe the proper formalities in this connection. in the event of our importing &amp; limited number of rig-coolies from Iraq for work on Qatar, we shall obtain the necessary permits in the same way, but shall, of course, do our own recruiting in Iraq. The Company's interim Agent, pending Mr. Packer's establishment, is Haji Yus if icanu. The Qatar Concession remains, at the moment of writing, the property of the Anglo-lranian Oil Company, who obtained it early in 1935, and followed this by signing a Political Agreement with H.M.G. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. has now formed a subsidiary. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltu., with the object of taking over the Concession from the A.I.O.C. This proposal has, within the last day or two, r oCoived India Office consent, and letters to the Shaikh of Qatar, proposing that he agree to the transfer, are b^ing sent by the A.I.O.C. Abadan and, wc understand, by uhe Political Resident, The text of Abadan's letter will first have been approved by the Resident. P.D.(Qatar) Ltd. oxpectp, on transfer of the Concession, to assume all the/the obligations vis-a-vis H.M.G. and the Shaikh, which were previously incumbent on the A.I.O.C. One of these was the drilling o_i_ t»vo water—wc-i-ls on Q,atar, and this wc propose to carry out during the coming Autumn and Winter. Qatar will bo visited by two of our geologists, Messrs. T.P.Williamson and D. Glynn Jones, early in November, for the purpose of siting the wells in consultation with the Shaikh. These will be accompanied, or immediately followed, by Mr.O.S. Dickson, who will be in local charge of the drilling, and by Mr. W.St.G.Hombcrsley, who will supervise the drilling initially and by subsequent visits. The Company will take over the house already hired by the A.I.O.C. at Doha, and will ship from Bahrain the necessary motor vehicles and drilling and other materials. On the Trucial Coast two-year Options were, as you know, obtained by the A.I.O.C. during 1935 irom the Rulers ol live out of the six independent Sheikhdoms, Umm-ai-Qaiwain being the exception. You have, of course, copies of those Options which envisage the granting of a long-term Concession to the same or an associated company during the period. Copies of Draft Concessions for the purpose were supplied to you early in the present year and your permission obtained tor the arrangement of concessions by our negotiator, Major Holmes. The latter accordingly visited the Trucial Coast in June, found touch with most of the Shaikhs and took up his abode at Sharjah for three months. He found the Shaikhs largely preoccupied with the pearl-diving season, but was able to make considerable progress with the Shaikh of Dubai, whom he regards as one of the most influential. A Concession was arranged with Shaikh Maktum, the text of which has been c ommunicat e d/communicated, to you for your agreement. In the end each of the 27 Articles were initialled by the Shaikh and Major Holmes, but the Concession as a whole has not been signed. We understand that the Shaikh, having heard that he would be asked to enter into a further Agreement with H.M.G. on the subject, was unwilling to sign the Concession until he knew more of the Government obligations it would involve. We hope that all this may be satisfactorily arranged to permit of signature in the present Autumn, when Major Holmes will probaoly return to the Gulf. Meanwhile the Company hopes to arrange with you the terms of the n lolitical Agreement” which, we understand, will be necessary in the case of each of the Trucial Coast Concessions. The only point, v/e believe, upon which difference of opinion between the Company and H,M.G. may occur is in the matter of the latter’s requirement for a refinery to be erected on the Arab side of the Gulf, in connection with oil which may some day be discovered. On this matter the Company has recently addressed you in a separate letter. It is to be noted that only two of the five option giving Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast have yet signed the security clause propounded to them by the political Resident, thus securing H.M.G.’s ratification of the Options. The Shaikhs of Sharjah, Ajman and Ras-al-Khaimah have not yet signed. We have invited your attention to possible consequences of this failure to sign, and expressed rhe hope that the political Resident will be able to represent the matter to them in such a light that ..they will sign and thus permit ratification of the Options., Without this, we imagine, long term Concessions could scarcely follow, and our/' • : --KC'&amp;iVfc 6 . our field Fork in the meanwhile, be hampered, it is our indention to sena our geological mission named above io Dubai abour the middle of November, after they have si oed the Q,atar water-wells.

Major Holmes left the Trucial Coast on September Snd and Kuwait two or three aays later. He will be in Bngland tomorrow, September IBth, for a short visit of consultation and holiday. We have intended to approach the Sultan or Muscat and Oman lor a Concession similar to those proposed lor the Trucial Coast, but owing to his long absence at Dhofar, we have not yet been in touch with him. We have addressed you separately upon this point. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) Stephen H.Longrigg.

Hickinbotham, To Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain, The Honourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to report that Doctor B.M. Saigal came and saw me on the 5th of October 1936 and informed me that he was desirous of giving me important information. Ke told me that Hussain Yateem, who deals in pharmaceutical goods and is an agent for the Bahrain Petroleum Company* visited Sharjah during the last v/eek of Septembei*armed with letters from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa addressed to the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah. Dr. Saigal was at pains to explain that these letters merely mentioned Hussain as a person of standing here and asked the recipients to help him. His ostensible business was the collection of outstanding debts. Dr Saigal states that in addition to these letters he had one from Mr. E.A. Skinner, the Resident Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, appointing him agent for the Company and empower ing him to negotiate on behalf t&gt;f American oil interests. Dr. Saigal then said that he hal a long story to tell, so I askedjhim to come the following day and I enclose a copy of a note on his conversation with the Assistant Political Agent. x 2. I have asked the Residency Agent, Sharjah, to inform me by wire if Hussain Yateem discussed oil matters while/ I * '2 while he was on the Coast and if there was any truth in the statement that he was in possession of a letter from Mr. Skinner. I have not yet had a reply but have received a report on the visit sent from Sharjah on the 3rd October mentioning the gift of a gold watch to the 3 * 1 he ard on my way to Bahrain from Dubai on the 3rd of this month that Hussain Yateem had been to the crucial Coast and made very extensive purchases of wood on behalf of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, and it is poss ible that he had a letter from Mr. Skinner appointing him an agent and authorising him to make purchases on behalf of the Company. I will keep you informed of the course of events. -^ r * Saigal has wandered extensively in Arabia and was in the Yemen for some time. He had been employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company up to the 30th Marchjl935. He is not doing well and has applied to be appointed Government medical officer on the Trucial Coast. He is also anxious to start a practice in Dubai. Shaikh of Sharjah. 3. I heard Sir, Your most obedient servant, I have the honour to be, c , pt , ln Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain.Substance of a statement made by Dr. B.M. Saigal to the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, on the 5th October 1936. When Major F. Holmes was Chief Local Representative for the Bahrain Petroleum Company, Hussain Yateem and Saigal frequently went to Doha with letters for the Shaikh of Qatar, from Holmes, who was then negotiating with Qatar on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate. Hussain Yateem was then very friendly with Holmes, who sent him to England for education; but later he came under the influence of Skinner, when he was employed as an interpreter at Jabal, and gave away the secrets of the Qatar negotia tions. He is now thoroughly anti-British and pro- American. 2. During the visit of certain Trucial Shaikhs to Bahrain last year, Hussain entertained the wazirpf Abu Dhabi several times. One Mohammed Rasul, of the firm of Haji Rais Hasan, of Dubai, came to Bahrain on his own business, and took letters from Hussain Yateem to the Wazir. Saigal saw a letter from Mohammed Rasul to Hussain Yateem saying ”your letter has been forwarded to Abu Dhabi” 3. A month ago Husain Yateem got a letter from Shaikh Mani 1 of Dubai, written after they had come to terms with Holmes, saying u We tried to keep our promise, but Allah willed otherwise”. Majid, Kuwait subject, si clerk of Husain Yateem, showed this to Saigal. 4. When Hussain Yateem went to Sharjah a week ago, he took a letter from Skinner to Sharjah about oil concessions, and letters from Shaikh Hamad to Sharjah and Dubai, recommending them to their good offices. He also took presents. He plans to wait a week, and then send Majid. 5./5. Saigal also told me a story which seems to mean nothing, but may possibly fall into line later. One G.M. Khan, British Indian subject, friend of Saigal* s, was shown a letter by a man who subsequently gave his name as Ahmed bin Mohammed. This letter was from Ahmed to Mohammed Yateem at I Kuwait, saying that he (Ahmed) had authority from a friend of the Shaikh of Sharjah, one Ibrahim bin Rashid, to negotiate with an American Company. (Ibrahim is a pearl merchant, who comes annually to Muharraq, and does business for the Shaikh of Sharjah, He was one day arrested under an Agency warrant for debt (1 lakh), but released on bail. He has now returned to Sharjah). G.M. Khan informed Belgrave of this in August 1935. Mohammed Yateem wrote to Majid to get into touch with Ahmed, and Majid has been in continual correspondence with Ahmed and Ibrahim. SD/ J.B. Howes. 6-10-1936.secret, IMMEDIATE, No. C/432-10/12.

Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain. Dated the 24th October, 1936. I nm writing to confirm my conversation with you and Mr. Skinner on the 2:!nd October 1936 at which Colonel Loch and Captain Hicklnbotham were also present. 2. You will remember that I informed Mr. Skinner that I had heard that at the end of September Husain Yateem had proceeded to the Trucial Coast. At Dibai he had approached Shaikh Sa*id bin Ifektum, the Ruler of that Sheikhdom, on behalf of 'an American Oil Company' and had asked the Shaikh to enter into negotiations with regard to an oil concession. The Ruler had replied that as he was in negotiation with Major Holmes on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Limited, he was not prepared to do so. Husain Yateem then proceeded to 3harjah where, though, as far as my information went, he did not approach the Shaikh on the subject of oil, he d istr ibuted certain presents, a watch and binoculars, to the Shaikh and local notables. 3. I asked Mr. Skinner if it was the Bahrain Petroleum Company who had sent Husain Yateem on this mission. Mr. Skinner assured me that this was not the case. 4. I informed Mr. Skinner that I was very glad to have his assurance for the following reason. As Mr. Skinner was aware the relations between His Majesty^ Government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company had always been of a most friendly and open nature. Therefore, to have aent f without informing the / • J.R.Smith Esquire, Chief Local Representative, Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., Bahrain.the Political Ree dent, an emissary to negotiate secretly with a Shaikh who was already negotiating with another Company, which had the approval of His Majesty’s Goverrment, would hardly have been in keeping with these relations.

I have no comments to offer on your In paragraph 4^ I cannot help feeling that the suggested text is slightly out of touch v/ith realities; ii* lor example, we have a geologist touring on the Trucial Coast, he will almost certainly find himself in greater or less contact with some of the six Trucial Coast Shaikhs, and will drink coffee with them, hire camels, arrange guards, etc. Perhaps it is not quite reasonable to ask him to do this in all cases through oar Chief Local Representative. Do you think that at the beginning oi the paragraph, and betv/een the words n the Company” and the words ”shall deal”, we should insert some such phrase as n over all matters of importance or principle 1 ', or w in all except unimportant or routine matters”? Secondly, instead of saying n he will be ordinarily resident in Bahrain” I suggest that we say 'he will bo ordinarily resident in 0 r Bahrain”. thirdly, I can hardly visualise that all the Company’s relations with this or that Shaikh shall be conducted proposed re-drafting of paragraphs 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8. through ii.ivx.w.’s representative. In such very outlying places it seems to me difficult deliberately to exclude the possibility of direct relations between the Company and/Hi 2 . Q.nd the Shaikh. Is it not morG a ease rfor keeping H.ii.G.’s representative fully inforaied ? and consulting nirri on all impoi'cant issues? ^ven to —day 5 you \ 7 ill agree &gt; our relations \7ith these Shaikhs arc not being conducted t hro ug h h. ti.

I should prefer n in any case in which the Company feels that the free movement of its personnel within the concession area is being unn&lt;jccsarily restricted” . The effect of the paragraph i ,&lt;3 &gt; admit, much the same, but the wording I suggest contains a reference to the fact that we shall, after all, have paid for the concession rights over the vh ole area. I note that you will be communicating with us separately about the Refinery Clause. I hope that this means that you are accepting my suggestion to separate the Refinery Agreement (which affects the whole ^.rab side of the Persian Gulf containing ten potential concession units) irom the Political Agreement which you and we are to make in respect of each individual such unit. It seems a matter from which the individual Shaikhs might very well be kept out - and the same applies, of course, to the pre-emption clause. Yours sincerely, n , Sgd. Stephen H.

Usual binding. 3 / ft/■ ft*. 7fh/‘y Kr.ClaUflon . Generally in regard to the commercial and political agreements for the Trucial Coast concessions, (^particularly Debai), though the latter overrides the former we want I think as little overriding as possible, u n nec es3arily disgruntle the hheikh, It is^jperhaps not ’^uch good our passing in the commercial agreement anything of importance which we know we will have to annul in the political agreement. 2, Taking the commercial agreement with Debai first. Once this is suitable tea our point of view Scc^dcci, it can for', mu t at is mutandis . »^)p«ttern for the other Truoial Coast Sheikhdoms where similar conditions prevail. The following comments occur to me:- Agticl e 1 (c)♦ This is important. There ™ay be air facilities required in the future, but I suppose it will be difficult to provide for these in the commercial agreement though something might be put into the political agreement to the effect that The Company will give due consideration to any air facilities required byH.M.G.' view of the contiguity of Debai with its next door neighbours, A.bu Dhabi and Shargah. At tic 1 e _5 _( c ). yree with Starling in his suggestion, vide letter of 4th September, P.Z.6412, that this article should be rectified. I also agree in his further remarks re payments of royalty on M natural gas produced and sold', but there is nothing apparent as to this in the agreement unless I h^ve overlooked it. Article 4. This seems a wise provision in Article/tn. at In 2 .^ Article 9 (a)&gt; You will remember that on behalf of the Bahrein Government we had some difficulty with the B.P.C. re the interpretation of their customs exemption clause. Here, however, it is laid down that the Company should pay on all 'personal clothing' etc., so I think the point is covered. Article 9 (c). This should be altered and the position made more or less the same as in Bahrein where alcohol can only be imported by permission of the Political Agent. The liquor control question is of some importance on the Arab coast and I don*t think that at Debai it should be left to the sole control of the Sheikh. If he is slack in his control and either his subjects (in spite of the efforts of the Company) take to alcohol, or the Company’s employees imbibe too much the consequei odium will fall in one way or another on us, and the local political authorities will have to deal with the results. I think, therefore, that after the word 'Sheikh' should ccme the words ' and the Political Agent, Bahrein, or any authority authorised by him'. Article 10. Third paragraph. While the Company have of course every right to dismiss any of their employees they cannot be given judicial powers of deportation, which is what the relevant sentence in this paragraph comes to:* 'The Sheikh may request the local representative of the Company to send the person concerned - if a foreigner - out of the state of Debai w These powers should be reserved as they are in Bahrein under the Order in Council to the P.A., Bahrein, (he is the nearest political authority). In the relevant f sentence the words 'Political Agent, Bahrein' insteadof 'local representative of the Company' roi^ht be substituted. This point, however, brings up the whole question of our legal powers on the Trucial Coest which are of course nil, since we have no Order in Council there. 'e may have to have an Order in Council for Debai (as well as for the other States of the Trucial Coast where oil is found)as we have had to have one for Qatar, but I think the change in the wording of this article which I suggest would be a useful step in getting the Sheikh to recognise one «t least of the powers which we shall have to get by Order in Council. I suppose, however, th^t from the legal point of view even though the Sheikh agrees no one can legally be deported until ah Order in Council containing th^t proviso has actually been published. Ar11 cle_, 11 (a). The last part of this is important. Civil aircraft are not allowed to fly over Coweit, Bahrein and Ifuaeat under proclamations issued by these Rulers, but we have not asked the Trucial Coast Sheikhs to follow suit. However, only aeroplanes used by the Company will be employed and I do not think th*t we need make any objection. Article 14(b). After local inhabitants of Debai and labourers from neighbouring *rab countries, we should, I think, ensure that British or British* Indian labour is employed in preference to foreign, e.g. Iraq or Persian. I suggest, therefore, wfter the words 'obey the law' might be inserted 'and then British subjects'; after the word 'employees' might be inserted 'who shall,unless sufficient c^use to the contrary is shown to H.tf.G. by the Company,be British subjects' or something to thf&gt;t effect. Article/Article 21. below, Article ^5. This i« covered by ry pnrasraph Bank. I think thrt a proviso should be inserted that the bank rauat be a British one,provided that a British bonk is prepared to open ft up there. [ / v 3.

Para.3 the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Deb © Prima facie, since Deb^i were given the required undertaking, vide ny letter of 9th July, P.Z.5642, there would see^ no reason why Shargah and Ras-al-Khaimah should not also agree. At the same time their request that they should know what is the extent of their financial commitments in the way of compensation, vide P.C.L. letter of 2nd September, P.Z.6366, is not unreasonable, and if we can hit on any method of assessing a possible maximum 1 would be inclined to let them hsve one. For the moment 1 do i not see how this maximum can be arrived at, and I think that Colonel Loch might be instructed to approach the Sheikhs of Shargah and Ras-al-Khaimah, pointing out that/2./ Mr. Packer called this morning and asked if I could advise him on a number of points and I told him that as Colonels Fowle and Loch would both be here later in the week I was unable to give him a definite answer but would arrange an interview with the Political Agent, Colonel Loch, for him. If possible for Thursday, the 22nd October. He told me that certain of his European personnel were travelling down on the next mail, i.e. the one due here on Wednesday morning the 21st. That they, the Company, proposed to start with Qatar. They hoped to proceed there during the next fortnight. Their Geologists were working on notes of a survey by the A.I.O.C. and woulc^no doubt supplement the known facts from their own observations. At this point he asked how negotiations with the Trucial Shaikhs would be carried on. He explained that he was referring to arrangements for guards and transport etc. I told himjthat I was unable to inform him. I said that I knew that the matter was under discussion in London but as far as I knew no result had u yet been arrived at but that the Political Resident, who was due here on the 19th October would no doubt have the latest information on that point. He said that they were going very deeply into this matter as regards the Trucial Coast but had neglected it as regards Qatar which was, after all, the first objective of the Company. I said that I couldjiot say any thing on that point without reference to the various agreements on the subject of Qatar but that any move thaljhe pro posed to make with regard to Qatar should be reported to me before any definite action was taken by him. I said that he should inform me in writing what the proposed^was and I would discuss the question with the Political Resident on his arrival.£i 2 . The next objective after Qatar was to be Dubai and Abu Dhabi* He told me in confidence ? a confidence which I would like respected, that his Company apparent ly were proposing to disregard the boundaries of the to move from Abu Dhabi or Dubai to Has A1 Khairnah irres pective of the fact that Sharjah and the northeim Shaikhdoms had not complied with the security under taking required before survey parties entered their areas* That the Company had told him in London that 4 the boundaries were nebulous and that they proposed to disregard them particularly in the case ofjthe Sharjah- Dubai boundary. I told himjthat as far as I hnew there would be every objection to their Survey parties entering the territory of Shaikhs who had not given the .required undertaking. He asked that on no account should his namejbe mentioned in connection with this statement. I think that he had received either instruc tions from London, or anticipated the receipt of them, which he knew to be against the conditions under which these geological surveys are being carried out and realised that in the event of any trouble ensuing with ihe Shaikhs he would probably be held responsible by both the Company and the Government and was worried about his position. He appeared to hope that the position would be cleared by us before he had to operate as directed from his headquarters but did not wish to appear as having informed me of the situation. He further stated that he understood that the Political work in this part of the world A be undertaken by Longrigg in person and that Holmes would not appear on the scene after the Spring. My interview with him lasted some three-fourths of an hour and I think that I have recorded the principal points. Trucial Shaikhdoms.

Co , it P.Z. 7265/36, / Cs r %v , The contents of Bushire express letters of the 23rd September, Nos.715 S and 716 S, were discussed with Colonel Fov/le on October 8th. It was agreed that he would discuss these matters with Colonel Loch on his return to the Gulf. Meanwhile the following tentative conclusions were reached:- ( a ) Boundaries between the Trucial Sheikhdoms. Colonel Fowle pointed out that in view of the smallness of the territories in question, there could not be any very substantial divergences between the boundaries claimed respectively by neighbouring Sheikhs. His general idea was that it would be best to get the Sheikhs to settle the boundaries between themselves if they can, starting with the Debai-Abu Dhabi boundary, and in this connection it was noted from Bushire express letter No.715 S that the Sheikh of Debai was proposing to go to Abu Dhabi to negotiate about the boundary. It seemed quite possible that an agreement might be reached and it was agreed that it would be well for the Resident to do anything he could to encourage such an agreement; but that if no agreement could be reached the Resident or an officer deputed by him v/ould have to arbitrate* Once the Debai-Abu Dhabi boundary was settled. Colonel Fowle thought the'others ought not to present much difficulty. As regards the activities of Petroleum Concessions Limited it was agreed that the operations under their option agreements would not be seriously inconvenienced by the lack of clearly defined boundaries. Difficulties would, of course, arise when it came to the operation of COPY ' ’i C' ASR MAIL concessions/ ofiA OCT ms 5 m . cLCtt ; .JfcBi TLT 2 concessions if and v/hen these were secured, hut these would he covered hy the Article which it is already proposed to insert in the commercial concessions under which the Sheikh in question will accept without reservation the decision of the Political Resident in regard to frontier disputes. ('b) Undertakings hy Sheikhs in regard to protection. It was pointed out that Colonel Loch’s express letter) ^ No.716 S had crossed the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 25th September, No.2750, in which it was suggested that a further approach might he made to the Sheikhs of Shargah and Ras-al-Khaimah, with a view to pressing them to give the necessary protection undertaking. Colonel Powle would discover from Colonel Loch whether any action had heen taken on this suggestion, and if so what the result was- He would do everything possible to smooths out any difficult' ’ the Sheikhs. It was noted that in his letter of the 13th August the Sheikh of Shargah had agreed that he would pay at Muhammadan rates for any harm done to the Company’s employees hy his Sheikhs should agree tc pay compensation in the event of casualties was merely to impress the seriousness of the matter on them and to ensure that they used every endeavour to give adequate protection to the Company. It was agreed that if it was impossible for the Resident to get all the Sheikhs to accept unlimited liability in regard to compensation it would probably be sufficient to make some arrangement on the lines of the Sheikh of on the compensation to which the Sheikh of Shargah would be liable the same limitation would of course in fairness tribesmen. It was agreed that the demand that the Shargah’s suggestion. If a limit of this kind were put have/have to he introduced in the cases of the Sheikhs who had already accepted unlimited liability. The above refers to the question of protection during the period of the options. The position during the concession period was also discussed and it was pointed out that the present proposal was to get from the Ruler, in exchange of notes at the time of the approval of the commercial concession, an undertaking in regard to protection on similar lines to that given in respect of the options. After discussion it was, however, agreed that • in view of the fact that Article 15 of the draft Trucial commercial concession binds the Sheikh to giving 'all protection in his power' to the Company and as the failure of a Ruler to implement Article 15 would of itself tend to invalidate the concession as a whole including the royalty clause, it was unnecessary to make any separate provision in regard to protection in the exchange ofNOTE BY COLONEL FO’TLE DATED 12th OCTOBER 1936, p» Z. 7363/(i6« BAHREIN OIL« Major Holmes lunched with me today, and stated as follows. (You know he is always rather vague). (a) That Mr.Skliros (P.C.L.) appeared to he of the opinion that the HA7AR ISLANDS by themselves would not be good enough, without the addition of the mainland territory. (b) That Mr.Skliros also thought, and Major Holmes rather concurred, that if the Bahrein Petroleum Company got any additional areas in Bahrein territory, before the Petroleum Concessions Limited had managed to fix their options and concessions, (particularly the options), on the Trucial Coast, this would encourage the Trucial Coast Sheikhs to intrigue with the Bahrein Petroleum Company with the object of giving options, etc. to them rather than to Dahrojrn Pe-troloum-Company— (c) That he - (Major Holmes) had received information from the Petroleum Concessions Limited's representative in Debai that soon after he - (Major Holmes) had left the Trucial Coast, an Arab on behalf of the Bahrein Petroleum Company had arrived at Debai and approached the Sheikh. The latter had replied that he had made arrangements with Major Holmes, and would not go back on them. (d) That Mr.Skliros hoped that there would not be too great a hurry over demarcating the boundaries of the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms, as this might complicate matters as between the Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Sheikhs. 2 . With regard to (a). Nothing can be done until Mr.Belgrave on return to Bahrein finds out from the Sheikh exactly what plan the latter has in mind. With/7 /ith regard to (~b)» I do not think that there is much in this, hut will discuss with Colonel Loch and let you have my views. Vfith regard to (c). If this is true that the Bahrein Petroleum Company have heen playing rather low down, 1 will endeavour to confirm in Bahrein, and report. V/ith regard to (d). This fits in with our views. 3.

GENERAL - Water Engineer Drillers and Geologists will be instructed to consult and take the advice of Haji Williamson on all security questions in connection with their camps and movements. Haji Williamson will be with the Qatar party for some time and later accompany the goelogists on their movements on the Trucial Coast. Haji Williamson will approach the Sheikhs concerned to duggest and appoint suitable guides and guards. At Qutar (outside Dohah) these will be taken from the tribal leaders. At Dubai the brother or son of the Sheikh will be asked to accompany the party. At Abu Dhabi,similarly,suitable members of the ruling families will be asked for. The principle that guides and guards are to be taken from the different tribes whose country is to be traversed will also be adhered to. The actual composition of guides and guards at any one time will depend very largely on the circumstances and places and no hard and fast rules are feasible. With due deference to the Sheikhs suggestions it will be endeavoured to restrict guides to one or two per party moving and guards not more than two per person, this number also being governed by circumstances and transport available. PAYMENTS TO GUIDES AND GUARDS . As a general rule head guides will be paid Rs.35 plus Rs.15/- ration allowance per mensem and guides and guards Rs.30/- plus Rs.15/-. Members of the ruling families accompanying parties will be recompensed with suitable presents. INS TRUCTIONS TO EUROPEAN &amp; OTHER FOREIGN PERSONNEL. Instructions to all personnel in English and Arabic will be prepared for communication when camps or parties are formed to include: (a) No movements of any distance will be attempted without prior consultation &amp; arrangement with the Sheikh. (b) No British or foreign person will move outside camp or away from his party without a guide or guards. (c) No ’’foreigner” out of camp will instruct guards to return to camp or leave him alone for any reason.(d) No ’Foreigner 1 will enter the towns or bazaars on foot,mounted or on vehicles without permission from in charge Party or Camp or without the official guards.APPENDIX ’D 1 ?

The main points of discussion being the clauses in the Political Agreement relating to protection of Company Employees, jurisdiction for expelling foreigners from Dibai, and the need for a British controlled Refinery in the Persian Gulf.Also under discussion is the question of boundaries between the Trucial Coast Shaikhdom’s and how best to settle them in relation to concession agreements; and reports of communications between the Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai and Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan [Shaikh Shakhbūt bin Sulṭān bin Zāyid Āl Nahyān], Ruler of Abu Dhabi with the intention of settling themselves the boundary between their respective territories which the Political Resident believes to be the best solution to the boundary question, provided they are able to reach a consensus.Correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf , the Secretary of State for India, the Political Agent Bahrain and Petroleum Concessions Limited discussing the protection undertaking required by the British Government before the options secured by the Trucial Coast Shaikh’s could be approved. The correspondence confirms the acceptance by the Shaikh’s of Abu Dhabi and Dibai of the condition; the refusal of the Shaikhs of Sharjah (Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qasimī) and Ras al Khaimah [Ra's al Khaymah] (Shaikh Sulṭān bin Sālim Āl Qasimī) to agree to the condition as it contained references to compensation without any upper limit or detail of amounts; and the non-response of the Shaikh of Ajman (Rāshid bin Ḥumaid Al-Nu`aimī) to the agreement.
