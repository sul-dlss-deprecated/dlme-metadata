It describes how the Resident was well received, despite an initial cool reception, and explains that the Resident believes that the Government of Fars is better disposed towards the British.Described in the letter is the Resident's reception by the Prince, and subsequent discussion with Zekee Khan. The letter details the focus of this discussion, which was the Prince's planned invasion of Bahrain; this includes information on the proposed invasion force, and explains that the Resident has made the British position of neutrality over the affair clear to the authorities at Shiraz.It is explained that the Resident does not believe that the expedition to Bahrain will take place; the Resident is confident that the recent earthquake, combined with a proposed visit by Fatḥ ‘Alī Shāh Qājār (which the Resident also does not believe will happen) will be used as an excuse to postpone it. It also notes that the Resident does not believe the Prince has been successful in securing the assistance of Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat, and that any activity will be confined to seizing control of Bushire.The letter also briefly describes the ruinous condition of Shiraz after the recent earthquake, and notes that the subsequent death rate is high as a result of exposure to the heat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x00000e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
