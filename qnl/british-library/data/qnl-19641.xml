Sir ,—I am directed to transmit, for information and guidance, the annexed Extract (paras. 28 to 32) of a Despatch from the Honorable the Court of Directors, in the Judicial Department, No. 8 of 1858, dated the 10th March, laying down the principles which are to guide the conduct of Public Officers in respect to matters concerning the Religion of the Natives of India.

While disbursing an ample proportion of the revenues which we derive from the industry of the people of India in support of our Ecclesiastical establishments there, and while by no means discouraging, or allowing our local Officers to discourage that free access of Missionaries to every part of India which has prevailed, without any restriction whatsoever, for nearly half a century, we cannot sanction the exercise, by any individual in the Service of our Government, of zeal exhibited in a form, which we are satisfied can only tend to retard real progress towards enlightenment and Christianity.30. We have never desired to restrain the contributions of our servants in India to charitable and benevolent purposes, or to any object deserving of a Christian's sympathy ; and we are well aware that in proportion to their means they are in the habit of bestow ing substantial proofs of such good feelings, in a degree which is not surpassed by the humane exertions of any class of persons in any country. But the line which we must require you to draw for the strict guidance of all our Officers in India is- a clear separa tion of acts of private conduct from those in which Official Authority may be inferred to have influence. 31. After the present course of confusion, anarchy, and bloodshed, some considera ble time may elapse before the minds of the people can again be settled on any subject relating to our administration of their affairs. We would urge you therefore to spare no pains in enforcing on all public Officers the most stringent rules of toleration. It is indispensable to the welfare of the British Dominions in India to maintain that condition of internal peace, under the influence of which our Native subjects so long lived,— generally secure and contented in perfect reliance on our good faith in abstaining from any covert designs against their religious feelings. 32. We have ever entertained a sanguine hope, that ultimately the healthy progress of society in India would be secured without compulsion, provided that every act of our administration is uniformly characterised by disinterestedness, morality, and justice; and that the country continue freely open to the benevolent exertions of Missionaries wholly unconnected either with the force of Civil Government, or the armed display of the Military Cantonments.
