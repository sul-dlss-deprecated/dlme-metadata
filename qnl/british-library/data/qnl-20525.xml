Political Agency, Banrain, the 12th May 1934. i From:- Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. To:- The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian &amp;ujf, at Kuwait. Subject:- Qatar Oil. Reconnaissance. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegrams Ko:450 dated the 2nd May and Wo:453 dated the 3rd May 1934. 2. Early on the 3rd May a special launch took a letter to Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani informing him of the friendly nature of the reconnaissance and asking him to warn his tribesmen to afford help in the event of a forced landing. On the 6th May I received a reply couched in friendly terms and only asking that the aircraft should fly high enough to avoid frightening camels or other animals, because, if their animals were to be stampeded, the bedouin of tribes not under tis control might not heed the instructions which he was sending to all of them. I passed this request and also certain information ibout the area, over which they were to fly, to the Officers Commanding the Qatar Reconnaissance Detachments of 203 (P.B) Squadron and 84 (B) Squadron of the Royal Air Force, Group Captain R.E.Saul and Squadron Leader S.P.fincent, (see my betters Nos:0/493-10/3 and C/494-10/3 dated the 7th May 1934). 3. On the 9th May the reconnaissance was carried out /wi thoutwithout incident and the results will no doubt be reported in detail by the Officers Conimanding and by the Senior Waval Officer, Persian G-ulf Division. i_accofflpanied G-roup Captain Saul in iiis Plying Boat, * i See Admiralty; which left Bahrain at 06.30 hours and proceeded Chart 2837b. ; * ^ — ^ over Hawar Island and thence across to just east ; of Zakhnuniyah Island. Studious care was taken not to cross the Sa'udi Arab frontier and the Plying Boat did not fly over either the island or over the G-ulf to the south of it. The Plying Boat then examined from the air Bohat Hamar, which should afford an emergency harbour, sheltered from all winds, with an extent of about 1200 x 400 yards. The Plying Boat then descended in the open sea off Salwa flfells, where there was a launch, which had been sent ahead trom Bahrain. About an hour and an half was spent in sounding and examining various reefs and shoals from the launch, but there does not seem to be any really good shelter from northerly winds. There is, however, a point behind which shelter could be had in an emergency. Thence the Plying Boat proceeded to and. descended on Khor al 'Odaid, where a considerable sheet of deep water was found with shelter from all sides, connected with the sea by a channel which could be used by motor launches. It would, however, be very hot indeed in the hot weather. The visibility was only medium - probably about five miles - and Sakak was too far south oi the line of flight to be seen. At 13.00 hours the Plying Boat reached Doha and descended near H.M.S Shoreham. 4. In the early afternoon of the 9th May Shaikh Hamad bin 'Abdullah came off to call on the Senior Naval Officer and brought a letter from his father, Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qasim, and a verbal explanation that Shaikh 'Abdullah, who had waited at Doha /forI © I 3. 3^ for two days (difficulty had arisen through the delays and uncertainties of launch conununication with Qatar)was at Urnm al Quhaib (an hour's motor drive in the interior), and was not well enough to come in again. It was arranged that I should go to see hira the next morning, accompanied by Group Captain Saul and the Officer Commanding, H.M.S Bideford, Captain C. Austin- Browne. b. Early on the morning of the 10th May we proceeded by car to Umm al Quhaib, where the Shaikh was living in bedouin style. I think that, though he is often troubled by his lee-, was his indisposition/on this occasion an excuse, partly due to the fact that he had already waited two days in Doha at a time of the year when he is not usually there and partly due to uncer tainty as to wJiat our activities portended. ^ ^ After coffee and tea I delivered orally ty'tne Shaikh, in the presence oi his sons Shaikhs 'Ali and Hama^ the message contained in the Secretary of State for India's'telegram No:1154 dated the and May 1934 and at his specific request sent to him on my return to H.M.S Bideford a letter containing the message. After an early meal with the Shaikh we returned to Doha. 6. Shaikh 'Abdullah appeared to me to be impressed by the message regarding Bin Sa'ud's eastern boundary and the British Sphere, but I had a feeling that it was not entirely fresh news to him. I will not trouble you with details of the conversation, but, though it appears that the news of Bin Sa'ud's victories has had a considerable effect on men's minds, it seems to me that Shaikh 'Abdullah is more inclined to our side than he was. I attribute this to his gradually realising, firstly, that His Majesty's Government are in earnest and, secondly, that they still possess the power to make their will felt and are prepared to use that power. He has still, however, I think, /lurking I4. ^ /I lurking doubts (and it is with much reluctance that I mention this aspect of the matter) whether we are in truth prepared to implement our words, if and when matters come to an head, and still fears that he may be committed to a course which will bring trouble upon him and then find himself without support; for he shares the view widely held along the Arab Ooast that we now only use ' Iral».tn n (words) and have lost our capacity for taking action. I recommend, therefore, that the delivery of this message should be followed after a short interval by a second air reconnaissance, which should be carried further into the British Sphere. Shaikh 'Abdullah asked me where latitude 20° north ran and I showed him very roughly with the help of the small sketch map which was used in your interviews with him; but I think that it would be wise to send him a map (not the official map) with Bin Sa'ud's boundary and latitude 20° north marked on it. If there is no objection to this, it would be convenient if you would telegraph to me the one word 'MAP', as if permitted to do so, I should like to send it at once. ii the He also enquired jghirthcr .-^l American geologists (whom he did not want to come near his territory) were to enter the British Sphere for surveying and if he (Shaikh 'Abdullah) were to tell the British Government, would they (the British Government) prevent them from doing so. I said that I certainly thought that they would and that he (Shaikh 'Abdullah) should inform me, if the geologists were to do so, and that I would then report the matter to Government. He said that he would like to have this request in writing, and that the information would have to be given secretlyas he feared the consequences, but I did not add it to my letter containing the message of Government. I recommend that I may be permitteo. to make this request in a further letter to Shaikh 'Abdullah.5. If 0 t v I would mention here that I gather from another source that the American Oil Companies send him papers and news showing how powerful, wealthy and so on they are, and that this pro paganda, backed by the talk of interested persons, has had a considerable effect on his mind. 7. When talking about the Yemen I told Shaikh 'Abdullah that, though tue advance of Bin Sa'ud's forces along the coast was, so far as I knew, true, many people thought that the T™'™ Yahya was not dead and that in Kuwait the news was only accepted with considerable reserve. I think that it would be well, if the news of the Imam's death proves false, for me to write to Shaikh 'Abdullah to tell him, and I would request that I may be informed by telegram when authentic news is received about it. 8. J enquired about the Akhwan settlements as directed, in your telegram No:462 dated the 5th May 1S34. Shaikh 'Abdullah says that there are two small Akhwan settlements at Sakak and Ambak, and that he knows of no others. He does not know how many people live in those places, but thinks that they are very few; and they are inhabited mainly by nomads wno live there during the summer and leave for grazing in the winter. He says that all the tribes within the area of the British Sphere and as far as Baraimi pay Zakat to Bin Sa'ud It is collected by small parties of ten men or so and no one dares to interfere with his authority. Shaikh 'Abdullah bin 'Isa told me in conversation recently that the people of Sakak used long since to be servants of the Al Khalifah Family, and are still in touch with them. He has two friends there, 'Ali and Muhammad bin Yabur, who are at the moment away in the Yemen. I will try to find out more from him later on. Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qasim maintained his old objection to aeroplanes landing at Raiyan (of which he is really nervous), tat has weakened to the extent that he ao^iesoed in Group Captain('44; 6. ^ Group Captain Saul looking over the area in question on our way back, and that he said in general terms (which should not be construed into a definite promise as regards Raiyan) that if and when arrangements were made with the Oil Company and with His Majesty's Government for protection, then he would let aeroplanes come. He also said that he was afraid that he might be held responsible for any damage caused to the aeroplanes by the ground, and that, if ever he did permit aeroplanes to come, he would want an expert to examine the ground and level it properly# 10• I venture to think that the time is opportune for a visit by an unofficial emissary of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, such as Hajji Yusuf Kanoo, on the lines of my telegram No:445 dated the 28th April 1934. I would suggest that Hajji Yusuf Kanoo might be sent by the Company to discuss matters generally and to try to find out what Shaikh 'Abdullah now thinks about the oil concession, and whether any bridge can be arranged between his and their terms. The accredited represent atives might then go down if the results obtained by the emissary show that it is a suitable moment and that there is a reasonable chance of a bridge being found. I think that the emissary should be sent while Shaikh 'Abdullah is still impressed by our unwonted activity and firmness, and that, while he is with Shaikh 'Abdullah, we might make the reconnaissance of the British Sphere mentioned in the sixth paragraph of this letter, and inform Shaikh 'Abdullah, as if through courtesy, that we are doing so. 11. In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity of drawing attention to the success of the arrangements made by the Senior Naval Officer and the Officers Commanding the Detach ments of the Royal Air Force for carrying out the reconnaissance, which will, I believe, prove to have a definite and valuable effect on the political situation. I should also like to thank /them7. W v them for their courtesy and hospitality to myself.

I appreciated when I sent my telegram No:477 dated /i the 3rd May 1934 to the Air Officer Commanding, that it was important that the reconnaissance should take place quickly after the communication to Bin Sa'ud. But I did not know that a communication had already been made on the 28th April (though the second paragraph of Sir Andrew Byan's telegram No:71 dated the 25th April, a copy of which was received on April , showed that he contemplated an early commun ication). Local action was taken immediately on the receipt of the orders contained in your telegram No:450 dated the ^ 2nd May 1934 (indeed, the telegram came about 20.30 hours in the evening and the launch left next morning for Qatar at 09.00 hours), and I trust that all will go well. 3. But I venture to hope that you will feel able to urge upon His Majesty f s Government that, should any such matter I arise in the tuture, it would be of great help, and possibly prevent untoward consequences, if local Officers could be given the opportunity to make their preparations before a communication like that to the Sa^di Arab Government is delivered. For I example, the aircraft might have been assembled here, and arrangements have been made to warn the Shaikh of Qatar, immediately the communication had been handed to the Sa T udi Arab I Government. i need not enlarge on the point, but it does seem /to me«(S)J to me so important that our aims should not be jeopardized by lack of coordination. i Honourable Lieut-Colonel T.G.Fowle.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 2nd April I spoke to the United States Amhassador in the sense of the instructions contained in your j despatch Ho.12^ of the 22nd March (l. 1839/1206/91) t relative to the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 regarding boundaries in Eastern Arabia. Mr.Skinner was most grateful for the ccmmunication which you had authorized me to make to him. He told me that he had been unable to obtain a copy of the unratified Convention of 1913 from the Turkish Government, who had searched their archives for it in vain, and said that His Majesty's Government should realize that matters of private interest, not of State interest, were behind the inquiries which his Embassy had undertaken, the interest residing in the concession of an important Petroleum Company. 2. It was obvious that nsy colleague knew nothing about the geography of the region in question. I emphasized the point that what I was showing him was the south-eastern frontier line of Turkish Arabia. His Sxcellency put no question about what was happening east of that line, so I did not refer to B1 Ciatar. He did enquire why the Ottoman GoYernment had not ratified the 1913 Convention, and on this point I was unable to enlighten him. I said, however, that as the 1914 _ . -r, w ■ ^ i Convention/ (copy forwarded to P.A.Eahrainunder p.l. t.. v* ^ ki No.C/213 of 15/5/34). 5 Right Honourable ri Sir John Simon, G.

I handed to Mr.Skinner, for retention, the copy of the 1913 Convention enclosed in your despatch, and lent him volume XI of Aitcheson's M Treaties w , a. further copy of which he said he would purchase for the use of his i &amp;nbassy. 4.

I HAVE the honour to state that I have received instructions from His Maiesty's Government in the United Kingdom to inform the Government of His Maiesty King Abdul Aziz, as a matter of courtesy, that the Government of the United States of America have recently asked them for information regarding the treatv basis of the territorial status and boundaries of certain territories and spheres of influence in Eastern Arabia, and have been furnished m reply with copies of the Anglo-Turkish conventions of the 29th July, 1913, and of the 9th March, 1914. I enclose, for convenience of reference, copies of these conven tions, the second of which was ratified and published. , , , It has been pointed out to the United States Government that while the Anglo-Turkish convention of 1913 was not ratified, the boundary laid down m article 11 of that convention is mentioned, adequately defined and definitely adopted in article 3 of the ratified convention of 1914, which in the view of His Majesty's Government remains operative. Since article 7 of , the 1913 contains provisions regarding the frontier of Koweit, the attration of the United States Government has also been drawn to the subsequent Koweit-Nejd Boundary Convention of the 2nd December, 1922.

As you will iiave heard, the air part of the reconnaissance was carried out, but unfortunately Loch was unable to arrange the testing out and marking of the proposed landing ground near Doha, although Group Captain Saul had taken marking material with him for the purpose, I fear that we have been too late and I r that the Shaikh has been overpowered by the American Oil Company and Ibn Saud. The latter' s prestige, I have no doubt, has increased of late on account of nis victories over the Yemen. It certainly appears a great pity to me ' that we were unable to send out an Intelligence officer to Quatar with the A.P• 0. C. whe n the ir land re connai ssance was carried out. We could have obtained practically all the information we wanted preparatory to drawing up an agreement of Protection with the Shaikh. 1 do not know what the A.P.O.C. propose to do with regard to a further reconnaissance, but I suggest that should a reconnaissance be projected, a B.A.i? 1 . Intelligence Officer should be allowed to accompany the party, in mufti if necessary. I was glad to hear that the land required for H.M.Gr. in Bahrain had been obtained without much difficulty.

The Residency, BUSHIRB, the 30th MAY, 1934. 'fyijf y ■ Many thanks for your personal IU0. of 14th May 1934. 1 don't think that it made any difference to the situation that an Intelligence Officer did not accompany the A.P.O.C. on their reconnaissance in Qatar, This situation as you know is as follows. ie are ready to ••• promise the Sheikh protection, but not until he gi^es the oil concession to the A.P.O.G. So far he has steadily refused to do thisfc (a) because the A.P.O.G. do not see their way to accepting his large financial demands. (b) because he is afraid of Bin Saud with whom he ' has certain vague and subterranean arrange ments which have rendered our offer of protection less attractive than it might have been. If an Intelligence Officer had accompanied the A .P.O.G. party it would not have affected the Shaikh^s views in any way, and we would have been exactly where we are now. 2. #ith regard to (b) above, I have informed the | / Shaikh on behalf of His Majesty^ Government that his arrangements with Bin Saud are against his treaty with us I and/ I Marshal O.S.Burnett, L t C.B.,0 .b .E., D.S.0., ^ r Off i cer Commanding, 'Iraq Command,BAGDAD.-2- and cannot be allowed to stand, and I hope that this combined with your reconnaissance the other day, and the fact that His Majesty's Government have taken a strong line in informing Bin Saud that the Eastern Boundary of Saudi Arabia is the Blue Line drawn due south from opposite Zakhnuniya Island, may have a salutary effect on the Shaikh. At the moment one Yusuf Kanoo, the Bahrain Agent of the A«P#O.C.j is at C^atar, having an unofficial talk on behalf of the Company with the Shaikh, and am awaiting the news of the result. 4. I think there wil^fbe difficulties about an &lt;Vvvu^ Intelligence Officer accompanying A.P.O.C.party. It would probably be better if he went^himself, andjif you want to send one I will see what can be done directly I hear about Yusuf Kanoo. I hope to be flying home by Imperial Airways on short leave about the middle of July and am delighted to accept your kind offer to put me up.V THIS DOCU MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT ''' £ ' 11 ' EAST ERN (A rabia).

I HAVE the honour to inform you that on the 2nd April I spoke to the United States Ambassador in the sense of the instructions contained in your despatch No. 125 of the 22nd March, relative to the Anglo-Turkish conventions of 1913 and 1914 regarding boundaries in Eastern Arabia. Mr. Skinner was most grateful for the communication which you had authorised me to make to him. He told me that he had been unable to obtain a copy of the unratified convention of 1913 from the Turkish Government, who had searched their archives for it in vain, and said that His Majesty's Government should realise that matters of private interest, not of State interest, were behind the inquiries which his Embassy had undertaken, the interest residing in the concession of an important petroleum company. 2. It was obvious that my colleague knew nothing about the geography of the region in question. I emphasised the point that what I was showing him was the south-eastern frontier line of Turkish Arabia. His Excellency put no question about what was happening east of that line, so I did not refer to El Qatar. He did enquire why the Ottoman Government had not ratified the 1913 convention, and on this point I was unable to enlighten him. I said, how ever, that as the 1914 convention confirmed the frontier in question, and, indeed, also prolonged it further southwards to the previously delimited frontier between the Aden Protectorate and the Vilayet of the Yemen, and as that convention had been ratified, the non-ratification of the earlier convention was hardly relevant to the matter in hand. 3. I handed to Mr. Skinner, for retention, the copy of the 1913 convention enclosed in your despatch, and lent him volume XI of Aitclfiesoris Treaties, a further copy of which he said he would purchase for the use of his Embassy. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's representatives at Washington and Jedda. I have, &amp;c. PERCY LORAINE. [81 t—1]4/ CONFIDENTIAL.

The Muzakis are sometimes changed, according to their popularity with the people or the reverse* In 1933 the ILead of the party was headed by Badr al , Utaibi, but as there were complaints of his harshness to the people, the Amir of Easa( r Abdullah bin Jilawi) sent in 1934 MUharmnad as-Sahali» 2. Zakah is charged at the rate of one dollar for each fall grown camel and half a dollar for each young camel. The Zakah should be paid in cash, but if a man cannot pay in cash the Mazakis take one of his best camels and assess its value at about one fifth of what it should be. The total yearly amount is between 10,000 and 15,000 dollars, depending on the season. In 1934 10,000 dollars were said to have been collected from the Manasir in Dhafrah(Juwa) • 3.

I asked if they had surveyed in that area and he said that the survey parties had not been down there. 2* I should judge that he did not know of the Blue Line or of the British Sphere, but I did not consider that I should mention them to him. 3.

Position however especially as regards activities of Hasa Oil concessionaires would not be safeguarded if ? Saudi refusal to accept Blue Line as frontier were left without formal answer. Note to Saudi Government on lines indicated in my telegram No.96 seems therefore essential. b. Unconditional Saudi recognition of Blue Line may not be obtained but proposed note should result either (1) in Saudi Government proposing discussion of possible modification of Blue Line frontier and thus recognising it tacitly if not explicitly as starting point of negotiations or (2) in further counter statement in latter case Saudi Government would have been made aware that His Majesty's Government would regard any activities of Saudi authorities or Hasa Oil concessionaires beyond Blue Line as violation of frontier while it would still be possible to avoid dis cussion at any rate until negotiations with Shaikh of Qatar are more advanced (see Bushire telegram No.602 to India Office). Second paragraph of your telegram. Relevant Phrases in Article 1 and Article VI of Treaty of 1916 with Ibn Saud both clearly implied that determination of boundary should be by agreement and therefore did not commit us/1 uS to abandon boundaries laid down in Anglo-Turkish Convention which consequently can only b^modified by agreement • Third paragraph. Argument based on analogy of Kuwait settlement can similarly be answered if necessary by pointing to fact that settlement was by agreement. It would however be best if possible to avoid ?giving this reply at present in view of desire of not emphasising possibility of modification by agreement. If you think it important to meet point you may include with proposed note statement to the effect that cases of Kuwait and Blue Line frontier are not in view of His Majesty's Government parallel since/developments in Arabia since 1914 appear to His Majesty's Government to render Blue Line frontier inappropriate • Paragraph 4. You will see that His Majesty s Government have no desire to expedite detailed discussions on this matter so long as their views are made clear and their right reserved nor do they wish at this stage to link question specifically to oil matter Position is to some extent safeguarded by fact that United States Govern ment have been informed of views of His Majesty s Government notwithstanding. - Secretary of State for foreign Affairs rXo. cjc iqV The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his com. pliraents to The Political Agent, Bahrain, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned docu- ment British Gonsulate-General, BUSHIRE. lllo Dated, 20th June 1934 Reference to previous correspoDdence: Political Resident 1 s Printed Letter No «C /281 of 16th June 1934 • Q /'W Description of Enclosure.

Saul, D.F.G., working in close touch with the Political Agent, BAHREIN, who accom panied the flying boat reconnaissance. 3, The reconnaissance was carried out on 9th May, 1934, and, in accordance with instructions from this Head- prters, the Wapitis flew from WHAT AL HUSSAIN via Port SAIYAN to DOHA and thence via KARASNA to SALWA. A report of this reconnaissance is attached as Appendix 'A', l The flying boats first reconnoitred DOHAT AS SALWA for a suitable alighting area and then crossed the peninsula from SAL1A to KHOR AL ODKID and reconnoitred the coast north to DOHA.

As regards flying boats the foot nf DOHAT AS SALWA near SALWA Wells is quite suitable for flying boats except when the 'ahamal' (north wind) is hlow- J, and in those circumstances flying hoats could take re- \m e in the southernmost bay of DJSZIRA HAWAH.

Subject:- REPORT ON RECONNAISSANCE OVER QATAR PENINSULA ON 9&gt;5.1954. A flight of four Wapitis left MUHARRAQ at 0205 hours G-.M.T, on 9th May, 1934, to make a reconnaissance of the southern central area of the QATAR PENINSULA. The reconnaissance commenced at the southern end of DOHAT-AL- HUSSAIN at 0244 hours G. M.T # Copies of photographs taken will 'be forwarded as soon as possible, a list of them is contained in Appendix 'A'. 2, An approximate course was steered for RAIYAN and DOHAH. One aircraft flew at 6,000 feet for the purpose of carrying out vertical photography. Conditions, however, proved unfavourable in most places dur to the presence of a mist haze laying at approximately 1,000 feet. The other three aircraft flew between 500 and 1,000 feet for purposes of observation and oblique photography. 3, The peninsula appeared from the air to be hard sand with hummocks, and plenty of camel-thorn and bushes round which sofe sand had formed mounds large enough to prevent a safe landing over almost the entire stretch of country. The whole area is covered with dried water holes and there are several patches green with grass and trees, 'so that water appears to be near the surface in very many places. 4, A small encampment was passed, about three miles south-east of DOHAT-AL-HUSSAIN. Another camp of several tents was seen a further three miles on this course. Course was then altered to approximately north-east to regain the original track. 5, On reaching GHAPAT eight tents, including one white one, were observed. The three low flying pilots were of the opinion that GHAPAT was approximately seven miles south sast of it's position as shown on the sketch map. 6, One mile to the north of GHAFAT were sixteen to twenty tents and a car (a van). There were apparently no wells to the immediate vicinity of this camp. A few miles to the west a well—marked car track was first seen, which ran from ®APAT to RAIYAN and DOHAH. ^ a large well, mined buildings, grass and trees seen at WAJAIBAH, about three miles west of RAIYAN. photographs were taken of this and also a piece of apparently uat ground slightly north# The latter was considered fit for inverting into a landing ground.8&lt; RAIYAN has plenty of water, and the Sheikh's summer residence has beautiful and well-kept gardens, water being pumped up by a wind-driven pump. a stretch of ground about a mile east of RAIYAN on the DOHAH track (slightly green with grass) was considered fit for landing on, as far as could be ascertained from the air. The ground was searched in the immediate vicinity of DOHAH, but no fi't foi* landing on was noted. Vertical and oblique photographs were taken of RAIYAN and DOHAH, also the track connecting them. 9* Course was then set from RAIYAN to KARA'ANA. On the north-eastern half of this track several water—holes were observed, but none on the south-western half. 10. At KARA'ANA a good well was seen, with a few buildings nearby. Immediately south of these the area, it was considered, would form a good landing ground provided labout was employed to clear camel-thorn and small bushes. Another area also considered as a probable landing ground was observed one mile south-west of KARA 1 ANA. 11. At SAB-SAB, approximately 2 miles south-east of KARA f ANA, an area of greenery, containing a fairly large well, was observed to have sunk considerably. 12. From KARA f ANA the course to SAL¥A was over an arid and rocky area, on which it would be extremely difficult to execute a successful forced landing. At SALWA, south of the coast, were scattered groups of trees, beyond which were extensive mud-flats. These appeared to be suitable to land on. No ruined fort or deserted buildings, or signs of occupation, as noted on the sketch map, were seen hereabouts. 13 # Prom SALWA the aeroplanes returned to MUHARRAQ. 14. The reconnaissance lasted 4 hours 20 minutes. (Sgd) S.P. VINCENT. Squadron Leader,Commanding, No.84 (Bomber) Squadron, Royal Air Force. Shaibah.—/2. Appendi x 'B'. rtt&gt; t-o^ Cf^] 5^-.

The inlet near JAZIRAT 2AKHUNIYAE Is approximately 10 miles in length and a mile wide, running north and south. It is completely sheltered from all winds and would make a good anchorage for Plying Boats. See photographs Nos. 1 and 2. The coast line between JAZIRAT ZAKHUNIYAH and DUHAT HAMAR is riat and sandy with shoals and reef*s some two to three hundred yards out to sea lying parallel to the coast. BUHAT HAMAR is an inlet approximately 1,000 yards long hy 400 yards wide. It is sheltered on all sides, but has extensive shoals which limit the area for the operation of Flying Boats. It is not considered that a Plying Boat would be able to taxi from DUHAT HAMAR into DUHAT-AS-SALWA to take oft owing to the mouth of the inlet being extremely shallow and obstructed by sand banks. See photographs No. 3 and 4. Between DUHAT HAMAR and SALWA there are three definite bays onf which only one is shown on the chart. None of these were suitable for Plying Boat anchorages. At SALWA there is a small inlet approximately 800 yards by 300 yards which is snallow and full of sand banks and is definitely unsuitable for Plying Boat use. I I it Ml n ! (b) Eastern Coast . On 9.5.34. 3.1435 carried out a reconnaissance of the eastern coast of DUHAT-AS-SALWA from KHOR PAISHSHAKH to SALWA Wells. The coast which appeared to differ considerably from the chart was sketched and is shown on the attached tracing. No suitable alighting areas were observed in the vicinity of DUHAT PAISHSHAKH, the water being extremely shallow with a large number of coral reefs. The southern most bay of HAWAR ISLAND would possibly afford good shelter in emergency, though difficulty would be experienced in taking off or in taxying to a suitable position for taking off owing to the shallow water, reefs, etc. See photographs Nos. 5 and 6. At the foot of DUHAT - AS - SALWA, near SALWA Wells, there is ample area of deep water, free from shoals and reefs Flying Boats to operate on. The bottom is sandy with a patches of coral, the rise and fall of tide is said to ^ about three feet. Two anchorages, used by native boats d ^ing a Shamal, were visited but were considered unsuitable f( tt Hying Boat use. nil■iH 2. fiAT.WA WELLS TO HOB-AL- 1 ODAIt) . One area approximately four miles south of fells was observed and it seemed large and flat enouth for a landing ground, though the ground appeared to be salty. No Bedu encampments were seen, though 30 - 40 camels were seen in a position 095° SALWA 12. a few camels were also seen grazing about 4 miles N.N.W. of KHOR -AL-'OTAID. For the first fifteen miles from SALWA Wells to HOR -ODAID is of an undulating nature, partially rock and partially sand. Tne remaining distance to HOR-aL -'ODAID the country is covered with sand hills some 50 feet hicch ana one or two large areas of 'Subkha' were noticed near' HOR -AL-'ODAID. 5. HOR -AL-'ODAID . Both Plying Boats alighted in HOR-AL-'ODAID which appears to be a suitable Plying Boat alighting area and anchorage. It is approximately 2^ miles north by south and a mile and a half east by west, sheltered from all winds and has a mud bottom. See photographs Nos. 7,8,9 and 10. Soundings were taKen at the HOR end of the channel connecting the HOH to the sea. The western portion of this channel is about 6 feet deep in the centre, increasing in depth towards the seaward end. The rise and fall of tide does not appear to be more than three feet. There is a shallow bar in the channel at the place marked 'X' on the attached map. See photographs Nos. 11 and 12. 4. HOR-AL-'ODAID TO DOHAH . The coast line varies slightly to that indicated on the chart as is shown in attached tracing. The coast from HOR-AL-'ODAID to about 2 miles south of WAKRAH is low lying and salty with sand dunes a short distance inland. Prom 2 miles south of WAKRAH to DOHAH the coast changes from dunes and 'Subkha' to undulating country 'ith hard rocky soil. No suitable areas for landing grounds were observed. No Bedu encampments were seen.15': Alii xiiLaDQJJ Att'MHb , Bill Hi Si± j? : OiiCKb IB 1 IHAQ,, nm^Lljl f ^ XiiiiQ,# ^/S.38/34. 14th June, 1934 jjy dear Fowls , I iiave received your personal I).0, letter dated 30th aay, 1934.

'Bie Britisii vernment are ofiering a guarantee of protection to the Sheikh of Qatar, and presumably must be prepared to carry out this guarantee if required. The only way that there is any livelihood of the guarantee being enforced is by the use of aircraft, and to do this we must have suitable landing grounds and intelligence. Although it is possible to select what appears to be a suitable site for a landing ground from the air, it is not possible to maKe a final decision until the area has been examined on tne ground. | If an Intelligence Officer had accompanied tne i.P.0.0. party, he could have inspected suibat)_u conspicuously, and we should have been in a better position to say whether or not our guarantee of protection would large or small commitment.

They enclose statement of reasons for strong attitude. ffollowing are main points in enclosed statement• 1. Blue line was not agreed upon between Governments having proper authority and locus standi. Saudi Government do not now wiBh to discuss position of His Majesty's Government at that time but Turkish Government clearly had no right to determine destiny of countries which had made agreements with His Majesty's Government. Authority of Ottoman Government never extended beyond inhabited towns and/and villages and ceased when ibn Saud recovered his ancestral territories and established his legal authority therein by occupying Haaa on April 13th 1913. Any agreements made regarding them ?with Turkish Government after that date are void* . 2* Article I of Treaty of December 16th 1915 between His M^j esty^ ^overnraent and Ibn Saud shows that concise frontier was not determined but was to be fixed subsequently and that His Majesty's Government recognised right of tbn Saud to dominions of his ancestors and tribes belonging ^hereto# By their agreement to protocol on lejd-Kuwait frontier they recognised inappropriateness of Anglo-Turkish Line as a true and acceptable basis for frontier between Ibn Saud^ dominions and other neighbouring countties# 3 # Limits of Qatar are known amongst Arab tribes to be those inhabited towns and villages at which Ibn Saud •s dominions are known to and actual limit between his dominions and Qatar is that of Haj rat (i.e. . stony di strict as opposed to sandy desert beyond) of Qatar. Saudi Government cannot contemplate alteration of traditional frontier or of acti^, frontier except by straightforward agreement, for which they are prepared* 4 # All tribes between coastal towns I of fetar and coast of Oman and Hadhranat belong to Saudi Arabia. They obey its laws pay zakat and obey calls to war etcetera. This situatio# of fact and exercise of Saudi authority are never cha_llenged by coastal rulers. Saudi Government have in agreeme nj; and still consider them as part of His Majesty's ri^ts to which there can be no opposition. Comments and record of conversation with IMd will follow.

Tone of Saudi communication is polite but very firm. In view od importance of precise lan- -guage used and your desire not to go too fast I told fuad yesterday that Hismadeaty f s Government were unlikely to form their opinion of communication until they had seen its concise terms and that while unable to discuss merits of question I wished to elucidate certain points. 2. I feared that use of plural 11 Governments ,, in note implied agreement should be mth local rulers. Ifaad assured me that intention was merely to state general principle applying to any frontier agreeraent between Saudi Gove r rim en t and any other Government whatsoever. ab 1 drafted my telegram under reference adter my conversation with i'uad i think it unnecessary to tslegrajh regarding other points elucidated thereby. I will report fully by despatch by next ba^. 4. notwithstanding limits which I set to conversation we naturally touched main issue at various Points. ]?uad referred more than once to Karawer as though he considered...a. aonsidercd it an imp^tant point and tn Ildiwal^ settlements east of Blue i^ine. I was careful nor to suggs st any probable weakening by His Maj esty's Government in their views of legal position. I purposely let fall words ^British sphere^ at intervals in order to oonteract any idea that matter waw merely one of frontiers between Saudi Arabia and Shaikh of -^atar etc., 5 # jtoad attempted especially in later stages of conversation to be^little whole question as relating to a few miles^of desert 11 ^ I pointed out that area between Anglos-Turkish line ard limits a± claimed in his note was enormous. He thereupon took annex C to Anglo?Turkish Convention Of 1914 and auggested possibility of line due south from Karawer ( which he seemed to think was on base line of ^tar peninsular) and north eastern end of Hadravteaut bending across to same western terminal as violet line. jfuad complained that ^is majesty s Government had given ibn Saud no indication in 1916 that they regarded Blue Line as operative and main- -tained that language of treaty of that year justi- -fled King's present pretensions. I suggested that areas left for future determinition might well have been conceived as not in any case extending beyond Anglo-Turkish lines. I referred to possible effect of Treajty of Jedda without however developing my argument in detail. I ' would have been roughly that treaty stabilised Saud's ^ole positxon vxs ^ Ti s -is Majesty's Government including his posxtxon . j'uad complained as ruler of succession state). that. • •tHat I 9 ! 7 iiia ^esty's Government had again n0 interest on present contention although poaitioa as regards looal rulers in Eastern Arabia had been fully discussed, 7 • Confidential# x got general iiapresaioii that ibn Baud is much interested in ^atar but cares little about trucial Shaikhdoras. yuad 1 s suggestion in paragraph 5 above may afford indication that what is in king's mind is to main- -tain connection with ^atar; to retain Ikhwan settlements ; perhaps to be able to meet Americans as regards boundary of Hasa Concession; and to placate His Majesty's Government by agreeing to line well inland from Trucial Coast and clearly north of n adra/maut knowing he can still exercise tribal influence beyond it# At the same time FuadBsuggestion mad® in more personal portion of a c onver sat ion, from which I expressly excluded formal discussion of main issue, cannot be regarded as a proposal by Saudi Gov- -ernment* l?or one thing it is increasingly un- -certain whether Fuad commands the full confidence of the King.

These I think dispose of any 'ancestral' claims by Ibn Saud to any part of the territories in &lt;|aestion, at all events to the three last named. His occupational claims to Hasa are not in dispute# 2. 'ftie submission of vague ancestral claims is a favourite device of Arab Rulers, and I recollect that the Iman of Yemen, when I was at Aden, based his claim to the Aden Protectorate partly on ancestral grounds, which on examination proved to be entirely fictitious. Sometimes the chaotic and tribal conditions of Arabia make it difficult to refute such pretentions, but in the present case the task has been comparatively simple. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Sir 3. HASA . Table A It will be seen from the Table that prior to/to Itm Saud ! s occupation of Hasa in 1913, the Wahabis liad only occupied that province for two comparatively short periods,i*e. 23 years, from. 1796 to 1818, and 8 years, from 1830 to 1838. This hardly comprises an ancestral claim, and Hasa is no more naturally WahaM because they have occupied it for the last 20 years than Riyadh and Central Kejd can he said to he naturally Shammar because the latter -^lield it from 1888 to 1902. The ancestral home of the (C^ Vvahabis is of course Central Hejds where they hold sway elsewhere in Arabia it is merely by virtue of their very recent conquests. However the point is of an academical nature. 4. QATAR * Table b. Ibn Baud has certainly no claims on Qatar. The Wahabis only occupied it, more than a century ago, ^.or two years, i .e. from 1809 to 1811. On occupational grounds the Turks, who occupied it from 1871 to 1914, would have the strongest claim, but their claim was never recognised by His Majesty 1 s Government, and in 1914 was renounced. St TrtUC-Uju CUAoi' . xable C. More than a century ago from 1800 to 1820 tfahatoi influence was strong in this area, tout they have never been in occupation of on any point on theeoast, or in the Interior with the exception of Baraimi, from which the Trucial Coast Shaikhs have made various efforts to eject them. Such influence as they exercised has been retrograde and their allies at one period were the notorious Qawasimi pirates. As British influence increased WahaM influence waned, and at present any direct influence whixn they have left is confined to Baraimi, though the Trucial Coast/Coast Shaikhs may from time to time pay Xbn Saud some sort of 'tribute' in order to prevent the latter inciting his tribes to raid their hinterland territories. 6. OMAN . Table D. At various times in the past &lt;the last occasion being in 1865) the Wahabis, with Baraimi as their centrej have ravaged the Sultanate with fire and sword, a^ exacted tribute from more than one Sultana No place in Oman, however, (with the exception of Baraimi), has been in occupation of the .fahabis and no tribute has been forth 1 - coming from Muscat for many years. 7. Tribute. In the course of this letter and in the attached Tables mention has been made of 'tribute 1 (zakat) paid to the Wahabis. There are two sorts of tribute which are paid to Ibn Saud. There is (a) that which is paid by the inhabitants of an area under Wahabi occupation, which is of the Same nature as taxes paid to any government, and which is a recognition of Wahabi rule. (b) There is also the 'tribute' which is exacted by Ibn Saud from Shaikhs outside his kingdom under threat of raids or other unpleasantness. This of course is the modern blackmail, or the ancient Danegeld, and is in no way a sign of submission to rfahabi rule. Such tribute as is exacted by Ibn Saud in the territories Kast of the Blue Line is Danegeld, pure and simple.
