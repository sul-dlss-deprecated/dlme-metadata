This Bureau, which has been in operation for over a year now, receives reports from the great majority of ports, situated throughout the whole of the Eastern territory and disseminates them by weekly telegrams in code, which is broadcasted from Saigon each Friday at 01.30 GMT on a wave length of 20,800 metres. With regard to Persian Gulf ports, we already get returns from Basrah, , and hope almost immediately to get returns also from Mohamerah, Bushire and Bunder Abbas* To make the picture of that part of the world complete, I am approaching you for your help and also the Government of Groan with regard to returns from the port of Muscat. What we wish from you is a weekly telegram dealing with a period ending on Saturday midnight, which should be cabled not later than the following Wednesday morning and should contain in formation with regard to incidents of plague, cholera and smallpox in your port.
