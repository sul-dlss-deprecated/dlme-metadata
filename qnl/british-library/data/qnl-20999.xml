Ibn Sa'ud^ messengers referred to above passed by Jaryah where news had Just arrived of a fight between the *AJman and Fahd bin Jlluwi at Rudainfyah, seven miles south, south west of Sarar, which resulted In the death of Doth Fahd and Dhaidan al-Hithlain. According to a man who was present in battle and is well Known here, Dhaidan first visited Fahd and was received with honour and dismissed with suitable presents. Fahd then summoned him again and arrested him on his arrival. Dhaidin protested and said that the 'AJmAn would never tolerate his arrest and would certainly attack Fahd if he did not release him stSStSL but Fahd replied that if they did he would have him executed at once. Naif al-Hithlain Abul Kilab who was with Fahd sent word to the tribe of what had happened to Dhaidan and the 'AJman attacked Fahd's camp that night. Fahd kept his word and had Dhaidan killed j^sasok.but was killed himself almost immediately afterwards. The Hasa force was completely routed and over 1000 are said to have been killed. The Murrah have Joined the ’AJman who are talking of marching on Hasa, but it is thought unlikely that they will. There was great excitement over news in Jaryah.

Dated 9th (received iOtii ) June 19 29. 1 think we are bound to meet I bn Sand’s request either by allowing Ibn Baud to pursue over the frontier or by keeping Haehhur and rebellious AJtmn out of Kuwait. As ihey will surely be a source of trouble in future as were refugees of the liutair and t'haim&amp;r in the past, it is also in our interest that 3dm they should not be allowed refuge. Presumably the Huler of Kuwait is unable to hold his frontier by force unless asuisted by us, and it is also doubtful whether we could now prevent further leakage of supplies, which he has been furnishing during past few months to rebel Akhwan. Question is whether we should leave Hul^ r to allow the King’s forces to pursue into Kuwait or hold hia (Puler*u ) frontier for him. This raises the whole question of extending our commitments in regard to Kuwait. Bituation has been discussed by me with the Air Officer Commanding: we see considerable difficulty in adequately protecting Iraq as well as frontier with forces at our disposal and at present tine of year. We should be akwardly placed vis a vis bin i aud if we fail to discharge the responsibility undertaken by ua in full raeaBure. On the whole it appears that Lhc best course is to agree to bin ruud’s pursuing across Kuwait border if the ^uler o£ Kuwiiit is unable to keep out rebel tribesmen and to undertake only to prevent them from enters ing Iraq. It obviously undosArable to agree to win, u 1 V-outtd'u forcea entering Iraq proper, but it night be permitted to both parties to pureue into neutral zone, which ia XiJcely pJtace for refugees; thia would con siderably lighten task of K.A.i?. but would require the be urged and auaieted alno to form a force for the although control of any xxxipdctt leakage of eupplien from Kuwait ia first eecential. One of hi* liajeaty^o hhipe at Kuwait would give feeling of eecurlty at preeent juncture and, of course, help from the Air yorce at Sliaibeh would be quickly available in the event of serious menace to the town of Kuwait. T!ntry of rebel tribennen into her territory will be prevented by the Covernratant of Iraq by all available measures, but His hajesty ahouifc be xx warned of difficulty of distinguishing them from Hio own forces and consequent necessity of latter not crossing the frontier of Iraq.

Copy of letter No. S.O. 1031, dated the 13th May 1929, from the Political Secretary to Hie Kxcellency the High Commissioner for ’Iraq, Baghdad, to the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to acknowledge xioc receipt of your letter No. 144-S., dated the 1st of May 1929, enclosing a copy of letter No. 2bO-S., dated the 29th of March 1929, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, which had in advertently been omitted from your letter No. 103-B., dated the 8th of April 1929. 2. Before discussing the question of the attitude of the Shaikh of Kuwait in regard to the Akhwan, His Excellency the Acting High Coiamissloner desired me to refer to the remark made in the secona paragraph of your letter dated /he 8th of April 1929, to the effect that the Political Resident would have appreciated being asked for his own views instead of those of one of his sub ordinate officers. Sir Gilbert Clayton had naturally no intention jjt at any time of asking for the views of a subordinate officer upon any question of principle or policy, and he fears that my letter no. 8.0. 673, dated the 21st ttf March 1989, may hatre been misunderstood. The position was this. His Kxcellency had received from Captain Glubb a report which indicated that the Thaikh of Kuwait’s attitude in respect of the Najd am Iraq tribes respectively was, to say the least of it, unsatisfactory. It appeared to him that if this report y/as accurate, it would be necessary to consider measures with a view to inducing the Shaikh of Kuwait .o alter his attitude. But before putting forward any suggestions or recommenda tions for ^he consideration of His Majesty’s Government ^subject, of course, to consultation vith he Political Resident; he wished to ascertain how far Captain Gikubb’s account2 account of the state of affairs was correct. he, therefore, asked that he night be furnished with the opinion of the .Political Agent at Jiuwait, not as to the policy which should be pursued in the matter, but merely as to whether the Shaikh of Kuwait could give a satis- factory answer to the accusations levelled at him by Captain Glubb. It appeared obvious that the Political Resident would accept the views of the Political Agent at .Kuwait on this matter and it did not, and still does not, appear to His Excellenc. that he t/as taking an unusual course in requesting that, in view of the comparative urgency of the matter, the Political Agent should be authorised to repeat his opinion tu him direct. He regrets that this request of his should have given offence, but tesire^ me to point out that had it been found possible to comply with it, he would have received Colonel More 1 s interesting and valuable letter of the 29th March early in April, instead of only on the 8th May. 3. His Excellency, when forwarding Captain Glubb f s report, realised that Ca, tain Glubb’s information cane from biased sources, and for that very reason was anxious to submit it to the criticism of the Political Resident and the Political Officer, Kuwait. lie would, in fact, have preferred not to have forwarded the report in original, but to have sent .he gist of it to the Political Resident couched in more moderate language. The report war, however, received in lus Secretariat on mail day and as the question was urgent, it was forwarded in original as received. 4* Sir Gilbert Clayton has reau with interest Colonel More *s letter of the 29th March which sets forth the Shaikh’s position very clearly. At the same time it does not offer a very satisfactory explanation of Ibn Subah’s attitude in regard to the raid on the U; ni Malik. On the 1st of March, Colonel More telegraphed asking foran escort to enable the Bani Malik to rejoin the 'Iraq/ tribes in northern Kuwait territory and stating that, pending a reply, he had asked the Shaikh xx t - ^ remain at Kuwait and to_ make the beslt poasibije arrange - ments for their protection , In view oi this requeot, His Excellency assumed that the Buni Malik would be safe from attack for a short time. It appears, however, both from Captain Glubb’s report ana from Colonel More’s own account of he incident, that the Shaikh made no serious effort to protect the Bani Malik, who were massacred within a few yearx yards of the wa^ls of Kuwait without any attempt being made to renaer them assistance. ihe Bani Malik raid, is, however, a JiinJq of the past and recriminations levelled at the Shaikh of Kuwait are unlikely to lead to any useful result. The point that His Excellency wished to consider was, how far the policy which the Shaikh of Kuwait had adopted to his own interests was inimical to the interests, in Iraq, of His Majesty’s Government, and whether it was necessary to take steps 10 induce him to alter that policy. 5 # The whole situation has now been changea by the defeat of the Akhwan by Ibn Saud and by the fact that the Shaikh of Kuwait appears to be taking steps to adopt vhe pdlicy suggested in the Political Kesiaent’s telegram of March 26th and to prevent recalcitrant Hajd tribes from taking as^ldm in Kuwait territoi?y. whether ^he Shaikh of Kuwait is to be pressed, and perhaps assisted by His Majesty’s Government, to adopt a firmer line in his dealings with the Akhwan appears to depend entirely the upon^measure of success which attends the ex^oits, which he is now reported to be making, to *.eep them •ut of Kuwait territory. The report tnat Ibn Mashhur, while irepossession of a iafcge amount of loot ta-tcen Irom Iraq and flajd tribes, was allowed not only to* encamp in Kuwait territory but actually to occupy the famous i'Hxxxml fort- 4 - fort at Jahrah, is disquieting and it appears not improbable that the f-haikh’s efforts to prevent the Ajman from encamping in his territory will be unsuccessful. Should Ibn Mashhur and the Ajman remain in Kuwait territory in spite of the reported efforts of ibn Subah to dislodge them,,it appears probable that further steps will have to be taken, ana it is not unlikely that a request for action of some sort may be received from Ibn Haud himself. 6.

Repelling of raiders. Copies to .Foreign Office, Baghdad and Kuwait.Translation. Ho. 31/2/4. 9-1-1348 (16-6-1929;. His Excellency His Britannic Majesty’s Agent and Consul, Jedda. I have already explained in several notes sent by me on different dates to Mr Jenkins the present situa tion on the frontiers of Hejd, hut^ait and Iraq. His Majesty the King has also written on the sane sub„eets in letter Ho. 31/3/183 of 20-12-1347 (29-5-29). Hince then the Hejaz Government have been awaiting the reply of the British Government approving of the measures which His Maj« esty has suggested. Meanwhile, however, a great change has taken place in the situation, necessitating the hasten' ing of the request thata definite decision should be maie mxx on/ the subject. It has come to the knowledge of the Hejaz Gov ernment that Faisal ed Doweish who was severely beaten by the forces of His Majesty a short tine ago for embark ing on his well-known activities against Iraq and Kuwait, * fled from hi® town a. few days ago to &amp; 0 U 1 the AJman and Ibn Mashur. In this connection i think it necessary to explain the reasons for his fleeing and state as follows: necessary punitive measures at Sabla, His Majesty issued orders to the effect that the whole of the looted pro perty plundered by Ed Doweish and his followers from Iraq and Iraq tribes be collected for restitution to its various pretexts, but His Majesty’s determination not to show any indulgence forced him to believe that he had no alternative but to pay. It happened that the man in question received certain assistance and encouragement intended to urge and induce him to commit actions which wtrc When His Majesty’s forces proceeded to the owners. Ed Doweish attempted to t out of this on would2 would again trouble the happy state of relations. ihen carae the fact of his running away. You doubtless know that His Majesty the King chastised Ed Doweish and his party solely as a punishnent for the activities they were guilty of against the Iraq tribes, because, in fact, no crime can be laid to the charge of the people in question in hejd, ana the action for which the Hejd Government blame them is that of com mitting hostile acts against subjects of a neighbouring country. I have already written about the positive in tention of His Majesty to inflict punishment on El Ajman and Ibn Mashur, and there is no doubt he will do the same to Ed Eoweish also. As I have already informed Your Excellency, His Majesty my Lord the King has taken this action against those people solely because they had attacked Kuwait and Iraq. So if Kuwait continues helping them as I have already informed you, and if jchey receive necessary en- eouraggment on the part of certain other authorities, in spite of the fact that the Hejaz Government are fighting them for the sake of Kuwait and Iraq, then the situation cannot be straightened out in such a manner. Therefore 4f the British Government are really desirous that peace and quietness should prevail on the frontiers the Hejaz Government would like to see from them real and effective help in this matter, in order that they may rest assured of the practical results of His Majesty’s disciplinary efforts. This will come about by taking the following measures: (1) The British Government should entirely prevent these criminals communicating withKuwait and with cities in Iraq, and prevent their being joined by anyone, whoever he may be, from Kuwait and Iraq. (2) If people in Hejd see no effective measures taken by the British Government against these people, they will be filled with misgivings as to its intention^ and will be led3 - led to believe that these criminals' movements are govern ed by its wishes. In order to remove such misgivings and • Kuwait and Iraq, the Hejaz Government see no objection to agreeing to British aeroplanes going and beating the criminals, wven in the case of their being found within the frontiers of Uejd, provided that this should take place on this occasion only, (3) 'The Hejaz Govertiment are afraid that when the Hejdi forces are pursuing the criminals the latter may flee in- dide the frontiers of Kuwait and Iraq, and it is therefore necessarfy-that some agreement should be arrived at with the British Government xtautib* with a view to allowing the nejdi forces to come up with them and pursue them within the frontiers of Kuwait and Iraq until sevene punishment is inflicted on them. (4) I beg that you will peruse the letter which Feisal ed Doweish sent to His ^cyal Highness Amir Saud, His Majesty’s son, on the subject of his flight, but on reading it, it will oe clear to you that the position oalls for resolution 4 and active assistance from the British Goverjjment, it is intended to strengthen the supports of peace and tranquility. I earnestly hope that the British Goverjanent will take the most speedy measures in reply to the request of His Majesty the King, and will thUs furnish a real and satisfactory proof of the co-operation expected from a friendly Govem- to cuty off £he criminals’ hope of taking refuge in ment. With the highest respect and greetings. FAHD Acting Minister for foreign Affairs.'l.. ^mfl ■ '*m' ' * i &gt;' Translation (?) In the name of God the Most Merciful the Compassionate. From Faisal 'bin Sultan Ed Doweish to the respected brother Amir Said bin Imam AM el Aziz ibn Abder Kahraan A1 Faisal, may God save him. JPAace, Mercy and the Bless ing of God be upon you always. Your letter has been received and its contents noted. As for your advice to me to submit to the orders of your father the Imam, you will realise that my greatest desire is to comply with your orders especially after your father’s kindness to me after the battle of Sabla. By God, I bjjl willing to sacrifice my wealth and property for his satisfaction except for two reasons which make this difficult for me and beyond my ppwer: firfct, my being compelled to bring back the missing property and the second, something more difficult (a) we have raided only infidels and breakers of promises who build forts and encourage your subjects to rebel against you. I have informed your father of this and this is the reproach of the Akhwan against your father. Otherwise, all your actions when dealing with us are agreekfcle, may God reward you. (b) The missing property is gone and I have nothing of it left in my possession. It has occurred to me, and other people, have convinced me, that your order is only a device to entangle me and that you will either kill me or imprisdn me. Baud, I have left my desert, and my Shaikh- ship, and sacrificed my wealth in seeking the gifts of God and fighting the infidels. If you wish to prevent us from fighting them, and if when one of us commits an in fraction you will either imprison or kill him, this is a calamity and oppression of your subjects, who may desert you, doubt your belief and irrevocably decide that you are hindering them in their religion, and indulging Unit ofFaisal have not failed to do what they can. Anyone who goes over to them from the Hejd peo ple is encouraged and favoured, and told to disobey Saud and that he will be given so and so. Since last year Abu Naneik has been advising me and others and I have informed you accordingly. The ready proof is that you know Ibn Sahah is not worth a hen to the Christians or the Arabs. He has given Ibn Mashur arms, aimunition and money, and has communicated with the Ajman and told them that whatever they want is obtainable from him, and has promised to grant their requests. He has also told them to go to Wafra and he will keep Saud from them and that in case Saud should come after them his territories are free for them to enter, and that he will speak to the Christians on their behalf. You must understand that if the Christians were not only deceiving you and not only intending to deduce your subjects so that they may overpower you, the man of Kuwait would not have disagreed with them, it is because he is 4nder them that in these days I receive notices from Iraq and Kuwait asking me specious promises if I leave you. You have also prevented me from raiding the Bedouins. So we are neither Moslems fighting the unbelievers nor are we Arabs and Bedouins raiding each otT other and living on what we get from each other. You have kept us away from both our religions and our worldly concerns. It is true that you have not failed to do what you can -j^or me and my people but where are the rest of my tribes to go ? They will perish and how can we be contented with this ? In the past you used to forgive any of us who eommitted a sin, but now you treat us with the sword and pass over the Christians, their religion and the forts built for your immediate des truction, Saud. So I have become frightened and have left ArtawiaArtawia for Lasafa If you want us as your subjects you should look into your case. We want from you three things, which we wish your father to promise us if the Shaikhs approve, and which you, A1 Saud, should under take : firstly, to wipe out the past, sedondly, to release your prisoners and each of us fear his part will guarantee to do the same, and thirdly, to be allowed to fight the in fidels, with one of you, sons of Abd el Aziz, accompanying us. We will do other work for you, we the people of Nejd. If we are killed, it does not matter, just as our brethren the Ghut Ghut took the liejaz and it became yours in your name. If you agree to &amp;ui]uqQ these points I promise to be your servant and slave and to allow you a free hand over our lives and property. Our brethren the prisoners will promise you the same. Your people of Nejd, do not be deceived by those near you. As regards the bedouins, if jrhey see your treatment of us, and see how the infidels receive those who go from you to them, by God, none will remain. You know that the begt of them as regards religion, and the nearest to you are those whom you have killed and imprisioned. So if you want us, let some well-known learned man come to us and release the prisoners at Riyadh and I swear by God in this meet ing held by the Ajman, Mutair and others that we will attack the infidefts before we go to you or as God may guide you. 1 am still hopeful and I know how your father loves his subjects and likes to fofgive them. He is the politician of us Arabs. So give us a special guarantee securing ^he aafety of the Ajman and Ibn Mashur and those who are with him, and forgiving their past. We ask you by God not to send us away disappoint* ed or deprived of your friendship and of the religion of Islam' ~ - - 4 - Islam, and compelled to go th the Christians whom we dislike and who dislike us. If you agree, by Godiji you may test us in any thing you will and see what we will do. If a second incident occurs, you may do whatever you like. By God, we have left all the old folk weeping, the Women weeping and we are weeping. tSaud, my brother, do not give up jcbx your friend for your enemy. Please send the reply quickly before anything hapi^ens and note one thing namely the enemy of your religion does not help you. Abd el Aziz sends his compliments. Please convey my compliments to the Shaikhs and the sons, (Sealed) Faisal ed Boweish. 28-12-1347 (6-6-29)Bush ire, 14 th July 1929. y Telegram P. From Political Agent, Kuwait.

After my arrival in Riyaz I gave orders for mobilisation on the 1st Rabi Awrfal but ail the people of Nejd refused to move and replied that I hacL not listened to their advice and that their complaints against Ad- BAWISH and the AJMAN, BAUI-ABDULLAH and ATAIBAH who had disturbed the peace of Hejd had not been heeded, with the result that Ad-DAWISH and aJMaH had plundered property and shed blood of the Muslims, and the others, too, were watch- -ing rtf opportunity to do the worst in Nejd; the people are becoming more and more inclined to listen to the false- -hooie spread by the rebels and that they would not go out to fight unless I gave them permission to do what they like each tribe to choose its own enemy and exterpate it, I admitted that they were justified in their grievances, but refusedrefused to allow them their own way. Most of the Nejd people became refractory anu would not obey my orders, but I negotiated witn them and also pramiBed to pleace them in their own way ana then they pledged themselves to me. x then gave orders to the HhHB to march to and encamp in DUWAlHZRrdI and the ATaIBAK to go and encamp in 1 ARJA and DWADIHI and the Q/diTiiN to join ub in f iuAKl«. After letters had gone and people were preparing to march to those places, God ordained otherwise and His will is the best: Ad-ItAWiaH attacked Al-^A , IYAll and then became like Cat4n, misguiding people especially those oi the •ATAIBAH and UDTAIR round him, by sending to them FAISaL bin HUHAIB and AI-IOLlDIIHI and some others who are with (friends of ) the Sharif ( FEISaL ? ) with the message that he ( FBI SAL ad-DANISH ) had moved and done what he had done only for the good of Hejd and Bejdis U * iu emissaries of the Sharif ueclar^d that the Siiarif and the English hM narchea to HASX imd anu h^d tal:en both, while the other Sharif ( aBDULLAH ? ) haa tedeen IUIDJAL. When these eniBsarios went out they pretended that they were hostile to 301 i^ Ad-Lawiah whom they denounced as an apostate, so that Kejdia might be deceived. Some of tlie ^1-HAJAH were misguided and raided some camels of Ad-LAHIMhH and (^AHTAB and their Satanic propanganda way spread everywhere so that the notorioue Ibn JABRIH and Ibn C^aTIM and Xbn f ASAl began to plunder and did not spare even their neighbours ana gueuts. Then these misguided men asaembled at ^ADHxKH and also ibn RABIA1I and the aTaIBAH arrived at ’ARsA true to their promise to ua. He ( Ad-DAWISH ) marched up to them and encamped with C near } then for 1 tr days. Then the prople of DAKHHAH made a yurprise attack upon them, supported by some people of DAHIHaH. Goa gave victory and the enemy was killed and their property taken, the remnanta(zo © r^zananto being purouod tixi the following afternoon. When Ibn Habiun retired and camped at Hitfrl, our port waa coning from kecca by motor care and the last remnants of Ad-hUHAlNAH ana the other supporters of Ibn QATIM attempted to waylay them. One car was immediately sent off to Ibn Rabian and his men who were around and they arrived at JaBLaH. They _ound DUH&amp;IHAH tind the r . „ rebels in UAWaJAH and engaged them. ALI ad-hUHAUf/dl with 700 men were hilled. The remaining IKHWAll with Ad- r PUHAIHaH attempted to water at MAWAJAH wells but were pursued anu nearly surroimded, so that he fled leaving his wounded followers mostly natives of GHATGHAT. As regards BaNI BaLIK arid BHUWAIBI # they began to move on the left and gathered other ill-dinx)osed scoundrels ana all of them proceeded to^ SHa’aBa waters where they were joined by the IKUWaU of tire IIaI 3 under 6 flags. They raided in parties of two flags each and loot- -ed all whom they came upon, taking camels and sheep killing all the men. Then they encamped at HaSKaH and were attacked by XKHWAV l liin Gaud’s ) whom God gave victory over them. Later their remnants gathered together at TaLAL where WALiiD with some of the HARB have followed them up under six flags and so far we have not received their news• i HAILHaL and Ibn JA’AIIIa and Ibn RaZIH surprised / at AHlYAH a force of Ibn *aMI and HAyA’AH and Ma^TAH and HOG AH who had stolen some camels of my oon BAUD’S dependents. They were surrounded and killed and everything captured. On receiving this news we sent KHALID bin MUHAkHAD and CialiTAH and ordered IBP Ki^lAh with all flagu of BIHUU* KOGa and some natives of DAKHHAH to procetid to iiN-HIR anu they will be met by KHALID bln MTBiAMUAD’s force from south, tfhile EHaLID bin UJWAI with Un people of tflDTAK will join from FARAD and then^ 4 ujl then thereto what Ood ordains.

We have already ordered the HADIIAh to march in a strong force and they are going down ( south )• These are the news of Nejd. These faithless apostates have perpetrated deeds which excites Goa's wrath upon them together with all men's anger; but it is all for the good of Uuslims \/ho have stood up as one man.
