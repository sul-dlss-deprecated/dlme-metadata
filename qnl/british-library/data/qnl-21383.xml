W. MALLESON, Ziient.-Col., A. Q. M. O.for Intelligence. Simla ; 22nd March 1907.AUTHOR’S PREPACE. In the following work, I have endeavoured to give as com plete a list as possible of all the names of tribes and localities of the Province of Kermanshah, with whatever information I was able to get regarding the same. In such an extensive work mistakes are unavoidable; and I must ask that such should he excused, considering that I have not been able to go over the whole country and verify all I have written. In compiling this Gazetteer, I was unfortunately deprived of the use of the Indian Government route hook of Persia, and of any more recent (if such exists) Gazetteer of Persia than the one of 1885. 1 have, however, perused Persian documents which it is rarely the privilege of Europeans to lay hands upon. Por the spelling “ g ” has been given its German equivalent “g,” and “ gh,” “ gu ” or “ g ” should all be taken to represent the German “g.” “ J ” equals “ dj,” “ u ” should always he taken for “ oo,” “ sh ” for the Prench “ eh,” and “ ch ” for the German “ tsch,” “ i ” for “ ee.” I have done my best to get to the real names, but in a country where Persian, Turkish, Arabic, Luristani and Kurdish are sometimes mixed up in a hopeless way, it is very often extremely difficult to avoid making mistakes. Travellers have named villages differently, according to the guides they had. A Kandulei who calls himself a Kanulei, speaks of Kaoeh mean ing Kabudeh. General Rawiinson’s “ Molla Yakud ” becomes after much inquiry “ Milleh-Yakub.” Mr. T. 0. Plowden’s “ Shila Zuliat,” I found to mean “ Chelleh-ve-Zaluab.” Another thing is noteworthy in this province, many villages, especially in the Zohab district, are reed constructions and easily removable; it often happening that through disputes or scarcity of water, a village separates into two or more settlements, some times as much as 2 or 3 miles, distant one from the other. Occa sionally the whole village is removed to a totally different spot. Through disputes or increase of population and changes of landlords and division of property, it often happens that a village gets divided into a number of hamlets. All these hamlets are usually called by the name of the original village, and the locality is named the Mulk “ so and so ” (name of the original village), hutevery h&amp;nilet lins n sep&amp;r&amp;te £md. distinct narne of its own. Tliis has caused much confusion in mapping. An example of this is found in Abbarik two villages seen on the road from Bisutun to Sahna; the property of Abbarik, is composed of seven hamlets, namely : Nejefabad and Hassanabad, Dowletabad, Reisavand, Abbasabad, Sangchin, Milleh. Some maps give to the two above- mentioned villages the name of Abbarik, others the names of Nejefabad and Hassanabad, whilst others indicate four villages, two of the name of Abbarik and the other two bearing the names of Nejefabad and Hassanabad respectively. In Kermansbah when one wants to distinguish, one speaks of Nejefabad-i-Abbarik and Hassanabad-i-Abbarik. It should also be noted that villages bear very often the name of the Kathkodaor of the Chief. Thus Soleiman Aga, a village on the Ab-i-Kurretu and marked on the Survey Department Map, is now spoken of as Ali Aga, the name of the present chief. In many maps camping grounds of the Iliyats are often marked as villages. It is essential that winter and summer camping-grounds be indicated in a special manner, such as by a red or black triangle; for in the present state of many maps of this district, it often happens that travellers, expecting to reach a series of villages indicated on their maps, only find barren tracts absolutely denuded of inhabitation and shelter. For the tribes, although my lists were got up with great care, I have given various other lists, which sometimes greatly differ, but, wishing that a traveller, desirous of obtaining more ample and correct information, should get in the present Gazetteer, some points to help, I preferred laying before him all the material in my possession. An appendix will be found at the end of the volume, explaining certain Persian words used, such as diam and adi; also the Kurdish equivalent for some of the names. In the revenue list, given under some of the Buluks, villages belonging to two or three of the great landed proprietors of Kermanshah, do not appear, as these persons have special revenue lists for their villages. Through want of time, it has been impossible to recopy the Gazetteer in perfect alphabetical order. I have consequently given an alphabetical index for use as reference. Kebmanshah : Dated the 24th June 1904&lt;. HYACINTH L, RABING.' A AB-BAMK. Salma. A small, district in the buluk of Sahna, composed of the 7 following ham lets which all bear the name of Ab-barik.

AB-BARIK SUFLA. Kuliai. Proprietors : Hajji Sheffi and others. See Kuliai. AB-BARIK ULIA.—Kuliai. Proprietor : Hajji Sheffi. See Kuliai. ABBASAN RUD— A river which has its source at Mohab and joins the Ab-i-Sirvan near Maidan [Survey Dept. Ma^ y 1897). ABBAS ABAD.—Sahna. Part of Ab-barik [qaT) in the Sahna district. ABBASAB&amp;D.—Kanga var. A village oE the Buluk of Kangavar. ABBASABAD.—Zohab. Khalesseh (crown property). A village of the Buluk of Zohab, 21 farsakhs distant from Sar-i-pol-i-Zohab, on the road from Sar-i-pol-i-Zohab to Kasr-i-Shirin. It is composed of two hamlets, numbering 24 houses. Katkhodas : Seyyed Ahmed and Abbas Khan. ^ Cultivation—rice and garden crops. The Hoi wan passes through the village. ABBASAVAND,—Sinjabis. A sub-division of the Dalian Sinjabis. In Kurdish their name is Hawasavan. ABDUL-KADER.—Mahidasht. Part of Norwullah, q.v. ABDULLAH-BEG— A halting-place in Kermanshah, one march from Zohab, on the road to Soleimanieh.— [Rawlinson, Gazetteer of Persia, 1885). ABDUL-REZAK.—Mahidasht. Part of Barazabad, q.v.2 AB-I-DIN A V AR— A river coming from the Dinavar district. It is spanned, at 1 mile from the carvanserai of Bisutun, by a brick bridge^ and joins the Gamasiaba little further down. AB-I-DIREH— A. river of Kermanshah, which joins the Holwan river at a place called Milleh Yakub, about midway between Kasr-r Shirin and Sar»i-pol. In general it is a mere brawling rivulet, but, when swollen by raio, becomes a furious rapid torrent. Rawiinson was detained two days on its bank, on one occasion. Even the bridges of woven boughs, which are thrown across in several places from bank to bank to aftord a passage in case the fords should be impracticable, are swept away at times. At the point of its junction with the Holwan, it is said to be spanned by a natural arch of rock, which is called, in consequence, Pul-i»Kboda (God's bridge). In the narrow valley, which opens into the plain of Direh, were the winter pasture grounds of the Kermanshah stud. This spot had been selected as well on account of its excellent herbage as for the security of its position; shut in between the hills on one side and the river on the other, the horses reared in it were celebrated throughout Persia, The plain is about 4 miles in length and 2 miles in breadth. It was formerly included in the Pashalik of Zohob, but after the conquest of that district by the Persians, it was purchased by the Kalhor chiefs frorn its Turkish owners. There are 150 resident families of Kalhors at Direh, and it also affords winter quarters for 400 more, who are nomadic. 1S85). A B-I-GAN GIR— The Ab i-Gangir has its source in Gilan, and joins the Belldroj river in Turkish territory. It passes through the valley of Gangir and through that of Saumar ; being used for irrigation purposes by the inhabitants of Mendali, who pay the Eivanis 100 to 150 tomans per annum in return for the use of the water. See Saumar. From the spot where the Gilan'Mendali route strikes the Ab-i-Ganjir, this latter takes a 8. W. direction, and passes by Karave Sheiken, i farsakh further on and 2| farsakhs from Yijenan.—(A. Leleux 8f II. L. Rabino, 1902-03). AB-I-KAMGA— The Kamga river has its source near the old mined carvansarai of Sarkuh - Kamga. It passes by Kalkosh and through the Kifraoor plain, and joins the Holwan. From the caravansarai of Sarkuh-Kamga up to Kalkosh, the Harunabad- Gilan road is always on the right of the river, except at ^ farsakh from Kalkosh, where, through an elbow of the river, the Ab-DKamga has to be forded twice. On leaving Kalkosh the river passes to the right, and runs along the foot of the Kal-Amir range at about 600 metres from the moun tain.— (L. LelenXy 1903). AB-I-KEBIND— Lat. 34° 16 / N. Long. 46° 14' E. Elev.~ ■&gt; i 5,500' Gerard. 5,350' Rozario. A river of Kermanshah, which rises close' to the gates of Zagros, and has a tortuous course of nearly 100 miles in a south-east direction. In the3 latter part of its course, it forces its way through the Zagros, by a tremen dous gorge, into the plain of Zenguevan. Thence, it takes the name of Ab-i-Shirwan, as it passes in a south-south-east direction through the valley of Rudbar, being increased almost at the junction by the Zengnevan, Ab-i- Shirvan, and two other streams; all of which come from the west. {Rawlinson), It flows south-east and joins the Karasu (Seimerreb) and Karkhah in Zenguevan ; the united stream is called the Kaikhah— [St, John’s Map). The Ab-i-Kerind has two sources, one to the east of the Tak-i-Gerreh pass at an elevation of 3,895 metres, the other in the mountain to rhe north of Kerind. These two streams unite in a flat valley, the average elevation of which is about 1,500 metres ; the length of the valley is 20 kilometres, and its width from 5 to 6 kilometres. To the north the valley is bordered by a rampart of limestone, practically vertical, which separates it rrom the plain of Biwanij. To the south is the great Noah-Kuh range. In leaving this valley the Ab-hKerind enters a series of gorges and defiles, where, in the space of a few kilometres it falls about 200 metres. The river then waters the plain of Harunabad, which has an elevation of about 1,300 metres. The dimensions and shape of the Basht-i-Harunabad are about the same as those of the Dast-i-Kerind, the river then enters further gorges, to descend to the mahals of Eivan and Chahar Doul, the elevation of which is between 1,000 and 800 metres. . • At Chahar-Doul the Ab-i-Kerind joins the Gamasiab Seimerreh m the middle of inaccessible gorges, the queerest of which is certainly that of Tang- i-Charmio, upper border of the Seimerreh, The difference of elevation of the Ab-i-Kerind at its source and at its junction with the Gamasiab is 1,200 metres, occurring on a distance of *120 kilometres.— (De Morgan, 1892). ^ . A little above its junction with the Seimerreh, the Ab-i-Kermd receives large river which descends from the plain of Goawur. {L/e Morgctu}. The Ab-i-Kerind is supposed to be the ancient Choaspes. AB-I-MEREK— A river of Kermanshah, which rises in the plain (at fear-Fiiuzabad) 16 miles due south of Mahidasht ; and passing that village, flows in a north direction till it joins the Karasu in the plain of Kermanshah (at the village of Kalleh Dair). This river, in dry weather, is very insignificant, but, in the winter, it becomes very impetuous, deep and rapid {Jones). B-I-REZAWAR— A rivulet in the province of Kermanshah, which rises at Sarah Shah Hussein, in the buluk of Bala Darbend, and flows into the Karasu about 4 miles above Kermanshah. The river waters part of the Kermanshah plain, known as Mabal-i-Zir-Darband, 16 miles north of Kermanshah, on the road to Senneh The Ab-i-Rezawar is a considerable stream in spring ; its water is remarkably pleasant to drink, and free from the harshness, character istic of the water supply of other places in the neighbourhood. T. C. Plowden, 1881—M. L. Rabino, W AB-I-SIRVAN A river of Kermanshah, which rises on the north of the (huh-i- ■linger4 Kuh-i-Sangar, about 40 miles west o£ Hamadan/nearly as^many north east of Kermanshahj and at nearly two degrees east of Soleimanieh. Its direction is west, inclining to north for about 40 ^ miles, then north-west more, that is as far as the ruins ; it receives, in this part of its course, numerous petty streams from the mountains of Shahi and Avroman. About 10 miles beyond Darna, in the same direction, it takes a west course of 20 miles, through the mountains of Gundar, where it receives the river of Ab-i-Zimkan, which rises near Gahwareh, in the Guran country at about 70 miles distance towards south-east. Immediately after this increase, the Ab-i-Shirvan forces its way through a narrow gorge (without even sufficient space for a footpath along its bank) into the plain of Semiran, where it is joined by a considerable affluent, formed by the waters of theTaj-Rud and Saltn. It now takes a south-west direction, still preserving the same name. Below the junction of the Soleimananieh river it receives from the Zagros, on the east side, two considerable streams, the first at 35 miles from that junction, and the second at 25 miles further on. The Ab-i-Sirvan now runs nearly south for about 30 miles, when it receives the Holvan near Khanikin, whence the united waters take the name of Diyala, On the road between Soleimanieh and Kermanshah. there is a ford at Banahkilan, which is practicable in summer, but in winter it is wholly impassable. There was formerly a substantial brick bridges over the river at this point. It is not navigable at any part of its course, but timber is frequently floated down to the Tigris from the mountains of Kurdistan. From near the town of Gundarto the plain of Shirvaneh, this river forms the boundary between Persia and Turkey. It is also called upper Diyala ; Its water is unwholesome.— (Gazetteer, 1885).

AHMADAVAND CHALABI— A branch of the great Hamavand tribe, which inhabited the neighbour hood of Kasr-bShirin and Sard-pohi-Zohab. This is what is related by Curzcn on the subject: “ A few years ago there was a noted robber chief ot the Hamavand tribe, named Jawan Mir Khan, who was the terror of the frontier district near Kasr-i-Shirin. Unable to coerce him into good behaviour, the Persians in 1880, made him guardian of the frontier, with a salary of 3,000 tomans. As he continued his depredations, he was invited to a friendly interview with an emissary from Teheran, and was treacher ously seized and slain. ^ The Ahmadavand Chalabi were claimed by the Vali of Baghdad as Turkish subjects, and, after the death of Jawan Mir Khan, they crossed the frontier and settled in Turkish territory.* A son of Jawan Mir was in Kermanshah a few months ago, but was politely asked by the Governor of Kermanshah to go and rejoin his tribe.—(190£).

The best way to get over, is to obtain inflated water skins and build a small raft. Access to this spot can also be had from the left bank of the Gamasiab. The springs are about 4 or 5 feet distant from the river, which is here imprisoned by high cliffs of solid roc-k. The springs are distant about 80 feet from each other. The Ab-i-Gizeru joins the Seimerreh a few hundred feet above this spot- From here downwards, the river formed by the united waters of the Karasu and Gamasiab, and known from their junction to this spot as Doab or Doaban, change their name to Seimerreh.

I myself believe Aliullahism to be a sort of atheism, mixed with a great number of superstitions and legends. I have never seen an Aliullahi pray, and as for the rites they are said to observe, I am inclined to think them the fabrication of hostile Mahommedan neighbours. As, however, I may be mistaken in my views, I subjoin what I huve been able to find on the subject, quoting from old authors and adding here and there various details, which have been related to me by Mussulmans inhabit ing the province of Kermanshah :— The name Aliullahi is the designation under which is known a sect, which has many adherents amongst the Kurdish tribes of Kermairshah. The Aliullahis do not like this denomination, and great care must be taken not to use the word before them. They are divided into three great branches. Aliullahi. Mai Ali. Atishbeghi. Floyer says they are divided into 4 clans : Zardai, Shuan, Nau Darwan and Nau Chasm (from Chashmeh). Ibis is surely a mistake, as these are the names of localities. The following paragraph from a letter of J. B. Fraser's, dated Sulimanieh, 1st November 1834 (Travels in Kurdistan), refers without doubt to the Atishbeghi Seyyeds of the Aliullahis, some of whom are still to be found in the village of Sahna “ It is asserted that these gifted persons will go into a sort of oven called tendour (tanur), around which fire is heaped until it is red hot ; they will heap fire upon their heads, and yet still call out “ I am cold '^and walk out unhurt. They will take a piece of red hot iron out of the fire without injury to their hands ; and in short, if we believe what is said of them, they are fireproof.' The Aliullahis believe in a series of successive incarnations of God, who is constantly present in the persons of a few of their leaders.16 Cutzoii says: “ Benjamin, Moses, Elias, David, Jesus-Christ, Ali and Haft-Tan (seven bodies) are considered the chief of these incarnations. The Halt-Tan were seven Pirs or spiritual guides, who lived in the early ages o£ Islam, being each as worshipped as the Deity, an object of adoration in some particu'ar part of Kurdistan. Baba Yadgar (-i-Hussein) was one of them. (1) The whole of the incarnations are thus regarded as one and the same person, the bodily form of the divine manifestation beino* alone changed; but the most perfect development is supposed to have taken place in the person of Benjamin, David and Ali. Ali is, indeed, frequentlv invoked by them under the name of Daoud or David ; and there are evident marks of Judaims in their creed. In the twelth century, Rabbi Beniamin of Tudela appears to have regarded them as Jews.” J “It is said that their religion enjoins, that at certain periols, they shall congregate at night m a particular spot. At these the greatest licence is said to prevail, and the prom scuous intercourse of the sexes form part of the ceremonies prescribed by their singular creed'’ (Gazetteer of Persia 1885). This festivity is named Chelaktapan or Cheragh-Kushan, and takes place 4 days before the great feast of Berklg at the beginning of the month ' The religion of the tribes of Luristan-i-Kuchik is very curious and w eU merits to be attentively observed ; for although the foundation’of all Ah-Ilanism is the same, consisting in the belief of a series of sue •e'sive incarnations, yet they have superinduced a number of local superstitions apparently of remote antiquity. The Lurs do not affect the slightest veneration for Mohammel and the Koran ; tlvir onlj genenl oh Feet, f worship is their great saint Baba Buznrg ; but there are also several ho'v men amongst them, who are considered the living representatives of the dmne principle, and who are thus regarded bv their particular disciples with a _ reverence little short of adoration. Their sacrifices and mysti cal meetings form a subject of much interest; for many of their observances are certainly to be traced to a source, long anterior to the institution of Mohammedanism Macdonald Kmneir has noticed the midnio-ht oro-ies of the Charagh Kushan. It is not probable that any snelf rites lire observed at the present day, but meetings of this nature were certainly observed within the last ee itury, and there cannot be a doubt that we may recognize m them a. relic of the worship of the principles ’of uenernW and fecundity, which had descended through the orgies of Mithra and Anatis, from the time when Sesostris erected the emblems of the sexual organs as objects of adnr ,tion, and Somimmis, delivering herself to’indis criminate pleasure, doubtless intended to fulfil a religions ceremony.- “ It is certain that a more than masonic secrecy is maintained amonw them, in regard to the mystical rites and ceremonies connected with their religion, and that they are exceedingly jealous of curious inquiries on the S U ^ ' J 0 0 v « . “ ^\ en . i ' 1 Mahommedan cities, they outwardly conform to the eeremon- ies and habits of the established faith. “ Shiel says that though their tenets are perfectly well known not the slightest attempt is made to disturb their opinions, though they do not openly proclaim their dissent from the prevailing religion”of the country, luey clo not observe Ramazan. (1) Kurds say that the town of Yezdijird was taken by Imam Hussein in r • Imamzadeh was erected. Eaba I’adgar is certainly not the name of one of the Haft Tans. thi917 . &gt;V &lt;f In tlieir own villages they do not deny themselves the use of wine and spirits, nor do they abstain from the prohibited food oj: the^ Koran, on the contrary, they indulge freely in swine s flesh and intoxicating liquors (Gazetteer of Persia). u The Aliullahis have no religious books and rarely, if ever, pray. They say that Ali is their intercessor, and has commanded them to trust to the efficacy of his prayers : and in short, Ali is their intercessor with God. Before undertaking any important matter, and especially before going to war, the Aliullahis invoke Ali, in the name of Daoud, saying : “ O Daoud, we are going to war, grant that we may overcome our enemies/' They then sacrifice some beast, usually a sheep; the blood and offal are buried, and the rest of the animal is roasted whole. When it is cooked, the carcass is carried to the priest, who separates the bones and kneads the flesh into a paste, muttering prayers over it as he proceeds. When he has finished this consecration, a table cloth is spread on the ground, and every one present partake of the food which the priest distributes. After this ceremony the undertaking, whatever it may he, is entered upon with per fect confidence of ultimate success. Every year, at the commencement of winter, there is a great festival which ends with a three days' feast. The festival is in honour and remembrance of Ali, and of .the great things he has done for his followers.”— (T. C. Plow- den, 1S81). This feast is preceded by the Chelaktapan, of which mention has already been made. Then there is the three days' feast, known as Berkh, which takes place at the beginning of the month of Kauss. Every family of ten persons has to kill a fowl, some of them are of course at liberty to kill a sheep. The following is the derivation of the name of this feast (Justi. diet. Kurde-Franeab.) :— Berkh agneau. Berkhbyr—fete que les Kurdes observent al’occasion de la tonte des brebis, qui tombe au mois de tabakh ( aout), du mot precedent et de bar, forme radicale de bariden, ‘ couper/’ Houtum Schindler observes as to Ibis feast (in the Zeitschrift d. Peutschen Morgenlandt Gesellschaft XXXVIII, page 110) :— “Die von mir gefragten Kurden sersicherten, dass dieses lest nur von den Kurdischen Ali Ullahis und von den Yezidis gefeiert werde,' “ Seyyed Bust am is the name of the present chief of the Aliullahis of Zohab ; he lives at Zardeh (Tushami), the sacred place of the sect on Mount Dalahu. There is here a tomb in which no body is buried, but which is venerated under the title of Baba Yadgar-i-Hussein. “ The marriages of this sect are supposed to require the sanction of the chief priest, but resort is, not infrequently had to Shiah Mullahs. The dead are buried without prayer, but the head of the corpse faces Kerbela, as amongst Mussulmans. On the birth of a child, the father and mother give it its name, but if the family is well-to-d&gt;, a Seyyed is invited to a feast on the seventh day after its birth, and is called to name it/'—-(7 7 , C. Plowden, 1881). The Chiefs of the Aliullahis consider smoke impure. Corpses are kept in deceased^ bouse for 6 days before burial. The Aliullahis are easily recognized by their long mustachios, as Shiahs, according to their religion, have to cut their mustaehios so that no hair should hang beneath the upper lip. The chiefs of the sect in the Province18 or Kermaiishah are : Aga Seyyed Rustam, who lives in Tushami, hetwee Gahwarreh and Biwanij on the Ziaikan river, where his ancesters h iv always resided, He shows, with pride, a forest (now sacred) planted hr 1,'° grandfather, and boasts of never having had a tree cut down. The trees have reached a very great height, and show what could be done, if it weie decided to rewood all these mountains. The other chiefs are Abdul Azim M trza Aga Bakbsh at Garrebao, one stage from Hersin, and his brother Sb»h Mohammad Mekdi, ibn Hassan, who is now a prisoner in Teheran for having rebelled in Mazeuderan. Copy of the inscription on his banner is given heieafter. The following is narrated by T C. Plowden, but I have not verified it by inquiries : “ A leading tradition, upon which their belief in the divinity of Ali mainly rests, was related to me as follows : ‘ During the religious wars_ which ensued after the death of Mohammed, Ali, accompanied by a certain _ Mussayir, was about to engage in battle with the Arabs Mussayir’s mother implored Ali to bring back her son alive. In the fisriit Mussayir was killed, but God accepted All’s intercession and restored the dead man to life. This resurrection of Mussayir was repeated on 6 sub sequent occasions through Ali’s influence, with the result that Mussavir began to reverence Ah as God, and as All’s conquests proceeded and were signalised by many miracles, the general public also began to look upon ium as the Almighty. In remembrance and in perpetual proof of Mus sayir s having been seven times restored to life, his descendants have ever since consisted of seven families, never more nor less. No one, however knows where the descendants of Mussayir reside, though they are to be recognised by a red mark on the neck, which all of them carry/” Morier relates the following “ Part of this tribe (Lak) look upon Ali as God, and are called Nasan, from the name of their chief, who they say nst gave rise^to this doctrine. It is affirmed that Mohammed sen/Nasar the htTer al Znf ’n 11 hi , S , Wa f s ’ that; '’hen they reached the Shatt-ul-Arab, ancient fish replied^ ‘ who'se^t'you^to 8 ufkaows^the 6 S'” upm!

(II. L, Rabino, 1905.) General hawlinson also mentions that “ the tomb of Baba Yadgar, at the time of the Arab invasion of Persia, was regarded as the abode of Elias.”— The majority of the Gurans, Kerindis, Sinjabis and Lekks are Aliullahis. The Bev. Tisdale of Bushire says : “ The inhabitants of Gahwareh are supposed to be the remnants of the early Babylonians or Samarians (2nd Kings XVII : 6 to 7). They are not Moslems but Aliullahi Gurans, the retention of their religion and mysterious usages will correspond with the anathemas launched at them by Moses in Deut. XXVIII, 30 and following verses : and in Levit., 26, 32, 33, and 39th verses. Yassin Teppeh, close by, is supposed to be the Besin of Geneses.” B AB A J AN—Baladeh.

BAJLAN— The Bailans, under Persian rule, barely number 200 families. Their chiefs are Aziz Khan at Kurretu and Kader Aga at Bishkan. Kader^ Aga and Aziz Khan are constantly at feud one with the other. Rader Aga s son was killed in March 1902. To prevent the frequent recurrence of fights and effusion of blood the Governor of Kermanshah has removed Kader Aga Irom Bishkan to Kurretu, thus separating the rival families. The Baiilans are Sunnis. # . . . The Banians occupy the territory which extends from Kasr i-Shirtn to the frontier. As a pretection against the incursions of Jafts, Kader Aga has a post of 50 horsemen, at Bishkan a Kal leading from the north of the plain of Zohab to the plain of Sarkalleh. Aziz Khan has a post of 100 horsemen at 1 Accordin°- to Sir H. Kawlinson, the Bajlans are said, with the connivance of the Government of Kermanshah, to have been driven out by the Gurans from Darnah in about the year 1700 and to have been obliged to confine themselves to the plains, in which, shortly afterwards, the Bajilan Pasha founded the town of Zohab. p , . , npnhirv The 1885, Gazetteer says the Bajilans are refugees of the last century, from the vicinity of Mosul.22 De Morgan says that Kurretu was built onty a few 3 r ears ago, by the Kurdish chief Aziz Khan, on the right bank of the Zobab river. Aziz Khan was a Turkish subject ; he is the chief of the Bajilans (Jaffs) and was formerly a famous robber. About 12 years ago Zil-es-Sultan invited him to Isfahan and offered him the keeping of the frontier. Up till that time the country had constantly been devastated by the Bajlans themselves, i -es-Sultan granted Aziz Khan a large extent of waste land between the olwan and the Diyala ; had him named a General and granted him a salary of 60 tomans per annum. Aziz Khan then undertook an expedition m urkey in order to remove, as much as possible^ the tribes which he sus pected of unfriendliness. He then returned and built Kurretu, where he stationed the greater number of bis horsemen. He built other villages nearer the frontier and there settled his sons and relatives; the Persian frontier is now well guarded. But these same Bajlans, brought up in brigandage, are now to Turkey what they were to Persia and very often devastate the adjoining territory {De Morgen.) At Hoshkury the inhabi tants are of the Shakeli branch of Bajlans.— {L. Leleux). nu ^bers about 600 families and can raise 250 horsemen, but part of these are Turkish Bajlans from Markaz and Bankudrep who in return tor similar services, are ready, in case of need, to help their friends. This tribe, as long as Aziz Khan was alive, floated between Turkish and Persian allegiance. _ Aziz Khan by his daring and courage had succeeded, to a large extent bv Ins impudence, in making himself feared by his neighbours. ^ Aziz Khan, Shuja ul Marnalek, died in Nov. 1903 of grief, in not beino able to revenge the death of his sons. ^ Kader Aga with his.followers, some 50 horsemen, inhabit the village of J ■ la 'i L • /’ifY' 1 t l ?, r,,a ” 1 ° f Hels .constantly endeavouring to create mise nef between the Gurans and the Bajlans, in order to cause as much tiouhle as possible to his nephew Kerim Khan, the son of Aziz Khan, who succeeded his father as chief of the tribe. Kerirn Khan inhabits the village of Kuretu (80 houses). His younger brother Kadei Aga inhabits the vdlage bearing his name. The villao-e of Sirvan, which belonged to t his tribe, is now a heap of ruins, in consequent-e of disputes with Mahmud Pasha Jaff. The village of Hoshkury, on the frontie. also belongs to this tr.be; and Kerim Khan has allowed fugitives from Turkey Hoshkury! re ‘ 18 Hajji Selitns who is now k ^khoda Kerim Khan supplies 15 horsemen and 15 tufangcbis to the D’Arcv concession worts, at a salary of 15 and 10 tomans respectively. 7 territory. 11 W6llS bel ° ng t0 th6 Bajlan but th ® Chiasurkh eam P on Guran 1904) B ^ laDS and Sllarafbaills are agriculturists and shepherds.” BAJLAN—Mabidasht.

The rock of Bisutun is nearly perpendicular. The surrounding c ountry is crossed by numerous irrigation streams, dotted with many villages and covered with corn crops. A large caravanserai, but accommodation iu houses fair. (//. A Sawyer.) Ask for house of Haider Khan Sartip. Elev.—4,500 ft. [Survey Department map) Bisutun, which is famous on account of the inscriptions and tablets of Darius, was, by its position on the high way from Ecbatana to Babylon, a fit place for the records of the exploits of the various monarchs who had marched their armies across this country. “The position assigned to Bagistan (The hill of Jove according to Diodorus) by both writers [i e. Isidore and Diodorus), and the description of Diodorus, identify the place, beyond a doubt, with the now famous Behistan (Bisutun), where the plain, the fountain and the scarped surface are still to be seen, though the supposed figure of Semiramis, her pillar and29 inscription have disappeared. They were probably destroyed by Kbosrow Par viz when be prepared to build a palace on tbe site/' {George Rawlin- son), Tbe etymology of Bisutnn bas often been given as u Bisutun” witbout columns, or “ Bist-Sutun^ twenty pillars, but, it is quite certain that we must see in it a corruption of tbe ancient Baghistan, just as Tak-i-Bostan is tbe corruption of another ancient name, and should not be translated ‘The arch of the (fruit) garden/'* The sculptures and inscriptions at Bisntun consist of : Large smooth surface called Farhad Tarasb. Inscription and bas-relief of Darius. Inscription and bas-relief of Gotarzes, over part of which bas been added an Arabic inscription. Polished surface probably prepared in order to receive an inscription. Sassanian sculpture. Old remains in tbe village. The Paehad Tarash.—^.*., Place cut by Farhad.)— This large surface was being polished to a great height, tbe idea being to build a palace attached to it, tbe roof of which was to rest in a deep oroove cut over tbe polished surface. At the foot of tbe hill a large plat form was begun, in order that tbe palace might be at a certain elevation, Lorn which it would have commanded a fine view of tbe plam Large blocks bad to be removed from tbe surface of the rock, and on these cau be seen the impressions of instruments used, or the boles in which wood was inserted, either to detach these blocks from tbe rook, or to remove them when detach ed. No doubt the death of tbe King, for whom this palace was being built, stopped tbe building operations. Some authors say Kbosrow Parviz is the monarch who ordered this pal ice to be built. Mr. De Morgan believes this surface was simply prepared to receive an inscription and bas-relief. a rp lie lower p ar t of tbe cliff bas been scarped to a great height, apparently for tbe back wall of some extensive building, which probably formerly existed, or at any rate was partly finished, as the materials are lying at tbe foot of’the cliff in great abundance, consisting principally of massive blocks of hewn stone; a wall of the same surrounds a large teiraced space on which the building stood, and the declivity of the mountain is piled with square blocks much timeworn, but in the centre of many of which, a letter or sign is apparent; tbe caravanserai is built from these ruins, and the stones have • The following is what is related by Pietro della Valle in 1618 : “Dlese Herberg war eine -arke Ta^eiss von dannen und neben etlichen andern klemen hausern unten an dem Fuss ernes tbr X® Ber^s erst neulich gebauet dass es scheinet als seye sie auss drucklich zu einer Mauer aus dem ?d 8 en gewn worto S Man nenn.t dlesen ort anf Persianisch Bcohr-K.n, dast ..t n.ue Stadt eit man diesilbe erst vor kurtzer Zeit zu bauen augefangen bat.30 ~ abo these signs, which, however, do not appear to belong to any alphabet. * Some of them are as follows :—- The first sign was on a stone in the ruins, the others in the caravanserai. The only sculpture on the scarp was a single female mask ; from the foot of the rock, the foundation of a massive wall runs down across the plain to the vicinity of the caravan serai. ^ ( E. L % Mitford F, li. G, 8, From England to Ceylon forty years ago, 1884), Inscription and Bas-Relief of Darius— The inscriptions and bas-reliefs of Darius are at about 300 ft above the ground, and consist of a large inscription^ occupyinga surface about 150 ft. long and 100 ft. high, and containing an inscription in cuneiform in old Persian, with translations in new Babylonian and new Susian or Elamite. One-third of the whole is illegible, the Persian inscription being the most damaged. It contains a memorial of the doings of Darius Hystaspes (521-185 B.C.) and the history of the defeat of bis rivals or enemies, who are represented in the bas-relief immediately over the inscrip tion. One can, with no great difficulty, get to within 30' of the inscription, but to get np to the inscription, a rather dangerous climb of some 100', is necessary. The bas-relief represents Darius with a bow in bis hand and the prostrate figure of Gaumata under him ; behind are two warriors, one holding a bow, the other a spear. In front are the various rebels or enemies he overcame, all tied to each other by the neck. The figure of Darius is larger than the others. Above is the figure of divinity or Auramazda (Ormuzd), holding a circlet in one hand and pointing towards Darius with the other. There are tablets (11 in all) over the King for the prisoners, givino* their names ; with the exception of the tablet for Gaumata which is under him and the one of the third prisoner which is partly on him and partly behind/ All the tablets are in the three above mentioned languages except the first and last, in which the new Babylonian translation has been omitted. The following is the translation of the 11 tablets :— lirst tablet, nearly a repetition of the first four paragraphs of the loro’p inscription under the bas-relief ° x a ge I am Darius, the great King, the King of Kings, King of Persia Kino* of the Provinces, the son of Hystaspes, the grandson of Arsames the Achaememan. 1 bus spoke Darius, the King : ‘ My father was Hystaspes of Hj staspes, the father was Arsames of Arsames, the father was Aria latrines of Ariaramnes, the father was Teispes of Teispes, the father was Acnaemens . tUrns spoke Darius, the King : ' On that account we are called Achae- menians. Since the time of our ancestors we have reigned. Since the time of mir ancestors were we a royal race.’ Thus spoke Darius, the King • Eight of my ancestors were kings : 1 am the ninth. In two lines (branches of my family) there have been nine kingsY' taro31 Second tablet. “This Gaumata the Magiau lied : thus did he speak : ( I am Bardiya son of Cyrus^ I am king/ ^ Third tablet. (( This is Atrina, thus did he speak : f I am king of Susiana/ ” Fourth tablet. “ This &gt;Jidintu-Bel lied, thus did be speak: am Nabukadrezar, son of Nabunaid, I am kiug of Babylon/ ;; Fifth tablet. “Tins Fravartis lied, thus did be speak: ‘I am Khsathrita, of the race of Uvakhstra, I am king of Media/ ” Sixth tablet. “This Martiya lied, thus did he speak am Ummanis, king of Susiana' ” Seventh tablet. “ This Citrantakhma lied, thus did he speak : C I am King of Sagartia, of the race of Uvakshtra/ ” Eighth tablet. “This Yahyasda'a lied; thus did he speak : ‘ I am Bardiya, son of Cyrus, 1 am king/ Ninth tablet. “This Arakha lied, thus did he speak: M am Nebukadiezar, son of Nabunaid, I am king of Babylon/ ” Tenth tablet. ° This Frada lied, thus did he speak : ‘ I am king of Margiana/ ” Eleventh tablet. “This is Skunka the Scythian/’ As no mention of this latter is made in the large inscription it is pre sumed that his image was added to the panel at a later period. The large inscription gives us the names of the various counfries over which Darius ruled: “Thus spoke Darius, the King: 4 These are the countries which belong to me, by the will of Auramazd i (Ormuzd) have I become king of them : Persia, Uvaja (Susiana), Babel (Babylon), Assyria, Egypt, those of tbe Sea (the isles of the Sea), Lydia (Sparta), Lonia, Media, Armenia, Cappadocia, Parthia, Drangiana, (Zarangia), Aria, Chorasmia, Bactria, Sogdiana, Gandara, Scythian (the Saeae), the Satta gydes, Arachotia, Mekra (Mecia); in all twenty-three countries/ ” The rest of the inscription relates the victories of Darius over the per sonages who are represented in the panel, except Skuuka the Scythian who is not mentioned. “But how laboriously and conscientiously, these ancient craftsmen worked. First the surface of the rock was smoothed, then every crevice or unsound place was either stopped with lead or filled with inlaid stone, so nicely fitted that the joining escapes the eye. Then the characters were chiselled, with an accuracy and a regularity, quite marvellous. Finally, over all was spread a coating qf siliceous varnish, as a protection from theI sa ravages of the climate; its broken or denuded flakes being, even now, infi nitely harder than the rock itself/”— [Carson.) Inscription and Bas-Reliep of Gotarzes—• To the right, at the foot of the mountain, is another panel with some muti lated equestrian figures. From a much defaced Greek inscription whHi runs above the panel, we learn that it is meant for Gotarzes (46-51 A. D.), probably as a commemoration of the defeat, in the plain down below, of his rival Mithrates. The name of Gotarzes can be distinctly read. Unfortunately, Sheikh Ali Khan Zengeneh had an excavation, some 8 inches deep, cut in the centre of this panel, and, on the smooth surface thus obtained, he commemorated in Arabic the donation he made, of the villages of Karayelli and Chambetan, for the upkeep of the caravansarai which he built at Bisutun. One then comes to a smoothed and polished surface of the rock, which was probably meant to receive an inscription. Sassanian Sculpture— Further on there is a large monolith, on one side of which are to be seen the images of two personages and a fire altar; the figure on the right is much defaced, the figure on the left is holding a cup in one hand and taking oil from it to pour on the fire. There is no doubt as to this being a Sassanian sculpture, but there is no inscription. Still further on, one comes to the foundations of a building forming a quadrangle. This is the spot originally chosen for the Bisutun caravan serai, but which was not approved of by Sheikh Ali Khan Zengeneh. On the other side of the Gamasiab, at a distance of about 1 mile from Bisutun, there is a hill on which can be seen the remains of fortifications and intrenchments. This was the camp of Nadir Shah's Army, and is called, by the Persians, Sangar-i-Naderi or Sangar-i-Nader Shah. Near Bisutun are also to be seen the ruins of an old Sassanian bridge, now all in ruins. In the village itself one sees the remains of a palace and a capital, similar to those found at Tak-i-Bostan. In the cemetery close by are many tombs with old Kufic inscriptions. BITERBAN.—Assadabad. A village of the Assadabad district. BIVEH-JASHNIAN, Sinjabis. Biveh-Jaslmian-Baba-Kerem-Khan.

CHAHARZEBAR—» A pass in the province of Kermanshah, over the Kal-i-Gazi range, bet ween the plain of Mahidasht and the valley of Kerind. The ascent from the Mahidasht side commences about 4 miles from the Khan of Mahidasht and continues for 3 miles, the road being very rough and somewhat sinuous. There is then the plain of Zobeideh (Zebiri) to be crossed for some 3 miles, then another ascent of the Nal-Shikan pass, over a very difficult ridge of sheet rock and broken stones, ill-adapted for the passage of laden mules, and, indeed, from its steepness affording but a precarious footing even to the unhampered beast?. The Chaharzebar and Nalshikan passes may be pro nounced almost insurmountable for artillery in their present state. Moham med Ali Mirza, Prince of Kermanshah, fortified these passes and defeated here'the Turkish Army on its invading Kermanshah territory. It forms an admirable position for defence.— “ The Kurkur and Lalaban ranges of mountains are formed of three parallel ranges; the first range bprders the Mahidasht plain at about 138 farsakh from the caravanserai. The second and third ranges follow one another, and are distant farsakh from the first range. The pass ends at i farsakh from the village of Chaharzebar Sufla. The pass has the shape of two funnels joined by the wide end. On leaving the pass there is a path which leaves the main road and is followed by foot-travellers. It passes by Larini and thence goes on to Harunabad. It is said to be one farsakh shorter than the main route. On leaving the Gardaneh Shaharzevar ; the main road forms a slight curve northwards and then strikes towards the plain of Zebiri to the south, forming an angle of about 120° with the Kuh-i-Lalaban/'— (L.

It is formed by a arge plain on the road from Kerman shah to Tabriz; and is entered by the Tang-i- Millehmass and ends at the Tang-hDinavar. Most of the hamlets belong to Azam-ed-Dowleh, a few to Mansoor es- Sultaneh. There were formerly great rice'fields in this district, but, for the last three years, great drought of water has prevailed. The inhabitants are very poor, and are descended from the Kuliai, Jelilavand, Mafi and NanekalL There are many Jews, but of the old Armenian population not a family remains. Their village has preserved its name of Armenidjan, but its inhabitants are Mussalmans. Napier .says, fl An open plain to the north of Bisutun. It contains about 80 villages or hamlets, lying in the picturesque fertile valleys of two streams, Kangarshah and Janniser, which unite at the defile called Tang-i-Dinavar. The Chief of the district estimates the surplus grain produce at about 6,000 Kharvars or 2,500 tons. It now finds its way chiefly to Hamadan. A considerable number of horses and mules might be found in the district, and fuel and forage in large quantities. The road at Tang- i-Dinavar winds for 7 miles between towering precipices, and would be difficult to traverse in the face of any determined opposition ; its flanks for many miles being inaccessible, and when accessible, so flanked by sheer scarps as to be nearly impracticable to direct assault. A detour, of about 20 to 50 miles from Dinavar east, over a low pass turns the defile: crossed with ease by horsemen and laden camels, leads to Sahna, a station on the high road.” The plain of Dinavar derives its name from the town of the same name, the ruins of which extend from the village of Zibajub to that of Sheikhan : coins of the Achamcenian period and ruins of various periods are found at this spot.

DUKKAN-I-DAUD-- A ranfje of limestone rocks, running down the Zohab valley, in the Kermanshah province. A curious monument in Malwar (?) district of Kerman shah: it is a royal sepulchre excavated in the rock, and is known as Dukkan-i-Daud or David's shop.'— (Taylor.) “ The most curious monument of Holvan is found at the corner of the upper gorge, about two miles up the valley. Ihis is a royal sepulchre ex cavated in the rock, exactly similar in character to the tombs of Persepolis : the face of the rock has been scraped to the height of 70 feet, at which elevation has been excavated a quadrangular recess 6 feet deep, 8' high and 80' wide: in the centre of the recess is the opening into the tomb, which, as in the case of those o£ Persepolis, has been forcibly broken in. The interior is rude, containing on the left hand side the place for the deposit ot the dead, being a section of the cave divided off by a low partition, about 2 feet high. Outside are the remains of two broken pillars, which have been formed out of solid rock, on either side of the entrance; the base and a small piece of either shaft appear below, and the capitals adhere to the roof of the recess, the centre part of each column have been destroyed. Upon the smooth face of the rock, below the cave, is an unfinished tablet, the figure of a Mubidar high priest of the Magi appears standing with one hand raised in the act of benediction, and the other grasping a scroll, which, I conclude, represents the sacred leaves of the Zend-Avesta ; he is clothed in the pontifical robe, and .wears the square panel cap and lappets covering the mouth, described by Hyde as the most ancient dress of the priests of Zoroaster. There is a vacant space in the point, apparently intended for the fire alter, before the priest. This tomb is named by the Ali Illahis : Dukkan-i-Daud or David's shop ; for the Jewish monarch is believed by them to have followed the calling of a smith. The broken shafts are called the anvils, and the part of the tomb, which is divided off by the low partition, is, supposed to be the reservoir to contain water for tempering the metal. David is really believed by the Ali Illahis to dwell here, though invisible, and the smithy is consequently regarded by them as a place of extreme sanctity. I never passed by this tomb without seeing the remains of a bleeding sacrifice, and the old Ali Illahis prostrate them selves on the ground, making the most profound reverence immediately they come near the spot. In regard to the Samaritan captivity, I regard this superstitious veneration for David and the offering of Kurbans or sacrifices at his supposed shrine as a very curious subject.”™ (Rawlinson.) Mr. De Morgan is of opinion that there was an inscription in the panel, above mention el, which has become defaced. - —61 DUKULBANEH—Kuilai.

Towards the Anderun (women's apartments) there is a large garden, with tanks and plenty of water, extending up to the gate at the op})osite end. The Anderun is w r ell pro portioned, has many rooms and is a fine building. It h«is a fine Hammam Ibath) when I visited the building ; the eunuchs and servants of the harem have separafe apartments. The Biruni (reception rooms) is a fine three storeyed building on the bank of the Karasu. It has a fine reception room giving on either side, but as it is situated to the west, from four hours before sunset, till sunset, the rooms are exposed to the sun.” {Nasr-ed* Din Shah, Journey to Kerbela.) “The Emadieh is on the banks of the Karasu, half way between the town and Tak-i-Bostan ; once a beautiful summer residence with a lovely garden and well appointed anderun (women's quarters), built by the Emad-ed- Dowleh not forty years ago, and occupied by the late Shah when he made his pilgrimage te Kerbela. The story goes that when the famous70 Governor of Kermanshah offered the palace as a present to the Sovereign, the Shah asked how much it had cost, and on being told a hundred thou sand tomans, was graciously pleased to restore the gift to its owner and to accept the money value instead. However that may be, the Emadieh is now a complete ruin, the villagers going thereto collect bricks ; not a solitary tree is left standing in the once lovely garden.” (//. J. Whigh am, Morning Post, 11th July 1903), The heirs of Emad-ed- Dowleh preferred seeing this splendid property go to ruin rather than have to face the expense of entertaining for many days any new Governor who thought it his right to put up here before entering Kermanshah, and whose expenses, as well as those of his suites, had consequently to be defrayed by the proprietors.

The latter runs south-west till it meets the former on the plain of - Maran about 10 miles south-west of Kanagavar, and at a spot nearly 10 miles south of that place ; it is joined by the third or chief branch of the Karkhah, which comes from the Garan mountains by a north-west course of 40 miles. The trunk of the three united streams, under the above name, then winds for nearly thirty miles in a general west direction to Bisutun, where it is crossedby a good brick bridge, chiefly along the Garan mountains At this celebrated spot the Gamasiab receives the Ab-i-Dmawar, coming from the north, and again, after a course of about 12 miles nearly south-west, another stream “called the Karasu, passes through Kermanshah at about 20 miles north-north-west of that place. From this it is called Karasu. Schindler says the Kalan and Nehavend streams together form the Gama siab. Plow den says the Gamasiab and Karasu join 15 miles from Kerman- sh&amp;h—{Gazetteer.) “The Gamasiab leaves the plain of Assadabad and Nehavend at Kenga- var, and enters deep gorges which it has cut through the secondary ranges of the Delakh ani-Kuh. From there it passes near the Bisutun rocks. Just before reaching this spot it receives the Ab-i-Dinavar, a small river which has its rise between Kuh-i-Sherish Khan and Kuh-i-Delakhani, and waters the Dinavar plain. After having received the Ab-i-Dinayar, the Gamasiab flows through a narrow plain. After its junction with Die Karasu from the Kermanshah plain, it forces its way through the defiles and gorges of fang-i-Galla, the loveliest gorges to be found in Persia. Many rivers join the Gamasiab, the most important ones being the Tueh Rud (Chom Tui), Huleilan Rud, Balawa Rnd and Ab-i-Karind. Near Shir van, the Gamasiab enters Luristan under the name of Seimer- reh and forms the boundary between the Governorships of Khorremabad and Puslit-F Kuh( De Morgan^ GANGIR— A spot in the plain of Eivan, where the Ab-i-Gangir has it rise.73 GAN DUMB AN—Mahidasht.

This popu lation has been overpowered by the Kalhurs and Zengenehs, and thus form a new tribe, under the name of Gurans. The sedentary families of the Gurans have preserved their old language, whilst the nomad families speak the Kalhur and Zengeneh Kurdi. CUBANS— A Kurdish tribe of Kermansh.ih.

Kalleh Zanjir and Mount Dalahu are included in it. It ends east of the plain of Zohab. The Sharafbaims and Bajilan separate the Gurans from the frontier. The present chief of the Gurans is Hussein Khan, Mansoor-ul-Mulk Amir Toman, son cf Assadullah Khan, who is both Sartip and Governor ot the tribe and district. Mohammad Vali Khan, Khan Klinnan, Mirpanj, son of Mansocr : ul- Mulk by a Kadjar princess, is Naib-ul-Hokomeh. Former chiefs were ; Mustapha Khan, grandfather of Mansoor-ul-Mulk. Soleiman Khan, cousin of AssaduPah Khan. Assadullah Khan, father of Hussein Khan. Azizullah Khan, uncle of Hussein Khan. Ali Murad Khan, son of Assadullah Khan and brother of Hussein Khan, Some years ago the Sultans of the tribes, at the instigation of Aga Q evved Rustam, “rebelled against Mansoor-ul-Mulk, who had to spend laie sums to induce them to submit to his authority again. From that time he has lost many of his properties, and the greater part of his avitho.- rity and influence over the tribe. 4msi flie Gurans number from 4,000 to 5,000 families^ of which about 2,500 are ie deh-nishin ^ or tf yeilaki ” i.e., sedentary, having settled in villages in the Guran territory, whilst the remainder are garmsiri^ or nomads, who go with their cattle in the plain of Zohab for the^winter. The principal yeilak of the Gurans is the Mount Dalahu and its sur roundings, where they pass the summer. The Gurans are divided into six principal branches j—* (1) Gahwarreh ; (2) Baziani | (3) Nirrji ; (4) Kalkhani; (5) Bibiyani or Buyani j (6) Kalleh Zanjiri; and the two Small Jaff tribes known as Jaff-i-Kader-Murid Waissi and Jaff-i-Taishi. The chiefs of the tribe are Sbiabs. The first six branches are Aliullahis and the Jaffs are Sunnis. These latter, who have settled in the plain of Sarkalleh north of Zohab, are Jaffs who have separated from the great Jaff tribe of Soleimanieh. Mahmood Pasha, chief of the great Jaff tribe, has lately made great efforts to induce the Jafls, who have joined the Gurans, to return to his rule, and has threatened them with severe reprisals should they refuse. The Gurans furnish a regiment of infantry, divided into eight companies, each nominally 100 strong, with a Sultan at the head of each. Ihe regi ment has no band.

In 1S34 when British officers were attached to the Persian Army, Sir -Henry Kawlinson raised a regiment of Gurans. I he tribe is rich in sheep, goats and oxen, but has few horses and mares. I neir land is mil hat. Of this tribe. Sir Henry Rawlinson wrote as follows “ Shortly after the ime o Sultan Miu ad, the Kalhor tribe, which had been driven out of partang and Darnah, assumed to themselves the peculiar designation of Uurans, which had been previously applied to the Kurdish peasantry as distinguished from the elans ; and the=e Gurans at the same time, broke into three dist,net tribes of Kalleh Zanju-i, Kerindi and B.waniji, the names hemg derived from their several p'aees of residence. They are said, wiih the connivance of the Government of Kermanshah, to have driven the Kainans out of Darnah in about the year 1700, and to have obliged the latter to confine themselves to the plains in which, shortly afterwards, the Ha.] 11 an Pasha founded the town of Zoliab }) OI P 0st . milmte inquiries and studies by Dr. Mann, it would appear t.iac this dirtrict was m olden times inhabited by a sedentary population, who spoke the so-called Tajik dialect of the interior of Persia.

They are all nomads with the except ion of the inhabitants of Gahwareh. The Gurars, whose territory extends from Biwanij to Ab-i-Sirvan, can raise 3,000 horsemen, but the weak character of their chief has greatly diminished the influence of this tribe at the frontier Mansur-ul-Mulk has tred to make up for this by family connections with Daoud Khan, Ilkhani of the Kalhors, his son- in-law. The plain of Zohab belongs to the Gurans as summer pasture land. The town of Zohab, formerly a great centre of cultivation, was able to raise 200 horsemen. It now can only boast of ruins and of a population of 50 families. The husbandmen, being villagers of the Shah, are under the authority of the Governor of Sar*i-pol-i-Zohab. Up till last year, the Government of Sar-i-pol was entrusted to the Chief of the Gurans, with fatal results to the district. It is natural that the Chief of the tribe should endeavour to increase the number of his sub jeets, by enticing husbandmen to adopt the nomadic life. The nomads themselves, being only responsible to their chn-f, oppress and rob the villagers ; and, when migrating from one place to another, allow their cattle to ruin the crops/'' (Cesari, 1904.) Je mshid Sultan, of the Gurans, died in June 1904 from cholera. By the death of Jemshid Sultan and of Khan Khanan, the policy of the Guran tribe is completely upset. Jemshid Sultan and Khan Khanan intended declaring themselves independent of Mansur-ul-Mulk, the hereditary chief. Khan Khanan, had he been promised help from the Kermanshah Gov ernment, would readily have turned his father, Mansur-ul-Mulk, out of the Guran country, whilst Jemshid Sultan by his extraordinary “physique/' his intelligence and good manners, is said to have commanded respect from all who approached him.

Thence by the Milleh Takht-Khan it goes to Talandasht, passes the village of Hajji Yais and reaches the Gaduk Ziu Ve Gereh. A road known as Domb-i-Hajji Guli, which has no p isses, joins this road on the other side of Zin Ye Gereh. The road then goes to Manarik, Tueh Kboshkeh, Shuan, Surkhak, Paiingird, Kharrek-Ab and Akhond-Rah, and reaches Harasam.

I LI Y ATS. “ The Iliyats are not originally Persians, but may be compared to foreign shoots grafted on the main stalk. The original Persian is to be found m the cities, and in the old established towns and districts of the provinces. The accretion of new population flowed in both from the east and from tbe west. Until the conquest of Persia by the Saracens, her people might be said to be unmixed; they having conquered the country, spread them selves even to Balkh, Bukhara, and Merv ; were incorporated with t he Persian nation, and, it is said, first inoculated it with roving propensities. The next tribe of wanderers was brought from the east in A.D. with Jangiz Khan, which was followed by a Taimur, who crossed and re-crossed Persia so frequently that many of bis hordes were left in Turkey. Such, in general terms, may be called the origin of the Iliyats, but each tribe has its own particular history, recording whence it came and by whom it was introduced into Persia. Many have become inhabitants of. cities and villages; there fore the tribes are classed into what are called Shahr-nishin, or dwellers in cities, or Sahra-nishin, or dwellers in the field. A few only adhere to their original modes of life, and abide all the year round in tents ; in the winter keeping to the plains, and in the summer seeking the pasturage of the mountains. In their own estimation they look upon the Shahr-nishin as degenerate, applauding the hardihood and simplicity of manners of those who have no other dwelling place than the tent, and reviling those who recur to the luxuries of a house and the protection of a city. “It does not appear thatany of the tribes have written-records, and it must be confessed that the information here acquired, concerning their numbers, must be held as very uncertain. The traditions of the tribes are oral, and, whenever they pretend to great antiquity, they immediately ascend to the fabulous ages of their historians, where all is darkness ; and they do not possess any popular ballads, which can throw light upon their history. Each tribe has a patois of its own, bearing more or less affinity to the Persian, but whatever books they possess are in the Persian language. (The Kurds have Kuidijdi books).101 “ The different, tribes are now so spread throughout t lie provinces, that they have almost lost that union which could render them formidable. It is evidently the policy of the Government to disperse them, and it does so, keeping their chiefs as hostages about the person of the King. iC Such of the tribes, as have become inhabitants of cities, are subject to the laws and regulations which rule the community they have adopted: generally speaking, they are employed as servants, attached to their Khans, either in a military or domestic capacity. “ The Sahra-nishin, although taxed in various ways and made to con- tr.bute to the military exigencies of the State, are comparatively less molested than the other inhabitants. Their wealth consists principally in cattle, which yields them a considerable revenue, and which they prefer to that produced by the cultivation of the soil. They breed camels and horses for sale, and their sheep yield milk, which is made into roghan (liquid butter) and sold throughout the country. The peculiar privileges of the Iliyats consist in liberty to range over districts from which no one can dispossess them. They ascend in the summer to cold regions called Ilaks, where they find pasture, and in the winter keep to their Kishlak tracts, which enjoy a warmer climate. These ilaks and Kishlaks are defined to each tribe by the Government, and, whenever their limits are encroached upon by unprivileged tribes, violent strifes and battles ensue. “ The existence of these migratory tribes being advantageous to the Government, they are little oppressed. They are taxed at certain es tablished rates upon each bead of cattle, and are called upon to serve in the King's armies. When they cultivate ground, they are fined according to the rates exacted from the other Rayahs. The horsemen's pay is about 8 tomans annually, for which he serves six months in the field; the other six months he remains at home. The tufangchi, or foot soldier, gets 7 tomans per annum, and half the year remains at home. The wages are paid into the hands of the Khan of the tribe, who delivers over the money to the subaltern officers, called Sultans, who pay the soldiers. This promotes peculation; the Khan subtracting his share, the Mirza or scribe his, and the subalterns theirs ; while the poor soldier deems himself very lucky it he gets one-half of that which is his due. u The Iliyats are not compelled to bestow their labour upon public works like the other Rayahs; they keep exclusively to their tents and tend their cattle. The taxes they pay are levied by their chiefs, who account with the Government. Those’who are inclined to elude taxation, frequently do so by secreting their cattle in the mountains. “In their different small communities, they are governed by Rish- sefids (literally “ white beards') or elders, who have no other emblem of power or superiority than a white beard. Old age is extremely respected by them, and generally by all Persians ; and is indulged with great liberties. A Rish sefid, a poor miserable old man will not fail, whenever his tribe is oppressed, to make a journey purposely to remons trate With the Governor of the province, and abuse him to bis face; and so careful are the Governors not to offend these influential persons that they bear their reproof with moderation, and are fain to be civil. Their disputes are decided by their Risk*sefids; ever the ordinances of their102 Hakims, or Governors, are referred to them. In all eases of marriage the elder is first consulted, and his consent procured as a preliminary. The tribes seldem intermarry. The elders recommend the families whose daughters may be selected for wives; but, whenever one tribe refuses to give their daughters in marriage to another, it is esteemed aa affront and a motive for strife. “ The Persian Government is ever jealous of the migration of these tribes, and they cannot remove from one province to another, without first having obtained the Shah's permission. “ In times of trouble, such as the death of the King, frequently, if they be strong enough to encounter opposition, they pass from their old haunts to better places. “We have said before that the possessions of the Iliyats consist of cattle. These are camels, horses, mares, cows, oxen, mules, asses, sheep and goats, beside a fine race of dogs. Their pastures, although open to the Shah, the Princes, and other great men of the country, may also be said to be their property, inasmuch as they have liberty to rano'e over them, unless there has been issued a “Kuruk” or prohibition. “ Their property, if it maybe so called, consists of tents, carpets, bed- ding, cooking utensils, large cauldrons in which they boil the rogham or preserved butter, skins to shake butter and sour milk in, and all the rude furniture of shepherds. Much of their furniture consists of camel pack- saddles, ornamented bridles for the chief camel, besides other ornaments in beads, &amp;c. “ Then there are saddles for horses and palans for mules, and a sort of padded cushion for the back of their tents. “Anlliyatof middling fortune possesses about a hundred sheep, three or four camels, three or four mares, ten asses, etc. A man who possesses a thousand sheep, thirty camels, twenty mares, etc., is reckoned a rich man. “ The revenue of such a property is derived from the wool and milk of sheep, the wool and hire of camels, the colts from the mares and asses • the female camel brings forth every two years, the mare every year, and the sheep once a year. In some parts of Persia, particularly among the Kurds who enjoy the finest pasturage, the ewes produce twice a year. “The patrimony of an Hiyat is divided among his children, according to the Mussulman law : two-thirds to the sons, and one-third to the daughters • the latter taking the clothes and valuables belonging to the mother. S ' ’ “The value of an Hiyat tent is about 6 to 7 tomans. It is made of goats' hair, consisting of cloths of about a foot and a quarter in width, woven bv the women. All the members of a family—man, women, and children— are usually employed spinning goats' hair, which is either in actual use in the loom or laid by for sale. They weave the cloth m a portable loom, which they fix in the rudest manner possible, but which answers all the purposes for which it is intended. This cloth is of strong texture, impervious to rain, and will last twenty years. The covering of one of the tents is generally about 40 feet in length and103 twenty in breadth, and is erected upon a range of poles, being fastened to the ground with pegs. The tents are extremely rude, and do not show any appearance or attention to comfort. In Azerbaijan, and the more northern and consequently raiuy countries, they have another sort of tent which has been borrowed from the Turkomans. This consists of ribs united, and, when open, is like a cage on which thick felts are thrown, it being entered by a narrow door : it is called ‘ alajeh ^ the goats’ hair tents are called ‘ kara-chadar, or black tent. “ The encampments of the Iliyats are generally of about twenty to thirty tents together, which they pitch mostly without any great attention to regularity. They are also to he seen in a circle, as well as in line, and appear conspicuous on a light soil owing to their black colour; on a dark soil they are scarcely perceptible, particularly under the shadow of a mountain. The tents are close to each other, but the different encampments may be a mile or two .apart, according to the convenience of grass and water. « The Iliyats feed principally on the produce of their flocks, and eat sour milk, cheese, dough or buttermilk, and much roghan or preserved butter. Their annual expenses are much less than those of the inhabitants of cities ; for, excepting their clothes, copper utensils, pack-sa&lt;hlles, and ornamented luxuries, they supply all their own necessities. Their simple manner of living (not to mention their being out of the way of extortion) may be calculated at one hundred per cent, cheaper than in the town. They make their own tents or dwelling places, weave their own carpets and hammocks of felt, cut their own wood and bum their own charcoal; they kill their own meat, make their cheese and butter, and their lives are far more free from disease and local complaints. Their dress does not differ from that of other Persians, except in its extreme meanness. A man, rich in cattle, will appear with a coat to his hack that scarcely holds together, and in very indifferent dresses, with no other covering over their heads than their tents ; their women and children brave all the rigour of winter. The favour* ite wife or child enjoys whatever luxury of dress belongs to the tribe, consisting of gold bracelets, necklaces, silver, and gold ornament's foi the hair; frequently a handkerchief is edged with perforated silver coin, and bandeaus of the same are tied about; the Head and neck. It is not ^uncom mon to meet with ancient medals suspended about the neck and Heads of the Iliyat women and children. “ The time of the Iliyat’s rest is the winter, when his flocks are not productive and require no other care than being led to pasture. Ihe men then help the women to weave carpers and tent cloths, ojc spin goars hair. At the approach of spring all is then tull of activity : the ewes biing foith, then the lambs are tended, then shearing comes on, the flocks require constant milking, and the numerous uses to which the milk is consigned, such as for butter, dough, and roghan require much work, which die men per form. The women, too, are very laborious; they pitch and unpitc encampments when on the march ; load and unload^ the beasts of burden , attend the children and the young animals; they sit down in companies to spin, and help to churn and make sour milk. The drudgery is tor the business of women; protection, purchase, and sale, and all the grea er interests of the community for the males.104 The Iliyats break up tbeir winter encampments one month after the festival or the Nanruz, ^ one month after the sun has entered the sio*n ^Aries’, and travel by easy journeys of 2 to 3 miles each day to what they call the 4 Sardiadd % or the boundary between the cold and hot regions ; there they stay for about a month, and then travel on again to their Ilak, where they encamp during the heat of summer, and where they remain about seventy days; they then return to the f sar-haddwhere they remain another month, and at length reach their old haunts in the Kishlak for the winter. Many direct their motions by the rising of the stars, and many by the appearance of the snowy mountains. They are unmolested in their passage, and, perhaps, may give a sheep or so to the lords of the villages near which they travel* The ground upon which they encamp is improved by their presence, since it is strengthened by the manure they leave. “ Their mode of calculating property is by sbeep; they pay their shepherds in sheep. In their own dealings, in their purchase of oxen,etc., they pay in sheep. A man killing one of their dogs is liable to be fined 4 sheep. Among the villages, too, in their smaller dealings, the Persian Rayah deals with his neighbour, not in money but in kind—corn, wool, straw, etc. Three months after the Nauruz they separate the rams from the ewes, and feed them till they are‘ must \ At the beginning of the sign Mizan, or Libra, they turn them into the flock, by which the ewes bear at about the Nauruz, and some of the Iliyats celebrate this event by music, son^s, and merry-making. Shearing takes place twice in tbe year; the first time after the Nauruz, about the 20th of May; and the second at the Mizan.^ They give, of their wool and other produce of their flocks, which is called by the general name of ‘kashf/ to the poor in alms. At the time of the new lambs they take portions of their milk, which they make into curds, cream, haimak, and fresh cheese ; and send it to their friends as a complimentary gift, marking the return of the season. A shepherd has care of three hundred sheep, and is paid in kind, both in wool and lambs. “From what has been said, it is evident that the Iliyats, as raw material for the formation of troops, must be of considerable consequence to the state of which they are the subjects. They are soldiers by nature, as far as the mere habit of the man goes, but it must be added, they are difficult of discipline owing to their clan-like propensities. Those on the frontier frequently give rise to feuds and war. “ One of the great sources of bickering, between the Turks and Persians, are the Kurds on the frontier, who migrate from the one State to the other as best suits their humour and interest. Good legislation would, no doubt, soon turn tbem into peaceable and industrious communities; but as tbe eastern G overnments are at present constituted the vast regions inhabited by these wanderers must continue mere tracts of waste, adapted solely to the uses of armed shepherds and lawless freebooters. (Morier). “ Tbe system of Government, pursued in these tribes, is the same throughout the whole of the tribes of Persia. Each tribe has its chief, who exercises an unlimited authority over its members. c( The tushmal are merely chiefs of families or of subdivisions, who are employed in collecting the tribute, and are considered responsible to the chief for the good order and allegiance of those placed under their care.They may resort to any means they think proper in raising this tribute, and may imprison, and even put to death those who belong to the division over which they are placed; but they are accountable to the great chief for that part of the tribute apportioned to their division, and must follow him in his wars when he needs their services. It is upon these conditions that they hold their power as tushmals; and, if these are neglected, they may be immediately displaced. The constitution of these tribes bears, in fact, a very strong resemblance to feudalism. The chief himself accounts with the Government, and is left to raise the tribute through his tushmals. “ Their women, and the Lur women generally, weave carpets and yarn ; the latter of both sheep and goats' hair; goats' hair is used in the manu facture of their tents (also the work of women), which are generally of a black colour. They are readily pitched, struck and packed ; and so arranged in strips and lengths as to be carried by their cows, which are of a small size and are sure footed hill climbers. These tents are of all sizes; they are high (8 ft. to 10 ft. in the centre) and long tentes d’abri, their length depending on the number of poles, generally placed at a distance of 10 ft. to ft. apart. The sides and ends are walled in by wicker work (chik), made of reeds; by reed screens, the long blanket shed is partitioned off into any number of apartments desired; as a rule each wife, if a man has several, provides herself with a tent, carpets etc., etc. These tents are poor winter residences; the wind blows through them; the rain pours through them, and, except in fair sunny weather, their inhabitants have no very pleasant time of it.' {Gazetteer of 1885.)

Being on the Kermanshah-Kurdistan frontier, they claim the protection sometimes of the Governor of Kermanshab, and sometimes that of Kurdistan ; but, obey none of them. They profit by the rivalry, existing between these Governors, to continue a life of robbery and depredation. The neighbouring tribes, however, specially those on the Kurdistan side, are getting tired of their excess; and render their existence more and more precarious. The Jaffis are Sunnis and fanatical. Fatta Beg has 130 horsemen always ready to march. These Jaffs are on bad terms with the Turkish [Cesari, 1^04.) They are very courageous ; and this is what Mr. C. B. Rosenplaenter of the D'Arcy Concession wrote, from Camp Chia Surkh, in March 1904:— c&lt; Fatta Beg of Kurdistan has jnst given Ihe Quran Sultans a fearful licking. He had only 50 sowars, mostly of his own family, with him. He attacked the Guran Sultans, Jemshid Sultan, Javan Beg Sultan, Hajoi Murad, Saffar Khan Sultan and Kader Aga and Said Ali Beg Sultan (Persian Jaff) ; all told about 300 sowars and 400 piadehs with rifies, and scattered them all over the country. Jemshid Sultan lost his two Mauser carbines, tbe brother of Javan Beg Sultan was wounded, Said Ali Beg the same. Ten Gurans were killed outright, and no end of rifles and am munition captured, as tbe piadebs threw away their guns.

A large district of the province of Kermanshah, inhabited by the Kalhor tribe. It is contiguous to the districts of Mahidasht, Guran, Kerind, Zohab and Eivan, and to the Khanekin and Mendaii districts of Turkey.^ The chief place is Harunabad, on the main road from Mahidasht to Kerind. The Governor of the district is at present Daoud Khan, Saham-ul* Mamalek, who is also chief of the Kalhor tribe/ The Deh-Nishin and Sahra Nishins are all Kalhors. This district has extensive valleys and pas ture lands; and would, if properly cultivated, produce very large crops. In the hands of nomad tribes the cultivation is neglected. The Kalhor district is however sufficiently productive, with the little care given to culti vation, to produce enough to meet the wants of the whole of the Kalb or tribe and of their cattle.118 li Kas n r-Shijf. eXtend fr ° m tLe nei S^&lt;^ood of ^at town to the borders Their landed property, yeilaks and kesblaks, is very fertile and produe- tive, and they possess enormous stretches of “ abi lend. AmonJt some of their landed property is the plain of Gilan, which measures^ hv P, farsakhs, and is watered by 60 irrigation canals, the plain of Kalleh Shahin, e,st of the Paikuli range, lying between that range and that of Dukkan-i- Daoud These lands were purchased by the Kalhor chiefs from their Tuikish proprietors about the beginning of the century before last. (Kalleh uhahin was included in tne territory of the Kurdish chief of Dartang and Darnah who at the time of the treaty of 1639, in the reign of Murad IV of Turkey and Shah Saffi of Persia, ruled over Zohab and the whole of the adjoining mountains.) Some others of their possessions are Direh, Shian, Kifrawur, Chelleh, the plain of Rawand, Shahine and Shaun, Mandrik Kamarzard, etc , and a portion of the great plain of Mahidasht. The tribe’ is said to possess m all some 200 villages and hamlets, belonging to the Hajjizadeh and Mohammed Ah Khani clans. &amp; The Mohammed Ali Khani clan sold all its property to the late Haiii Aga Hassan British Agent, the father of the present British Agent of Kermanshan (now deceased). &amp; . ^ a jjizadeh or Shahbazis whose ancestors, turned all their property into wakis m favour of their descendants, (the property being consequently unsaleable) are still landed proprietors. The Kalhors are Shiahs, The land occupied by the Kalhors is Milkyat.

Kucbimi and Kolajubi Kuleppah Charzebari ... Bedagbbeghi and Alawandi ... ... The Kalhor regiment has no band. Mr. T. C. Plowden, in 1881, gave the following interesting details on the history of the Shahbazi clan : “ The Shabazi clan chum. t° have migrated, in the remote past, from Isfahan (Lieutenant-General McGregor believes that the Kalhors have dwelt on the mountains of Zagros, overlooking Zohab and Soleimanieh, from a very early antiquity) to their present abode. Muhammed Ali Khan chief of the Kalhors, died about 40years ago (i. e. about 1840), leaving three sons, Mohammed Hussem, Mohammed Hassan and Zaiu-ul-Abedin. The eldest succeeded bis father, but after a time resigned his chiefship, which then devolved upon his second brother. Mohammed Hassan Khan Zain- ul-Abedm, the youngest brother, bribed the authorities and procured his brother s imprisonment for two years at Kermanshah, and his subsequent removal to Teheran. Zam-ul-Abedin held the chiefship for 2* years, and119 established a character as a determined but harsh and tyrannical ruler. He quarrelled with his son Reza Gull Khan, whom he turned out of his tents, and left to support himself as best he could. Eventually Zain-ul- Abedin and some of his principal adherents were taken by surprise and slain in the pass of Ismail Beg, near Harunabad, in revenge for the murder of Asad Beg, a leading member of the tribe. When this happened Emad- ed-Dowleh was Governor of Kermanshah. He recalled Mohammed Hassan Khan from Teheran and reappointed him Hakim of the Kalhors. Mohammed Hassan Khan retained the Governorship for many years, until his nephew, Reza Guli Khan, who had in the meantime grown up, seized the opportunity of 'B change of Governors of Kermanshah to secure his uncle's deposition and his own appointment as Hakim of the Kalhors. This happened about six or seven years ago {i.e. 1874), and, notwithstanding the frequent changes in the Governorship of Kermanshah which have since occurred, Reza Guli Khan managed to retain his position until the spring of the present year (1881), when, in consequence of his failure to deal effectually with the Ahmadavands, he was removed, and his uncle, Moham med Hassan Khan, was once more summoned from Teheran, and reinstated provisionally in his old position.' W r hen Mr. Plowden passed through Sar-i-pol-i'Zohab, he found Mohammed Hassan encamped under the bridge over the Holvan, with a small body of Sinjabi and Kalhor horse. A few days later Mohammed Hassan called on him at his camp at Pa-i- Tak. He is liked by his people, who find him comparatively a mild and easy ruler. Mr. Plowden did not see Reza Guli Khan, who was at Chebi within easy reach of the frontier, in case circumstances should render it advisable for him to take refuge in Ottoman territory; he is a young man of about 30 years of age, more capable and of more vigorous character than his uncle. During the six years of his Governorship, his rule was severe and probably cruel, but he kept his people in order. He is a Chador- Mishin, and all his four wives are of Kurdish stock—two circumstances which go far to secure his popularity with the tribe, and, as a matter of fact, notwithstanding’ his recent removal from office, two-thirds of the Kalhors are reckoned as his adherents. (Plowdeu, 1881.) Mohammed Hassan Khan was replaced once more by bis nephew, Reza Guli Khan, who, under the Deputy-Governorship of Hussein Khan Hessam- ul-Mulk, was sent to Isfahan (the province of Kermanshah forming at that time, 1885, part of the'large Governorship of Zil-es-Sultan). From Isfahan Zil-es-Sultan had him sent to Teheran, where he was imprisoned, and where he died. Mohammed Ali Khan, bis brother, who had shared his captivity, escaped from Teheran at his brother’s death and joined bis tribes men, who declared that they would recognise no other chief than him. Farukh Khan, who had been appointed Hakim of the Kalhors by the Governor of Kermanshah, was expelled, and Mohammed Ali Khan, since known as Mohammed Ali Khan Ilkhani, assumed the ehiefship of the tribe and the title of Hakim of the Kalhors. He was soon confirmed in that appointment by the authorities in Teheran, and ruled over his tribe up till the month of August 190&amp;, when he was replaced by Daoud Khan Khaleddi, Saham ul Mamalek. The following is what I was told by a friend of mine of the Shabbazi clan : &lt;c Some 173 years ago, one evening, a certain Manucher Khan, chief of a few Kalhor families, was in his tent, when he was awakened by the sound [CmQMGIB]120 of footsteps. Going* out of Ms tent fie met 12 visitors, wto asked birn to put them ui» for tHe night. JYfanucH&amp;r Khan, who was a charitable man, crave them his tent and had a sheep killed ; and entertained them as best he could, considering his limited means. Next day the 12 travellers departed, invoking the benediction of God on their k nd host and oh his posterity* Nobody has ever doubted that the visitors were the 1~ Imams, and the prosperity of the Hajjizadeh clan dates from that evening. Manucher Khan had seven sons who all went on a pilgrimage to Mecca; hence their descendants were named Hajjizadeha. One of the seven si ns was named Shabbcz Khan, and his family is known as tlm Shahbazis.” Of: the father and ancestors of Manuoher Khan nothing is known, and my informant failed to s,e where Mr. T. C. PloWdetf fohnd that they come from Isfahan. , ~ .-*11 i ^ tv- ' r ;; ^ 'f ; L t\ o* fe jT.f ; .-y Vi ■- * * .« History of the Kalhor chiefs as related by Fathullah K.ban son of Moay- yed ul Vezareh Kalbor : “ Harun and his brother, two dancers, were on their way from Shiraz to Kerb el a where they were going on a pilgrimage. At Sharafabad they were retained by the Governor of the place, who kept them to dance at his place. They remained in Sharafabad and married in the village. With the help of the Governor they were allowed and enabled to become rayyats of the place. The Governor having in a period of trouble been dep* sed, the two brothers were chosen as chiefs by the villagers. They ; went to KermanshuK and Harun was named Katkhoda of the- village, which then changed its name from Sharafabad to Harunabad. M hammed Ali Khan, son of Harun, married the sister of Hajji Shahbaz Khan (Chief of the clan) and, with the help of his wife's family, became Governor of the Kalhors. His son, by the above-mentioned lady, Mehdi Khan, succeeded bis father as chief of the Kalhors, but the two sons of Hajji Shahbaz Khan, Mustafa Guli Khan and Abbas Guli Khan, claimed the chief ship of the tribe from Moheb Ali Khan Makui, Governor of Kermanshah; and, after spending cons derable sums in presents, etc., Abbas Guli Khan was named Sarbang (Colonel) of the Kalhor regiment, and Mehdi Khan remained chief of the Kalhors. Alehdi Khan died leaving three sons, Muhammed Hussein Khan, Zein-ul- Ahedin Khan and Mohammed Hassan Khan, Mohammed Hussein Khan was named Governor, but was deposed on account of his incapacity. He was^ succeeded by his brother, Zein-ul-Abedin Khan, who married the sister of Emad ed Dowleh and, by the help of his brother-in-law, managed to retain during 8 years the chiefship of his tribe. He was surprised and killed at Tang-Ismail Beg by Asad Khan, the grandfather of the present Daoud Khan Ilkbani, who had rebelled. (l?th Ramazan). Mohammed Hassan Khan, who was then in the capital, was recalled from Teheran by Emad ed Howleh, who gave him in marriage his sister, Mariam Sultan Khanum, the widow of the late chief. Mohammed Hassan Khan was replaced by Mustafa Guli Khan, who, however, had to return the chiefship to Mohammed Hassan Khan. Mohammed Hassan Khan was, however, again replaced by his opponent ; and, at the death of Mustafa Guli Khan, Feza Guli Khan, son of Zein ul Abedin, was, through the efforts of the Hajiizadeh clan, named chief of the tribe.121 V Mohammed Hassan Khan died and, through the intervention of Aga Hassan Yekil ed Dowleh, Mohammed Kazem Khan of the Hajjizadeh clan and son-in-law of Mohammed Hassan Khan, was named Governor. Reza Guli Khan and Mohammed Ali Khan were sent in chains to Isfahan, and thence to Teheran by Hessam ul Mulk. Mohammed Kazem Khan died after having been for eight years Gover nor. He was succeeded by his son, Mohammed Khan, who only retained for one year the Chief ship of the tribe. Farukh named Governor and had, at the head of his troops, to bring Mohammed Khan his nephew to order. Reza Guli Khan died of cholera in Teheran : his brother Mohammed Ali Khan escaped, and on foot he managed to rejoin his tribe. The Kalhofs separated in two parts, half of them supporting Farukh Khan and the other Mohammed Ali Khan. Mohammed Khan, on hearing of the return of Mohammed Ali Khan, ran away with a few sowars and joined the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh. In order to enforce order again amongst the tribesmen, the Amir T^izam, then Governor of Kermanshah, ordered all the Kalhor chiefs to Kermanshah and put them in prison. Mariam Sultan Khanum, having it is said borrowed 9,000 tomans from Aga Hassan Yekil ed Dowleh, bought the Governorship for her husband. Be retained “the chieftainship for three years, but Farukh Khan and Moham med Khan being reconciled made large cash presents to the Governor ; the former ^ot named chief of the Kallvr regiment, ana the latter chief of the tribe. Moharptned Ali Khan was imprisoned. •The Kalhors, on hearing of the imprisonment of thnir chief, came to Kermanshah and declared that they would accept as chief neither Moham med Khan nor Farnkh Khan, but only Mohammed Ali Khan. ^ Mohammed Ali Khan was then sent to Kurdistan to prison, and Amir Nizam named his own man Ali Ashraf Khan, chief of the Kalhors. Hessam ul Mulk, on replacing Amir Nizam as Governor of Kermanshah, recalled Mohammed Ali Khan from Kurdistan and renamed him chief of the tribe. Farukh Khan and his sons, at the news of the nomination of Mohammed Ali Khan, rebelled and took refuse in the territory of Hussein Gull K ban Yali, till tbe time wben Egbal ed Dowleb sent Mobammed Ali Khan wrj 1 the Sinjabi, Guran and Ahmadavand Behtui sowars to force part or t e tribe to come to town. Daoud Khan, who commanded the al iors w o refused to obey the Governor of Kermanshah s orders, sent foi aru r an and got reconciled to him, and a^ked Egbal ed Dowleh to name aru T i Khan chief of the tribe. Egbal ed Dowleh kaving refused, aou an and Faruk Khan, with more than half the Kalhor tribe, crossed thelrontier and went to Mendali in Turkish territory. Pressed by the people of Kermanshah, whose cattle is in the the Kalhors, the Governor sent Moayyed ed Dowleh and a coo * brother of Farukh Khan, to Mendeli to induce Daoud Khan an am122 Khan to return to Persian territory. He also promised to name Farukh Khaa Governor of the Kalhor tribe. On the return of Daoud Khan and Farukh Khan to Persian territory, Farukh Khan and the son of Daoud Khan were ordered to Kermanshah. Farukh Khan was not named chief of the Kalhors, but Lgbal ed Dowleh managed a reconciliation between Daoud Khan and Mohammed Ali Khan Ilkhani. Displeased with Mohammed Ali Khan, Egbal ed Dowleh replaced him two months later by Farukh Khan. Mohammed Ali Khan joined Hussein Guli Khan, Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, but, on receiving assurances as to his safety from the Governor of Kermanshah, he returned to town and was shortly afterwards once more named chief of the Kalhors. He remained chief of the Kalhor tribe until deposed by Ala ed Dowleh (in 1902), who re placed him by Daoud Khan Khaleddi. The as! of the malyat paid by the Kalhor tribe is Krs. 6,142*500 dinars cash, but in the year 1307, i.e., 13 years ago, the asl and farh amounted already to Krs. 95,897 269 dinars, whilst, I believe, the amount at present paid to be about, if not slightly over, 12 5 000 Tomans.” Notes on the origin of the Kalhors by Sir FI. Kawlinson : “ If the Samaritan captives can be supposed to have retained to the present day any distinct individuality of character, perhaps the Kalhor tribe has the best claim to be regarded as their descendants. The Kalhors, who are believed to have inhabited from the remotest antiquity these regions around Mount Zagros, preserve in their name the title of Calah They state themselves to be descended from Roham or Nebuchadnezzar, the con queror of the Jews; perhaps an obscure tradition of their real origin. They have many Jewish names among them, and above all their general physiog nomy is strongly indicative of an Israelitish descent. The Iliyat of this tribe now mostly profess Mohammedanism, but a part of them, together with the Gurans who acknowledge to be an offset of the Kalhors and most of the other tribes of the neighbourhood, are still of the Aliullahi persuasion : a faith which bears evident marks of Judaism, singularly amalgamated with Sabean, Christian and Mohammedan legends,” lr124 Note.—T he sub-divisions are further divided into small groups of families, the mention of which would be superfluous.“ This tribe, which is reckoned the most powerful on the frontier, is com posed of ten distinct tribes on bad terms with each other, and on y agreeing in their hatred of the present Ilkhani, Daoud Khan, Saham-ul-Mamalek. He was a small salt merchant who, by dint o£ cunning and, it must be admitted, of crimes, has managed to obtain the supreme position amongs his tribe. He was for some time Naib of Mohammed All Khan, the ex-Ilkham, and managed to have his master expelled and to replace him. Confirmed in his appointment by Ala ed Dowleh, to wnom he is said to have paid considerable sums of money, Daoud Khan set immediately to revenge himself of his old enemies and to rebuild his fortune, bhe^ short uime m took to accomplish his aim has vowed him to the execration or all the inhabitants of Kalhor, but the terror he inspires keeps them quiet. Ali Akbar Khan, Chief of the Siah Siah, who had in some way opposed Daoud Khan, was invited to Harunabad by Daoud Khan, who sent him as safeguard a Koran which he had sealed. Whilst engaged in riendly con versation with Daoud Khan, he was shot from behind by Jawan Mir, the latter’s son, . Daoud Khan has married the widow of his own sen Javan Mir, a daughter of Ali Akbar Khan. In order to multiply his family connections Daoud Khan has already married Id wives, one of them being the daughter of Mansur-ul-Mulk, whom he married in the spring of 1903. But the relations existing between Daoud Khan and bis son make one foresee an imminent drama, even more frightful that that of the Atridae. The Kolhar tribe numbers more than 8,000 tents and can raise 3,000 horsemen, but these are not under the Ilkhani and prefer keeping as much as possible to their hereditary chiefs. Their summer campments extend from the bridge of Mahidasht to Harunabad, chief place of Daoud Khan. Their winter quarters extend from Gilan to Saumar, which latter plain is inhabited by the tribe of Eivan, also under the authority of Daoud Khan.”— (Oesari, 1904.) KALIAN—Bala-Darband.

KALLEH-SAM— Between the district of Huleilan and that of Chahar Docol are the ruins of a Sassanian fort, perchod on the summit of a rock ; and probably intended to defend the passes which separate Huleilan from Zeish, and to protect the town of Zeish from attacks from the north. KALLEH SAUMAR ou SOMBAR or SAGMAR, Eivan— In the plain of that name. It is now a ruin. The plain of Saumar is still in dispute between Persia and Turkey. In January 1903, Mr Cesari of tbe Persian Customs was instructed to build a Customs' observa tion post here, but the Turks said they would prevent, by force if neces«arv any building being erected on the disputed ground. ' U KALLEK-SHAH-GODAR or SHAH-GOZAR—Zohab. “A small building in Kermanshah, an hour's march from Kasr-i-Shirin towards Sar-i-pol-i Zohah, on tbe Khanikin-Kermanshah road This marks one of the halting places of the Shah, on the occasion of his visit tc Kerbela.'— {Plowdtn.) u Nasr-ed-Dm Shah remained at Kasr-i-Shirin, as can be seen from / al!e k S , hall ^odar takes its name from the ford, know! as Shah-Godar which affords a way across the Ho]van.

Ala-ed-Dowleh, in order to afford more133 protection to caravans and pilgrims, transplanted a certain number of families to spots which were named Mozafferabad, ISlasirabad, Ahmadabad and Husseinabad. The villagers were exempted from all taxes. These numerous villages along the road afford protection to caravans ; as help is close at hand, and robbers can easily be traced if they pass by any of the villages. These villages are made of reed huts, and a village is often removed a mile or two distant from its old site, thus making the drawum-- up of maps very difficult indeed. 60 inhabitants. Cultivation: rice.”— (Post-Master, SaripoL) KALLEH-SHAHIN—Kalhor. Belonging to the Hajji-Zadehs. Malyat Krans 1,629-54.9 dinars cash. A small ruined fort on the Paikala range, in the district of Kalhor, whence is the name of an extensive plain, lying between the above ranoeand that of Dukkan-i-Daud. This was purchased by the Kalhor chiefs from their Turkish proprietors, about the beginningof last century.— (Rawlinson and Plowden.) It is 6 farsakhs long by 2-3rds farsakhs wide. The cultivation is grain and rice, of which about 2,000 kharvars grain and 1,000 kharvars rice is said, by the Kalhors, to be produced at Kalleh Shahin and in its dependencies. 500 Tomans cash is paid yearly by the royyahs to the landowners. Rawlinson says : tl Kalleh Shahin, immediately contiguous to the old city of Hoi van, was unquestionably included in the territory of the Kurdish prince of Darhand and Darnah, who, at the time of the treaty of 1639 in the reign of Murad IV of Turkey and Shah Suffi of Persia, or at any rate shortly before it, ruled over Zohab and the whole of the adjoining moun tains. The lands of Kalleh-Shahin indeed were only purchased by the Kalhor chief from the Turkish proprietors, about 40 years ago; and, 1 have always heard in this country, the right of Persia to Gilan as placed in pre cisely the same category with her claims upon the pashalik of Zohab.” KALLEH-SHAH-KHANI—Bala-Darband.

At the north-east angle, where the scarp rises m a rocky ridge to its highest point and joins the mountain of Daiahu, theie is a pass which conducts into the fort, the ascent rising gradually from the shoulder: the whole way from the town of Zohab is easy enough, but the descent, on the other side into the tableland of the fort, is by a mosu precipi tous and difficult gorge. A wall has been thrown across the jaws ot the pass; towers have been erected on either side to support it; and, somewhat lower down the defile, where the jutting rocks nearly meet, two strong castles have been built opposite each other, which command the narrow entrance and render it quite secure against attack. Altogether, this fortress may he considered to have been perfectly impregnable in an age when artillery was unknown/*— (Rawlinson,) The description given by Dr. Mann of what he saw does not tally with General Rawlinson's account. This is what Dr. O. Mann says: “ Kalleh-i- Yezdijird; near Zardeh, and overhanging that village, are the ruins of a&lt; Sassanian castle known as Kalleh-i-Yezdijird, It is situated at the summit of a precipitous rock, commanding the entrance of the Tang-i-Baba-Yadgar, which leads from Zardeh to Baba-Yadgar, 2 miles distant. The Tang-i-Baba-Yadgar is reached by the Milleh Shater on the one side, and by the Milleh Khat Kharmanan on the other. The castle, which I visited, is only accessible from one side by a very tor tuous road. There are large rooms, very likely cellars, with ' ver y thick wallsand arclies of doors or windows still erect; very strongly built of stone and planter. The total superficy of the enclosed area is about 100 square yards. This castle commanded the town, called by natives Shahr-i-Yazdijird ; extensive ruins of which are still to be seen. I completely fail to identify the castle I visited with any of the two mentioned in Rawlinson’s description.” KALLEH ZANJIR—Guran.

Chief place of the District of Kangavar : Latitude 34° 29' 24 // N. Elevation 6,020 feet. Dr. O. Mann reckoned the elevation at 1642*40 metres. Kangavar is on the road from Hamadan to Kermanshah, 55 miles from Kermanshah, east by north. It is built on a series of natural and artificial mounts, and is remarkable for the ruins of a temple, probably the temple of Anaitis. There is here a telegraph office, a post office and a relay of 6 horses for the postal service. In 1873, Kangavar had a population of 1,000 left out of 2,500 which it had before the famine. The population at present can safely be put at 1,800 houses. Kangavar is divided in 7 quarters: Gachkan, Dahaneh Bazaar, Sar- Musala, Varmeziari, Sarajub, Shahrabad, Pusht-i-Imamzadeh. There is a quarry close by, named Shelmarran, in whhdi three unfinished columns are still to be seen, and whence the columns of the temple of Anaitjs were brought. a Kangavar is an important village, as it is on the eastern end of the Bisutun gap. From here the roads from Hamidanand the road from Daulat- abad and Kom meet. Seems a prosperous village, with good mud houses ; The Hakim’s is an imposing building.'”—(7/ J.

Kangavar is called by the ancient Arab writers “ Kasr al Lossus.'” C Rawlinson gives it as the site of the ancient Coneobar, which was in the neighbourhood of Adrapan, on the road leading to Baghistnn. He also thinks it might be the Chavon of Diodorus where, according to the Sicilian historian, Semiramis built a palace and laid out a paradise. Here* in the time of Isidore, was a famous temple of Artemis; probably a temple of Anaitis, whose worship was widespread in Media, Susiana and Cappadocia. Kiev. 5,740 ft.

KARASU— A river, which, rising in the north of the Kermanshah district at a place calkd Rowansar, flows between Kermanshah and Bisutun with a southerly course, and is joined at a spot about 15 miles east-south-east of Kermanshah by the Gamasiab. The united rivers then flow south -west through Chama-Miza, Gudapar, Tang-i-Tir, and Huleilan to Simera, where they join and help to make the main stream of the Karkhah. (Plowden.) Ihe Karasu passes at about 3 miles of Kermanshah. Although the Karasu flows across the plain of Karmanshah, its water is not used for irrigati on. The levels aie not very favourable, and although irrigation works could easily be made, water is so easily got from the mountains t 'at nobody has yet been found to attempt any irrigation works.

At this celebrated spot, Bisutun, the Gamasiab receives the Ab-i-Dinavar coming from the north, and again* after a couise of about miles nearly soutb-west, another stream called theKarasu, passes through Kermanshah at about 20 miles north-uorth- west of that place. r lhe direction of the main trunk is nearly south, until it receives, at a few miles from thence, a tributary coming from the Guran mountains by a westerly course, and passing by the tomb of Baba Buzurg. Below this junction, under the name of Karasu,it runs south by west for nearly 60 miles, traversing the Kuhi Turdulan and plain of Tihran, in the district of Pish Kuh ; and, finally, through the great chain of the Zagros to the ruins of Sliahri Budbar, which are situated at its confluence with the river of Kerind. This is a very considerable stream, which rises close to the gates of Zagros, and has a tortuous course of nearly 100 miles in a general south-east direction. In the latter part of its course it forces its way through the Zagros, by a tremendous gorge,into the plain of Zangavan, being then at a distance of about 12 miles east of the ruins of Shirvan. From thence it takes the name of Ab-i-Shirvan, as it passes in a south- south-east direction through the valley of Rudbar, being increased almost at the junction by the Zangawan, the Ab-i-Shirwan, and two other streams, all of which come from the west. The united waters of Karasu and Ab-i-Shirwan, now called the Kark- hah, follow the Zagros in a south-south-east direction for about 80 miles, through the plains of Lurfc aud Saimarah, and one mile above the bridge. The Karkbah is joined on the north-east side by the Kashghan, a large stream which rises in two branches on the Kuh-i-Chehel Nabalighan, at some distance beyond Khorremabad, in the plain of Kuhdasht, and, after being joined by the united streams of Khorremabad, Kayun, and Tayin, the main trunk runs south-westward, through the plain of Jadar and over a number of precipices, forming a succession of magnificent cataracts, as it struggles through the outer rampart of the Zagros into the valley of the Karkhah, some thousand feet below the hills. At about 221 miles south-east of the bridge of Gamashan, the Karkhah receives the Ab-i- Garm, a smaller stream coming from the north ; and at about 38J miles south-east from thence is Pul-i-Tang, a very remarkable bridge over a chasm, which is here 150 feet deep, and so narrow that a Kurd actually leaped across it, in the presence of Major Rawlinson. Having overcome this obstacle, the river resumes its ordinary size ; and 8 miles lower it is joined by the Ab-i-Zal, which enters it, after a course of about 50 miles from its source, in the fastnesses of the Kal-i-Aspid and Anarahrud. The Karkhah leaves the mountains west of Dizful, within 10 miles of that river. At this spot it is a rapid mountain stream, aud at its entrance into the plain, it was formerly crossed by a bridge, the remains of which are Pol Pai. Immediately below this bridge the river is fordable during summer ; this ford being generally used by horsemen. It is, however, difficult owing to the rapidity of the current.Their united streams now quit the direction of Duful, and take a more southerly course, for about 40 miles, to the rums °f Iwa “ l Karkhah. At Iwani Karkhah, the river divides itself mto four branches and is easily fordable in summer and autumn. A little south of this spot ,where theie are the remains of a bridge, and a mile and a half from the celebrated ruins of Sus, the Karkhah bends a little west of south, and continues in this direction through the rich plain of Khuzistan passing through the extensive marshes which surround Hawizah; from thence it winds south west and falls into the Shat-ul-Arab, 5 miles below Kurnah, after a course of upwards of 500 miles.

See next page .—the Reveune Department List of villages, etc., of the district of Zohab, it is mentioned that the sub-district of Kasr-i-Shirin is composed of 10 villages. “ The interest of Kasr-i-Shirin is that it lies among masses' of ancient rubble, and that the slopes which surround it are completely covered with hewn and unhewn stones of all sizes, the relics of a great city, at the western extremity of which the present wretched hamlet stands. The walls, which are easily traced, enclose an irregular square, the shortest front of which is said to be three miles long. They aro built of roughly hewn blocks of gray and red sandstone, and very hard mortar or concrete.144 “ Within this enclosure are remains of houses, built of water worn round stones, which lie in in monstrous heaps, and of a large fort on an eminence. In another direction are the ruins of an immense palace of quadrangular form, with only one entrance ; and large underground rooms now nearly cooked up. There are remains of what must have been very fine archways, but as the outer coating of hewn stone and all the decorations have fallen oft leaving only the inner case of rough rubble and concrete, the architectural forms are very badly defined, and the aspect, of what must once have been magnificent, is now forbidding and desolate. The remains of an aqueduct cut in the rock, and of troughs and stone pipes, by which water was brought into the palace and city from a distance of fifteen miies, are still traceable amono’ the desolations ; but, of the beautiful gardens which they watered, and with which Khosroe surrounded the beautiful Shinn, not a trace remains” {Mrs. Bishop). In 1834, J. R. Fraser wrote on the subject : “The principal remains of building are a large mass of ruinous walls and arches, called the Kasr; and another, still mere in decay, at some distance, called the Manzil (residence) of Shirowiveh, the son of Khosroe. The Kasr contains several large apartments, and some passages and ranges of vaults, which I could not examine ; but the principal object is what is now called the tomb of the fair Shireen herself, but which I take to have been a gate way and vestibule to the palace. It has four aichways ) 3 leading tiom without, and the fourth into the building.” IVlr. He Morgan savs t Near tbe present town was the fortiess, Kalleh- i-Khosroe, with flanking towers and containing the barracks. South, near the present caravanserai, is a square heap of ruins, of which I was unable to make out the destination. West of these ruins was a villa, the lower parts of which can still be easily made out. « To the north of the Citadel one meets heaps of ruins and rubble, remains of part of the ancient town or of barracks; as the old town seems to have occupied the same site as the present one. At 600 metres, on the northern side of the fortified camp, are the walls of the gardens, large enclosure of about 6,000 paces iu circumference, and w! ich enclose about 120 hectares. “ The walls have not been regularly traced. Being used, as an enclosure, as well as aqueduct, they follow the declivity of the ground, and offer sali nt and ingoing angles, curves and absolutely straight sections. “ Towards the east and south of the enclosures, the wails are best preserv ed, and reach betimes 6 50 metres, but are usually not more than 2 metres high. “ In following this enclosure one meets to the south a remarkable quad- rilat eral, which I at first mistook for a reservoir, but which I found out to be an ingenious system for distributing water at various levels. Then, facing the principal palace, one finds a gate with its guard-room, and the quarters of the servants who were stationed at this point. “ An aqueduct-wall, starting from the south-east corner, carried water to the principal palace, and at the same time divided tbe gardens in two, just as at the present day. The gardens of Mussulman palaces are divided into gardens reserved to the harem, and gardens opened to visitors, &lt;e Near the south gate are the ruins of a palace called Kalleh-i-Chahar- Kupi, or the castle of the four doorways, which was probably the divan, the ball where the sovereign gave audience. -145 Tins Cci^tls was situated in a court, enclosed by an aqueduct-wall wliicli brought water to it. “ In the centre of the gardens was the principal palace, Amarat-i-Khosroe, K hosroe the second's palace : immense construct ion, laid out in an east to west direction, as, all the buildings of the same period ; and preceded by a large terrace and a sheet of water, 600 metres in length and 50 broad, witlTa kiosk on either side. Amarat-i-Khosroe is a large building, 342 metres in length ; and measur ing at its widest part, which is nearly in the middle, 187 metres. Kaileh-i-Khosroe is one of the rare complete examples of military archi tecture of the Sa^sanian speech. It is composed of a square, the sides of which measure 180 metres, and are flanked by 6 towers each. In the interior are still to be seen remains of buildings, which were pro bably barracks, d here were also buildings near the gates. Two gates led to the inside the ramparts, one west and the other south. These gates were reached by a slope, carried on a bridge which spanned the moat.' KASSEHKERAN or Kasikaran.

Kerind is situated 56 miles west of Kermanshah on the road from Kermanshah to Baghdad. It is described by Eraser as grotesquely, rather than pictures- quely, placed at the mouth of a gorge between two precipitous hills. Ihe houses, though small, are neat and built in terraces on the slope of the serge, with the naked and scarped rock rising abruptly above them. Kicb gardens extend up the defiles and along the base of the mountain, which produce a variety of fruits, including the celebrated stoneless grape, mown L that of Kerind (Asghari grapes). The willow and the lofty poplar148 attain a considerable size on tbe margin of a mountain stream that bisects the village, and is afterwards turned of into smaller channels for tbe supply of the gardens in the plain. Several copious springs issuing from the plain* which is here 3 miles broad, add their water to numerous mountain streams ; and form the sources of the Ab-i-Kerind, the north-west tributary of the Karkhah river. Kerind contains 1,’200 houses. The people live by culti vation ; and there is a brisk trade on account of the constant passage of pilgrims. The women weave some fine gilims. Cutlery, metal work and gun-making are the principal industries of the town. A rough imitation of the Peabody-Martini and Henry-Martini are manufactured h^re, and bought up by the tribesmen. No cartridges are made here, but the ones imported, or smuggled from Baghdad, are recapped by hand, and used over and over again until worn out. The inhabitants are Alullahis. “ There is here a large caravanserai which, like others on the road, was built by Hajji Hashem Khan (Zengeneh), father of the Amir-i Nizam ; who appears to have passed his life and spent his fortune in works of benevolence and charity, and who was reawarded lately by the loss of his eyes, which Mohammed Hussein Mirza put out, I know not on what pretext/'—(*/.

The Kerindi, who are supposed to be a branch of the Gurans, are said to have bought Kerind from the Guran chief: of Kalleh Zanjir, some 110 years ago. Of the recent history of the chiefs of Kerind, this is what was related by Mr. T. C. Plowden in 1881 : “Some 50 years ago, Hyat Kuli Khan, son of Malek Niaz Khan, was chief of Kerind, and Haji Khan, a Turkoman of Khoi in Azarbaijan, was Governor of Kermanshah. One winter, Haji Khan visited Kerind and sorely oppressed the people, not only by his pecuniary exactions but espe cially by forcing them to yield their wives and daughters to his desires. In vain the Seyyeds of the town laid the Koran before him, and entreated his forebearance. Haji Khan would not listen to them. At length the people could stand it no longer, and rising against him, attacked the house iu which he was living. Haji Khan barricaded all the doors, and for a time he kept his assailants at bay. The latter, however, were thoroughly roused, and climbing on the terrace, broke through the roof and effected an entrance. They made short work of Haji Khan, A massacre of his attendants followed; every man of them who pronounced the word Gosht with a Turkoman accent was cut down. After this event Hyat Kuli Khan ruled Kerind, more or less continually, until his death. “ He left four sons, Malek Niaz Khan, Abbas Kuli Khan, Ali Murad Khan and Karim Khan. Malek Niaz Khan, the eldest, succeeded his father, and lost his life about 15 years ago in an expedition against the Ahmadavands (Hamavands). His horse ran away and carried him to the enemy's tents, where he was shot. His second brother, Abbas Kuli Khan, succeeded to the Chiefship, and died suddenly about 5 years ago in Kermanshah. The Chiefship then devolved upon Ali Murad Khan, who now holds it, and whose acquaintance I made at Pa-i-Tak. He is a good looking man of about 45 years, with as fair a skin as any Englishman *, his152 manners are courteous, simple an J on e^ceflent terms with events were sensible and to the point.

PROVINCE of KERMANSHAH— The province of Kermanshah is contiguous to the provinces of Kurdistan, Hamadan, Malayer and Tui-Sirkan, Nehavend and Luristan, and extends up to the Turkish frontier from Mendali to Banakilan. Before entering on the subject of the local produce of Kermanshah and Local produce of Ker- district, it is necessary to give an idea of the extent snaushah and district. of the province* The province of Kermanshah lies between lat. 34° to 35° N. and long. 44° 5' to 48° O' E. Its boundaries are the vilayet of Bagdad (Kalleh Sabzi) and Luristan Kuchik, or Pusht-i-Kuh, to the west and south, and Kurdistan and the Governorships of Kangavar (pass of Beet Surkh) to the north and east. The small Governorships of Kangavar and Assadabad have recently been added to the province of Kermanshah. The province of Kermanshah contains a great number of villages, mostly Villages and villagers. inhabited by Kurds and Lurs. It is known for its great production of grain and for its cattle. The soil being fertile, and water plentiful in all seasons, the greater part Production of wheat and of the province is either under cultivation, or forms barley, natural pasture grounds of large extent. The land is cultivated separately, each villager looking after his own bit of land. On account o£ the numerous mountains, which retain the rain-water, part of the land is turned into “daim,” which does not require to be watered ; the rest, or “ abi'■* land, is easily irrigated and without great outlay of capital ; kanats are very scarce in this part of Persia. Daim ” land is sown with corn, and allowed to lie fallow every other year ; ef abi ” land, or irrigated land, is sown with grain one year and with “ seifi ” (garden crops such as water melons, melons, cucumbers, etc.) the following year. We hear numerous accounts of the enormous surplus of grain produc tion, and the consequently cheap prices. In 1875 Captain Napier wrote : “A rough estimate, by several natives of surplus produce of the province, gives a total of 380,000 kharvars (139,333 tons*) of wheat and barley, as ready to be placed in the market after the last harvest (1875), at the low price of 8 krans per kharvar. Wheat was un saleable as late as November, and it was stated that many landowners had their granaries filled with wheat of the preceding year, which must be given to the cattle, or even burnt, to make room for new crops.'”'}* * 880,000 kharvars = 110,098 tons, not 139,333 tons. The unity of weight in Kermanshah is the Mann Tabriz! ; consequently, 1 kharvar = 649 lbs. f There are two ways of storing grain in the province of Kermanshah. The usual way is to dig a large hole and lay straw in it ; the grain is then poured in the middle, and the hole covered over and kahgelled. Each hole contains from 6 to 7 kbarvars, and grain thus stored can be kept for many years, unless it be eaten by insects. The other way is to put the grain in store-rooms, where it occasionally gets damaged, when the rain-water leaks through the roof. As soon as insects are found in a store, or when the grain has been damaged by water, it is either given to the cattle or destroyed, as it has no chance of sale. By the first system, proprietors are not obliged to empty their granaries to make room for new crops.154 Mr. Presce in 1899* wrote: neighbourhood is agriculture. « The great industry o£ Kermanshah and it§ u 10 The people are chiefly employed in tilling their fields. Wheat and barley used to be found in great abundance and also extraordinarily cheap; as for instance, in 1875 wheat was at 8 krans a kharvar (about 7s. a tout), but it went up to 25 krans (1£ s. .) a on in 1885, and in 1897, when I was at Kermanshah, it was at^oO krans and even then it was cheaper than elsewhere in Persia. The winter or 1 98 was a very dry one, and a general failure of the grain crop?, was t m result, so that during the year there has been great scarcity, and m conse quence, the price of grain rose to 125 krans a kharvar. r lhe total output for the province, in a normal year, may be taken at 180,000 k bar vans (80,000 tonsj), after supplying the needs of a population of about 850,000 souls/' Mr. H. J. Whigham, in his article of July 11, 1902, in the “ Morning Post,' tells us that Kermanshah has been peculiarly favoured by nature in many ways. ...... It stands in the very centre of the richest grain country of Persia, and, perhaps, of the whole East, for the simple reason, that among the mountains of Kmrdistan, the winter snows and spring rains are so plentifidj as to preclude in most years the necessity of irrination, which is a sin6 qua non in most parts of Mesopotamia, and Persia. At the same time, the mountains are not a hindrance to agiicuituie, because they form well defined ridges, between which the valleys aie broad, level and exceedingly fertile. Where nature has been so liberal, man has done nothing to reap the benefit, and communications are so deficient in Persia, that it is impossible to get an abundance of grain, even to the com paratively local markets of Teheran on the one hand, and of Bagdad on the other. When I was in Kermanshah, the prospects of the coming harvest were so good, that wheat was actually selling for 8 krans a kharvar and barley for 10 krams. A kran is at present worth about and a kharvar is equal to 650 lbs. A simple calculation, therefore, will show that the price of wheat was a little over 7d. per cwt., and of barley just 9r/. per cwt. These figures are not unique, though they are certainly unusually low. At the same time the prices in Bagdad, only 220 miles away, were six times as great. At Sultanabad I found already a considerable difference, wheat fetching about 25. per cwt., while at Teheran the price was multiplied twelve times, that is to say, wheat and barley were standing at 12 tomans a kharvar (95. a cwt.). “ Though Teheran is but 330 miles from Kermansbab, it cost at least twelve times what the grain is worth on the spot,do transport it over that distance; for which a railway freight could not be more than Id. a cwt., or the equivalent of the local price, and might easily be a good deal less. It is not difficult, therefore, to understand that during the great famine in Teheran, when wheat had to be imported from Russia at enormous cost, the grain was actually lying rotting in the fields of Kurdistan. To add to the absurdity of the situation an embargo has been placed on the export of cereals, so that up to last year the Kermanshah farmers might not send * Diplomatic and Consular Report No. 2260, Isfahan and District, 1897-99. t But in 1875 1£ was worth 27 krans, consequently, if 1£. = 27 krans, and8krans = l kharvar, and 1 kharvar = 650 lbs. and 2,240 lbs. = l ton, 1 ton = l£.

V X155 W' their surplus to Bagdad, to which transport charges, though large enough, are comparatively speaking favourable. u Last year's harvest was one of the best on record in this province of large harvests, it is said that there was a surplus o£ 250,000 kharvars, an unprecedented amount. Unfortunately this year's harvest, of which the prospects were so good, has completely failed. The price has risen lately from 10 krans (March 20, 1902) to 15 and IB krans (August 20, 1902) in town. In the villages the prices range from 8 to 15 and 20 krans, according to the distance of the villages from Kermanshah, and from the Bagdad route and the frontier. The embargo,* which was enforced anew, has just been waived, and the Governor has been allowed to act for the best. In the present circumstanees the embargo does no good whatever, as grain can neither be exported to the interior of Persia, nor will the owners sell it at a price which, after deducting the cost of transport to town, would only leave them some 2 or 3 krans per kharvar. Grain is at its cheapest immediately after the harvest, when landowners and villagers having each taken their portion, the villagers are practically obliged to sell their lot for ready cash, in order to make provision for the winter.' There is a considerable rise in the price of barley during the winter months, when large caravans of pilgrims pass here on their way to Kerbela. The following are at present the charges on grain exported to Bagdad. For every kharvar (100 manns):—* Transport ••• Governor, for permit ... ... ... Governor’s secretary ... ... „.

The grain crop this year was bad, and showed a deficit of about 25 per Grain . cent, on the usual output. Three causes are mentioned ; Harvest. locusts and insects, which this year caused great (it03-1904.) destruction; insufficient rainfall ,* ravages and depredat ions of the Kakavans and Tirhan Amrais, and of the Kalhor and Sinjabi sowars or horsemen sent in pursuit. Last year's grain from March 20, 1903, to October, fetched from 10 to 12 krans per kharvar. The new grain in October, immediately after harvest, fetched 15 krans per kharvar. Last year's barley fetched 15 krans per kharvar. This year’s barley was sold immediately after the harvest at 26 to 28 krans. The ambars (stores) had been emptied last year, as proprietors * Not withstanding the embargo, whole caravans of grain pass the frontier on their way to Bagdad. f In November the charges were reduced by the Governor to 2*50 krans.157 ‘'W Up till Mardi 10 the prospects of tlie new crop were very discouraging, as autumn rains had completely failed, and spring rains had not yet set in.

Cleaned rice cost 174 tomans per kharvar. About 10,000 kharvars of peas are produced yearly in the province of i v ^ Kermanshah. Some 2,000 kharvars are usually ex- eas ^ a 0 * ported to the interior of Persia. Prices stood at 12 to 15 tomans per kharvar. Maize, clover, castor oil plant, cotton and indigo, garden crops such as Other agricultural pro- melons, water melons, cucumbers, egg ^ plants, toma- ducts. toes are also grown for local consumption. Pruits are abundant during the fruit season. The fruits of Kenduleh, .. Hersin and Sabna are famous, and are brought to Fruits. , n 1 town lor sale. Kerind has excellent grapes; dried figs from Rijab are well known, and Gahwarreh at one time had fine apples. Oranges and lemons are received from Mendali, Turkey. \£V158 The usual trees of the plains of Kermanshah are the willow, poplar, Trees. Oriental plane and walnut, and the fruit trees of Northern Europe. Palm trees are to be found in the gardens of Sar-i-pol-i-Zohab and Kasr-i-Shirin, In the mountains one finds oak, elm, sycamore and some small coniferous trees. In the mountains near Huleilan, I came across the following trees :~— Cratcegus, Ficus, Daphne acuminata B. et Boh., Quercus Persica, Acer, lonicera, Trunus Mahaleb, Fistacia KinjuJc, Amygdalus Koteckyi Storks, &amp;c. The flora is varied, and occasionally rare specimens are to be found. Bear, wolf, hare, wild goat, gazelle, partridge, small partridge (teihoo), Game sand grouse, geese, duck and other birds of passage, such as the small and large bustard, woodcock, snipe, double snipe, quail, &amp;c., are abundant in this province. The rivers Karasu and Gramasiab have also fine fish. a After wheat one of the next largest products of the country is wool. ’Wool, The vast flocks of Kurds and Lurs, grazing all over the green hills of these countries, supply a great quan tity of fair quality wool, which might be vastly improved by a little care in breeding. It, however, is mainly used in various industries in which the women are only employed., such as carpet weaving. . . They also make tent covers; saddle bags, ropes, and also yarns, which are exported to Irak and Luristan, yet when all these requirements are fulfilled about 1,000,000 lbs. of wool are exported via Bagdad. Little care is taken in cleaning the wool, and there are no presses in the place, either hand or hydraulic, so that the bales are bulky, and, in consequence, the export is all done by means of camels / , —[Gazetteer of Persia.) Although this was written many years ago, the conditions are still the same, excepting that the amount of wool exported is, according to the custom-house books, much less. The Kermansbah wool, known as pashm Kurdi 33 or Kurdish wool, Wool. comes from Luristan, the districts of the Kalhors, (1903-1901 ) Gurans, Sinjabis and Kuliais, and from the vicinity of the town of Kermanshah, The total output is estimated at about 2,000 kharvars of half-washed wool (nim shusteh), of which up to recent years, 1,500 kharvars went to Baghdad, route to the United Kingdom, Marseilles and the United States; and the balance was either exported to the interior of Persia or consumed in the province. Since the last two years it would appear that only 500 to 1,000 kharvars of wool go to Baghdad, whilst 200 kharvars are retained in the province, and the balance goes to Sultanabad. The Kermanshah wool is all u bahari,” or spring wool, the Cl paizi,” or autumn wool does not amount too much, and, being of inferior quality, is made use of for the manufacture of namdas,” or felts, which form the winter overcoats of most of the Kurds. The wool is bought from the tribesmen in four different ways, by (a) peddlers, called locally (i charchi/'or “ sahra-row,” who buy the wool maund, either for cash or against goods supplied ; (b) middlemen who buy, the wool during the winter at 2 to 3 kraus per sheep and take delivery in spring.I 159 A sheep hears about | maund Tabriz! of unwashed wool; (c) middlemen who at the clipping season visit all the villages or encampments in the wool districts, and purchase from villagers and nomads. These middlemen usually borrow money at 20 per cent, per annum from the wool merchants in Kermansbah, and repay them in wool at the rate of the day; (d) merchants, who advance money to the chiefs of the tribes, half the sum lent bearing no interest, but being against wool to be delivered in spring, at a price fixed beforehand, sometimes as low as 20 or 25 tomans per kharvar, and the other half bearing interest at 2d per cent., and repayable in wool at the rate of the day or in cash. There is usually 10 per cent, of black or coloured hair in the wool, this is sorted and sent apait to Baghdad for sale. The 100 maunds, after being washed, produce 60 mauads of wool costing 53d krans. After adding freight from Kermansbah to Baghdad, the 60 maunds of half-washed wool cost in Baghdad 617 krans, to which must be added from three to five months’ loss of interest (12 per cent.) on capital employed. In reply to an inquiry as to why more care was not taken in washing and sorting the wool, the Kermanshah wool merchants declared that no^skin cotton rags or pieces of string were contained in the wool exported by them! They did not wash the wool so well for export as f( r spinning in the country; as well washed wool scarcely fetched a better price in Baghdad than the usual wool exported there. As regards of the pressing bales, the process would only leave them a loss, as (as far as they were concerned) the wool was only intended for the Baghdad market, and bulky bales presented no more difficulty for trans port by camel than pressed bales. For spinning purposes the wool is washed with better care, the process spun wool. costing 10 krans more than for washing for export. The 100 maunds only produce 50 maunds, which when spun are reduced to 47 or 48 maunds. The spinning, which costs 24 krans per maund, is done by the Kurdish women at odd moments, a family taking 8 to 12 days to spin 1 maund. 40 to 50 kharvars of spun wool are now exported lo Sultanabad for the carpet industy, and 30 to 40 kharvars are used locally in the province of Kermanshah, for the manufacture of carpets, rugs, gilims and woollen cloths. The season for purchasing and exporting wool in Kermanshah is June, July and August. “ is only cultivated in the immediate neighbourhood of the 0 P m mj town, the output is small, viz.j, 300 boxes; in 1885 * ’ output was but 180 boxes. Other opium comes from Burujird, Is'ehavend and Hamadan. The box weighs from 20 ( l3 ° to 14:8 lbs *)&gt; and costs about 2,800 to 3,200 krans (TOo to £64) . — (jPreeee.) The opium exported from Kermanshah, via Baghdad, is either got from (1903-1904.) Nehavend, Malayer, Burujird, Luristan, or is pro- . ’ dneed locally. Opium is cultivated in the followino* districts and tub-districts of Kermanshah:—Herein, Tang-i-SIndian.

It is sown by the K aka van and other Lekk tribes, whose territory borders on that of Kermanshah. The Kermanshah opium is said to be very strong and is mostly used for local consumption. Pure opium is called ie Shirreh/’ For local consump tion opium is prepared in sticks, and is soil at about 17 tomans per maund Tabrizi. About 20 kharvars of opium (raw) is consumed locally by the “ waffur” smokers. Of tbe Burujirid opium Mr. J. R. Preece says in his report on the trade of the Isfahan district, 1894, No. 1376 Annual Series u This opium is not used for direct exportation as it is not very good, being deficient in morphia (on the average it containing only some 7 4 to 8 per cent., whilst 10 to 11 ^ per cent, is the amount admissible for London). It is used for internal consumption, and for adulterating such opium as contains morphia above the required quantity.” Good Persian opium contains 12 to 13 per cent, morphia (no such opium passes through Baghdad), and in the London market the price chiefly depends on the percentage of morphia. In Hong-Kong the per centage of morphia is not a great factor in the opium market. Kermanshah opium usually contains 8 | per cent, of morphia, and has at the present time a very good name on the Hong-Kong market, the adulteration which was practised some years ago having ceased. The total amount exported via Baghdad during the year 1903-1904 was 20,422'40 batmans, the total amount for the previous year being 21,840 batmans. At the beginning of the season prepared opium was offered at 2,600 krans per chest, but buyers held aloof. Prices rose gradually, and in November reached 3,700 kraus per chest, at which rate small transactions took place. The greater part of the prepared opium changed hands at 3,400 krans per chest.!» 163 Of the total amount of opium export*! from Kormaoshali to Baghdad, 90 percent, goes to Hong-Kong aed 10 per cent, finds its way to London and Egypt. Tobacco is cultivated in the Guran district, which is said to number some 50 villages or settlements. Cjahwareh is the Tobacco (tutun). chief village of the Guran district and the cent re of the tobacco-growing district. It” is 11 farsakhs distant from the town of Kermanshah. The total produce amounts to some 2,000 to 5,000 kharvars of tobacco per annum, prices ranging from 0'75* to 10 krans per maund, according to quality. The tobacco is brought to town m sacks by the v;\Uo' e rs A lar^e quantity is exported from Kermanshah to leheran and the districts. Packing costs 13-50 krans per case of 25 or 30 maunds. Kermanshah tobacco merchants are Dai-Golam, Hajji Ah Bazaz, Haj^i Mirza Hussein, Seyycd Nasrullah and the Sherakat Amteeh Omoomi. It is certain that a large quantity of tobacco^ is exported to Turkey, evading Persian and Turkish customs alike. This is done by the Jaits and other tribes, when migrating frcm their summer to their winter quarters. The Customs authorities are well aware of the fact, but, apart from the seizure of a few loads of tobacco they are unable to prevent this abuse. In former days a considerable quantity of tobacco (about 12,000 loads a year) was sent to Baghdad, but since the introduction of the Kegie the export has fallen to very little. &lt;f The o’um tragacanth, Katyra, finds a fairly large exportation j after the Gmns and pinT grain harvest is garnered, the people of Kermanshah and tragacantb, “Kat- its villages distribute themselves all over the districts yra/’ i n search of this gum, which, when collected, they send into the town, where it is sorted and exported. The prices realised seem to be fairly remunerative, and from what I could see the trade is extending.^ —{Preece,} 897.) There are four principal qualities of gum tragacanth offered for sale in the Kermanshah market :-«-The first quality 19C3-1904. i s received from Burujird, Nehavend and Kermanshah, caSh^or katyra 1 aga ' and fetches unsorted from 28 to 32 krans per maund Tabriz!. It is sorted into three classes, which fetch about 35 to 36, 30 to 31, and 28 to 29 krans respectively. The scond quality is received from Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Nehavend and Burujird, and fetches unsorted from 11 to 18 krans per maund. It is sorted into five classes, fetching about 22, 18, 14, 12 and 8 krans per macnd respectively. The third quality (“ Zardeh ” in Arabic) is known in Persia under the name of “ Arrehbor ;; (cut with a saw), as the gum exudes from the branches which have been cut with a saw. Arrehbor costs 8 to 11 krans per maund. 'When sorted, the different classes fetch 12, 9, 8 and 6 krans per maund respectively. It is obtained from Mount Dalahu, Puskt-i-Kuh, Khor- remabad and Burujird, The fourth quality, or stone gum, which is known under the name of Kurreh (Kora), is obtained from Mount Daiahu, Pusht*i~Knk, Khorremabad and Burujird. It is quoted now at from 7 to ® Tie rates during the season varied from 40 to 60 tomans.163 71 krans per maund. The prices were much lower in former years ; 4 to 5 krans being asked for 1 maund. When soited, the different classes fetch 10, 6 and 4 krans per maund respectively. Gum tragacanth is obtained from a plant called by the Persians “ Gavan”. The plants giving the various qualities of gum traganth are all known under the name of gavan, and I do not know which quality is obtained from the Astragalus verm. Astragalus verus is plentiful between Hamadan and Kermanshah, First quality katyra is obtained from the plant, known as Ci Gavansefid” or white gavan, by incisions, from which the gum exudes. Second quality is obtained from the yellow gavan which is a larger plant than ti e gavan- sefid. The top of the plant is burnt, and when the leaves are all consumed the fire is put out and incisions are made. The following morning the gum which has oozed out of the incisions is gathered. This operation is repeated three or four times, the quality improving each time. The Arrehbor gum exudes from the branch of a small tree, the top of which has been burnt and the branches then cut with a saw. The branches are cut three or four times. The plant-yielding Kora is treated in the same way as that yielding Arrehbor gum. The operation is repeated three times, and the quality of the gum deteriorates each time. After seven years’ constant tapping the gavan plants dry up. The indiscriminate tapping of the plant-givingkatyra will soon cause the supply of gums to diminish. Already the fields in the vicinity of Kermanshah are almost completely exhausted. Speaking of the gum industry in the province of Pars, Lieutenant- Colonel C. A. Kemball, in his report on the trade of the Persian Gulf for the year 1900 (No. 2631 Annual Series), says : &lt;( It appears that the peasantry, employed in the collection of the tmgacanth, work in a reckless manner, causing much damage to the plants, which are burnt down, after (before) incision, to such an extent as to render the same field unproductive for some years to come. Though the tragacanth fields are numerous and extensive, they will not be able to withstand the wholesale depredations which are now being perpetrated on them, unless the Persian Government undertakes their supervision with a view to maintaining and improving the industry/’ What Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball says about Ears, applies as well to Kermanshah, Luristan and Kurdistan. The first quality of tragacanth gum of Fars is said to be equal to the second quality of Kermanshah. Exports to Baghdad amounted this year to 1,496 kharvars, against 1,410 kharvars last year, I am assured that for every 3 maunds exported to Baghdad 1 maund is exported to Russia, via Reskt or Tabriz, Of the gum exported from Kermanshah to Baghdad, about seven-eights goes to London, one-sixteenth to France and one-sixteenth to Germany.“ Sakkis ” ** Sakkis ’* mastic). (gum mag tic) is obtained from the forests of Huleilan Pnsbt-i- (g Um Kuh. It is divided into three qualities, known by them and Persians as Price per Maund Tabrizi. White gum ••• Yellow |, Plack i» Krans. 5 4 3 Sakkis gum, unsorted, fetched during the year from 4 to 5i krans per maund. All the Sakkis gum is exported to Russia. The trade is very considerable, but it is impossible to obtain accurate information here. The figures for gums, in the Tabriz and Resht Custom-house returns for exports, probably represent the yearly output of Sakkis gum of Luristan, Kurdistan and Soleimanieh. Kermanshali also produces a peculiar kind of Gez (manna), called Gez Alati. of inferior quality. Gez Alafi. ' ^ The Gez-i-guti found here is all from Isfahan. A few boxes of Gezengebin are prepared here. Gez Alafi costs about 3^ krans per mann, and is used for medicinal pur poses. The Kurds are very foud of the stuff. Other local products are ghi or clarified butter, cotton in small quantity, packing bags, black hair tents * wooden combs and clay chaplets, which are greatly appreciated by the Persians. Felts “ namdas ” are prepared here, and there are also many Giveh makers. Although the carpet industry is nearly extinct, it may be worth while quoting what has been said of it by previous travel- Carpets. i ers ^ an d making some remarks as to the present state of that industry. “The carpets of Kermanshah are a manufacture which adds much to the wealth of the province; none can be more rich, soft and beautiful, the colours more brilliant; but these are not their only merits, for they are cheap and very durable. These carpets are made in the villages and in the tents of the nomad tribes, generally by women and children. Here there is no complicated machinery, four stakes fixed in the ground, which serve to twist the woollen thread, form the simple mechanism employed in weaving these beautiful carpets. * ( Kermanshah was celebrated for the richness and beauty of its carpets, but scarcely one is now obtainable. Industry, indeed, is at present unknown on the spot, where thousands of busy fingers were daily occupied in weaving • “ The tents, which are the sole habitation of the nomad tribes, are made of black goats* hair blankets stretched upon poles, and are often very considerable structures, divided by reed partitions into several compartments, used as the diwan khaneh or reception chamber, the men’s and the women’s quarters, the kitchen, the stables, and the cowshed.”— (Curzon.) A tent, which was lately presented to the Governor, measured about 60 feet in length, 30 feet in width, and was 20 feet high.165 thoae beautiful and justly famed specimens of Persian workmanship. The causes of this lamentable decline of the trade and the arts are owing to the rapacity of its successive Governors, and to plague and cholera .”—(Gazetteer of Persia, 1885.) Two years later, Mrs. Bishop (1887) wrote: “Kermanshah is famous for its rugs, as carpets are called in this country. There are from 25 to 80 kinds, with their specific names.” Mrs. Bishop must have been misled on this point, as it is quite certain that at the time of her visit to Kermanshah, the carpet industry no longer existed in this province, “ A few carpets are made in Kermanshah ; they are fine and good in quality, but Kermanshah has not advanced with the rest of the country, and in consequence the designs are poor, being only of two kinds, the well- known one called Herati, and the equally well-known shawl design.” “ The Kermanshah people do not appear to use aniline dyes to the same extent as the Kurds.”—1899.) Some fine carpets are occasionally made by the Guran women. Gilims, some of them greatly appreciated, are woven in Hersin, Kerind and a few other places. The carpet industry has nearly disappeared. The Kurds prefer weaving Giliros, which are sooner finished and easily sold, and not often confiscated by the Chiefs of the tribes or the Governors. Mules and horses are bred in great numbers. There are extensive pasture lands, and forage is plentiful. The horses when well bred have much Arab blood, and fetch good prices. The mules are strong, and most of the charvadars apply to this province for their requirements. To buy horses one has to go to the tribes, as few are brought to Kermanshah for sale, and few are exported via Baghdad, on account of the heavy duty charged by the Turkish authorities. Mules up to the age of four years can be bought in the villages; past that age they are taken over by charvadars for transport. A good, fully developed mule fetches from 50 to 100 tomans. Kermanshah was for many years famous for its horses, but the breeding Horseg&gt; is not what it used to be. From 50 to 100 Arab horses are brought every year from Baghdad by pilgrims. Prices range from 30£ T. to 1C0£ T. These horses are seldom offered for sale. Horses are bred by the Sinjabis, Kalhors and Kuliais ; and in Kurdistan and a few of the villages. The Kalhors, having many horsemen, have not many horses for sale. They dispose of a few to the pilgrims passing from Kermanshah, to Khanikin, or vice versa. The Sinjahi horses have much Arab blood, and, although rather small, are better than other horses of the province. The Sinjabis are said to have about 1,000 horses and mares, producing yearly 200 foals. They are good for draught and as beasts of burden. The Kuliais have some 500 to 600 horses, producing yearly about 100 colts. Their horses are said to be not very strong. They occasionally buy mares for breeding purposes from the Jaffs and Khezels.168 Colta having good blood fetch, when ono or two years old, from 20 to 30 tomans. Those from the Jaffs are sold at 40 to 50 tomans. One to two- year old “ Yabus ’ can be bought at 15 to 16 tomans, An ordinary horse, four to five years old, can be bought amongst the tribes at from 30 to 40 tomans. The best season for buying horses and mules is about one month after the feast of Norooz (Marched). In winter, on account of the great demand for transport, horses and mules are expensive. Young horses intended for caravan work are accustomed, when three to four years old, to carry loads. 50 maunds is a usual load for a full^ de veloped horse, but up to 70 maunds is sometimes carried. The usual lifetime of a horse is 15 to 20 years, ihe cost of shoeing a horse is 4 krans, if inferior qualify shoes be used, the price is orny ^2 kiano. il The shoe, in universal use, consists of a thin plate of iion, about I4 to 2 inches wide, hammered to the shape of the hoof,^ which it nearly covers , and is fastened on by four or six large headed naits. They last for about 10 weeks/' Mules are bred by the Sinjabis, Kuliais, Kalhors, in Kurdistan ; and in Harasam and near Kermanshah. Some 2,000 to Mules * 3,000 mules are produced yearly, I am told, in the province. AH the mules are proouced by mares. A one-year old mule fetches from 30 to 50 tomans. A good three-year old mule costs from 70 to 80 tomans ; although mules of that age are also to be got for 55 tomans, but they are not then so well developed. When three to four years old, the mule is accustomed to carry loads of 20 maunds ; from four to five it carries from 35 to 40 maunds and when fiv * 50 to 60 maunds. The usual load is consequently 320 to 390 lbs., and this’ lead the mule carries a distance of 20 to 30 miles, day after day. The lifetime of a mule is 20 to 30 years. Shoeing costs 3 krans. The cost of a complete pack-saddle for a mule is 14 tomans. Riding donkeys, used by the mollahs (priests) and merchants, are got from Helleh, Baghdad, Shiraz, Yezd and Kerman, Donkeys. and fetch from 25 to 50 tomans. The ordinary small black or grey donkey, kept by the villagers and tribes men, and supplying the means of transport for local produce, is bred in the province and fetches from 10 to 25 tomans. Every village has from 10 to 50 of these donkeys, Shoeing costs 1*50 krans. A kharvar is said to be the load of three donkeys. The usual load is consequently about 216 lbs. fora donkey. Camels. No camels are bred in the province of Kerman* shah. From 2,000 to 3,000 camels come here every year from Isfahan, Kum, Yezd and Kashan ; and carry goods from here to Teheran or Isfahan, or return without loads. Arab camelmen come from Baghdad and take loads to Hamadan, and occasionally some direct to Teheran. They usually take no loads for the return journey, except during the wool season. They also take grain to Turkey and sometimes, but very rarely, a few cases of gum.167 A certain number of cows and oxen are bred in the province, but the CovvSs Kermanshah peasantry have, however, to import cows and oxen from Luristan. The nomads who use cows and oxen, not only to plough their fields, but also to carry their tents and belongings, seldom, if ever, part with them. Beef in Kermanshah is good. Oxen, which refuse to carry the yoke, are given over to the slaughter-house. Herds of goats are to be found in the mountainous districts of Kerman- Goatsi&lt; shah ; goats' hair is used in the manufacture of tents. Goat-skins are either dried for export to Baghdad and Marseilles ; made up into coverings for ghi, or turned into water skins or “ mashks/'’ of which every nomad family has at least two or three. Sheep are plentiful in the province of Kermanshah, and form part of the gheep. wealth of the nomads. Wool is exported in large quantities, and a considerable amount of ghi is produced j but Governors usually prohibit the exportation of ghi to the interior of Persia. This year's permits could be obtained by the payment of 60 krans per kharvar. The Kurds of the mountains and province of Kermanshah, in a great Cattle. degree, supply the Teheran, Hamadan, Korn and Baghdad markets with sheep. To these places they drive whole flocks destined for sale, but of late they prefer selling their flocks in Turkey. Guts —About 40 sheep and goats are killed daily in Kermanshah and, during the pilgrim season, the number is sometimes as high as 140. In sum mer, when the flocks of the lliyats (nomads) are near lion, for every three goats, one sheep is killed, whilst in winter the proportion is the reverse. Guts from goats are about 17 to 18 zars Tabrizi long, and sheep-guts are from 24 to 30 zars long. The guts have to be cleaned and made into lengths of 28 metres. 1,000 guts, which cost uncleaned from 9 to 20 tomans, give about 700 cleaned and prepared guts, fetching 40 tomans. Until quite recently guts were simply thrown away. The amount of prepared guts, exported yearly from the province of Kermanshah, is as follows :— Number of guts. From To Kermanshali ... 18,000 20,000 Sungor ... 5UO 700 Kangavar 700 800 Assadahad ... 800 900 In all from 20,000 to 22.400 guts, worth about 1,000 to 1,300 tomans. Ghi, which is sold at from 4 to 6 krans at the beginning of spring, rises to 10 or 12 krans in winter, and is usually bought up in summer by rich people, to be sold in winter at famine prices.168 fn the lower valleys of the Kermansbab province, near the Turkish frontier, there exists a wide oil belt which extends south, from Kerkuk in Turkey to Shuster in Persia, and even to. the island of Hormuz ; following a north-west to south-east direction. The principal oil fields of the province of Kermanshah are those of Chia- Surkh, Shah Murad, Kerim Khan and Bazargar, Hoorin, Gahwarreh and Shian. There are also indications of naphtha at other localities. From the numerous ancient cemeteries and fire temples one comes across in these districts, it is evident that the extraction of the oil has been carried on since the remotest antiquity, and, to this day, the Kurds get the oil in what must have been the most ancient way of obtaining naphtha. There is usually a well, some 24 feet deep, in the shape of a funnel, the top being 15 to 30 feet wide and the bottom 10 feet. At the bottom is a wooden platform, giving access to two smaller wells, some 80 feet deep. In these wells salt water and naphtha collect. The wells are emptied every five or six days by means of a bucket. The salt water is turned into tanks for evaporation, and the salt is sold in Kasr-i-Shirin at 1 kran a batman. The crude oil, which fetches at the well 4 krans per 4 imperial gallons or tin (32 lbs. British), is taken to the still, which is now in Kerim Khan's village on the Kurretu River, the capacity of the still is only 70 imperial gallons. Out of one charge 35 gallons lamp oil are produced. This oil is sold at the still to the Kasr-i-Shirin Jews, at 71 to 8 krans per tin of 4 imperial gallons, and is resold in Kasr-i-Shirin at 10 krans a tin. NOTES ON THE PROVINCE OF KERMANSHAH. By Mr. de Morgan. ■ l In Kermanshah there is comparatively little snow, the cold season begins at the end of December and end of M arch. “ The valleys in summer preserve a beneficial humidity, on account of the mountains which surround them. The heat is never too great, and the nights remain cool. “ In the Kalhor country and the mountains situated between the right bank of the Gamasiab (Seimerreh) and the plain of Mahidasht, the climate is still milder, and the nomads find in the valleys well protected pasture whore snnw seldom: falls. In the summer on the contrary, they climb the highest mountain peaks in search of a cooler atmosphere. u The district of Zohab is very pleasant in winter, but very hot in, sum** mer. The plains near the Turkish frontier are practically uninhabitable in summer. “ In the lower parts of the Kalhor country the heat is also very great, but these regions being wooded, a certain coolness of atmosphere is maintain ed. This; applies- also to the Huleil&amp;n, Ballawa (Balavand), Mahidasht and Gamasiab valleys. “The province of Kermansliah is remarkable for its parallel plains and iB 9 S°tems, vftieh pearly all fellow a northwest awi south-east direction.169 Prom north-east to soutli-west the great ranges of mountains are: “ Kuh-i-Delakhani, lvuh-i-Parro, Ku'i-i-Hu^anek continued by Kuh-i- Scfi i and Kuli-i-Gelu, Kuh-i-Perkirmerz continued by Kuh-i-Bozan and Kuh-i-Sberek, Kubi-Oalahu and Kuli-i-Behlul (these two latter knowrf the ancients under the name of Zagros), and finally the Kalb or mountains, Noah-Kuh, Kuh-i-Somboleh, Kuh-i-Anurek, and Shah Kuh, which are situated at the Turkish frontier. “ Mount Dalahu is the highest mountain of the Province, and its summit is always snow-capped. Between these various mountain-ranges are usually extensive plains and valleys, where the greater part of the sedentary population of the province are settled. “ The country between Hamadanand Zohabis all mountainous, and forms’ part of the ranges bordering Iran, that is to say, the succession of peaks and valleys whh h allow one to pass from the heights of Hamadan (eleva- firm 1 S 7 m Ti ^ ^ ^ U A rv metres). This descent is gradual, and covers about 50 farsakhs (300 kilo- metres). The following Baghdad :— ire the elevations on the M etres. road from Hamadan to Metres.

The Turkish Customs together with the Regie hafe built from Hoorin and Sheikhan to Baghcheb, which is 3 farsakhs south of Kalleh Sabzi, eight towers, from which the frontier can easily be controlled. These towers known as Kishleh, although placed at spots arbitrarily chosen, are accepted as marking the frontier. South of Bagbcheh there are no towers, and the frontier between Saumar and Mendaliis formed by the Kumesang hills, but the Turks contest this and lay claim to the whole plain of Saumar. The tribes along the frontier are, from north to south, the Sharafbainis, Jafd Muradis, Bajlans, Gurans, Jaff-i-Pattfr-Beg, Sinjabis, Ahmadavands, Kalhors and Eivanis/'-- (Cesari, 1904.) The villages of the province of Kermanashah are, like all over Persia, either Khalesseh (Government property) or Tuyools (Government property granted for life to private individuals in lieu of pension^), or Milkiat (belong ing to private landlords), or Khurdeh Malek (belonging to the villager® themselves and divided up in small portions). According to the Government books, the taxation on land amounts to 72,000 tomans—but much more is in fact exacted. The Government taxes on land are according to an old kitabcheh, from rough estimates and surveys made 30 years ago. The result is that many flourishing villages have practically no taxes to pay, whilst others, now in ruin, are heavily burdened.170 The landowners have the following revenues : — On “ abi ° land one-third, sometimes one-fourth, of the harvest. On “ daim ^ land one-hfth of the harvest^ The landowners only supply the land and water, cattle and labour being furnished by the villagers. Proprietors also get a further 6 per cent on the portion of the harvest belonging to the villagers, they also get small per quisites on no definite scale, which vary according to agreement between villagers and proprietors. Some of the usual charges are on one pair of oxen or Sar juft: 1 toman and 2 or 3 loads of fuel or straw, or 1 mann rogan and 5 krans, or 1 lamb and 5 krans. Sometimes the perquisite is as small as 2 krans and 1 fowl, or J mann rogan. Villagers have also to supply labour free of charge, when their masters are building. When the landowner, over and above land and water, supplies seed and. oxen, the villagers only get one-fourth of the harvest. For gardens one-third of the produce goes to the proprietors. Most of the villages are inhabited by Lurs or Kurds, a Turkish popula tion is to be found at Sungor and in the village of Tavalabi, at the foot of the Parau Mountain. The province of Kermanshah is divided into 19 buluks or districts, which are as follows Kermanshah, Vastam, Mian Darbend or Bilavar, Push Parbend or Bala Darbend, Dinavar, Kuliai, £ahna, Kangavar, Assadabad, Hersin. Chamchamal, Dnru Faraman, Mahidasht, Harunabad, Guran, Kerind, Zohab, Aivan and Huleilan. For part of the following, I am greatly indebted to Dr. Oskar Mann, who not only very kindly collected all the information he could, but also verified on the spot the various information already in my possession. Other friends have helped me, but they prefer their names not to be mentioned. Buluk of Kermanshah .—The district of which the town of Kerman shah is the centre. The country, situated between half a farsakh and about 2 farsakhs from the town, is known as the Baladeh ; and is under the authority of Mah- mood Khan, chief of the Government grain stores. The Baladeh is said to contain some 20 villages and hamlets. The gorge to the south of Kermanshah, which is covered with gardens, is known as the Sarah; and is divided into Sarah Said, Sarah Hemmeteh and Sarah Kambar. Sarah numbers 500 families, under the jurisdiction of Sherif Khan, A min-ul- Mamalek. The villagers of the Kermanshah district have no pasture land, but give their cattle to Chupankeras, or the shepherd familes cf some of the tribes, to be taken to the pasture lands of the Hulailanis, for which a rent is paid.171 itnluJc of Vastam.—k. small district to the north o£ Ker mans hah, extend ing from Kaubendeh Saleh to Hajjiabai, and from the Karasu to Kinisht ^and the Parau Mountains. Tiiis district is practically entirely the property of Hajji Abdur Rahim, Vekil-ed-Dovvleb. Pairavanrh* —The Pairavands are divided into four branches : Dalujeh with 6 katkhorlas, Z &gt;yar with ’2 katkbodas. Kolkol with 4 katkhodas and Ruliai with 2 katkbodas. They number 400 bouses. They have no fixed Oaimsirs, some of them go to Pusht-i-Kuh, others tc the Sinjabi district. Of these 400 families about 70 or h0,and even more, do not go to Keshlaks. The others are settled in Kinisht and the surrounding villages. The leilaksof the Pairavands are in the Kuh-i-Parrao. The villages of Kaiakuin, Zalouab, Saraleh, Khalek and Kinisht are principally inhabited by the Paiwands. BuluJc of Mian Derbend. —This district extends from the district of Kermanshah to the province of Kurdistan, and to the districts of Kuiia and Pusht Derhend. The Governor is Mohamed Khan Ahmadavand, Path ul Mamalek. The inhabitants are mostlv Ahmadavand Behtui. The Mahal Zir Derband, which forms part of this buluk, is a plain, watered by the Ab-i-Razawar; and contains some 23 or 30 hamlets, averag ing from 10 to 30 bouses apiece, one of which is Kakiistan, a halting phice on the road to Senneh (Senenduj), some 16 miles irom Kermanshah. The district of Mian Dei bend is also called Bilavar. Buluk of Pusht-Derbend, also called Bala-Derbend, to the north of Kermanshah. Governor, NesruTah Khan of Diskeran. The population is eoinposed of Kuliais, Ahmadavand Behtuis and other Kurds. ' The Ahmadavand Behtuis, or more correctly Ahmadavand and Ahmal- avand Behtui, aie branches of the great Hamavand (Hamad in Jaid being the equivalent for Ahmad) tribe who inhabit Turkish territory ; a*.d are said to have, some 30 years ago, pillaged the frontier and even besieged Mend all. The Ahmadavand Behtui number about 400 houses, under the authority of Zahir ul Mulk Zengeneh. The chief of the tribe is Mohamed Khan, Path nl Mamalek. They furnish 100 horsemen to the Government. In summer they reside some 5 faxsakhs from town in hamlets, where they till their fields, and in winter they go to their Keshlaks near Kasr Shirin. The Ahmadavand Behtui are Shiahs. Buluk of Dinavar, —Governor, Khodadad Khan. A district containing some 50 hamlets. It is formed by a large plain, on the road from Kermanshah to Tabriz ; and' is entered by the Tang-i% Millehmass and ends at the Tang-i-Dinavar. Most of the hamlets belong to Azam ed Dowleh, a few to Mansoor es Saltaneh.172 There were formerly great rice-fields in this district, but, for the last three years, graat drought of water has prevailed. The inhabitants are very poor, and are descended from the Kuliai, Jelilawand, Mali and Nanekali, There are many ^ Jews, but of the old Armenian population not a family remains. Their village has preserved^ its name of Armenidjao, but its inhabitants are Mussulmans. Jelilav'tnd. —A small Kurdish tribe numbering some 200 to 300 houses. The Jelilavand are sedentary. Th«ir chiefs are—Kambar Ali Khan* Norooz Ali Khan, Majid ul Nizam, Pir Ali Khan and Khodadad Khan, either sons or relations of the late Ain Ali Kham The Jelilavands are^ Shiah. Mafi or Maafi {«&gt;., exempt of taxes). Formerly a large and powerful tribe of Kurds. Now quite dis persed. The Mafi, Jelilavand and Nanekali, when oppressed in KazviiF come to Kermanshah, and when oppressed in Kermanshah go to Kazvin. But as these tribes are very poor, many families during these peregrina tions have settled in villages belonging to other tribes, and thus it is that* they have dwindled down to their present reduced number. Mr. T. C. Plowden, in 1^81, speaks of some Mafi Kurds at Kalleh- Yavar, s r me 23 miles from Keonanshah on the road to Senneh ; and I 1 have beard of some 70 families of Mafi who reside near Zobab, but the' Mafi no longer, at least in the Kermanshah province, exist as a tribe. They are Shiahs. ^ Nanehali. —A tribe of Kurds residing in Mian and Fusht-Derhend. They are said to number 300 families, and supply 50 horsemen to the Gov-' eminent. They are under the authority of Zahir ul Mulk Zengeneh, and their chief is his son, Muktader us Sultan. They are sedentary and given to agriculture. Their villages lie some 6 farsakhs from Kermanshah. They are Shiahs. Kancluleh. —Although really part of Dinavar, this village is under the* direct jurisdiction of Zahir ul Mulk Zengeneh. It is Khalesseh (Govern ment property), but the taxes have been remitted, in exchange for the- expenses of the military contingent furnished by Kanduleh. It is the residence of one of the branches of Zengeneh tribe. Close by is Bozarud, a kalleh of Zahir ul Mulk, numbering 50 houses. The ele vation of Bozarud is Ijfill’^O metres. BuluJc of Kuhai.—ChAvi place, Sungur. Governor, Azam ed Dowleh, son of Zahir ul Mulk Zengeneh. u This district lies to the north and east of Kermanshah, and is bounded *» north by the province of Kurdistan; east by Assadabad; south by Dinavar and west by Pusht-i-Derbend. If commences at Gardakanu, and consists of two valleys ; that of the Gawa rud, undulating and bare, showing a few villages and large stretches of excellent corn land ; and thatof Shaju rud in which lies the town of Sungur, level, well watered, and covered with villao-es, gardens and plantations. There are said to be in this district, including hamlets, 153 villages, of which 20 have 100 houses and upwards. The average of the whole is about 30 houses. The people raise and export con siderable quantities of grain, chiefly to Hamadan and the barren tracts beyond.173 Porage and fuel are plentiful. The Kurdish nomads of the district, har ing the command of extensive pastures, rear large numbers of small, hardy horses and mules —[Captain Napier&gt; 1875.) Apart from grain a certain amount of cotton is yearly sown. The inhabi tants are mostly Kuliai. Sungur. —A flourishing agricultural town of 2,000 houses, 55 miles from Kerman shah, on the road to Tabriz. Its gardens extend to the skirts of the Dalakhana. A few carpets are manufacured here. Kuhai. —A tribe of Kurds who number about 4,000 families. Their chiefs are Aminullah Khan, Amin ul Lashkar and Haidar Ali Khan Sarfip. Their property amounts to some 1,000 hamlets, and extends up to -Assadabad on one side, and into the province of Kurdistan on the other. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Sungur, to whom they are answerable for the revenue. Mr. T. C. Plowden, who passed through Kermanshnh in 1881, tells us that this tribe was wealthy and prosperous, until ruined by the exactions of Ali Guli Mirza, Saram ed Dowleh, who. having been appointed by his father Imam Guli Mirza, Emad od Dowleh, “ Hakim of the Kuliai/' plundered them right and left. In former days the tribe furnished an infantry regiment, but, for some cause or other, the privilege was with drawn. The Soufiavand, who are connected with this tribe, and whose chief is Fathullah Khan, claimed to be Turkish subjects, but Persia had the ease ^decided in her favour. The Kuliais are Shiahs and are divided into a certain number of branches, known under the names of their respective chiefs. The two branches, which have names other than the names of their chiefs, are—the Faalahkurri, who number 200 families under Mir Mohammed Khan and Vali Khan, and the Soufiavand, who number 150 families. The net revenue of the Kuliai district was 17,000 tomans for the year 1*902. J Btdvk of Sakna. —This district can be divided into two distinct parts:— 1. Sahna and its immediate dependencies, which were formerly Kha- lesseh, but have been given in Tuyool to Vezir ed Daftar of Teheran and his descendants. The chief place is Sahna, long. 47° 38' 24' E.; elevation. 1,559*40 metres. It is a small but flourishing town, 37 miles east of Kermanshah, on the road from Kermanshah to Hamadan, between Bisutun and Kan- gavar. It is situated at the foot of a range of precipitous rocky hills, where there are some ancient caves. The caravanserai, built by the Hajji of Nirwan, is fast going to ruins. When Taylor and Ferrier visited Sahna, it was a flourishing place of 500 houses. Bozario, after the great famine, found only 100 families remaining. In Sahna are to be found a few Atishheghi Seyyeds of the Aliullahi sect. The town, which is surrounded by gardens, is said to contain at the present moment 20d houses.The expenditure as—Hak-ul Hukumeh, 750 krans; Takfifat, 400 krans ; Sarf-i-Tamir, 280 krans. Bululc of Her sin .—Chief place, Hersin. Governor, Shah Rukh Mirza, The district of Hersin contains many villages and a few nomad settle ments. The inhabitants are decendants of the Lekk tribe, who have become sedentary, and of whose sub-divisions nothing can now be learnt. The nomad Lekks, who inhabit during the summer the districts of Khaveh and Alishter, in Luristan, sometimes enter the district of Hersin. The following is a list of these Lekks :— 1 Dilfan inhabit Khaveh.— Kakawan : Tushmal Keremullah Khan, sartip. Their settlements are nearest to Hersin. Itiwan or Iwatiwand : Tushmal Sartip Khan. Mumawan: Tushmals, Nazar Ali Khan and Reza Guli Khan. Silseleh inhabit Alishter.—Hassanawan : Tushmal Seyyed Mehdi Khan. Yussufwan : Tushmal Mohamed Taghi Khan. Kerem Ali. Felekdinwan.

Notes on some of the villages of this district:— Hersin (elevation, 1,671*75 metres) numbers 500 houses. There is plenty of water and numerous gardens, the fruits of which are exported to Kermanshah. Very good gilims are manufactured in Hersin. Issakvan (named from an old Lekk tribe), 40 houses. On the road from Hersin to Garreban, 3 farsakhs from Hersin. The inhabitants are mostly Aliullahis. The inhabitants of Hersin usually, when they are young, enter the service of the Teheran Government officials, and thus are seldom oppressed by local Governors, as they can easily lay their complaints before the higher officials in Teheran. Buluh of Ckamc7iam,al.-—K district watered by the Gamasiab, and com posed of some 250 hamlets. It is situated to the east of Kermanshah, and extends from the village of Nazlian to that of Chehr. The chief place is Bisutum, the residence of Mirza Ali Khan, who is both Governor and chief of the road guards. The proprietors of this district are princes, mollahs and notables of Kermanshah, but most of the villages belong to Yekil ed Dowleh, Zahir ul Mulk and Azam ed Dowleh, the latter's son.) \ 176 The villagers are descended from various tribes, but are mostly Zenge- nehs and Zoulelis. Zouleh.*—A nomad tribe numbering some 1,000 houses ; and divided into eight branches, which are designated by the name of their respective kathodas. Their encampments extend from Chamchamal to Assadabad. In sum mer they till their fields ; in winter they go to the Keshlaks of the Kalhurs, Sinjabis and Aivanis, where, after renting pastures for their cattle, they settle for the cold season.

Ala*ed-Dowleh. The river Merik is spanned here by a fine brick bridge. The village of Mahidasht is under the authority of Katkhoda Selim. The plain of Mahidasht is some 10 miles in breadth and 70 miles in length; it is watered by numerous irrigation canals, kanats and by the river The plain is celebrated as one of the most productive tracts in Persia. It is said to furnish two-thirds of the grain supply for the town of Kermanshah, and its gram fetches 4 krans more per kharvar than that from other parts of the province. The plain of Mabidasbt numbers some 400 villages and hamlets, and is divided for revenue purposes into two parts: Mahidasht Zengeneh on the right bank of the Meiik and JMahidasht Kalhur on the left bank of that river. The population of Mahidasht Plain is said to he some fi,000 families, composed principally of Kalhurs, Zengenehs and Sinjabis. Most of the in habitants leave th^ir villages to join their tribes in the Keshlaks, near the frontier. They take with them their cattle, horses and the cattle and horses of those who remain. The yeilaks of the Sinjabis are in the mountains to the north of the plain. Some Kalhurs have their yeilaks to the south of the plain. Zengeneh.—A Kurdish tribe of Kermanshah, numbering some 2,500 families. The^’r chief is Mohamed Reza Khan Zahir-ul-Mulk, whose grandfather, Mustapha Guli Khan, was Governor of Kermanshah before Mohammed Ali Mirza. The Zengeneh are divided as follows :—Taifeh Kendouleh, Hassan Khan j Taifeh Namivand, Hajji Rustam Khan and Mehdi Khan Sultan; Taifeh Kerkuki, Ali Khan Sultan; Taifeh Chehri, Mohammed Taki Khan Yavar; Taifeh Shamshir Chubin, Mohammed Hassan Ilbeghi; and Taifeh Bahtyar- vand. The Kendoulehi and Chehri are sedentary at Kendouleh and Chehr. The other Zengeneh have their yeilaks in the plains of Mahidasht and Talandasht. Their Keshlaks are near Shirvan. By their mild and equitable rule, the family of Zahir-ul-Mulk have been able to keep the chiefship of the tribe for more than two centuries. The Zengeneh are known for their attachment to thei? ruling family, and are said to obey blindly any orders the latter may give them. Zahir-ul-Mulk, as sartip of the Zengeneh tribe and also of the Nanekali, Ahmadavend Behtui and Osmanavand, maintains one regiment of infantry (with a band) and 150 cavalry. Most of the Zengeneh country is milkiat, Kendouleh is Khalesseh. Not only does the Zengeneh country yield nothing to the State, for the land-revenue from it is absorbed in paying the expenses of the military con tingents supplied, but Zahir-ul-Mulk draws annually on the Kermanshah Government to balance his accounts. The Zengenehs are Shiahs.178 OsmanavancL—A small Lnr tribe* numbering some 400 bouses. It is under the authority of Zahir-ul-Mulk* to whose regiment it supplies a com pany of .100 meo. The Osmanavand have their yeilak near their village of Osmanavand, near the plain of Mahidasht. Their Kashlahs are in Huieilan, Toe Osmana* vands are Aiiullahis. Samereh.—'About 100 years ago* the Samereh Seyyeds left Bagdad and took refuge in the plain of Mahidasht. They number at present about 100 families* and have acquired some 30 to 40 hamlets in which they have settled. They also have in their keeping the villages, which Sheikh Ali Khan Zengeneh converted into whakf, for the benefit of pilgrims. The Seyyeds Samereh are Shiahs. In the plain of Kermanshah are also to be found small tribes,^ which have no importance whatever. Such are the Mahmoodvand of the Jaif-i-b atlabegi, the Turkanshavand, who number some 100 houses, and are also to be found sometimes in the Paran Mountains. In winter they buy pastures from one of the tribes* and settle there with their cattle for the cold season. The Sharahzubu a small tribe of 25 families* under the Zen gene b. The Khormavoi, a small tribe who came over from Luristan. Zouleh-Zengeoeh, a small tribe now forming part of the Zengeneh tribe. It supplies a few soldiers to one of the eight companies of the Zengeneb regi ment.

This latter tribe is known under the name of Zouleh-Mammoo, the former being called Zouleh*Zengeneh. Bahtiaravand.—The Bahtiaravand are a branch of the Sinjabis, but have severed their connection with the tribe.

Harunabad, which is called Harunieh by the Kurds, numbers 70 houses, and is built on the ruins of a town, said to have been built by Havun al Kashid. The Governor of the district is Daoud Khan Ilkhani* Saham-ul-Mamalek* who is also at present chief of the Kalhur tribe. The Deh nishins and Sahra nishinsare all Kalhors. •« ■179 The southern part of the plain of Harunabad is calhd Rawand dasht, or the plain of Hawand ; and is the summer quarters of most of the Kalhors. Kalhor.—The Kalhors are said to number in all, including sedentary population, close on 12,000 families. They are divided into 15 principal branches, each having a separate chief or kathoda. They furnish one regi ment to the Government, the expenses of which are deducted from the maliyat. This is the most powerful tribe in Kermansbah, and in case of need, or for their own purposes, the Kalhors are said to be able to muster up to 4,000 horsemen, all armed with imitation Martini and Peabody rifles. For two centuries the principal families were the Shahbazi or Hajjizadeh, Mohammed Ali Khani and Kazem Khani. The chiefs of the tribe were always chosen from the first two families mentioned, and Daoud Khan is the first exception to that rule. The Kalhors have their yeilaks distant 6 to 12 farsakhs from the town of Kerman shah. Their kes hi aks are to the north of the Turkish town of Mendali, and extend from the neighbourhood of that town to the borders of Kasr-i-Shiiin. Their landed property, yeilaks and keshlaks, is very fertile and produc tive, and they possess enormous stretches of “abi” land. Amongst their landed property is the plain of Gilan, which measures 4 by 6 farsakhs, and is watered by 60 irrigation canals; the plain of Kalleh Shahin e &gt;st of the Paikuli range lying between that range and that of Dukkan-i- Paoud These lands were purchased by the Kalhor chiefs from their Turkish proprietors about the beginning of last century. (Kalleh JShahin was included in the territory of the Kurdish chief of Dartang and Darnah, who at the time of the treaty of 1639, iu the reign of Murad IV of Turkey and Shah Safh of Persia, ruled over Zohab and the whole of the adjoining mountains.) Some others of their possessions are Direh, Shian, Kifrawar, Chelleh, the plain of Rawand, Shahini and Shuan, Mandirik, Kamazard, &amp;c., and a porlion of the great plain of Mahidasht. The tribe is said to possess in all some 700 villagesand hamlets, belonging to the Hajjizadeh and Mohammed Ali Khani clans. The Mohammed Ali Khani clan sold all its property to the late Hajji Aga Hassan, British agent, the father of the present Biitisli agent of Kermanshah, The Hajjizadehs, or Shahbazis, whose ancestors turned all their properly into whakfs in favour of their descendants (the property being consequently unsaleable), are still landed proprietors. The Kalhors are Shiahs. The land occupied by the Kalhors is Milkiyat. The Kalhors furnish one regiment, which has no band.182 Bululc of Chief place, Galiwareh, Governor, Hussein Khan, Mansoor ul Mulk The district of Guran is inhabited by the Guran tribe, whose territory extends from the plain of Mahidasht (east) to Harun Nishin Khan (north west), near Baneh. Kalleh Zenjir and Mount Dalahu are included in it. It ends east of the plain of Zohab. The Sharafbainis and Bajlans separate tire Gurans from the frontier. The present chief of the Gurans is Hussein Khan, Mansoor ul Mulk, Amir Toman, son of Assadullah Khan, who is both sartip and governor of the tribe and district, Mohamed Vali Khan, Khan Khanan, Mirpanj, son of Mansoor ul Mulk, by a Kadjar princess, is Naib ul Hukumeh, Some years ago the sultans of the tribe, at the instigation of Aga Seyyed Rustam, rebelled against Mansoor ul Mulk, who bad to spend large sums to induce them to submit to his authority again. From that time he has lost many of his properties, and the greater part of his authority and influence over the tribe. The Garans number from 4,000 to 5,000 families, of wdiieh about 2,500 'are “deh nishin” or “yeilaki,” i.t., sedentary, having settled in villages in the Guran territory ; whilst the remainder are “ garmsiri■ ,, or nomads, who go with their cattle in the plain of Zohab for the winter. The principal yeilak of the Gurans is the Mount Dalahu and its surroun dings, where they pass the summer. The Gurans are divided into six principal branches—(1) Gahwareh; (2) Baziani; (b) Niriji; (4) Kalkhani; (5) Bibiyani, or Buyani; (6) Kalleh Zairjiri; and JafH-Kader Murid Waissi and Jalf-i-Taishi, two small Ja£f tribes. The chiefs of the tribe are Shiahs. The first six branches are Aliullahis, and the Jaffs are Sunnis. These latter, who have settled in the plain of Sarkalleh, nmth of Zoha\ are Jaffs who have separated from the great Jaff Gibe of Suleimanieh. Mahmood Pasha, chief of the great Jaff tribe, has lately made great efforts to induce the Jaffs, who have jcined the Gurans, to return to his rule, and has threatened them with severe reprisals should they refuse. The Gurans furnish a regiment of infantry, divided into eight companies, each nominally 100 strong, with a sultan at the head of each. The regi ment has no band. The Bazianis form also the piivate escort of the Guran chief, and are sur- named tufangchiha. They inhabit the mountains to the north of Gahwareh. They are said to supply occasionally 100 horsemen for the service of the State, and to be able to turn out some 400 to 500 horsemen with Peabody- Martini rifles in case of need, but 1 have not been able to obtain accurate information on the subject. Part of the revenue of Guran is retained by the chiefs to defray the expenses of the regiment. In 1834, when British officers were attached to the Persian Army, Sir Henry Rawlinson raised a regiment of Gurans.The tribe is rich in sheep, goats and oxen, but has few horses and mares. Their land is milkiyat. Of this tribe, Sir Henry Rawlinson wrote as follows :-— ff Shortly after the time of Sultan Murad, the Kalin r tribe, which had been driven out of Dartung and Darnah, assumed to themselves the peculiar designation of Gurans, which had been previouly applied to the Kurdish peasantry as distinguished from the clans; and these Gurans, at the same time, broke into three distinct tribes of Kalleh Zanjiri, Kerindi andBiwaniji, the names being derived from their several places of residence. They are said, with the connivance of the Government of Kermanshah, to have driven the Bajilans out of Darnah in about the year 1700, and to have obliged the latter to confine themselves to the plains, in which, shortly afterwards, the Bajilan Pasha founded the town of Zohab.” From most minute inquiries and studies by Dr. Mann, it would appear that this district was in olden times inhabited by a sedentary population, who spoke the so-called tajik dialect of the interior of Persia. This population has been overpowered by the Kalhurs and Zengenehs, and thus formed a new tribe, under the name of Gurans. '1 he sedentary families of the Gurans have preserved their old language, whilst the nomad families speak the Kalhor and Zengeneh Kurdi. Notes on some of the villages of the Guran district Gahvyareh, the principal village of the Guran country, is situated on the other side of the Kala Kazi r mge, one stage north-east of Kerind and 40 miles west of Kermanshah It numbers 300 houses and was celebrated for its apples. Unfortunately the trees were destroyed by caterpillars. The peasants now cultivate tobacco, of which large quantities are exported to Kermanshah. Rough gilims are woven by the women and childern, and used exclusively by the tribe. The Guran women are said to turn out the best carpets of the province, but they now seldom make any. The elevation of Gahwareh is 1,507TO metres. Chiabur or Chegabur, near the road, at Milleh Amir Khan, which leads from Mahidasht to the Guran territory. Tushami, village of Aga Seyyed Rustam, one of the chiefs of the Aliullahis, is 1| farsakhs from Gahwareh, between that place and Biwanij. It is on the Zimkan River, which rises at Sar tang Biwanij, at about 1 farsakh from Tuehami, between that place and Biwanij. The elevation of Tushami is 1,633’25 metres. Kalleh Zanjir, the second chief place of the Guran tribe, on the north east brow of the Dalahu. Buluk of Kerind .—Chief place, Kerind. Governor, Nermatullah Khan, Saram ul Mamalek, son of Malek Niaz Khan and nephew of Air Murad Khan, Ehtesham ul Mumalek. The district of Kerind is composed of— (1) The plain of Kerind, in which are the town of Keiind and many villages, such as Harir and Khosroeabad. Kerind, lat. 34° IG 7 59 // N., long. 46° 14' E.; elevation, 5,500 feet (Gerard); is situated 56 miles west of Kermanshah, on the road from Kermanshah to Bagdad. It is described by Eraser as “ grotesquely, rather23E 184 tlian picturesquely, placed at the mouth of a gorge between two precipitous hills. The houses, though small, are neat and built in terraces on the slops or the gorge, with the naked and scarped rock rising abruptly above them. Rich gaidens extend up the defile, and along the Lase of the mountain, which produce a variety of fruits, including the celebrated stoneless grape, known as that of Kerind (Asghari grapes). Ihe willow and lofty poplar attain a considerable size on the margin of a mountain stream that bisects the yidage, which is afterwards turned off into smaller channels for the supply of the gardens in the plain. Several copious springs, issuing from the plain, which is here about 3 mdes broad, add their water to numerous mountain streams and form the sources of the Ab i-Kerind, the north west tributary of the Karkah riverA Kerind contains 1,200 houses. The people live by cultivation, and there is a brisk trade on account of the constant passage of pilgrims. The women weave some fine gilims. Cutlery, metal work and gnn making are the principal industries of the town. A rough imitation of the Peabody-Martini and Henry-Martini are manufactured here, and bought np by the tribesmen Mo cartridges are made here, but those imported, or smuggled through from Bagdad, are re capped by hand, and used over and over again till v, orn out. The inhabitants are all Aliullahis. (2) The plain of Biwanij contains 14 villages. The principal village is Sheikhan; elevation, 1,648 20 metres. Governor: Taber Khan, a rich landed proprietor, to whom belongs all the land between Rijab, Yaran and Zardeh. Then we have the following villages :— Walai (near the Gardaneh Baneban, which is situated between Tushami and Biwanij), Cbia Mirekeh, Sartang, Deh-i-Jami, Deh-i-Litfeh (Litfeh is the Kathoda's name), Deh-i-Ujak-Gidi (Ujakh Guli is the Katkhoda's name), Kanahar, Biameh, Mamali, Birrehshabi, Kurchibashi, Assiab Tanureh. In all about 400 houses. The Maliyat of the Biwanij district goes towards paying the expenses of two companies of the Kerind regiment. (3) Mountain villages such as Bijah (Riz-ab), elevation, 1,151*50 metres; 150 houses; plenty of gardens; maliyat, 450 tomans, which go towards paying the expenses of the band of the Kerind regiment. The villages cn the Tak-i-Gerra pass (Tak means arch, and Gerra is the name of one of Knosroe Parvize^s odicers) are :— Pai-Tak (PahTak-i Gerra, ?*.£., at the foot of the Tak-i-Gerra pass), lat. 34° 25' 12' K, long. 46° 12' 39' E. 20 houses. Pilgrims usually stop here, in order to avoid the village of Mian Tak, the inhabitants of which are very extortionate and have the reputation of charging 1 outrageous prices for fodder. Mian-Tak the middle of the Tak-i-Girra pass), called by the Kurds, Surkhadizeh ; 80 houses. There is here a large caravanserai m bad repair. The villagers, as already mentioned, are very exacting towards the pilgiims. Two or three of the villagers were hanged ; by order of Ala-ed-Dowleh, for molesting pilgrims.185 v Provisions are scarce and have to he brought from, long distances. Sar-i-Mil (Sar-i-Millen, i.e. } the top of the pass), also called Tur. 40 houses. .(4) The plain of Bishiveh, north of Sar-i-pol, between that place and Pai Tak. It is the keshlaks of the few nomads of the Keriod tribe and is 6 farsakhs distant from their yeilaks. This plain conteains many villages and rice fields. Kerindi.—A tribe of Kurds, mostly sedentary, inhabiting the district o Kerind. The tribe, inclusive of sedentary population, is said to number 4,000 families, some say 5.000. • They are divided as follows, the names being taken from the names of the principal village of the various settlements :— Name. Chief. Kerindi Nermatullah Khan. Biwaniji ... ,,, # # • Taher Khan Sultan. Bishiveh ... ,,, • • • &gt; • « Mehdi Guli Khan. Hariri M f • •• Ahmed Khan Mushref Surkhadizeh ... t • « Fazlullah Sultan. Reikhani t • • Mir Ali Sultan. Rashid Ali (nomad tribe) ... • • « Abbas Khan Sultan. Under the authority of the Kerind Governor is the Lnr trioe of* Jelala- yands, numbering 500 houses, and inhabiting the Huleilan district. The Kerindi supply an infantry regiment, composed of 8 companies, each nominally 100 strong, and a band. The Sartip of th* regiment is Ali Murad Khan, Ehtesham ul Mamal k formerly Governor of Kerind. The Kerindi, who are supposed to be a branch of the Gurans, are said to have bought Kerind from the Guran Chief of Kalleh Zanjir, some 140 years ago. The Kermdis and Jelalavands are Aliullahis, their chiefs are Shiahs, Buluk of Zohab .—The largest district of the province of Kermanshah, and formerly a pashalik under Turkish rule. This district is really under the authority of Mansoor ul Mulk, Amir Toman ; but Kalleh Sabzi and Kasr-i-Shinn are excluded from his rule and form a separate Governorship, which is now in the hands of Shir Khan, Samsam nl Mamalek. The Bajlans occupy the territory which extends from KasrT-Shirin (north) to the frontier. South of Kasr-i-Shirin, extending up to Lurisfan, are the ^ gnrmsirs of the Kalhors ; and nearer to Kasr-i-Shirin the garmsirs of the Sinjabis. . V186 Thfl plain of Zohab is practically deserted in summer. There are hut \illages, some of thpm, such as Bishkan, inhabited by Bajlans and ctlnrs; such as Zohab, inhabited by Jaffs. North of the plain of Zohab is the plain of Sarkalleh, which is the garmsir of the two branches of Jaffs, who are under the Gurans. (Rich speaks of a village named S srkalieh, 9 miles east of Zohab, but the plain has no village in it now ) North of this plain are the plains of Hoorin and Sheikhan, inhabited by Sharafbainis. These plains extend up to the frontier. The plain of Zohab is very well irrigated ; tbe greater part of it, up to Sar-i-pol, is turned into rice fields. The plain of Sarkdleh is no more under cultivation. The plains of Hoorin and Sheikhan are very well irrigated, and yield a large supply of grain and rice. The whole district is in constant fear of invasion by the Jaffs. .Against the Jaffs, Kader Aga Bajlan has a post of 50 horsemen at Bishkan, a kal leading from the north of the plain of Zohab to the plain of Sarkalleh. Aziz Beg Sharafbaini receives monetary subsidies from the Government of Kermanshah to maintain 100 horsemen, and Aziz Khan Bajlan is posted at Kuratu with 100 horsemen. Bajlan. The Bajlans under Persian nde barely number 200 families. .Fheii chiefs are Aziz Khan at Kuretu and Kader Aga at Bishkan. Kader Aga and Aziz Khan are constantly at feud, one with the other. Kader A^a s son was killed in March last. To prevent tbe freouent recurrence of fights and effusion of blood, the present Governor of Kermanshah has removed Kader Aga from Bishkan to Kuretu, thus separating the two rival families. The Bajlans are Sunnis. Shaiafbaini. d he Sharafbainis, whose chief is Aziz Beg (bis residence being at Hcorin), number some 1,000 families. They speak the Jaff dialect and are Sunnis. They are probably a branch of the great Jaff tribe. They say that they came from Mosul to Persia during the reign of the Saffavi monarchs. Sinjabi.—Under Shir Khan/ Samsam ul Mamalek. Their garmsirs are si mate between Kasr Shirin and the Turkish fr- ntier ; their yeilaks no:th ot Mahidasht plain. The real Sinjabis number barely 500 families, but, with other nomads who have joined them at a later period and with the se en ary population of their villages, their number is said to reach some- 1Emilies. They are of the Aliullahi persuasion. They supp y ) hoi semen to the Government. The Sin jabis are divided into : — Division. Sub-Divisions. Chief, Chalabi ,,, t • t • ft Chalabi Ellahi Khan.

Susmahi.—This tribe is now reduced to some 12 families, wbo are found at Sar-i-Pol in winter and in summer move about the plain of Diaavar. They have an artificial language of their own. Sar-i-Pol-i-Zohab (the head of the Zohab bridge) usually known as Sar-i- Pol. —A village of 60 houses, with a caravanserai on the right bank of the Hoi wan, 29 miles from Kerind. There is a telegraph office here. Sheikhan.—A vilias'e 20 mib s north of Zohab. It is composed of three or four hamlets, the most important one being situated at the mouth of a mountain gorge. The others are higher up in the mountain. Its name is derived from two Sunni saints whose tomb* are here (these, surmounted by their white cupolas and embosomed in orchards, form a very picturesque object). Sheikhan numbers, all told, 100 houses. Close by are some ancient sculptures. Piran, Yaran and Zardeh.—In the mountains to the north of the road to Zohab. Yaran : population, Jaffs ; religion, Sunni ; maliyat, 70 tomans. Zardeh : population, Aliullahi language, Kandulei. Baba Yadgar-i-Hussein, one hour from Zardeh. Imamzadeh, two houses. The re are always many pilgrims and people in refuge here. Elevation, IjIOb'So metres. Kalleh Sabzi : Persian frontier post, on the road between Kasr-i-Shirin and Khanikin, numbers about 10 houses, under the son of Shir Khan, Samsam ul Mamalek. Kasr-i-Shiiin. Latitude 34° 30'6 V N. Elevation 2,130 feet (Rozario). X village situated on toe right hank of the Hoi wan river. It has some 100 houses and a bazaar with 30 sh&lt; ps. Provisions are plentiful. Here are a telegraph office and a custom-house The place of late years has been greatly improved. The Petroleum Company, who are working at 3 far- s ikhs distance, have had houses built for their staff in Kasr-i-Shirin. The Government House is built of stone, on a hdl to the south-west of the town, and is meant as a stronghold in case of attack. Kasr-LShirin is 103 miles distant from Kermanshah. Zohab. Latitude 34° 35' 22' N.~A small village of some 30 houses, situated on the ruins of an extensive town. Of this place Sir H. Rawlinson, writing some 50 years ago, said : “ The town of Zohab was built 100 years ago by a Turkish pasha, and the Government continued to be hereditary in his family, till the conquest of the Pashalik by the Persians. The capital was surrounded by a mud wall, and may have at first con ained about 1,000 houses. From it£ frontier position it has been exposed to constant spolia tion in the wars between Turkey and Persia, and is now a mass of ruins, with scarcely 200 inhabited houses.' The Persians say that during the war under Mohammed Ali Mirza, Zohab furnished to the Turks 1,000 horsemen, clad in chain armour. Of the district of Zohab Rawlinson said : “ It is bounded on the^ north west by the course of the river Biala/on the east by the mountains, and on the south by the stream of Hoi wan. It formed onk of the 10 pashaliks188 dependent upon Bagdad, until about 60 years ago, when Mu bammed Alt r Mirza, Prince of Kerman^bab, annexed it to the crown of Persia. By the treaty concluded between Persia and the Porte in 1823, it was stipulated that the district^, acquired by either party during the war, should be respec tively surrendered and that the ancient frontier line should be restored, which had been established in the time of the Safavi monarchs. According •to a subsequent treaty, Zohab ought certain'y to have been given up to the Turkish authorities, but Persia had neither the wdl to render this act of justice, nor hud the Pasha of Bagdad the power to enforce it ; and Zohab, although still claimed by the i oite, has thus remained to the present day in possession of the Government of Kermanshah. “ Zohab, having been acquired in war, is Khalesseh, or crown land ; it has been usually farmed by the Government of Kermanshah at an annual rent ... to the Chief of the Guran tribe, whose hardy Ilayats inhabit the adjoining mountains. . . .-The amount of the revenue must depend, in a great measure, upon the value of rice and corn, its staple articles of produce ; but in years of {denty, when the prije of these commod ties is at the lowest possible rate, a considerable surplus will still remain in the hands of the lessee. The revenue system of this district is simple, and more favourable to the cultivators than in most parts of Persia. It is thought derogatory to tlie chief to take any part of the cultivation int &gt; his own immediate hands. He distributes grain to his dependents, and at the harvest receives as his share of the produce two-thirds of the rice and corn; in consequence of the water consumed in its irrigation, which is the propertv of the landlord or of Government, and is rarely to be obtained without considerable expense and labour. “ Tne rice grounds of Zobab are chiefly irrigated by an artificial canal brought from the Holwan river, a distance of about 10 miles. The canal is said to have been an ancient work, but was repaired and rendered avail able for its presont purposes only loO years ago by the same Pasha, who subsequently built the town of Zohab. ' The revenue accruing to the chief averaged 10,000 tomans. o ‘ ^ aw * inson es ^bmated the produce of the district of 2,000 kharvars of rice and at 2,500 kharvars of wheat. Zohab at Unaer the lumsh ru ] e Zohab yielded, with its dependents an annual sura of oO,&lt;h 0 tomans, but it then included several fertile and . extensive districts, wh|ch are now detached from it, and there were also above 2,000 raiyats resident upon the land ; whereas, at present tH. n 7 18 reduced to about 300 families, and the great proportion of f i u ber i. % «. hand, of Goran Ilyats, who, move up to their summer pastures among the mountains oh W 1 f ’ a few labourers in the plain to get in the°cro P s.

The Ahmadavand Chalabi were claimed by the Pasha of Bagdad as Turkish subjects, and after the death ot‘ Jan Mir Khan they crossed the frontier and settled in Turkish territory. A son of Jan Mir Khan was in Kermanshah a few months ago, but was politely asked by the Governor of Kermanshah to go and rejoin his tribe. Balulc of Aivan ,—A large district which borders on Luristan towards the south, and on the Turkish town of Mendali to the west. Governor, Hedayetullah Khan Sartip. This district is inhabited by the Aivanis, a tribe very closely connected to the Kalhors, who are said years ago to have been under their authority. They number some 2,000 families. They are cultivators, and have a certain amount of cattle. They pay 2,200 tomans maliyat per annum, and furnish no military contingent. Their present chiefs are Ahmad Khan, Ammanullah Khan and Hedayetullah Khan. Their territory extends up to Kumesang, near Mendali. The Ab-i-Gangir, which supplies the town of Mendali, has its source near Soumar in the Aivan district. The inhabitants of Mendali pay the Aivanis 100 to 150 tomans per annum, in return for the use of the water. The small district of Harasam, which nominally forms part of the Aivan district, is inhabited by the so-called Harasami, descendants of settlers who migrated here from Kermanshah. They number some 200 families. Buluk of Huleilan .—A tract of country 35 to 40 miles south of Kermanshah, bounded on the east by the Pish Kuh Luristan, north by the small district of H^rasam and west by Bijawand. It is under the governor ship of Ali Eeza Khan Mirpanj, son of the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh. It is inhabited by Lur tribes, known under the general designation of Huleilanis, and divided as follows :—Dajiwand, 200 families ; Balawand, 300 families ; Surkhameri, 200 families ; under the authority of Ali Reza Khan, son of H ussein Guli Khan Sarhang. Although the district is part of the province of Kermanshah, the tribes and land belong to the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh. The Osmanavand and Jelalaland, the former having their Yeilaks in Mahidasht, under the authority of Zahir ul Mulk Zengeneh, to whose regiment they supply a contingent; the latter furnishing a contin gent to the Kerind regiment and have their Keshlaks in Huleilan. The Chupankeras of various tribes, to whom the Kermanshah villagers give the keeping of their cattle for the cold season, come here for the winter and rent pasture land from the Huleilan tribesmen.191 In all about 60,000 families : at five persons per family, 300,000 inhabi tants. Some people mention the population as 350,000, but it must be borne in mind that this is only an approximation, as it is very difficult to get at exact figures in Persia. The tribesmen will always return their tribe at a lower figure, as they are afraid that the taxes may be levied for a larger number of families if they were to give an exact figure, which is even for them very difficult to get at. The nomad Kurds in winter have little to do in their villages or settle ments. They gather in the largest tent or house of the settlement, and there, surrounded by camels and cows, they listen to their mallat, or learned one, who reads out to them Kurdish poems. The Kurdish literature dates some 300 years hack. Some families in each tribe or settlement are known as Chupankera or Galladar («.&lt;?., shepherds), Assalbor (i e., honey gatherers), &amp;c., and these names are often erroneously given as names of branches of tribes. Before ending I must say a word on the Kauli or Kalbirband (sieve makers), who are to be found sometimes in the province of Kerman shah. They are to he found in Turkey, Afghanhtan, Kurdistan, &amp;c. In Turkey they are known under the name of Chinganah (Zigana), in other places they are known as Karachis. u They are despised as being unclean and filthy beyond power of description. Its members are considered capable of any iniquity. They appear to have little or no religion. Their marriages fake place without any special ceremony. They have no scruples about food or drink. They wander all over the country and appear to resem ble gipsies in their manners and customs. 5 '— (T. C\ Plowden, IbSl.) Army and Arsenal, The nominal strength of the army of the province of Kermanshah is four regiments of SOU men each and 150 artillerymen, and some 400 to 500 irre gular cavalry. The regiments are— Kalhor : chief of regiment, Mohamed AH Khan ; colonel, Samsatn es Sultan Mirpanj, nephew of Mohamed All Khan. Kerind : chief of regiment, Ali Murad Khan, Ehtesham ul Mamalek. Guran : chief of regiment, Hussein K! lan, Mansoor ul I\iu!k. Zengeneh : chief of regiment, Mchamed lleza Khan Zengenth, Zahir ul Mulk. The artillery is under the Zahir ul Mulk. Further information as to the composition of these regiments will be found in the chapters dealing with tribes. The following is the irregular cavalry paid for by the Govern ment :— Number. Sinjabi • •• • • i • M • •• 200 Ahmadavend • • • • •• • •• 150 Nanekali ••• • •• • •• 50 Sbarafbami ... t • • • ft • •• 100 Bajlan •« « • ft • ft • • • 150192 It is only oE late tliat tlie Bajlans and Sharafbainis have been suosidised by the Government for the keep of their sowats. The number of sowars to be furnished by the Iribes, and the tribes from which they have to be furnished, are questions settled bj the Governor of Kermaushah, and altered at nis will. There is always in Kermanshah a regiment, which is not from the province, garrisoned in the town. It is rare to find more than 500 soldiers under arms. They are armed with Werndl rifles which they have to return to the arsenal when disbanded. The arsenal is said to have 700 Werndl rifles. All the guns are now on the artillery square and number 16, of which two are Austrian breech loaders, 9 centims ; two Austrian breech-loading mule guns 7 centims; and four Austrian 6-pounders, muzzle-loading, made in leheran, ad with full accessories ; also 10 old muzzle-loaders of various sizes, mounted ; 20 old muzzle loaders, of various ^sizes in the arsenal; two mortars, one of which is mounted on a gun carriage. Koad Guards.—A few road guards are furnished b}' some of the villages on the mad to Bagdad and that to Ramadan. They are armed with Martini-Henry rifles. The following is a list I was given of the forces the respective tribes caji turn out in case of need :— Number.

At Sar-i-PoM-Zoliab there are three old muzzle-loaders, with a few rounds of amir.u ifcion.Government Revenue and Expenditure* To get accurate information on the revenue and expenditure of a province in Persia is a very difficult thing indeed. The land revenue of the province of Kermanshah is fixed at 72,000 tomans, whilst with other revenue it is said to approach 100,000 tomans. This constitutes the Asl or amounts to be collected according to the Government books. The Farkh is the amount which is collected, and of this amount one can only make con jectures. A large part of the revenue is kept hack by the tribes and villages against the expenses of the military contingents they supply. The table expenses and expenses for the reception of pilgrims of distinc tion, and of the chiefs of tribes, are disbursed by the Governor himself. The expenditure under this heading is said to amount to from 12,000 to 20,000 tomans per annum, I have been assured that for some years past a claim of 30,000 tomans has been made yearly by the Governor pro tern, on the Treasury in Teheran, in order to balance accounts* With a proper system of taxation and of collection of revenues, and the free exportation of grain to Bagdad, this province could have a large surplus revenue to remit to the capital. KERMANSHAH— TOWN OF KERMANSHAH— Kermanshah, in official papers a Dar-ed-Dowleh Kermanshaban”. The name Kermanshahan is now quite obsolete, Kermanshah being used Kennaashah. to designate both the town and the province. “Locally, Kermanshah is the name given to the province ; Kermanshahan to its capital. By Europeans both are commonly called Kermanshah”. — (Curzon.) The longitude of Kermanshah is given as 46° 37' 0' E. by Rosario, and Longitude. 46° 59' 24' by Floyer. The latitude is variously quoted as 34°26' 0' N. by Macdonald Kinneir, Latitude. 34° 18' 45 // by Rosario, and 34° lO 7 14' 7 by Floyer. The elevation of Kermanshah according to Rosario is 5,140 feet. Dr. Oskar Mann made it to be 1,514 metres; the differ- Elevahon. ence between these figures may be accounted for if one takes into consideration that part of the town is built on a hill. Kermanshah* is the capital of the province of Kermanshah, and stands on rolling ground connected with the hills of Fath Ali Khan, Chiascrkh and Kamarzard, which form part of the limits of the Kermanshah plain. Chiasorkh, which is covered * “ The town is remarkable for no conspicuous buildings nor outward signs of wealth. It is as usual a collection of single storeyed, mud brick bouses, with narrow winding streets and commodious bazaar, but relieved from utter insignificance by its situation on the eastern slope of one of the low spurs of a great mountain range that extends far into Luristan on the south. Four miles to the east, across the valley of the Karasu, the Bisutun range rises up sheer and rugged to a height of 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the town, which is itself nearly 5,0C0 feet above the sea. The climate is exceedingly cold in winter, not unlike that of England in spring, and unpleasantly hot for only two months in the summer, when the inhabitants retire as much as possible to the pretty gardens and orchards, which lie a little further up the slope the south of the town.” (H. J. Wigbain, “Morning Post/' July il, 1902.)194 with small huts, inhabited by the lower Kurdish population, maihs the end of the town towards the south and the beginning of those fine gardens which give the town such a picturesque aspect, when leached from the Bagdad highway. There is also a hill in the town known as “ Teppeh Alaf Khan eh ” or “ Sarteppeh.^ The town, approached from the Hamad an road, presents a mean appear ance and is quite denmled of any relieving feature. A few tin-covered min: rets, the Naghareh Khaneh and the whitewashed walls enclosing the Governor’s palace, are the only signs which point to a town instead of a large village. “ The plain, on which the city stands, extends 6 miles in breadth from north to south and 30 miles from east to west ; it is studded with small villages containing 30 to 50 houses; to the north the plain is shut in by the Bar an range of mountains, which terminates abruptly at the village of Behistan (Bisutun), distant about 20 miles from Kermanshah .”—(Gazetteer of Persia, 1885.)* The circumference of the towm is about 8,150 paces or 6,775 metres, a walk of II hour. The ancient fortifications of the town w^re built in 1723, after the town bad fallen into the hands of Nadir Shah. Mohammed AH Mirza, Dowlet Shah, in the time of Fath AH Shah, surrounded the town by walls, flanked with loop-holed towers, and by a moat of 3 miles circumference ; this has now completely disappeared, and not a single trace of the walls can be seen unless it be one or two towers, now forming part of the houses of the poorer inhabitants. The town had five gates, known as Darvaseh Kaleskeh, Tnwn p^fpc Teheran road, Darvaseh Kassab Khaneh the Teheran road, Darvaseh Yahoodiha , the Teheran road, Darvaseh Sarah ; leading to Mahidasht, and Chiasorkh or Sar Kahr Aga ; leading to the Bagdad road. leading to the leading to to Darvaseh leading The gates do not exist now, but the names have remained and are used to indicate the principal entrances to the town. Kermanshah is now an absolutely open town. One of the entrances, leading to the Mesjid Emad-ed-Dowleh, is called the Darvaseh Shah Nejef but it is not known if this was formerly the gate for pilgrims going to Nejef and Kerbela, or if it got its name from the fact that Mohammed Ali Mirza had new gates made for Nejef, and had the old ones brought to Kermanshah and put up at this spot. Kermanshah, which has hitherto been described as a town half in ruins, T , t has, for some years, and especially since the arrival of the new Governor, Ala-ed-Dowleh, somewhi'.t changed its appearance. All the bazaars have had to be repaired under threats to the owners of severe punishment; and the Government buildings, such as * “ Kermanshah is 250 miles south-west of Teheran, 252 miles west north-west of Isfahan, 120 miles north east of Bagdad, 303 milessouth south-east of Tabriz by Sinna and 380 miles by Zeajan,” Charvadais say : - Kerma-sbah to Khanikin, 34 farsakhs, and Khanikin to Bagdad, 27 farsakhs; Kermanshah to Hamadan, 26 farsakhs; Kermanshah to Kurdistan, viz., Senneh (Peneudej), 23 farsakbs; Kermanshah to Sulianabad, 44 farsakhs.the Governor’s palace, artillery square and barracks have all been in proper order again. 1 Deen P 1 ** 4 don^s or sixths of the town of Kermansbab, then merelv a Jelonyed to a ceilam A’ali Baloo Beg Zengeoeh, who, in the 7 year ifiO A.

The goods to be found here are all of every day use ; this is no place for finding curios, &amp;c. The principal bazaar is the one which starts from the Meidan Toop Khaneh (artillery square) and goes up to the Darvaseh Sar Kabr Aga. The further end of this bazaar is named the Bazaar Alaf Khaneh ; other bazaars are Bazaar Basteh Bajab Ali Khan, Bazaar^ Basteh Chal Uassan Khan, Bazaz Khaneh Emadieh, Bazaz Khaneh Shahi. There are two sorts of caravanserais in Kernoanshah, the one for the use of pilgrims and caravans and the other for the mer- Caravanserais. chants. Of the first sort it is impossible to get a clear estimate of the number, as they are scattered about all over the town, and many private houses are used as such when there is a great number of pilgrims in the town. Of .the second sort the^ principal one, and the one where the most important merchants have their offices, is the Caravanserai Veki 1 -ed-Dowleh Then come the caravanserais Isfahaniha, Post-Khaneh, Favrash Bashi, Gomreek, Emad-ed-Dowleh and Hajji Moin. There are about 30 public baths, of which five or six are of a higher standard, but they are not made great use of by the Public baths. working classes, who, not being of the Shiah persua sion, do not attach so great an importance to bathing.

The Shiah religion has only been predominant here since the time of Nadir Shah and the Kadjars. The oldest mosque is the one called the Mesjid Jumeh, which was built by the grandfather of the present Zahir-ul-Mulk. There are three schools, where, apart from Persian, some notions of French, , , English, geography and mathematics are taught, gchools and mattabkhanehs. Thpge are _ the school of Hussein Ali Khan, the school of Kashe Mooshi and the Madresseh Xslamieh (Sheikh Mohamed Said). The charge is 10 to 30 krans per month per pupil, except the school ^ ot Kashe Mooshi which is free, it being provided for by the American Mission of Hamadan. There are also a few Maktab Khanehs, where the elements of reading and writing are taught, and where a charge of | to 2 krans per month per pupil is made, but the natives do not avail themselves of these opportunities, and I am told that fully twenty-nine-thirtieths of the population are totally illiterate. * fe The important mosques of the town are—The Mesjid Jumeh, the shabestaui (covered in part) built by Hajji Ali Khan Zmgeneh and the tabistani (open part) by Mohab AH Khan • the Mesjid and Madresseh of Hajji Sbabaz Khan; the Mesjid of Nawab^ Alieh (Princess), sister of Mohamed AliMirza and wife of Zein-el-Abedin Khan, son of Hussein Guli Khan Kadjar, and the mosque lately built by Emad-ed-Dowleh, which has some fine structures and a large clock which chimes the hours, day and night.” (Nasr-ed-Dm Shah, “ Journey to K Other* mosques are the following : Mesjid Shahzadeh, Sheikh, Hajji Khallil, Motamed, Alaf- Kbadeb, Giveh-Keshkha, Aga Rahim and Aga Abul Gassem,197 As an exception to what is generally seen in Persia, there are no ceme- Cemetcries and imamzadebs. t ^ ries ^side the town of Kermanshah. Outside the town there are two large ones, 1 he Kabr Aga and the Kabr Feizabad or Teppeh Gazi beg, which, however, have nothin^ of interest. There are no imamzadehs in or near Kermanshah; there is only a small mined arch, the remains of a small cupola built over a tomb, which is said to be the tomb of Seyyed Fatmeh, a female attendant of Fatmeh-el- Massoumeh, vvho died hereon her way to Korn. Under the arch are two tombstones with old Kufic inscriptions, but so effaced that it is now quite impossible to decipher them. 1 here is also, at farsakhs from town, near Kinisht, a village called Pir Gheib or Pir Khabir, but if ther- ever existed at this spot the tomb of one of the descendants of the Imams it has now completely disappeared. Kermanshah owes the buildings which can now be seen (either in faiilv Public buildings. £? 0( ^ C0n ^ition or m complete ruin) to the munificence oi two of it K sad jar (Governors—Mohamed All Mirza, Dowlet Shah and Imam Gull Murza, Emad-ed-Uowleh, son of Uowlet Shah.* The former built the Chahar-bagh, the town walls, the Governor’s palace, the artillery and the barrack squares, the villa of Dilkusha and the arsenal : the latter the mosque of Emaded Dowleh, the Post Khaneh, Emadieh, and the Kaisarieh part of the bazaars. Two other buildings of public interest are the Pol Karasu and the Gisr at Vekilieh. AlThe Chahar Bagh, known also as Bagh Shahzdeh and Bagh Mohammed i Mirza, is near the barracks ; a garden planted in imitation of the Chahar bagh of Isfahan. It had a large building or reception place called Tallar, the upper part of which was covered with tiles of no great value. This building is fast going to ruin. As for the fine garden, where water once flowed through numerous watercourses, it is now quite desolate, and the big plane trees, so rare in this district, were mostly cut down under the pretext of building barracks there, whilst the remainder have lately been sacrificed for the purpose of making carriages for some antiquated guns recently unearthed from oblivion in the arsenal. Hie town walls ^ already mentioned, the town walls are no more to be seen. The Government buildings of this town are—The building and garden of the late Mohamed Alt Mirza,the Kalleh Hajji Kerim, known as Dil kasha, the buildings of which were renewed and repaired by Emad-ed-Dowleh ; the large Divan Khaneh (Hall of Justice), the ent rance to which gives on the artillery square ; the Emarat Kashkul (oblong building), attached to the Divan Khaneh ; the large Andtrun (women’s quarter), attached to the Emarat Kashkul ; the Emarat Bidistan close by ; the Emarat Kalth (towers), between the Andarun and Archaine ; the Emarat Archaine (tank room) behind the Divan Khaneh ; the stables, the private apartments between the Emarat Kashkul and the Divan Khaneh (the Divan Khaneh Emarat Kashkul, Emarat Anderun, Emarat Bidistan, Emarat Kakh, Emarat Archaine stables and Khalvat (private apa»t- ments) form part of the Governor’s palace) ; the Arsenal, to the south of the Bagh Shahzdeh ; the Chappar Khaneh, behin d the said garden ; the Maidan Sarbaz Khaneh (barrack square) to the south of the Governor’s palace ; the artillery square, which is really the front court of the Governor’s palace ; the Government prison, to the south of the Divan Khaneh, and the Neghareh Khaneh, to the south of the artillery square;” (Kasr-ed-Diu Shah, “ Journey to Kerbela.”)The mosque of Emad-ed-Dcwleh is said to be in very good repair.

In spring it is quite impossible to ford this river . , . The other side of the river the plain extends up to Kermanshah, of which town one has from here a very fine view. Towards the Anderun (women's apartments) there is a large garden, with tanks and plenty of water, extending up to the gate at the opposite end. The Anderun is well proportioned, has many rooms and is a fine building. It has a fine Hammarn (bath). I visited the building ; the eunuchs and servants of the harem have separate apartments. The Biruni (reception rooms) is a fine three-storeyed building on the bank of the K arasu. It has a fine reception room giving on either side, bat as it is situated to the west, from four hours before sunset till sunset the rooms are exposed to the sun.' ; (Nasr-ed-Din Shah, “ Journey to Kerbela.') The heirs of Emad-ed-Dowleh preferred seeing this splendid property go to ruin rather than have to face the expense of entertaining for many days any new Governor who thought it his right to put up here before entering Kermanshah, and whose expenses, as well as those of his suite, had consequently to be defrayed by the proprietors.

The villa which belongs to Vekil-ed-Dowleh consists on the ground floor of a large vault under which there is a small tank from which in winter and spring great volumes of water gush out and flow into two large reservoirs, each measuring 121 paces square. The scene is very picturesque when the reservoirs are full, but very desolate in summer when they are empty. Emad-ed-Dowleh had steps cut in the rock leading over the arches containing’the sculptures. Pol Karasu bridge consists of six arches, and is very strongly built and kept in good condition. The whole structure is of burnt bricks. It was built by a certain Sheikh Ah Khan, once Prime Minister under one of the Saffavi monarchs and an ancestor of the present Zahir-ul-Mulk. The bridge is on the highway between Kermanshah and Bisutun at 1 farsakh from the former and 5 farsakhs from the latter. Jisr Yekilieh. Jisr Yekilieh is a small suspension bridge of very primitive construction, erected by the present Vekil-ed-Dowleh (the plan was supplied by Mr. J. De Morgan). It replaces a muddy box hauled on a rope * in which people were ferried over the Karasu at this spot and shortens the road to Yekilieh and Tak-i-Bostan. The Governor has prohibited vehicles going over it and it is with difficulty that horses occasionally pass. In winter one has to go all the way round by the Pol Karasu. Pol Khosroe is a little to the east of Yekilieh. A strongly built bridge of which there only remain the lower parts of the piers which are still intact.

If we admit that Aermanshab was for merly quite near Ibk-i-Bo^an, this bridge was then on the road from the town to Kasr-i-Shirim There are many fine gradens to the south of the town near Sarah and a few to the north, but at a certain distance. Ihere are Gardens. p] en ty of fruit trees and poplars, but unfortunately such a great quantity of wood is cut down every year that few trees are allowed to grow to their full height.

It is a favourite resort in spring for the people of Kerroanshab. There is an ample supply of water in Kermanshah, but it is as a rule heavy and indigestible. Drinking water is got from Sarab, a spring which waters the greater part of the gardens to the south of the town, Chashmeh Ibrahim Zahir, Chash- meh Sineh Guleh Zard. Water for the tanks in the houses is got from Kanat Agaai, Ab Djaba Khaneh, Ab Do evict Khaneh, Nahr Mehdi Khani. Although the Karasu flows across the plain of Kerman shah, its water is Karasu. no ^ use( ^ ^ or hrigafion. The levels are not very favour able, and although irrigation works could easily be made, water is so easily got from the mountains that nobody has yet been found to attempt any irrigation works. A legend says that the river sank horror stricken when Khosroe (some say Yezdijrd) threw the prophets letter into its waters. A small river named Ab-i-Ashuran formed by the various springs of Sarab south of the town of Kerman shah flows through the town and joins the Karasu near the village of Chega Gulan. Its water is polluted the town sewers. During the summer its water is turned off for cultivation. The water-supply in Kermanshah is plentiful, but as the water runs from Public health. one ^ 0l »se to that of the next, and as in these tanks the cooking utensils and borne linen are washed, the water generally used for diinking purposes is polluted and contaminated.

The line consists of a single wire. Messages can be sent to Teheran, Khanekin and Bagdad in Latin characters, but for other stations the language of the country has to be used. For the interior the charge is 2*75 krans per 10 words, for Bagdad 4 05 krans per word. On delivery of a telegram the farrash of the telegraph office claims 10 shah is. It is usually preferable to send telegrams for Europe to Teheran to be re- tr; msmitted from there, as messages through the Turkish lines are so mutil ated in transmission that they are usually incomprehensible when received. The director of the telegraph office at Kermanshah is Prince Bashir-ed- Dowleh. The administration of the post office having been made over to the Custom house and post custom-house officials, the post officers now in the o sice. custom-house caravanserai on the outskirts or the town to the north. The mails leave for Hamadan and Teheran on Mondays and Thursdays, and for Bagdad on Wednesdays. They are received from Teheran on Saturdays and Wednesdays, and from Bagdad on Sundays. There is also a mail to Hersin which leaves Kermanshah on Wednesday ; the mail from Hersin is received on the Tuesday. The Teheran post takes seven days to cov&lt; r the distance from Teheran to Kfrmanshah, and the Bagdad post four days from Bagdad to Kermanshah.

The G overnment of Kerman shah, like the government of nearly every other great town in Persia, consists of the following overnmen officials (1) Governor; (2) Naib Hokomeh (Deputy Governor) ; (3) Reis Daffar or Yezir Maleyat (accountant and staff); (4) Mconshi Bashi (secretary and staff) ; (5) Lashkar Nevis (army accountant and staff) ; (6) Reis Otakh Tahkikat (justice); (7) Reis Tujarat (com merce) : (8 i Farrash Bashi; (9) Ardel Bashi; (10) Kichikchi Bashi; (11) Tufangdar Basbi; (12) GuDr Agassi Bashi; (13) Sandukdar; (14) Shater Bashi; (15) Kalantar; (16) Katkhodas and Darugheh-i-Bazar.

The Consulate is said to have a Wire Consu at e-Gen era ^ revenue from passport service, and from the passes for taking dead bodies to Kerbela.

Mr. Brown, who made a report for the Bank of ^Persia ^ two years ago, reckoned the fixed population at 30,000, but he was on the cautious side in ail his estimates. The D.rector of Customs, who is in the best position to arrive at the true figures, puts the fixed population at 50,000, with a large floating population S ’ w ^hch during half the year may increase the total by more than 10 per cent. ,, (II. J, Whiglum, “ Morning Post,” July 11,1902.)204 inhabitants, T do not hesitate in putting down the population at 60,000, and think it is more likely to be slightly over than under this figure. It must be taken into consideration that the Kurds live huddled together in an incredible way. Ten Kurds put up in a mud house consisting of three small rooms, and it is said that in no town in Persia are tlmre so many inmates to a house. Nasr-ed Din Shah was well aware of this fact when he wrote.: “The town of Kerman shah has 7,(‘00 houses,” and further, “ the inhabitants of this town aie a mixture of Kalhurs, Zengeneh^, a f«'w Gurans and other tribesmen. The town is old and ccmposed of foreign elements and numbers 70,0(&gt;() inhabitmts, whilst in most seasons the p^pu- lath-n is greatly increased by the coming and going of pilgrims.” it will be noticed that, whilst a house is usually taken to represent five inhabitants, iNasr-ed Dm Shah, in speaking of Kermanshah, reckons a bouse at 10 inhabitants. The nobility of Kermanshah consists of Kadjar princes, the descendants of Mob am ;d Ali Mirza Dowlet Shah and of his sons, 0 l lty * and of some of the chiefs of the Kurdish tribes. The nobility have scarcely any influence whatever in Kermanshah, but the chiefs of the tribes maintain their authority over iheir tribesmen in town and in the province. Themollahs who were most powerful under the two late Governors have Moiklis. n°w lost part of their influence. The principal mollahs and mujteheds are— Imam Jumeh (Mirza AssaduHah},' Mohamed Saleh Mujtahed, son of Hajji Aga, Aga Hady Mujtehedand his son Ajxa Kaliim Alujtehed, Aga Abul Gassem Mujtehed, Aga Hady, son of Sheikh Abdur Rahim Mujtehed. Most of the merchants oE Ke* mans hah are really only commission agents Merchants. for their friends of Hamadan and Bagdad. There are about 200 merchants dealing mcstlv in Manchester goods, got direct fr &gt;m Manchester or through Bagdad j in sugar, from Marseilles^ and in opium, guns, goat-skins, carpets and wool, which they exported to Bagdad and England ihere are about 20 Ottoman Jews, who have in their hands the greatest part of the foreign import and export trade. Kashi merchams import from Kashan : tobacco, native silk goods, copper- ware, to a total amount of some 100,000 tomans, which they cover by exports to Kashan of prints and foreign goods received from Bagdad. Yezd merchants import Henna and Yezd silk from Yezd to tne amount of 20,000 tomans, and export an equal ameunt of foreign goods to Yezd. Isfahan! merchants import native prints and cotton goods, such as kalanv* kase, prints, lab Ms, abbas, &amp;c , and gez and givehs from Isfahan ; and ex port to Isfahan , Manchester prints, iron, t rj a, cowhides, wool, gilimsand gez alafi. Their imports come to 100,000 tomans, but are exceeded by their -exports ] the consequence being that bills on Isfahan are always offering in the bazaars. y Hamadan merchants import naphtha, rice, Russian prints, glassware and hardware (comingfrom Resht) ; and export to Hamadan, dates from Man- dali, gall nuts, grease, ghi, raw hides, tea, spices, iron, lead, Manchester goods and window glass. The exports exceed the imports. Iheie aie other Hamaclan merchants who work exclusively as commis* sion agents for releasing goods from the custom-house and forwarding them tc Hamadan;205 Exports to Sultanabad amount to 200,000 tomaus ; and are made up of sugar, tea, spices and piece-goods. The imports aggregate to barely 30 000 tomans, consisting principally of carpets, gums and opium. J There are here a few bankers whose business seems to be mostly the Bank and Bankers. granting of loans and advances against mortgages. The Sherkat Amteeh Am omi, a Persian commercial bank, has had for about a year an agency here ; and, since March 20, 1902, the Imperial Bank ot x ersia have opened a branch in Kermanshah. Ihe sarrafs of Kermanshah are merely moneylenders or brokers, and have no influence over the market ; they pay a tax of 600 krans per annum One finds m Kermanshah, Shiahs, Aliullahis, Babis, a few Sunnis and Religion. Jedid ul lslams, Jews and Christians. The greater part of the town population is of the Shiah p^rsuasmn • it Mussulmans. 7™ ^m,r\y AliuUahi, but Hajji Ali Khan, M T i • ,iovmer Crovcrncr of Kermanshah, who built the Mesjid Jumeh, is said to have forced ihe inhabitants to pray in the mosque and to have Inns rendered, in the course of a few years, the Shiah persuasion paramount m the town of Kermanshah. Most of the tribes are Aliullahis many are c h ahs, whilst a few nearer to the Turkish frontier are Sunnis. ’ As already mentioned, there are here about 20 Jewish merchants, but j eTrs&gt; these are from Bagdad, and are only temporary T ’ residents. There is a fixed population of Persian Jews, numbering about 150 houses, or about 750 souls, who live by small trade and hawking. J 1 A few Chaldean Christians, amounting all told to 30 souls, have settled Christians. ^ ere ’ 0116 of them 18 engaged in trade, the others live . by the manufacture of arak and wine of very in ferior quality. J The real language of the town of Kevmanshali is Kurd!. The town Language. ^ clos , e ^ the Senjabi and Kalhor . , Kurdi. Unfortunately for this language, of which so little is known, the Kurds think it a mark of education to insert in their conversation Persian words here and there. The result of this mixture of languages is that many Kurdish words are getting 1 &gt;st. 'the works of Dr, Oskar Mann (Royal Library, Berlin) will, however soon enable us to have a clear insight into the Kurdish language, and its various ramification' and dialects. About 23,000 passports were delivered this year to pilgrims for Kerbela Pilgrim?. ^ e -i ef ,,rd 1 Kazimein. Only pilgrims travelling on horse, mule or donkey-back, require p rsports ; piRrims on toot, women and_ children require no paespoits. Well-to-do Persians go on horseback or in takhteravan (litter),whilst women usually a-o in kajareh. It is estimated that from 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims nass Kermamhsh yearly en route to Kerbela. Pilgrim caravans have usually a “ch&amp;uish ” or guide, who from time to time sings religious hymns. The caravan is lead by a “ pishahang ” or heavily ornamented mule or horse, carrying a large number of bells. * Large sums of money find their way to Turkey through these pilgrimages. Before leaving Persia pilgrims pay 20 pias. gold per passport for visa* at t.ie Imkish Consulate-General in Kermanshah. About 5,000£. T. are paid m this way per annum. The receipts this year reached 8,200£. T.206 On entering Turkish territory at Khanekin pilgrims are subject to a further quarantine tax of 10 pias. gold. The effect of these pilgrimages is to raise the price of necessaries of life, for a certain time of the year, in the Turkish towns of pilgrimage. It is estimated that on an average a pilgrim spending 60 days in lurkey spends ■about 200 krans during that period. * Apart from this, numerous caravanserais, to which are usually attached large endowments for upkeep, have been and are being built by pious Persian Shiahs, and donations of cash and jewels are of frequent occurrence. For corpses, the charge made by the Turkish authorities in Rermanshah c r g is 35 krans, of which 27i krans or 50 pias. gold are passed to Government account, the rest being kept for expenses. At Khanikin there is a further tax of T. The expenses for taking a body to Kerbela vary from 35 to 60 tomans and upwards. The charges for burial ground are also very high. “ There are but few towns in Persia which show to-day so flourishing a Commerical importance condition, from a trade point of view, as Kermansbah, of Kermanshalu an d this in spite of oppression by the local Governor, and badness and unsafety of the roads radiating from it. Kermanshah is the port of entry for all gords entering Persia from Bogdad, coming from England and India via the Persian Gulf and the Tigris. It is practically the only route available for Western Persia, now that the Luristan road can no longer be reded upon ; supplying such districts as Kurdistan, Hamadan, Irak, and even competing seriously with the trade of the European merchants of Isfahan. At one time a certain portion of the trade filtered down from Tabriz, but now very little comes through that town. Such Russian goods as naphtha, glassware and hardware, as have a s tie in the bazaars, come via Hamadan and Resht.^ (Preece, 1899.) “The commercial importance of Kermanshah has gradually developed since the opening of the Suez (anal, and is due to its being the frontier town on the trade route between Bagdad and Persia. The »reat drawback to this as a trade route is the d&lt;day which frequently takes place between Busreh and Bagdad, towards the end of the summer, owing to the shal lowness of the river.* This*year the river is much lower than usual at this season and vessels drawing more than 3J feet of water cannot pass. Goods are already beginning to accumulate at Busreh, and considerable delays may be anticipated between now and the end of November.” (D. Brown, June, 1901.) There is no doubt that Russian trade is increasing, and when one considers that for many necessaries of life the Russian goods are only prevented from invading the Kermanshah market by the cost of transport from Hamadan to Kermanshah, say 40 krans per kharvar, one will easily see that British interests in this part of Persia require to be strongly upheld if we wish to keep) to ourselves the markets of the north-west and central * Although the delay at Busreh is.very annoying it is not a great drawback, for even if the goods were to come straight through without any delay the only result would be that merchants would delay before ordering goods so as not to overflow the market of Kermanshah Camels from Arabia cannot travel in winter on account of the mud and slippery ground. Sugar is only imported in small quantities in winter, the risk of moisture being very great'West of ‘Persia. It may be said that sugar eomes from^ Marseilles, aind consequently our interest tvould not be shaken were Russian sugar ever to reach Kirmanshah, bdt it must be borne in mind that any decrease in the trade entering Persia vid Bagdad means a proportionate loss to ottr ship ping interests. It is net my intention to iftake comparisons between the figures for imports and exports of this province for various years. I will simply attach Mr. Preece J s tables for the year 1897, and the average of the three preceding years (1894*, 1895, 1.896), which he includes in his Report No. 2260 as well as the returns of imports and exports for the years ending March 20, 1901, and March 20, 1902, which were kindly put at my disposal bv Baron Wedel, the Director-General of the Customs of the province of Kerman shah. The total imports to Kermanshah vid Bagdad for the year March 21, 1901, to March 20, 1902, amount to 46,749,979 mports. krans, and taking the £1 at 54 krans, or its value on March 20, 1902, we get to a total of £865,740. The principal items forming this total are as follows :— From—• Articles. Value. Currency. Sterling’'. United Kirgdom ...

Sugar from Marseilles cannot stand the cost of transport from Kerman- sbab to Hamadan to compete with Kussian sugar in the Hamadan market, but it goes to Sultanabad. The Austrian goods are chie^y for local use. Raw hides from Bagdad are tanned in Hamadan and sold in Persia. Lamb-skins from Bagdad are dressed in Hamadan and then go to Russia vid Resht or Tabriz. Dates from Kermanshah (mostly from Mandali) spread over the whole of the north of Persia up to Isfahan. It will be seen from the tables attached that British trade is represented In the imports by a total of £684,522, Indian trade by £46,013, and French trade by £679,571. The export vid Kermanshah amounted for the year to 9,867,477 brans (£182,731), of which about £120,000 goes to the xpor s. United Kingdom and India, and £38,575 to France. The principal items are opium, 133,308^ lbs., costing 3,511,687 krans (£65,031) ; gums, 2,121,948 krans (£39,295); wool, 265,170 krans (£4,910), which go to the United Kingdom as well as part of the total amount of 816,822 krans (£15,682) for carpets, the balance of this last item going to America. Part of these carpets come from Sultanabad, having been manufactured under the supervision of the Persian Carpet Manufacturing Company, Limited, whilst the rest are old carpets or carpets from Sarukh. Many of the carpets seat to Bagdad come also from Luristan, Malayer, end their oufc’ying districts. The ordinary carpets find a ready sale in Egypt, Syria, Bagdad and Bombay. France receives silk products to the extent of 2,081,854 krans (£38,553). Some other items of export are dried fruits for the Bagdad market, giving a total of 248,238 krans (£4,597), and goat-skins, dressed or raw, 321,271 krans (£6,005). The dried fruits uome from Hamadan, Malayer and Irak, but no great care is taken in the jiaeking. Native cotton and woollen goods snob as kalamkars, abbas, &amp;c., Yezd silk, Kashan silk, are also exported to Bagdad for sale there. A considerable amount of aniline dyes, the use of which was fast ruining Aniline dyes. t ^ le car P e ^ trade, was till quite lately imported from Bagdad, but the Customs authorities here have taken such severe steps that the smuggling of these dyes has proved a very costly business to the people, chiefly Persian Jews, given to this trade. It is evident that if the Bagdad railway be constructed, and if it be extended to the Persian Gulf, it will do much to increase the importance of the Kermanshah route and of the town as a port of entry for Persia. When it is considered that from Busreh to Bagdad by the Shat el Arab and the Tigris the distance is 510 miles, whilst as the crow flies the209 &gt;&gt; i, d o e i b 8 e 8 ) f r 7 1 r&gt; &gt; 1 » L. J l P l l L r i / I » * distance is only 800 miles, and that now it costs as much to send goods from Busreh to Bagdad as to g^t them from London to Busreh, one will easily imagine the enormous impetus which will be given to the Kermanshah trade by the cheapening of the cost of transport, a natural result of the railway to Khanekin and the Gulf. In 1900 “ homeward freights to London varied from £1 5$. to £1 \Zs. 6i. per ton, these rates being from Busreh to London, including the tran shipping charges at Busreh, but not the river freight from Bugded to Busreh, which varies from 10$. Sd. to £1 19$. Id. per ton. Outward ocean freights from London and Manchester to Bagdad were steadily maintained at from £8 10$. to £4 per ton, including freight from Busreh to Bagdad/ 5 (Consular Report for 1900, No. 2707 Annual Series.) The imports from Russia, rid Resht and Kazvin or Teheran, amount to about 750,000 krans per annum. The principal items are prints, cloth, velvet, naphtha, hardware, tea and cigarettes.

' By its position, Kerman shah is a town of considerable importance both strategically and commercially. It is nearly equi-distant from Tabriz, Enzeli, Teheran, Isfahan and Bagdad, to which places it has direct routes. The amount for which the customs of Kermanshah were farmed w;is Custom house rcceipta, gradually increased as yoars went on. In 1881 the Kermanshiih, customs of this province were farmed out for 200,0(H) krans. For the year ending March 20, 1897, the Vekil ed Dowleh paid 480,000 krans, whilst the following year, ending Match 20, 1898, Karguzar Abdul Rhaleh Khan took them over at 60;),000 krans. The last amount given was 670,000 krans, at which price Nusret ed Divan farmed the customs for the year ending March 20, 1899. On March 21, 1899, the customs were taken over by the Belgians, and tjie receipts for the first year amounted to 900,000 krans, including rahdari. The customs duty was then 2 per cent, for natives and 5 and 6 per cent, fcj: foreigners; lamb-skins paid 5 per cent. The exports to Bagdad for that year stood at 7,385,540 krans, whilst the imports were 28,416,722 krans. The exports from Kermanshah to the interior of Persia stood at 1,036,077 kracs, and the imports from the interior to Kermanshah at 3,173,765 kranji. The result for the year ending March 20, 1901, was 1,098,383 krans (inland customs duty having been abolished). Finally, the year ending March 20, 1902, gave 3,041,851 krans ; the uniform duty of 5 per cent* being charged for natives as well as foreigners, except Turkish subjects, who paid 6 per cent, for imports and 12 per cent, for exports# The last212 two years include Rahdari or a charge of 1*10 brans (22shahis) for every 40 manns. Under the energetic direction of Belgian officials the working of tlie Customs lias greatly improved, the frontier is effectively patrolled by armed sowars ; and the revenue derived from the Customs of the province of Kermanshah will uo doubt he greatly increased. The control of the frontier has been extended and there are now posts at the following places :—Province of Kermanshah: Kermanshah, central office; Kasr-i-Shirin, collecting and control station; Dub rulleh near Mendali collecting station; Sarah Gilan, control station ; Ushkuri, 3 farsakhs from Kasr-i-Shirin and £ farsakh from the £ronti«r, established in order to pre vent the use by caravans of the direct road leading to Zohab.

There is another tax (hawai) on goods entering and leaving the country. jj awa * &gt; I 11 former years the custom-house compound belonged to the Government, and a charge was made for all goods deposited in it, the Government being responsible for any goods stolen. Ibis compound has long been sold to private individuals, and the custom-house does not hold itself responsible for the goods deposited in its present compound. Yet the charge is still made by the Governor, and special collectors are appointed to watch the caravans and collect the tax, which is 1 kran per every 12 loads. The currency of Kermanshah is of new coin, specially the Do-Hezari; Currency* 1-kran pieces, when they have no holes, command up to 3 per cent, premium, old coin is at a discount213 1 to 1£ pel’ cent. Copper coin is still in circulation at the rate of 61 puls per kran. It is said that there is here up to 10,000 tomans of copper coin, gtill in circulation'. Nickel coin, of which 3,000 tomans we»e put in circulation in Kermanshah two years ago is readily accepted, and in the Villages preferred to copper. Bef&gt; re the establishment of the Government Mint in Teheran, Kerman shah had a Mint of its own. The coin turned out here was fairly good. From assays made by Herr Pec' an we see that Kermanshah k ans of 1866 A. D., 128$ A.H., gave the following results :—weight, 497 grains, fineness 880, value in francs O’yTiO. The Kermanshah kraus, being better than the average krans from other Persian Mints, have nearly all been ie-minted. Most of the coin in this part of Persia is spoiled by the Kurds boring holes through it to make ornaments for their wives and daughters. There is a great movement of specie in Kermanshah, and large amounts of specie are weekly sent to Teheran. Notwithstanding these remittances coin accumulates here, being brought by the pilgrims or passed Irom hand to hand, from village, to village until it is finally brought to town for the purchase of clothing, &amp;c.

The prospects of trade for next year are, however, not very promising. For some time panic reigned in the market through the abnormal number of bankruptcies which took place during the months of August and September. The market, however, soon recovered and business took its usual course again. On March 25, 1903, the rate for three montbs &gt; date paper on London was 57£ krans per 1£. It fell gradually to 55 krans, middle of July ; rose again to 56£ brans ,* to fall to krans end of September. Since dien it has risen little by little up till the time of writing, the last quotation being 56^ krans per 1£. The average rate for the year was 56 krans per 1£. Paper on Baghdad 21 da} s at sight fetched on average 51 krans per 1£ T. About 4,000£ drafts on London are sold weekly in Kermanshah and remitted to Baghdad and Manchester ; and about L000£ T. bills on Baghdad are remitted weekly to Baghdad against goods ordered. The total imports to Kermanshah (province of Kermanshah) via Baghdad for the year amount to 49,567,815 krans (8S5,.1B9£ at 56 krans per 1£). Although the Kerrranshah customs have been under European supervision from 1899, it is only for the last six months that the Director has been a Belgian customs official. The returns of imports and exports for the past four years are accurate as far as quantity and value go, but no great care has been taken to ascer tain what amount was imported from or exported to various countries. f ihe result is that whilst the trade of some countries is greatly exaggerated that of others is minimised. For instance, sugar is given as coming from France, whilst in reality part of it comes from Belgium. Candles, which are given as coming from France, are received from the Netherlands, Belgium and France. During the last six months greater care has been taken, and I give the following figures of trade of various countries, basing myself on the averages of the last six months and on what 1 have seen in the bazaars.

D.)» According to the same author Khosrow Nur Shirva’i is supposed to have built here a palace where he received, in the audience hall, the homages of the Emperor of Rome, the Ruler of China and of the Khan of the Tartars. There are no ruins to he seen, and in all probability the town wns formerly quite near Tak-i-Bostan where large mud embankments are still to be seen. A few mounds or tumuli are also to be found here, and the Persians point to one as the site of Khosrow Parviz’ palace. No excavations have ever been made, and, for the present, one can only make conjectures as to what may lav hiddeu under these tumuli or buried within the enclosure of the mud embankment at Tak-i-Bostan. Mr. De Morgan says : {i Kirmanchahan est designee par les auteurs arabes sous le nom de Qarmisin ou Kirmisin. Isidore de Charaz Panomme Kambadini, ce dernier nom ne s’applique pas au site actuel de la vilh qui iPest pas tres ancienne, mais bien aux ruines qu’oo rencontre a quelques kilometres plus au nord.” The village of Kermanshah Kohneh is supposed to have been the emplacement of the Government buildings and arsenal before and during the Turkish occupation. Amongst European authors, for centuries, no mention of the place is made, dhe Jesuit, Raphael Dumas of Isfahan, just mentions it as Kermanshah “ la capitale des Gourdes.” Pietro della Valle who in 1616-17 passed the plain of Kermanshah on his way from Mahidasbt to the Pol-i-Sbah or Pol-i-Karasu, never mentions Kermanshah, although lie must have passed within a few miles of the town. The following are a few notes I have been able to gather on the history of Kermanshah during the last two centuries :— In the time of Mahmud Khan Afghan, Kermanshah was subdued by Ahmed, the Pasha of Baghdad, but later on Ashraff Khan compelled him to leave Kermanshah and to fall back upon Baghdad. Daring the wars between Nadir Shah and the Turks (130 135), Kerman shah was taken and retaken many times by the Turks, but remained finally in the hands of the Persians. From the Tarikh-i-Mujineli-bard-Nad ri, which has been published by Dr. Mann, we learn that Mirza Mohammed Taki was Governor of Kermanshah under Nadir Shah, who in 1154 A. H. bestowed upon him the title of Mustowfi-ul-Mamalek. On, the death of Nadir Shah, Mirza Mohammed Taki took the part of Ali Shah against B rahim Shah. This latter besieged Kermanshah, which was surrendered by Mirza Mohammed Taki, together with all the military implements and stores collected in the town by Nadir Shah. Ibrahim Shah having been defeated and killed by Shah-Rukh, M irza Mohammed Taki declared himself independant chief of Kermanshah. The town was many a time pillaged by the Zends under the oirection of Kerim Khan, then a highwayman whose stronghold was afc Pariveh near Hersin, Kerim Khan, having taken in hand the reins of the Government, invested Kermanshah in 1164 A. H., but had to retire on hearing of the defeat of Ali Merlan Khan, Ali Merlan Khan was killed near Nehavend and the siege of KermanshaH was renewed and vigorously220 pushed on. After a stubborn resistance of two years the town had to surrender on account of the ravages caused by famine. Mirza Mohammed Taki and his nephew Mirza-ibn-Mohammed Amin were taken prisoners, but escaped and retook possession of Kermanshah, which they held in the name of Azad Khan Afghan who had inflated a severe defeat on the armies of Kerim Khan. Shortly afterwards Mirza Mohammed Taki was murdered by the Zends and Mirza ibn-Mohammed Amin escaped to India where in the years 119o-U96 A. H. he wrote this bistor}'. “In the early part of the century, Fath AH Shah conferred the Governorship of the province and city upon his eldest son Mohammed Ali Mirza,, whose jealousy of Abbas Mirza, the heir-apparent, plays so large a part in the history of the contemporary writers. —(Curzon.) Mohammed Ali Mirza Dowlet Shah, was succeeded by his eldest son Mohammed Hussein Mirza, Heshmet-ed-Dowleh, who was Governor for ten years. A few years later Imam Guli Mirza Emad-ed-Dowleh, brother of Heshmet- ed-Dowleh was appointed Governor, in which position he remained for 21 years When the Shah passed by here on his way to Kerbela in 1871, a hu S e‘petition, complaining of the oppression of the Governor was presented to His Imperial Majesty the Shah but was not answered. In l.'85 this province formed part of the immense Government ot Zil-es-Sultan, Kermanshah was visited many times during the last century by Europeans, and during the beginning of that century by many of His Majesty’s envoys and officers. Macdonald Kinneir speaks of Kermanshah as a flourishing town o£ about 12.000 houses, containing 14 hammams, or public baths, 4 mosques and yielding a revenue of 15,000 tomans. It has suffered severely from plague, cholera and famine.

KURDS— The following notes from Curzon s Persia and the Persians apply to the Kurds of Kerrnanshah: “By far the greater part of the Persian Kurds are sedentary and pastoral. A great many of them farm and till the ground on the plains and hill slopes; an even larger number keep herds of sheep, goats and cattle, from which they make excellent cheese and butter; and the extent of their nomadic habits is, in most casos, that in the summer months they move into camps on the higher acclivities, above the settled villages which they inhabit in the winter. Nomad Kurds are to be found paituularly in Turkish terri tory, and on the border; and perhaps the wealthiest and mist independent of the tribes belong to this class, the cultivators of the soil and shepherds being, as a rule, deplorably ignorant and poor, As regards their character, every variety may be found in their midst, from the typical robber chieftain to the harmless peasant, and from the dashing warrior to the miserable thrall. Those who know them best deny that they are naturally either cruel or fanatical, and credit them with a rude hospitality and high courage. When excited, however, they are as ugly customers as can be encountered. Their position amid hostile and craven communities, whose religion they abhor, tempts them to anarchy and turbulence. Ruled by a strong but just hand, there is no . reason why they should not become an orderly community, very useful for purposes of warfare.” They are an extraordinarily ignorant and extraordinarily stupid people with neither education, schools, nor books, and it has been said of the whole race that not one in 10,000 can read. They have the black hair and eyes, the dark complexion and the sullen swagger (so characteristic too of the Afghans) that are usually associated with picturesque ruffianism; and the sympathies and fears of travellers have variously represented their features as strikingly handsome, or repulsively ugly. There can be no doubt that by far the most lawless and rascally of the Kurds are the frontier tribes, who migrate forwards and backwards across the border line, according to the season of the year or the hope of plunder, .seeking refuge from an atrocity in the one country by retreat to the other. Twenty-five years ago Mr. J. Gf. 'l aylor, British Consul at Diarbekr, penned the following paragraph which is as true now as when composed :— “This mixed nationality of one family and the still unsettled state of the frontier cause interminable disputes between the Governments of Persia and Turkey. The Kurds being equally at home in one country as in the other cross the border whenever they feel inclined or it suits their purpose, either247 For business or to evade proper punishment due to crimes committed in one or the other country. All attempts to levy taxes, enforce conscription, and arrest offenders are thwarted by a hasty migration to Persia or Turkey as the case may be. The military cordon stationed along the line, that ought, if efficiently organised, to assist Government in enforcing order and obe dience, is totally useless for either, while the jealousies and quarrels invari ably existing between the civil and military authorities thwart any well devised action of the former. The majority of the sedentary Kurds of Ardalan and Kermanshah who have long been settled in villages, have completely abandoned both the national instincts and the national dress (except the women) and are not at first sight to be mistaken from Persians.” KURETU—Zohab. Aziz Khan Bajilan is posted at this village with 100 horsemen as a protection against the inroads of the Jail's. Aziz Khan is said to derive 700 Tomans per annum from his villages.

It is a small but flourishing town 87 miles east of Kermanshah on the road from Kermanshah to Hamadan, between Bisutun ami Kangavar. It is situated at the foot of a range of precipitous rooky hills, where are some ancient caves. The caravanserai built by the Hajji of Nirwan is fast going to ruins. When Taylor and Ferrier visited bahna it was a flourishing place of 500 houses. Rozario after toe great famine, found only 100 families remaining. In Sahna are to be found a few Atishbeghi Seyyeds of the Aliullahi sect. The town, which is surrounded by gardens, is said to contain at the present moment 200 houses. A brawling torrent having its rise in a gorge about 1 farsakh above the town runs through the gardens. Grain and opium are the chief products. The revenue of Salma was given me as Ts. 1,700 cash and Khaiwars 1,000 gram. Opium is cultivated round the village of Sahna and the crop is estimat ed at about 100 to 150 maunds of opium. Cotton has been grown again since^ the last two years and fetches 6 krans per mann. It is sold to Kurdistan and Kermanshah merchants. Poles from the extensive gardens of Sahna ara sold in Kermanshah and used as rafters. The principal fruits produced are : grapes, quince, plums (alucheh) and (gaujeh), cherries (alubalu), apricots (zardalu) and garden crops. Nobody apart from the tenants of the caravanserai and coffee-house is allowed to sell provisions to pilgrims. The coffee-house alone is let at Tomans 1,100 per annum. One can easily imagine the profit derived from this district by the people who hold it in Tuyool. Wine and arak are manufactured in the village, and a few gilims and rough carpets are woven by the women. There are in the gorge behind the town two rock tombs, access to one of which can only be had by means of ropes. There are neither sculptures nor inscriptions. The Persians call the place the tomb of Kai-Kouss. SAHNA— Bulux or District of Sahna— This district can be divided into two distinct parte!L 7* 298 1 . Sahna and its immediate dependencies, which were formerly Khalesseh ©r Crown property, but have been given in Tuyool to Yezir-ed-Daftar of Teheran and his descendants* The chief place is Sahna, long. 47° 33' 34 v East. Grain and opium are the chief products. 2 . The village and hamlets belong to Khodabendelu Khans. These villages are said to number 23. The Khodabendelu are responsible for the revenue direct to the Accountants Department of Kermanshah. This district is watered partly by the Gamasiab and partly by springs and mountain torrents, the most important being the Ab-i-Sabna which rises in a gorge about 1 farsakh in length just above the village of Sahna^ and which waters the gardens of Sahna before being used up in irrigating ths fields.

Cultivation : wheat, daimi.” (Post Master, Sar-i^pol.) Sau-i-Pol-i-Zohab or Sar-i-Pol — Ancient Khalman. Sir H. Rawlinson says: The real site of Ilolva • ^ . 'in, one of the primeval cities of the world, was at Sar-i-pol-i-Zohab, ei&gt;ht miles south'of the present town, this is the Caiah of Asshur and the Halah of the Israeli, tish captivity (for description and account of Israelitish captivity see Gemsis X, % to 12 2nd Kings XVII, 6 to 11. 1st Chronicles X, 26. fB V 701-715) ) It gave to the sUrrouiiding districts the name of Chaloni'tis’ The etymological identity is I believe the last claim which Holwan possess es to be considered the representative of Calah of Asshur but for its veiification as the scene of the captivity (Samaritan), there are manv other curious and powerful reasons. We find in Strabo that this region alonir the skirts of the Zagros was sometimes adjudged to Media, and sometimes to Assyria and we are thus able to explain the dominion of Shalmaneser the. Assyrian King over the cities of the Medes. Some of the Christian Arabs in their histones directly translate the Halah of the captivity by Holvan Jewish traditions abound in this part of the country, and David is still regarded by the tnbes as their great tutelar prophet. . . . There can ha no question I must observe, about Sar-i-pol-i-Zohab being the real site of Holvan. The oriental itineraries and geographical notices are quite decisive upoa this pouit ; the rums themselves bear certain evidence/ and299 i the spot is still known by some of the Kurds by the very title of Shahr-i* Holwan (the city of Holwan). Holwan continued a large and populous town long after the Arab invasion of Persia. It was often partially des troyed in the conflicts of the Abasside Kaliphate^ but it again rose from its ruins, and it was not until the visiting of the desolating hordes of Hulakn in their descent on Baghdad in 1258 A.D., that it received its final blow and sank before the exterminating hand of war never again to be inhabited.” The river is supposed to be the ancient Gozan. Mr 0 E. L, Mitl'ord, E.R.G.S. (Erom England to Ceylon forty years ago, 1881) writes : “The ruins are called by the (Ilyats) Kaleh Afrasiab ; according to D’Herbelot, there were two of this name; the first of these was Afrasiab, a Turkish leader and King of Touran and Transoxiana, who conquered Persia in the time of the ninth Sovereign of Assyria of the Pishdadian dynasty. Erom this King the Seljukians and the present Turkish Sultans pretend to derive their descent; another of the name was conquered and slain by Rustam, son of Zabzer, general of Kai Khosroe, third of the Kaianian dynasty. ” The following is a precis from Mr. De Morgan^ book, 1892. During the Elamite epoch, Khalman (Khilmi, Khamanu or Hamanu) was the most important place in the country; it gave its name to the whole district situated to the South and West of Mount Dalahu. There are very few elamitic ruins remaining and it is scarcely, if at the first aspect of the country, one recognizes in Sar-i-pol-i-Zohab the site of the important strong-hold which was besieged by Teglatphalasar, Sargon, Sennacherib, Assurbanipal and many other Kings of Niniva. Behind the modern caravanserai at the foot of the mountain Mr. De Morgan found some queerly cut stones which he believes to be altars or tables ior offerings of the Elamite period* Apart from its strategical situation the town and district of Khalman offered for Chaldea a special interest. At the foot of its mountains (Kuh-i- Bozinan) not far from the Kuretu river are rich sheets of naphtha, whence the people of Mesopotamia got supplies. These springs are scarcely worked nowadays but the numerous ancient cemeteries adjoining these localities show without doubt that in former times they were the object of greater care. In the valley on the left bank of the Hoi van near the village of Mollah Golam are to be seen the ruins of a fortress which Mr. De Morgan believes to be Sassanian. Further on are the ruins of a palace also of the • Sassanian period. These ruins are not isolated, near the village of Sheikh Aman the villagers discovered the lower parts of a hall which was ornamented with square pillars. ^ Of the tumuli which are numerous in the Holvan valley many are of the Elamite period but most of them are of the Sassanian epoch. Bas-reliefs and inscriptions— The great panel of Hezar Jeri is situated on a vertical rock at a height of about 30 metres above the ground. The rock is formed of a very hard yellowish marble. Beneath the great panel of Hezar-Jeri is another panel, much more recent and greatly damaged by exposure. It represents a figure on horseback300 (Mr. E. L. Mitford, F.R.G.S., says two figures on horseback) ; on the right and left of the horseman's head were inscriptions now greatly effaced in which Mr. Ee Morgan thinks he recognized letters of the Aramaean alpha bet. On the same rock in the cut through which passes the Hoi wan river was another small tablet now practically completely effaced. On the opposite side of the river, on the rocks facing the Hezar-Jeri mass, one sees the effigy of a personage, but the ravages of time have completely obliterated all trace of the inscription of this panel which by its whole appearance seems to be very ancient. In the large panel of Hezar-Jeri the figures are nearly life size, the outline of the panel is very irregular and the relief is of a few centimetres only. The bas-relief is composed of two parts divided by a horizontal line. In the upper panel the King (Anu-Banini) is represented with his foot on a prisoner, and facing him is the goddess Nini bringing 2 prisoners. The lower panel represents five captives, their hands tied behind their backs and headed by a crowned king, marching from left to right. The right corner of the panel is occupied by a long inscription, a paleographic study of which shews it to be of about the same period as that of the restoration of the panel of Sheikham The inscription was extensive but only half now remains. This is the translation that Rev. Father Y. Schei! gives of it: “Anu- banini, powerful king, King of Lulubi, has erected his image and that of the goddess Istar, on Mount Batir. Whoever should destroy these images and this tablet may Anum and Anatum, Bel and Belit, Ramman Istar, Sin and Samas curse him with fateful curses, may they destroy his progeny.'' This is the road by which Cyrus, Darius Hystaspes and Alexander led their armies to conquer Babylonia and Assyria and was the boundary between Media and Assyria. For other panel and rock tomb see Bukkan-i-Daud. SARIVEH.—Kangavar. A village of the district of Kangavar. SARKALLEH.—Zohab. The plain of Sarkalleh north of the plain of Zohab is the Garmsirs of the 2 branches of Jaffs who are under the Gurans. Rich speaks of a village 9 miles east of Zohab in Kermanshah on the road to Banikalan and Solei- manieh, but this village no more exists. There is a ruined fort in the plain, SAR-KUH. A mountain South of Zardalan .—(#0 Morgan.) SAR-KUH-KAMGA.—Kalhor. Also called Caravanserai Kamga. Elevation 1,760 metres. (De Morgan.) On leaving the Goawur plain, on the road from Harunabadto Gilan, aud at the foot of the Kuh-i-Kechel one finds an old ruined Shah Abbassi cara vanserai called Sai’-Kuh-Kamgah. From the caravanserai to Kalkosh the road runs along the right bank of the stream except at ^ farsakh from Kal kosh where through a bend in the river, the river has to be forded twice.801 S ARM A.T—II ersin. A village of the Herein district. In Sarmaj one farsakh from Bisutun there are the foundations of what is probably an old Sassanian palace. In some of the walls of the village are to be seen huge stones with scrolls and foliage very much resem- bli ng- the stvle of foliage in the sculptures at Tak-i-Bostan. This is probably identical with the Takht-i-Shirin mentioned by He Morgan. SARNASHUR—Kalb or. Pasture land and camping ground in the Kalhor district. Malyat Krs. 1H9-928 dinars cash and Kh. 6-t)6-20.

A village of the Zir-Darband district belonging to Fath-ul-Mamalek and Kerim Khan. S ATAR—Kuliai. A village of the Kuliai district, belonging to Haider Ali Khan. See Kuliai.. SAUMAR—Eivan. The plain of Saumar extends from DubruDeh in Persian territory to the Kumesang hills, which are said to be the frontier between Persia and Turkey. The plain has the shape of an oval. The road from Dubrulleh to Mend all passes through the plain. The pass over the Kumesaog hills is called Tang-i-Kumesang. The Turkish village i farsakh further on the left is also called Kumesang. From Dubrulleh to Kumesang the distance is 2 farsakhs. From Kumesang to Mendali the distance is f farsakh. The hills bordering Saumar are only 50 metres high. The Turks still lay claim to this small district, and in 1903 when Persia wanted to establish a Custom Control Office, the Yali sent word that recourse would be had to force, if necessary, in order to prevent any building being* erected on this disputed bit of land. The Turks lay claim to the plain of Saumar and one can easily un derstand why. The river of Gangir which descends from Eivau has just enough water for the date.tree fields of Mendali. Were the plain of Saumar brought under cultivation no water would remain for Mendali and this would soon cause the ruin of that town. Four years ago when nomads sowed some fields m the Saumar plain the lurks sent a small military expedition to destroy the crops. ^ On hearing of this Daoud Khan Kalhor gathered his horsemen and besieged Mendali. He was recalled by the Persian Gov ernment but only left after having caused serious damage to the town and villages of Mendali. Since that date Saumar has been uncultivated.802 In summer when the nomads ascend to cooler localities the plain of Saumar is overrun by neighbouring robbers, Surds or Arabs. Muleteers have to wait at Mendali till they are sufficiently numerous to defend them selves. Since about a year they are accompanied across the plain of Saumar up to Dubrulleh by Zaptiehs from Mendali, the Yali of Baghdad thus main taining the claim of his Government on this territory.” (Cesari. February 1904). In the spring of 1S04 the Turks invaded once more the plain of Saumar. The Persian Government sent a protest to the various Lega i ns in Teheran and then instructed the Customs' Authorities in Kermanshah to investigate the means of safeguarding the rights of Persia to Saumar. The following report was sent to Teheranr The river of Eivan is formed by the junction of two streams, the Ab- i-Cxangir and the Ab-i-Khoram, and enters the plain of Saumar at a. spot called Do-Bararan. Its total length from Gangir which is at one farsakh. from Sar Tang Eivan, to the beginning of the Saumar territory, is 121 farsakhs The river then crosses the plain of Saumar which is 2 farsakhs in length and enters the territory of Mendali at a spot known as Kume- eamr. From here to Mendali the distance is i farsakh. r~y The whole length of the river from its source to the end of the territory of Saumar is 16 farsakhs ; from the source of the river to Sar-tang, 5 farsakhs; from Savtang to Do-Bararan at the beginning of the plain of Saumar farsakhs, and from Do-Bararan to the hill of Saumar known as Kalleh Ahmed Khao, farsakhs, and from here to Mendali 1 farsakh. The river passes all the w T ay either through cliffs of solid rock or through narrow valleys and its waters can only be diverted at a spot called S add eh, near Do-Bararan. There is here a dry canal which follows a northerly direction for $ farsakh and then changing its direction joins another torrent- bed which, I am told, runs down to Mendali. The bed of the river is 2-| arshins below the bed of the canal and to divert the water, ten arshins of solid rock has to be removed by gun-powder and other implements. It is my opinion that in former days the two canals were on the same level and that the Ab-bGangir divided here into two branches, the one running down to Mendali, the other to Khanikin. In order to obtain more water for Mendali or perhaps by the natural action of the water the bed of the river going to Mendali has become deeper. There are two ways or diverting the river, either by a dam, or by lowering the level of the canal bed, but a combination of the two would probably best suit the purpose. The work cannot be undertaken by the nomads, aad will cost from 5 to 7 thousand tomans. I hear that there was formerly a dam at this spot but was unable to find any trace of it. I beliere there never existed a dam here, but that the inhabitants having had a quarrel with the Menddiji, decided upon con structing a dam, a project which fell to the ground as soon as differences were made up between the two parties. The Ab-i-Gangir can only he diverted at this spot unless one decides upon tunnelling through some of the mountains at an enormous cost.303 The hill of Saumar can easily be defended, and with sangars here, i.e., \ farsakh from the frontier, and at the spot where the mountains nearly meet, one ought to be able to protect the works.

Its name is derived from tw r o Sunni saints whose tombs are here (these surmounted with their white cupolas and embosomed in orchards form a very picturesque object). Sheikh Khan numbers all told 100 houses. Twenty minutes further up the gorge behind the village, in a hill called Darband, is an elamitic panel representing a man with bow and arrow and two supplicant figures at his feet. There is also a cuneiform inscription. The translation of the inscription is given by R. P. V. Seheil as “ Tar ni son of has erected this image. When he restored it. W r hoever destroys the image, may his descendants and name be annihilated by Samas and Ramman/' This is supposed to be the most ancient inscription in the province of Kermanshah. The inscription and panel are in a narrow ravine towards the mountain, i.e,, north-east, and are found with difficulty amongst the rocks. R. P. V. Scheil believes the inscription to be contemporary with Sargon of Agada and of Gudea, whilst the sculpture is believed to be cf a far remoter period— probably the most ancient specimen of sculpture in Asia.

Of 200 Sinjabi sowars I had occasion to see on the occasion of the arrival of a diamond ring sent by special messenger by H. I, M. the Shah to the Governor of Kermanshah in February 1903, I noticed that 75 percent, had imitation Martini rifles and 25 per cent, fche rifle in use in the Cossack brigade at Teheran or an imitation of the said rifle. To my knowledge the Sinjabis mobilized in September 1903, 300 horse men for Goyernmtnt service. I believe in case of need for their own purposes they could muster 500 to 700 horsemen. Regarding this tribe Mr. T. C. Plowden says (1881): “ The country of the Sinjabis extends from the Khan of Mahidasht to Chelleh and Zalouab which lies 6 farsakhs to the west of the town of Kermanshah. This tribe hus two principal divisions: ( 1 ) Chalabi, of which Farajullah Khan is chief; ( 2 ) Dilyari (?.), under Ilahi Khan. The whole tribe numbers about 1,000 families, and furnishes a contingent of 150 horsemen on the usual terms. The Sin jabis, like the Kalhors, are famous breeders of mules, but the three years’ famine has told heavily on their resources, and they are not in a prosperous condition.^ “ They number FOOO tents and can raise 750 hoisemen of which 200 are entered as in Government service. Their present Chief Shir Khan, Sam- sam-ul-Mamalek is also governor of Kasr-i-Shirin. His son Gassem Khah, is Governor of Kalleh Sabzi. In summer the tribe inhabits the plain of Mahidasht. In winter they camp between Kasr-i-Shirin and the frontier on either side of the Holvan river, but a considerable part of the tribe spends313 the winter in Turkish territory between Khanikin and Shahreban. A brother and two uncles of Samsam-ul-Mamalek and some 30 binjabi horsemen were killed 3 years ago by Daoud Khan Kalhor at Harunabad and since then the Sinjabis and Kalhors have been at war. The Governors of Ker- manshah take care to maintain this feud which enables them to rule the frontier. Shir Khan who is very intelligent has managed to remain om the best of terms with the Governor of Kermanshah and has thus obtained an influen- ** tial and predominating position at the frontier which he could otherwise retain but with difficulty, as apart from his strained relations with the Kalhors, he is not very well with the Bajlans or even with the Gurans.” {Cesari, 1904.)315 SINJAR— A place between Ziarat-i-Hassan and Juanrud.

Sculptures op Tak-i-Bostan— Tak-i-Bostan as the place is now usually named is known for its Sassanian sculptures and inscriptions which consist of 2 arches or recesses, and a panel on the face of the cliff. The first arch to the left, the largest and containing the two famous panels representing the boar hunt and the stag hunt, measures 30 feet in height, ‘ 2 d feet in width, and 22 feet in depth. Outside on the face of the rock are two panels with foliage executed in a most artistic and classical manner. Over the arch is a crescent and in the spandrels on either side two large winged female figures holding in one hand a circlet or crown and in the other a drinking cup. Part of the angel on the left has fallen with the rock but the face is still intact, the angel to the right is still very well preserved as well as a fine classic cornice round the arch. On either side of the grotto were walls ending in high steps, the one to the right cut in the rock, the one to the left built with huge stones. This latter one has disappeared and only the indentures into which some of the stones fitted are now to be seen. Over the arch above the crescent the rock has been cut so as to represent battlements, and some authors say it is probable that over these were statues and inscriptions, but there is absolutely nothing to justify such an opinion. On the outer wall to the right there is a Persian inscription commemorat ing the visit of Nasr-ed-Din Shah. The inner wall of this recess is divided into two compartments, the upper one represents Khosroe II Parviz (590-6*28 A., D.) with two supporters, the one on the left probably a female figure. These are often said to represent the Emperor Mauritius giving Sira or Shirin to Khosroe, but they are generally considered to be emblematic figures. The lower compartment is occupied by the colossal figure of Khosroe in military array on horse back. The panel on the left in this recess represents a boar hunt whilst the one on the right represents the chase of the deer, both very fine specimens of Workmanship which have been judged the best to be found in Persia, Un fortunately the figures iu the chase of the deer have not all been finished, and in neither of the two panels have all the figures been polished ; the few that have been polished give us a faint idea of the skill of the sculptors, who have been pronounetd by many to hail from Greece. Squeezes of these two panels are to be found in the Musee du Louvres. The second arch is 17 feet high, 19 feet wide and 11^ feet deep. On the inner wall at a certain height from the ground are two figures, which from the inscriptions in Pahlevi, we learn, represent Shapur II Zulektaf (310-379 A. D.) son of Hormazdes II, and his son Shapur III (385-390 A. D.) The copy and translation of the inscriptions are attached. Finally there is a roughly-sculptured panel on the ffice of the cliff which is usually accepted as representing Shapur 1 (241-273-A. D.) being invested by his father Ardesbir I (211-241 A. X&gt;. Founder of the Sassanian dynasty826 with half the kingdom. To the left is the God Oramzd. Under Ardeshir and Shapur is a prostrate figure wearing a Roman helmet. Some say this figure is meant for Artabanus, the last Parthian king, whilst others prefer to see in it the Emperor Valerian. The figures in the first vault and those in the second one and on the face of the cliff have been wantonly damaged. The hind leg of Khosroe’s horse has been broken off, and the head of the horse mutilated and nearly all the faces have been defaced. The Persians say that this happened during the Arab occupation. The panels represent^ ing the hunts have also been damaged by Persians, trying to add some figures, and by a few Europeans who have thought naught of cutting their names right in the centre of these works of art. When Nasr-ed*Din Shah visited the place he exclaimed : “ Sightseers have not left a single blank space without their inscriptions” . The smooth surface in the lower panel of the first arch, near Khosroe’s equestrian statue, has been utilized by former travellers to commemorate their journey through this part of Persia. Amongst other names can i e deciphered those of Brigadier-General J. Malcolm and of Sir II. Rawlinson. There are no inscriptions previous to last century. Over the boar hunt Agha Ghani, chief Eunuch of Mohammed Ali Mirza, had a panel sculptured representing Mahommed Ali Mirza sitting on a golden chair with his son Heshmet-ed-Dowleh in front of him and another of his sons (Emad-ed-Dowleh) behind. To quote Nasr-ed-Din Shah “Agha Ghani has had his disgraceful figure cut in the rock behind that of Heshmet-ed-Dowleh and has in reality spoiled the look of this arch by this atrocious sculpture This addition to the arch is painted in gorgeous colours. Close by can be seen another excavation or recess which has bean begun but was never finished. Near the large reservoirs opposite the arches are two capitals and what remains of a large statue the features of which can no more be discerned. This statue is held in great veneration by the Kurds, who deposit offerings at its feet when they suffer from fever and other ailments. The two capitals have on two of their sides, a figure of Ormuzd holding circlets. They are supposed to be fire-worshippers’ altars. Similar ones have been found in Bisutun. We may here mention the well known legend of Farhad and Shirin accord ing to which Farhad would have undertaken all these works and many others extending all over Persia for the love of Shirin, and finally com mitted suicide when Khosroe’s messenger brought him the false news of Shirin’s death. Inscription on the left hand side. Image of the worsliipper of Mazda, the King b hapur, King of Kings of Iran and Aniran (countries outside of Iran), whose origin is from the Gods, the son of the worshipper of Mazda, the King Shapur, King of Kings, of Iran and Aniran, whose origin is from the Gods, the grandson of the King Hormazda, King of Kings. Inscription on the right hand side. This is the image of the -worshipper of Mazda, the King Shapur, King of Kings of Iran and Aniran, whose origin is from the Gods, the son of the worshipper of Mazda, the Kirg Hormazda, King of Kings of Iran and Aniran, whose origin is from the Gods, the grand son of Narcis, King of Kings.TAK-I-GER REH— Half way between Kerind and Sar-i-pol-i-Zobab is an old Roman-looking arch of great antiquity. There are neither designs nor inscriptions. The name is derived from a Tak ^ arch and Gerreh ” the name of one of Khosroe^s officers. The name of Gerreh frequently occurs in the old Kurduh legends. In 1834 Mr. J. B. Eraser wrote: “This pass bears the traces of Khosroe Parviz. At the foot there is a caravanserai built by him, now ruinous., but remarkable, for being wholly covered in, a mode of building these edifices, for the most part, unusual in Persia. And about half way up, there is an arched recess called the Tak-i-Khosroe, or Tak-i-Gerreh, built of marble slabs of large size, and the ornaments of which though very much defaced, are quite in the style attributed to this king. Little sculpture indeed re mains ; but there are some large slabs in the hack of the arch which appear to have been intended to receive some design. There is also a twisted rope-like border with several fragments of cornices which lock like the “Roman school but the whole is too ruinous to admit of its design being more accurately traced. What the arch may have been intended for, it is now hard to guess. Perhaps it may have recorded the date when the road was repaired or made more easy by the great Khosroe, for even yet it bears traces of former care and labour, in the removal of points of jutting rock, and the remains of bits of parapet; and doubt,ess that monarch and his court, from the neighbourhood of Ctesiphon and Dastjird, must have made great use of the road. Possibly it may have marked a spot where Khosroe himself rested in his ascent, and where he desired that others should have the power of doing so at their ease. It is, at present, quite detached from any other building, an isolated piece of mason-work, but tolling of power and skill beyond what is met in these degenerate days ” On the occasion of Nasr-ed-Din Shah’s journey to Kerbela, the Persian engineers under Gasteiker Khan, who had been told to repair the road, abandoned the obi Sassanian road and adopted a new route much inferior to the old one. Of the road at this point the following is what was written by Sir H. Rawlinson : “ The pass of Tak-i-Gerreh is on the road from Zohab to Ker- manshah. The ascent from the north-west side commences about 2 ^ miles from the Khan of Sar-i-po!-i-Zohab, and is rather laborious over a zigzag and very rough road formed of loose masses of fallen rock and large bould ers of stone ; like gigantic pebbles. The elevation of the road may be 20°, and in its present state it is certainly ill-adapted for the passage of either troops or artillery. A little labour and expense would, how 7 ever, place it in an efficient state. r lhe ascent of the most difficult part of the pass occupies exactly an hour from the Bishiveh plain. Half way up the pass stands a venerable arch of white marble, from which its name, Tak-i-Gerreh. It is no doubt of very great antiquity, but bears neither inscription nor design. Quitting the angular turns which the road takes on the ascent of the pass, it enters the narrow defile or gorge which severs the higher range of Mount Zagros from the lofty crest of the Band-i-Noah chain. This chain is the most westerly of the Persian mountains, and forms the great barrier between the alluvial plains of Assyria, east of Tigris, now termed Irak-i- Arabi and the mountainous districts of Persia. The scenery at this point328 becomes grand; on eitlipr hand the dark foliage of the oak overspreading the sid^s and summits of the mountains, is here and there relieved by a bare abutting ^rag. The road continues to ascend through the gorge in a general direction of 13U°, until it arrives at the village and Khan of Sur- khadizeh, whence it proceeds over a very rough road, and so narrow at times that caravans are compelled to proceed in single file. In two hours it . arrives at the ruins of the fort of Sar-i-Mil, anciently called Tur. From Surkhadizeh to this place the general bearing is 135°. Thence to Keriud is over a plain.” The road between Pa-i-Tak and Main-Tak has recently been built as whakf bv a pilgrim. The elevation of the pass of Tak-i-Gerreh, the ancient gate of Zagros, is given iu the Survey Department Map as 4, 280 feet. TAKIEII —Zir-Darband.

A Kurdish tribe of Kermanshah numbering some 2,500 families. Their chief is Mohammed Reza Khan Zahir-ul-Mulk, whose grandfather Mostapha Guli Khan was Governor of Kermanshah before Mohamed Ali Mirza. The Zengenehs are divided as follows Taifeh Kendouleh • •• ... Hassan Khan. „ Namivand • • « ... Hajji Rustam Khan. „ Namivand ... Hajji Rustam Khan and Mhdi Kehan „ Kerkuki • • • Sultan. ... Ali Khan Sultan. „ Chehri • tt ... Mohamed Taki Khan Yavar. „ Shamshir Chubin • • t ... Mohammed Hassan llbeghi. „ Bahtyaravand • tt • t • The Kendulehi and Chehri are sedentary at Kenduleh and Chehr. The other Zengenehs have their Yeilaks in the plains of Mahidasht and Talandasht. Their Keshlaks are near Shirvan. By their mild and equitable rule the family of the Zahir-ul-Mulk have been able to keep the chief ship of this tribe for more than two centuries. The Zengenehs are known for their attachment to their ruling family and are said to obey blindly any orders the latter may give them. The regiment known as the Zengeneh regiment is composed as follows Kenduleh, 2 companies. Osmanavad, 1 company. Shamshir Chubin, l company. Namivand, 2 companies. Kerkuki, 1 company, Che! iri ; 1 company.» 343 Most of the Zengeneli country is milkyat, Kenduleh is Khalesseh or Crown property. The Zengenehs are said to be able to turn out 200 sowars or horsemen. Regarding the Zengeneh of Kermanshah, Mr. T. C. Plowden says About 300 families of this tribe occupy portions of the great Mahidasht plain; other families are settled at Talandasht, and at Harasam, some 25 miles to the west of Kermanshah town. Some 200 families are settl ed in the plains at the foot of the Parrao hills to the north of Kermanshah, and another small detachment at Chehr to the east of Kermanshah, towards Hersin. There are 2 ,COO families in all. The present (1880) head of the Zengeneh tribe is Mohamed Reza Khan, Zahir-ul-Mulk, whose grandfather, Mustafa Kuli Khan was once Governor or Kerman* shah. Zahir-ul-Mulk appears to be a stupid, good natured man, and he is said to be liked by his people, over whom he exercises a mild rule. As Sartip of the Zengeneh and Nanekali tribes, he maintains for service of the State one regiment of infantry and 150 cavalry, I saw the in fantry under canvas outside the walls of Kermanshah. They had just been mobilised, and were under orders for the frontier. The men were miserably dressed, and could not for a moment compare with the Turkish Infantry at Baghdad. They were armed with German muskets. The Zen geneh country is milkyat; it yields nothing to the State, for the land revenue from it is absorbed in paying the expenses of the foot and horse levies under Zahir-ul-Mulk’s command.” Not only does the Zengeneh country yield nothing to the State, for the land revenue from it is absorbed in paying the expenses of the military contingents supplied, but Zahir-ul* Mulk draws annually on the Kermanshah Government to balance his accounts. The Zengenehs are Shiahs, The cavalry under Zahir-ul-Mulk is formed as follows - Nanekali ... ... 50 horsemen. Ahmadavand Behtui ... 100 „ The real tribe of Zengenehs only consists of a very limited number of families and is divided in Zengenehs who inhabited the plain of Mahidasht a few farsakhs to the east of the caravanserai of Mahidasht, and of Namiavands who inhabit the villages of Namiavand about 4 or 5 farsakhs to the west of the said caravanserai. The rest of the tribe is composed of small tribes and of villages who through having to supply contingents to the Zengeneh regiment have in some sort of way got attached to the tribe. The Zengeneh tribe to the east of the caravanserai of Mahidasht is divided into Taifeh Chururishi— Nujubi. Kutkavandi. Gezafi. Karavanei. Sarpuzeli. Gavmiziji. Kbalilani. Mussanaiinji. Gandabei.345 &amp;IMKAN, ZEMKAN or ZAMKAN-RUD— A river of western Kermanshali, forded 30 miles west of Kermansliah, on the road to Gahwarreh and Kerind. The road pursues its bank for some distance. Its water is unwholesome. The Zimkan-rud rises at Sar-Tang-Biwanij, at about 1 farsakh from Tushami, between that place and Biwanij. ZIR-DARBAND— BuLUKor District of Zir-Darband also called Mian Darbahd or Bilavar* This district extends from the district of Baladeh to the province of Kurdistan, and to the districts of Kuliai and Pusht-Darband or Bala- Darband. The Governor is Mohamed Khan Ahmadavand, Fath-ul-Mamalek. The inhabitants are mostly Ahmadavand Behtui. “ This district is a plain watered by the Ab-i-Razawar, and contains some 23 to 30 hamlets, averaging from 10 to 30 houses apiece, one of which is Kaklistan, a halting place on the road to Senneh, some 16 miles from Kermanshah, , A valley in the Kermanshah Province between Kaklistan and Kamiaran, which is watered throughout its whole length by the Ab-i-Razawar, Various Kurdish tribes amongst which the Ahmadavaod Betui and theNanekali are the most important, have their summer pastures in this valley. The northern end of the valley closes in and forms the defile of Tang* i-Khornawazan.”— [Plow den),349 The revenue of 6-6tlis of Karambast and of £-6ths of Razlansar Have been deducted from the account of Bala and Zir-Darband and added to the account of Zahir-ul-Mulk.

See Plain of Zeliri or Zeviri. ZOHAB—Zokab. A small village of some 30 bouses situated on tbe mins of an extensive town. Of this place Sir H. Bawlinson, writing some 50 years ago, said : “the town of Zohab was built a hundred years ago by a Turkish pasha and tbe Government continued to be hereditary in his family till the con quest of the Pashalik by tbe Persians. Tbe capital was surrounded by^ a mud wall and may have at first contained about 1,000 houses, from its frontier position it has been exposed to constant spoliation in the wars * between Turkey and Persia, and is now a mass of ruins with scarcely 200 inhabited houses/' The Persians say that during the war under Mohamed Ali Mirza Zohab furnished to the Turks 1,000 horsemen clad in chain armour. “ The climate of Zohab is proverbially unwholesome, and the water though clear and not unpleasant to the taste, contains some pernicious mineral component that, if indulged in for a short time only, seriously affects the traveller. To the natives, however, it is not so baneful, but they are, nevertheless, aware of its bad qualities, for they recommend a raw onion to the stranger before a draught is indulged in. The waiter of the Shir wan Holvan and Zimkan is alike deleterious, both to men and cattle; so indeed are with few exceptions the whole of the springs which have their origin in this part of the Zagros range. Fevers are very pre valent, caused by the marshy nature of the district; and excepting amongst the nomad tribes but few individuals wear an aspect of health. During the summer, the heat is excessively oppressive, and the myriads of annoying insects that infect the locality are represented as almost beyond indurance. A cooler atmosphere can, however, be reached in a few hours, and that luxury ice is attainable all the year round by sending to tbe mountains above/ 5 (llawlmson — Jones).

The largest district of the province of Kermansnah and formerly a pashalik under Turkish rule. This district is really under the authority of Mansoor-ul-Mulk, Amir Toman, hut Kalleh Sabzi and Kasr-i-Shinn are excluded from his rule and form a separate Governorship, which is now in the hands of Shir Khan Samsam-ul-Mamalek. The Bajlans occupy the territory which extend from Kasr-i-Sbirin (north) to the frontier. South of Kasr-i-Shirin, extending up to Luristan, are the garmsirs of the Kalhurs, and nearer to Kasr-i-Shirin the garmsirs of the Sinjabis. The plain of Zohab is practically deserted in summer. There are hut few Tillages, some of them, such as Bishkan, inhabited by Bajlans, and others, such as Zohab, inhabited by Jaffs. North of the plain of Zohab is the plain of Sarkalleh, which is the garmsir of the two branches of Jaffs who are under the Gurans. Rich speaks of a village named Sarkelleh, 9 miles east of Zohab, but the plain has no village in it now. North of this plain are the plains of Hoorin and Sheikhan, inhabited by Sharafbainis. These plains extend up to the frontier. The plain of Zohab is very well irrigated ; the greater part of it up to Sar-i*p&gt;l is turned into rice fields. The plain of Sarkalleh is no more under cultivation. The plains of Hoorin and Sheikhan are very well irrigated, and yield a large supp y of grain and rice. The whole district is in constant fear of invasion by the Jaffs. Against the Jaffs Kader Aga Bajlam has a post of 50 horsemen at Bishkant a kal leading from the north of the plain of Zohab to the plain of Sarkalleh, Aziz Leg Sharafbaini receives monetary subsidies from the Government of Kermanshahto maintain 100 horsemen, and Aziz Khan Bajlan is posted at Karatu with 100 horsemen. The Bajlans und r Persian rule barely number 200 families. Their chiefs a'e Aziz Khan at Kuretu and Kader Aga at B shkan. Kader Aga and Aziz Kh in are constantly at feud one with the other. Kader Aga’s son was killed iu March last. To prevent the frequent recurrence of fights and effusion of blood the present Governor of Kermansbah has removed Kader Aga from Bishkan to Knr tu, thus separating the two rival families. The Bajlans are Sunnis. ^ ShavafLaini.—ThQ Sharafbainis, whose chief is Aziz Beg (his residence being at Hoorin), number some 1,000 families. They speak the Jaff dialect and are Sunnis. They are probably a branch of the great Jaff tribe. They say that they came from Mosul to Persia during the reign of the Suffavi monarchs. Sinjahi. Under Shir Khan, Samsam-ul-Mamalek. Their garmsirs are ^ ween Kasr Shiiin and the Turkish frontier, their yeilaks north of Mah.das )t plain. The real Sinj ibis number barely 500 families, but with other nomads who have joined them at a later period and with the sedentary population of their villages, their number is said to reach something like 4,000 families, t hey are of the Aliullahi persuasion. They supply 200 horsemen t&gt; the Government.

The Govern ment House is built of stone and on a hill to the south-west of the town and is meant as a stronghold in case of attack. Kasr-i-Shirin is 103 miles distant from Kermaushah. Zohab. —Latitude 34° 35' 22 v N —A small v llage of some 30 houses situated on the ruins of an extensive town. Of this place Sir H. Rawlinson writing some 50 years ago said : ‘‘the town of Zohab was built 100 years ago by a Turkish Pasha, and the Government continued to be hereditary in his family till the conquest of the Pashalik by the Persians, The capital was surrounded by a mud wall, and may have at first contained about 1,000 houses. Emm its frontier position it has been exposed to constant spoliation in the wars between Turkey and Persia, and is now a mass of ruins with scarcely 200 inhabited houses/’ The Persians say that during the war under Mohammed AH M rza Zohab furnished to the Turks 1,0 0 horsemen clad in chain armour. Of the district of Zohab Pawlison said : “It is bounded on the north west by the course of the Piver Dial i, on the east bv the mountains, and on the sooth by the stream of Halwan. It formed one of the 10 pashaliks dependent upon Bagdad until about 60 years ago, when Muhammed Ali Mirza, prince of Kermanshah, annexed it to the Crown of Persia. By the treaty concluded between Persia and the Porte in 1823 it was stipulated that the districts acquired by either party during the war should be respectively surrendered and352 that the ancient frontier line should be restored, which had been established in the time of the Safavi monarchs. According to a subsequent treaty Zohab ought certainly to have been given up to the Turkish authorities, but Persia had neither the will to render this act of justice, nor had the Pasha of Bagdad the power to enforce it, and Zohab, although still claimed by the Porte, has thus remained to the present day in possession of the Grovernment of Kermanshah. “ Zohab having been acquired in war is Khalesseh, or Crown land ; it has been usually farmed by the Government of Kermanshah at an annual rent ... to the chief of the Guran tribe, whose hardy Ilayats inhabit the adjoining mountains. . . . The amount of the revenue must depend, in a great measure, upon the value of rice and corn, its staple articles of produce ; but in years of plenty, when the price of these commodities is at the lowest possible rate, a considerable surplus will still remain in the hands of the lessee. The revenue system of this district is simple and more favourable to the cultivators than in most parts of Persia. It is thought derogatory to the chief to take any part of the cultivation into his own immediate hands. He distributes grain to his dependents, and at the harvest receives as his share of the produce of rice two-thirds of corn in consequence of the water consumed in its irrigation, which is the property of the landlord or of Government, and is rarely to be obtained without considerable expense and labour. “ The rice grounds of Zohab are chiefly irrigated by an artificial canal, brought from the Hal wan River, a distance of about 10 miles. The canal is said to have been an ancient work, but was repaired and rendered available for its present purposes only 100 years ago by the same Pasha who subse quently built the town of Zohab. “ The revenue accruing to the chief averages 10,000 tomans.” Sir H. Rawlinson estimated the produce of the district of Zohab at 2,000 kbarvars of rice and at 2,500 kharvars of wheat. “ Under the Turkish rule Zohab yielded, with its dependencies, an annual sum of 30,000 tomans but it then included several fertile and exten sive districts, which are now detached from it, and there were also above 2,000 raiyats resident upon the land, whereas at present this number is reduced to about 300 families, and the great proportion of the cultivation is in the hands of Guran Ilyats, who, after sowing the grain in the spring, move up to their summer pastures among the mountains, and leave only a few labourers in the plain to get in the crops. The soil of Zohab is naturally very rich, but owing to the little care bestowed on its cultivation, a tenfold return is considered as good. Manure is never employed to fertilise the lands. After the production of a rice crop, the soil is allowed to lie fallow for several years, in order to recover its strength, or is only sown with a light grain. The interval between two rice crops upon the same ground is never less than seven years, but even this is said to exhaust the soil. Wherever the extent of the lands willgdmit of it, an interval of 15 years is allowed. (( Scarcely a fifth of the arable land in this district is now under culti vation, and certainly the revenues might he raised, with proper care, to ten times their present amount.” The district of Zohab is at present rented to the chief of the Gurans for the sum of 12,000 tomans.ZEFTGUL.

Babino to whom all the notes were surrendered—no copy being kept. Translatedfrom the French— At 1J farsakh from Kermanehah and at £ farsakh on the left of the road is the village of Cheshmeh Sefid, built at the foot of the Zenguelian Moun tain. The inhabitants have given the name of their village to the part of the mountain immediately behind the village. The village contains about 60 houses and has orchards and gardens. The cemetery is near the Mahi- dasht road. A path leads ft'om the Mnhidasht Road to the village, the proprietor is Hajji Cheragh Ali, and the inhabitants are the so called Sarabis. At farsakhs from Kermanshah at £ farsakh on the right of the road is the village of Dereka ; on account of quarrels, the villagers have divided into 3 parts and formed 3 villages. The first village, which is the original village, is at £ farsakh from the road and is composed of 20 houses. The two other villages are behind the mountain and number from 30 to 45 houses. The proprietors are Vekil-ed-Dowleh, Hajji Hussien and Mohamed Kazem Beg. Cultivation : grain. A path starting from the foot of the .Zenguelian Mountain goes towards Derekeh and Kalleh Hassan Beg. The Zenguelian Mountain is crossed at 2 farsakhs from Kermanshah and ends half a farsakh further on. The name of the pass through this mountain is Linal Kersh, at the entrance of the pass on the right is the cemetery of Derekeh. After the pass there is a vadey of 800 metres in width, terminated by a range of mountains, which also forms the first boundaries of the Mahidasht chain. At 200 metres on the left of the road, in the small valley above mentioned, is a village at the foot of the mountain, the name of this village is Tush-Latif; it belongs to Abol Gassem and numbers from 15 to 18 houses. A small stream has its source in the village and joins a rivulet which flows in the middle of the valley. There are three routes from Mahidasht to Kerrnanshah : the main route followed by all travellers and two other routes, one on the left and the other on the right of the main route, which are only used by villagers. One of these routes leaves the main route at 2 farsakhs from Mahidasht, passes through the small valley above mentioned, and thence to Tush Latif and Sarab :the other route leaves the main route in the Mahidasht plain- passes by Gardaneh Milleh-Chakhmagheh and reaches Siah-Kamar, at one farsakh from Kermanshah in the plain of Kermanshah. Siah-Kamar belongs to Imam-Jumeh. The plain of Mahidasht is about two farsakhs and a half in width and is ended by a range of mountains called Kuh-i-Lalaban which extends from Sar-Firuzabad to Gardaneh Kurkur. The Kub-i-Zenguelian is joined at Kumisheh, a village belonging to Seyyed Hassan Naghib, by a range of mountains which extends to Sar- Firuzabad.359 From Kurkur to Haftashian the distance is said to be 4 farsakhs fch * • to say from the spot where the Mahidasht-Harunabad road passes ^thr^ i? Kurkur to Haftashian, the distance is 4 farsakhs. The Kuh-i-Lalaban which ends at the Mahidasht-Harunabad road ‘ continued by the Gardaneh Kurkur which extends up to Gahwari 8 changing its name into Milleli-Meikhan (length 2 farshakhs), then int* Kal-i-Kazi (length ^ farsakh) and finally into Milleh-Kabud, this last mountain ending at Gahwareh. Gahwareh, which is at 6 farsakhs from Mahidasht, is the chief village of the Guran district and is inhabited by Gurans, The cultivation of Gahwarreh is tobacco and grain. The main road to Mahidasht crosses the plain at Mahidasht forming an angle of about 110° with the mountains which border the plain. The first village met in the plain of Mahidasht is Kumisheh situated at the foot of the mountain at 2 small farsakhs from the caravanserai of Mahidasht. Kumisheh belongs to Seyyed Abul-Gassem and numbers about 90 houses. Cultivation : grain. A small stream has its source in this village and joins the Merik river. In the small pass £ farsakh after leaving the Mahidasht plain on the wayto Harunabad onthe right is Chaharzabar sufla, which numbers 30' houses. In the pass quite near its end, flows the torrent of Chaharzabad which has 7 or 8 mills on its banks and which joins the Merik. The pass of Chaharzabar forms a military position of great strength and easily defensible. Its length is 1 farsakh. On leaving the pass one finds on the right the village of Chaharzahar Ulia, numbering about 10 houses of very poor villagers : only two families till the soil. The inhabitants are the Chaharzabari branch of Kalkor, their Katkhoda is Amin. At half a farsakh between the two villages of Chaharzabar, is the village Shah-Pasend, 7 bouses, Katkhoda Kahdar, inhabitants Lekks. Cultivation: grain. The Kurkur and Lalaban ranges of mountains are formed of three parallel ranges ; the first range borders the Mahidasht plain at about 1 farsakh from the caravanserai. The second and third ranges follow one another and are distant H farsakhs from the first range. The pass ends at? farsakh from the village of Chaharzabar Sufla. The pass has the shape of two funnels joined by the wide side, on leaving the pass there is a path which leaves the main road and is followed by foot-travellers. It passes by Larini and thence goes on to Harunabad. It is said to be one farsakh shorter than the main road. On leaving the Gardaneh Chaharzabar the main route forms a slight curve northwards and then strikes towards the plain of Zebiri to the south forming an angle of about 120° with the Kuh-i-Lalaban. The plain of Zebiri is limited on one side by the Kuh-i-Lalaban and by the Kuh-i-Kurkur, and on the opposite side by the Kuh-i-Darkbur and Nal-Shekan. This plain is the shape of an egg, the mountains limiting it joining in the shape of an oval. The plain is terminated to the east by the junction of the Sbian and Ali-Ber mountains.360 The length of the plain is about 3 farsakhs and its width in the centre | farsakb. On the left at the foot of the mountain is a village called Shuan numbering 40 houses ; proprietor, Vekil-ed-Dowleh, Cultivation : opium and grain. The yearly output of opium is 30 batmans.

The plain of Tejeris situated between the Nalshikan and Kemal-ed-din mountains. The road crosses this plain in a S. W. W. direction forming an angle of about 110° with the mountain. The road then goes over a succession of small hills and is scarcely pas sable for wheeled traffic. In front of the village are numerous cemeteries of nomads. In the plain to the right of the road the Larini division of Kalhors have their summer encampments. The village of Larini is at 1? farsakhs from Harunabad and at 500 metres to the right of the road. This village is inhabited in winter by the tribe of the same name. 50 houses. Cultivation: grain. The inhabitants pass the summer months under canvas. The plain of Raven in which is Harnnabad is ended by a range of moun tains which joins the Tang-i-Sandukeh range. This range extends for 1 i farsakhs up to Tush-Khoshkehand is cut by the Manglareh pass which is on the road from Harunabad to Gilan. The mountain at the foot of which are the villages of Harunabad and Bad- reh is named Guerreh-Abbas-Ali and extends from the Mahidasht-Harun- abad road up to £ farsakh further on than Harunabad and runs parallel to the Harunabad-Kerin road. The plain of Raven is 3 farsakhs in length. Harunabad is at 6 good farsakhs from Mahidasht and at 5 from Kerind. The distance from Badreh to Harunabad is i farsakh. Badreh, 40 houses. Cultivation: grain. Carpet-weaving. Proprietor: Amir Arslan Khan Saram-i-Nizam. Katkhoda Assad. Inhabitants are of the Badrei tribe who come from Baghdad.the end o£ the plain the road turns sharply S.W., crosses the Duzul mountain by the Gardaneh Javemergue which is about 1 kilometre in length Half-way up the pass the road turns south. On leaving the pass one enters the plain of Groawur bordered on the opposite side by the Kalajeh mountain. On leaving the pass the road takes a westerly direc tion. The plain of Goawur has a width of ^ farsakh. The plain gets narrower at 1 farsakh from the Tang-i-Javemergue and only measures 1 kilometre in width. The plain is limited on the left by the Kuh-i-Kechel which joins the Kuh-i-Kalajeh. The road crosses the plain and reaches the Kuh-i-Kechel. The Kuh-i-Kechel runs S.E. to N. E.—The road is parallel to the mountain. The river Kamga runs through this plain. It rises near the old ruined caravanserai of Sarkuh Kamga., passes Kalkosh and joins the Howlan. The Kuh-i-Kechel extends J farsakh further than Kalgosh and is con tinued by the Kuh-i-Molianeh. On the other side of Kalkosh is the Kuh-i- Kal-Amir-at the foot of which is Kalkosh. The plain inrwhich Kalkosh is situated is named Kifraur. Kalkosh is 4 farsakhs from Kerind and about 5 from Gilan and 6| from Harunabad. Kalkosh numbers 20 houses of the manishi division of Kalhors. Cultiva tion : grain. Sheep. Proprietors : Aziz Khan and Mehdi Khan. From the foot of the Kuh-Kechel to Kalkosh the distance is 2 farsakhs. The village has no Katkhoda, the chief of the division of the tribe being sole master. The villagers of Kalkosh are very poor. They only live on bread. The valley of Kifraur is | farsakh wide and follows a S. E.—N. W. direction. On leaving the Goawur plain and at the foot of the Kuh-i-Kechel one finds an old ruined Shah Abbasi caravanserai called Sar-kuh-Kamgah. From tbe caravanserai to Kalkosh the road runs along the right of the stream except at | farsakh from Kalkosh; here through a bend in the river tbe river has to be forded twice. Past Kalkosh tbe river deviates from the road, passes to the right and follows at 600 metres distance the Kala- mir mountain. The second road from Harunabad to Kalkosh is called Kazansheken frcm the name of a hill half-way between Harunabad and Kalkosh at 3 farsakhs from Kalkosh. From Kalkosh to Harunabad the distance is about 6^ farsakhs. The country within a radius of 6 farsakhs from Gilan is said to produce yearly 1,000 kharvars of rice. At farsakhs from Kalkosh the road crosses a pass in the Molianeh mountain. The plain of Kifraur extends i farsakh further than this pass. The pass is very difficult and is 2 kilometres in length. It took us 45 minutes to cover this distance. On leaving the pass the road takes a wes terly direction running on the side of the mountain about 500 metres above the plain. Through numberless turns it descends to the plain just beneath the end of the pass. It then takes a Westerly direction. The descent occupies half an hour and must be done on foot. Half farsakh further on the road crosses the plain of Pushteh in a S.W, direction and reaches the Kuh-i-Poshteh-Kuh which is 1 farsakh di 8 fa n t from the pass.Two kilometres from Kerevasheken one sees the ruins of a bridge Pol-i-Dota Kor (bridge of the two children). The road follows the river in a S. W. direction. From Kerevasheken to Dubruleh the distance is about 3 farsakhs. The plain of Saumar begins at the foot of Dubruleh and is limited on the Mendaii side by the mountain Kumehsang which forms the Turko-Persian frontier. The pass through which the Dubruleh-Mendali road winds its way is also named Kumehsang as well as the village in Turkish territory at £ farsakh further on to the left. The plain of Saumar has the form of an egg, the pointed end facing Mendaii. The distance from Dubruleh to the pass is 2 farsakhs. The road Mendaii Eivan follows the river on the side opposite to the one followed by the Gilan-Mendali road and leaves the Ab-i-Gangir just before reaching Eivan. The mountains bordering the plain of Saumar are about ' 50 metres high and can easily be passed. From the pass of Kumehsang to Mendaii the distance is | farsakh. Unfortunately on account of rain and storm Mr. Leleux was unable to eive a description of the road from Mendaii to Kasr-i-Sbirin through Persian territory. Kasr-i-Shirin. 160 houses.
