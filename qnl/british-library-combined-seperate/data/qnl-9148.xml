The main correspondents are the Department of Overseas Trade, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The file also contains a number of detailed reports from British officials, which were submitted to the Department of Overseas Trade.The first of these reports, dated 1931, relates specifically to cotton piece-goods, and consists of a general report by the British Vice-Consul at Bushire on the Arab coast market, and reports on local conditions from the Political Agents at Kuwait and Muscat, the Residency Agent, Shargah [Sharjah] (relating to Debai [Dubai] and the Trucial Coast), and the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain. Further general reports on economic conditions in the Persian Gulf by various British Vice-Consuls at Bushire, are dated 1934-37 (including a Department of Overseas Trade published version, for October 1934, folios 126-144). There are also other reports on local conditions, and general correspondence concerning economic conditions and the market for British goods. Papers from 1936 onwards show increasing awareness of the importance of oil in enhancing the potential economic significance of the Gulf states.The following correspondence is also of note:Folios 73-75, dated 1938, draw attention to the increasing market for Indian products and the potentially increasing field of employment for Indians in the Persian Gulf, particularly at Bahrain.Folios 66-69, dated 1942, concern the export of tobacco to the Persian Gulf.Folios 57-64, dated 1946, concern difficulties experienced by merchants in Kuwait in obtaining British goods.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Department of Overseas Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic conditions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
