Secondly, goods up to value of two lakhs of rupees annually for King HinSard's personal use to be passed through free provided they receive commun ication (I presume this would be sent through proper oiiicial channel) from Sa^udi Government informing them that goods are for King, iiiiraly, concession of overside delivery from steamers uas hitherto been limited to cons igniaents jf 1,000 bags or over.

After compliments:- On the conclusion of the negotia tions which have taken place between us I am direct^by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifah to express his pleasure at the suc cessful conclusion of our labours. His Excellency is of the opinion that it would now be useful to summurize the final result of our conversations which are as follows:- 2. The Saoudia-Arabia represen tatives made the following demands:- (a) That on cargo which is direct ly transhipped at sea either destined for the ports of the Kingdom of Saoudia-Arabia or exported from those ports to other countries there should be no customs duty. (b) That the Bahrain Government should make a reduction in the 2$ customs duty levied on cargo which is exported from Bahrain after itit has been landed in the Bahrain customs. (c) The Saoudia-Arabia repre sentatives mentioned the case of the s.s. f, Ahmedi n and stated that they hoped that the Bahrain Govern ment wiuld not take similar action in the future. (d) That the Bahrain Gove mi© nt would issue manifests to all boats leaving Bahrain for the ports of the Kingdom of Saoudia-Arabia. (e) That the Bahrain customs duty on dates exported from the Kingdom of Saoudia-Arabia should not be more than the customs duty on the dates of 'Iraq. 3. Conversation took place regarding duty on the cargo which is imported in the name of His Majesty King Abdulaziz bin Saoud. 4. To the demands enumerated above, the Bahrain Government repre sentatives replied as follows With regard to (a) The Bahrain Government representatives stated that the Bahrain Government are unable to agree to this request. With regard to (b) The Bahrain Government representatives stated that the Bahrain Government are unable to do this. With regard to (c) The BahrainBahrain Government representatives stated that iiie Bahrain Governiaent hereby give the assurance that this would not be done by us in future. With regard to (d) The Bahrain Governcient representatives stated that the Bahrain Grovernment will in future issue manifests to all boats leaving Bahrain for the ports of the Saoudia-Arabia, provided that reciprocal action is taken by the Saoudia-Arabia Government, that is, that the £&gt;aoudia-Arabia Government will issue manifests to all boats leaving their ports for Bahrain. With regard to (e) The Bahrain Government representatives stated that the Bahrain Government were willing to charge customs duty at the rate of 5$&gt; on all dates imported into Bahrain from the ports of the ST Saoudia-Arabia and to charge 2^ less 1/8th on all dates directly tranship ped at sea and these customs dues shall be levied according to the current market price in Bahrain. With regard to 3. The Bahrain Government representatives stated that the Bahrain Government were prepared to waive all dues on cargo consigned to His Majesty King Abdul- aziz bin Saoud for his personal use,use, directly transhipped at sea, upto a total value of two lakhs of rupees. On this offer being coromunicated to H .I .King Abdulaziz bin Saoud, His Majesty replied that he waived this exemption for himself but would like this exemption to be for his people. In reply the Bahrain Government representatives agreed to the alterr native suggested by His Majesty and stated that the Bahrain G-ovemment would make instead of this a reduc tion of one eigMi in the customs duty on all cargo transhipped at sea, and destined for the ports of Saoudia-Arabia and vice versa, that is, on all cargo directly transhipped at sea, and from the ports of the Kingdom of the Saoudia- Arabia. 5. In addition to the above facilities the Bahrain Government representatives informed the ^aoudia- Arabia Government representatives that in view of the friendship which His Excellency Shaikh ^ir Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifah held towards His Majesty King Abdul-aziz bin Saoud, his government would be willing to make the following additional facilities, although itit had not been asked for by the Saoudia-Arabia representatives. The Bahrain Government agree to allow direct transhipment at sea of cargo if the number of packages is not less than 100 (one hundred) packages instead of the one thousand packages (the minimum number of packages which can now be transhipped at sea, direct, is one thousand packages). 6.

Good effect of agreement would in my opinion be almost destroyed if duration were fixed at less than five years. For one thing limitation suggested by Government of India would suggest that if lun Saud tried to develop Has Tanurah Bahrain Govern- -ment would consider themselves free after either fifteen months or two years to revert to AHMEDI pro- -cedure. This might be positive incentive to him not only to develop Ras Tanurah quickly but to endeavour to make direct trade independent of Bahrain even as a port of call.

Foreign Office telegram Ho.74 of May 8th BAHRAIN TRANSIT DUES 2. Two points on which our views are requested are (a) whether Saudi Government should now be informed that Bahrain undertaking regarding Ahmedi case should continue to apply indefinitely irrespective of duration of remainder of agreement (vide paragraph 4 of telegram under reference). (b) Insertion of clause regarding duration as suggested in paragraph 6. 3. Regarding (b) we agree to clause as drafted and have no comments. Regarding (a) we see following strong objections (1) undertaking has been offered only as part of general settlement which in fact gives valuable con cession to Saudi Government and secures nothing of any value for Bahrain. Latter Government cannot therefore unjustifiably be pressed to surrender in perpetuity what is admitted to be the only effective weapon in her armoury against eventual strsingulation of her transit trade. Such surrender would operate against her even in the event of disappearance of present Saudi regime.-2- (2) We are aware that Foreign Office hold strong views about procedure adopted in Ahmedi case but have never admitted that that action was contrary to international usage (even if that is applicable in present case) or in capable of repitition in certain circumstances. In this view we understood we had your support. C3) Even should refusal to give such permanent under taking render negotiations wholly abortive we do not see any particular disadvantages to Bahrain. 4.

It woi4d in my opinion be equally regrettable from the point of view of our relations with Ibn Satid if (a) We aid anything to suggest Ahme^i incident might be repeatea at six months notice, or (b) We allowed what has been one of the most promising attempts to settle some of •outstanding qijestions to end in nothing. 2. May I suggest following middle solution which turns however on your attitude towards Sau-i propooalfor prolongation of valiaity of ireaty of Jeada for ten years ? (a) undertaking to be given that Alime^i Incident will not be repeated while treaty of Jedda remains in force. (b) Other points to be embodied in separate exchange of notes with duration clause as propjsed in your telegram 74.

The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3057 (v*THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANWIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). July 18, 1935, CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4421/191/25] Record of First Part of Fifth Meeting Harnza Foreign Office on 15, 1935. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. Ren del. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Sir A. Ryan. Arabian Minister for Foreign Mr. Ward. Affairs). Mr. Malcolm. 4. ~ Mr . RENDEL suggested that the meeting should discuss in the first place the situation arising out of the recent conference at Bahrein to consider the question of transit dues on goods imported into the Hasa province of Saudi Arabia through the port or territorial waters of Bahrein. He recalled that the conference had reached a considerable measure of agreement, and that it had subsequently been agreed between Sir A. Ryan and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at Jedda that its results should be embodied in a formal exchange of notes between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Government. As regards the substance of the agreement there appeared to be only two points outstanding, viz. :— (1) Whether the Saudi Government were prepared to give an assurance that reciprocal action would be taken by them for the issue of manifests to all vessels leaving their ports for Bahrein. (2) What should be the duration of the formal agreement embodying the results attained at the conference. Mr. Rendel did not think that there would be any difficulty over (1), but (2) was more complicated. The Government of Bahrein felt that they could not bind themselves in perpetuity for a long fixed period not to alter their transit dues, they wished to be able to regain their freedom of action in the event of the economic situation undergoing some unexpected change. In the circumstances His Majesty's Government had suggested that the duration of the agreement might be defined by the following formula :— ' Should economic conditions in Bahrein at any time render necessary a reconsideration of these concessions the Bahrein Government will inform the Saudi Arabian Government and will not withdraw any of these concessions until six months after giving such notice.' This would mean that the agreement would run on indefinitely until six months after notice had been given to terminate its provisions; the Bahrein Government were quite prepared, if the Saudi Government wished it, to amend the formula so as to give the Saudi Government reciprocally a similar right to bring the agreement to an end. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had, however, pointed out to Sir A. Ryan that, while the Saudi Government had no objection to the agreement not being of perpetual duration, they could not agree that any such limitation should apply to the right of vessels calling at Bahrein to take cargo on direct to the Hasa coast. They accordingly desired that the undertaking given by the Bahrein delegates, that the Bahrein Government would not in future repeat the procedure they had adopted in the case of the steamship hfnedi, should be made perpetual, irrespective of the duration of the rest of the agreement. The insistence of the Saudi Government on this last point had led to a temporary delay in embodying the results of the conference in a general agree ment, but Mr. Rendel was now authorised to give Fuad Bey a categorical assurance, on behalf of His Majesty's Government and of the Government of Bahrein, that there would in the future be no penalisation at Bahrein (as m the [456 s—1]case of the steamship A hmedi) of vessels carrying cargo direct to the Saudi coast of the mainland. This point could be dealt with, and the above assurance confirmed, in a separate note. The assurance given by the Bahiein delegates on this point would be perpetual in character, and he hoped that this would leave the way clear for the projected exchange of notes. FUAD BEY HAMZA said that his Government would, of course, have no objection to instituting a system of manifests for vessels sailing between their ports and Bahrein; and he thought that the assurance which the Bahrein Government were ready to give would solve the difficulty arising out of the A hmedi case, to which he knew that King Abdul Aziz attached special importance. But he was not himself familiar with the present state of the question, having left Jedda before the latest discussions, and would therefore have to refer the matter to the King. Some discussion followed upon the procedure which should be followed in drawing up the formal agreement to embody the results of the conference. It was agreed that the perpetual undertaking with reference to the case of the steamship A hmedi should be contained in a separate note, while the other results of the conference would be embodied in an exchange of notes between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Government, to be exchanged either in London or in Jedda. The Foreign Office would endeavour to produce the necessary drafts for Fuad Bey to see before he left England on the 22nd July, It was, however, explained to Fuad Bey that this might not after all be possible, since the wording of the translation of 'the Bahreini delegates' letter to the Saudi delegates, recording the position reached in the local conference, appeared to contain some small ambiguities, such as the technical department of the Foreign Office might object to incorporating in an official Anglo-Saudi exchange of notes. The Foreign Office would, however, do their best; but the actual exchange of notes would, in any case, have to be postponed, as Fuad Bey would have to submit the drafts to his Government for their approval.

In discussion with Foreign Office which Loch attended on same day, it was explained that words 'within Bahrein territorial waters' after 'transshipped at sea' might give rise to serious difficulty since, in practice, transshipment takes place up to about 16 miles out from Bahrein. In deference to this objection Foreign Office agree to withdraw words 'within Bahrein territorial waters' but explained that it was out of the question, for legal reasons, to use in this connection, in an official Note communicated to a Foreign Government by His Majesty's Government, the unqualified phrase 'at sea'. 3. The amendment explained in my telegram No. 2324 dated 24th July, 1935, was therefore adopted. u The issue of the above has been authorised. (s&lt;l) j* waliuai*By Air Mail. P.Z.

From the letter to M .Zada—a copy of which was s - gaivert esq#&gt; etc *» etc., etc., Jedda. enclosed in my despatch No.227, of the 8th August, you will see that it was Fuad Bey himself who suggested that copies of the draft notes should be communicated to him for his personal concurrence before concurrence in them was invited from his Government through His Majesty's Legation at Jedda. This suggestion was adopted mainly with a view to expediting, in the interests of the Saudi Government themselves, the formal conclusion of the matter. In view of the foregoing facts, I can only regard the attitude which Fuad Bey, according to m .Zada's letter, has adopted as most disappoint jpi if not actually discourteous. On the other hand I realise that Fuad Bey's position with his own Government is by no means unassailable, and I do not wish to take any action which/ dOPY SENT TOwhich might further weaken it. I do not therefore propose |i further to advert to this aspect of the matter. 3. It is nevertheless undesirable to run the risk of any ^ further delay by taking the matter up again through the Saudi Arabian Minister in London. I shall accordingly be glad if you will now formally communicate the draft notes (copies of which were enclosed in my despatch Ho.214 of the 25th July) to the Saudi Government for their concurrence, and inform me by telegraph of the substance of their reply when received. You should at the same time explain orally or by personal letter that His Majesty's Government had hoped to be able to agree on the terms of the drafts with Fuad Bey Hamza but that it proved impossible to do so, and that some delay has resulted* X am, c •, (Sgnd.)

WITH reference to my telegram No. 211 of the 18th November, relative to the Bah rein transit dues and the notes exchanged with the Saudi Arab Govern- mentj I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of the two notes addressed by me to the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 16th November, and translations of the replies, signed by Fuad Bey Hamza, and dated the 17th November, which reached me from Mecca on the 18th November. 2. Upon the receipt of Bahrein's telegram No. 164 of the 15th November, I got into touch early on the 16th November with Fuad Bey Hamza by telephone, as he had left Jedda for Mecca, preparatory to leaving for Riyadh, on the previous evening. I explained the suggested alterations in respect of both points in your telegram No. 151 of the 13th November. He at once accepted the substitution suggested in the second paragraph of your telegram and a satisfactory Arabic translation was agreed between us. 3. Fuad Bey raised no objection to the use in the English text of the word ' off ' in the phrase ' anchoring off Bahrein,' but as it would be difficult to render this sense exactly in Arabic, without a cumbrous and possibly dangerous circumlocution, I share the view that no change in the Arabic texts could well be introduced. The Arabic, which my senior interpreter translates as ' at,' is literally ' in Bahrein,' and I pointed out to Fuad Bey that the use of the word ' in ' in English would be unsuitable and inexact. Fuad Bey also accepted the suggestion to insert the phrase in parenthesis ' (that is, loaded and unloaded direct from ships into dhows and dhows into ships anchoring off Bahrein) ' between ' trans-shipped ' and ' without being landed ' at the end of paragraph 2 of the main note. He raised no objection to this interpolation being omitted from paragraphs 4 and 6 of the English text, but demurred to its omission from those paragraphs of the Arabic text, on account of the alleged lack of a satisfactory rendering of the word ' trans-shipped ' in Arabic. As you were of the opinion that the paraphrase, though clumsy, was not objectionable, I did not make any difficulty, but caused our Arabic text to conform. In regard to the A hmedi note, I omitted the interpolation in both English and Arabic and the Saudi text follows suit. 4. With regard to paragraph 4 of your telegram No. 131, Fuad readily undertook to modify the form of the Saudi draft note, as, indeed, I had suggested on the 11th November (my despatch No. 323 of the 12th November, paragraph 7 (a) ). 5. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to Government of India, Bushire and Bahrein, and to the two latter posts I am forwarding copies of the Arabic text of the Saudi notes in addition. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure 1. Mr. Calvert to the Amir Feisal, Sau Your Royal Highness, (After Compliments.) 16, 1935, I HAVE the honour to inform your Royal Highness, in accordance with instructions addressed io me by His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have [581 i—1]» fib. tafeen cognisance of the proceedings at the conference held in March and April of this year between delegates of the Governments of Saudi Arabia and of Bahrein, and that they are prepared to enter into an agreement, on behalf of and with the consent of the Government of Bahrein, regarding the treatment of goods destined for or exported from ports in Saudi Arabia, and carried in ships calling at Bahrein, on the following basis :— 1.

I would suggest that as soon as I am informed official ly of the completion of the agreement that, if His Jfejesty f s Minister at Jedda has no objection, I should be authorised to write to the Amir of Hasa that, under instructions from His Majesty»s Government, I am informing him that I have commni- cated news of the signing of the agreement to the Bahrain Govern ment, who will put the agreement into force at once. I am arranging with the Bahrain Government in the meantime to make /what!i U /tfZ) 2. what arrangements are necessary. I should be grateful for orders bj' - telegram as it would be unfortunate if any delay in implementing the agreement were to be laid at the door either of ourselves or of the Bahrain Government, t iiA 5. In this connection I would refer to letter No:6/l/i8 dated the 17th Rajab 1354 (15th October 1S35) from Shaikh Yusuf Yasin to Mr. Calvert, in which the Sa'udi Government contested the claim of His Majesty's Government that the Sa'udi Arab Government are not entitled to correspond direct on official matters with the Arab States in special relations with His Majesty^ Government. I do not think that the present letter is one to which exception can well be taken as the Sa'udi Arab and Bahrain representatives were put into touch with each other by us and as the letter merely contains a request to put into operation locally the agreement which was reached. At the same time in principle it is open to objection, and I think that, if His Majesty 1 s Minister has no objection, our claim can best be emphasised by my commnnicating with the Amir of Hasa as suggest ed in the second paragraph above. 4.

I am disturbed about point 2 of telegram dated 1st January, Fo, 1, from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and feel that before action is taken that I should place two local considerations before you. Shaikh would not, I think, have any objection to Saudi Government publishing both notes if they wish to do so. But I feel that Shaikh and his family may object strongly to notes being registered with League of Eations, of which Bahrain is not a member, as they are likely to ( mut, 1 bring Bahrain thus within purview of league as weakening her position against Persian claim. In any case it would seem necessary to consult the Shaikh and if matter gets out it may give certain persons opportunity to stir up demand for entry of Bahrain into League which might prove embarassing both here and elsewhere along Arab littoral.

The Shaikh of Bahrain and the Governor of Hasa do not correspond at all on important official matters (though they ®' change greetings and occasionally do little kindnesses to each other's friends) and the present Shaikh is, I think, pu ictiliouo about drawing to my notice any attempt to draw him into correspondence on formal affairs; as, for example, in the present case(see the correspondence ending with the second paragraph of your telegram No.1029 dated the 19th December 1935). 3. I am a little anxious about the possible effect of Sir An Andrew Ryan's mention to Fuad Bey that he would not object to c correspondence on routine matters between the Director of Vr cCustoms the in Hasa and subordinate authorities in Bahrain, the Director f Customs and his subordinates in Bahrain do not correspond direct with any of the Sa'udi Customs authorities, and I feel that ( though elsewhere such a course would be perfectly natural) it would be preferable not to suggest, even casually, that they should do so here, has in the circumstances on this Coast such correspondence might easily lead to difficulties. 4. I write this with some diffidence, but T feel sure that Sir Andrew will appreciate that it is very easy to disturb our curious 'live and let live' state of affairs. honourable Lieut-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political ''esident in the Persian ^ulf, Bushire.\ D.CLHQ.C/SO , Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, H.M.S.Fowey. 0/ 111 Dated the 9th March 1936. (p Could you please refer to your demi-official letter dated the 8th March 1936 on the subject of a despatch of the 7th January 1936 from Sir Andrew Ryan to the Foreign Office on the subject of the Bahrain Transit Dues, and our conversation. We agreed that the best way to prevent any possible ill effects of direct correspondence between the Director of Customs in Hasa end subordinate authorities in Bahre in(i.e. Director of Customs), should this begin, would be for the Bahrain Director to be informed that he should show any such corres pondence to Belgrave, who on behalf of the Shaikh will show it to you. If any communicat ion is innocuous naturally no action will be taken. If, however, any comnunicati on is outside the routine matters envisaged by Sir Andrew Ryan you could bring it to my notice for necessary action.
