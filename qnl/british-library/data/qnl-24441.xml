However we have to take some thought and try and have our plans ready for the worst. 3. Your Express Letter bo.C/346 dated the 25th May 1939 gave your objections to my suggestion that we should inform the bhaikh of Debai that if he attacked Sharjah we would bombard his forces from a sloop. Ihe most important factor is Shaikh Said*s guarantee at the end of your paragraph 7. Personally I am doubtful as to whether, with all the goodwill in the world, he can carry out his guarantee. Arabs when fighting - and of course the attack on Sharjah would be a full blown show and not a mere skirmish become quite out of hand, and some of his men might well go to the aerodrome and fire on the fort, or worse still, on any •plane which happened to be on the aerodrome. 3harjah # s men might also get out of hand. 4. further, what would shaikh Said do if he took Sharjah ? Make himself Shaikh ? Whatever his ultimate aims are the immediate effects, which might last for a long time, would be disorder and continued insecurity at Sharjah. Nightman, Esquire, I.C.S. Political Agent, Bahrain. 5./2 5* is there any way in which we can bring pressure to bear on ttharjah to refuse continued asylum to M&amp;na and if the Abu i^habi plan falls through ? rwo ideas occur to mes (a) to give the shaikh of sharjah a warning in general terms - we cannot give him a direct order - that we consider he is creating unnecessary trouble, or/and (b) to inform him that as long as the state of insecurity in Shatjah and Debai due to his encouraging attitude towards Mana and Uo., continues, it will be necessary to withhold the rent (item ii) of Ks.800 P«r month and the personal subsidy (item iv) of Ks.500 per month under the Uivil Air Agreement with him of 22nd July 1932• ihe pay of the guards (item i) we would not stop as they would be required for guarding the Hest House and to prevent their removal by the Shaikh we could pay them ourselves. 6. I have thought before, when the Shaikh was con- tumacious on various occasions, of taking action under (b) above, but the payments are in connection with his providing certain air facilities, and so long as the Shaikh provided these facilities it was difficult to cut the subsidies on account of his political behaviour. Moreover the Air Ministry, who are the Department concerned, would not have agreed to any such proposal# -Now, however, the Shaikh by his attitude is deliberately endangering our air communications at Sharjah (see paragraph 3 above), and failing to fulfil his full responsibility for the protection of the staff and passengers /3 passengers of the company and their aircraft. i could not, of course, withhold payments on my own, hut would have to get ni a majesty‘a Government's sanction. visit to .Bahrain. x suggest you might call up the Residency Agent to -Bahrain hy air for my visit or part of it. he would he of assistance In our discussions on this, and 1 dare say other xrucial G'oast questions. I should also like to have the opportunity of saying farewell to him.

As the man is a coward it might have the desired result. If not I would telegraph to you and I fully agree that it would then be time to adopt item (b) of your paragraph 5* 6* Personally however I am fairly confident that we shall get the thing settled without an actual blow-up* I am pretty sure that Mana’s visit to Bahrain and his discussions here have had good results; and even if there are causes beyond my present knowledge making it impossible for Mana and party to settle in Abu Dhabi, I still might be able to make good use of Shaikh Shakhbut as a mediator when I am down on the Coast* Yours sincerely, d bPass to Political Resident, Persian Gulf, IMPORTANT, ,• / My letter c/374 of 7tn Ju. !.e, Dubai, Snell?b of Abu Dbabi has refused to allow Mans, and Co to reside in his State on ground that he is affaid of future complications between himself and Dubai.

ShaKhbut in response to request to assist negotiations for Mr a &amp; Co to go to Ras al Khaimah says that he has no influence with Sultan bin Salim. Residency Agent thinks that while latter would accept party less Mana and Beni Batti he will not agree to take the lot. 3. Residency Agent advises that we should now leave affairs tp take their own course. I would like, however, to try effect of communication to Sheikh of Sharjah as in para 5 of my letter quoted, and at same time to inform Mana that Sheikh Said's promise to return property will eKpire in one week (Said would unquestionably agree). This might result in dispersal of party which would have far less difficulty in finding refuge in other Stakes!f split up. 4. If not we should expect attack on Sharjah by Dubai.

Before giving this warning you should consult S.H.O. as to practicability of this measure ( see para 19 of Sharjah Defence Scheme 1939 copy of which was sent to 3. N.O. by A.O.C.). You should inform Sheikh of Sharjah (a) That by enciuraging the refugees he is inviting attack on Iris town which may endanger aerodrome.

As was reported in your letter No.566-3, dated the 20th April 1939 on the April disturbances in Dubai, some of the defeated ex-members of the Dubai executive Council were in refuge at Sharjah, but were expected to leave for a more distant Shaikhdon in view of the }.ure of restored property which had been offered to them. Pith true Coastal intransigence, however, they ignored advice to approach the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi or das al Khaimah and sought permission ro reside first in Ajman and secondly in Umm al Qaiwain, both of which towns are a short journey by motor from Dubai. 1 he *- ) haikhs concerned, suspicious of their motives and fearing that they themselves would oe involved in future complications with the Shaikh of Dubai, wisely refused to accept them. Shaikh kana, leader of the refugee oarty, and his companions then turned to -^as 04 Z, dated the 23rd2 *» al Khsiraah, and were again rejected • mainly, one may believe, because their previous approaches to the nearer Shaikhs had aroused even deeper suspicion of their future intentions. 3. These negotiations had been conducted in a dilatory manner, and meanwhile the Shaikh of Sharjah, a stupid, weak and ambitious man with a passion for inefficiently-conducted intrigue, had come to the conclusion that he might serve his own purposes by keeping the party at Sharjah. Shaikh Mana flew to Bahrain towards the end of May with the dual objects of enlisting ay support for their continued residence in Sharjah with their property restored to them, and of obtaining moral and financial aid frora the Shaikh of Bahrain. Within 48 hours the Shaikh of Dubai had also arrived, demanding 'permission 1 * to attack Sharjah on the ground that the r^fugee 3 , continued residence there meant that he was a virtual prisoner in his own State, compelled to maintain his own forces and his Bedu auxiliaries on a permanent war basis; he was forced to detain the ziiain body of the pearling fleet in Dubai; there had been esses cf arson in the town — one of which destroyed hundreds of palm huts; and the rotate of tension generally was intolerable. ’ ith Shaikh 3aid f s point of view it was impossible not to sympathise, but I extracted an undertaking from him to preserve peace for another fortnight until I myself visited the Trueiel Coast in company with the new Senior Naval Officer. Meanwhile I enlisted the aid of the Bair sin Shaikhs in an attempt to convince Shaikh Mana that he and his companions would only suffer themselves — and cause suffering to others —» by remaining in Sharjah. His Highness very kindly lent a launch in which Shaikh liana was sent to ou Dhabi to seek permission for uhe party to reside there; and I gave him a lette addressed to Shaikh Shakhbut which was designed to remove any misgivings the latter might have about the attitude of His Maj esty 1 s/3 Majesty’s Government If he accepted them, I confess I was greatly disappointed when the news arrived that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi also had refused permission to the party to reside in his territory* Cnee again nervousness,engendered by the previous conduct of Shaikh Mana and his companions, had proved the stumbling block* 4* The prospect of an attack by Dubai on Sharjah was now imminent* The final hope of evading hostilities seemed to lie in an attack on the Shaikh of Sharjah’s nerves, designed to induce him to expel the party from his State, whether or not they could find refuge elsewhere* To this end, on my arrival at Dubai in H*M*S* Shoreham, I demanded a further week’s delay from Shaikh Said before either attacking Sharjah or confiscating the refugees' property, and to this he agreed. I then proceed ed to Sharjah and summoned the Shaikh to the Fort* There the situation was put plainly and brutally to him — in effect that unless he rid himself of the Mana pert} he would be dead or himself a refugee from Sharjah in 8 days 7 he would receive no aid from His Majesty’s Government, who on the contrary intended to stop payments for the Sharjah air facilities which they could not longer safely use* A little bluster on his part quickly faded in the light of a reminder of the relative strength of Dubai in attack and Sharjah in defence (a reference to the Bedu and their passion for looting), and he left in a state close to panic* I followed up with a call at his fort, when I caused him to summon Shaikh Mana and the refugees* They also were left in no doubt of the prospects of the immediate future (including the final confiscation of their property in Dubai unless they left Sharjah within &amp; week) rind of the futility of expecting outside aid. They were told that their own conduct was responsible for the reluctance of other ;haikhs to receive them, and that, as I saw it, their only prospect of finding permanent refuge was to split and to approach some ©na Shaikh/Shaikh and some another. Since my statement was made to W whole party in the presence of the Shaikh of Sharjah, there now no room left for misunderstanding or later misrepresent ation* The meeting closed with an exhortation to the Shaikh to think of his own children and the children of his towns folk rather than of strangers who had already exhausted all claims on his hospitality* 5* I considered that the effect of this manoavre v/ould be enhanced by my immediate departure from Sharjah, and H*M*3* Shoreham procjeeded to Kalba and afterwards to Khor Quwai — 5 or 6 hours steaming from Sharjah* From time to time the screw was applied — e*g« the Hesidency Agent was instructed to issue ostentatiously a warning notice to Bz'itioh Indians after 4 days, — a warning to prepare for evacuation and to flr*erk their houses with a white cross (I had previously arrang ed with the Shaikh of Dubai that his Bedu should be made to respect such houses); a reminder of the passage of time was telegraphed; and the Residency Agent found other opportunities of adding to Shaikh Sultan bin 3aqr f s fears* 6* At intervals during the week hopes were raised that the Shaikhs of both Fas a! Khaimeh -nd *bu Dhabi would assist by taking some of the Mans party, only to be disappointed* 1 arrived back at Sharjah in B•!!• 3• Fowey the day before the period of grace was ctue to expire (we actually had a full a 48 hours, as the expiry day was/Friday), to find ohe Shaikh of Sharjah at last determined to rid himself of whe party* The Shaikh of Baa a! Khaimah hat premia ^ to take the whole party, but had gone to Dubai, ostensibly to settle minor details about housing with :~iv. fuld* . kiiew this meant that he would resile at the last moment, &lt;ad the shaikh of Sharjah therefore sent word that unless everything was settled by midday he would send Shaikh tana and the three other most dangerous members of the party to has &amp;X Khalmah, whether his cousin of ias si Khaimah liked it or not* letter/sm ; letter arriving from the latter that he had finally decided not to take theffi t the Shaikh of Sharjah put hia threat into execution at dnidnl^ht. Two other ine«\bera of the party were to follav almost at once, and the remaining tvro (the Awlad Than!) are to remain in Sharjah, with the concurrence of Shaikh Said# it i3 true that the Shaikh of las ®1 Khaimah v/ill do his best to return Shaikh Mana and his companions to Sliarjah, but it is highly improbable that he v ill succeed. Owing to fsuaily connections and their curious effects in the Jowasimi Shaikh- $ doms, the Shaikh of Sharjah has been able to send his own brother to las al Fhaimah with strict instructions to keep them there? and he states that one or other of his brothers will remain on this task so long as aiay be necsasary l It is known that the brother and nephews of the Shaikh of Has al Khalftah will be glad to have the Mana party there, an.l unless the Shaikh accents the position he may find himself dismissed — by no means an undesirable conclusion to the thole affair. That however remains to be seen. The essential fact is that the Awlad nashid and ths Awlad Eatti are out of Sharjah and, so far as one can reasonably 'oresee, will not be allowed tc return# The demeanour of Shaikh Sultan bin iaqr leaves me in no doubt that he is conscious of the removal of a gric-vouj burden which he will not viiiingly shoulder again# ShaikhrSaid of Dubai acknowledges that the Shaikh of Sharjah done all he could reasonably be expected to do, and he has on euggeation, sent a cordial letter of the aka to him# formal relation** and normsl traffic between the two towns were to recommence at one a, and a reconcil iation meeting between the two Shaikh® had oecn arranged before I left Sharjah, 7, I fully acknowledge that the permanent future residence of Shaikh Sfcina and his party has not been settled — end indeed may not be for some time# But the menace whicn they constitute to the peace of Dubai and the Trueis1 Coast in general has vastly diminished# The unanimous reluctance of the other Shaikh, to afford .them refuge, their ignominious expulsion from Sharjah, and the equivocal position they now occupy, m ^^ dar/6 render the® unattractive to the Bedu whom, so long as they remained in Sharjah, they might hope to attract to their cause, by promises of future regard. - As suggested above, considerable pressure is likely to be brought co boar on tnc Shaikh of Has al Khaimah to accept them formally as his 'rafi,is”, sir.; in this Shaikh Said of Dubai himself should be able to assist after his reconciliation with Sharjah* With their departure from Saarjah the lure of restored property is revived (Shaikh Sai- has agreed not co put his threat of confiscation into effect at once) and this .^y now prove a decisive contribution to a final solution, S.

Memorandum I beg to report that after you left for Bahrain on 24th June, I went to Dubai and suggested to the Shaikh to meet the Shaikh of Sharjah at Nahdah (half way between Sharjah and Dubai). The Shaikh agreed and sent a letter to the Shaikh of Sharjah inviting him for lunch on 25th and expressing his willingness to meet him at Nahadah. Both Shaikhs were suspicious of each other. In order to remove their misdoubts, I agreed to accompany the Shaikh of SharJall as far as Nahadah. At. 8 a.rn. on 25th I called on the Shaikh of SharJah,who was ready with about 30 of his notables and followers including the Shaikh of Hira,»Abdur Hahman bin Muhammad, and accompanied him to Nahadah. The Shaikh of Dubai arrived at ^ahadah about half an hour* before us. After the exchange of usual compliments, the Shaikh of Dubai took the Shaikh of Sharjah with him to Shandaqah and I returned to Sharjah. The meeting had very good affect on both Shaikhs. They had very friendly talks and expressed their desire to strengthen their friendly ties and co-operate with each other. Both Shaikhs also undertook to prevent people using their respective Shaikhs doms for hostile acts against either of them. They also promised to notify to the public that both Sharjah and Dubai would be considered as one.

He said to the Shaikh of Sharjah that if he was anxious about their stay at Has al Khaimah he should hold himself responsible for them to Shaikh Sa’id of Dubai. The Shaikh of Sharjah was disappointed with the Shaikh of Has al Khainah's reply.

At the request of Shaikh Mani' and with the help of Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr, Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad of the Albu Shamis agreed to accept the party, namely Mani' end others who wish to accompany him, as Rafiqs(subjects) and he wrote a letter to Shaikh Sa'id of Dubai to this effect. As Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad was afraid of Shaikh Sa'id lest he might instigate the Nu'aim against the Albu Shamis for keeping his enemies, he sent his brother Muhammad bin Hamad with the party to inform the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi of his action and see his reaction.* The party then left Buraimi for Sharjah via inbu Dhabi (a) to avoid trouble with the Bani Qitab and (b) to enable Shaikh Iluhammad bin Hamad of the Albu Shamis to acquaint Shaikh Shakhbut of their action and see if he had any objection. The Albu Shamis consider Shaikh Shakhbut as their protector with whom they are also in 'Ahad al 'nsabah (defensive and of ensive alliance).

The Shaikh fired a salute of three guns made horse racing and war dance in honour of the Albu Dhabi iDeople© Mani' called on me. They showed me a letter to Shaikh Sa'id (copy enclosed) and asked me if I would take it or send it to Shaikh Sa'id of Dubai.

There is nothing of importance to retort except that the Shaikh of Sharjah sent his motor car on 8th to Has al Khaimah with a letter to Shaikh Muhammad bin Salim brother of the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah requesting him to keep the members of Nani’ partyat Has al Khaimah. He also informed the owners of sailing boats not to bring them from Has al Khaimah should they try to do so without the Shaikh’s permission. Shaikh Rashid bin Mani*,however, got into the Si aikh of Sharjah’s car and came to Sharjah. After the return of the Shaikh’s car from Has al Khaimah, Shaikh Mani* came to me ? obviously being sent by 'trie shaikh of Sharjah, and said that the members of the party at K a s al Khaimah were in a very miserable state and tired of 'their life. They find it difficult to stay longer at Has al Khaimah where the Shaikh # does not want them. That as they have become Rafiqs of the Albu Shamis who are now responsible for them, it did not matter if they came to Sharjah from where they would go to Buraimi. He said from what he knows about them it would be difficult to control them and might return at their own accord either by sailing boat or other means. He asked me to assist them by giving permission for them to come. I said to Shaikh Mani* that the person concerned was the Shaikh of Sharjah and that it was for him to decide what he thought best in the interest of peace./Shaikh iiani’ was not satisfied with my reply and insisted that I should do my best and get them permission. I said that it was not for us to give permission and that inmmm my personal opinion it would be in their interest to remain where nhey are and from there go to Buraimi or other place which they choose to live in. shaikh Mani* argued that it was not possible for them ^o go from there and that they have to come to Sharjah in order to arrange about the removal of their families and properties-. He requested that I should write to you to give permission. 3. The Shaikh of Sharjah has no self will and whenever Mani 1 or |iis party requested him to do them anything he feels ashamed to refuse and refers them to me on the ..round that he acted on our instructions or advice. By doing so he shirks his responsibility and throws the whole burden on us. I do not think that he wants them now but he has not the moral courage to tell them frankly and firmly that they should not return camels to take their families but that he was anxious that the members now at has al Khaimah to come to Sharjah and arrange their own affairs. When things are fixed between the i Ibu Sham is and the Shaikh of Dubai about 'die party I do not think there would be much harm if they came to Sharjah,to arrange about their families, for two or three days provided the Shaikh of Dubai has no objection ana the matter is arranged between the Shaikh of Sharjah and Dubai without objection on our parto I should be grateful to have your orders on this point. 5.

When the party saw him they all got into the lorry and came to Sharjah without permission and against the instructions of Shaikh kuhammad bin Salim, orother oi the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah* ns soon as they arrived the Snaikh of Sharjah sent for them and politely tried to : ake them return at once. Shaikh Sa'id bin Bati was very rude. Shaikh Hazza* who was present scolaed Shaikh ^a'id bin Bati in the kajlis of the Shaikh. He said to Shaikh 0 a'id bin Bati 'Qadahik Tafih M (i.e. 'Youi' pot is over filled ') which mec.ns ' fou think too much of yourself ' • In order to 0 et the sympathy of others Shaikh Hazza' advised them to obey orders and listen uo advice. He said to Shaikh oa'id bin Bati what could he do if he was kicked out. The Shaikh of Sharjah was very much annoyed ana said that if they did not go back at once ne was going to give them 'Tisyar*(turned out as outlaws). They all returned to Has al Khaimah, save Llani' and Suhail, in the Shaikh's lorry ea.rj/ morning. 3 * Shaikh kuhammad bin Hamad brother of the Shaikh of the Alou Shamis and Shaikh Hazza' of Abu Dhabi left for Dubai in the morning on 10th July. The Shaikh of Sharjah went with his or others Shaikhs kuhammad and Hashid to see them off as far as Nahdah /NahdahChalf way) and then returned to Sharjah wioh his brother Rashid. Shaikh Liuliarmaad bin oaqr, accompanied them as far as Dubai and returned to Sharjah at noon. Shaikh Huzza 1 was met at Nahdah by Shaikh Rashid bin Sa’id, his cousins and notables in five motor cars. As soon as they crossed to Dubai side where the Shaikh of Dubai was waiting to receive them in his summer residence, a salute of three guns was fired and horse show was made in their honour. 4. Shaikh Huzza* told Shaikh Sa’id that he came from Abu Dhabi with Liani ’ party merely for projection and thau he had no other business whatsoever. He added that his brother Shaikh Shakhbut had instructed him to see Shaikh Sa’id and ask him if he could be of any service to him. That he should not leave Dubai without the Shaikh of Dubai’s permission. 5. No business was discussed by Shaikh kuhammad bin Hamad on 10th. On 11th he preseniafwo the Shaikh of uub^l L the letter (see paragraph 5 of my memorandum No. C/dt §*5-3/1 dvted the 8th July) which he brought with him from his orothen* Shaikh accepted the same but said to Muhammad bin Hamad that the letter did not specify besides the names of Shaikhs Mani* and Suhail and asked Muhammad bin Hamad if he would undertake responsibility for the rest. Shaikh Muhammad bin Hamad said that he was not sure about the members of the party who are at das al Khaimah. Shaikh Sa’id suggested that he should go to d a s al.Khaimah with Shaikh Mani' who should take HJiad (pledge) from the rtembers. who v/an'^ to become Rafiqs of the Albu Shamis, take ’.had from Shaikh Mani’ ana then return to Dubai ana give undertaking to Shaikh Sa'id. Hazza* who was present suggested that they should wake ’Abdullah bin Paris the Shaikh of Sharjah’s Secretary with them to conduct the ’Ahsd and act as witness. They intend to go to das a p Khaimah either tonight or tomorrow. 6. When Muhammad bin Hamad undertakes responsibilitym /Oh -3- for the party Shaikh Sa'id of Dubai has no objection if the members wish to come to Sharjah for few days to s.fn .i\ e about their families. Therefore I do not propose to say anything to the Shaikh of Sharjah if the Shaikh of Dubai of hks own accord or by arrangement with the nlbu Shamis or Sharjah allowes them to come. 7.

In order, however, to .get presents bedouins invent stories and convey them to the Shaikh as facts, bespite all the advice, the Shaikh is sometimes influenced by his brother Jum'ah and son kashid and induced to believe some of the false and conflicting ruir^ours circulated every day. For instance on 19th September I heard that the Shaikh oi - Dubai / mDubai received relaible information through a special messenger that Shaikh Mani ’ had collected a force of 400 bedouins and had left Hamasah to attack Dubai* I at once to Dubai and saw the Shaikh.

He told me that the messenger saw LianiV and the 400 men with his . ov.n eyes. He also showed me a small note which the messenger brought with him alleging that it was from one Abal T Abd who is a friend of the Shaikh. He also showed me a letter which he wrote and intended to send! then with a special messenger to the Albu Shamis. In this letter the Shaikh attacked the Alhu Shauis and accused them of breach of faith and. undertaking 1 for allowing Mani 1 to collect a force and attack Dubai without their informing him and turning them away from country. In addition to this he also intended to send a letter to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi informing him of the mischieifous act of the Albu Shamiso I said to the Shaikh of Dubai thaw I did not believe the story of the bedouin which I thought was one of the numerous false rumours floating every day® I strongly advised him not to send the letter to the Albu Shamis until he was sure of what-he was saying. The Shaikh agreed to my proposal and did not send the letters.

It is also stated that the Shaikh obtained access to a letter which had been sent from the tf Dubai plotters” to Mana. The whole thing looks to me like a product of nerves combinec . . with vindictiveness. The only odd points which may confirm the existence of a genuine plot are (i&gt; Shaikh Mujrin of the Murar arrived in Sharjah on October 12th and became a Aafiq of Shaikh Sultan; he may have got wind of something and wished to get clear(one of Ms sons is now ' wanted' by Shaikh Sa r id):(ii&gt; the day selected for the coup d* etat would hafee been tlie last- one beiOx e dojric'.dnan j (j_Uj.L.e a likely onej though ’Ohio is not 5 of course, a strong point* io, 4* Reactions are generally very unfavourable to Shaikh Sa’id for inflicting such a punishment;' but there is also a good deal of the ' plague o 1 both your houses.

Time after time I have exhorted Shaikh Sa^d, either personally or by messages sent through the Residency Agent, to ignore scares invented and the foolish actions advised by his cowardly buffoon of a brother Jum*a and his semi- maniac son Rashid$ but the Shaikh is incurably foolish and weak, and I fear that he is antagonising more and more people in Dubai. The prospects of the maintenance of peaceful conditions in Dubai indefinitely cannot be regarded as any thing but poor. If on your forthcoming passage by air through Dubai you have time to see Shaikh Sa’id it would, I think, be valuable if you would warn him once more against listening to unfounded rumours and indulging in acts of barbarism such as this which has now been reported* 3. If you have no time to do so I propose, subject to your approval, to instruct Captain Kowes to deliver a homily on my behalf to Shaikh Sa’ id. Political Agent, BahrainTranslation. The Event of Ramadhan Night Or Present-time Savagery. The n AL BAHRAIN T? newspaper has already published the news of the betrayal of Said bin Maktoom to his cousins, murder of Shaikh Hashur bin Rashid on 7th Safar 1358 and the loss of the lives of innocent persons who were killed at the Customs House at Dairah for no fault on their part except that they were employed by the Majlis people. Subsequently Shaikh Mani 1 and his followers left the town after a struggle which was admired even by his apponents.* They(Said etc) offered hundreds(of Rupees)to anyone who would kill Mani 1 but they failed in this unsuccessful attempt. On the day of the massacre, Khalifah bin Said attacked the Customs House at Dubai and arrested the following officials:- Rashid bin Butti, Mani f s nephew, Muhammad bin Abdullah bin baid ana Obaid bin Muhammad al Budoor. Khalifah bln Said has gallantly acted as he said to these persons, have been instructed to take you to prison and you need not be afraid.” When his brother Rashid blamed him for not killing them he said that it was not fair to kill unarmed persons who did not even object to his arresting them. Rashid, however, did not give up this idea and decided either to kill them or put out their eyes by branding them with red iron but Sayid Abdur Razzaq, on hearing of this intention, caused their release at once and prevented Said from taking such a wild action. Later Shaikh Said tried to give the people assurances and asked those who had fled away to return to their country and gave them papers bearing his name on top and his seal and the signature of his son Rashid at the bottom. A specimnen is shown below:- From - Said bin Maktum al Hashur. To - Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Said. I hereby give you and your brothers assurance of safety over your life and property as far as myself, all my sons and brothers are concerned. You need not be afraid.2 Dated, 15th Safar 1358. Seal - Said bln Maktum al Hashur Shaikh Rashid bin ^aid. Days passed and Manx* proceeded to Oman. Said used to receive every now and then warnings that Mani 1 was preparing to attack him with a large number of men. Whenever a shout came from outside, they used to direct accusations against the inhabitants. Two months ago they expelled Ali bin Said bin ’Atiq with a number of others on the charge that he was attempting to assasinate Said. On 1st Sha»ban Muhammad and Ahmad sons of Said bin tAllan, Chiefs of al Bumhair were deported with a large number of others. Rashid wanted to put out their eyes but his brother IQialifah prevented him from doing so. On 27th Sha*ban Shaikh Muqrin, Chief of Murriyin, moved to Sharjah with his sons and followers.On Ramadhan night the great calamity befell us. After sunset prayer a message was sent to the people at their houses to the effect that Rashid wanted to see them and talk to them on a certain subject. Some of them fell suspicious over this call and ran away while five of them responded to the call thinking that Rashid was going to ask them to get ready for any emergency as he had done on on one occasion 2 days ago. They proceeded to him thinking of no ill intent against them as they had not committed any crime. They are Muhammad bin Jumah Balkaizi, his two sons, Jumah and Ahmad, Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Said and Oabid bin Muhammad al Bidoor, cousin of the person who was killed on 7th Safar. No sooner these young men took their seats than Rashid came and asked them to admit that they had purchased arms for Mani f and sent letters to him and to let him know who were their accomplices. They denied^all these charges and asked him to prove them by evidence. He, however, insisted on holding them guilty(his uncle Jumah bin Maktum assisted him in this crime)and ordered that they should be removed to prison. Later he visited them in the prison andagain made enquiries froia them but they adhered to what they had previously said and asked him to keep them in prison until such time as he could obtain evidence against them and then inflict on them whatever punishment he desired but he disapproved of this suggestion. By his orders fire was set to blaze on which iron nails were placed until they became red-hot. Then several men sat on the breast of those persons one by one and another man came and thrust the iron nail in the their eyes very severely. With this they were•not even satisfied. They began testing their eyesight by aoplying torch light to them and asking them whether they could see or not. Then they left them alone in their fetters. Next morning they released them from prison and asked them to go to their houses without any guide and without being carried by some means. They entered the market blindly and in a highly lamentable condition. By doing so they intended to give a lesson to the people but, on the contrary, their action was received with much indignation. 0* God, witness this gross oppression. Verily your Lord is not unaware of what the oppressors do. We heard that Ehalifah bin Bal'd resented the act of his brother and uncle and said that had he known about it he would have prevented them from doing it. Now come and mend what you have torn. Where are the Arabs on whom you depend in emergencies? As a result of this incident all of them had gone away with your arms. Later Rashid and Jumah collected the Arabs whom he heard were going to leave the town and gave them assurances of safety. Jumah said that they did not punish anyone without evidence and Shara' decision. Ahmad bin Hasan al Qadhi said to him, «We ask you by God whether you punished those persons on evidence and Shara' decision ? 11 He replied, n Yes, Ibn Sahim (a man from Hazimah)informed us that an agreement wa.s concluded against us with Mani 1 • He said, t7 This cannot serve as evidence.'4 Said is being overruled by his son and wife and exercies no more power as if he is nothing at all. He changed his Arab Guard to that of Baluchi Guard. As regard.s Mani» and his followers, one day will come when they will enter the town and everyone will turn against Said even his own party, women and children. Meanwhile the people are picking up nev/s of Mani* every now and then and following his movements. They are awaiting very anxiously his attack, even Rashid 1 s guards and cousins.

Note: ; Most probably the above signature is an anonymous one. Sd. Khalid al FahadThe Cruel actions of the Rulers of Dubai. On the night of 1st Ramadhan five innocent persons of the best people of Dubii were arrested while reading the Koran in the Mosque after the Asha prayer. Their hands were tied to their backs and were taken to the Fort where they were put in iron fetters. They did not know what was going no to happen to them and there was/reason for this sudden action. Then fire was set on which iron nails were placed. When those innocent and wretched persons saw this, |hey cried for help but nobody took any notice of them, later the servants came forward-threw them on the ground and sat on their breasts and started thrusting those red-hot iron nails into their eyes Later they disfigured their faces and put earth in their eyes. What a brutality and horror1 They are Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Said, ex-Cashier, Obaid bin Muhammad al Budoor, deputy Rais Baladiyah , Muhammad bin Jumah Balqaizi, merchant, aged 70 years and his two sons Jumah and Ahmad. One of them paid a ransom of iis.700 for one of his eyes to Rashid bin Said bin Maktum. This happened at about 7 o T clock (Arabic) at night. At 3 0 T clock in the morning they took them out and showed them round the bazaars. All the town was horrified and the people became afraid, as a result of which most of them took refuge in the neighbouring countries such as Sharjah leaving behind their families and children. When they noticed the emmigration of the people, they called for the others and gave them assurances that there will be no recurrence of such acts &lt; except after investigation and proof but the people did not rest assured and said that these promises are like the promise; of Hitler to the world. On several occasions they gave promises to the inhabitants that they would not commit any acts suCwh as burning houses, looting properties and killing children but they did not keep to their promises. Is there someone who will rescue this country which is boiling as a pot on fire and is it out of humanity to help such a Ruler?These wretched persons were treated in this manner for no fault on their part except that they alleged that certain self-interested persons reported to the Ruler Said bin ^aktoom that those persons were saying that Mani’ was coming to Dubai. This was untrue. What cruel and savage people they arel One will really become perplexed at the savagery of these people who neither fear God nor feel ashamed from the public. O 1 let the history write down and the earth be a witness. No power except with God* the Great and Mighty. EYE WITNESS.

According to Howes, who does not quote source of information or reasons for his belief, an attack on Dubai by Bedouin led by Shaikh Liana may be expected 'fairly shortly' though not before end of Ramazan. 3. 1 am calling for fuller information. If this is confirmatory we can either (a) let things take their own course and merely warn Imperial Airv/ays to be prepared to use Ras al Fhaimah; or (b) if Royal Air Force can co-operate we might warn Mana that we will not tolerate in war time hostilities involving interruption of air route and that any Bedouin attacking Dubai will themselves be attacked by aircraft with bombs and machine guns. 4 . I suggest course (b) in present circumstances. - Political -Telegram U.T.C. From Political Agent, Bahrain. To Besidency Agent, Sharjah No. 243 Dated 6 th November 1939 Captain Hov/es reports that attack on Dubai by Shaikh Liana and Bedouin is likely soon after Bamadhan. 2 . As Howes is apparently at Has al Lhaimah you should report at once by air mail: (i) what are sources of information and are they usually reliable; (ii) is feeling in Dubai now so violent against Shaikh Said that he cannot withstand attack by Bedouin in spite of his strong new forts; (iii) who is supporting Liana; (iv) who is providing funds to pay the Bedouin. 3. I presume Lana would not attack unless certain of quick success. 4. Give copy of this telegram and your reply to Captain Howes. Political - f SI wmConfidential D.O.No* C/715-22/8 Dated the 7th November 1939. will you please refer to your derai-official letter No. 2 dated the 4th NovaT.ber 1939 in which you suggest that ©n attack on Dubai by Bedouin led by Shaikh Mana can be expected fairly shortly ? 2. when reporting the likelihood of an event of such far- reaching importance will you please discuss the sources of information and the degree of reliance to be placed in them ? Previous reports from the Trucial Coast had given the impression that the fear of an attack on Dubai by Bedouin under Shaikh Mana was the product of the over-heated Imagination of Juma and Rashid, that Shaikh Said was in full control in Dubai and that the new defences were very strong indeed. It is true that there has been uneasiness in Dubai and apparently several notables have left. Nevertheless the leader of the As-Sudan was reported to have returned and even if Shaikh Mtijrin had refused to come back from Sharjah he was, after all, no great loss. If therefore there is a definite danger now of an attack in the near future it must mean that Shaikh Said’s position in/- Ln J, B. Howes, I. A., Political Officer, Trucial Coast*- 2 ~ // in his own town has deteriorated very rapidly, and that the Bedouin whom Shaikh Kana is collecting or has collected are satisfied that they will have a walk over. 1 3. On receipt of your letter I telegraphed to the Residency Agent for fuller infomation (since you are in Has al Khaimah) and have told him to give copies of my telegram and of his reply to you when you return. 4. I am not at all sure that in war time we can allow an attack on Dubai, involving interruption of the ©ir route — provided of course that we can stop it. This depends on the abilltv of the Royal Air Force to send down aircraft, and I am in communication with the Political Resident on the subject* If we decide to stop it, it will mean sending a message out to Mana warning him that he and his Bedouin will be attacked with bombs and machine guns from the air if they advance on Dubai; and as a corollary we shall have to Insist on Shaikh bald doing something very effective to keep Rashid and Juma under jsontrol. 5. If on the other hand we decide that we have to let matters take their own course then your action would be to warn both parties in the usual way to avoid doing damage to the lives and properties of British subjects, to shift the dispensary staff, and advise British subjects to leave Dubai temporarily. Pe should also have to instruct Imperial Airways to abandon the Dubai creek temporarily. And while on/- /■sy -3- C V V V J 6 1 &gt; V on this point, if the new moorings for Has al Khaimah have arrived they might now be laid, ostensibly on behalf of the hoyal Air Force* I should prefer a verbal message ' V to be given to the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah on this matter.

On the 6 th November I received a report from the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, written two days earlier, in which he stated that fl it seems that an attack on Dubai by Bedouin led by Shaikh Mana may have to be expected fairly shortly.** He thought that it would not happen during Kamadhan, but asked for instructions as to the course of action he should adopt in case of trouble. 3. In response to a call for fuller information the Residency Agent has now reported (in the absence of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, on tour at Has al Khaimah) that certain of the Dubai refugees had assembled a short while ago at a place called Muzairi not far from Sharjah in Beni Kitab country. They had a small force with them and were later on joined by Shaikh Mana with 25 men and Said bin Bati with 8 more. Some of them entered Sharjah in disguise and there were indications that the Shaikh of Sharjah intended to help the Mana party with money and arms because he had ground for complaint against Shaikh Said of Dubai. Meanwhile however Shaikh Juma and Shaikh Rashid, brother and son of the Shaikh of Dubai, had realised/-- 2 - realised the appalling error they had made in causing five men to be blinded and had retired into the background. Shaikh Said still has considerable personal popularity in Dubai and has been re-establishing alliances with Umm al Oaiwain 9 Ajman and the Shaikh of the Beni Kitab, A better feeling exists in Dubai town itself, and there seems now to be some likelihood that Shaikh Said will be in a position soon after the Id to despatch a force to attack Shaikh Mana 1 s adherents who have retired to a point about 20 miles from Sharjah in Beni Kitab country but who appear likely to lose all Beni Kitab support. Shaikh Said is enlisting Baldchis for certain defensive posts around Dubai and the Sudan and various other sections in Dubai town (in which I include Daira) appear to be rallying to his cause. 4. Nevertheless intrigue, apparently based very much on Sharjah, is rampant and any further barbarities in Dubai such as the recent blindings might bring things to a head at any moment and lose finally for Shaikh Said the support of his townsfolk. It is, in my opinion, in the highest degree import ant that Shaikh Said should be exhorted to suppress his brother Jumah and his son Rashid and to maintain constant consultation with his Majlis. Provided that there are no major developments in the next seven days I propose, unless instructed to the contrary by you, to send a lengthy message on these lines to Shaikh Said through Captain Howes. / Political Agent, Bahrain1 22 yV. \ Coniidenti&amp;l. rtjN, '2 MOV.

I based my assessment of the situation on the fact of the reinforcement of the refugee party et Muzairi’ by man a’ and Suhail, and on the dissatisfaction of numerous people with Sheikh Sa’id’s barbarous treatment of the five 'plotters”. I think it was a reasonable deduction from these two facts, to argue that Mans’ was intending to turn the popular feeling to his own account. There was also the surreptious appeernace of some of the Al Bu Falasah exiles in Sharjah, ana a rather suggestive 'feeler' put cut to me in the course of con versation by Abdullah bin Pars. (A propos of the Sharjah participation Sheikh Sultan has sent me an assurance that he has 'no such ideas' , which may perhsps have some value to bludgeon him with, if he goes too far.) 1 £m trying not to base any reports on local information, fts 1 think the ’degree of reliance is altogethertoo unknown a quantity..BP viv 5 .

However, as you will hawe seen from the F.A.'a memorandum rtferred to, the position is now very much improved. The refugees have moved away from the vicinity of Deb;i, and only the desert law is now making Sheikh Mohamed bin Ali f orbid Sheikh Sa’id to attack them in his territory for a period of four days: while, as far rs public opinion goes. Sheikh Sa’id has at least done penance to it by his conciliatory visits to Ajman and Umm al Qatwain. 7* i shall be glad, however, to hear in due course what the Resident’s decision about our policy is; as the situation may alway blow up again at short notice;From To Telegram T, Q” ■''is Political Resident* Political Agent, Bahrain No. T/472.

The Political Resident has agreed that this should be done. Will you therefore arrange formally to meet Shaikh Said, informing him that you have a personal message for him from me ? The message should be given verbally or the following lines. 3 . ”1 have been much disturbed to hear of the state of unrest which has existed recently in Dubai* Deports reaching me h-ve made it clear that Shaikh laid has ignored previous messages delivered through the Residency Agent advising him not to listen to foolish and unsun orted rumours carried to him by Shaikh &lt;Tuma and Shaikh Rashid, and I was horrified recently to hear that he had come so much under their influence that he had permitted them to blind five men in Dubai. He himself knows well enough how flimsy the evidence was on which accusations were raised against these five men and T need net say more on that ooint; but I trust that he realises very plainly that this barbar ous action has aroused feelings of the utmost disgust not only in the Political Resident and myself, but also in every 2 Nov/ that the scare of hostilities in Dubai itself Captain J«B.Howes, person/* Political Officer, Trucial Coast.- 2 - person from Kuwait to Muscat who has heard of it. For myself, I hope that I shall not meet either Shaikh Juma or Shaikh Rashid for many months to come, as I do not relish shaking hands with men who have been responsible for such a crime against humanity. ' I am relieved to hear that Shaikh Said now apparently realises how very greatly cruel acts of this sort damage his own position. We are not living in an age when brute force and tyranny are sufficient to keen people under subjection; in these days the people think for themselves and they will not tolerate savage acts of despotism. Time after time I have reminded Shaikh Said that he can only be strong in Dubai so long as he can rely on the solid support of the people of his State. Under the influence of Shaikh Jurna and Shaikh Rashid he has apparently forgotten or ignored this advice, with the result that he has antagonised more and more of those who once supported him. It is not however too late yet to regain his old position. But in order to do so he must rely on the aid and advice of the members of his /dvisory kajlis, who apparently have been totally ignored for months past. If he will only take then into his confidence, and make it quite evident that his object is to rule his State for the benefit of his people, he will undoubtedly regain their support and with it the support of the whole population. But above all I advise him most strongly, in his own interests, to avoid listening to the unconfirmed ’’scare-stories’* of his brother and to keep his eldest son under control .’ 1 4, Incidentally, I shall be interested to know why Shaikh Said will not hand over the Aw*lad Than! property.

It is probably a more satis- Ih ctory solution to the Aui ad Thani themselves, as there is a good chance of securing their return to Debai later on, than to have their property sold on a very unfavourable market, in order to be handed over to them now. —• * k Political Officer, Trueial coast.Confidential No. C/787-22/8.

It oula be a dangerous precedent to restore property to people who have caused harm to the state. I request that the matter be dropped. 3* I propose now to reply in these terms:- ' My object in urging Shaikh Sa 1 id to restore at least the income of the Auwlad Thani property was simply to effect better relations between him and his neighbour, Sharjah, who is considerably.p.- \ willingness ?- v... ^l.e Aiivvlctd -li&amp;ni i*»o nesicie in Slispja.li* Sucli intransigeince on the part of Shaikh Sa l id can only cause him to forfeit still further the good opinion of the Honourbale the Political Resident '* I do not think any further efforts to get the property restored will have any effect; but should be glad of your advice on the point* 4o When the Honourable the P I gathered that his attitude was di of Shaikh Sa ! id.

G’ir Kingsley Wood, who is grateful for the exhaustive review made hy the Political Resident, has given careful ifonsideration to the determination of suitable alternatives to Dabai and Sharjah in consultation with Imperial Airwayse_ He shares the Company’s view that from an operational point of view, a combined marine and land airport at Ras-el-Khaimah would be the best alternative, and in normal circumstances he would suggest that the Political Resident should negotiate with the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah to enable the desired facilities to be provided. In view, however, of the War and the need for rigid economy, Sir Kingsley Wood now feels that the expenditure on providing the necessary ground organisation^ and on obtaining the necessary permission from the Sheikh would not be justified, especially as the Empire services are now reduced in number and are not under the same obligation as previously to adhere to a strict schedule. Imperial Airways have, therefore, agreed with his suggestion that until such time as it is possible to provide a combined airport at Ras—el- Khaimah, Kalba -should be regarded as the alternative land aerodrome to Sharjah, and Ras—el-Khaimah as the alternative alighting area to Dabai, with their existing^facilities* Imperial Airways have, however, stated that it would oe ot if permission could be granted to them to the period of an emergency, the control equipped with wireless) from Dabai to Ras-el- that such procedure would not involve / negotiating a fresh agreement with the Sheikh.

You will see that while the Admiralty were prepared to agree on certain conditions, that the proposed discretion should be given, the Foreign Office share the reluctance of the Air Ministry and of ourselves to agree to the delegation of so / wide a discretion. As the Foreign Office point out, the Resident like, other superior officials far from their home Government must necessarily have a certain residuai’y discretion to act on his own responsiDility if a crisis were so grave and imminent that he could await orders* His Majesty’s Government are responsible for defending the Resident’s actions before Parliament and public opinion; and, therefore, although, we are quite prepared to agree tnat in the circumstances contemplated immediate punitive meaoures against a recalcitrant Sheikh might well be necessary in certain cases, it is obviously desirable that, where the situation/ Hon’ble Lt .Col.C.G.Prior, C.I.E.

Leaving aside the question of the precise relationship between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Sheikhdoms ? and taking* at the same time* full c^ccoun' of the policy of His Majesty’s Government to interfere as little as possible in the internal affairs and administ.ration of the Sheikhdoms ? it is nevertheless probably true to say that their relations with the Sheikhdoms are of such a kind as to place upon His Majesty’s Government the ultimate responsibility for the maintenance of order and good government in the territories concerned. At any rate His Majesty’s Government are responsible for order and good government where the interests of third powers are c oncer nab., I know that juridically speaking the Trucial Sheikhdoms are not in the position of Indian States* but what I have in mind is something akin to the admitted right of the Paramount Power to interfere in the internal affairs of the Indian States when their administration fails to produce a certain minimum level of good government or acts in a manner seriously prejudicial to the interests of the Paramouni Power. 4. To carry the argument a step forward* it seems oo us that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is jn some respects at any rate in the position of an Indian or Colonial Governor or High Commissioner. In normal cases a Governor or High Commissioner refers* I presume* to some higher authority (it may be His Majesty’s Government or /:d may be the Government of India) before taking drastic cac -mon* On the other hand* there must be times when any delay^would be dangerous; he has to act on his own responsioility arc the fact that he may so have to act is accepted and recognised. The Political Resident is* we suggest* in^wo same position and must be deemed to possess discretion m the last resort to take whatever steps he may tuirm. ^ necessary to secure the vital interests of His Majesi/y j G overnment in the States (with the possible excepoion Muscat) for which he is responsible. If he can reier ^ - before taking these steps he ought to do so* dug il r) ^ Jj ° must act on his own responsibility. 5. But the degree of urgency cannot/oe laid, cov/n in advance and if the Political Resident finds i^ receoo^ry to act in an emergency without reference to His Lmjes Government, all that can be said is that IIis Majesoy ^ Government will examine as sympathetically as possioie o explanations which he subsequently gives for ms *This, it seems to me, would apply to urgent action needed to secure the safety of Royal Air Force machines passing through the Trudial Sheikhdoms as well as to all other matters * 6 . But it is quite a different thing to say that the Political Resident may have authority to act without reference home for one specific purpose and not for others* If the line of reasoning set out above is correct, he has this authority anyhow, subject to subsequent justification of the urgency of the peril, but if there is time to refer home there is no reason why he should not do so in connexion with the defence of Royal Air Force machines any more than in connexion with any other question. 7. The question also arises how far the local naval and air commanders could or should take action at the request of the Political Resident, and in the absence of specific instructions. But I suppose the same problem arises elsewhere, and they, too, presumably have a residuary discretion to act on their own responsibility in an emergency. 8 . We do not feel that this is a question which closely concerns the Foreign Office, since it does not seem likely that the interests of any third power would be involved,and it is the India Office who are responsible for the administration of the Arab coast of the Gulf. But J. thought that it would be as well to let you know fairly fully how we look at the problem. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Lacy Baggallay5323/39. ,828/39. Admiralty, S.W.1. 30th August, 1939. CQNFIDSNTIiiX iiND lilM^DIATH}. Sir, With reference to India Office printed letter No.P.2.4142/39 dated July 21st, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to offer, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India, the following observations on paragraph 4 of the Political Resident's Express Letter No,0/240 of June 28th* My Lords entirely agree that the direction requested should be granted on the undertaking (a) that it is limited, as suggested by the Resident, to those cases in which local trouble coincides with a major crisis; (b) That all possible precautions should be taken to ensure that bombardment would only cause damage to the forces, forts or personal establishments of the Sheikh concerned, and that danger to innocent civilian life would be avoided. In this connection My Lords assume that the Resident would be guided by the advice of the Senior Naval Officer as to the practicability of the various possible objections having the foregoing considerations in mind; (c) that the Resident should report home immediately when he is making, or about to make, requests for bombing or bombardment to be carried out. My Lords also observe that in paragraph 6 of his letter the Resident suggests that Khor Kuwai could be used as an alternative alighting place for sea-craft. in view of the importance of this base to the Navy, My Lords are anxious to be kept informed of any action taken on this suggestion. In particular, if there is any chance of the Sultan of Muscat becoming ''apprehensive of any further requests xor facilities there, it is suggested that the matter shouxci ue put to him very tentatively and should not oe pressea ix oy so doing there would be any likelihood of his withdi^avi^g ^ the facilities he has already granted for the Navy. Iu 13 true that H.M. Ships may in war have to use his porusana waters whatever his attitude may be, but it is conveni^n also to have at IChor Kuwai in peace certain facilities wmen could be quickly expanded in time of war,^and My Loras _ consider that it is most desirable to avoid any ac Lion vnici might result in the Sultan withdrawing them.

I Dear Jarrett ? Would you please refer to the Express Letter Ifto.C.240 of 28th June 1939, from the political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of the Debai-Sharjah crisis, and also to his subsequent telegram dated 19th August, (copies of which were forwarded to you under cover of India Office letters No.P.Z.4142/39 and p.Z. 4857/39 of 21st July and 21st August.) For the most part the questions dealt with by the Political Resident in his letter are matters for the Air Ministry who are examining them in consultation with Imperial Airways, but in paragraph 4 he made one suggestion which is of more general concern. This suggestion is that the Political Resident should be given discretion in any future similar emergency to request the Air Officer Commanding and the Senior Naval Officer to use punitive measures against any Sheikh whose action is imperilling the safety of the aerodromes. We should be glad to have your comments on this suggestion, to which we are inclined to see considerable objection, at any rate in ordinary times of peace. v?e have not yet received the views of the Air Ministry officially on this point but I understand that they are likely to share our view. I am sending a copy of this letter to Eyres. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. Peel. C.G. Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty, S.W.l.Confidential . No. C/48-22/8.

The position regarding the use of punitive measures on this coast is as follows. My predecessor approached the Secretary of State on the 28th June 1939 asking, inter alia , for permission to use punitive measures at Sharjah and Debai at his discretion as circumstances dictated i4. He received a reply that matters were under discussion, but that they doubted whether His Majesty s Government would be prepared to grant the proposed dis- cretion in peace-time. Further reminders have elicited no reply, but I am now trying again. 3. My own views are that since we have hitherto obtained our objectives, (and at the outset under far more difficult circumstances), without firing a shot, we should be wrong to use force now, since it would certainly be misrepresented and might well have results very different from those we anticipate. X would much prefer to divert the air services during the hostilities, which are usually of short duration, but since unforeseen circumstances may compel us to use force it will be useful to have the discretion asked for and that is why I have reminded the Secretary of State.

Shaikh Man!' has again moved to Khawanij, and is reported to be collecting forces. I let him know, through his agent in Sharjah, Rashid bin Buti bin Rashid, that Shaikh 3a*id had expressed readiness to give him an allow ance if he would live in Bahrain or India, and that I was even now ready to go out to hear any proposals that he might wish to make. I was, however, told that an allow ance was completely unacceptable, and that Mani' would only be content with a full restoration to Dubai. As Sa’id will never consider this, any negotiation between the par ties is out of the question. Rashid bin Buti told me that Fani' had 200 men and would have 350 in a few more days. Maktum bin Rashid told the R.A. that he had 500. As against this, I asked ’Isa bin Thani, who had just returned from Khawanij, what they had killed for the ’Id. His reply was ’’three goats”, which is meagre fare for numbers such as these '. The defenders seem to be in a high state o^ pre paredness, esoecially at night. None of my numerous callers on the occasion of the ’Id expressed any desire for Mani's return, though T did not, of course, press for opinions.

Movements s- I have been obliged to postpone my tour to Baraimi by the recrudescence of trouble in Dubai. 2. Dubai On the night of Jan.23rd/24th, Sh. Rashid bin Said moved out to a place about three miles out of Daira with a for&amp;e estimated at 150 men. On Jan. 25th a party of 50 of Sh. Manias suppor ters, who apparently had no information of this move, ran against Sh. Rashid whem they were engaged in a reconnaissance or raiding patrol. They were driven back to Khawanij, losing three men wounded; none of these were, however, of their leaders. The Dubai Shaikhs then made further efforts j;j to get Mohamad bin Ali to detach the Beni Kitab supporters from Mani in order, by their account, to give them a free hand to attack Mani without involving themselves in hostilities with the Beni Kitab. The Beni Kitab, however, saw too much advantage to themselves in the present state of affairs, and continued to play the double game that has characterised their dealings with both parties. There was some talk among the Dubai leaders of using their forces to attack Sharjah, and thereby cut Mani of! from the source from which he has been continuously deriving support. A feeling of nervousness was also apparent in Sharjah, and during the night of Jan. 27th/28th a fusillade of shots was fired at a couple of innocent fishing boats entering the creek, on the suspicion that they contained the forces of Sh. Humaid bin Abdullah in an attack on Sharjah. On Jan. 31st Sh. Mani arrived at my house in Sharjah, and asked me to use my good offices to secure a settlement. Sh. Said declined to negotiate by direct conversation with Mani, but re-affirmed his readiness to provide allowances, to include the Aulad But! as well as the Aulad Rashid, but not the Aulad Than! or the Aulad Huraiz, an essential condition being that they should leave Oman territory.

I am a-;ed about 65 years. I am a pearl merchant by profession and own a lar^e property at Dubai. About 6 months ago one Shaikh Mani bin Rashid who is a cousin of Shaikh Said bin Makto n, a rullin chieftain of Dubai, requested the latter tc^introduce certain social reforms in Dubai for the uplift fef Araos, such as school dis ensaries etc.but he refused.Hence the former Shaikh Mani revolted against Shaikh Said and took up arms against him. The revolt ended with the escape of Sha kh Mani. I, being a leading man of Dubai whs called by Shaikh Said who asked me to show the reasons why 1 had taken part in the activities of Shaikh Mani against him. I asked him to prove ray guilt but he refused. On the 1st of Ramzan, i.e.loth October 193^, Shaikh Said called me along with four other Arabs, ordered his men tc^tie our hands and feet and punctured our eyes with red hot poker. We arranged to escape secretly and got on board the ship the S.S. Bankura, so that we should get rid of the atrocities being corn** mi tied by Shaikh Said. I along with the other four Arabs who are related to me, arrived in Bombay on the 14th November 1939. Soon after my arrival I and the other four Arabs were admitted to Banaji’s Hye Hospital, at Navsari Building, Hornby Road, Bombay. I do not know a iything about the facts that Shaikh Said bin Maktoom disapproves the landing of British seaplanes in Dubai waters. 1 know so much that British aeroplanes are laud ing in Dubai without any hitch or interference of the Arabs or the Shaikhs of Dubai..

It may aid the appreciation of the present situation if I summarise briefly the events which have occurred since XV ' SO my report No. C/386 dated the 26th tTune 1939 on uhe settlement then made between the Shaikh of Dubai on the one hand and Shaikh Mana and his party and the Shaikh of Sharjah on tne other. After protracted discussion and negotiation shaikh Malta and five of his principal supporters were accepted as rsfiqs in September 193S by the Al Bn Shaiais Shaikh of Hamasa, and oheu movable property was returned to them. A few supporters, including in particular the Aulad Thani family, remained in Sharjah by agreeme? with the Shaikh of Dubai, but the Aulad Thani»s property was not returned to them. The Shaikh of Dubai*s final refusal to return their property on the ground that they were intriguing against hii deeply offended the Shaikh of Sharjah and became a point of considerable significance later. Shaikh Mana and those of his supporters /- -l&amp;WMqtuze} S. 14. MFP—367 S&amp;P—(M-508)—15-7-35—10,0C0. V Sucss jEmsupporters who went with him to Hamasa were extremely restless, and indeed a hinterland village like Hamasa was a most inappropriate place for them to live in. Constant intrigue followed, the Shaikh of Dubai lived in permanent fear of assassination, and in October 1939 he connived at the brutal blinding of five Dubai residents by his brother Shaikh Juma and his son Shaikh lashid. As a result he lost, temporarily at any rate, almost all support in his own town and there was a considerable exodus of Dubai residents. Shaikh Mana and many of his adherents collected at a place called Muzairi, not far from Sharjah in Beni Kitab country, where they were joined by a small contingent from one of the sub-sections of the Beni Kitab tribe. Later however Shaikh Said of Dubai succeeded in rallying the support of most of the inhabi tants of Dubai and brought pressure to bear on the Beni Kitab Shaikh to turn Mana and his party out of Beni Kitab country. Shaikh Mana paid frequent visits to Sharjah where he first solicited ©id from His Majesty* s Government through Captain Howes and afterwards sought Captain Howes 1 good offices in arranging a settlement with Shaikh Said. Meanwhile his supporters moved to Khawaniq about 15 to 20 miles from Dubai town in Dubai territory. They still had with them a few Beni Kitab supporters and on the 26th January 1940 a party of about 50 men led by Mana* s son carried out a reconnaissance patrol in the direction of Daira and came into contact with the Dubai lorces, losing three men wounded. At this stage the Beni Kitab &gt;haikh, apparently under pressure from Abu Dhabi, wi thdrsw all liana’s Beni Kitab supporters, and an admirable opportunity occurred for Dubai to wipe out the Mana party, ^he opportunity /•- 3 - opportunity was not however taken. Finally at the begin ning of February Shaikh Maaa again asked Captain Howes to negotiate a peasteful settlement. Shaikh Said undertook to grant allowances to the Aulad Rashid and Aulad Bati subject to their leaving Trucial Oman for good but a few days later Shaikh Mana put forward absurd counter-proposals demanding the return of the whole of their property, allowances for all of them and permission to live wherever they chose. Naturally Shaikh Said refused even to consider such proposals. 3. After various postponements due to the dislocation of the air service, I arrived in Sharjah on the 17th Feb ruary. I found that by then the whole of Shaikh Mana* s party, with one or two exceptions, had collected in Sharjah and that, including servants and followers, they mustered roughly 100 men. I at once saw Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah and advised him to remove them once more from his town. Shaikh Sultan however, who had been bitterly offended by the Shaikh of Dubai* s refusal to hand over to him the property of the Aulad Thani, declined to do so on the usual ground that it was against Arab custom to turn out people who sought refuge with him. No argument could prevail and it was apparent that he had reverted to the belief that he would be able to bring about Shaikh Said* s V downfall and the elevation of Shaikh Mana to power in Dubai. As I have reported on previous occasions he is a man of unbelievable stupidity with megalomaniac tendencies. Shaikh Mana applied for an interview with me which I refused, since it was apparent that I should not be able to induce him to agree to any terms providing for a per manent peaceful settlement and 1 wished to ;?ive no opportunity /-- 4 - opportunity for intensifying his propaganda that sooner or later he would be supported by His Majesty’s Government against Shaikh Said# I then saw Shaikh Said at Dubai. He stated firmly and definitely that he did not intend to allow the present position to continue and that he was about to attack Sharjah unless matters were arranged to his satisfaction by other means. He had had meetings with the Shaikhs of Umm al Qawain, Ajman and Has al Khaimah, but had no expectation that these Shaikhs would be able to arrange matters. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had sent representatives to ascertain the exact position in Dubai* and to enquire what Shaikh Said’s terns were, but again there was little prospect of Shaikh Shakhbut doing anything effective. He had however served Dubai interests by causing the withdrawal of all Beni Kitab support from Shaikh Man a and in spite of old ties of friendship with Sharjah he would not now, in Shaikh Said’s opinion, support Sharjah against Dubai# ^ , k ^ 4. The position therefore is this. All parties to the agreement of June 1939 have at one time or another broken their promises; Shaikh Said will or.ly be satisfied now with the final departure of Shaikh Mana and his party from Truoial Oman; Shaikh Mana has for the time being lost all support except in Sharjah, but both he and his party will not accept Shaikh Said's terms; Shaikh Sultan bin s a gr of Sharjah, actuated by his belief that he can overcome Shaikh Said and put Shaikh Mana into Dubai, is determined to support the latter and rejects all advice to rid himself of a dangerous incubus. Fighting therefore is inevitable, but it is difficult to foretell how deter mined it will be and what form operations will take. There is little doubt that Shaikh Said hopes to induce Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah, nephew of Shaikh Khalid of Kalba, to join him in the guise of a prospective candidate for the Shaikhdom /*«• 5 *• Shaikhdom of Sharjah., If he is successful in this then his tactics will probably be to organise a sort of guerilla warfare with frequent small raids on the outskirts of Shar jah, seizure of camels and goats etc., and generally to make life so unpleasant for the residents of Sharjah that they themselves will turn out Shaikh Sultan and accept Shaikh Humaid as their ruler. Mans and his party would then become outcasts. This plan however may fail owing to the impending return of Shaikh Khalid himself from the Haj. Shaikh Khalid seems to have lost all ambition and to wish to spend his remaining years in peace in Kalba. It is possible therefore that he will dissuade Humaid bin Abdullah from joining Shaikh Said. In that event Shaikh Said might decide on a full-dress attack on Sharjah town, 5 though admittedly Trucial Coast war tactics do not usually allow of frontal attacks in which quite a number of people may be killed. And if such an attack were jpade it would be possible for Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, by throwing all his resources into the struggle, to buy sufficient support in Dubai town to enable Iv'anata establish himself in Dubai while Shaikh Said was attacking Sharjah. I doubt however if Shaikh Sultan has either the initiative or the courage to do this. A third alternative is that both sides will expend a great deal of energy in shaking their fists at one another (to put it colloquially) and that the ultimate result may depend on the length of time which it takes for the inhabitants of either Dubai or Sharjah to lose patience and turn out their own ruler. This alternative seems to be excluded by news just received that firing is in progress between Dubai forces and Shaikh Mana and his supporters Ln Khan (a Sharjah ^ ^ 5 /-•2^3 - 6 - 5* In view of recent correspondence it is apparent that I am precluded from threatening either party with direct action in order to prevent fighting. For the reasons stated above mediation to bring about a peaceful settlement is no longer possible. Indeed, even were a 'settlement” possible, it would be as ineffective as the last unless I guaranteed the performance of all its conditions, and this I obviously cannot do. I have therefore contented myself with making all arrangements possible to ensure that there shall be the minimum interruption of the British Overseas Airways Corporation’s services and that no damage is caused to British interests either in Dubai or Sharjah. I have impressed upon Shaikh Said his responsibility at Dubai and I have informed him that since he has declared his intention to attack Sharjah I hold him responsible for ensuring that his forces do not approach the Fort and aerodrome at Sharjah. X have reminded him that in times of war British temper is liable to be short end -chat if our interests sustain any damage through his action he may expect instant retrioution. Shaikh Sultan has also been reminded bf his responsibilities, and since 1 have little faith in his ability to do anything effective I have also informed the guards at the Sharjah fort (who are without exception Batineh men with no local intere sts) that they are eating the 'Doula’s” bread and are in no circumstances to leave the aerodrome to join in any hostili ties that may occur in Sharjah town. In consultation with Captain Howes and with the Besidency Agent I have attempted to make arrangements to meet all eventualities to ensure the maintenance and safety of both flying boat and land plane services at Dubai and Sharjah. The circumstances in which one or the other or both must be interrupted have been dis cussed and I am hopeful that any interruption will b e v extremely /-* \ -s - 7 - extremely brief. I am also hopeful that it will be unnecessary to divert the flying boats from Dubai to Has al Khaimah. It may be noted that in to-day* s report on the firing at Khan Captain Howes states that the i Sharjah aerodrome and the road to Dubai are both open. 9/fc (a Political Agent, Bahrain §lcTelegram - GTC From - Political, Bahrain To - Captain Howes, Sharjah No. _ 47 Dated the 23rd ry 1940 IMPORTANT Imperial Airways state you have prohibited night stops Sharjah.

You will note c that he says that he is commenting by separate demi-official letter and the following are extracts from that letter t- '2. Shaikh Bashid bin Sa’id, whom I interviewed on Sunday morning, let slip that Dubai felt themselves to be too short of ammunition to make a serious attack on Sharjah. I have forwarded to you two applications from Shaikh Sa’id for import permits for a total of 40 f 000 rounds of ammunition (vide my memoranda hos.155 and 159 dated 10th and 12th March), and comment on this below. 3. Sharjhh is even more depleted, and it is possible that the visit of ’Abdulla bin Paris to Bahrain (vide para 2 (v) of my report for 29th February) may be with the idea of obtaining ammunition. He is not, however, likely to succeed in getting any from the Se’udis, I think; and will in any case find it difficult to bring any quantity from Hasa to Sharjah without something leaking out. *7 # As a first step, we can refuse all permits for Import of arms for as long as we think fit, and cer tainly anything on the scale of Shaikh 3a*id's application referred to in my second paragraph. I warned Shaikh Sa*id yesterday morning speaking of this matter, that the [on’ble Lieutenant-Colonel C. Q. Prior, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRR Resident/-Resident would want to be satisfied that the ammunition was not required for a renewal of the war; to which he gave the bare-faced answer that might have been antici pated* However, items (i) and (ii) of my memorandum No.155 dated the 10th March are actually from a separate application on behalf of Shaikh Hashar bin Maktum, who is a well behaved and reasonable person. I recommend that the two rifles be granted with 500 rounds of ammuni tion only for the present. 8. The shortage of ammunition should then combine with the natural characteristics of the particioants to prevent a further outbreak of hostilities........ ,f 2. In pre-war days we were moderately free with permits for arms and ammunition for the Trucial Coast, since the Shaikhs could then, if they had realised it, have obtained their requirements from Germany or Japan without even going through the formality of applying for No Objection Certificates. Ships of both nationalities paid occasional calls to the Trucial Coast ports. Now however the situation is very different, and a refusal to grant permits means that the Trucial Coast people cannot obtain the arms and ammunition they want. My own view is that we should refuse absolutely to issue permits for more than an odd sporting rifle (with 100 rounds of ammunition), at any rate until some settlement has been reached between Dubai and Sharjah and Shaikh Mana providing for a reasonable prospect of pennanency. This should apply to all Shaikhs since there is little doubt that if Dubai, for instance, is refused a permit he will try to get his requirements through Abu Dhabi. 3. Admittedly this may result in a certain amount of arms traffic via the Saudi Bedu tribes, but these tribes can usually get hold of nothing more than obsolete weapons and very elderly ammunition and I do not think we heed take it as a/-as a serious menace* 4* I am inclined to agree with Howes that we might let Shaikh Hashar bin Maktum have something, though I would cut it down to one rifle and 100 rounds of ammunition* 5. I do not know what the position is in Kuwait but it is interesting to observe that Shaikh Said expects to be able to purchase quite a lot of ammunition there* 6* Incidentally I shall be commenting on the rest of Howes* demi-official letter in a separate communication.

D.O.No•C/222-22/8• Dated the 19th Merch 1940. Will you please refer to your demi-official letter $0.19 dated the 12th March 1940 on the subject of the Dubai- Sharjah hostilities ? 2. I saw the Political Resident for a short time on his return from India and raised with him the question of direct intervention to put an end to present or future hostilities (I had not at that time received your demi-official letter Ko.19). The Resident wants me to visit the Coast a.^ain before submitting final recommendations, but I am afraid I shall not be able to get there before you leave. Meanwhile I would like to have your views on one or two aspects of the whole question. 3. In the first place who are these people who criticise us for not stopping the war ? If they are Dubai or Sharjah inhabitants the obvious reply is n Set rid of your own Shaikh if you are not satisfied with him, and do not expect us to do it for you'. I should not be very greatly concerned myself with any complaints either on the Coast or elsewhere in the world that we have not taken sufficient interest in the preservation of neaceful conditions on the Coast, as there is little doubt that we should earn far greater hostile criti cism by direct action which, however admirable its purpose might be, would be construed everywhere as the breaking of our pledge not to interfere with their internal affairs. And as for the 1820 Treaty to which you refer in an official letter, it must not be forgotten that the Treaty related tein J. B. Howes, f ^45* mainly A Political Officer, Trucial Coast, SHARJAH.mainly to maritime affairs, and in so far as it did touch on fighting by land it definitely recognised that the Shaikhs had the right to conduct formal war between them selves. That however is a side issue. 4. You will recollect that at one time I myself was very much inclined to put a prohibition on war between Sharjah and Dubai and to take very strong action to prevent it, but that was solely in order to ensure that there should be no interruption of the Hknpire Air route and no damage to our interests generally. Although I fully realise that you must have had a very anxious time wondering whether a stray bullet would not damage one of the Imperial Airways’ aircraft or a passenger or even one of the Imperial Airways’ staff, still we have to go by results and the fact remains that there has not been any substantial interference and definitely no damage done. That being the case what arguments exactly can we offer His Majesty’s Government for active intervention now ? As I have indicated above I discount local public opinion and I very much doubt if you are right in thinking that our future operations in the hinterland would be facilitated by more active effort along the Coast at this stage. Indeed the contrary might very well be the result, in that the hinterland Shaikhs might argue, at any rate to themselves, that such direct inter vention by us on the Coast is a clear warning that we should never allow them to manage their own affairs in their own way once we penetrated their country. 5. And now for another point. Supposing we tell oaid that we are not going to allow him to attack Sharjah; are we not then hound in common fairness to insist that f'ana and his party leave not only Sharjah but the whole Trucial Coast ? Whatever the rights or wrongs of the quarrel between them may be, the fact remains that Juma’s son murdered /-- 3 - murdered Mana’s brother and in the normal course of events Mana or one of his family should murder Said or one of his. It follows that there is more to be done than merely telling Mana that he must not concentrate Bedouin for an attack on Dubai; he and his party must be removed from any Trucial Coast town from which he can organise a murder in Dubai without undue difficulty. Of course Shaikh Said says at present that he would be content if Mana and the .AUlad Buti were in Has al Khaimah and that he would then not object to the rest of the party being in Sharjah, I very much doubt it, from past experience. And certainly steps would have to be taken to ensure that neither i ana nor the Aulad Buti ever visited Sharjah; and that in turn means threatening Sultan bin Saqr with direct action if he ever allowed them to return even for comparatively short visits. Consequently there seems reason to argue that if we are to contemplate direct intervention we must issue three ultimata, one Shaikh Said that he is not. to attack Sharjah, trie second to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr that he is nox, to harbour Mana or any of his party or allow them to visit his town, and xhe third to Mana and his party that they are to g t clean off the Trucial Coast. And then where would they go ? ?hey are not wanted in Bahrain, and I am not very certain that they would be welcome at t.'usaat or on the Batineh Coast. It might be argued that they would be safe in Abu Dhabi but I cannot see Shakhbut agreeing to accept them. And wherever , , , v hfivp to be the medium for pay- they were we should probably nave ing allowances and so on. 6. All the above does not mean that I am fanally opposed to active intervention, - indeed I see many advantages in putting our foot down, but we have to convince not only our- „ sident, His Majesty's Government and selves but also the ne n the Government of India that it is quite deimitely4 / right thing to do. So will you think over the considera tions which I have set out above and let me have your further views on them ? And I should like also to know whether you think that the warning that we should stoo any ship, whether a mailboat or a dhow, clearing from India for either Sharjah or Dubai in the event of either of them proving recalcitrant in the face of a threat would be sufficient to bring them to heel. We would stand a far better chance of achieving action if we could offer a proposal which would not involve bursting bombs or shells or machine gun fire 1 Yours sincerely,I shou. id be grai bin Saqr and 4. ~ 1 1 m ‘ uis Secretary 4^x1^ recently and V«i w cl w 1 &lt; dates and hav ing fail©! rifles and am \7aen asked v.b .at his pu he was going there to If* *1 f •P'j \ j I X Ct V v X \aJL X am OU Vs DUX' extreme^ r VaX -M» v ci\ an 1 *5 * -/ M &amp; £* -+» V- V.4 latter came here &gt; excuse r purcn&amp;sxng Kuwait• said Dbiac failed there to arrange for any .tion, he then applied for s visa iis purpose was in visiting Kuw&amp;l ?e to purchase dates for the Shai jah* X object to being told lies like this but I even snore to being regarded as such a fool as to believe them and I have therefore refused to give him a visa.

I am sorry you will be coming after I have gone, but will do my best to analyse my views on the points you have raised# 2. Local criticism# (i) This is, as you surmise, largely from inhabitants from Dubai and Sharjah, notably (a; the merchant community of Dubai, and (b) the Hyderabad! community ( British subjects numbering over 250) of Sharjah, who have trade contacts with Hyderabadis in Dubai# It is, however, a common remark^ even outside the two towns that 'there can be no solution unless H.M.G. steps in' s it was made to me as far off as Fujairah, by Shaikh Hamad ash- Sharqi# (ii) I agree that the rejoinder ' if you don*t like your Shaikh, get rid of him ' would be throughly justified ina democratically constituted country; but (a) can we suggest the 'getting rdd' of a Shaikh — which could only be understood in one sense by 90 % of local people ? and ib) can we expect corporate feeling or action from peoplor who have neither a method nor a tradition of displaying it ? , (iii) I meant to make it clear from the ixs. phrasing of certain parts of my d#o. letter no.' 19, that I myself did not take local opinion soseriously as the possibility of the spread of this opinion to more important Arab areas# Conclusion . I do not go all the way to with your expressed disregard for this factor# 3« ' The assassination question#. (i) When I spoke in my previous letter of the quarrel 'going underground', I had equally in mind the posibility ofSa'id killing iaani'as of teani' killing sa'id (or juma'). In fact, H in nmay A ways the former is the more probable, as lm#L' is less well guarded* and I do not anticipate any such delicacy of feeling on the part of Sa f id and Juma' as the thought - * We got Has bar lafct time* now it is Mani' s turn to go for us.' (ii) An assassin can be as easily hired at Raw al Khaima or Hamasah as in Sharjah. \ (iii) No sanount of money will make as assassin commit suicide; and I consider that tbe Dubai sheikhs are too well guarded for as assassin to do the deed, and live. (iv) An assassination, to be any real use, must be followed by a coup d'etat. Mani 1 lost his chance to do this over the oct. blinding incident; and I feel that Sa'id is going to step more carefully in future, and not give another such chance. (v) I feel that this may be a mere debating point; but if we hold your view that local opinion is not worth regarding seriously, need we worry if it says 'tthey arekeeping kani» safe in Sharjah so that he can kill Salid' ? Conclusion* This consideration need not oblige us to insist on the exiles leaving Sharjah. 4. Where can the exiles g o? (i) Mani' came to see me on Thursday evening, and said he was thinking of going to Bahrain. I asked if anyone was going with him, but his reply was evasive. I told him that 1 fully with agreed tkxfc his leaving the Coast; but that I must refer to you proper about his going to Bahrain, and that if he went he must make/dom - -estic arrangements and not reckon on enjoying Sbeikh Hamad's hospitality indefinitely. You now write that he is not wanted there (ii) The available places therefore seem to fall into groups B ahrain and Muscat; Abu Dhabi, ftjman and Utnm al Qaiwain » Will not have them. Has al Khaima and Hamasah . They may go there, but will not stay. They can do as much harm form there as from Sharjah.~3*» Tndia and *Ir»Q. got Tf they live in either we have/to arrange allowances tor th«s« (iii) If we leave them in Sharjah, under a satisfactory threat to behave themselves, they become useless to ffh«-nrh «mi*^t» as instruments of intrigue, and become merely mouths to fill* would be a punishment for him worthy of the Mikade* Hr) If we move them out of Sharjah, we shall have recurring trouble in keeping them out permanently* Conclusion* They had better be left in Sharjah, without allowances, for the presenti and X do not think we should involve ourselves in any prohibition or copulsion as to their place of residence* 5* Stoppage of sea traffic* (i) Are we not bound by agreement to have the B.I.Mail call at Sharjah ? (ii) If we stop the B.l., we must presumably stop Japanese steamers also* Will this not cause international complications ? (iii) Chow traffic from India is very small* fhe bulk of dhow traffic to Dubai ~ Sharjah is from the following places, inorder of importance - Basrah, South Persia and Makran, Qatif ,Batinah« India comes after Batinah for Dhow traffic* (iv) Only the up mail is of importance as far as cargo is concerned ; this means that we only hit once fortnight* tv) The loss to exporters in India should perhapk be taken into account* tvi) We are, presumably, going to intervene in order to maintain peaceful trade and communications* Is a trade blockade a legitimate weapon for this purpose ? (vii) The local people who will feel the pinch have ftot the intelligence to blame the Shaikhs rather than us i nor have they the influence to make them change their policy* Conclusion* I do not think that this threat is sufficient tobring offenders to heel} but would merely hit the people we want to protect© 6 . jifhat arguments can we offer to H.M.G. in support of possible active intervention ?

(v) Although fck I appreciate your argument about the reaction-5- on hinterland Shaikhs, will it realy pay us in the long run to gee up country on the terms - 'the British 1 oh* they are harm- ion of powerful neighbours, who never the less give a square deal and pay for what they take, is more what we want# Conclusion# to prevent a further breach of the pax Britannica by a family quarrel in go which a handful/Shaikhs have chosen to drag their helpless subjects# 7. As a J^er to the whole of the above, Shaikhs Khalid and Muhammad bin 'Ali were in Dhaid together on March 19th, and on that night and the next Shaikh Sultan bin Saq^s guards were told not to leave their towers until after sun rise# shaikh Khalid should have no doubt of our attitude after a fairly suggestive conversation I had with him while hostilities were still in ^BshxKxs progress, on the lines - ' peace can only be secured by the intervention of important Shaikhs like you, yourself a c^awasimi, and possessing considerable 'influence' in Sharjah#' this Coast, and nothing produceJbut the 'ridiculus mus' * so I would hesitate even to hope for a solution from this quarter# less enough# Can't even keep order on the Coast.'

Hi ^ Memorandum I beg to report the following for your information on the subject of Dubdi/Sharjah/Mani* problem 2* When the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah arranged a i'ruce between Shaikh 3a‘id and Shaikh sultan bin ^&gt;aqr on 9th March, he undertook to remove shaikh iiani* and Auwlad Bati ffom Sharjah within three months* On 22nd Shaikh sultan bin Salim arranged a meeting between Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr and Shaikh sa*id which took place at Nahadah(half way between Sharjah and Dubai)* While at Nahdah Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr took Shaikh Sa f id on one side and had a private talk with him* Shaikh sultan expressed his regret for the past events and promised to do everything which would please Shaikh Sa»id* Shaikh 5a*id said that he had nothing against Sharjah except Mani* and his party* That empty promise and hollow words were not sufficient unless supported by deed* The Shaikh of Sharjah then said to Shaikh Sa'id that he was send ing his Secretary, •Abdullah bin Paris,to him with a private message* When the Shaikh of Sharjah went to Ajman on the morning of 24th March(see my memorandum flo.C/195-3/5(c) dated 30th March) •Abdullah bin Paris did not accompany him but went to Dubai* He went to Shaikh Sa’id and then to Shaikh jum'ah* AS Shaikh Bashid bin Sa*id was out sporting he waited until he returned after sunset* •Abdullah bin Paris did not carry any important message from the Shaikh of Sharjah to any of the three Shaikhs except flattery by which he tried to bluff them about the good intentions of shaikh Sultan bin Saqr* In the evening he told Shaikh Sa f id that he had a tin at Daira which contained some nails and asked for a permit to take it to Sharjah without being examined* Shaikh sa f id gave him a permit to this effect* At about 10 p*m* he crossed to Daira in order to return to Sharjah. Shaikh Sa'id sent one of his men withhim who left him at Daira and then returned to ghandaghah* Another servant of Shaikh Sa’id at Daira (obviously he was kept on watch) saw the tin with 'Abdullah bin Faris when he wanted to put it in the car and asked about its sontents* * Abdullah bin Faris replied that it had nails and he tfed a permit from the Shaikh which exempted him from examining the tin# The servant insisted on examining the tin and without hestitating turned the tin upside down# The tin was found to contain nails on the top below which 400 rounds of ammunition were kept# The servant took the ammunition to Shaikh Sa'id and allowed 'Abdullah bin Faris to return to Sharjah# At the request of Shaikh sultan bin Has al Khaimah, Shaikh Sa'id returned the ammunition to Shai kh Sultan bin Saqr, who alleged that he had them in Daira long before the trouble broke out, on 29th March# a servant of sha-tirii sa'id named Rashid bin Julaiyil was accused of selling these from the Shaikh's supplies# He ran;

two brotherly States • X was sure he would be successful in inducing the two parties to accept every possible and reasonable proposal put forward by him in their interests; and thought that there was no need for others to interfere with him# Shaikh sultan said he was sure that he could not be successful unless he was backed up by the Kesidency Agent* I expressed hope that he would be successful and said that I could not take part in any discussions without instructions from my higher authorities* 8 0 The same evening shaikh Uani came to me and after informing me about the suggestion made to him by the Shaikh, he said that Shaikh sultan bin Salim had asked him to come to me and ask me to help Shaikh Sultan in arranging matters between them and Shaikh sa'id.
