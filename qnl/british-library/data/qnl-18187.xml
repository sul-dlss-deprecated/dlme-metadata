Head Quarters, Camp, Chiliamcalla, ICM January 1849. M y L ord ,—Major Mackeson, your Lordship's Political Agx-nt with my Camp, officially communicated to me on the 10th instant, the fall of Attok, and the advance of Sirdar Chuttur Singh, in order to concentrate his force with the Army in front, under Shere Singh, already amounting to from thirtv to forty thousand men with 62 Guns, conchidino- his letter thus:— 44 I would urge, in the event of your Lordship's finding yourself strong enough with the Army ' under your command to strike an effectual blow at the enemy in our front, that the blow ' should be struck with the least possible delay.' Concurring entirely with Major Mackeson, and feeling that I was perfectly competent effectually to overthrow Shere Singh's army, I moved from Loah Tibbah, at daylight on the l'2th, to Dingee, about 12 miles. Having learnt from my spies, and from other sources of in formation, that Shere Singh still held with his right the villages of Lukhneewalla and Futteh Shah ke Chuck, having the great body of his force at the village of Lollianwalla, with his left at Russool, on the Jhelum, strongly occupying the Southern extremity of a low range of diffi cult hills, intersected by ravines, which extended nearly to that village; 1 made my arrangements accordingly that evening, and communicated them to the Commanders of the several Divi sions; but to ensure correct information as to the nature of the country, which I believed to be excessively difficult, and ill adapted to the advance (A' a regular army, I determined upon moving on this village, with a view to reconnoitre. On the morning of the 13th, the force advanced. I made a considerable detour tomy right, partly in order to distract the enemy's attention, but principally to get as clear as I could of the jungle, on which, it appeared, that the enemy mainly relied. We approached this village about 12 o'clock, ami I found, on a mound close to it, a strong piquet of the enemy's Cavalry and Infantry, which we at once dispersed, obtaining from the mound a very extended view of the country before us, and the enemy drawn out in battle ar ray, he having, either during the night or that morning, moved out of his several positions, and occupied the ground in our front, which, though not a dense, was still a difficult jungle, hh right in advance of Futteh Shah ke Chuck, and his left on the furrowed hills before de scribed. The day being so far advanced, I decided upon taking up a position in rear of the village, in order to reconnoitre my front, finding that I could not turn the enemy's flanks, which rested upon a dense jungle extending nearly to Hailah, which I had previously occupied for some time, and the neighbourhood of which I knew, and upon the raviney hills near Russool, with out detaching a force to a distance; this I considered both inexpedient and dangerous. The Engineer Department had been ordered to examine the country before us, and the Quar ter Master General was in the act of taking up ground for tiie encampment, when the enemy advanced some Horse Artillery, and opened a fire on the skirmishers in front of the village. I immediately ordered them to be silenced by a few rounds from heavy Guns which ad vanced to an open space in front of the village. Their fire was instantly returned by thai of nearly the whole of the enemy's Field Artillery; thus exposing the position of his Guns, which the jungle had hitherto concealed,. It was now evident that the enemy intended to fight, and would probably advance his Guns so as to reach the encampment during the night. I therefore drew up, in order of battle. Sir Walter Gilbert's Division on the right, flanked by Brigadier Pope's Brigade of Cavalry, which I strengthened by the 14th Dragoons, well aware that .the enemy was strong in Cavalry upon his left. To this were attached three Troops of Horse Artillery under Lieutenant Colonel Grant. The heavy Guns were in the centre. C Brigadier General Campbell's Division formed the left, flanked by Brigadier White s Bri gade oi Cavalry, and three Troops of Horse Artillery under Lieutenant Colonel Brind. The Field Batteries were with the Infantry Divisions.[ 112 1 ' Thus formed, the Troops were ordered to lie down whilst the heavy Guns under Major Horsford, ably seconded by Brevet Majors Ludlow and Sir Richmond Shakespear, opened a well directed and powerful tire upon the enemy's centre, where his Guns appeared principally to be placed; and this fire was ably supported on the flanks by the Field-Batteries of the Infan try Divisions. After about an hour's fire, that of the enemy appeared to be, if not silenced, sufficiently dis abled to justify an advance upon his position and Guns. I then ordered my left Division to advance, which had to move over a greater extent of ground, and in front of which the enemy seemed not to have many (runs. Soon after 1 direct ed Sir Walter Gilbert to advance, and sent orders to Brigadier Pope to protect the flank and support the movement. Brigadier Penny's Brigade was held in reserve, while the Irregular Cavalry under Brigadier llearsey, with the 20th Native Infantry, was ordered to protect the enormous amount of provision and baggage that so hampers the movement of an Indian Army. Sometime after the advance I found that Brigadier Pennycuick's Brigade had failed in main taining the position it had carried, and immediately ordered Brigadier Penny's reserve to it support; but Brigadier General Campbell, with that steady coolness and military decision fo which he is so remarkable, having pushed on his left Brigade and formed line to his right, carried every thing before him, and soon overthrew that portion of the enemy which had ob tained a temporary advantage over his right Brigade. This last Brigade, I am informed, mistook for the signal to move in double time, the action of their brave leader. Brigadier Pennycuick, and Lieutenant Colonel Brookes, (two Officers not surpassed for sound judgment and military daring in this or any other Army) who waived their swords over their heads as they cheered on their gallant comrades. 1 his unhappy mis take led to the Europeans outstripping the Native Corps, which could not keep pace, and ar riving completely blown at a belt of thicker jungle, where they got into some contusion, and Lieutenant Colonel Brookes leading the 24th, was killed between the enemy's Guns. At this moment a large body of Infantry which supported their Guns, opened upon them so destruc tive a fire that the Brigade was forced to retire, having lost their gallant and lamented leader, Brigadier Pennycuick, and the three other Field Officers of the 24th, and nearly half the Regi ment, before it gave way. The Native Regiment, when it came up, also suffered severely. In justice to this Brigade, I must be allowed to state, that they behaved heroically, and, but for their too hasty, and consequently disorderly advance, would have emulated the conduct ot their left Brigade, which, left unsupported for a time, had to charge to their front and right, wherever an enemy appeared. The Brigade ot Horse Artillery on their left, under Lieutenant Colonel Brind, judiciously and gallantly aiding, maintained an effective fire. Major General Sit J. Thackwell, on the extreme left and rear, charged the enemy's Cavalry wherever they showed themselves. The right attack of Infantry, under that able Officer Major General Sir alter Gilbert, was most praiseworthy and successful. The left Brigade, under Brigadier Mountain, advanced under a heavy fire upon the enemy's Guns, in a manner that did credit to the Brigadier and his gallant Brigade, which came first into action and suffered severely: the right Brigade, un der Brigadier Godby, ably supported the advance. This Division nobly maintained the character of the Indian Army, taking and spiking the whole of the enemy's Guns in their front, and dispersing the Sikhs wherever they were seen. The Major-General reports most favorably of the fire of his Field Battery. The right Brigade of Cavalry, under Brigadier Pope, was not, I regret to say, so successful. Either by some order, or misapprehension of an order, they got into much confusion, hamper ed the fine Brigade of Horse Artillery, which, while getting into action against the body of the enemy 's Cavalry that was coming down upon them, had their Horses separated from their Guns by the false movements of our Cavalry, and, notwithstanding the heroic conduct of the Gunners, four of those Guns were disabled to an extent which rendered their witlidrawl, at the moment, impossible. The moment the Artillery was extricated, and the Cavalry re-formed, a few rounds put to flight the enemy that had occasioned this confusion.[ 113 ] With tin's exception, the conduct of the Troops generally was most exemplary. Some Corps, both European and Native, acted under most trying circumstances, (from the temporary failure on our left, centre and right, and the cover which the jungle afforded to the enemy's movements,) and with a gallantry worthy of the highest admiration. Although the enemy, who defended not only his guns but his position with desperation, was driven in much confusion, and with heavy loss, from every part of it, and the greater part of his Field Artillery was actually captured, the march of Brigades to their flanks to repel parties that had rallied, and the want of numbers, and consequent support to our right flank, aided by the cover of the jungle and the close of the day, enabled him, upon our further advance in pur suit, to return and carry off unobserved the greater portion of the guns we had thus gallantly carried at the point of the bayonet. I remained with Brigadier-General Campbell's Division, which had been re-inforced by Brigadier Mountain's Brigade, until near 8 o'clock, in order to effect the bringing in of the captured ordnance, and of the wounded, and I hoped to bring in the rest of the guns next morn ing. But I did not feel justified in remaining longer out. The night was very dark; I knew not how far I had advanced. There were no wells nearer than the line of this village. The troops had been arduously employed all day, and there was every appearance of a wet night: rain did fall before morning. I should have felt great satisfaction if I were enabled to state that my expectations in regard to the guns had been realized, but although a Brigade of Cavalry under Brigadier White, with a troop of Horse Artillery, were on the ground soon after daylight, we found that the enemy, assisted by the neighbouring villagers, had carried off their guns, excepting twelve which we had brought in the night before. Most of the captured waggons I had caused to be blown up before leaving the ground. The victory was complete as to the total overthrow of the enemy, and his sense of utter discomfiture and defeat will, I trust, soon be made apparent; unless, indeed, the rumours pre valent this day of his having been joined by Chuttur Singh, prove correct. I am informed Lhalthe'tuss of rtre 8-Hdrs^ias been vciy-greaL, and xrhiefty amongst their old and tried soldiers. In no action do I remember seeing so many of an enemy's slain upon the same space.—Sobraon, perhaps, only excepted. I have now, my Lord, stated the general movements of this Army previous to, and during the action of Chilian walla, and as that action was characterised by peculiar features which ren dered it impossible for the Commander-in-Chief to witness all the operations of the force, I shall beg leave to bring prominently to your Lordship's notice the names of the several Offi cers and Corps particularly mentioned by the Divisional Commanders. I have already stated the obligation I am under to Major-Generals Sir Joseph Thackwell and Sir Walter Gilbert, and to Brigadier-General Campbell, for their most valuable services, I warmly concur with them in the thanks which they have expressed to the several Brigadiers, and Officers commanding corps, and to the troops generally. Sir Joseph Thackwell names, with much satisfaction. Brigadier White's conduct of his bri gade; Major Yerbury, commanding 3rd Light Dragoons; the gallant charge of Captain Unett, in command of a squadron of that corps; Major Mackenzie, commanding the 8 th, and Captain Wheatley, commanding the 5th Light Cavalry; and the conduct of Captain Moore, of the 8th, with a squadron detached in support of the Artillery. He further notices the assist ance he derived from the Zealand activity of Captain Pratt, Assistant Adjutant General, and Lieutenant Tucker, Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General of his division ; of Captain Cautley, Major of Brigade ^ of his Aide-de-Camp, Lieutenant Thackwell; and of Lieut. Simpson, Sub-Assistant Commissary-General. Brigadier-General Campbell speaks in terms of admiration of the 5th Brigade, led on bvthat distinguished Officer Brigadier Pennycuick, and particularly of the gallant exertions of Her Majesty's 24th Foot, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Brookes; and the good and steady advanee-of the 25th and 45th Native Infantry, under the command of Lieutenant Colo nel Corbett and Major Williams, He particularizes the undaunted example set his Brigade by Hoggau ; the cotinued steadiness and gallantry of Her Majesty's 61st Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Macleod, under the most trying circumstances; the distinguished con duct of Major Flemyng and the Officers of the 36th Native Infantry; and of the 46th Native Infantry under Mnjor Tudor; as also the able and zealous exertions of the Brigade-Major Caj[ H4 ] tain Keiller. The Brigadier-General also brings to notice his obligations to Major inckerf Assistant Adjutant General of the Array; and to Captain Goldie and Lieutenant Irwin, o, the Engineers, who were sent to his assistance; and the cordial and able support which he received from Major Ponsonby, his Assistant Adjutant General; and particularly mentions the conduct of Ensign Garden, his Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General, and of Captain Haythorne, his Aide-de-Camp ; further naming Lieutenant Grant, of H. M. 24th Regiment, and Lieutenant Powys, of H. M. 61st, who attended him as Orderly Officers; and of Lieutenant and Adjutant Shad well, of H. M. 98 th, who was with him as a volunteer. Sir Walter Gilbert speaks warmly of the charge led by Brigadier Mountain against a large battery of the enemy, and followed up on his right by Brigadier Godby, and of the subsequent conduct of these Officers; also of the conduct of Major Chester, Assistant Adjutant-Generab and Lieutenant Galloway, Deputy Assistant Quarter-Master General of the division; of Lieut- Colt, his Aide-de-Camp; of Captain Sherwill and Lieutenant Macdonell, Majors of Brigade; and of Captain Glasfurd, and Lieutenant W, E. Morton, of the Engineers. The Major-General further mentions the undaunted bravery on this occasion of H. M. 29th Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Congrave; the distinguished conduct of the 2nd Euro pean Regiment, under Major Steel; and the manner in which Majors Smith and Way, of the 29th, and Major Talbot, of the 2nd Europeans, seconded their able commanders. He also expresses his thanks to Lieutenant -ColonelJack, commanding the 30th Native Infantry; Ma jor Bam field, commanding the 5G Native Infantry, who was mortally wounded ; and Major McCausland, commanding the 70th Native Infantry; for the manner in which they led their Regiments into action : naming, likewise. Captain Nembhard, of the 56th y who succeeded to the command of that corps; Captain Dawes, commanding the field battery of the division; and Captain Robbins, of the 15th, who acted as his Aide-de-Camp. The reserve, consisting of the 15th Native Infantry, and eight companies of the 69th Na tive Infantry, was ably handled by Brigadier Penny, well seconded by Lieutenant-Colonels Sibbald and Mercer, commanding the corps. The Brigadier particularly mentions the steady conduct of the rifle company of the 69th, under Captai n Siss more; and acknowledges the ser vices of Captain Macpherson, his Major of Brigade; and Brevet-Captain Morris, of the 20th Native Infantry, who attended him as Orderly Officer. Brigadier-General Tennant, comanding the Artillery division, rendered me every aid, and presided over the noble arm of which lie is the head, most creditably to himself and most bene- ficiallv to the service. The Brigadier-General particularly mentions Brigadier J. Brooke, who commanded the whole of the Horse Artillery; Brigadier Huthwaite, commanding the Foot Artillery; Lieutenant-Colonels C. Grant, and F. Brind, Major R. Horsford, and Major Mowatt, all of whom were in important commands. He further brings to notice Captain J. Abercrom- bie, Deputy Assistant Adjutant General; Lieutenant Tombs, Deny. Assistant Quarter Master General; his Aide-de-Camp, Lieut. Olpherts; Captain Hogge, Commissary of Ordnance; and Lieut. De Tessie', who attended him as Orderly Officer. I have, in the beginning of this Despatch, noticed the services of Brevet-Major Sir Richmond Shakes pear and Brevet-Major Ludlow, in command of the heavy Batteries, under the general superintendence of Major Horsford; and it only remains for me to add, that the conduct of Major Fordyce, Captains Warner and Duncan,' Lieuts. Robinson and Walker, commanding Troops-and Field Batteries, as well as the officers and men of the Artillery, generally, have been named in terms of praise by the Divisional Commander. Lieuts. C. V. Cox and E. Kaye, Brigade-Majors of this arm, have been also named by their respective Brigadiers. From the Engineer Department, under Major Tremenheere, I received active assistance, ably aided by Captain Durand, Lieutenants R. Bird, Smith, and Goodwyn. To the General Staff I am greatly indebted ; Lieutenant Colonel Gough, C. P&gt;., Quarter Master General; and Major Lugard, Acting Adjutant General; and Captain C.

Dimdas, C. B. Commanding the Bombay Division of the Field Force, both of which I shall be obliged by your submitting to the Right Hon'ble the Comman- der-in-Chief. The steady advance of both columns under their respective Commanders, Brigadier Stalker, C. B. and Brigadier Markham, (which as regarded that under the latter was but temporarily checked from the necessity of entering the city by the left breach) ensured the early realiza tion of what each had been directed to aim at; and by sunset the city was in complete pos session of our gallant troops, whose conduct throughout was remarkable for humanity to the unarmed inhabitants they occasionally met; and not less so for the severity with which the opposition of the enemy was overcome, from street to street, many of which were narrow and intricate, and several barricaded. In the letters accompanying, the gallantry and good services of various officers are particu larized, and on the fall of the citadel it will be my pleasing duty to take up that strain re garding many. It will however be better timed now to mention the spirited proposition, on the 1st instant, of Lieutenant Colonel Franks, C. B,, to escalade the citadel during the assault of the citv, provided I placed 500 of each Regiment of the Ist Brigade under his command. After due consideration of this suggestion, I deemed it most eligible to forego it, as I had not time to examine into the difficulties that might have attended it; nor would the hour fixed for the assault have been auspicious, unless I had deferred it till dawn of the 3rd. Brigadier Stalker has brought to Brigadier Dundas's notice the conduct of Color Serjeant John Bennett, 1st Fusiliers, on the 2nd instant, and I cannot forbear my testimony to the joy ful feelings which it excited in myself and officers of the staff around me, when noticing his planting the British standard on the crest of the breach, and maintaining it there in the midst of the musf|uetry fire of the enemy, until the troops had passed. The troops of the Bombay column suffered much from an explosion during the night of a magazine in the city. I beg to enclose casualty lists, of which the total of each column is as follows:—• B engal D ivision.

S ir ,—I have the honor to report for your information, that, according to division orders, at 1 o'clock on the '2nd I proceeded with the Brigade under my command to the Mundec Ava, the point of rendezvous with the left column j at ~ o clock, we reccncd oideis to mo^e To tht Delhi (iate, from whence the assault was to be made. At a quarter past 3 o'clock a salvo being fired from the Delhi Grate Battery (the signal agreed upon for the assault)^ the leading companies of Her Majesty's 3*2d Regiment under Capt. Smyth, commanding tlie Grenadier com pan v, moved on to storm the breach; upon passing the broken gioiind and luimd out works of the Gate under a heavy fire of mate!docks, they descended a deep hollow, and found to their surprise the city wall in front, about 30 feet in height, unbMched, and totally im practicable, being fairly concealed from view from the nature of the ground until directly upon it. Captain Smvth immediately, and with great judgment and promptitude, decided upon re tiring, and rejoined the column with the loss of several men, which loss however would have been very seriously increased, both to the leading companies and the column, had then 1)( (.u any hesitation on his part. I proceeded at once to the breach at the Khoonee Boorj, which I found had already been entered by the left column, and made our way down the ramparts and stre ets on our right to the Delhi* Gate, and from thence to that part of the city close to the DomIiU Gate, and di rectly in front of the fort. ' _ ^ --.„ i i - teem* The eiTemv offered considerable opposition in the narrow streets and on the ramparts, which w ere strongly barricaded; but the troops carried all before them, and belore dark t hat part of the city was in our possession, and we connected our posts with those thrown out from the left column. To Col. Brooke, Major Lloyd, and Capt. Lloyd, in command of Regiments, and to all under my command, both officers and men, 1 have to return my thanks tor their steadiness and prompt obedience throughout to my orders. To Major Napier of the Engineers, who accompanied me, 1 am deeply indebted tor the very valuable services he rendered me throughout the afternoon.

Severn I acts of o-allantryhave been brought to my notice, particularly on the part of Color Serjeant Hemiett; of the' 1st Fusiliers, which I shall take au opportunity of reporting to the proper quarter. The suburbs between the Delhi Gate and the left breach were occupied by pickets from the Ist Brigade under Major Dennis, 60th Rifles, a company of the 6(lth Rifles, in.dei C ap- t iiu Douolas beiu' stationed in the houses opposite the breach, m the khooiioe ooij, t',. cover the advance of the storming party, and two companies under (apta ins (.eorge and Sibt^e to cover the advance of the Bengal column. Returns of casualties are herewith enclosed, F iiom BRIOADTlvR F, SIALKKK, t. n., Commanding 2nd Infantry Brigade Bombay Column, To THE ASSISTANT ADJUTANT GENERAL, Bombay i^olnmn, Jblooltau f ield Force, Camp, before Mooltan, January 184.°. I ,1 0 uivself the honor to report for the information of Brigadier the Honorable 11. the Bombay Column Mooltan Field Force that on the after- ^Zi oi 'thc 'ind January, the Brigade under my command was formed m the order laid[ 282 ] ■ V- down for them (vide instructions A. and B.) under cover within about two hundred yards of the breach, the approach to which was fully exposed to a file from musketry Zumbooruks. i he column gained the top ol the breach at about half past 3 p. m . with much regularity, under a very galling fire, but when they reached the summit, found themselves in a sort of enclosure, from which there was only one regular exit by a narrow lane on the right, and over alow house into the 'Khoonee Boorj.' The enemy had excavated a trench parallel to the breach, which contracted the space still more; the nature of the ground therefore rendered it utterly impossible to preserve any regu lar formation, and the ofiicers pushed on with the men nearest them to carry out, as far a? pos sible, the instructions to advance in three columns. The column was detained nearly twenty minutes by the obstacles at the top of the breach. The leading column of three companies of the Fusiliers having lost their commander, Captain Leith, who was dangerously wounded soon after crossing the breach, pushed down the lane to the right under Lieut. Gray, and was in part the cause of the enemy abandoning the 'Khoonee Boorj.' It fortunately happened that two short ladders were procured and placed by Bengal Sappers under Lieut. Olipliant against the house on the left, just as the enemy found their communication with the town threatened; they were therefore obliged to defend both the lane and the tower, and their re sistance was consequently less energetic. As soon as the ladders were placed, the column which had to advance by the ramparts to the south, pushed its way along for some distance, bur fortunately followed the retreating enemy along one of the streets, which eventually led them to the end of the town near the Lahore Gate. A Company being left at this point, 'the column returned along the streets nearest the ramparts to the Bohur Gate, where it remained during the night, as it was known that the Pak Gate was in possession of the Bengal 72nd, and a Company of the 4th Rifles was sent back to the Hurn Gate. During the night one of the enemy's powder magazines close to the gateway blew up, burying several of our men in the ruins ; it was impossible to guard against such an accident ; indeed it is only sur prising it was the only one on the South side, for the enemy's ammunition was lying about in great quantities , and there was nothing to disti nguish their magazines from the other houses. In the morning TaeTTteiiciuLs Pultard ami x \Iaxwdi, wuff the Bengal Sappers, removed a consi derable quantity of powder from another magazine close to a burning house, and threw it over the wall, where it exploded without doing am mischief. T he proceedings of the other column were similar ; they all pushed quite through the town, left parties in advance posts, and retired to more open ground in the centre of the town. W hen the left column, which was intended to go by the ramparts, and leave guards at the gates, had struck into the town, an application was made to Col. Dundas, who sent two com panies, Her Majesty's 60th Rifles, to hold the gates. The other columns had, however, exceeded their instructions, for a Company of the 72d Ben gal Native Infantry had crossed the town and obtained possession of the Pak, and the road to the Hurn Gate, before the 60th Rifles arrived. The Pak Gate was cleared during the night by the Bengal Sappers, the Hurn Gate by th^ Bombay Sappers, and the Bohur Gate was nearly opened, when the explosion took place, which rendered it impossible to go on. It was opened next morning by the Bengal Sappers. It is quite impossible to say where the Engineer officers were; the troops were so scattered by the narrow lanes, that there were no distinct columns. The only real guide was to follow the retreating enemy, which was done. Not only are the ramparts so incomplete as to render a passage round them by a column of men quite impracticabie, but the parts which are complete were, at the time of the assault, crossed by traverses and cut up by small trenches. I he night closed before the communication between the different bodies could be effected, but by morning the troops were in communication with each other. It is to be regretted that we had not a couple of hours' daylight, as we should then have pro bably avoided the explosion of the magazine, but the town was as completely cleared of the enemy by dark, as it is at the present moment. 1 he steady and well directed fire of Her Majesty's 60th Rifles, kept down that of the enewiv very considerably while the troops were approaching the breach, and a discharge of grape thrownN &gt; [ 283 ] ■J on the top of the breach by Lieutenant Keir, Bombay Artillery, just over the heads of the Fusi liers, as they advanced, was of the utmost advantage to us ; but when the top was gained, and our men became mingled with the enemy, the fate of the day depended on the steadiness and courage of the Fusiliers ; both men and officers answered nobly to the call. Where all behaved so well, and the operations were on such an extended scale, it would be impossible for me to particularize each act of gallantry. I would therefore beg to refer the Brigadier Commanding the Division to the reports of officers commanding Regiments and posts, and merely mention such as came under my notice. The gallantry of the following Officers was conspicuous :—Capt. Tapp, Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, attached to my staff, who was wounded in capturing a gun on our first entering the town, whereby I was early deprived of his valuable assistance. Capt. Leith, 1st Fusiliers, commanding the storming party, who was very severely wounded; Lieutenants Daly and Mules, 1st Fusiliers. 1 would also bring to special notice the conduct of Color Serjeant John Bennett, 1st Fusiliers, who volunteered to accompany the storming party, and rushing up the breach planted the Union Jack on its crest, standing beside it until the whole Brigade had passed. The Color and staff are riddled with balls. I beg to mention the names of Major Mignon, commanding 1st Fusiliers, Major Mant, commanding 19th Regiment Native Infantry, Major Honner, commanding 4th Rifles, and Major Hobson, 1st Fusiliers, all of whom exerted themselves to the utmost, and were most suc cessful in their different arrangements. To Major Scott, commanding Engineers, I am particularly indebted for his able assistance and untiring zeal throughout the operations. My best thanks are also due to the following Engineer Officers for the zeal and activity they displayed in the different duties on which they were employed— Capt. Abercrombie and Lieut. Taylor, and other officers of the Bengal Engineers, whose names I am unfortunately unabT5 td ^ifel! TjeliT^ nanf Itcnd all and Berthon^of the Bombay Sappers, and 2nd Lieutenants Playfairand Fuller^ of the same corps. To the following officers temporarily attached to my Staff, my best thanks are due: — Lieutenant Follexfen, Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General. Lieutenant Henry, Post Master to the Force. I am much indebted to my Major of Brigade, Captain Hart, for the able and zealous assist ance he afforded me in his arduous office throughout the operation. I have the greatest pleasure in bearing testimony to the humanity and forbearance of the Troops under my command; not a single instance of wanton cruelty or ill-treatment of the peaceable inhabitants of the town has been brought to my notice..

Sir ,—In my letter of 19th instant (No. 898) I mentioned having had another messenger from Dewan Moolraj, with a note requesting permission to send a confidential Agent to me. In reply I desired his unconditional surrender at 8 a. m . next day, and when I received the answer from Major Edwardes to sign and send, 1 took occasion to notice emphatically to the messenger, that I should confine to the guard any man that brought any documents or message from the Dewan, who were not authorized to the above effect. Nothing transpired regarding it yesterday, and I issued the orders for making the assault at both breaches at daylight this morning. The counterscarp on the city side not having however been blown in as was cal culated upon, I postponed the attack till 6 a. m . to-morrow. However, at 11 a. m . to-day, just as Major Edwardes had called to speak on matters connected with our march hence, the Vakeel who had waited on me on the 9th instant, DiaBux, came under a guard from our pickets, with a letter from the Dewan to each otus, the purport of which was, that lie required assurance of his life, and that the females of his family should not be disgraced, I said in reply, that re^ garding the former lhad only authority to require the Dewan's unconditional submission to the justice of the British Government, and that no stipulation was necessary regarding the latter, for women and children, as a matter of course, would not be molested. Dia Bnx then said his master would certainly come in, and suggested 9 a. m . to-morrow for the time of his doing so, but I could not agree to so late an hour. I told him the fire of all my Batteries would continue until 5 o'clock to-morrow morning, and that the Dewan must at latest present himself and garrison at the Dowlut Gate of the city at sunrise, where arrangements would be ready to facili tate their surrender, and to afford protection to their families. 1 will, in conclusion, venture my opinion that the Dewan is now sincere in his desire to sub mit. His followers are leaving him in large numbers, and our Cavalry took prisoners about 300, who stole from the citadel last night; but if it prove otherwise, I shall have nothing to regret in having attended to a third reference from him, for the sake of humanity, and for the welfare of my troops; and the only difference it will make in my arrangements will be, that the assault on the citadel will commence an hour later, and be equally attended, under Providence, with, 1 trust, complete success, (True Copy.)

This successful termination to our siege operations, after the laborious and gallant exertions ot the Troops since the -J/th ultimo, ^ ill 11 ' doubt be very oratifyinn- to His Lordship and to the Government : and f am grateful to Divine Providence for having permitted in this way the accomplishment ol such an important result. On the 1st instant, with my letter No. 860, 1 had the satisfaction of forwarding Brigadier the Hon'ble H. Dundas's report of the conduct of the Troops of his Division engaged in the attack on the suburbs on the 27th ultimo, of the left column of which he took personal com mand, particularizing many officers in command of corps of Departments, or on the staff, whose services had been valuable ; also on the 7th instant with my letter No. 876 I trans mitted similar reports of the proceedings of the two columns under Brigadiers btalker and Markham, that had taken the city by assault on the 2nd instant, and which will, 1 trust, meet with the favourable consideration of His Lordship, but not having hitherto availed myself of any occasion to notice in just terms of commendation various officers of the Ben- oal Division who have been with me the last six months, I beg permission to doso now. o ■ ' To Brigadier Cheape, C.

The practice of the Artillery was the theme of admiration with all; my thanks are par ticularly due tf) Majors Garbett and Leeson respectively commanding the Artillery of the Bengal and Bombay Division, and to the Officers under them; Major Day, and Brevet Major Blood and Captains Turnbull, Daniell, Anderson, Master, and Mckenzie. Lieute nant Mill, Brigade Major of the Artillery Bengal Division, since July, has been particular!}w [ 287 ] brought to my notice by Major Garbett for his useful services, and as contributing essen tially to the advance of our operations. I must particularly commend those of Captain Hicks, Bombay Artillery, and Lieutenant P. Christie, Bengal Artillery, Commissaries of Ordnance, w ho were unremitting in attention to their important duties. The services of Brigadiers Hervey and Markham, Commanding Infantry Brigades, and of Brigadier Salter, Commanding the Cavalry, as also of their Brigade Majors, Captains Viggeus and Balfour, and Lieutenant Warner, have been very valuable ; and it will be in the recollection of His Lordship that Brigadier Markham had the good fortune, on theTtli November last, and on the 2d instant, to command columns of attack that were eminently successful. Tu my letter of the 7th instant, No. 876, 1 noticed the gallant proposition of Lieut. Colonel Franks, C. B. Commanding Her Majesty's 10th Regiment, for a party being ^riven him to escalade the citadel on the 2d instant, and I am much indebted to this Officer on other accounts. It is also proper for me to notice in terms of commendation, the other Officers Com manding eorps in the Bengal Division, and under canvas the last six months, viz. Lieute nant Colonel Brooke, Her Majesty's 3Jd Regiment, Major Farquharson, Commanding 8th Native Infantry, Major Lloyd, Coinmamiing the 49th Regiment, Major Finnis, Command ing 51st Native Infantry, Captain Jamieson, Commanding 52d Native Infantry, Captain Lloyd, Commanding 72(1 Native Infantry, relieved on 30th November by Lieut.

They both merit my warmest commendation and thanks. 1 have written this despatch in much haste, and fear I have omitted the names ot some to whom i feel much indebted, in which case 1 shall not tail to repair the omission. it is very Satisfactory to me to add in conclusion, that 1 have always experienced Irom Brigadier the llon'ble H.

O The services of Commander Powell, Indian Navy, with the Steamers under his orders, have been of much value to the objects of the expedition, and a detail of seamen from the vessels have afforded material relief at the Batteries on several occasions. 1 have had the greatest satisfaction in directing a royal salute to be fired from the citadel at noon in honor of his Lordship's victory over the Sikhs on the 13th instant, and shall order another to be fired at sunset for the happy termination of Military operations in thi&gt; quarter. v - || ^ Thirty-nine Guns and Mortars taken. r l imr fon in si r W ces[ 289 ] niaiKled by Major Edwardes and Lieutenant Lake, by cutting down the leader of the ! %rr g thstormi '* column of ^ ^ ot rht ^ Mi* _ i (True Copy.)
