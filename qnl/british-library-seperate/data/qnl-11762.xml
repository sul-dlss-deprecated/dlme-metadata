The correspondence, which is mainly between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain, discusses concerns expressed by the Commandant of the Muscat Infantry regarding the supply of officers to the Infantry. With a small number of men available to defend Muscat against possible attack, the Political Agent suggests to the Political Resident that the Muscat Agency and Consulate should offer to dispense with its Infantry guard. Also present as a correspondent is the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman's Minister for Foreign Affairs.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Muscat Regiment</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Embassies and consulates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military Personnel</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00002d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00002d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
