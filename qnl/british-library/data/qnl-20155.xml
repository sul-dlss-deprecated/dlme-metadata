I shall duly report any information on the subject that I may receive from the Political Agent, Koweit. No. 179, dated the 23rd January 1905. From—Captain S. G. Knox , C.I E., Political Agent, Koweit, To—Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward herewith the translation of a letter received from Shaikh Mubarak in which he complains of the arrest of the Bussorah Agent of one of his influential Nejd friends who handles most of Shaikh Mubarak's business. 2. The firm of Ul-Khathair to which Pahad bin Khalid, also mentioned in the letter, belongs is the most wealthy house in Koweit. 3. The news of the arrest of these people had reached me two days before Shaikh Mubarak's letter came, and I bad noted in a draft for my weekly diary that it was repotted that they had been arrested at the instance of Ibn Rashid who is said to have managed to get the orders issued at Constantinople. 4. The explanation of the whole affair according to Koweit opinion is as follows The local Turkish Official, His Excellency the Wall of Bussorah, a friend of Shaikh Mubarak, was making an honest attempt to solve the Nejd affair, in the best interests of his own Government at least, by , coming to terms with Ibn Saood ; as all influential people in Nejd were tired of the constant fighting and anarchy that has prevailed there for the last five years and as Shaikh Mubarak and Ibn Saood were forced to defer to public opinion and give up the hopes of British protection for Ibn Saood His Excellency's efforts promised to be successful. This solution meant nothing less than the extinc tion of Ibn Kashid who directed this last blow at Shaikh Mubarak to destroy all chance of a successful meeting at Sefwan. 5. It is reported here that on receipt of the orders to Imprison the merchants His Excellency telegraphed a remonstrance on the ground that the men were respectable and Influential merchants. He received a reply to say that they must be sent at once to Constantinople. The men start immediately. 6. The Shaikh was, I hear, much disturbed at the news of the arrest of these men and the report is to my mind confirmed by this letter which was brought to me by his confidential Secretary who had evidently received orders to explain the matter to me thoroughly and to do all he could to induce me to take the warmest interest in the case. The tone of the letter is quite different from anv I have hitherto received from the Shaikh. It reads more like an Indian petition than an Arabic letter. 7. I asked Mulla Abdulla whether Shaikh Mubarak would go to Sefwan after all and he said Yes There was a distinct note of fretfulness when he tsaid— t( The great Government is too far away to look after us, W e don t2 know wbat its policy is. Meshed Ali (Nejef) is full of soldiers and the Nejd people are tired of this everlasting fighting. They don't know l:ow to feed and clothe their children. Nothing hut fighting.' He went on to tell me how Shaikh Mubarak hated the Turks and that Ibn Saood's coming had been delayed, but that the latest news was that he was due at Jahra on the 27 th instant and that Nasir bin Saood, the messenger whose arrival here was reported in my diiry under date 18th January, was now in Bussorah. 8. The immediate object of the Shaikh's letter may possibly be attained by the good offices of His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Bussorah, but it is difficult to know what to suggest as a remedy for these constant skilfully disguised attacks aimed at Shaikh Mubarak as a punishment for having sought our pro tection. 9. There remains nothing for me to add except that I saw Shaikh Mubarak on the morning of the 23rd instant. He confirmed all that has been said above without my asking for confirmation except that when I asked if Ibn Saood would go to Sefwan he said that he was not sure, that both Ibn Saood and the people of Aneyza would be greatly alarmed at the turn things had taken and that unless some measures were taken to counteract the latest move of the Turks or rather as he put it of Ibn Rashid and Yusuf bin Brahim, Ibn Saood would return direct to Nejd, the Turkish troops would march from IvejefAli and Nejd would again be plunged into war. He said apparently quite seriously thnt if His Excellency's advice was not taken with regard to local matters of this kind he ought to resign. 10. Incidentally it may be of interest to note that he contrasted the behaviour of the Indian Government who allowed Yusnf-el-Brahim's Bombay house to trade in perfect security in Sfdte of the fact that Yusuf's men had tired on the crew of a British man-of-war, wounding two m^n, and that of the Turkish Government who, on the iiccusation of men like Ibn Bashid and Yusuf-el-Brahim, threw the affairs of an important mercantile firm into confusion. He again impressed upon me the fact that Yusuf-el-Brahim, who, it was arranged, should stay at the Hejjaz, was back in Nejef (Meshed All) in close communicatioa with the Mushir of Baghdad and doins? all the mischiefs he could. 6 Translated purport of a letter, dated 15th Zi-ul-Kada 1322 = 22nd January 1905, from Shaikh Mubarak of Koweit, to Captain S.

The presence of Shaikh of Koweit at mmeting has been made a sine qua non and Mubarak is making preparations to proceed there escorted by a precautionary guard of 1000 men • In conversations with Knox regarding this important event the ShaiHh has morej^ than once impressed upon him what a desirable measure it would be for Nejd and Ibn Saood to be brought under British protection and how e arnestly such a course is wished for both by himself and his ally • If such protection cannot le be accorded Ibn Saood, he says , will have no other course than to admit Turks into Nejd • Concurrently MX with these expressions of opinion ,but independently , Shaikh Mubarak has stated to Knox that he thinks he is entitled to be paid by the British Government for his services • It would seem from the above that the Shaikh of Koweit and Bin Saood are makiing use of the present developments to work upon our feelings , but a discreet and non-committal atti -tude has been maintained by Knox • No doubt at the prospective meeting efforts will be made by tte the Turkish representative to detach Mubarak from us and the latter wilf} will I hope remain staunch , nevertheless the if he knows that while the meeting is in progress a British gun-boat is lying at Koweit , it may be a source of confidencen as well as a deterrent to him .

The Vice-Consal at Kerbala reports as follows about the recent expedition against Ibn Saoud : — ^ A belief has long been entertained here by the public that the four regiments originally sent in support of Ibn Hashid have been entirely annihi lated and that Ibn Eashid has sustained a serious defeat. This belief has been lately confirmed by the report of two privates who escaped from their regi- ment at Jabal and arrived here about ten days ago.'' ' They say that their force experienced great hardship and hunger while en route to and in Jabal, and that a few days after their arrival, the Amir (Ibn Rashid) ordered them to prepare for an attack on the enemy.' ' The Amir placed the Turkish troops and their officers in front and his own men behind, the combined forces then entered Ibn Saoud's territory and without much difficulty or fighting captured four towns compelling Ibn Saoud and his followers to retreat.' ' After that Ibn Rash id received a letter from one Ibn Bassam in Borreida (members of the Bassam family are found in Basra and Syria as large traders) telling him that he had contrived certain plans for the delivery of the place into his hands and asking him to go there with his forces as soon as possible.' ' The Amir was deceived and started for Borreida where he was surprised and attacked by Ibn Saoud. The Amir and his men who were in the rear escaped with about 800 officers and men because they knew the roads, but the others remained fighting and were either killed or captured.' &lt;8 All reports combine in giving an exceedingly pathetic account of the Turks in Ibn Rashid's hands at Jabal: they are said to be severely treated and scantily maintained.'60 'Two officers, a Meer Alai and a Colonel, were killed by the Amir in Jabal because they refused to obey the Amir's orders and make a second invasion after their defeat.' ' The officers here are much incensed against the Amir but dare not express their feelin-s. The Amir has reported the occurrence to Constantinople and fresh troops have been ordered to support him. The new expedition will consist of four regiments of infantry, each about 300 strong : twelve to sixteen ^uns with men and officers forming one regiment and perhaps one regiment of mule riders. These six regiments will be raised from Baghdad, Amara Kerbala, Hillah, and Kerkuk, and Taizi Pasha, the late acting Vali of Baghdad, will be in command.' ' The Government has sanctioned T. £5,000 for the necessary expenses but the late Vali has demanded T. £30,000.' ' The Eeserves which have been mobilised are for the purpose of replac ing the soldiers of Faizi Pasha and these troops are to met at Najef and then follow the route taken by pilgrims to Jabal and Mecca; the transport will be by means of camels which will be supplied by the Amir.' Besides these troops it is said that another force will be sent from Hedjaz, both to meet at Jabal.' 44 It is said that Eaizi Pasha is very unwilling to go and has tried to get off this unexpected call to duty, but has failed to do so; he then asked to be allowed to proceed to Damascus with his troops and from there taking six more regiments proceed to Jabal: this also has been refused.' 'Paizi Pasha is said to have appointed one Fahad, son of Abdul Mihsin, formerly official Sheikh of the Aniza tribe, to accompany him, but on the request of the Amir, who is on bad terms with Eahad, he was dismissed and another man has been appointed.' &lt;c This Fahad is said to be a friend of Ibn Saoud, and he was appointed to the Ohieftanship of the Aniza tribe in order to win him over: what exactly was tbe object is not known.' te rpjjg Turkish officials and many others are looking on these disturbances with the belief that the English are at the bottom of it all.'

The victorious Amir is said to have taken prisoners most of the survivors among the enemy, and to intend placing them under the custody of his ally, the Sheikh of Koweit. The writer expresses the hope that Turkey will not send a further force to perish in the sands of Arabia, and that the Sultan will save the country from British domination by pacific means, that is by recognizing the autonomy of Arabia under his own suzerainty, and under that of the ' three other great Mussulman Powers,' by whom perhaps he may be understood to mean England, Prance, and Russia.

He took it very well and though I watched keenly for any sign of disappointment for irritation, I could not detect anything of the kind. ' He assured me that he was abiding by his promise, which he had not forgotten and confirmed his words when he came to see me this morning, by a letter to your address which he asked me to read. ,, In the letter referred to the Shaikh while freely admitting the fact that Ibn Rashid is his enemy and Ibn Saood his good friend to whom he wishes success, repeats his former promises to abstain from assisting him and maintains that he has steadfastly kept his undertaking hitherto. «.

On the 20tb December the late Valiof Baghdad paid me a long private visit. He is going to command the expedition which is being sent by the Turks into the region known as Karim, and he told me that his total force will consist of about 7,000 men, of whom about half are coming from Medina, some from Yemen, and the rest from the Baghdad Vilayet. If these do not suffice, troops will, he said, be brought from the Vilayet of Adana, He said, that on hearing of this expedition, both Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saoud had written to him to say that they wish to make peace, and would accept the Sultan s authority. He said he did not expect there would be any serious fighting because his force would be too strong for any opposition. When I asked him how he proposed to feed so large a force, he replied in a most easy going way that he supposed they would live on biscuits or tinned foods, but he added that they might occasionally get mutton because there are a good many sheep in that country which, he said, was by no means so barren as generally supposed. He said the place had some perennial streams coming from the Jabal Sbamar and that in the neighbourhood of these there was some, and might be much more, cultivation. Also, he said, there were several wells and oases in the neighbouring desert. He was and has always been most friendly towards me as far as his limited powers and the suspicion of the Turks would allow. He stayed for a long time, and we parted in the most cordial manner. (Sent to Embassy, Constantinople). ****** 22nd December.-—Six hundred Infantry (Redifs or Reserves) left to-day by the Turkish steamer Mosal on their way down the river. It is said that 300 of these men are going to the Muntafik country and 300 to be stationed at Basrah. These troops have recently arrived from Mosul and Kirkook.

They are about gOO in number. It is said that about 40 of them deserted the second day after their departure, because the Government had not supplied them with bedding and clothing in this winter season. Some say that these Reserves are going to join the fight which is now going on between Ibn Saoud and Ibn Bashid, others say that they are going against the Sherif of Mecca, who has disobeyed the Government and destroyed the Hedjaz Railway, and that now the Govern ment will have to overcome the Sherif.

Trevor, LA., for Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of the correspondence ending with your endorsement No. 609 E. B., dated 10th February 1905, regarding events in Neid, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter addressed by His Majesty's Consul at Bussorah to His Maiesty's Charge d'Affaires at Constantinople on the subject. No. 7, dated the 18th February 1905. • From— J. H. Monahan, Esq ., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bussorah, To—His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Constantinople. , With reference to my despatches and telegrams respecting the affairs of Nejd and Koweit, I have the honour to submit the following in complete summary of my information. The Turkish expedition of last summer and autumn in aid of Ibn Rashid into the Kasim District of Nejd seems to have failed entirely. It is com monly said here that not more than 700 Turkish soldiers remain near Hail out of an original expeditionary force of about 2,000, and that there have been not many more in Nejd since the last engagement that near A1 Russ of the 27th September last. There would appear to have been a very heavy- loss from disease and desertion. Out of six guns one was lost, and three more recaptured from Ibn Saood, had it seems been damaged and made useless. A military informant said, early in December, that there were about 4,000 Turkish troops near Hail which would appear to be a monstrous exaggeration to say the least of it. Perhaps some troops came from Medina, but I have no information about that. At any rate, it is certain that the Turkish troops have done nothing since the abovementioned engagement. An apparent result of the failure was the fact that about the end of last October Fakhri Pasha, acting Vali, wrote, under instructions no doubt from Constantinople, a letter to Abdul Rahman Ibn Eaysel, the old father of the person commonly known as Ibn Saood, inviting him to come and settle the affairs of Kasim in a friendly meeting. About the end of November a letter was received from Abdul Rahman by the Vali Mukhlis Pasha. Informants who ought to know state that the letter was in the hand writing of Shaikh Mubarak's Secretary at Koweit which is 300 or 400 miles away from the place where Abdul Rahman was. This is explained by supposing that the letter was sent with all speed from Koweit for signature or that the Shaikh of Koweit had been entrusted with the seal of Abdul Rahman, The letter consisted of professions of loyalty to the Sultan and of requests not to send troops into Kasim because the people of Kasim would have none of Ibn Rashid and there would be bloodshed. About the same time a telegram to the same effect to the palace from Abdul Rahman passed through Bussorah and another to the same effect to the palace from the Kaimakam of Katr Jasim bin Tbani who, though called Kaimakam, would appear to be almost independent and to have become a friend of Ibn Saood and Shaikh Mubarak though he was formerly their enemy. About the middle of November Paik Pasha, Mutessarif of Hasa, was dismissed from his post in consequence perhaps of a telegram to the Vali signed by a Colonel, who has become acting Mutessarif of Hasa, three Majors and the Accountant of Hasa, accusing him of facilitating the despatch of arms and provisions to Ibn Saood, of sheltering his adherents, of exciting Ottoman soldiers and others to disloyalty, and of carrying on a correspondence with Ibn Saood and Mubarak and receiving their emissary. There is, I under stand, no foundation for these charges and they certainly appear not to have been brought home to Faik Pasha. He appears to have proved incapable as an Administrator. He held an enquiry into the case of his predecessorj2 They then fought with Bin Bashid and the soldiers. He then went on to say When Your Excellency sent for me, I came at your orders. I will not have Bin Rashid interfering In Nejd affairs and will fight him if he comes with soldiers. I will not resist the Turkish Govern ment, provided Bin Rashid is kept away from me and my people. You have, however, no right and no interest in our countries and our people hate the soldiers ,, 6« The Wali leaves. His Excellency then went off saying that he must communicate with Constantinople. 7. Second I nterview. On the night of the 14th February, His Excellency returned, with a telegram from Constantinople, to Gishaniya a few miles on the Koweit side of Sefwan, where the two Sheikhs were encamped. 8. T eems of S ettlement. (a) The first point in the telegram was that Bin Rashid was to have nothing to do with Nejd affairs. (b) The second point. The Turkish Government will seize El-Kasim (sic). If this was really the wording of the telegram it is rather curious reading. To this Bin Saood made no objection. (c) The third point. Shaikh Mubarak must be a party to the agree* ment. 8. S heikh Mubarak's O pinion. To the third condition Sheikh Mubarak flatly refused to consent. He told His Excellency that the people of Nejd were a seditious turbulent lot, that he did not stop them having trade relations with his town of Koweit, but that he kept only one man at El-Kasim. He pointed out how the newspapers had been busy with his name, saying that he had been sending English guns, money and provisions to Nejd, which was utterly untrue and that he refused to have anything to do with Nejd politics. As soon as the Conference was over, he would go to Hageyja and Abdur Rahman to Jahra and thence to his own place. Their ways lay apart. Abdur Rahman was his friend and Bin Rashid his enemy, and he* hoped with all his heart that Abdur Rahman would get the better of Bin Rashid. That, as regards the agreement, he hoped that matters w ,uld go well, but that, if they did not, His Excellency must settle the question with Bin Saood. bheikh Mubarak would have nothing to do with it and was not in anv wav responsible, J J 10.

P reliminary. Sheikh Mubarak began by saying that the work was not at all to his taste and that the weather had been very cold and there was no food for the horses and that generally he had come back dissatisfied. 2. F irst M eeting. The first meeting took place on the 6th February. 3. I nterview with S heikh M ubarak. It appears that His Excellency the 'Wali of Bussorah first saw Sheikh Mubarak, and the Sheikh told him that he had come as requested and had brought Abdnr Eahman bin Feysal bin Saood. He added that he had no concern with the affairs of Nejd and must now leave His Excellency to settle matters with Bin Saood. 4. I nterview with B in S aood. Bin Sacod was then summoned and presented his case. He said that he and his friends had petitioned the Ottoman Government against Bin JRashid and his tyranny, but no answer was returned to their petitions. Then they took the law into their own hands and had crushed Bin Eashid. The result was that Bin Eashid returned with soldiers and intercepted all the messengers Bin Sacod was sending to the Sultan, a»d Abdur Eahman bin Saood could get no redress.They then foughfe with Bin Hashid and the soldiers. He then went on to say When Your Excellency sent for me, I came at your orders. I will not have Bin Kashid mterfering in Nejd affairs and will fight him if he comes with soldiers. I will not resist the Turkish Govern ment, provided Bin Rashid is kept away from me and my people. You have, however, no right and no interest in our countries and our people hate the soldiers'* 6.

You are a wise man and your sight is long.4 I shall not omit to inform Government and doubt not that they will receive with approval and gratification the news that you have been guided oy their advice in this matter. With regard to Bahrein you will perhaps have heard of my going there. Two months ago I found that there was disorder in Manama and no security for subjects, and this was due to Sheikh Esa's Government being slack ? and perhaps also to the promptings of bad advisers, and this could not properly be allowed to continue. Now thank God Shaikh Esa has come to realise that Government only wish prosperity to his State and security for all, and that his interests are bound up in preserving concord with the Sarkar. If it interests you Captain Knox will tell you further details of recent events there, and I hope from your wisdom and friendliness that when corre sponding with Sheikh Esa, you will give him profitable advice. a. h C.

In continuation of the correspondence ending with this office letter No. 113, dated ^th March 1905, regarding events in Nejd, I have the honour to forward, • No. 8. dated 24th February 1905. for . the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter * addressed by His Majesty's Consul at Bussorah to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Constanti nople on the subject. No. 8, dated the 24th February 1905. From—J. H. Monahan , Esq., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bussorah, , To—His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Constantinople. With reference to my despatch No. 7 of the 18th instant, respecting affairs of Koweit and Nejd, I have the honour to report further what follows. As to the expedition of last summer and autumn my military informant 32rf3W says that he was mistaken in his statement that last December 4,000 Turkish soldiers were still near Hail. He says that the real number was about 2,400, that the original expedition consisted of exactly that number of infantry, viz., four battalions of 600 men each with six guns ; that only about 300 men were lost and that some reinforcements had probably come from Medina. I give his statements merely for what they may be worth. According to what is generally believed here they are not truthful. The impression here still is that only 600 or 700 men were left near Hail, and nothing appears to be known of re-inforcements from Medina. As to the numbers of the expedition, which is now on its way to or has already reached Kasim (the district of Aneyza, Boreyda, and A1 Russ), I have no precise information, they have perhaps been reported from Baghdad. The following telegram, dated 1st January 190^, was sent by the Mushirat Nejef to the Vali, Bussorah :—' There are 16 battalions now being collected at Nejef : 8 battalions are now being sent on the expedition ; to provide for the needs of these 8 battalions before they move one month's pay is to be given to each battalion according to Imperial Irade of 28th December and special bills or orders for payment are being sent to the Baghdad and Bussorah Vilayets; 100,000 piastres is the share of the Bussorah Vilayet: please draw this amount from the Bussorah treasury and send it by telegraph order.' On the 13th instant the following telegram was sent from the Ministry of Pinance, Constantinople, to the Defterdar (treasurer), Bussorah:—'For four battalions of the 6th Army Corps about to be sent to Kasim deficiencies of one month's pay and provisions amounting to 87,960 piastres. Send of this amount as already ordered the part allotted to the battalions going from Bussorah Vilayet.' I do not clearly understand in this second telegram whether the 87,960 piastres means one month's pay and rations for four battalions and whether any of these four battalions were fresh ones or they had already all been collected at Nejef. I have heard precisely of only two battalions having been sent from Bussorah Vilayet as I have had the honour to report in my telegrams No. 70 of December 31st, 1904, and No. 1 of January 7th, 1905. I have heard vaguely that some troops, perhaps two battalions, were sent from the Muntefik district of the Vilayet, and that there was an extraordinary number of desertions on that occasion. However, it seems clear from the two telegrams that it was intended to send on the expedition at least 8 battalions infantry, and I hear also of 6 guns and about 400 mule cavalry. I have heard that the force or part of it was about a fortnight ago at Wakisah wells about 100 miles on the road from Nejef to Kasim, but I have heard practicallynothing further of its marcli since a part of it left Nejef towards the end of January, parts of it .having, it seems, left earlier. The Vali has now informed me that the expedition is to be a peaceful one and that the Mutesarrif and other officials for Kasim will follow as they have been accepted by Ibn Saood's father, Abdur Eahman, m the two meetings of the 8th and 13th instant, respectively, which I have reported. The Vali says that Abdur Rahman requested of him the favour of an interview complaining that Ibn Rashid was listened to by the Turkish Government, while he himself though loyal had never been heard; that he, the Vali, obtained the necessary permission from Constantinople and the meetings took place accordingly with a satisfactory result. My information, however, of the correctness of which I have no doubt, is that the first overtures came from the Acting Vali Fakhri Pasha at the end of October as I have reported. The unsubmissive telegram from Abdur Rahman reported in my despatch above referred to was not in reply to the letter of Pakhri Pasha. This telegram and the one from the Kaimakam of Katr, reported in the same despatch, were handed into the Fao Office on the November, were kept in Bussorah about a fortnight during which tkne the Vali was no doubt telegraphically corresponding with Constantinople, and were finally sent on to the Palace about the end of November. Abdur Rahman's equally unsubmissive letter, reported in the same despatch, was received here on the 5th or 6th December and may have been in reply to Eakhri Pasha's letter though I have not heard that it contained anything about the proposed meeting. Further correspondence passed with the details of which I am unacquainted, and about the beginning or middle of January a letter was received by the Vali from Shaikh Mubarak of Koweit asking about the proposed meeting of the Shaikh and Abdur Rahman with the Vali. Abdur Rahman came to or near Koweit, and sent a message to the Vali proposing a meeting on the Koweit boundary. The Vali wanted the meeting place to be near the town of Bussorah, but the Shaikh and Abdur Rahman seem to have objected that there was no good pasture near the town for the many horses and camels which they had with them. The two were also no doubt afraid of Arab enemies and Turkish authorities. The telegram of the 21st from the Mushir at Nejef to the Vali here, of the en dWrpart of which I have telegraphed the substance, probably contained something about the meeting. The en clair Arabic part consists of Koranic phrases promising in the Sultan's name pardon for past offences and exhorting Mussalmans to beware of infidels, accept good Government and not fight among themselves. This was put en clair probably, because there is no cypher for such Arabic words. It has not as vet so far as I know been sent to Nejd or Kasim. The Mushir wanted comes nf if fn T ia , uui ae win nave none of Ibn Rashid s some one here that he, the Tali, reproved3 4 Shaikh Mubarak for signing himself 'Euler and Chief', but that the Shaikh would not agree to signing as Kaimakam. The Vali after the first meeting expressed himself to my dragoman in violent language against Mubarak as a ' pig who would not allow the telegraph to Koweit or a postal service to pass through his territory to the south. I have not been able to learn what passed at the second meeting. Imme diately after it the Vali sent to Mubarak a written message, and it, probably from what I hear, contained the written Imperial pardon for Abdur Eahman and his son. The Vali has telegraphed to the Shaikh (addressing him as Kaimakam of Koweit) asking urgently for a reply to letters meaning no doubt to this message which may also have contained something else of importance. I would add. that it does not appear that the Vali gave any decisive answer in the meetings or that there has been any result. 6.1. C. P. O.—No, 6069 F. D.—S4-3.1905.-67—B. B.

Da ; 11 ^ declded an active policy in the Nejd direction, and has ordered that a new and more powerful expedition shall be prepared without loss of time, for the ostensible purpose of assisting Ibn Rashid to crush Ibn Saoud and his Wahabi followers. The ulterior intention is that the expedition shall, when it has achieved its object, permanently occupy all the principal places, both on the coast and in the mtenor of the perunsuia. after removing all the local Chiefs to Constanti- . i,^ e o^podition is to be conducted on a large scale is shown by the fact that Ibrahim Pasha, of the Milli, has been ordered by telegraph to collect and forward to Baghdad 6,000 camels to serve for the transport of the stores and ammunition. Monahan has also informed me by telegram, dated the 29th December 1904, that the Acting Vali of Basrah invited Ibn Saoud to that place in a tnendly letter some two months ago, and that, about a month ago, Ibn Saoud's father sent a telegram to the Sultan (possibly the communication contained in my despatch No. 862-Secret, of the 8th November 1904) professing loyalty, but claiming ownership of Kassim, and deprecating the dispatch of troops, which would cause bloodshed. Mr, Monahan adds that the semi-independent Kaimakam of Katr also sent a telegram in the same sense to the Sultan about the same time, in which15 he said that the people of Jlatr were hostile to Ibn Kashid, and that, if Turkish troops were ^ent, the country would become like Koweit. The Mutessarif of Hassa, Eaik Pasha, was dismissed, Mr. Monahan reports' some five or six weeks ago, on the score, it is said, that he was seDding provisions to Ibn Saoud. It is announced that Nedjib Bey, an ex-Mutessarif of El Bassan, has been appointed to replace him. I have very good reason to believe that it was fully intended, up to a very few days ago, to accept the submission which Ibn Saoud had made by telegram addressed direct to the Sultan, and that instructions were sent to Baghdad and Basrah to the effect that his submission had been accepted, and that the pre parations for the military expedition against him were to be discontinued. I do not know what has caused the Sultan to suddenly change his mind, and it would be no matter for surprise should His Majesty again listen to wiser counsels. Well informed military circles are fully alive to the magnitude of the task to be undertaken, and are well aware of the difficulties to be overcome in dispatching and maintaining a large military force in the inhospitable regions from which the victorious Egyptian expedition had to depart in 1819. The Turkish Government have, moreover, a formidable undertaking before them in the suppression of the revolt in the Yemen, which would appear, from all accounts, to be assuming such alarming proportions that it will tax all their available resources to cope with it. A rumour is current here that Sana'a has fallen into the hands of the rebels, but I have no confirmation of such an event from His Majesty's Vice- Consul at Hodeida, though, as I have had the honour to inform 'Your Lordship in a previous despatch, the capital of the province has for some weeks been out off from communication with the coast. I have, since writing the above, received further information, which con firms the report that the Ottoman Government have decided to send an expe- detion against Ibn Saoud. My informant tells me that it has been represented to the Sultan by the Amir of Mecca that the aggressions of Ibn Saoud are due solely to foreign instigation, and that, unless they are promptly checked, the W ahabi encroachments may even extend as far as Mecca. It is reported that Marshal Eeizi Pasha has been put at the head of the expedition which is to start from Baghdad shortly, if it has not already done so. It is, perhaps, worth noting that in all the communications which reach me about Ibn Saoud, the name of Mubarak-es-Sabah, Sheikh of Koweit, is always associated with that of the Wahabi Chief.

Sir , In continuation of my despatch No. 72, dated the 12th instant, I have th® honour to submit, for your information, the inclosed extract from my diary to the Government of India regarding the projected expedition against Ibn Saoud. I have, &amp;c,, L. S, NEWMAKCH, Major. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Extract from Diafy to Government of India for week ending the iStl November 1904. The Vice-Consul at Kerbala reports as follows about the recent expedition against Ibn Saoud:— A belief has long been entertained here by the public that the four regiments originally sent in support of Ibn Rashid had been entirely annihi lated, and that Ibn Hashid had sustained a serious defeat. The belief has lately been confirmed by the report of two privates who escaped from their regiment at Jabal, and arrived here about ten days ago. They say that their force experienced great hardships and hunger while en route to frndi in. Jabal, and that a few days after their arrival the Amir (Ibn Rashid) ordered them to prepare for an attack on the enemy. The Amir placed the Turkish troops and their officers in front, and his own men behind, the combined forces then entered Ibn Saoud's territory, and, without much difficulty or fighting, captured four towns, compelling Ibn Saoud and his followers to retreat. After that, Ibn Rashid received a letter from one Ibn Barsam in Borreida (members of the Basram family are found in Basrah and Syria as large traders), telling him that he had contrived certain plans for the delivery of the place into his hands, and asking him to go there with his forces as soon as possible. The Amir was deceived, and started for Borreida, where he was surprised and attacked by Ibn Saoud. The Amir and his men, who were in the rear, escaped, with about 300 officers and men, because they knew the roads, but the others remained fighting, and were either killed or captured. All reports combine in giving an exceedingly pathetic account of the Turks in Ibn Rashid's hands at Jabal; they are said to be severely treated and scantily maintained. Two officers—a Mir Alai and a Colonel—were killed by the Amir in Jabal because they refused to obey the Amir's orders, and make a second invasion after their defeat. The officers here are much incensed against the Amir, but dare not express their feelings. The Amir has reported the occurrence to Constantinople, and fresh troops have been ordered to support him. The new expedition will consist of four regiments of infantry, each about 300 strong. Twelve to sixteen guns with men and officers forming one regiment, and perhaps one regiment of mule riders. These six regiments will be raised from Baghdad, Amara, Kerballa, Hilla and Karkook, and Taizee Pasha, the late acting Wali of Baghdad, will be in command. The Government has sanctioned £T.5,000 for the necessary expenses, but the late Wali has demanded ^T.30,000. 4980 f. d.17 The reserves which hare been mobilized are for the purpose of replacing the soldiers. Paizee Pasha and these troops are to meet at Nejef, and then follow the route taken by pilgrims to Jabal and Mecca; the transport will be by means of camels, which will be supplied by the Amir. Besides these troops it is said that another force will be sent from Hedjaz, both to meet at Jabal. It is said that Eaizee Pasha is very unwilling to go, and has tried to get off this unexpected call to duty, but has failed to do so. He then asked to be allowed to proceed to Damascus with his troops, and from there, taking six more regiments, proceed to Jabal; this also has been refused. Faizee Pasha is said to have appointed one Pabad, son of Abdul Mihsim formerly official Sheikh of the Aunaiza tribe, to accompany him, but, on the request of the Amir, who is on bad terms with Eabad, he was dismissed, and another man has been appointed. This Eabad is said to be a friend of Ibn Saoud, and he was re-appointed to the Chieftainship of the Aunaiza tribe in order to win him over ; what exactly was the object is not known. The Turkish officials, and many others, are looking on these disturbances with the belief that the English are at the bottom of it all.

I am even given to understand that Feizi Pasha, who commands the 6th (Baghdad) Army District, will also proceed to Nejd (it indeed he has not already started) on a special mission to the Emir, but you will he better informed on this point from another quarter. Y ou will, Sir, doubtless have heard of the capture of Hail by Abdul Aziz Ibn So'oud, the Wahibi opponent of Ibn Eeshid. A report has reached me to the effr ct that Ibn So'oud has made an earnest appeal to the Sultan to support his claim to the Emirship of the JSejd on the ground that he is the hereditary Emir, and not Ibn Reshid, who can only claim descent from an usurper, viz. his grandfather, Abdullah Ibn Keshid, the founder, so to speak, of the dynasty' This is undoubtedly true, but it is open to question whether the Sultan could, as a matter of policy, even if he wished, cease to protect the present represen tative of the Ibn Eeshid family. In view of the conflict now going on in the Nejd, it has occurred tome that some of the troops now supposed to be on their way to the Y&amp;nen may not improbably be landed at Yamb6 (instead of proceeding to Kumfida or Hodeidah) and marched up through Medina to Hail to the assistance of Ibn Eeshid. Here in military circles it is reported, it is true, that Yemen is the destination of all the troops, but that would be stated in any case. It does not follow that it is true. I have, etc., W, S.

(!•) About a fortnight ago a messenger arrived at Mecca with letters from Bin Saud to the Grand Shereef and the Vali of Hedjaz. It is reported that Bin Saud wrote to the Grand Shereef that as His Highness is the recognized leader of the Arab tribes and their Sheikhs, so he considered it necessary to make him the channel of all correspondence between him and the Sublime Porte or His Imperial Majesty the Sultan. He goes on to say that he has no idea of revolting against the Turkish Government, nor to disobey their orders; and as he is the lawful Euler of Nejd, and he has defeated the usurper, Bin Eashid, he was willing to accept any reasonable terms imposed on him by the Imperial Government and to carry 6074 P. D.6 them out faithfully. He also mentioned in this letter that he was sorry for having fought the Turkish troops in Nejd, hut as_ they were helping his antagonist, Bin Rashid, he waS obliged to do so in self-defence. He promised to return to any person appointed by the Government all the booty, including guns, rifles, belouging to the Turkish troops, taken in battle with Bin Rashid. He also informed the Grand Shereef that at the request of His Highness he has allowed the Bassam family to return to their home (Aneza) with all their property, and that the JBassams will testify to the kind treatment they have received at his hands. It is also reported that telegraphic cor respondence had passed between the authorities at Mecca and Constantinople. The messenger has returned to Nejd three days ago with sealed letters to Bin Saud, both from the Vali and the Grand Shereef, but the contents of these are not known. MOHAMMED HUSSEIN. January 3rd, 1905., (2.) With reference to the last Memorandum on the affairs of Fojd, I have the honour to report that I have come to know from the son of Abdulla Bassam, residing in this town, that though Bin Saud has informed the Grand Shereef that he has allowed the bassam family to return to Aneza, it is not true. My informant has received a letter from Abdulla Bassam from Riad, in which is mentioned that the Bassam family have given up tiie cause of Bin Rashid, and henceforth will be faithful to the cause of Bin Saud; no mention is made in this letter that the family has been permitted to return to their home. My informant considers that the letter was most likely written under pressure from Bin Saood or to gain his favour with the object of getting freedom to return to Aneza. It is believed the Bassams have not yet left Kiad. MOHAMMED HUSSEIN'.

I hear that Abdul Aziz bin Saood has taken eight of the Bessam family from Kassim to Riad and holds them prisoners as a sort of reprisal for the action of the Turks at Basrah in removing three Nejdi merchants to Constantinople. A telegram from Abdur Rahman el Feysal to Agah Pasha of the Imperial Household at Constantinople, dated April 4th, was despatched from Fao on April 17th. i have received a copy of it. After acknowledging the receipt of Agah Pasha's telegram through Kassim Khederi of Basrah, and explaining the reasons of delay in answering it, the message runs ' I am the obedient servant of Our Lord the Great Caliph, God preserve his throne till the day of judgment.

Statements have also been presented by the people of Aneyza, Boreyda and Shaggera. We have been honoured with no reply. And the evil deeds of Ibn Reshid, which neither God nor the Imperial Throne will sanction, increase, and all the people of Nejd and the tribes are disgusted at the violence of Ibn Reshid.

MY humble Petition, to be laid, by the intermediary of the Council of Ministers, before the throne of His Imperial Majesty, our gracious Sovereign, 36 (99FD)owtonlatider bf the faithful, Caliph of tlia Prtphet of Lptd of all the Worlds:— I am one of the faithful semnts of the Shadow of God, whose family from father to son, has lavished its blood and treasure in the glorious service of the Caliphate. I have no thought or aspiration save that of meriting the approbation of my Sovereign. It is for me a most sacred obligation to contribute the Imperial taxes at their due and proper season, and to serve and assist the divinely-aided troops of the Shadow of God. Only the local authorities, with a view to advancing their personal interests, have misrepresen ted this Weak sl^ve to the Caliph, making him appear a traitor and a rebel. Whereas these same authorities, for many years past, have not ceased to seize and misappropriate the produce of my farms and date plantatioils, not even hesitat ing to kill and murder my tenants and collectors, and in order to conceal theif own traitorous conduct in this respect they continue to augment their slander ous accusations against myself. Afe fot the schemes and intentions of Afcdul Afciz-ibn-er-Eashid, they are to overrun the whole of Nejd and Irak. Therefore, to further these aims, he s^fids to Constantinople persons in his service, bearing ' dinars 95 (£ 5. d) and presents, who calumniate those faithful ones who are opposed to his aggressive schemes. These, however, will be one and all known to His Majesty. I, together with Jasim-bin-Thain, Kaimakam and Head Sheikh of Katr e otfeWy represented my submission and obedience in our telegrams of the 28th November (10th December) last. I am submissive to every order and command of the Shadow of God. I neither follow the instigations of any foreigner, nor am I the means of communication with any foreigner. In fact, under the protection of His Imperial Majesty, there is no seditious agent or medium^ of foreigners in all these regions. Ibn Rash id's representatives at the capital naturally strive to provoke the wrath of His Imperial Majesty against me, but His Majesty is the judge. He does not desire to persecute his most faithful servants. If the coming Commission of Inquiry does not establish the truth of my assertions, I once more assure Sis Majesty that I willingly accept the severest penalty that he can impose upon me. Let the Imperial Justice decide. m00089 m Telegram, dated the 24th March 1905. \ Fr0m ~ J - H - M0SAH4H ' Es 9-' His Britamrio Majesty'.

On the 23rd instant, Mr. Monahan telegraphed that a messenger had jnst arrived with a letter from Ibn Saoud's father, asking the Vali to meet him at Safwan, on the Koweit boundary. The Vah, who has telegraphed to Constantinople for permission, will propose another place such as Fao, or somewhere nearer to -Dussorali. Ibn Saoud's father is presumably now in Koweit.

Shortly after the ship was clear of quarantine at Bussorah I called upon the Vali, but he did not return my visit. I called upon the Sheikh of Koweit and was informed by the Political Agent that in probably a week or ten days' time a meeting was to take place at Safwan between the Sheikh, 'Abdur Rahman-bin-Saoud and the Vali of Bussorah to see if they can come to some agreement. The Mnshir of Bagdad is said to be very much averse to going on the expedition against Abdul Aziz bin Rahman, and had only got as far as Nizef (about three days' march from Bagdad) when we were at Koweit. Many of his troops are deserting him. Also there are rumours that he has sent £10,000 to Constantinople to try and buy off the expedition. The Sheikh of Koweit is very desirous of getting Neid under British protection.

With reference to my telegram of to-day, No. 28, I have the honour to report that I have received a copy of a telegram despatched through Basrah, presum ably from Aneyza by Lieutenant-General Sudgi, who is in command of the troops from Medina, dated §5 April to the Palace. After prayers for the Sultan's welfare he states that the troops attached to the V. Army Corps, under his command, joined the Mushir at Jibb (sic) and they marched by the wells of Derah (sic) to Kassim. The Sheikhs were summoned separately and received robes of honour and advice. They submitted with good grace. The country being quiet they entered Boreyda, the chief town of Kassim, and Aneyza without incident. The troops were well received. Saleh bin Muhenna and Abdul Aziz bin Suleymi, Sheikhs who had hastened to meet them, were appointed, the former, Kaimakam of Boreyda and the latter Mudir of Aneyza in reward for their fidelity and obedience. Eloquent prayers were read for the Sultan by the assembled Ulema. The Turkish flag was hoisted on the towers of Boreyda, the Hamidier march played and the troops drawn up inline cried ' long live our Padischah.' Thousands of persons listened submissively with folded hands, tears of joy were shed and a salute was fired. The telegram ends with dithyrambic praises of the Sultan and congratulations on this happy event, anticipatory of future victories and successes due to the pious devotion, clemency and power of his Imperial Majesty. I am informed that the Vali received a letter from the Mushir on the same subject on May 4th. The letter was dated 55S April from Aneyza and stated that the Imperial troops entered Boreyda on the and Aneyza on the April. The substance is the same as that of the telegram to the Palace referred to above. The Mushir asks the Vali to release the prisoners here belonging to Kassim. There is no mention of the Amir /bn Rashid in either of these communica tions, but I am led to believe that he was not present at the entry of the troops into Boreyda and Aneyza and that his abstention from all interference in the affairs of Kassim was made a condition of the graceful submission of the inhabitants.

He hoped to be able to send an expedition from Medina to assist by attack ing Ibn Saud from that side, as previously planned, but it had not yet left Medina. Feizi Pasha has taken seven battalions with him, and these with the four previously sent to assist Ibn Kashid, and which have suffered defeat, prac tically denudes the Baghdad Vilayat of regular troops, as there are also the troops in Katar and Katif to be deducted. The Redif battalions are not of much military value in that crops, and many o£ the battalions have never been formed. Saaun Pasha and the various sections of the Muntifik Arabs are reported to show isigns of restlessness again, and, in connection with this qugstion. I &gt;-T to00090 Confidential.

In another telegram repeated to the head-quarters of the VI Army Corps at Baghdad the Marshal states that the notables of Riad came to his camp near Aneyza and proffered their submission, which was accepted, and prayers were said for the Sultan and thanks expressed by the Chiefs for the benefits they had received. The Marshal states that he has ten battalions with him in Kassim, of which four are at Jeheffa. (?) There appear also to be three battalions at Waksa awaiting transport to Nejef. He has sent Lieutenant-Colonel Mazhar Bey with a guard of 120 men _ and 350 camels under the guidance of the Sheikhs of Jeib (?) to get provisions and forage from Khahe (?) with instructions to proceed as far as Medina for them if none are found at the former place. In conversation with the Vali His Excellency informed me that the people of Kassim were well disposed to the troops and willing to come under adminis trative control, but that they would have nothing to do with Ibn Rashid. He said the latter left the Marshal before his entry into Kassim and returned to Hayil. I am informed that the Amir showed some reluctance to obey the Marshal's orders, but on being confronted with an Irade of the Sultan directing his with drawal he left the troops and departed to Hayil.

March 29th , I have received the following infornation from two different sources and 1 believe it to be correct. The following influential members of the Arab coiamunity at Baghdad were arrested last evening (28th March) by the Vali and sent out of Baghdad. Nobody however knows where they have been sent (I) ohukri Sffendi Aloosi Zada; a teacher at the Haidar- khana Madrassi. This nan is said to have very advanced views both in Political and religious natters. (2J Thabit Effendi Aloosi (a cousin of No.l). He was last year the f^s^-el-i-Baladiya (Head of the Municipality) for Baghdad. A connection of his was married to a late Vali of &gt; Baghdad; either Nanyk Pasha or his innediate predecessor. That a Turk should have married an Arab caused some surprise at the time. (3) Abdul Razak Effendi, a treacher at the Adanyeh School at llauddhaxn.

He has a brother by the name of Haji Salah, also00102® a wealthy merchant. It was Hajl Ahmed's clerk who accompanied the Sheikh of BahreiB's cousin when the latter visited me last week. It is said that the Vali invited the above four sepa rately to his house yesterday evening and when they had all assembled he showed them his order for their arrest, some say they were then and there handcuffed and about midnight seat out of town* They are evidently political suspects and it may be they are connected with 'The Arabian Movement H (vide the London letter in the Times of India for the week ending 15th February 1905) which is said to be in progress in Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine. Some 30 members of the Hillif Secret Society of Kar- bala, who have been imprisoned here for the last two years, were also deported to Mosul yesterday. It is said they have been sent there to be tried. Another reason given for deporting the two Aloosi 2adas and Abdul Razak Effendi is that they have written a book in praise of the V /ahabi religion. This book was sent to Egypt to be printed and the cost of printing it was financed by Haji Ahmed ibn 31 Assafi. It is also said that these four individuals will not be allowed to live in future in any Arabian town of the Ottoman00103 Ottoman Smpire, Another reason given for this deportation is that they have been corresponding with Ibn 3aoud and the Sheikh of Koweit and that the Police, on paying a surprise visit t their houses, discovered some incriminating documents.

The Turkish steamer 'Mosul' left Baghdad this morning with the following troops for Hasariyah:- Two hundred infantry (Redifs) under the command of Reshid Effendi. (They had arrived from Arbil ahout a month ago). Twenty artillerymen with one mountain gun. Troops are also 'being sent from Diwaniah and Samawato Uasariyah. I 'believe the foregoing information to be correct. It is said that Sadoon of the Tluntafik who had a quarrel last year with Sheikh Ilehdi of the Ila^dan, lately invited the latter Sheikh to his tent on the plea that he wished to X ma^e peace with him. Sheikh Ilehdi accepted the invitation and was very well received 'by Sadoon. Subsequently Sadoon asked ?!ehdi to get his three sons and brother to join him at Sadoon^s camp as he fSadoon) was desirous of making p^eace with then as well. Sheikh Ilehdi induced his three sons and brother to accept Sadoon's invitation, TThen they arrived Sheikh Sadoon treated them hospitably and the day was spent in great rejoicing. At night Sadoon ordered his negro slaves !.£to murder^five of then in their tent and this was done. The widows of the murdered Sheikhs complained to Hamid Pasha (the Mutasarif of lasariyah) who reported the matter to Baghdad. Baghdad telegraphed to Constantinople, and has now received orders to send troops against Sadoon. It is said that Sadoon has since made two night attacks on Hasariyah. The shops and bazaars at ITasariyah are report ed to he closed and the greatest confusion is said to prevail among the inhabitants. (Sent to Embassy, Constantinople). April 15th . I received the following information on the 14th April 1905:- 'It is said that Faizi Pasha has sent back another regi ment to He^ef as he thinks he has more troops than are neces sary for the expedition.' 'He also sent to He^ef a detachment of 12 men under a lieutenant to replenish his treasure chest. Kavass Iluhammad Dervish 1 s brother, the Sergeant, was one of the detachment. On nearing Nejef the Sergeant's camel went lame and he was unable to keep up with the others. About an hour's distance from Hejef he was attacked by several ^rabs, severely v/ounded, and stripped of all he had. He is at present at the military hospital at Baghdad and is doing well'.

There should still be 10 battalions in Kassim. From advices received at the Head-quarters of the VI Army Corps at Baghdad they appear to be in great straits from want of money and supplies.

Serious fighting is expected in the Nejef district, where a quarrel about some land near Kufa, near the north-east extremity of the lake, has already led to bloodshed between the local tribes and the Khaaall Arabs. Three persons have been killed and two wounded. Other tribes are taking sides'^lj the quarrel, and the affair may become serious.

His claim to BuMyan is much stronger, while TWKsh claims and de facto position there are much weaker. Moreover there is substantial geographical distinction between the mainland where the Turks have long been in the neighbourhood, and the island where they are not known erlr to hive been at all. I would urge that the matter be not allowed to rest and that the Turks should either be required to withdraw their troops and destroy their post on Bubiyan and to reeogmse tbisas au integral portion of the Sheikh's possession, or that he should be allowed to erect a post on the island as proposed by us. His claims to Um Kasr might be utilised to secure this result. If the present position continues much longer after matter has been prominently brought to notice during my tour to the Gulf it will hereafter be almost impossible to assert the claims of the Sheikh to the island, on which our rieht to be consulted in any railway scheme affecting Khor Abdulla could most easily be based.

S ir, 1 transmit to your Excellency herewith copy of a letter from the India Oflice, forwarding a despatch from the Government of India on the subiect of the occupation by Turkish miHtary posts of certain positions on the waterway ot the Khor Abdulla which are considered to be of great importance in connec- tion with prolongation of the projected Baghdad Railway to the Persian Gulf, and of the claims of , the Sheikh of Koweit to the districts in which they are situated. £ The Government of India do not propose to contest the Turkish occupation ot Um Kasr on the mainland, to which, in their opinion, the claims of the Sheikh are not strong ; but your Excellency will observe that in the final para graph of the despatch it is suggested that His Majesty's Government will take such measures as will procure the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Bubiyan Island with the object of establishing and maintaining posts there on behalf of the Sheikh. The proposal is substantially similar to that in regard to which your Excellency in 1902 expressed an adverse opinion* The grounds on which that opinion was formed are given in your telegram No. 30 of March 11th, 1902, in the 4th paragraph of which you state : D ' The Ottoman Government will, I am sure, refuse to evacuate Bubiyan for any reasons we can at present prefer, and to meet with a rebuff would be unpleasant, while to be obliged to drive them out would be equally so. 'Tbe Government of India urge tliat at the time when this opinion was ^iven, the strategic importance of a military post at the northern end of Bubiyan Island had not been fully realised. It may, on the other hand, be argued that at the present moment the forcible ejection of Turkish force from a post on the Coast of the Persian Gulf would be even more inopportune and inconvenient than in 1902, Before further discussing the question, I should wish to learn whether your Excellency has any ground for anticipating that the attitude oi the Turkish Government would be more compliant in present circumstances than you anticipated at the time when your telegram above quoted was written.

Secret, of the 4th February last, a copy of which your Lordship did me the honour of enclosing in your despatch No. 107 of the 22nd March, while asking me at the same time to state whether I had any reason for thinking that the attitude of the Turkish Government would be more compliant in present circumstances than in 1902. While desirous to give all due weight to the views of the Government of India, which are based on the intimate knowledge of the local situation of affairs acquired by the Viceroy of India during his late visit to the Khor Abduila, 1 have no hesitation in saying that the Ottoman Government will resent now, quite as much as in 1902, any claim advanced by His Majesty's Government to Bubiyan Island being the property of the Sheikh of Koweit. I do not consider, however, in face of the knowledge which we have since acquired as to the strategic and general importance of the position, that this need deter us from upholding a claim which I carefully reserved in my language to the Minister for Foreign Affairs reported to your Lordship in my despatch No. 153 of April 1st, 1902. 1 see no serious objection to recurring to the subject and reminding the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the reservations I made in 1902 with regard to Bubiyan as well as to Umasr, but as I then based my remarks on the main tenance of the status quo, of which the occupation of these places was a violation, it would be difficult to use the status quo argument, if the Govern ment of India intend to occupy a port on the northern end of the island on behalf of Sheikh Mubarek. I can, however, urge the Porte not to lose sight of my previous remarks, and complain of the continued maintenance of a Turkish military station on the south-east corner of the island, and press for its withdrawal. If after the lapse of some months, it is found that my re presentations have produced no effect, I would then propose to adopt the alternative course suggested in the Government of India's despatch by stating to the Porte that, unless the Turkish force is withdrawn, we shall be con strained to support the Sheikh in establishing a post on the island. The fact that the number of Turkish soldiers stationed at the south-east corner has gradually been reduced in the course of two years from twenty to six, rather 200129 « [Received on IGth May with Political Secretary's letter No. 18, dated 29th April 1904.] KOWEIT.

In reply I am to invite Lord Lansdowne s attention to the telegraphic correspondence with the Viceroy on the subject, noted in the margin. The Viceroy points out that if the occupation by the Turks of Bubiyan Island, which he reports is being regularly maintained by relieis from the fort at Fao, is permitted to continue unquestioned. It will be almost impossible 8hereafter to assert the claims of the Sheikh, and he therefore urges that, either the Turks should be required to withdraw their troops and recognise the island as an integral part of the Sheikh's possessions, or that the Sheikh should be allowed to establish a post on the island himself. Mr. Brodrick agrees with the Viceroy as to the practical consequences of leaving the Turkish occupation of the island unquestioned, and he is of opinion that it would be desirable to address to them such a communication as is suggested in Sir N.

I said there was no danger of the Shiekh of Koweit preferring unreasonable claims, and still less of their being supported by His Majesty's Government if lie attempted to do so, but I considered his claim to Bubiyan was fully justified, and it seemed an undoubted fact that his supremacy and authority in Bubiyan,* which was annually occupied by one of the Koweit tribes, had not been ques tioned till the Ottoman Government had sent a military detachment there in 1902. The island was probably of little or no importance pecuniarily, but a denial of His Highness authority and rights would be a serious blow to his prestige and influence in Koweit itself, and His Majesty's Government, who had done so much to prevent his interference in the internecine troubles of those parts, were bound to see that he did not suffer in consequence of their advice and protection. The Minister did not pursue the conversation, and it ended by his saying that he would submit the question in the proper quarter. In replying to the Minister, I evaded as far as possible entering into a discussion as to the Sheikh of Koweit's rights to Bubiyan Island, for reasons which I venture to think will be obvious to Your Lordship on referring to para- t Proceeding No. 200, Secret e ., March 1904, graph 5 of the Government of India's Nos.2 00.201.

To Thk Right Hon'ble St. JOHN BROUPJCK, Mis Maj Fort William, Sir, f | haVe t 1 '® Il , ono,lr 1 torefe'-tooiir despatch No. 25 (Seeret-ExternaU 0 -t. -February 1904, and to the subsequent telegraphic correspondence ending with your telegram of 18th May 1905, on the subject of the measures that should he taken to obtain the evacuation of Bubiyan Island by the Turkish troops which are at present stationed there. 2. In that despatch we submitted, for your consideration, the following alternative proposals :— 5 {a) That the Porte should be informed that we were unable to recognise their right to maintain a station on Bubiyan, and should be requested to with- draw their troops; while at the same time we should establish a post on behalf ot Sheikh Mubarak on the northern end of the island opposite to the southern anchor?ige. We pointed out that he had several boats, and could easily, with small support from us, pie vent Turkish troops from crossing the Khor Subbiyeh or chatmei between Bubi^an and the mainland on the west. (b) Should His Majesty's Government deem it advisable to spare the Sultan's susceptibilities by the adoption of a less pronounced course of action, we suggested that our object might be secured by intimating that we regarded Bubiyan Island as belonging to the Sheikh, and that, unless the Turkish force were withdrawn, we should be constrained to support him in establishing a post on the northern shore to balance the Turkish posts at Um Kasr and Al Geit. We observed that in this case the Turks would probably retire, and the island would remain unoccupied. The Sheikh would then resume possession, and it would only remain for us to carry out hereafter such further measures as might be necessary for the maintenauce of our legitimate interests. 3. Since then, the following action has been taken :— In April 1904, His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople suggested to the Marquess of Lansdowne that he should first remind the Porte of his pre vious remonstrances against the maintenance of a Turkish military station on the south-east corner of the inland and press for its withdrawal, and that then, if, after a lapse of some mouths, his representations had produced no effect, the secoud alternative intimation referred to above should be made to the Turkish Government. On 10th May, Sir N. O'Conor was authorised to take action in accordance with his own suggestion, and on 18th May we were informed that, should the intimation remain for some time without effect, the active measures recom mended in our despatch to you of 4th .February would be considered further.2 On 16th May, Sir N. O'Conor reported to Lord Lansdowne the representa tions which he had made to the Porte. His Excellency carried out his inten- tion of reminding the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the • remarks which he had made in 1902 5 in regard to the establishment of Turkish military posts at TJm Kasr and BnMyan Island, hut did not, it appears, avail himself of the authorisation which had been given him for making the alternative inti mation originally suggested by us, and practically confined himself to saymg that he trusted* that the Turkish Government would see the propriety of causing the Turkish soldiers to be withdrawn, and would save him from the ' unpleasant duty of returning to the subject in a more unpleasant form' , as he would be obliged to do unless the matter were arranged within a short time. 4. Since then no further representation appears to have been made to the Porte until 3rd November, when His Majesty's Charg6 d'Affaires pointed out that the continued maintenance of the post was looked upon by His Majesty's Government as an infringement of the status quo, and that the written protest made by His Majesty's Embassy still remained unanswered. Reference may ai&amp;o be made to the fact that, on 30th December, you informed Lord Axnpthill that His Maiesty's Government were unable to accept his suggestion that the removal of the Political Agent at Koweit should be made conditional on the removal of the Turkish post on Bubiyan Island. 5. Nothing has, however, happened since the date of their original recom mendation to induce the Government of India to depart from their contention as to the importance of obtaining by some means the removal of the Turkish troops. 6. In our previous despatch on the subject we have already furnished you with a full statement of the reasons which have led us to adopt this view; and we need not now do more than point out that the Turkish troops meanwhile remain in the island; that it is evident that the remonstrances made have not been treated with sufficient seriousness by the Turkish Government, who, with the continued postponement of the withdrawal of their troops, are in some degree increasing their presumptive right of dominion over Bubiyan in the eyes of the world in general; and that consequently every additional day of inaction will render it more difficult for His Majesty's Government to insist ultimately on evacuation. 7. In these circumstances, we have the honour to enquire whether His Majesty's Government do not consider that the time has now come when His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople might with advantage be provided with definite instructions to make to the Porte the intimation which was authorised in May last, and also whether they will not agree to take into their immediate consideration the advisability of adopting the alternative local measures recommended by us in February 1904, which we still consider to be of urgent importance for the proper protection of British interests in the Persian We have the honour to be, S ir, Your most obedient, humble servants, CUP^ON.

Mr. Monahan has now reported that in a conversation which he had with the Vali on the 23rd instant, the latter said to him that of course the general status quo in Koweit would be respected if such was the decision of the Government but the relations between the Sheikh and the Vali must be changed. The Sheikh did not pay attention to any request and the Vali could get back deserters and criminals from Persia but not from Koweit, His Excellency admitted that guch cases had not occurred lately, but he said the principle was important and cases of that nature might occur. Mr. Monahan then went on to say that natives of Bahrein had applied to him for protection against robbers. The Vali merely replied that the new Mutessarif was in Hasa and that he would do what was necessary.

G. dj' S.The Right Hon'ble St. John Brodrick, Hi. Majsgty* e Secretary e f state for India. Port William, the 4th February 1904 Sir, In hie Secret despatch No. 196, dated the 17th December, His Excellency the Viceroy briefly mentioned his recent visit to Koweit and the Khor Abdulla, and the prospect of the shores of this waterway as a future possible railway ' terminus. ¥e now have the honour to address you in greater detail on the aulDject. 2 * It wil1 130 within the recollecticn of His Majesty*s Government that early in 1902 it was reported that the Turks had established a post at the head of the Khor Abdulla. The Commander of H. M. S« * Sphinx % who was sent to enquire into the matter, visited the locality 'between the 14th and the 19th of February, and reported that, in addition to a position whichwhich they had occupied at Urn Kaar, the Turks had, fer the first time ahout a fortnight preriously, stationed a force of some 20 men on the south-east corner of Buhiyan island. This unwarranted encroachment was at once 'brought to the notice of your predecessor reference was made t© the Importance of the position^ seized, and it was proposed 'by the Viceroy that the Turks should 'be told that they must at once leave Bubiyan, even if no protest were offered against the occupation of Uin Kg/^r# On the 26th March, Lord George Hamilton telegraphed that it was considered inadvisable to raise irritating discussions ahout the movements of Turkish troops t© places to which the Sheikh's title would he difficult to prove, and it was explained that His Majesty's Government did net wish to oh struct the prolongation of the Baghdad Railway to to the Gulf, whether at Koweit er elsewhere^ It was added, however, that their assistance would 'be conditional upon British capital receiving, in respect of construction, materials, and management, at least equal shares with any other Power. In the event, n® action was taken to assert the Chief * » claims 'beyond an intimation to the Porte that their action was regarded as con stituting a disturbance of the statu8_g up, and that the occupatioi ©f the places in question could not he regarded as ia any way prejudicing the Sheikh's righti and authority over them, and th« Turkish po 8 t. Btill rmain at Urn K^r and A1 G.it, W h.r« th.y were th«n ostatlishod.00142 3. Th« importance ©f the question lies in its relation t© the future probabl® terminus of what is known as the Baghdad Railway® Article 1 of the C©nventi©n t dated the 21st January 1902 &gt; between the Turkish Government and the promoters ©f this enterprise provides that the projected railway shall run from Zoheir t© a p©int ©n the Persian Gulf t© he determined 'by mutual agreement 'between the Otteman P©tte and the Cempany, and there appears t© he n© doubt that the Turkish advance ©f 1902 to the shores of Kh©r Ahdulla and the island ©f Bubiyan was designed to enable the concessionaires to secure, without refer ence t© His Majesty's Government, what was already recognised by the German Engineers, and has since been generally acknowledg -ed to be, the most suitable terminus on the Gulf# The first section of the line is now, we understand, in course ©f construe tion by German enterprise unaided, and no arrangements have been made, so far as we are aware, in respect ©f any p©rtion of the r railway from Konia t© th© Persian Gulf f©r securing the con dition whereby His Majesty's Government contemplated that •quality of treatment should be secured f©r British capital. 4 # During his recent t©ur in the Gulf the Viceroy person s- ally visited the Kh©r Abdulla in c©mpany with the Hfval Com mander-in-Chief ©n the East Indies Station, and the result of the inspection was to confirm the view which we previously antartainad of th. Importanco of the Khor and of tho auporioritv(g) 0ri43 superiority of ita shoros, for th« purpose of a railway terminus, over any of the sites in the immediate neighbourhood ef Koweit which have previously claimed attention. On hoard the w Lawrence y n Their Excellencies passed up the channel te the anchorage helow the junction of Kher Zobeir with Khor Ifei KAar, and except at the a eastern end of Warha Island, where, there is 'bar with a depth of two fathoms for a short distance, a depth of four and-a-half fathoms was obtained throughout. The anchorage is some three miles from Um Kjs^r post, and the 'banks ef the channel are sufficiently high to provide a firm and convenient landing place. To the south of the Warba Island lies the large sheet of water with plenty of depth and room for an anchorage, to which Rear- Admiral Willes refers in paragraph 50 ef his letter He.209-1171, dated 8th December 1903, to the Secretary to the Admiralty, of -i which we enclose a copy t Owing to the length of the channel and its capacity for easy land or submarine defences, a port in either of these localities would be absolutely safe from any attack from the seaward. We have already intimated in our Secret despatch No.16 dated ths ZUt January 1904, that th« rsmarks of the UaTal- CoEiinandor- in-Chief in paragraph 51 ef thi. letter were written under a miaappreheneion, and do not accurately repre 8 ent the political position. It is not necessary here, therefore, to00144 to taks th«m into account. In our Socrot do«patoh No. 27 (Prontior), datad tho 4th Fobruary 1904, we haT. mentionod the orobabl. antago- ni8m 0f G,rman lnt0r ' t « to our own in tht. quart.r and tho attitude which, la our opinion, .hould be adopted towards the designs of ether nations in Turkish Arabia, and we consider that no time should he lest in endeavouring te retrieve so far as may still be possible the position which we have so seriously endangered 'by acquiescence in these encroachments. So far as concerns Um Kji^r and the'neighbouring mainland, the claims of -Wit the Sheilch of Koweit do not appear to have been strong. But whatever may have been their validity, it would be difficult and we would not now propose to tryj to induce the Turks to abandon the occupation which for the past year they have been permitted to maintain. The case of Bubiyan Island we regard as entirely different. Here we consider that the Sheikh has claims which can be sustained alike with better reason, with greater prospect ©f success, and, owing to its insular position, with smaller risk of subsequent embarrassment to ourselves. N©. 42 f dated the 28th February 19$2. I In February (Copy sent under cover of the Foreign Secretary's ! letter Ho • 12 M., dated the 20th Marc h 19 02. \ 1902, ©ur Political Resideat 'in the Persian Gulf reported that Sheikh Mubarak had addressed t© him a written communication in which h© advanced his claim to the island, and asserted that the Avazem tribe, who are his subjects, had lived there sincef 0 145 sinca the occupation of Kowait for oovan montho during tho ■wnmor of each year, and had egtabli.hed flehing enclosures on 41 the Island. Colonel Keraball regarded the pretansion as yalid, and a like view appears to haye heen held hy His Britannic Majes^ ty's Ambassador at Constantinople, who a few days later tel^grapl ^Sir W— l M_ycsnnerTe the ffarquess to the Maraueaa of Lansdowne, Ho.33, dated the 16th March q 0f Lansdowne that the Consul at BasrahTconsidered the Sheikh's clain to the island to he good.

With the shores of the mainland and of Bubijran Island in the possession of a single Power, the anchorageobelow Um K^r and at Warba Island can at any time be converted into an impregnable harbour: and even if the day is still distant when the banks of the Kher Abdulla are likely to be armed with foreigr forts or batteries, the undivided occupation by a German Railway Company of a potentially invulnerable position is not calculated to conduce to th% enhancement either of British commercial prosperity or of British political prestige. Supposing, however, that we are able to make good Sheikh Mubarak's claims, we at once place ourselves in a position to establish, at the north enc) r j f ri46 end of Bubiyan Island, a post which would command not only the anchorage hut also the approaches up the Kh©» Abdulla, and we acquirs the power to assert in such a manner as our permanent interests demand, our right to participate in all arrangements relatiTe to the prospectiye terminus of the Anatolian Railway. An additional argument, if any is needed, in favour of strengthening our position at Bubiyan may, perhaps, he found in the fact that the Khor is used as a pla&lt;^ of refuge hy pirates whom the Turkish Government is unahle to control and who, as shown in the Administration Report of the Persian Gulf for 1902-03, commit piracies off Bubiyan. His Majesty*i Government have never admitted the Turkish claim to the island, and have, indeed, protested against the interference with the status q ug. involved in the placing of a post at A1 Geit, where, prior to the month of February 1902, the Turks had never pretended to exercise an authority even ef the most shadowy description, and where the total garrison now consists of some 6 men. On the same occasion we were informed 'by Lord George Hamilton that the ^f#ltgram •f Sik April l^oTpritish Government would resist a Turkish Td^n^e'olPthe Koweit side of Subhiyeh. This place is separated only hy a channel from the southern end of Bubiyan Island: and the claims of the Sheikh to hoth posi- tions seem to us t© 'be of equal validity. The proposal accordingly which we submit forGC147 r consideration Is that th« Port* should now bo Informod that wo aro unahX, to r oco g ni.. thoir ri^t to maintain a Buiiyan, and ohould bo roquoatod to withdraw thoir troop.; whil. at tho aa.0 ti.o wo ^ould o.tabli.h a post on bohalf of Shoikh Mubarak on tho northorn ond of tho i.Xand opposito to tho southern anchorago. Tho Shoikh has always urgod his claims to this island, and during tho Vieoroy's visit to Kowoit ho ropoatodly aakod why tho Turks woro not compollod to avacuata both Bubiyan and Um K^)r which bolongad to him. Ho has savoral boats, and could oasily with small support from us provont Turkish troops from crossing tho Khor Subbiyok or channel botwoon Bubiyan and tho mainland on tho Wast. Should His Majesty's (JoTornmant deem it advisable to spare the Sultan's susceptibilities by the adoption of a less pronounced course of action, wo think it possible that our object might be secured by intimating that we regard Bubiyan Island as belonging to tho Sheikh, and that, unless tho Turkish forca is withdrawn, we shall 'be constrained t© support him in establishing a post on the northern shore to 'balance the Turkish posts at Um and A1 Geit. In this case the Turks would prohahly retire, and tho island would remain unoccupied* The Sheikh would then resume possession, and it would only- remain for us to carry out hereafter such further measures as might 'b® necessary for the maintenance of ourrihi.

Gradually his' appointment will be regarded by the Turks as a fait accompli, and their refusal to withdraw their soldiers from Bubian Island will enable His Maj esty s Government to consider whether at some future date it may not be advisable to check the Ottoman Government by establishing a Koweit military station on Bubian Island.
