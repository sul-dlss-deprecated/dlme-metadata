The considerable increase in civil suits is attributable to % trade difficulties as a result of the unstaple conditions follow ing the Great v.'ar.and to the fact that the advantages of taking proceedings in Court which are permanently recorded,and of obtain • ing deoree.os which can be legally enforced,is becoming increasing-No .7ol of 1922.
