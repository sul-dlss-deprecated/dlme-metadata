Shaikh Sultan bin Salim His richness was illuminating about Shaikh Sultan bin Selim. He is absolutely convinced that, though a renutably wild individual, be will keep a promise. He cb d, for example keen his promise to behave while in exile. He is sure he will not misbehave now. ^lis Highness also said that he actually pays Shaikh Salim for 5 as-arts to maintain order'in the neipobou~h od ox .‘/adi al ^ant. This has nothing to do vth the to 1 ?ate, t^ou^h it is near there (he didn’t think in exactly the same place). He has had a tower built for the Askars which he (the Sultan) has paid ^or. This money is not enough for Shaikh Salim to live on. He is not himself interested in getting Shaikh Salim tc move t ! 'e toll gate, but he things if the Political Resident would like to yet it removed and at t^e same time secure some hold over Shaikh Sa]im he should arrange for a suitable allow ance to he paid to Shaikh Salim from his old shaikh- do™. /hen he was Shaikh he presumably raid his relatives allowances, and no- they should pay He f«e s quite sure some srch arrangement would found efficacious.(Z'iz) (Sj) m Confidential.

Para 7 (c) I consider that the time has come when our policy of non-intervention must be^evised. The Has al Khaimhh and Dubai*Abu Dhabi dispates are per te rfes * of things' to come, and in.my opinion, the.root cause oT each is .a ' r desire by the various partiesr.ato naxe sure of their fair share, or more than the.ir fair share, of the potential oil wealth of the Trucial Coast. ' To minimise the danger^ of such disputes in future^ which / willwill become far more acute when the actual oilfield sites . have been located it seems to me essential that Government should now # (a) start at once on the complex .problem of delimiting the boundaries between the various sheikhdoms* v (b) negotiate new treaties with the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast which will give us legal authority to intervene in inter-tribal disputes/when these threaten the peace, and hence the safety and efficiency of the Oil Company, Airways etc., - • &gt; (c) establish an armed force on the lines of the Makran Levy Corps, under the P.O.r.C. so that he can &gt; « not only give decisions but can if necessary compel them td be carried out. . ' - If Government steps in firmly now on the, lines suggested in the previous paragraph I am confident that the Trucial Coast Shaikhs would welcome such intervention. If we procrastinate for another three years we shall ^find ourselves still compelled to intervene, but in the face of determined opposition on the part of the Shaikhs who by Ifill then^I think/have acquired an inflated idea of their own power and importance. - ( ihe money for the proposed Levy Corps might perhaps be raised by making a percentage levy on the oil royalties paid to the. respective rulers. rhis could be deducted . ^ ao source as income tax. / As regards the immediate problem of Has al Khaimah P.O.T.C. informed the He.sidency Agent befote leaving Sharjah that he would probably be, returning on Sunday the ! ,th October. j suggest that this arrangemenit be confirmed by telegraph to Residency Agent and that he be asked to i^arn .the paroios concamsd to com© to s©s P.O.T C at Sharjah on Monday the 7th.

Shaikh Sultan adamant in refusing to allow his brother and Nephews to live in Ras al Khaimah and prepared to expel them forcibly if necessary. Shaikh Muhammed bin Salim is equally determined to resist effort to expel himself and his sons. 2. Situation is quiet at present as both sides are waiting to see what action Government are prepared to take ^ if any. Only Shaikh Muhammed bin Salim has asked for . ^ Government help. 3. Mediation by Shaikh of Sharjah who is closely related to both parties and Shaikh of Ajman has failed utterly and I do not consider any further mediation by tribal methods would be of any use. 4. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim reiterated that his Nephews have plotted to murder him. Shaikh Sultan^ fear would appear exaggerated and in any case does not justify recent action or his proposed expulsion of his brother and Nephews. 5. Shaikh of Sharjah who has made persistent efforts to bring about a settlement without turning to Government has informed me now that only by Government intervention can bloodshed be avoided. 6 . I feel this is a case in which we may have to intervene (a) in the interest of justice (b) general security. Whatever policy is decided on, our clear declaration of that policy is now necessary. 7. Have promised nothing but have asked Shaikh Sultan (a) to try and find another solution than xekx resort to force (b) to take no action until I see him again next week.

Dated the 30th September, 1946 To Confidential. BAHRAIN^; -JCEIPT. The Political Agent Bahrain. A A L V I d ,t. Sf* M, j; Note on Ras al Khaimah affairs As reported in my telegram No. 1004 of 27th September, 1946, I h^ld discusslpnswith Shaikh Sultan bin Talim and Shaikh Mohammed bin ■TuTXfcfr separately, at Sharjah on the 25th and 26th September. There were two meetings with both Shaikhs, Shaikh Sultan seeing me first on each occasion. I also saw Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah, Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid of Ajman, and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed of Kalba at the Agency. These three Shaikh have been mediating in the dispute. 2. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Ras al Khaimah told me his side of the story, why he had taken action against his brother and Nephews ect., and what his proposed future action was. He related a number of accusations against his Nephews viz:- (1) That they had fired at a British Subject Major Holmes about 10 years ago. x (2) That tney had beaten local Merchants. (3) That they had plotted to murder him at the end of Ramadhan. Apart from No.(3) the accusations Shaikh Sultan made were most unconvincing, and when I asked him why he had not taken action himself for the alleged of/'ences, informed Political Officer, Trucial Coast, he said that he . had done nothing as he wanted peace and did not like to make a fuss. v Sultan stated that on the day before the Id celebrations he was'informed.by the Amir of Shamal that the sons of Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim had approached the- Amir asking him to help in recruiting men for a coup d’etat to overthrow Shaikh Sultan. On hearing this Shaikh Sultan manned the town of Ras Al Khaimah and Muareedh village and stopped all persons entering from the gardens. This was on the first day of Id. (I would mention here that the majority of the Ras al Khaimah population were out in the gardens as is their custom at this time of the year). on entry the next day, but had not and would not allow any member of his brother’s family to enter Muareedh or Ras al Khaimah, as he was firmly convinced that his Nephews were trying to murder him. He mentioned that he had nothing against his brother Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim, but that it was his Nephews whom he really suspected. plot against him, but he had none, and the information the Amir of Shamal gave him appears to be the only reason for provoking him to action. He stated very definitely that he would'not consider his brother or Nephews ever living in Ras al Khaimah again, as he would never be safe; he then quoted as a parallel how the Regent of Kalba had been expelled As regards the alleged plot to murder him Shaikh Shaikh Sultan then stated that he lifste' the ban I asked him if he had any further proof of the from2 from Sharjah and he'said that similar action should be taken against his brother and nephews, and that he was prepared to do this forcibly ik necessary. On this note he left, as I did not wish to say anything until I had seen Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim. 3. I then held an interview with Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim who was accompanied by his two sons Humaid and Chaid. He related much the same history of events as regards the ban on their entry on the day of Id as was told mt by Shaikh Sultan. He then went on to say that he could not understand his brother’s attitude 7 that he had always been friendly with him, that they were one family and closely intermarried. He strongly denied # the accusation that his sons had plotted to murder Shaikh*Sultan and said that the whole case was a fabrication of lies on the part of Shaikh Sultan. He mentioned that he himself had abdicated in favour of Shaikh Sultan, and that he always preferred peaceful relations within the family and had no ambition to be the Ruler. He, declared that neither he nor his nephews would consider leaving Ras al Khaimah, where they had all their belongings and owned many houses, and that if necessary they would fight.. He stated that his position was serious, that Shaikh Sultan was denying them food (the Shaikh refuted this to me), and that they would very soon have to leave the gardens and go back to their houses. Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim then told how the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ajman had been trying to bring about a settlement but had failed owing to the obstinate attitude of Shaikh Sultan. He asked me at this point if Gover nment would intervene and bring about justice as mediation by tribal Shaikhs had failed. I replied that Government did not interfere with purely internal affairs amongst tribes, but that I would give the whole case consideration. 4. I then saw Shaikh Sultan bin Salim again on the 26th and gave him my opinion as follows (a) That the situation had been brought about largely by his own neglect of affairs in the past and weakness in of control in not checking at the time the people responsible for, the offences which he had told me about. (b) That his action in suddenly manning the town, in opening fire and banning entry into the town had been hasty and ill-considered. (c) That by expelling his brother and nephews from his territory he would not achieve a real answer to the problem, as they would remain his enemies and undoubtedly try to obtain their revenge. I I then asked him, in view of the above, to reconsider the whole matter and see if he could find another solution than resort to force. Meanshile he was to take no action until I saw him again next week. This he promised to Before leaving, he again stated that he would not tolerate the presence of his brother and nephev/s in'Ras al Khaimah, and that he could not be responsible for the safety of the oil-prospectors who might be interfered with z_ in the yin the area where his brothers and nephews were, I pointed out that he was responsible for all his Shaikhdom. He was very adamant in his belief that his life was in danger from the plots and intrigues of his nephews: in fact his general demeanour throughout the discussions was very nervous. He did not ask once for Government help, so he presumably thinks he is strong,enough to expel his brother and nephews by force, he He asked .f might build a tower over some wells outside Maureedh village and near his brothers position. I advised him not to and he agreed not to do this. He promised that he would distribute food equitably, and that he would not with hold food supplies from his brother. (The Residency Agent^ had originally diverted half the Ras al Khaimah food supplies to Rams, and this had a considerable effect bn Shaikh Sultan and he was most anxious about it. In view of there being free' movement to and from Ras al Khaimah, Residency Agent Sharjah was since instructed to supply the whole quota-to Ras al Khaimah itself. In my opinion the control of the distribution of foodstuffs is our best lever should we wish to bring pressure to bear in this case). 5. I then saw Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim again, told him that Shaikh Sultan would take no/ action until I had seen him again, and I asked Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim to do the same to which he agreed. He then emphasised the importance of the return of his family and followers from the gardens to Ras al Khaimah to their houses as it was a had timefor sickness in the gardens I told him to be 7 patient as the matter was under consideration. Both Shaikhs returned from Sharjah on the 27th. As regards food supplies Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim stated that Shaikh Sultan had witheld food supplies from him. (Shaikh Sultan had denied this to me). 6 . The situation appearing to be one of stalemate, both sides being firm in their own aims, but ready to obey Government orders, I called for Shaikh of Sharjah, Ajman and Kalba to ‘obtain their views. The Shaikh of Sharjah is closely related to the Ras al Khaimah families and he and his brother have been mediating in the case, and have up to now been maintaining with some success a period of truce between the two parties. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr mentioned how he had persistently tried to get Shaikh Sultan of Ras al Khaimah to agree to his brother and nephews return, and that he would guarantee their good behaviour. However, Shaikh Sultan bin Salim had been very obstinate throughout and repeatedly refused idea^of allowing his nephews to return, in Shaikh of Sharjah's opinion, the accusation by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim that the Amir of Shamal had been approached by the nephews with the object of raising a revolt against the Ruler was entirely false, as he himself interviewed the Amir of Shamal. The Shaikh of Sharjah then gave it as his opinion that Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim and nephews, owning considerable property in Ras al Khaimah and having a big following, could not leave the,town, and that it wguld be an injustice for them to have to do so. He then stated that it was only by Government intervention that considerable blood shed and its attendant unrest and protacted fends could be avoided. He thought that both parties would obey at once whatever Government decided. I gave him a non-committal reply and thanked him for his effort to keep the peace, which indeed he has done so far. ' ShaikhShaikh Rashid bin Hurnaid of Ajman and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed of Kalba were of the same opinion as the Shaikh of Sharjah, and earnestly invoked Government intervention. Ahmad Shaikh Khalid bin Kxmald suggested, off the record, that two of Shaikh Sultans sons, Salim and Khalid, and two of Shaikh Mohammed sons, Saqr and Abdulla, be exiled for a period of 6 months. This was the only novel suggestion offered. • Apparently Shaikh Sultan bin Salim resented Shaikh Khallgd * s presence as a mediator as Shaikh Khalid himself had been*under similar circumstances some years ago. 7. (a) In conclusion I would emphasize that whatever policy is now adopted, either to intervene or not to intervene, we should now declare that policy as soon as possible. (b) in view of the programme of the P.C.L.. prospectors to work in the Ras al Khaimah area a state of unreso ana fighting is most undesirable. (c) I think it is the general desire, and it is becoming greater than ever before, on the part of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs that Government should control more directly, and intervene in tribal disputes. This is I believe in contravention to our policy that has been followed upto now. (d) with particular reference to this Ras Al Khaimah dispute, which is admittedly between two Shaikhs of one family^ I offer the following suggestions' for what they are worthi er) Government order Shaikh Sultan bin Salim to alloy/ • the return of Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim and his family to Ras al Khaimah and to live there. (t£) Government get a guarantee of good behaviour and loyalty to the Ruler from Shaikh Mohammed bin S^Lim, which if eveJt,br kfri- means his expuls/ion together with^pamily, by Government from Ras al Khaimah. To enforce N/para (r) should Shaikh Sultan bin. Salim disagree, saiiftion/on food supply could be levied, and if necessary the visit of a sloop to Ras al Khaimah be arranged.* 8 . Finally, I would request that I may be given early^ instructions in this case, and authority to declare our policy to try to bring to an end the unsettled state of affairs now existing in Ras al Khaimah. ** expelled by the Shaikh of Sharjah Political Officer, Trucial Coast. 30/9/46Telegram From * To No. 249.

The political Officer, prucial Coast, has also suggested that Government should obtain a guarantee of good behaviour and loyalty to the Ruler from Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim, and make it clear to him that his failure to keep this guarantee would result in Government expelling him and his family from Ras al Khaimah. 3. In my view, however, the present dispute is a purely family matter in which I do not consider tlxat Government should intervene, if you agree, therefore, I propose to instruct the Residency Agent, Sharjah, to inform Shaikh Sultan bin Salim and Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim that they must settle the matter amongst themselves. I also propose to tell the Residency Agent to remind them that they will be held responsible for the safety of all British subjects and property in Ras al Khaimah territory. 4.

This is contrary to the law of God and his prophet, and against humanity.

Your Memorandum No.343-3 dated the 22nd February, 1947. 2. I discussed the matter at length with the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah who requested me to be a signatory to a document to be drawn up by him under the terms of which he agreed to pay the same allowance as he is now paying to his brother and his nephews. They, on their part, might return to Ras al Khaimah where they were to deport themselves in a quiet and orderly manner. The document went on to say that if the relations failed to act on the terms of the agree ment they made themselves liable to punishment at the hands of His Majesty’s Government. 3. This I considered one-sided, and besides this pointed out to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah that the most I could do would be to witness the signatures and that I could not undertake to inflict punishment. After this the Shaikh withdrew the document requesting further time to negotiate with his brother. 4. • I have promised the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah that I will be present at the time of signing the docu ment provided I agree generally with its terms.

Before you came on tour the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah had, without consulting us, allowed his brother and.nephews to return to Has al Khaima*- unconditionally, probably because, with the approach of the summer migration of the townsmen to the date gardens, he realized that most of his subjects would in any case come under their influence. T 7 hen they had not executed the document there remained no question of your witnessing it. The position now is as it was before they were expelled. They are receiving their allowances, they have the run of his fort, and they appear to be behaving themselves; but another tussle can be expected in June when the Shaikh receives the next annual payment for his oil concession. His nephews are likely to demand a large share of it; and, as they know exactly how much it is, he will either have to meet their demands or run the risk of a coup dfttat.

The father Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim did the talking. He explained how he had been Shaikh hims^Sf for a time and had handed over power to his brother Shaikh Sultan ^ for the good of the family. Sultan however had ruled so badly that they had found it necessary to turn him out again. I enquired whether Shaikh Saqr was willing to observe all his predecessors’ treaties and engagements and he replied in the affirmative. 1 said I should have to think matters over and consult His Majesty's ^ Government before official recognition could be accorded. Shaikh Saqr is a small man with one eyej and not particular ly impressive, but on the whole I liked the look of him. Political Resident, Persian Gulf.C0HFIDE1ITIAL. D.O.No.156.0223 British Agency, Sharjah. Dated 21st Feb, 1948. / oLu\a, Please refer to my telegram No. 143 dated the 13th February, 1948. 4 * £ 2* I and the Residency Agent spent the 15th February in Has al Khaimah. I later saw Sultan bin Salim at the Agency on the 18th. I had not been able to get hold of him before. i 3. In Ras al Khaimah I found Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad bin Salim in charge assisted and advised by his father and by his elder brother Shaikh Humaid bin Muhammad. Most of the guards formerly employed by Sultan bin Salim had come over to Saqr and, in addition, he had received help from the Khavatir and from the Shaikh of Jazirat al Hamra. Members of the public interviewed separately thoroughly approved of the change in regime. 4 . it appears that Sultan bin Salim had feared such a coup d’etat ever since the sons of Muhammad bin Salim, whom Sultan bin Salim displaced from the Shaikhship 29 years ago, reached maturity. In anticipation of it, he had removed to Dubai all his movable property except a few pieces of furniture. Locked boxes in his house were found to be empty, and he had in Ras al Khaimah no arms except one rifle, and no ammunition. In addition, where he could collect taxes and customs dues in advance he had done so by issuing drafts on merchants vho usually have to pay customs duties. Allowances due from him in recent months had been similarly met, so that in effect they were in arrears. Considering that he has, as far as I can gather, disbursed very little indeed to facilitate the Oil Company’s work, it appears that he has got away with most C.J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. Confidential. BAHRU NT RECEIPT.of the money paid for this purpose, leaving his successors with the responsibility, an empty treasury, and the taxes mortgaged for some time to come. 5. After his expulsion from Has al Khaimah Sultan bin Salim also sent his second and third sons to occupy the village of Manai 1 because it produces a revenue of Rs. 15,000/- a year from tobacco cultivation. 6 . I found Saqr and his father most reasonable and anxious for our recognition and support. Without funds and with many demands upon them - some of them legacies of responsibility from Sultan bin Salim -, they recognize the weakness of their position. They are willing to subscribe to all previous agreements with and to the Oil Concession 7 # They appear to have dealt most fairly with the family and property of Sultan bin Salim. No one was injured and all were allowed to leave and to take their movable property with them. Only the house of Salim, Sultan bin Salimfe eldest son, was looted by the Khawatir• His rifle was, however, redeemed and returned to him by Muhammad bin Salim. Saqr is also reluctant to sequester Sultan bin Salim*s date gardens in Has al Khaimah, or to attach the income from them. He and his father stated that Sultan bin Salim had requested them through Muhammad bin Saqr to give him an allowance and up not to half of the royalties from oil. While/knowing how they would meet this expenditure they appeared to favour giving Sultan bin Salim a small allowance, if only to s&gt;,op him intriguing against them. They asked my advice and said that they would again consult us before finally deciding. 8# V/hen Sultan bin Salim saw me it was clear that he had given up any idea of regaining his position as Shaikh, unless he could get H.M.G*s support. Even he, supreme optimist that he is, appeared to realize that with a record like his he could hardly hope for that. Before coming to us he had tried all other means to regain his Shaikhdom and hadfailed. He has no friends in Ras al Khaimah and no Trucial Shaikh able to do so is willing to help him. 9. He then said that he wanted an allowance. I informed him that if he wanted our assistance he should first explain what had happened to all the oil payments, hacause it was clear that he had not disbursed any but small amounts to facilitate the Company^ work. He alleged that all his wealth had been kept in gold in Ras al Khaimah and had been looted by Saqr; but in face of the evidence of his lack of precautions in Ras al Khaiirah and of his prolonged and frequent visits to, and residence in, Dubai he could not maintain this excuse. Instead, he much modified his demand for an allowance. Asked if he would accept from his successor identical treatment that he as Shaikh accorded to him, he said that he would do so provided that any allowances agreed the upon were paid through^/Agency. I replied that would not be identical treatment and that, had his brother^ and nephew’s allowances been paid through the Agency or indeed paid at all, he would probably not have been expelled. 10. To conclude: I think that Saqr has the support of the people of Ras al Khaimah, of the Khawatir and the Shaikh of Jazirat al Hamra, and of his five brothers. From what we know of him I think he has the attributes of a good Shaikh. He is amenable to our influence and is likely to be so for some years to come. In time he will probably also be able effectively to help the Oil Company to work their concession. His present weakness is due to lack of money but, with our recognition,he would receive the customs and other revenues of the Shaikhdomt and payments from the Oil Company. With frugality they should suffice to meet his responsibilities; and as time passes he should be able to strengthen his financial position. I recommend that we recognize him on conditions similar to those recommended in the Kalba case - my D.O. Ho. 94.0220 dated the 25th January, 1948.4 11 oiiltan bin Salim has* I think* no chance of reinstalling himself as Shaikh; and his sons have not tte courage, the influence, or the money to do so. Indeed, his eldest son has already complained that his father has given him nothing for his maintenance. He has had to pawn his fountain pen. Sultan bin Salim is, however, likely to continue to intrigue. It is, I believe, usual to give deposed Shaikhs some allowance; and the fact that he behaved so badly to his brother does not mean that his successor should behave badly to him. If asked for advice again, I think we should inform Saqr that he should work out the problem with Sultan bin Salim himself, but that we favour his being given a small allowance, although for the first year at any rate the allowance, and possibly the income from his gardens, might have to be offset against the customs duties he collected in advance before leaving and against the dues he left unpaid. To Shaikh Sultan we should intimate that we have withdrawn our recognition from him, j that he should withdraw his sons and his men from Nanai 1 and the Wadi el Qaur, and that he should not intrigue against his / successor. 12 . I do not think there is any chance of our recovering from him any of the funds that he has got a^ay wither that it is practical to try to do so. The idea of separate State funds and a privy purse for the Ruler is quite unknown on the Trucial Coast. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim*s conduct over a period of years, however, is a good illustration of the extent to which the Jawasim Shaikhs regard the income of their Shaikhdoms as their own personal property to be enjoyed arbitrarily, and an illustration of the extent to which they shirk the responsibilities of Rulership. The whole emphasis of Sultan bin Salim’s recent talks with me was on his claims to the wealth of the Shaikhdom, even after he had surrendered all control and responsibility.D.O. no. C/266. POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 15th March, 1948 / Dear Sir Rupert please refer to the correspondence ending with your, endorsenent No.528-S dated the 4th irarch, 1948, about the Pas al Khaitnah succession. I enclose for your record a copy of Jackson’s demi-official letter No.15^.0223, dated the 21st February, 1948. As to -he first I acted on Jackson’s reconuAendation, and told him that the question of an allowance would probably rest betv/een himself and Saqr bin Mohammed. As to the second, I said the position struck me as rather like that of the Shaich of Kuwait vis a vis his date gardens in Iraq, and that I was strongly opposed to his going himself, sending his relatives, or sending armed men to his date gardens. I told him that he should not meddle in Has al Khaimah politics. 3. It has struck me that it would be a good idea if, ultimately, we could announce a decision in the Kas al Khaimah and Kalba cases simultaneously, and I am asking Jackson about this. As you will see from my letter to you of today’s date about Kalba, the case rests there with Jackson being asked to inquire whether Humaid bin Mohaurimed will accept the regency. Meanwhile, I am working out the specific conditions unior whicn we should recognise Saqr bin Mohammed as I am fairly certain we ought to do. 2. Sultan bin Sulim came to see me at Sharjah on the 6 th of March and asked me 1 . about an allowance for himself 2 . as to whether he could go himself or send his sons or his men to his date gardens at Mana’l.

At Dhaid he collected round him a number of bedouin of the Awamir, Wuhibah, Duru’, Nai*m and Manasir, and he sent a message through the Shaikh of A^man to Ali bin Saif of the Khawatir of Rasal Khaimah Asking him to come to Dhaid to negotiate with him for the return of the camels, rifles and house-hold effects alleged to have been stolen by the Khawatir from his son's house at Has al Khaimah at the time of the coup d’etat. 3. Sultan bin Salim later visited Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad at Hira and asked him to let him occupy Dhaid Fort. Shaikh Khalid refused to permit him to do so. Sultan bin Salim then called on Shaikh Rahmah bin Abdur Rahman of Hira and invited him to stay with him at Dhaid. Shaikh Kahmah bin Abdur Rahman also refused. 4 . There were indications that Sultan bin Salim intended to instal himself in Dhaid and to use it a base from which to harass his brother and nephew in Ras al Khaimah, and to bring pressure on the Khawatir, who are supporting them. 5 . For Sultan bin Salim to remain in Dhaid and to collect Awamir and Manasir bedouin round him was likely to lead to insecurity in the desert and to trouble for the new Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah.

He denied all intention to create trouble for his nephew, and undertook not to visit Dhaid again without first informing me or the Residency Agent of his intention to visit Dhaid and of the reasons for his visit.COI\Tp::..NTIAI 0 EXPRESS LETTER From Political Resident, Bahrain, To Political Agent, Bahrain.

Please refer to correspondence endin Sir Rupert Hay's immediate telegram No. Nil uateu tne 21st July informing me that nc neard unofficially that K.M.S. f 1 Wren' was due at Sharjah p.m. July 24th. Wren arrived at Snarjah at about 6 p.m. on July 2^x0 and I boarded immediately and confirmed with the Officer Commanding that he was willing to take Sultan bin Salim / and myself to Bahrain. I then returned to the Sharjah Agency building from where I sent for Sultan bin Salim, who had come to Sharjah at my request on the 19th July, but whom I had not seen. My idea was that he would be more suspicious if he had been asked to see me and it would then have been more difficult to give him a con vincing excuse for asking him iso remain on in Sharjah until Wren arrived. 2 . Sultan bin Salim arrived upstairs in the Agency about 6 o'clock and came into the room with the Residency Agent. He .greeted me in the ordinary way and was apparently +C*.M -i unarmed -^not even wo-pe a dagger. After the usual pre liminaries, I told hiir^ as was the case that he had been warned several times by Mr. Jackson against creating trouble for his nephews in Ras al .Khaimah and that he had been told that if he continued to do so he would be summoned to stay in Bahrain. He made the usual excuses i about......about not intending any harm,but I dre?. r his attention to the incident reported in my telegram Ho.T/3, dated the 18th July and said that he should come to Bahrain with me. He said, as I expected he would, that he wanted time to arrange his affairs, but I replied that this cot’I d not be given to Mm and that he should come with me immediately. He tried to kiss my head in token of submission and a request to rescind the orde^. Then I asked him to come along and we walked dov/n-stairs. \ He insisted on following me. When v/e got to the porch I walked towards the ci’r and as I was doing so saw Sultan bin Salim miming along the front of the Agency building followed closely by Residency Agent who was grabbing at him. He ran the length of the building (about 20 yards perhaos) towards Khan Saheb Abdutf Pazzak's house and then turned down the lane between that house and the Agency building. The Residency Agent did not follow him but one or perhaps two of the Agency guards with rifles did. I then heard a shot which I thought the guard had fired and I ran up to the opening of the lane. As 1 did so there were perhaps two or three mere shots / « ana when I got there I saw Sultan bin Salim running up the lane with an automatic pistol in his hand with which he was firing towards the entrance as he ran. The guard or guards were returning his fire from the entrance. 1 thought one round frem the pistol went into the sand near my feet, but I cannot be certain. In a few seconds Sultan bin Salim had got to the end of the lane and turned around out of sight. He could have hidden anywhere in the maze of wicker huts. The Residency Agent states that while he was trying to catch Sultan bin Salim, the latter pulled the automatic pistol from inside the upper portion of the *Dish Dasha' and said 'let me go or I will kill0 you.” The Residency Agent states that two or three shots were fired at him but they hit the wall behind him. many shots he had let off and he said he had fired four. When I commented upon his missing v;ith all four, he said that I had not warned him to fire effectively, which was true. but several times, that Sultan bin Salim would come with me quietly if directed to do so. Indeed he said that he himself would guarantee this. I had contemplated refusal on his part, but I did not think that it would take the form of murderous violence. After all this ex-Shaikh was only, like the others of his type in the past, asked to come and stay in Bahrain - he was not be ing sent to prison. 5. Immediately after the shooting, I sent word to the Shaikh of Sharjah asking him to arrest Sultan bin and arrived in Bahrain at 9.30 a.m. on the 25th July. to Sir Rupert Hay v/as marked n Immediate', it would a] from his reply (telegram No.639, dated the 19th July) with NO priority that my request for assistance in the matter 6 \ of the sending of the sloop was treated with no urgency ^ 1 nor was there any question whatsoever of it being pressed upon the Senior Naval Officer.

I left Sharjah in Wren at 4 a.m, on the 24th July 7. Although my telegram No.T/3 dated the 18th July Senior Naval OfficerOfficer, The latter^ I und^rsttijd from the Ccrnmanding Officer of the Wren ; did not even inform the Commanding Officer, Wren, what he was to go to Sharjah for / so that it would seem ar i f he had not teen informed that the Wren was required urgently and for important political work. In fact the Commend'ng Officer of the Wren # informed ve that If hs had teen asked he could have been in Sharjah 24 hours earlier. It is of course impossible to say that if he had been, Sultan bin Salim would not have acted as he did; but it is true that the longer he was kept waiting for me to see him (which was dependent on the tr&amp;n’&amp; -vcrival) the piore suspicious he became and consequently the more the difficult to deal with. S. I have telegraphed to the Residency Agent, Sharjah, inquiring as to the outs of Sultan bin Salim and as to whether there en any further developments.

Dear Colonel Galloway, I enclose a copy of a further telegram from Jassim on the subject of Sultan bin Salim in continua- Letter No.C/R-127, dated the 28th July, 1948. As I verbally informed you, I hope to 'go to Sharjah in the 'Wild Goose' about the 9th instant in order to try and concert some measures against the Shaikh of Sharjah for his and his brothers part in aiding Sultan bin Salim. I have little or no hope of being able to get him ar- rested, but shoui# do the best I can to get the Rulers, with whom we are in relations, to keep him out of their territories. At the stage we have now reached, I can think of nothing else to do. His Excellency Lt. Col. A.C. Galloway, CIE, OEE, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN. tion ending with Agency Printed Yours sincerely,i M-r* Hf' CONFIDENTIAL N o.B/267 (14/229) PERSIAN GULF NESID^^CY BAHRAIN Rrd August, 1948 n of July 26th Reference your Express Letter No.C/P-^ and Printed Letter No.C/R-127 of July 28th. 2 . I am sorry to hear of the unpleasant experience both you and the Residency Agent suffered in Sharjah recently. I agree that it was n*t to be expected that Sultan bin Salim would resort to the use of firearms in an endeavour to escape from a few months sojourn in Bahrain. He is, as you know as well as T do, of peculiar temperament and he must have been considerably unset by the recent happenings in Ras al Khaimah. This, however, do^s not excuse him, and we shall have to consider the possibilities of punishing him. 3 . I don’t quite see w)ay Sultan bin Saqr should not have handed his cousin over to you. After all Jowasimi murders Jowasimi, though, in the Trucial Coast code of honour, the handing over of a troublesome Shaikh for temporary retirement in Bahrain may be considered more heinous^in that 4 . The refusal of Sultan bin Saqr to arrest, or at least to hold, Sultan bin Salim in Sharjah is an unpleasant display of non- cooperation. He may have a plausible excuse, if so T should be glad to hear of it from you. If not, do you pronose to take any action against him ?NOTE ON SULTAN BIN SALIM'S ACTIVITIES \ Soon after Sultan bin Salim's escape from the Agency at about 6.30 p.m* on the 23rd July I sent a messenger by ear to see the Shaikh of Sharjah at the Falaj and to tell him from me that he should arrest him as he was hiding in Sharjah. The messenger conveyed the message to the Shaikh of Sharjah at onee and in addition I sent a letter to him confirming the message. He sent me a reply imiftediately saying thet on his return from the Falaj he did not find Sultan bln Salim but that he had sent his men to search for him in the houses and that he will be arrested if found. At the same time I sent a letter to the Shaikh of Dubai asking him to arrest Sultan bin Salim if he enters his territory. As soon as he received it his son Rashid came to see me at Sharjah and reported to me that he deployed guards all along the Dubai-Sharjah road, posted guards at Sultan bin Salim's house in Dairah and impounded his two trucks. He expressed willingness to do all in his power to have Sultan bin Salim arrested wherever he may be. On the following day, however, Shaikhs Said, Juma'h, Rashid and others held a meeting to discuss this question and to fix up the extent of co-operation they should give to the Government in this matter. Shaikh Juma'h's and Than! bln Abdullah's attitude was highly unsatisfactory. They suggested that they should not give any help to the Govern ment in this matter besides arresting Sultan bin Salim if he came to Dubai town only and the fact became known to the Government. These two persons prevailed upon Said and Rashid who followed their advice and consequently removed the guards they had posted at Sultan bin Salim's house and disbanded all the watch and ward arrangements. Rashid had promised to give one of the two trucks of Sultan bin Salim To Shaikh Saqr of Ras al Khaimah to help him in chasing outSultan bin Salim but changed his mind. He alleges that if he hands over the truck to Saqr Sultan bin Salim might interfere with Dubai taxis using Wadi el Qor on their way to the Batinah and back. Apart from this,the Shaikh of Dubai is allowing foodstuff, arras and ammunition to be sent from Dubai to Manai 1 for Sultan bin Salim in Dubai cars by his ( Sultan bin Salim’s) brother-in-law, one Khalifah bin Sultan who is a Dubai subject. Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad of Ras al Khaimah immediately sent a party of men on camels as far as Khatt but could not risk going any further as he was not sure of the attitude of the Khawatir who were being influenced by Sultan bin Salim. On the 24th July, in accordance with your verbal instructions^I issued letters to all the Trucial Shaikhs asking them to arrest Sultan bin Salim should he enter the territory under their control. Most of them replied promising to do so. SULTAN After leaving the Agency Sultan bin Salim went to a nearby house occupied by Al Huraiz. He knocked on the door and told the occupants that he wanted to take refuge in their house till sunset as he thought that the Agency guards would follow him. In the meantime he loaded his pistol and, seeing that no one had followed him, he went away and is reported to have entered the house of Khalid bin Khalid, nephew of the Shaikh of Sharjah. Khalid bin Khalid resented his presence in his house and sent word to the Shaikh of Sharjah reporting Sultan’s presence in his house and asking him to make arrange ments for his removal. Sultan bin Salim was then removed to Muhammad bin Saqr’s house where he was cared for and kept under guard. He was in a considerable state of fear and frenzy# Next day ( i.e#, the 24th July ) at dawn, after a stay of 12 hours in Sharjah,arrangements were made by Muhammad bin Saqr for Sultan bin Salim’s escape from Sharjah. Two camels belonging to Rashid bin Mani* were borrowed and Sultan bin Salim was sent away on them with an escort of two of the BeniQitab named Abdullah bin Silumah and Ibn Khisoob and his own slave al Ramiz* They proceeded to Muwailihj a Beni Qitab encampment about 8 miles from Sharjah* There Sultan bin Salim was joined by a guard of the Shaikh of Hirah named Salih Bal Irshad ( who supplied part of the information contained in this note ) and a Qitabi named Rashid bin Mutraq as-Saman who is a regular employee of the Shaikh of Sharjah. From Muwailih Sultan bin Salim proceeded to NABAIBIGH, a water hole situated five miles west of Dhaid. He visited Adhan^came into contact with Ali bin Saif of the Khawatir and then returned to NABAIBIGH. He stayed five days at NABAIBIGH making plans for his future movements and ultimate destination and also awaiting supplies of food, arms, ammunition and other requirements from Sharjah and Dubai which he got. During the time he was encamped at NABAIBIGH the Shaikh of Sharjah sent him a messenger by car with a message and got his reply and he was in constant touch with Sharjah and Dubai* When all was fixed up, he moved from NABAIBIGH on the 31st July, with an escort of 12 men passed through Dhaid, collected more escorts and continued the journey. At noon on the same day he and his party numbering some 30 men halted at Kadra, a deserted village situated at the foot of the hills east of the entrance to Wadi el Qor* After taking lunch there he pro ceeded direct to Manai 1 and is there now. His escort consisted of Beni Qitab, Khawatir, Harasis, Tunaij and GhufUla. On that day Rashid bin Said, in order to find out the whereabouts of Sultan bin Salim at my request, sent one of his men in a truck to Dhaid to enquire about him. He was told that Sultan bin Salim had gone to Manai* via Kadra. He followed him and saw him camped at Kadra. Sultan bin Salim, according to Rashid’s man, was very reserved and deliberately avoided disclosing how and by whom he was assisted in escaping from Sharjah. Sultan bin Salim purposely avoided following car tracks in his journey to Mania* as he was afraid that he would be chased by motor- 4 - cars. He chose NABAIBIGH as the first place of halt as it is surrounded by high and steep sand hills over which cars cannot climb. He has posted guards in Wadi el Qor near the entrance to Wadi Manai* for the inspection of all trucks that pass through the Wadi. His future plans are not known, but he is stated to be visiting Adhan village on the 14th August where he has a wife from the Khawatir tribe. His brother Muhammad bin Salim told me that he had received a letter from Sultan bin Salim blaming him for complaining against him to the Political Agent and demanding his deportation. At the same time he expressed his willingness to come to terms with him and with his sons. is Sultan bin Salim^reported to have bandaged his left shoulder and alleged that he had sustained a slight wound. Rashid’s messenger and the Shaikh of Hira’s man who met him after leaving Sharjah reported that they had seen the bandage but not the actual wound. It is felt that Sultan bin Salim, by branding and bandaging his shoulder, intends to support his argument that he fired only after he had been fired on and wounded. Persons who saw him in Sharjah soon after his escape from the Agency did not see any blood on his clothds. There is no doubt that it was only through the help of Muhammad bin Saqr and the connivance of the Shaikh of Sharjah that Sultan bin Salim could at all escape from Sharjah. Muhammad bin Saqr who is a very intimate friend of Sultan bin Salim did all he could to protect him and to make all arrangements for his escape. He supplied him with three 10 shot rifles, clothes, foodstuff such as rice, wheat and even Halwa. The Shaikh of Sharjah is aware of all this which had his consent but naturally denies all knowledge about it. he even denies knowing that Sultan bin Salim was encamped for 5 days at NABAIBIGH whereas he was in constant touch with him. After Sultan bin Salim’s incident I met the Shaikh of Sharjah three timeSjtold him of the reports I had received about this- 5 matter and advised him to change his attitude and to co operate with the Government as this will eventually lead to his own advantage. He expressed his prepar/edness to do all he can to please the Government and to fall in with theIr wishes but that he was unsuccessful in securing the arrest of Sultan bin Salim. I told him that this would not absolve him from his responsibilities as all the facts of the case are well kiown to me and to everyone on the Trucial Coast. I added that he was asked by me during the time Sultan bin Salim was hiding in Sharjah and by the Political Agent to arrest him which he failed to do and that the mere allegation that Sultan bin Salim succeeded in making good his escape is not a convincing excuse and does not mean that he did/duty. He said that as Sultan bin Salim puts his confidence in the Shaikh of Dubai the latter might be in a better position to secure his arrest. I told him this is entirely a different In my view none of the Trucial Shaikhs will make a real effort to arrest Sultan bin Salim if he enters their territory; they will, on the contrary, help him to escape. It is only through pressure on our part that they will try to have him arrested. H is very difficult, if not jbhx impossible, to arrest Sultan bin Salim while he is at Manai*. Manai* enjoys such an invulnerable position that an open attack on it will inevitably result in a heavy loss on the side of the attackers. The Shaikh of Dubai, to some extent, can be held responsible for arresting him as Sultan bin Salim, after losing the Shaikhshlp, made Dubai his permanent residence and thus acquired the status of ‘jar 1 (neighbour). The Shaikh of Dubai is, therefore, according to local custom, responsible for any acts done by or against his ’jar*. The Shaikh of Dubai, however, does not admit that Sultan bin Salim has the status of ’jar 1 as he has been living in Dubai since the time he was Shaikh of Has al Khaimah his question^does not help in absolving him from his responsibi lities.CONFIDENTIAL .

August and got there on the 10th evening. On the 11th I saw the Shaikh of Sharjah and his brother, Mohammed bin Saqr and,also Rashid bin Saiyid, son of the Shaikh of Dubai. I now enclose a copy of a note by Jassim, a reference to which will make the rest of this letter clearer. 3. . I accused the Shaikh of Sharjah and his brother of deliberate non-co-operation with the Government and I think I made it clear to them that we felt very strongly about it. As you might imagine, the discussion followed the usual pattern. There were denials, vows of loyalty, promises of help, requests for proof, etc. etc. etc. I asked them whether they thought me lacking in ordinary intelligence when they appeared to expect me to believe that Sultan bin Salim spent nearly 12 hours (not 20 hours as previously reported) in Sharjah town without their knowing and was able to get camels and food and arms without their help. They asked me what was re quired of them and I told Sultan bin Saqr that he should send his brother Mohammed to me at Bahrain by the next B.I. ship. He di(f not promise to do so but he did not refuse and I propose to keep the pressure up about this. 2 I went to Sharjah in the 'Wren' on the 8th of 4 His Excellency Lt. Col. A.C. Galloway, CIE, QBE Political Resident, Persian Gulf, B A H R A IN.4. I also of course stated that 1 wanted Sultan bin Salim arrested and handed over to the Residency Agent, but, as circumstances stand at present, I think it would be quite in vain to expect the Shaikh of Sharjah to be able, even if he were willing, to do this. I did not, as I saw no reason why I should, give him fair warning, of the other measures which I propose to take in order to punish him. They are (a) Stoppage of grant of travel facilities for his subjects. This I have told Jassim to act upon forthwith. It will result in loss of a 'face* In Sharjah more than any practical result; the people who want to leave there for work in Qatar and other places will still be able to do so in sailing boats. (b) Stoppage of the calls of B.I. Steamers at Sharjah. I should be grateful if you would be good enough to address the Agents asking them to &amp;op all calls of their steamers at Sharjah forthwith. (c) A partial stoppage of quotas of food and cloth; the result of doing this will have to be con sidered, but I think I shall be able to recommend it; I shall address you further. v 5. My talk with Rashid bin Saiyid was more or less on the same lines as that with the Shaikh of Sharjah, but there was less feeling about it on both sides; I could not hold the Dubai people as guilty as Sharjah nor did Rashid see any reason why he should be so held. He of course promised all help - he could as a matter of fact have done a great deal more - and asked me what I wanted. I told him that I merely wanted what I had asked him already to do i.e. to arrest Sultan bin Selim If he entered Dubai territory. I then asked him to hand over Sultan bin Salim’s two trucks (mentioned in Jassim’s note) to Saqr bin Mohammed, Shaikh of Has al Khaimah. He promised to do so and then, as also reported by Jassim, started whispering to Jassim that if he handed over the trucks to Saqr his own taxis would1 ^? would be debarred from using the Wadi el Qor. I told him that he need not hand the trucks over to Saqr, but ho must hand them over to Jassim. To this he readily agreed knowing fully well that Jassim would give the for the form and the matter when dealing with people like Sultan bin Salim will probably remain a fugitive and may possibly stay immured in the Manai* defile, which is a branch of the Wadi el Qor; though I must say that I heard a slender rumour that Sultan bin Salim has gone to Muscat and I have telegraphed to Stobart to ask the Muscat Govern ment to arrest him if this is the case. Apart therefore from the blow to our prestige caused by this incident, the only practical damaging result is the closure to us of the Wadi el Qor, At the moment, at any rate, it can only be opened by force and fairly considerable force at that. However as, except for communication purposes, the oil companies are not interested, we may perhaps merely take the measure as detailed against Sharjah and wait for the Bsults if any. If it is regarded as urgent that the \ Wadi should be opened for communications, then more than political measures will be required. trucks to Saqr - in fact I told him to do so. So much this! 6.

BAHRAIN RECEIPT.Translation of letter No.1338, dated the 24th Sh^wwal, 1367 (20.8.48) from the Ruler of Sharjah, to the P.A., Bahrain. After Compliments, ( i ** Your Excellency, on the 14th August, 1948, Your Honour called me and my brother, Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr, to the Agency, to which we responded readily. But immediately we appeared before you we saw you greatly upset in contrast to your characteristic mildness - the light of your clemency had changed to the fire of your anger. You enquired from us about Shaikh Sultan bin Salim and we informed you the fact so far as we were concerned - that we had no connection with him and that since he p c arted with you we had not known any thing about him; for we were not present in the town then. Moreover, he is not one of our subjects whom we are responsible for nor was he committed to our custody from which he escaped. He is an independent person unto himself - you contact him and correspond with him direct We tried to make excuses in the face of all the accusations put to our charge, but you did not accent them. Then we asked you to adduce proof for what was misrepresented to you but you would not listen to our plea; instead you asked for my brother to leave for Bahrain, and when we asked about the reason necessitat ing this, you refrained to declare and pressed on his departure. We, however, had no objection so long as in that lay your pleasure. Herewith is my brother coming to you in compliance iwith your orders. If it had been falsified to you that Shaikh Sultan had remained in Sharjah for 20 hours or less, we request you to call upon your informant to establish the truth of his information and we are prepared to suffer any consequences which the law or justice imposes or ?hich Your Excellency deem appropriate. Further, the Residency Agent has informed us that Rashid bin Buti is the person who wrote to you about this; well we do accept the evidence of the said person or of any reliable non-interested persons. Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT, Ho. Date.?' J?, you/-*c, IlipiPRMBaBHHMHMMMMB s Eteil 2 You, 0 Your Excellency, is the guardian of justice and equity and wielder of power so that it does not behove you to listen to whatever is rumoured without their being supported by sound proofs and only after due reflection (as it also does not behove you) to take for granted whatever is reported to you by any falsifier or self-interested person. We request in the name of the mercy of the Government ind in the name of justice that we should not be taken to task for no fault committed by us or for any cause for which we are not responsible; for since we took the administration of the affairs of our government we have maintained the best relations possible with the British Government, expending all in our power of help, co-operation and non-opposition and so are we still. Usual Ending. \Confidential ; / I called on Shaikh Mohammad bin Saqr at His Highness' Palace at Qudhaibiyyah last night. The moment I s^t down he handed me a cover from his brother, the Ruler of Sharjah, which I enclose for P.A's perusal. Then he asked me whether I knew anything abo it what he was coming for. I pretended complete ignorance. Then he started to narrate the story which on the whole was on the same -line as that mentioned in the enclosure to Shaikh's letter attached. &lt; at the policy the Residency Agent follows in the Trucial Coast generally and with the Rulers particularly and at the blind support which his policy receives from the Governreent' s officials. He admit, he said, that in the course of nature Officers should place confidence in their subordinates but to some extent. He assured that if the Political Agent had made some independent enquiries matters would have taken different course and that the facts would have appeared to him differently. He asked bitterl y: 'Are we not a party to a treaty with H.M's Government? If so do we not deserve to be at least treated better?' He continued to say that the Residency Agent serves but his own interests and that it is rediculous that the Higher Officials should help him in attaining his object. He added that this attifiude on the part of the Government's officials would suggest that they are in favour of R.A's corrupt policy; otherwise not they would/have condoned his many ill-practices. Lastly he took out 2 covers - one addressed to the P.A. and the other to the P.R. and asked me how he could deliver them. I suggested that if he was going to see the P.A. it would be better for him to hand over the covers personally to the P.A. To this he agreed and asked me to get him an appointment with the P.A. He, however, requested me not to disclose to the P.A. the fact that I had met him at the Palace. From his talk I could glean that he is very resentful BA.HR \ t N receipt. J L ite.. // 0 ' *•NOTE WHITTEN BY. THE RULER OF SHARJAH AND SENT AS ENCLOSURE TO A PERSONAL LETTER ADDRESSED TO H.M. This is to inform you that His Excellency the Political Afent arrived here and called me and my brother Shaikh Muhammal bin Saqr to the Agency. When we reached there we found him greatly upset. He inquired from us about Shaikh Sultan bin Salim and we related the fact' to him, that is to say, that we had had no knowledge of him, since he left the Residency Agency and that we had not made any contact with him either. He did not listen to our plea. We asked him to adduce proof in support of what he had heard about us; but he would not give ear to what we said and 30 we came to the conclusion that this was due to misrepresentation made to him by the Residency Agent. The Political Agent then ordered my brother to leave for Bahrain and in spite of the fact that we asked about the reasons we could not know of our crime. However, we complied with his orders and herewith is my brother coming as the Political Agent instructed. The Residency Agent consults his own interests and plays a role in the Trucial Coast, taking of the poeple of the coast goods for his trade. He only helps his own customers. »*hen he sees a certain matter not progressing in accordance with his own policy he brings pressure to bear on the Political Agent to back his action, the Political Agent not realising this, and as the people here respect the Government and do not oppose her orders, he thinks he *has gained his objective. His policy thus operates aganst every one and his deeds are too glaring to require any comments. Ai e does his work in the name of the Government, choosing for himself some such brokers and underlings like Bin Kamil (in Sharjah) and Bin u hibash in Dubai who act as media to execute his desires and to help and convey liexto him. Does the Government acqiesce in her reputation being spoilt by him by his base deeds? Certainly no. If the Political Agent would contact the Shaikhs and the public individually and if they would conceive that he has thfiZ2 1 7 3 ) &lt;m 'V the inclination to dicover the real fact, a clear picture of the situation he would have. People cannot inform the Political Agent or any of the Political Officers because they are ignorant about the policy and aim of the ^o^ernment. On the contrary, they regard what is happening as consistent with the pdlicy of the Government in whom they see every support to the Residency Agent in all that he wishes. That is why they abstain fearing that the Government might leave them subjected to his arbitratiness and that he might get the better of them and by his intrigue fell them into his evil ways from which they can hope no deliverance. This is because his words are supported by the Government. Should the Goverrment wish to enquire into some facts about him, let her see into the large wealth that he has amassed in so short a time. Has he amassed it from trading in the past? Or did he have any money before which they knew? When he came to the Trucial Coast he was penniless. He made this money through Governments name and influence. I wish the Government would look at his condition which has changed with the changing volume of his money. The affairs of Hbu -^habi and Kalba are sufficient testimony to illustrate how he supports one party to-day and the other next. People here are in strait hardship because of his policy. Far it be that the Government would agree that an agent representing her should so flauntingly act, as if he would bring fortune for the Government. If the Government wishes to get at the fact let her do so and she will see what I mentioned to be a fact. And if she does not wish to make direct enquiries let her send some one on her behalf to contact the shaikhs, the merchants and the public/any place wherever and she will see the fact quite obvious. Should she, however, wish to do otherwise, she has her views. inV ' A . / rw ' ^ ^ confidential ^ f No•C/R-168.1 THii POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHIV Dated the nth September 8.

I tried to get away but the Agent caught hold of me by the clothes, and when I wrenched myself free he ottered four of his soldiers to fire on me, for no reason, and shoot me dead. The soldiers, fast at ny heels, started firing, to which scene the P.A. was a witness. I fired back in self- defence. Later I came to the Agent. Muhammed bin Kamel was then present. I was told by the Agent that Muhammed would later bring me news. Muhammed visited me in Dubai and said that the Agent wanted Rs 6,000/- to put his signature to the Peace Settlement. He took from me a paper declaring that whosoever presented the paper could collect the said amount. I am now awaiting the Peace Settlement... or the most unhappy consequences. The rumour says that I would have to pay Rs 20,000/- for what happened. This is quite contrary to the Justice and Fairplay of the Government. Have I committed any crime... or tried to way-lay people ...or looted anybody's property ... or maltreated any person, Arab or non-Arab, to deserve prosecution in the nature of deportation or death ?

If the Shaikh is to be arrested I am sure the Sultan will not incur the odium of actively assisting; but if only interview is intended and safe conduct granted he has promised to use his influence to persuade the Shaikh to go to Bahrain voluntarily. (N.P. 3 ???) 4. The Sultan says that the Shaikh has left Muscat but will not commit himself further.

No.(81/13/48), Sated the 26th October, 1948, sending me a copy of Ellison's telegram No.9, dated the 2ord October, 1948, about Sultan bin Salim. ^^ Sul can bin Sa] ic to ccme here under saie conduct arc then merely to 'interview' him would, in my opinion, mf.ke things worse than they are. He would tnen be free to go tack to anywhere on the Trucial Coast, and the first thing he would do would be to intrigue against his nephew, the Shaikh of R?s al Khaimah. The fet would then really be in the fire because we would be faced with a situation similar to the one oefore - with the added disadvrntage that we know and oultan tin Salim knovs that our orly method of coping with it has failed and must fail in the future. Promises of good conduct or the like from a man of his character are valueless. Now atleast he is in the position of being a 'proclaimed offender' and will not, I think, make trouble in or near Has al Khaimah. Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. BAHRAIN.EXPRESS LETTER [N, B % —This is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated, on receipt, with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed. To save time and formalities it is worded and signed as if it had been so despatched,] From Residency Agent, Sharjah. A* To Political Agent, Bahrain. \ CONFIDENTIAL: AT* ' §22.6243 Dated 24th October M 48. f Reference your express letter No.C/S-62 dated the 10th October, 1948. 2. The statement# of the Shaikh of Sharjah that it was I who said that his brother Muhammad should put up as the guest of the Shaikh of Bahrain is entirely untrue and is, no doubt, made with a malicious intent. The Shaikh of Sharjah observed strict secrecy over the arrangements connect ed with his brother’s departure to Bahrain and tried his best to keep me uninformed of them. Had I told him to make his brother a guest of the Shaikh or had I at least known that it was his intention to do so I would not have hesitated to inform you of it in my telegram No.768 dated the 1st September, 1948, in which I reported his brother’s departure. Furthermore, there is no reason why I should make such a suggestion to him. The Shaikh of Sharjah who has failed to dissuade me from reporting the facts of this case to you - which were naturally against his interests - thinks that he will be doing me great harm if he threw on me the responsibilty for any wrong acts committed by him and at the same time saved himself from the bad consequences of his acts. Although he realizes that he cannot achieve any useful purpose by making false statements, he thinks there is no harm in try ing. As you know the Shaikh of Sharjah perfectly well, I do not like to bother you with any more of his undesirable activities. I notice that he still vainly pretends that he was unaware of the whereabouts of Sultan bin Salim and insists on the adduction of proof etc. His object of doing so, s. 6.

He even tried unsuccessfully to bribe my driver in order to make him tell who came in contact with me and supplied me with information on the subject. 3. In spite of all what happened the Shaikh of Sharjah is still in contact with Sultan bin Salim, by correspondence and through one of his men named Ali bin Obaid bin Hazim. He sent this man thrice to Sultan bin Salim at Manai' although he ostensibly declared that he sent him to Wadi el Hilu ( which belongs to Sharjah but the entry to it is through Manai* ). In support of this, I enclose ( in original ) for your persual, part of a letter from Sultan bin Salim to Ali bin Obaid bin Hazim. The main part of this letter in which there was a reference to the Shaikh of Sharjah was cut by the Shaikh of Sharjah himself so that I should not see it in case the letter by any chance falls in my hand. There is no doubt that the Shaikh of Sharjah is still advising Sultan bin Salim not to comply with your orders. idency Agent, SharjahTRANSLAT ION; From i Sultan bin Salim To : Ali bin Obaid bin Hazim After Compliments* Your esteemed letter has been received and what you mentioned has been noted* As regards that work,TRANSLATION: Sultan bin Salim Ali bin Obaid bin Hazim After Compliments.

You will see that the Shaikh of Sharjah requests that the sanctions imposed on him may be lifted. In point of fact y he has not done anything to justify his request but on the contrary remains in communication with Sultan bin Salim, and tries to make matters difficult for us. Jasim tells me that he has heard that the Shaikh of Sharjah recently advised Sultan bin Salim not to give himself up under any circumstamces and suggested to him to go to Abu Dhabi secretly and from there travel by a sailing boat to Bahrain^ and go straight to the Shaikh of Bahrain and take sanctuary with him. Sultan bin Salim, it appears, did not like this suggestion and is awaiting a better solution for his problem. 4.

BAHRAIN RECEIPT Bahrain. *h MEMORANDUM Reference correspondence resting with your printed letter No. C/S-67 dated the 15th December 1948. On the 23rd December the Shaikh of Sharjah called on me afcd stated that he is greatly worried over H.M.G’s displeasure at him and the continuance of the sanctions. He requested me to let you know of his worries and to inform you that he is quite prepared to do whatever you may require of him. He added that H.M.G*s displeasure not only has had a very bad effect on him but has also put him down in the eyes of the public and gave the incentive to his enemies to intrigue against him and to create a lot of trouble for him. I told him that had he listened to our good advjce in the beginning he would have averted all the difficulties which he is now experiencing and foi which he is to blame himself. He said he aamits that he was wrong in all what he had done in the past which he extremely regrets now but requests you to pardon him and that he will in future adopt a straight forward and friendly attitude. I replied ^hat I will report to you what he said and let him know of your decision but I advised him that in the meantime he should prove what he now professes by deeds and show some sign of real co-operation with H.M.G. and compliance with their wishes. He said he will do what he can. 2. On the 25th December I heard that he sent a deputation of two Sharjah notables, Shaikh Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz and Abdullah bin Salih al Mutawwa*, with a letter to Sultan bin Salim advising him to give himself up to the Government. The deputation spent one whole day with Sultan2 S) ^ 2 ^' bin Salim at Huwailat in Wadi el Qaur and talked to him on tb&amp; subject. On the 28th December Shaikh Abullah bin Abdul Aziz&gt; a member of the deputation, came to me and told me that Sultan bin Salim evinced great interest in the Shaikh of Sharjah 1 s move and expressed willingness to accept his advice but wanted time to call his son Saqr from the Batinah, where he had gone hunting, in order to consult him. He promised to send his final decision to the Shaikh of Sharjah after 2 or 3 days. On the 29th the Shaikh of Sharjah again called on me and told me that he had sent the deputation in question with a letter to Sultan bin Salim and that the latter promised to let him know of his final decision in 2-3 days 1 time. He then showed me a letter he has received from Sultan bin Salim in reply to his thanking him for his advice and saying that his deputation will tell him the facts. intimation to the shaikh of Sharjah. Yesterday the Shaikh of Sharjah told me that he is going to approach Sultan bin Salim again and obtain his final reply. putting off his reply is to await the result of the interventicn of the Sultan of Muscat in his case although he did not disclose this to the deputation. is causing the shaikh of Sharjah much concern and each time he meets me he imploringly requests me to help him in obtain ing your orders for lifting this ban. that from time to time Sultan tin Salim comes to Dubai secretly and, after staying two or three days with his wife in his Dairah house, he returns to Mansi 1 or Huwailat. I do not doubt the authenticity of this report as the Shaikhs of Dubai like Sultan bin Salim who is married to one of relatives and help him in every way possible. 4.

From Jassim's note, you will see that both the Shaikh of Sharjah and Sultan bin Salim are weakening, and I consider that we should keep on the pressure on the former and give up having any more truck with Sultan bin Salim through the Sultan of Muscat. I do not want him to come to Bahrain to ’discuss' terms. If terms were to be put to him at all, it would, I think, have been better to do so on a 'take it or leave it' basis. As for the sugrestion, which Dredge showed me in Ellison's te legram the other day, that we should look after Sultan bin Salim's property while he is in exile, this is mere effrontery. In brief, in my opinion, I think the Sultan of Muscat should be told that we are not interested in bargaining with Sultan bin Salim. If you agree, I will also ask the Shaikh of Dubai to have Sultan bin Salim's house at Dairah, mentioned in paragraph 7 of Jassim's memorandum, vacated,and to lock it up and seal the doors in the presence of Stobart or Jassim. 2 I now enclose a copy of a confidential memorandum Yours sincerely His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.FROM RESIDENCY BAHRAIN TO AGENCIES KUWAIT AND MUSCAT Sir R.

I think that the travel ban has had a salutary and sobering effect upon the Shaikh of Sharjah, and that it has caused him considerable discomfort, as also, unfortunately, to his subjects, who in the present depressed conditions here, must needs travel in search of work elsewhere. 3. As there now appears to be some sign of a reasonable attitude on the Shaikh's part, I would suggest that it might be gracious to lift the travel ban and to make the outstanding air facilities payments. The best time for this might well be after the signing of the new air agreement. I see no objection to using Sultan bin Saqr's restoration to grace as a deliberate incentive to cooperate over this agreement. 4. Provided the necessary Arabic translation is forthcoming, I should like to put the preliminary negotiations in hand at once, as I believe that the psychological moment has arrived for them. C.J.

He also seems to be under the impression that he will get easier terms in Sharjah than in Muscat and I think we should avoid appearing over-anxious about the matter. 3. The Shaikh of Sharjah claims that the Political Resident requested him during his recent tour to act as go-between and has asked me whether he should do so. I do not remember the Political Resident making such a request and I should be grateful for confirmation of this impression. G.J. Jackson, Esquire, Acting Political Agent, Bahrain.

Bahrain, 17th November, 1S49. &lt;4^- /f, In some recent correspondence yv about Kalba Stobart said that he did not wish to visit the place by road J because there was a rumour that Sultan / bin Salim was back in his old haunts 1 near the Wadi Al Qaur. I made enquiries from Muscat, and Sa’id Ahmad the Minister for the Interior has stated that to the best of his knowledge Sultan is residing at Abu Buqra, a few miles north of Shinas. This is not very far from the Wadi Al Qaur, but Sa'id Saiyid has accepted responsibility for Sultan for a year from April 1949 and I doubt if there is any danger to be antici pated from him during this period. J \ C.J. Pelly, Esq., C.B.E. Political Agent, Bahrain.The Residency, Bahrain. (281/1/50) When I was at Muscat the Sultan reminded me that Sultan bin Salim’s year of exile ends on the 12th April next and said that he assumed that there would be no objection to his returning to his home then. I confirmed this assumption on the understanding that Sultan bin Salim did not misbehave himself in the mean while . ConfidenliaJ. Y ^ Bahrain receipt. C.J.

The sons of Sultan bin Salim have no business to run a toll gate across the Wadi al Qaur which, so far as it can be described as being in any Shaikh*s territory, is in the Sheikhdom of Ras al Khaimah. I think therefore that the Sultan of Muscat should be told that unless Sultan bin Salim has this toll gate removed and withdraws his sons and men from, the Wadi al Qaur, he should not return to the Trucial Coast.

'he has not misbehaved himself nor have we previous ly raised any objection to the toll gate which I believe has existed for some time. The Sultan ol Muscat has satisfactorily performed his part of the transaction, a responsibility which he was under no obligation to assume and 1 1 eel that in the circumstances we caniiot ask him to detain sultan bin oalim any longer. The 1 act that the Sultan is at present in Dhofar is a further complication. I think, however, we might well ask Chauncy to send for sultan bin Salim through the Muscat author ities and tell nim that we expect him after his return from exile to remove the toll gate and refrain from all interference with legit imate traffic passing through the Wadi al ^aur. I am not in iavour ol giving him a more direct order at present as it may be a long time before we can take steps to enforce it.

We talked trivialities and I avoided any show of cordiality on the one hand, or 'lecturing 11 on the other. He told me he proposed to spend his time between Dubai, where he has a house, Sharjah and Manai. He still has date gardens in various places and can probably contrive to live on capital, if not on income. Before we consider any question of allowances, I suggest we might let him wander from fort to fort as the unwanted guest of the other Shaikhs for a year or so. This is what has happened to Rahma bin Abdurrehman the former Shaikh of Hera, and suggests itself as one method of dealing with such people. C.J.

In 1948, this conflict resulted in Shaikh Sultan's nephew, Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad bin Salim, seizing the town (with permission of its inhabitants) and replacing Shaikh Sultan as its ruler.The subsequent correspondence in the file discusses Shaikh Saqr's recognition as ruler by the British and their attempts to detain and punish Shaikh Sultan for his actions.The file contains a mixture of internal correspondence between British officials that is in English, but also holds a large number of letters from local rulers that are in Arabic (with English translations).On folio 83, the file contains a family tree of the Jawasim (Āl Qawāsim ), the rulers of Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah and Kalba.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah Sultan bin Salim Āl Qāsimī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ras al-Khaimah</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002ea#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
