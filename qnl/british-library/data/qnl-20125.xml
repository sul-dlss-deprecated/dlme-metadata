A? , * The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, To: A^o . „ /W.^, J.C^Walton, Esq.* , M.C., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London# Dated Simla, the 4th September, 1939» Sir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the letter Ho. 94-S of 1929 dated the 2nd April from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and encloaire, of which a copy was forwarded to His Majesty 's Secretary of State for India, on the subject of the finances of Muscat* £. From the papers forwarded to His Majesty's Secretary of State with Foreign Secretary's letters Hoa^S-M and 31-M dated the 27th September 1923 and 17th April 1924 respectively it will be seen that in 1924 a similar proposal to that now made by the Political Resident for the raising of the tariff was not adopted by the Government of India, thou^i they implied their preparedness to entertain it in the last resort. Their reason was the anticipated difficulty with France and the United States of America in connection with the commerola3 treaties, guaranteeing the 5 per cent maximum rate, between those countries and Muscat. 3. Muscat affairs have of late shown a tendency to deteriorate. The integrity of the state is admittedly of great importance in view of its position at the mouth of the Persian/ a&lt;7 1 Persian Gulf, and the recommendation, renewedjas it is after mature .consideration in view of the growing danger of dissolution with v^iilch the kingdom is faced, seems now to call for more careful review, 4* There seems little doubt that the present trouble in Muscat is largely financial, and the Government of India concur with the Political Resident that the best hope of restoring the Gultan 's prestige and control lies in a permanent strengthening of his State finances. The causes of their present weeJaiGss are well analysed by the Political Agent. The principal causes are evidently v permanent, and there is little prospect of an unaided ^ recovery in the normal ebb and flow of commercial prosperity. 5 # The tariff increase suggested as a remedy, namely from 5^ to 7i*?J generally, and 16J5 on alcohol and cigarettes, is slight, and if it were not for the International difficulty, there would seem to be little room for hesitation in adopting it. The extent to which opposition from France and the United States of America is to be apprehended is a matter on which the Government of India are hardly competent to judge. They trust however that those difficulties will not be found in surmount able; indeed there seems reason to hope that America at least (though France may malce some difficulty on political grounds) will not seriously object to a slight raising of the customs duty fliaed over three-quarters of a century ago at a rate which, in the light of modem tariffs, appears trivial. The financial Interest of both countries in the proposal is believed to be negligible. 6. If His Majesty's Government agree, the Kesiderfc will be asked to approach the Sultan with a view to his/1 u liis formally requestiiig His Majesty's Government to approach the French and American Governments on his 'behalf in the matter.

On the general position of His Majesty 's Government In Muscat and on French American and Dutch interests in that country since 1908, reference may conveniently be made to paracraphs 53-59 and 76-78 of the India Olfice memorandum on Muscat, reprinted in P.G.13. So far as can he judged, French interests are now negligible, and, although a French Consulate is still maintained, it has had no incunbent for some years. United States interests in Muscat have, at amy rate since the end of the war, been in charge of the Political Agent, and, while it would appear from the Department of Overseas Trade report of 1929 on economic conditions in the Persian Gulf that there is a regular trade between the united States and Muscat, it is in itself of little importance, and has shorn a marked decrease in the last three years. There is no indication of any connection between Muscat and the Ketherlands, and the commercial agreement/ Under Secretary of State. K3R£IGN OFFICE. S .w.l. 4-7 source coujd be secured. It seems clear.in the circuuptancee, that It l s „„ ly „ n thl! n0 , ty the Govenment ol ttal a that the eltuatlon can he Batiefactorily eased. 4. The Importance of early action Is emphasised by recent correspondence, which indicates that the Sultan has renewed his threat to abdicate in the near uture. i is extremely desirable on general grounds that he should continue to govern, at any rate until the heir apparent is older and has.gained sumcient practical experience. it seems probable that much less difficulty would be experienced in dissuading His lifftnesp irom abdication, if it should prove practicable to ease his financial position by the adoption of the proposals now under consideration (conpare paragraph iv of the letter from the Muscat Finance Minister enclosed with India Office letter of 30th April. P.3129/29). Fran a different standpoint, it will be remembered (compare paragraphs 20-22 of the India Office memorandun) that the anas traffic subsidy of Rs.l lakh, which has been paid since 1912 in return for the co-operation of the ruler of Muscat in the suppression of the illicit traffic in arms, expires with the tenure of power by the present Sultan. Moreover, the latter, siould he abdicate, would as the Government of India point out. expect to receive an allowance commensurate with his dignity. The effect on Muscat finances of the loss of the arms traffic subsidy, coupled with the Imposition of an allowance for an ex-Sultan, would clearly be very serious. voJll., ^ Vle ' 01 M early action, one Poselhle ccurs. . i eM t0 lricr ,. M tlM ^ ^ as/as suggeBted, except in respect ol goods coveied by the provisions of the treaties with the United States of America, France and the Netherlands. It appears that these goods are a very anall proportion of the total imports, nor does it seem probable that the trade with these three countries would receive much stimulus from the resulting preference (except conceivably in alcohol and cigarettes). It therefore does not appear likely that the differentiation would affect materially the realisation of an increased customs revenue. 6. It may be best, however, in the first Instance to approach the governments of the United States of America and France as suggested by the Government of India. In the meantime, the course referred to in paragraph 5 above can be further considered, in case it becones urgently necessary to increase the Muscat revenue before a revision of the treaties with those countries can be effected. 7. I am accordingly to enquire whether Mr. Secretary Henderson sees any objection to the Sultan being approached in the manner proposed in paragraph 6 of the Government of India's letter. His Majesty's Government's subsequent proposals to the French and United States Governments would be based on the strong case which exists for Improving the financial position of the Muscat State, and could presumably be supported hy the recent precedents for conceding the principle ol tariff autonomy to Asiatic countries* 8.

As the question of Muscat finances may become an urgent one if the present Sultan abdicates especially if in tjjat event the existing Arms Traffic subsidy were discontinued), the Secretary of State would suggest that it might be worth while to examine the question of increasing the tariff except in respect of those goods which are covered by the provisions of the treaties with the United States of America, li^rance and the Netherlands. If it should appear that the desired increase in the customs revenue could be obtained while preserving the existing treaty rights of those three countries, and if the practical difficult* ^ ieo of differentiation could be surmounted, it might become ^ is to impose the increased duties on other goods (which pre-aumably at present constitute the vast bulk of the imports), without waiting for the conclusion of negotiations which are likely to occupy a considerable time with France and the United Statesof America. 3.

It is scarcely necessary to point out thattthe rate of five per cent, fixed over three-quarters of a century ago is ? in the light of modem tariffs, a very low one and that the new rates proposed must be considered no more than moderate.

My Lord, The State of Muscat and Oman, in South-Eastern Arabia, with which His Majesty's Government are in special . relations, has suffered for a period of several years from a condition of increasing financial stringency, and a critical situation has now arisen which calls for an immediate remedy. After much careful consideration of the problem, the Sultan and his advisers have reached the conclusion that an improvement in the financial position of the State can only 'be effected by an increase in the rate of the tariff on imported goods, and that it is important, in the interests of the prosperity and good government of the State, that this proposed increase should talze effect with the least possible delay. 2. The right of the Sultan of Muscat to raise the tariff of the State beyond a rate of five per cent is, however, limited by Article 3 of the Treaty between Muscat and the United States of America of 1833, and by Article 10 of the Treaty between Muscat and France of 1844. Copies of the texts of these articles are enclosed herein. Unless therefore the United States and French Goverments will consent to waive their rights to a maximum tariff of five per cent under these treaties, no general increase in the tariff will 'be practicable, and it will be impossible to adopt the suggested remedy, 3. In these circumstances the Sultan desires that the Governments of the United States of America and France should/ His Excellency The Right Honourable Lord Tyrrell, G.G .M.G., K .C .B., etc., etc., etc., Paris.ri should iDe approached with a view to securing from them at the earliest possible moment such a waiver of their rights * under the articles of the two treaties referred to above as will allow of a general increase in the Muscat tariff above the present flat rate of five per cent. Since there has been no French Consular representative at Muscat for some years past, and United States interests there are in charge of the Government of Inaia T s political Agent, Eis Highness has requested that Eis Majesty's Government should taJie up the matter with the two Governments concerned on their behalf. 4. I transmit to Your Lordship, herewith, a memorandum setting forth in greater detail the reasons which have impelled the Sultan to maize this request, and arguments in its support, and I shall be glad if you will adaress a note to the Goverment to which you are accredited based on the material contained in this memorandum, and will urge them to give the matter their early and favourable consideration. French interests in Muscat are nov/ aljnost negligible, and you may find it desirable to malie use of this point. But His Majesty's Government would be very reluctant to maize any statement the effect of which might be to revive French interest in this State, and you may therefore, on consideration, think it preferable not to draw attention to the unimportant character of their interests at the present time, unless the course of discus si onjshould render this inevitable. Should the French Government be prepared in principle to consent to this modification of their treaty rights, the question of the best method of giving legal effect to the modification or the relevant treaty provision can be subsequently considered, 5o /■ £&gt; ; •• 5.

A critical situation has now arisen which calls for an immediate remedy. 2. After careful consideration of the problem, the Sultan and his advisers have reached the conclusion that an improvement in the financial position of the State can only be effected by an increase in the tariff on imported goods, and that is important in the interests of the prosperity and good Government of the State, that this proposed increase should take effect as^/ possible. i, 3. The right of the Sultan of Muscat to raise the tariff of the State beyond a rate of five percent is limited by Article |, 3 of the Treaty between Muscat and the United States of America of 1333, and by Article 10 of the Treaty between Muscat and France of 1844. Copies of these articles are enclosed herein for convenience of reference. Unless the Government of the Republic and the Government of the United States will consent to waive their rights to a maximum tariff of five per cent under these treaties, no general increase in the tariff will be practicable and it will be impossible to adopt the remedy suggested. 4. Since the day when the above mentioned treaties were concluded the revenues of the Sultans of Muscat have steadily diminished owing principally to (1) the loss of their sea-power.and overseas dominions; (2) the introduction of steamers into the Persian Gulf and the abandonment of Muscat as an.entrepot for trade5 , ^ r I c+, ; W''r? ■' / ; | (3) the arrest of the prosperity of the country and its gradual impoverishment owing to the persistent drought in the interior, 5. In the last fifteen years, in particular, the general economic conditions of the country have deteriorated to an alarming extent. The date crop, the primary source of wealth has greatly declined in value as a result of the continued failure of the rains. Since the war ther'e has been a fall in the value of the country's produce generally, and a dep reciation, in sympathy with the silver market, of the value of the Maria Theresa dollar, the principal currency of Oman. Thus in 1922 the dollar exchange wasl reckoned at two hundred I rupees as against one hundred and tvfenty three rupees in ' ' I 1929. The recent depressed conditions of the pearl industry have also reacted unfavourably on the xinan^es of Muscat. 6.

To: Department of State, Concerning the increase in / Washington, tariff of the State of Muscat / Dated May 3rd, 1930. and Oman. / Pi V' 't'l- ^ ' N ^ '17 REFERENCE Foreign Office telegram of 26th April, 1930.qo / Letter from the British Embassy, Y/ashington, to the Secretary of State of the United States, Washington, No, 132, dated the Hay 3rd, 1930. I have the honour to inform you, under instructions from His Majesty^ Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the State of I'uscat and Oman, in South Eastern Arabia, with which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are in special relations, has suffered for a period of several years from a condition of increasing financial stringency, and a critical situation has now arisen which calls for an immediate remedy. After atach careful consideration of the problem, the Sultan and his advisers have reached to conclusion that an improvement in the financial position of the State can only be effected by an increase in the rate of the tariff on imported goods, and that it is important, in the interests of the prosperity and good government of the State, that this proposed increase should take effect with the least possible delay. The right of the Sultan of Muscat to raise the tariff of the State beyond a rate of five per cent, is, however, limited by Article 3 of the Treaty between the United States and Muscat of 1833, in accordance with which 'vessels of the United States entering any port within the Sultan^ dominions shall pay no more than five per cent, duties on the cargo landed'. Unless therefore the United States G-overnment will consent to Y /aive its rights under this treaty, no general increase in the tariff will be practicable, and it will be impossible to adopt the suggested remedy. In these circumstances the Sultan desires that the United States Government should be approached with a view to secure at the earliest possible moment such a waiver of its abovementioned rights as will alloy/ of a general increase in the Muscat tariff above the present flat rate of five per cent. Since the United States inte re stsinterests in Muscat are in charge of the Government of India's Political Agent, His Highness lias requested that His Majesty's Governnent should take up the matter with the United States Government on his behalf# Conditions have entirely altered since the .conclusion of the Treaty of 1333. During the intervening period the revenues of the Sultans of Muscat have steadily diminished, owing principally to (1) the loss of their sea-power and overseas dominions j (2) the introduction of steamers into the Persian Gulf and the abandon] ent of Muscat as an entrepot for trade; (3) the arrest of the prosperity of the country and its gradual impoverishment owing to the persistent drought in the interior. In the last fifteen years, in particular, the general economic conditions of the country have deteriorated to an alarming extent. The date crop, Oman's primary source of wealth, has greatly declined in value as a result of the continued failure of the rains. There has in addition heen a fall in the value of the country's produce since the war, and a fall in the value of the Maria Theresa dollar, Oman's principal currency, in sympathy with the silver market (in 1922 the dollar exchange was reckoned at two hundred rupees as against one hundred and twenty three rupees in 1929). Moreover the depressed conditions of the pearl industry in recent years have reacted unfavourably on the finances of Muscat, since Bahrein and Dihai are one of her principal markets. The following figures for the four years 1925-1923 show the progressive decrease in the customs receipts, which are, and must remain, Muscat's principal source of revenue s- •'V 1925 Es.' 774,410 1926 . . • .V The result of this steady diminution in the resources of the government has heen that, at a time when, if the State is to 'be administered in accordance with the changed conditions and improved standards of the present day, considerable increase of government expenditure is required, it has 'been necessary on the contrary to effect the most drastic economies, and to cut down expenditure to a figure at which it is no longer possible to maintain the administration even at its present level. To such an extent has restriction of outlay 'been essential that, for some years past, it &amp;as been necessary to eliminate from the budget all expenditure upon public works, and the Sultan has been unable to show to the important tribal Sheikhs of the interior the traditional hospitality which plays so important a part in maintaining his authority and prestige* This financial stringency is leading to an increasing deterioration of the efficiency of the administration and is exercising a marked effect upon the Sultan's control over the country. Indeed it may be said to be threatening the stability of the State. The problem of improving the finances of the State has therefore received the most attentive consideration and every possible means of remedying the situation has been examined by the Sultan and his native and European advisers. As a result it has become clear that the only course, which'holds out any prospect of success, is to increase the rate of the customs duty, and moreover that such a step should be taken with the minimum of delay. It is understood that an increase aft to eym a ^ cw- of the flat rate of five per cent^(except upon alcohol and cigarettes, on which a tax of fifteen per cent would be levied) is at present conteJnplated. It is scarcely necessary to point out that the rate of five per cent, fixed over three-quarters of a centmry ago is, in the light of modern tariffs, a very low one and that the new rates^/are moderate. His Hajesty's Government feel little doubt that, having in view the complete change of conditions, both in regardof) —■ regard to the revenues and economic resources of Iluscat and Oman, and in regard to the necessities imposed by the improved standaj^s and increased costs of modern administration, the United States Government will con sider the Sultan 1 s request as reasonable, and will agree to release him from the limitation upon the rate of the Muscat tariff imposed by the Treaty of 1833. Should the United States Government, as His Majesty's Government earnestly hope, be prepared in principle to consent to this modification of their treaty rights, the question of the best method of giving legal effect to the modification of the relevant position can be subsequently considered. The matter, I would again mention, is regarded as one of considerable urgency. i-'. I f.Lt n-i- 10 -pryHo.881. IPTER, Ho. BRITISH EMBASSY, WASHIHGTOE. qif \'i May 29th, 1930.

To turn to more local interests. On the analogy of Article 7, if the United States were on the same footing as His majesty*s Government, no export duties could be imposed by the State without their consent® we have not exercised our right to interfere with export duties, (which it may be noted meace up some 30^ of the staters revenues) &gt; 'but there is no guarantee that the United States Govern ment would follow our example. 4. Under Article 2-0 tne privileges of 'free and public exercise of all forms of religion, ana tne rignt to build edifices for religious worsnip', in Oman are given to British'subjects* If American citizens are to have the same rignts then American Missionaries here could presum ably hold open air religious meetings, ejad ouild churches where they pleased. American idissionaries, while sincere persons, have often more zeal than discretion and these i privileges in tneir hands amongst a backward and fanatic population such as tnat of Oman would be very liicely to lead to most regrettable incidents, while the fact tnat American subjects, in the absence of an American Consul, are under the protection of the Bri1&gt;±trh Consul, would still further complicate this aspect of the question.

Sir, With reference to previous correspondence ending V; ' with my despatch Ko. 881 of May 29th, 1930, relating to the raising of the customs tariff of Muscat, I hare the honour to report that Mr. Cotton yesterday expressed regret to me that it would 'be impossible to secure the ratification of any treaty giving effect to the desires of the Muscat Government without considerable delay. At the same time he could not conceive that the United States Government, about to raise their own tariff in so striking a measure, could possibly object to the action proposed in Muscat. Ke therefore suggested that the Muscat Govern ment should, if they saw fit, raise their duties in the manner suggested, in advance of treaty approval by the United States Government. Ke asked me whether I thought that this verbal notification should be enough to enable His Majesty's Government so to proceed, or whether I should prefer it in writing. 2. I said that as we were dealing with formal treaty rights I thought it would be preferable to have it in some form on paper. At the same time I thanked him for the helpful attitude of the State Department, viiich, I said, would bring material assistance to a small and remote, but suffering community. I thought that the interests at stake being so small the technical irregularity he was proposing might 'he Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., Et c ., etc •, etc •,might very possibly escape all notice. 3, Mr. Cotton said he would write to me accordingly. He thought he would probably say, in effect, that if Eis ^ajesty's Government or '''uscst chose to raise the tariff in advance of American treaty approval, the United States Government would see no reason to raise any protest* I have the honour to be, With the highest respect.

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs having consulted other Ministerial Departments concerned and having examined the question of commercial relations between France and Muscat, has the honour to inform the British Embassy that the French Government agrees to the miodification of Article 10 of the Treaty of 1844 between France and Muscat to permit the increase of customs duties as proposed by the Sultan of Muscat.

Revision of Muscat Treati es, French Treaty. (a) I quite agree that it would be preferaiols to obtain acceptance of most favoured nation tariff treatment rather than merely agreement to increases now contemplated. Alertative drafts posted by mail of 13th January, Political Agent has suggested possibility that French Government might regard 'Zakat' which is levied on dates brought down from interior for export as export duty. ^he power of increasing '^akat' proved effective means of bringing pressure on umani tribes inl920 and it is important that State should retain it. It is only levied at cost because State fias no power to levy it in interior, and in my opinion cannot be regarded as export tax but as land revenue. Its enhancement then did not evoke any protest from French. I do not therefore share Political .'gent's view. At the same time if provision could be made in French treaty as it has been in American for State to obiain power to impose export duty, it would be useful, and I have provided accordingly in one oi the .. a (b) American Treaty , Wording of last sentence of revised article 3 seems possibly to admit of wider interpretation than most favoured nation treatment and might he held to entitle American nationals to claim participation in »y concessions or J i ! J !■' f .H life 1 f |or privileges granted to British nationals. - f this is not so then I see no objection to clause as it stands, - ^ oro.er to safeguard our position regarding coal and oil concessions I suggest for consideration that Sultan*s undertakings of -RESIDENT- fr/l- ^ &gt;irt 1 Mayi 1902 and Februarv 1923 might be communicated to Unitea States of America, ■'mmCOOTISfENTIAL resideNC iMlf Si' /j/z/v Ho. ^ .(y Agency &amp; H.B«M f 8 Consulate, Muscat,the 6th January 1931. OO^flOcM iAw 1 To The Hon'ble the Political Resident ixi the Persian Gulf, Bushire. %/* / Memorandum^ /■ With reference to correspondence ending with my telegram No* 107 of the 26th December 1930, I have sub*- mltted the drafts to the Council vide copy of my letter to the Council, with enclosures, attached, and will communi cate their reply to you as soon as it is received. Draft A stipulates the specific maximum tariff rates of 7i on general merchandise and 15 % on alcohol and cigarettes, and B merely stipulates most favoured nation treatment*. The Council will most probably ask me to Cf^h how matjersfhave progressed with the United States. I rv] t \ Nit 1 ' iu. presume I can show them American Department of State letter &lt;1 of 4th October 1930. I have not yet done so as your for warding endorsement N0.622-S of 6th December 1930 was marked confidential. Could you please let me have a reply by telegram. DRAFTS A and B . 3. I have no remarks to make on a. With regard tb B. The phrase 'if a vessel of other nations 11 is not of course good English, but it appears in the original text* The two deletions are proposed since - if the French Govern ment obtain most favoured nation treatment - these passages would seem to be redundant. The substitutions explain themselves: probably some other phrase would do quite as well. / ^ / . / / X t-vlw-s. Ia. 4» Tlie drafts have been drawn up as applying to Franceo By the substitution of the words 'British' for 'French 11 they would apply equally well to Great Britain. I mention this point as ^ I am not quite clear how it is intended to deal with Article 6 in our 1891 Treaty. If the idea of a fixed maximum tariff as laid down in Draft A is finally adopted 'by France and United States, then presumably in Article 6 instead of the worda . - ^ V v s ^ ^ _«?not exceeding 5^% the words 'not exceeding on general merchandise and 15% on alcohol and cigarettes' will have to be substituted. On the other hand if the principle contained in Draft B - (which is also that of the American Draft submitted to the British Embassy under Department of State letter of .I^October 4th 1930) - is adopted, then I suppose Draft B&gt; or something similar* will have to be substituted in Article 6 for the first paragraph* 'His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted xxxxxxxxor citizens of the most favoured nation'. The rest of the Article could stand. BRITISH TRADE IInTERESTS . 5. Draft B gives the Muscat State fiscal autonomy with regard to duties on Customs Imports. (The question of Exports is considered below in paras 5 to 9)» It is for consideration whether this autonomy could be used to the detriment of British trade. I am not of opinion that there is any danger of this. The most favoured nation treatment clause prevents discrimina tion against British goods. The State can raise the Import Tariff to any extent it likes, and if too high a tariff were imposed doubtless there would be a dimunition in the import of British goods. But this would injure the State itself which can be trusted to exercise common sense in looking after its own interests. i ZAKAT AM) EXPORTS • 6. Even if the principles of Draft B are adopted control V V^over duties on exports is still secured to His Majesty^ '^VGovernment by Article 7 of the 1891 Treaty. The French ^ v Government would seem to have a similar, though not so 4 definite, control by Article 11 of the 1844 Treaty* 'The' i k t u w 1 3. ti-ade skall 'be perfectly free in the said territories, subject to the above mentioned duty and to no other'* The United States mil have a like control if their claim for the most favoured nation treatment is successful* 7* Ko export dues as such are levied 'by the Muscat State, but Zakat ~ general revenue tax - which for various reasons it is inconvenient, or impossible, for the State to levy inland is taken on goods exported from the ports* This is barely distinguishable from Customs Export dues, and pre- i \||v \ I sumably could be argued to be such dues by any foreign government which wished to do so* In other words if we retain the privilege of Article 7 - as far as control of export duties are concerned - we must share it with France and United States* • 8* The power of increasing Zakat is a formidable weapon in / the hands of the State against the tribes of the interior, and a penal Zakat, suggested by the Political ijgent and approved of by the Government of India, imposed by the State in May 19E0, proved effective in bringing the Omani tribeIs to reason. (Vide Government of India telegram No* 720 E-A of 13th May 1920 to your address)* At that period the United States had of course no control over export dues, and France was not consulted, either on the gr'aounds that - if any objections were made by the French Government - Zakat could be successfully differentiated from Customs dues on exports, or that the French Government were so little concerned with Muscat now~a-days that they would take no I notice of the matter* Ho objections, in fact, were received from the French Government* '.Kt* 9* The position will not be quite the same in the future* There will be two foreign Powers with control of export dk. dues instead of one, and by the recent revision of their treaties these Powers will have their attention dr§iwn towards Muscat* By his treaty with the Imam (vide Political Agent, Muscat 1 s telegram Ko*1990 of 7th October 1921 to you) the ( I | 1Sultaaa agreed not to raise the Zakat above 5^ But If the Omanis were on their side to break the treaty, the Sultan would of course be free to impose once again a penal Zakat • if thought advisable# Under new conditions however, before the State increase a Zakat it might have to ask permission of the French and United States Governments, which in any case would be a long and labourous process, and which it might be inadvisable to undertake♦ 10* By abrogating Article 7 of our 1891 Treaty with the Sultan, in so far as it concerns our control over exports* the United States on the basis of the most favoured nation treatment would - with ourselves - have no control over export dues# But the French Government would still have to be approached, and it would probably be inadvisable to draw their attention to the Powers they may possess under Article 11 of their 1844 Treaty already alluded to. The raising of the question of exports too would delay and complicate the main end we have in view: the raising of the import dues# I do not therefore suggest any action on this aspect of the treaty question, but in view of the considerable local importance which a penal Zakat may assume in time of emergency, I thought it as well to touch on it# GWADUR 11# The original proposal by the Financial Adviser to the Muscat State for an increase of import dues (vide his letter ITo#40, of 16th March 1929, para IV, forwarded ^under Political Agent, Muscat^s Ko.40-C of the 18th March 1929) excluded Gwadur for various reasons# There is no mention of this exclusion in the correspondence between the Government of India, His Majesty's Government and the French and United States Governments. It wasdoubtless more convenient to present the question of the tariff reform of the State as a whole, and whether the principle of Draft A or B is adopted the State can impose such lesser tariff at Gwadur as it thinks fit* ^ C ' Msg or* Political Agent &amp; Consul, Muscat.11 Article 10• i •p ' No duty exceeding 7^ per cent on general merchandise and 15 per cent on alcohol and cigarettes shall 'be levied on goods imported 'by Freeh vessels into the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat* Tf a vessel of other nations imports any goods into the territories of the Sultan of Muscat, and pays less duty than that already -4844^^1 a ted in this Article the same duty shall 'be levied on similar goods imported by a French vessel into the said jwCSuuL territories.

From - The Hon* hie Lt» Colonel H. •Biscoe,I #ii., Political esident in the Persian Gulf jo « The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Hew Delhi. Sir, In continuation of my telegram iiio.r.l, dated the 17th January 1931, I have the honour to forward herewith two rlternative drafts amending article 10 of the trench treaty of 1®44. 2 # ^raft (a) allows the Muscat State to impose a customs duty of 7^ on all goods except alcoholic liqueurs and tobacco, on which duty ma^ he raised to 13&gt;. jraft (h) allows the Muscat State fall tariff autonomy, ooth in respect of exports and imports, while according to the French*, most favoured nation treatment. Under the treaty of 1844 the Muscat Jtate have undertaken not to levy duty exceeding 5^ on goods imported in French Toottoms, but there is nothing to prevent the Muscat State levying any duty it pie- ses on French goods imported in vessels that are nou French, for instance by British India Ste/m Navigation Company steamers, provided the •..X ty* — the British Government do not object under Article 6 of the treaty of 1B91, A tariff based on the nationality of the Yessel in which the goods are imported instead of on the country of origin of the goods theiaselTes wo-JLd seem to be of little practical value to the i ?rench nowadays, and in the revised drafts I hare suggested that this should be altered, and that in future the duty fixed should be applicable to goods of French origin however imported instead of to the cargoes of French vessels. This would seem to be a possible lever to use to the French to indiice them to grant the Muscat State full tariff autonomy botn in respect of imports and exports, provided they obtain most favoured nation treatment in return. 5» In the revised draftfe) I have omitted the latter portion of Article 10 of the present treaty which deals with the charges to be levied on vessels as opposed to those which are levied on goods. This is not at present a practical issue since no harbour dues are levied at Muscat, and there is only one dhow at ^ur nowadays that flies the French colours, so if the French desire that these clauses should be retained, I see no serious objection. They are however, in my opinion, out of date and not in accord with present day principles or practice, and if at some future occasion the Muscat State desire to levy harbour dues to meet the cost of facilities provided it would seem desirable to obtain for them the power to do so. As long as they obtain the most favoured nation treatment in this respect wluch the treaty already grants them the^ would seem to have little ground of complaint.r -3- 6« It will be seen that the draft articles are on the analogy of the -.zaerican draft, hut the last sentence of Article i is omittecl in e: ch c&amp;se, since the French already enjoy most favoured nation treatment in respect oi all privileges accorded to other nationals under Article ii of their present treaty. 7 # I trust therefore that it will be possible to obtain an agre ment of the French Government to an amend ment of the treaty on the lines of draft (b) which will certainly be the more advantageous to the Muscat State. Firstly, it would permit of their raising the duties higher should they desire to do so on some future occasion and secondly, it authorises them to levy export duty. Moreover, although with their present somewhat primitive methods of administration a flat rate on all merchandise with the exception of liqueurs and tobacco is probably the most convenient form of tariff for the btate, in future years it may be to their advantage to vary the customs duty on different articles, and it is very desirable that they should have power to do so. q # in view of the present critical condition of the Muscat finances, 1 trust it will be possible to obtain the consent of the French Government and the United States of /merica to a revision of their treaties at an early date. i 9.

Extract from letter ^o.ll-C,dated the 13th Janry 1931, from the Political Agent, Muscat. x X X X X X Measures to meet the deficils , 4. It is clear that immediate steps must be taken to meet the financial crisis. These steps can be broadly divided into two part: (a) Economies in State Administration. (u) Raising of Revenue. Mr* Hedgcock and myself are closely considering (a) ana proposals will be submitted as soon as possible. I have seen the largest Merchant creditor Khan Bahadur TTassib who is owed about Rs.84,000. He is prepared to wait for his money; in fact there is no other course open to him. The other merchants ■Till also have to tid their time. 5. An important proposition under (b^ is that contained in the letter fro^ the Council quoted. above. The Council, pending their consideration of the revised treaties with France and America, ask His Majesty's Government for per mission to increase the import tariff rate at an earl,; 7 dace. This proposal has my support, and I venture to suggest that urgent permission to that effect be®sked _ or fr on Co'v e^. m^en ^ • The proposal in principle is the same as was dealt with in correspondence ending with your telegram ITo.^1^ of 3rd -aron 1930 t o the Political Agent, Muscat, and which was finally negatived in that telegram. The main argument which led to the dro^ ing of this proposal. — i. e• what i t mignt be mere difficult to obtain later the consent of the Powers concerned to an increase of tariff - no longer holds t-'ie same fo^ce. Both the Powers concerned, Prance and America have agreed in principle to the raising of the tariff. (Vi ^e letter from the ..»-2- the Foreign Office to the British Embassy, Paris, of 15th October 1930, and correspondence between the United States of State Department and the British Embassy, Washington particularly State Department* s letter, of May 23rd, June luth and June 11th 1930. The last named is particularly to the poi^t. Tariff of 10^. 6. It -will be noticed that the Council's applicsti on is for an increase up to 10/o and 25/o, instead oi tne Tjt/^ an^ 15$» originally proposed. Mr. Hedgcock informs me that rather than ask a 7-fc* rate in the first place and then find it in adequate he would prefer to ask for the 10,% increase^ even though further examination might justify the impositi ori of a rate lower than this. In this connection 1 would draw attention to the statement of the Council that they are prepared to be guided by the advice of the Political Resident. 7. If His Majesty's Government concur this proposal then it seems'to me that the simplest way to meet the request of the Council would be, with reference to Article 6 of i89i - Treatv, to grant a temporary and emergency permission for the tariff to be raised. But whatever may be the exac .• ftordin^ of the sanction it should in my opinion contai n the fo-^ owing stipulations: (1) Permission to raise the tariff on imports to 10/o on general merchandise, and 25% on cigarettes and alcohol- Note. If for any reason it is considered inadvisable to srant permission for the 10^ and , ! ~ n rate of 72% could be granted. (2) It should be understood that no tariff increase should be made on goods brought iri French and American vessels uending final agreement with these Powers. Hote. This stipulation is contained 4n the Council s own re -drafting of Article 6,'subject to his treaty obligations to other foreign Powers', and is necessary in ...ih / V in view of the State's comrnitments to France and America, As it Is only goods in French and American vessels to which, such commitments apply, and as French and American vessels never visit Muscat, there seems no reason why this stipulation should not be made. f The Muscat State and -niled States . 8# Though I have not yet approached the Council as to the United States' proposal for most favoured nation treatment, vide my letter 5-C of 6th January 1931, para 2, I think it is extremely probahle that the 8ouncil will have strong oTdj to this proposal, which in their eyes may appear as a demand for w something for nothing'• It is not unlikely that the Council will only be prepared to grant to the United States most favoured nation treatment only hs far us tan 0, —duties arj.: oncerned . (Any rights already held by the United States i n their Treaty of 1833 would of course ramain.) 9. It is necessary to consider whether the probability of the Council assuming this attitude should prevent His Majesty's Governkent fro^ giving the permission outlined in paras 6 and 7 above. I am not of opinion that it should. Having gi«en this permissi 0ri His Majesty's Government would be in the strong position of having inade a generous gesture to a small, weak and struggling State. France, having expressed her willingness in principle to the rise in tariff, and having al ready got equal rights with us in Muscat by b~er existing Treaty of 1844 would no doubt bo prepared to oe equally ^en^vi ous# If United States stand out they will appear ^' Le unenviable li,-ht of a big power pressing a small Power to get s o - netni ng which the latter is not prepared to give. 3 ' finally either the United States or Muscat give way, the situation resolves itself. If neither give way then goods borne in United States* vessels only pay 5/^, and united buates vessels never-4- come to Muscat. It is just possible that a United States 1 vessel ^ight be chartered to trade with 'Oman and so take advantage of the lower rates y b u t this is extremely unlikely. 10, As far as our interests are concerned I have already expressed my views, vide my letter Uo, 86-12 of loth July 1930, as to the effect on oar position in Muscat if United States were to get full most favoured nation treatment from the Muscat State* I have the honour to he.

To this end we would reciues -• i ou (l) To obtain H.B.M.G's sanction to a revision of the first sentence of Art.6 of the Treaty of 1891 to read as under: 'His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted, subject to his 'treaty obligations to other foreign powers, to levy a duty 'of entry n ot exceeding 10/1 on general merchandise and 25% on V 'alcohol and tobacco, on the value of all goods and merchan- Tdise of whatever description, imported by sea fro m foreign • ' tail 'countries iuto His Highness'dominions' •'2) To ask H.B.1I.C,. to allow the increased customs rates, as permitted under Art.6 as revised above, to be enforced pending the formal ratification of the suggest amendment to the Treaty of 1891.

This is what had to be aaid and salaams. kj Qripjinal on Pile ' ^Tc . 55/87 -7 01 e ) e » • t Extract fro in despatch No,7»T of 27th January 1931, to the foreign Secretary to the Govt.of India,New Delhi. x x x x x x x x x x xx x x x x x x When the position was pointed out to the Council 'by ; • Hedgcock, they addressed a letter to the &gt;olioical Agent in v/hich they stated that in their opinion the increases in trie customs duties originally proposed would not be adequate and asked that the rates should be raised to 10% on general merchandise and 25^ on alcohol and tobacco, but stated that in this matter they would be. prepared to be guided by my advice. To this end they have asked me (1) to obtain the consent of His Majesty's Government to a revision of the first sentence of Article 5 of the treaty of 1391 to read as followsi 'His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted, subject to 'his treaty obligations to other foreign powers, to levy 's. duty of entry not exceeding on general merchandise ' and 25/1 on alcohol and tobacco, on the value of all 'goods and merchandise of whatever description, imported 'by sea fro^r foreign countries into His Highness' 'dominions'. (2) to obtain the consent of His Majesty's Government to the introduction of the increased customs rates in anticipation of the formal ratification of the suggested amendment of the treaty of 1891. 7. The Political Agent, in forwarding this proposal, points out that goods imported in French and American vessels would still only pay 5^ until the treaties with these Powers had been amended, but as iifes. no French or American steamers call at Muscat ...10 ,.•. Muscat, in practice no preference would be given to ^rencn or American goods. The proposal however is somewhat similar to that contained in paragraph &amp; of India Office le'-ter Lc.P.^ 6567 of 27th November 1929 to the Foreign Office, and was o objected to by the Foreign Office for the masons given in par graph 3 of their letter No.2.6207/166/91 of 31st January 1930. From a perusal of those letters, however, it would seem that there was some misapprehension regarding ■■•*±6 position o^. -■ranee and the United States. Under its treaties with those Powers, the Muscat State cannot charge more than 5% on goods imported in ships belonging to them; there is net mug nev e v e v to prevent the State charging any rate of duty wnicu. tne^ choose on French or American goods not imported in French or American vessels, and as no French or American vessels of call at Muscat nowadays, the goods/those countries would not obtain any preferential rates, 8, Further, the situation vis-a-vis these two Powers has since dev^ed considerably, and they have both expressed their Y /illingness to a gree to an increase in the customs tariff# Moreover in his telegram ■■ o»^&lt; , - • ^ J 193'0( of whxch a copy was forv/arded to me under Foreign and Political Department endorsement !To,D-3444-lT/3C of 30th a±y i qjo ) , His Majesty* s Ambassador at Washington repoited ^ua-t the Under Secretary had written semi-ofTicially stalm^ tu^u, in the event of limited non -discriminatory increases being, made in duties on goods imported into Muscat, pending .nc conclusion of anew treaty with the United States, 1 ^ Department would probably not have occasion to protest. 9 Further, the French Government have agreed to the modification to Article 10 of the Treaty of 1344 between France and Muscat - vide note addressed by the Ministry for Forei- n Affairs to the British Embassy (copy of which was forwarded to me under Foreign and Political Endorsement No, F.225-N/29 of 10th December 1930Ktfjcj -I- 10. trust therefore that His® Majesty's Government will be willing to agree t o a i :Oj.if xcation of Article 6 of the Treaty of 1891, in tne sense desired by the Muscat State, or to go even lurtner and grant to the Muscat State full tariff autonomy, subject to most favoured nation treatment for British goods. The Sri uish Treaty would then be in harmony with the 'French and American treaties* 11. If the revision of the three treaties can be arranged at a very early date, say wi thin a couple of months, then it is probably not worth while authorising the State to raise its duties in anticipation, but if there is likely to be a long- delay, then I would urge that the State should be authorised to raise its tariff without having to wait till the negotiations have been completed, on goods other than those imp-orted in French or American ships. 12. The new situation which has been disclooed, and the desire which the Muscat State have now expressed to increase their customs duty to a larger extent than was originally contemplated have shown that it is necessary to obtain from the French Govern ment full tariff autonomy for the State and not merely permission to increase their customs duties by a fixed amount, I trust therefore, it will be possible to obtain their acquiesence to a revision in the sense of draft (b) forwarded with ray despatch No.l-T of the 17th January 1931, 13. As regards the rates which the Muscat State now contemplate I would prefer to defer a definite opinion regarding their suitability until I have had an opportunity of visiting Muscat. I propose, if possible, to proceed there at a very early date, and will then address the Government of India further on the subj ect. 14. T© sum up: There is no doubt that a serious situation has now been disclosed, and it is essential that prompt measures should be take to deal with it. I therefore recommend (i) ...16. . . » (1) that the State should be assisted to obtain an overdraft of half a lakh from the Imperial Bank of India to meet i'rrmediate requirements• (2) orders should be issued without delay for the reduction of the Sultan's allowance to Hs.5000. (3) that His Majesty's Government should agree to revise Article 5 of the Treaty of 1391 so as to ^rant the Muscat State full tariff autbnomy provided most favoured nation treatment is accorded to British goods, (4) that the French Government should similarly be asked to grant to the Muscat Stats full tariff autonomy in return for most favoured nation- treatment , and (5) unless the modifications of the treaties can be effected in the very near future, the State should be allowed to increase the rates in anticipation of the revision of the British treaty, on all goods other than those imported in French or American vessels, or as it is put in their draft'subject to their treaty obligations to other foreign Powers 0 .

We now confirm these objections as follows:- 2. consider that if possible most favoured nation treatment should be limited to Tarili only and ti^at the last sentence should be omitted. The draft confers on American nationals extensive rights which they do not enjoy under the present treaty. 3. We object especially to the inclusion oi the words (a) residence and establishment and (b) acui-inis oiati oix of justice in the las^ sentence. (a) would piesumably allow American missionaries or merchants to reside wherever Indian merchants are at present resident as iar example aur. 'T • ' ■ (A^This we could not agree to. (b) Alters article 9 oi the American treaty of 1833. American nationals do not at present enjoy extra territorial rights, but are subject to jurisdiction of muscat Courts.

My honoured and valued friend, As Your Highness is aware, in order to alleviate the financial situation of your State, it was proposed to enter into negotiations with the Crovemments of France and the United States with a view to obtaining their permission for Your Highness to raise the present customs tariff-rates imposed 'by the State. In order that this permission should be obtained a modification of the Treaties which the Muscat State has with these Powers was necessary# Your Highness in your letter dated v&gt; * Dehra Dun, the 12th Jam ad i Al Ula 1349 ( 6th October 19 30) gave authority to His Majesty^ government to enter into negotiations with the above-mentioned governments. g. His Majesty's Government desire to instruct their Ambassadors in Paris and Washington to approach the governments of France and the United States for a modification of the Treaties mentioned above as detailed in •...in tne urafts attached heremth ( mariced A and B ). In order to enaole the Ambassador b to ohtain the necessary modification they must possess full powers from Your Highness, and I enclose six copies of such a document for your signature. You will notice that the names and designations 01 the persons to whom you issue full powers is left blank. r rhis is for the reason that th© Ambassadors themselves may be away on leave at the moment of the signature of the proposed treaty, in which case the necessary signature will be made by their staff, and the name of the British Representative actually signing the treaty will then be inserted. 4, The place at which you sign the full powers document is also left blank, and should be filled in, JPresumably it will be Dehra Dun. 5, Your Highness will see from the draft treaties ( A and B ) that only a revision of the tariff-rates is contemplated giving the Muscat state the power to increase its tariff. 6, as much delay would be entailed if Arabic texts of the treaties were insisted on I am directed to ask Your Highness to be good enough to agree that the reaties should be drawn up in a single language i.e. French in the case of the Treaty with Stance and English in the case of the Treaty with the United States.

The revision of the existing Treaties is, however, a matter of considerable urgency, and in view of the fact that this point is unlikely to arise until a fairly advanced stage in the negotiations, the Secretarj'- of State would suggest that, if Mr. Henderson concurs, the draft despatches should issue without further delay, supplementary instruc tions being sent to His Majesty^ Representatives in Paris and at Washington when the Sultans reply on the question of language and on that dealt with in the following paragraph has teen received. The Under Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE. 3.3. As regards paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office letter, the Secretary of state agrees as to the desirability of procuring from the Sultan of Muscat the necessary Full Powers to enable His Majesty 's Representatives in Paris and at Washington to sign the necessary Treaties on behalf of His Highness, and he is requesting the Government of India to take the necessary step^ While the specimen Full Power enclosed in the Foreign Office letter under reply is, in his view, generally suitable^ he is inclined to think that it would be preferable to omit the word 'Royal ,, where it occurs in the draft, having regard to the facts that the Rulers of Muscat have normally in the past been styled 'Highness 11 , and, that the use of the word 'royal 1 * in their style has been avoided (though the United States of America Treaty of 1833 - unlike the French Treaty of 1844 - employs the terms 'Majesty' and 'Royal*)• As will be seen from the telegram of which a copy is enclosed, he is instructing the Govemment of India accordingly. 4* With reference to paragraph 5 of your letter, I am to enclose copy of a letter which is being addressed to the Dominions Office.

The question of the modification of the tariff provisions Cx the Treaty 01 1891 will not become a live one unless and until the concurrence of the French and United States Governments has 'been secured in corresponding modifications 0* their Treaties with Muscat • From the correspondence enclosed it will 'be seen that the Secretary of State has concurred in the instructions proposed 'by the Foreign Office to he sent on this subject to His Majesty's Representatives in Paris and at Washington, and that steps are being taken to secure from the Sultan of Muscat a Full Power to enable them to sign treaties on this subject on his behalf* If, as is hoped, the outcome of the negotiations with France and the United States is successful, it will then be necessary to consult the Dominion Governments concerned before steps can be taken for the modification of the British Treaty of 1891» As Mr. Secretary Thomas will observe, the matter is one of great urgency; it will be desirable to reach a decision on it with the minimum of delay in the event of France and the United States concurring in the proposals now to be put to them, and I am to suggest that in these circumstances it may be thought desirable to make a preliminary communication on the matter to ( copy forwarded to P.AtMuscat under P.L.No«548-S of 27th August 1931).Ho,F,225-H/a9. , A copy of the undermentioned paper is forwarded to the Hon^ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for intormat ion, in continuation of the endorsement from the Government of India in the foreign and Political Department Ko.F.225-N/29, dated the 20th July 1951. c\i By order,etc,, Assistant Secretary to the Government of India.
