I consider that It would be preferable to convey to the King of the Yemen as soon as possible the decision of His Majesty’s Government that the embargo upon the export of arms to his territory is now removed and that there is, consequently, no objection to his placing orders for arms with British manufacturers if he desires to do so. 3. !:y reason for preferring this alternative is the possibility of the King of the Yemen desiring to purchase munitions insnedlately from British firms, but of being still under an apprehension that any enquiry on his part might meet with a refusal. His indirect and tentative enquiries made privately of me through the Officer Comraanding Ta’iz during the Sa’uii war suggested this, especially as at that time there was no lack of supply from Italian sources. 4. i consider it advisable to disabuse the King of the Yemen of such an opinion in order both to counteract foreign imports into, and to encourage British trade with, the Yemen. As he was never formally notified of the existence of the embargo, I think His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonias, London.think it will be sufficient if Colonel Lake takes advantage of his impending visit to San'a to inform the Yemeni Government verbally of its removal. S. The prohibition to which you refer in paragraph 2 of your despatch was removed lamedlately on receipt of Colonial Office telegram No. 42 of 3rd May 1934. I have, etc., (3d.) B.R. Reilly.

Seeing that a Treaty of Friendship has now been signed with the King of the Yemen and that he has evacuated the Protectorate Territory which he previously occupied, we think that the embargo on the export of arms from this country to the Yemen should be removed. If the departments concerned agree to this course, we presume that the Board of Trade will take steps to withdraw the prohibition on the grant of export licences which has been in operation up to date.

I think you will find it self-explanatory. 2. Although it is now much more doubtful than it was whether the proposed Rome conversations will in fact take place, it is still possible that I may have to hurry out to Rome at the end of this week, and if so it would be extremely useful to have the fullest available information on the point I have raised. (it could if necessary be telegraphed to me at Rome.) Do you think you could therefore send a brief telegram to India asking for confirmation or otherwise of our impression that Ibn Saud has not received any supplies of this kind from India J. G.Laithwaite, Esq,r~ * f, 9, ‘W 4U India since the consignment sent to him under our auspices in 1929 at the time of the Mutair rebellion? Yours ever, Ik i V(S 6861/769/86 ror ioir o ick, s.-s.i. November, 1933 \ V My dear Cowell, As you cnov, it is oossible that we may in the very near l^ture have to embark on some informal conversations with the Italian Government about affairs in south-western Arabia. In connexion with those conversations, it may prove important for us to have some Idea of how far Ibn Baud and the Imam have obtained arms and munitions from British end Italian sources resneetively* 2. I understand that the Board of Trade have not issued any licences for the supply of anas to Ibn Sand frou this country for a very long time, so that we may take it, I think, that Ibn 3aud has got nothing from here. I do not think he has obtained anything from India, but I am asking haithwaite whether he can take any steps to get confirmation oi this. I have, however, somewhere seen a suggestion H. . owell, -sq., C.M.Osuggseetlon that Ibn Baud way have obtained arms from or through Aden, and that Champion told some local shipping firm (poseihly a firm known as Besse and Company; early in September that there was no reason why they should not transport each arms to Ibn Saud If they wished to do so. I believe Chamoion later informed the Italian Consul of this, and if so, this may account for the Italians having apmrently got an exaggerated idea of the amount of war material which Ibn Saud has obtained from, or through, British sources. 3. As the noint is of some importance, I should be grateful if, provided you see no objection, you could obtain from j den a brief telegraphic report indicating whether Ibn Saud is known to have obtained any war material of any kind from, or through, Aden, and if so whether that war material was of British origin, or whether the Aden authorities are aware of his having obtained any such material from other sources.4, At the sroite time it would be Tery useful if Aden could supply any information, whi ch cou ld If necessary be quoted in the course of our conTcraat &gt;ns ^ with the Italians , ne to the saount of arms, munitions or war material which the Imam is known to have obtained from Italian official or private sources either from Italy direct or through ritrea or elsewhere. 6. I am sending conies of this letter to Laithwaite at the India Office, and to McOlaughry at the Air Ministry.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002db_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2192</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002db</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2192</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 7/24 'Arabia: supply of munitions of war to King Ibn Saud and Imam of Yemen'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1936</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-09-27T22:51:50</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (56 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 56; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file consists of correspondence regarding the supply of arms and ammunition to Ibn Sa'ūd and the Imam of Yemen, in the context of the British policy not to favour either side in their territorial dispute. The principal correspondents are the India Office, the War Office, the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the Chief Commissioner of Aden (Bernard Reilly).The file opens with correspondence regarding the policies of HMG and the Government of India, and a confirmation that Ibn Sa'ud had not received arms from Britain since the 1929 Mutair rebellion. The embargo on transporting arms to Yemen is then discussed, as well as the decision that the embargo be lifted in order to maintain British impartiality. Correspondence with the Aden Chief Commissioner concerns the transport of arms, ammunition and troops from Aden to Yemen, and the application of the Indian Arms Act (1878) to Aden waters.The file contains a small quantity of correspondence with Lloyd's of London (insurance brokers) dated 1936, regarding permission to underwrite arms shipments to Hodeidah [Al Hudaydah] and Jeddah [Jiddah].The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Export controls</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imam of Yemen</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002db#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
