From H. Welghtman, Esquire, I.C.S#, Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to request that the following rep resentation may be forwarded to the Government of India with such comments as you may see fit to make and with the further request that it be submitted to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. 2. Under the orders contained in the External Affairs Department 1 s telegram No.. 572 dated the 31st March 1938 I have been informed that during the period that I was offi ciating as Resident in the Persian Gulf I should not come under the operation of Fundamental Rule 49 since it was in tended that I should perform only 'current duties', and that I should be granted additional remuneration at the rate of Rs. 300/- per mensem for carrying out those duties. The lat ter part of this order is presumably based on Fundamental Rule 35. 3. I have in fact officiated as Resident in the Persian Gulf from the afternoon of the 23rd March, when Sir Trenchard Fowle left for London, until his return on the morning of the 1st May — a period of 38 days. 4. I am unable to discover any definition in the Funda mental Rules or elsewhere of the expression 'current duties' but/-but Judging by the fact that the current duties of the post of the Resident in the Persian Gulf have in this instance been appraised at a value of Rs« 300/- per mensem it must, I sub- mit| be deduced that they can connote no more than the barest routine, involving the assumption of no greater responsibili ty than that of ensuring the continuity of such routine i.e. the rendering of returns, the passage of information, the main tenance of accounts and so on. 6. I have however received no intimation that such duties alone were expected from me during my officiating period; and I venture to suggest that it would be impossible for a post such as that of the Resident in the Persian Gulf to continue to exist for more than two or three days on such a basis. Nor indeed would any officer with the most elementary sense of res ponsibility consent to restrict his activities to such func tions unless he were directly ordered to do so. In an area such as the Persian Gulf it is patently impossible to expect that a period of close on six weeks can elapse without fre quent necessity for the exercise of the full powers and res ponsibility devolving on the Resident. That such occasions have in fact arisen during the past six weeks is evident from the records of the Residency; and it is, I think, unnecessary to argue at length that no officer in the position I held could nave delayed action on those occasions until the return of the permanent Political Resident or could have avoided exercising tfvt his own motion the full responsibility of the post. 6. The position is clear. The permanent Political Resident was on deputation in London for the purpose of negotiating a new Treaty with the Sultan of Muscat. I do not for one moment suggest/-3- 3 suggest that any responsibility in respect of that Treaty devolved on me; but in all other respects it was incumbent upon me to accept and exercise the full responsibility at tached to the post of Political Resident.« And had I attempt ed to evado it I do not doubt I should have incurred the ex treme - and justifiable - displeasure of the Government of India* ?• So far as I am aware, the salaries attached to the higher posts of the Indian Political Service bear reference more to the weight of responsibility falling upon their in cumbents rather than to the volume of work to be performed. Though the extra work which I have been required to dischar ge in the past few weeks has involved a very considerable increase in my office hours, I base my claim for reconside ration of the present orders less on that fact than on the incontrovertible truth that, with the sole exception of the matter of the Muscat Treaty, I was compelled to assume the full responsibilities of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. I assert most definitely that the proposition that I was responsible for 'current duties' only is untenable and I claim that I am entitled to the full benefits permissible under Fundamental Rule 49. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Political Agent, BahrainS. T?. 78. Claim for the payment of Overseas pay in England.

This form of memorial nas been chosen, partly because the Cathedral already contains a very lar£.e number of tablets and partly because the Ch aplain has assured me that the door-way is badly needed, and will be much used and appreciatedi and it was thought that • i^ajof liazalgette would have preferred this. The estimated cost of the djoor-v/ay duly inscribed s' is Rs.482/8/-, and you are invited to subscribe towards this amgunt. Subscriptions will be limited lc Rs.lC/- and it is recognised that those who knew him very little or had never met him, would be content to subscribe less than this.
