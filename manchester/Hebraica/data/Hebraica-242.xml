Seventeen leaves with text, and four flyleaves. The two outer flyleaves are brown paper, the inner flyleaves are blue paper. Foliated. The title page, in Russian, identifies the work as 'book which is called dream book, containing the interpretation of dreams in alphabetical order'. The table of contents (ff. 2r-v) is in Romanian. The main text (ff. 3r-17v) is in Russian, with notes in the inner and outer margins in Romanian. Cleminson describes the hand as 'late Balkan cursive'. Letters from the church Slavonic alphabet are combined with letters introduced as part of the gra≈ædanka alphabet in 1707. Each letter is followed by a list of items and topics with a brief explanation of what they would mean if featured in a dream. Gaster's signature can be found three times (ff. 1, 10 and 15). According to a note in blue pen (f. 17v) Gaster acquired the manuscript on 26 March 1884. A note in pencil on the first flyleaf reads: 'Dreambook, probably 17th Century'. However, there is a watermark, Kronstadt 1830.</dc:description><dc:language>rum</dc:language><dc:language>rus</dc:language><dc:type>Manuscripts</dc:type><dc:relation>Dreambook</dc:relation></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
