Dear Belgrave, You will remember my mentioning to you on the telephone this morning that the sons of Shaikh Muhammad request the use for their father of the title f, Amir' in letters of good offices issued by me when Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa goes on his travel; and you said that the title is not in use here and would hardly be approved of by His Highness. For me to use it on official documents would require more regularisation than a mere request from one of the Ruling Family that it should be used. 2.
