In his letter, Ryan makes comments on various aspects of the treaty, its wording, and Saudi-Yemeni relations.The second letter (folios 13-14), from Albert Spencer Calvert at the British Legation in Jedda to Sir John Simon, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated 30 July 1934, encloses a translated copy of the Treaty of Taif (15-27), a copy of an arbitration covenant between the Saudi Arab Kingdom and Kingdom of Yemen (folios 28-30), and copies of annexed, translated letters (folios 31-35).The third letter, sent by Chancery at the British Legation in Jedda to the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, dated 11 September 1934 (folio 37), includes the text of an article to be inserted into the Treaty of Taif, which was missing from the earlier text. A copy of a further letter (folio 39), addressed to the Foreign Office from the British Legation at Jedda, explains the accidental omission.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imam of Yemen</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Plenipotentiary to the Imam of Yemen</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy of Hejaz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Taif</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Saudi-Yemeni War (1934)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Taif (1934)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00001f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00001f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00001f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
