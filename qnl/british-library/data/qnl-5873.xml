There is no record of similar request having been made before, but our policy is to discourage any tendency on the part of Saudi Trade Agent at Kuwait and unofficial Agent at Bahrain (vide Residency Letters No. 60 T 16th Nov ember 1930 and 452-S 4th May 1939) to assume a more important status, which the flying of a national flag implies. 3. Under 1899 Treaty with Kuwait, decision to concede or refuse foreign representation there rests with His Majesty^ Government and as privilege of flying national flag is so far as we know usually conceded only to represent atives with diplomatic or Consular status, I suggest that request should be refused, especially as such concession may possibly present opening for similar request to be made in respect of Bahrain. 4. On receipt of your reply I propose to acquaint Shaikh with Position. If any concession is contemplated I should be glad of opportunity of consulting him before final decision is arrived at.

(T 8305/7809/377) 21 ot July, 1945 Dear Harrison, In your letter Ext. 2515/45 of* the 2nd June about the flying of the Saudi-Arabi&amp;n flag by the Sai*3i-Arabian Trade Agent at Kovyeit, you suggested a way of explaining to the Saudi Government why this could not be allowed. Unfortunately we do not think that the flying of his national flag by a Trade Agent without consular status could in fact be held to be contrary to international convention car custom, though it might well be contrary to the laws and regu lations of the particular country in which he was stationed. ' hal would not be so in the case of a foreign Trade Agent here, who would be allowed to fly his national flag without hindrance, whether he possessed consular status or not* We feel therefore that the only satisfactory way to handle the matter is on the basis of local r gulations. If there is a law in Koweit which prohibits the flying of national flags by foreigners without consular status, we could then tell Ibn saud that such is the case. If there is nn such law, then either one will have to be made or the Trade Agent, in common with anyone else, must be allowed to fly his flag. Incidentally, the more freely foreign flags are flown, the less is any special significance likely to attach to the flying of such by particular individuals. Tours sincerely, Sgd. R. Dunbar P./.K. Harrison, Esq., India Office.Ext. 2515/45 2nd June, 1945* Dear Wikeley, Would you please refer to the 'dLitlcal Resident *a tele- garams 1001-2 regarding the flying; of the Saudi-Arabian flag by the Saudi Ti*ade Agent &amp;t KoBrcit.

It is not a question of drawing attention to incident - which was pointed enough from other side - but of establishing position for the future. It is clear that Saudi Government does not regard local custom as sufficient reason for not flying a flag. If we take no action we shall almost certainly be faced with a repetition. these circumstances appears to be thought pointed action but as local custom is not sufficient you should again approach shaikh and secure his agreement that he will issue a prohibitory order after a period of time has elapsed.

There Is no local prohibition at Kuwait but Shaikh* confirms that flying of foreign flags at Kuwait by other than accredited representative of Great Britain is contrary to loca custom and has stated that he is unwilling to agree to flying of 3audi flag by 3audi Trade Agent. Trade Agent flew Saudi flag for first time on occasion of Id on September 7th and Shaikh belxavos he would not have done so without orders from Saudi Government. 3 Shaikh is prepared to issue prohibitory order provided refusal of Ibn Saud's request is not based on such order as ne fears this would embitter his relations with £ a u d * He would issue order after Ibn Saud has been iniormed that flying of Saudi flag by Saudi Trade Agent would contravene established local custom. 4 I can appreciate Shaikhs difficulty and his attitude, and suggest that (a) I&amp;n baud’s request be refused on the ground stated in my immediately preceding paragraph and (b) prohibitory order be issued by Shaikh after a reasonable interval. Further, in our reply on (.) it be mentioned that action of Trade Agent on occasion of Id, wtule tne question of flying a flag on Fridays was still under consideration, was incorrect. cj As regards other Shaikhdoms. I suggest tnat similar prhhlbitory order be iss’idfe by Bahrain Ooverivient simultaneously with issue of order by Snaikh of ^wait. I do not recommend issue of order by Trucial Shaikhs including Qatar. Ibn Saud has no Trade Agent In this area and it ls niUKaly that he will appoint one. Further such action by these comparatively petty Rulers would not only undoubtedly affront Ibn Saud bpt Bulers themselves would probably be most reluctant to ls»ue such order. ibn Saud has no Trade Agent in Muscat. should one be appointed in the future and a similar request oe made oultan, as sovereign ruler, would almost certainly insist on - direct with the Saudi Government. In view of sultan s objection to flying of flag by our service stations it is most unlikely that he will accede to any such request. Moreover he mi^t not welcome advice from us on the subject. I do not therefore recommand any action. GAI.XOWAY'v_ Telegram From l 1 o Repeated No. Dated Q. , India Office, London. H.M. Minister, Jedda. No. 521. Political Resident, at Bahrain.

Shaikh is extremely reluctant to issue the proposed notification on the grounds that Ibn Saud would consider it directed against himself and would inevitably take offence. In spite of prolonged discussions I have not been able to get him to alter his view. 3. In my opinion he would issue a notification only if the request were so phrased as to be tantamount to an order and then under protest. If his resentment were aroused in this way he might cause difficulties when the question of allowing passage to foreign aircraft under the Chicago air agreement is raised. 4.
