The State Engineer reports that the Exchange operator on duty at the time has been examined and has denied being asleep or absent at the time. However, in order to ensure that in future there is no delay at the Manama Exchange the Bahrain Government have taken the following further steps (1^ between the hours of 4 p.m. and midnight two operators will be on duty instead of one as at present (2) between the hours of midnight and 8 a.m. the single operator on duty will ring up the power house every 3 minutes. 3* The State Engineer suggests that, when communication between Jufair and the Exchange is delayed or unachievable, the fault does not necessarily lie with the Exchange. He says that on several occasions the Bahrain Government electrician, on visiting Jufair when the Exchange could not establish communi cation, has found the wrong plug inserted, the receiver off, or some other mistake of that nature. As recently as June 17th when the Bahrain Petroleum Company wanted Jufair, the Exchange could not establish the connection for 20 minutes. Jufair reported no ring and stated that their private exchange was ^sticking”. The State Engineer reports that, on investigation, nothing was found wrong and he thinks that this was probably another case of wrong operation by the Base staff.- 2 - 4.

Instances have occurred where Shippers, Merchants, Contractors, and others receiving indents, specifications, and orders for goods described merely by reference to letters and numbers contained in the Company s Catalogues, have quoted for or supplied the goods of other manufacturers under the said letters and numbers. The Directors of the Company have been advised that such action is a fraud upon the Company’s rights, and have been successful in obtaining an injunction and damages in proceedings taken in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. The injunction restrained (inter alia) the use or employment m connection with electrical goods not manufactured or supplied by the Plaintiffs, of letters or figures having reference to the Plaintiffs’ Catalogue, so as to induce the belief that such goods are manufactured or supplied by the Plaintiffs, While inviting all persons engaged in the electrical trade to make frequent reference to the Company s Catalogue as a standard work on electrical materials and goods, the Directors feel bound to issue this warning against an improper use of the Catalogue. 3.—GENERAL.

The cast-iron case is strong and well finished, particular care being taken to make the joint between the case and lid flame-proof as well as watertight. The flanges are one inch in width and machined so as to cool effectively any hot gases escaping as a result of an internal explosion. The cover is securely bolted to the case. The internal unoccupied space is kept down to a minimum so as to limit the amount of explosive gas which might accumulate. The equipment comprises :— Four-Magnet Tropical type Generator armature wound to a resistance of 30(1 ohms and fitted with strong handle working through a flameproof and watertight gland. Polarised Ringing Movement wound to a resistance of 1,600 ohms and fitted with 6 -inch gong. The bobbins are wound with enamelled wire. Solid Back Long Distance Transmitter fitted to an iron chamber on the front of door, the diaphragm being protected from damage by a fine-meshed brass gauze. An induction coil wound with enamelled wire is fitted inside the ease. The i-esistance of the primary is 1 ohm, and of the secondary 25 ohms. Double Pole “ Bele ” Receiver wound to a resistance of 120 ohms. This receiver is fitted inside the case and is arranged so as to revolve when the listening tube (which is fitted on the left-hand side) is lifted to the ear. At the diaphragm end of the receiver a cam is fitted. This revolves with the receiver and at the same time operates the switch springs controllim? the speaking battery and receiver circuits. The gland through which the tube passes is flameproof and watertight. Two No. 2 G.E.C. Dry Cells are fitted on the inside of the door by means of a metal band. Attached to the bottom of the case is a chamber which contains strong and well-designed line terminals. Four lugs are fitted on the sides and back of the instrument for fixing. Result Of Test. -The Mining Department of the University of Sheffield carried out the following test on one of these telephones : 1 he casing of the apparatus was filled with the most explosive mixture of fire-damp and air, and this mixture was ignited by a secondary discharge from an induction coil whilst the apparatus, assembled as for use, was surrounded by a similar explosive mixture. Under these conditions of test, flame did not pass from the apparatus to the explosive mixture outside which remained unignited ; nor did the apparatus suffer damage due to the pressure developed within it.

Operation To call a station, say 37, the caller removes his receiver from the switch hook and listens for the dialling tone, which will be heaid as soon as the receiver is placed to the ear. He then dials, i.e., he places the tip of a finger in the hole through which the fig. 3 appears, pulls the rotating dial front in a clockwise direction until the finger stop is reached and lets go. The dial will immediately return to its normal position. He then places his finger in the hole through which the fig. 7 appears and repeats the operation. After dialling, a ringing signal is heard indicating that the called station is being rung. The bell at the called station rings intermittently. When the called station answers, the ringing current is automatically dis connected, the ringing tone ceases, and the two stations can then converse. At the end of the conversation, when the calling station hangs up his receiver, the connection is automatically released. Should the called line be engaged, the caller receives a busy tone in his receiver. Batteries.—The necessary current is supplied by a 24-volt accumulator battery. Unless otherwise specified, duplicate batteries are supplied so that one can be on charge while the other is in use. Power Panel.—Where D.C. supply is available a suitably equipped power panel is supplied to control the charge and discharge of the batteries through a resistance.

SYSTEM OF STREET A EAR MS AND TELEPHONE l J OSTS. As supplied to Tottenham, Harringay, Penge, Finchley, Dublin, Hampton, St. Anne’s-on-Sea, Partick, Brighton, Hendon, Southgate, Margate, etc. # This system of street fire alarms comprises street alarm and telephone posts, and special annunciator switchboard for the fire station. The posts contain fire alarm pulls to be operated by the public in the event of fire, and street telephones for the use of fire brigade. These telephones can also, if required, be used as police telephones. The annunciator switchboard receives calls from the street posts ; indicates from which post the call is given ; discriminates between genuine and accidental calls such as “ earths,” etc. ; and allows of the lines being tested. When pull in post is operated, the battery current passes through a corresponding indicator drop, along the line to post, and through bell to earth ; the indicator at once drops, closing the local alarm circuit, and the bell in post rings at the same time. The fireman attending in watchroom inserts his answering plug in the spring jack underneath the fallen shutter, and the dis criminating buzzer at once emits a long buzzing sound. If the alarm were caused by an “ earth ” on line the buzzer would not operate, and brigade would not be called out unnecessarily. If on inserting the answering plug the discriminating buzzer does not operate, it indicates either that someone wishes to telephone, or that the line has become earthed and requires attention. The attendant can ascertain which by listening on the telephone and making enquiries. After calling out brigade, the attendant withdraws the answering plug, and inserts in its place a plug belonging to the control indicator. This stops bell ringing in post, and the control indicator pointer is deflected to the “ on ” position. The answering plug is now available to receive further calls. When the post-handle is replaced, the control indicator returns to “ off ” position, and control bell rings continuously until plug is withdrawn and placed in its normal position. The attendant should now insert his answering plug, and listen on telephone to ascertain if the person replacing pull wishes to speak. To test lines from Station, the answering plug is inserted in each spring jack successively and the generator handle turned. If line is in proper order, the discriminating buzzer will be actuated, but if line is broken, buzzer will remain silent. This is a most useful adjunct, as it enables lines to be tested as often as may be deemed necessary. The apparatus in the post is extremely simple. The pull movement is replaced by pressing a small lever on the side of telephone. To communicate with fire station it is only necessary to hold receiver to the ear, and await reply The above description deals only with fire alarms, but the desirability of connecting the police station, turncock or other officials to the fire station is suggested. v.-'-W-Av' ' ■/ ' T ‘jfeA'&lt; -'I.'*,-.;Fire ^Brigade Alarms. Street Posts. The two illustrations show types of street fire alarm posts as installed at Tottenham, Penge, Finchley, etc., which are recommended to the notice of all District Councils, Borough Surveyors, etc. The method of operation is both simple and reliable. The posts stand about 5-ft. out of the ground, and are supplied with root. K 9 3 1 0 \h fitted with the following apparatus :— Locking pull to be operated by the public. Vibrating bell which rings when the pull is operated and continues until call has been attended to. Replacement movement for the pull. Substantial telephone receiver. Watertight solid-back transmitter. Induction coil. Switch hook. Line terminals. Two-microfarad condenser, which is used in line tests. K 9 3 / 5 is not fitted with any telephone, but plug holes are provided for connecting portable telephones carried by the fireman or policeman. Such separate pocket telephones are very useful, not only for firemen when attending a fire, but also to inspectors, who should make periodical tests of all street posts. The tests can be easily carried out without any pre-arrangement or fear of calling out brigade. K 9 3 / 5(K) 1620 FIRE ALARMS. Fire Brioade Alarms. l'im; A i.ar.m Switchboards.

If you do not see any objection, I should be obliged if you would sanction a separate telephone for the I.A's court which is considered to be essential for various reasons. ?.r.cThe charges of this new telephone (Rs 150/- per annum) will, like all other expenses incurred in connection with the new court room, be recovered from the Residency.
