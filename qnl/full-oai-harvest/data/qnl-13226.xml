Under each subject heading, the subject number, file number and title of the file is listed.A note at the front of the volume (folio 2) states the Senior Record Clerk at Bushire was responsible for the index, and that files marked blue ‘B’ were those transferred to Bushire, files marked red ‘C’ had been permanently closed, and those marked with a red cross had been destroyed. There are various annotations in red, blue and black pen throughout the volume’s lists. These annotations include: files marked as ‘destroyed’ in the right-hand margin; handwritten corrections to typewritten file titles; and red annotations at the bottom of each subject list indicating the last subject/file number used by the main office. Under these latter annotations, in some subject lists, there are additional typewritten file entries, presumably of new files opened after the creation of the index.There is no indication of the date that the index was created, with the exception of one annotation that is dated 15 January 1948 (folio 14).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100022598733.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
