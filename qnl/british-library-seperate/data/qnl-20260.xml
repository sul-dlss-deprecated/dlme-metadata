It further notes that the garrison at Karrack has been re-enforced, and that more troops have been ordered to Bushire from Shiraz. It therefore notes that the British should expect resistance to any attempt to occupy Karrack.It is stated that the Persian authorities at Bushire remain outwardly friendly towards the British Residency, and that the Resident will do all in his power to maintain his position there. It does however contain a request for advance notice of any proposed move against Karrack, so that he may take measures to move the Residency to a more secure location; the Resident favours Kowiet [Kuwait], which is under Turkish control.It is noted that the naval squadron in the Persian Gulf is not currently strong enough to overawe the local Persian authorities at Bushire, though it recommends stationing it at Karrack if the island is taken; it is noted that this will not interfere with its duties on the Arabian Coast. The letter further states that the squadron will not be employed against Bushire except in cases of extremity, and not without the permission of the Bombay Government.The item has two enclosures:1. Copy of a dispatch from William Taylor Thomson, HM Chargé d'affaires at the Court of Persia, at Tehran, dated 14 November 1853.The enclosure explains that diplomatic relations between Britain and Persia have been broken off, as a result of a dispute over the nationality of Hajee Abdul Kerreem; the British argue he is a British subject, while the Persians argue that he is a Persian subject.It explains that such a course of action may have to have been taken regardless, in consequence of the Shah's decision to side with Russia against Turkey. It advocates that the British have been presented with the opportunity to check the policy of the current Persian Government.It also explains that the envoy has lost the services of the Meerza's [Mīrzā], as a result of illness, and death; he may have to appoint Meerza Fuzl Oollah as a replacement.It is noted that this dispatch has originally written in invisible ink.2. Copy of a dispatch from William Taylor Thomson, at Tehran, dated 14 November 1853.The enclosure is informing the Resident that in consequence of an apprehended attack on a courier on route to Bushire, the Envoy has sent his dispatches for the Government of India via an alternative route.This dispatch contained enclosure No. 1.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x00001e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
