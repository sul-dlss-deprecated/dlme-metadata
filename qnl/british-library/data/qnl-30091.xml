Mr. de Bunsen to the Marquess of Salisbury.—{Received August 5.) (No. 426. Confidential.) My Lord, Constantinople, August 1, 1898. I HAVE the honour to transmit a translation which I have obtained privately of a Petition recently presented by Count Kapnist, nephew of the Russian Ambassador at Vienna, to the Ottoman Minister of Public Works, applying for the Concession of a railway from Tripoli, in Syria, to the Persian Gulf. The course of the proposed line is not quite clearly shown in the document, but as a right of preference is demanded for constructing branch lines to the north from Homs and Miadin (Meyadin), it would seem that it is intended to take the line through those two places. From Miadin its course seems to lie in the general direction of the Euphrates as far as Nedjef, whence there is to be a branch for Kerbela and Bagdad. The line is to terminate at Koweit. Preferential rights are reserved for an extension from Bagdad to Mosul and Diarbekir. In the conversation with Dr. Zander, Director of the Anatolian Railway in Constantinople, of which I sent a summary to your Lordship in my telegram No. 153, Confidential, of the 30th ultimo, I inquired of that gentleman what he thought of this scheme. He said his Company were, of course, watching it, but that they did not regard it as a very serious proposal, or one that was at all likely to be carried out. Mr. Marinitch, Acting First Dragoman, hears, however, that the Russian proposal is backed by French capitalists; that it is favourably viewed by a number of influential persons at the Porte ; and that the Russian Embassy will be instructed to support it. It is understood that Count Kapnist has waived his demand for a guarantee, and is now ready to build the line without one. I shall have the* honour to report further to your Lordship on the subject of Dr. Zander’s proposals by next mail. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) M. DE BUNSEN. Inclosure in No. 1. Petition. (Translation.) I REQUEST that a Concession may be granted to me for the construction and working of a line of railway from the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Bassorah, with a 6 per cent, guarantee from the Imperial Government, and upon the. following conditions:— I* The building and working of a line from Tripoli, in Syria, to Koweit, on the Fersian Gulf, the line to be built to admit of a speed of 60 kilom. per hour; the building of a branch line starting from Hanekin, on the Persian frontier, passing through Bagdad and Moussaib (on the Euphrates) to Nejf and Kerbela; and the construction of ports at Tripoli, in Syria, aud Koweit. 2. The right of preference for the building and the working of the following (a.) From Homs to Aleppo. (/I.) One from Miadin, passing through Deir northwards. (y-) One from Bagdad to Mosul and Diarbekir. (o.) One from Koot-el-Amara, on the Tigris, as far as the Euphrates, along the bank of the Shat-eLHadi. (e.)

I HAVE had the honour to receive your Lordship’s telegram No. 13, Com mercial, of the 1st instant, informing me of the financial position of Messrs. S. Meger and Co., who are interested in Count Kapnist’s railway scheme, and desire that their respectability may be vouched for if inquiries are made. I shall bear this information in mind, but I venture to remark that the under taking in question, of which some account is given in Mr. de Bunsen’s despatch No. 426 of the 1st August, is a very far-reaching one, extending over regions in the development of which British trade is deeply interested, and that it is likely, if carried out, to come in conflict with other railway projects for reaching the Euphrates and Persian Gulf, which would be more favourable to the British interests involved. I understand that a plan is now on foot for completing the Haiffa Railway to Damascus, and carrying it eventually across the desert to Bagdad and Basrah. It is too early to say whether this particular British enterprise is worthy of encouragement. But, if there is to be railway communication with the Persian Gulf, it would seem undesirable to leave it to be carried out by a Russian Company which leans on its own Government, who would reap the political advantages, for support, but seeks the necessary capital in England. 1 am informed that between 12,000,000/. and 20,000,000/. would be required to complete Count Kapnist’s scheme. The Porte is understood to be resolutely opposed to granting kilometric guarantees in future. The financial success of the project is therefore more than doubtful. Its promoters would perhaps be satisfied if it attained the political result of keeping British Companies out of the field. I should hesitate at all events to encourage British participation in it until we know more of its scope and results. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. No. 2. Sir N.

PRESENT that Germany con- in the Persian Gulf The recent statement templates seizing a port lTUir '■ m order to obtain a coaling station on the wav to China, although absurd in itself, is yet worthy of attention at the present moment. For although the idea of a coaling station so far removed from the ocean highway to the East is ridiculous and although German trade and influence in the Gulf are, at the present time, almost m7, yet there are other and far more important things to be taken into consideration before we reject the statement as unworthy of notice. I shall first of all endeavour to show approximately the value of German trade with the Gulf—including Muscat—for the last three years ; and I shalfl by comparing German with Rritish trade conclusively indicate what an overwhelming in terest we hold at the present day as compared with not only Germany, but all the rest of the world put together. For this purpose it is neces sary to lump all the Gulf ports, including ports cn the Pirate Coast, into one table, and to place Muscat into a second, and Mohammerah into a third table. With Bussorah 1 shall not deal, owing to its being a Turkish port, and there being no available statistics. The trade of Germany with Bussorah cannot, however, be very great, as no German Consul is stationed there to guard the interests of his countrymen, and I do not think that any G erman firm is established there. The following tables of comparison will, with a little thought, explain themselves. First comes the year, next conies G erman trade for that year, then British trade (which includes British-Indian also), then the trade of the remainder of Europe, and last of all is stated the whole volume of trade with all countries. From this it is very easy to compare German with British, and both w ith the total. It is as well to state that although these figures have been compiled from Consular reports, yet it is not at all unlikely that German goods which have come through foreign countries have been credited to .those countries instead of to the country of their origin, so that it would perhaps be as well to study the tables with a certain amount of caution.

HIS VIEWS ON ASIATIC PROBLEMS. Opinion? on the Frontier Policy. The Hon. George Nathaniel Curzon, M. P., whose selection as the next Viceroy of 1 ndiu has been announced, is the eldest son of the Rev. Alfred, Baron Scarsdale, a country clergyman. He was educated at Eton, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he formed one of the band of brilliant students attracted by the powerful personality of Dr. Jowett. He made his mark as a speaker at the Union Society s debates, and afterwards as president of that famous Club. He graduated in 1884, took his M..V. in 1887, and was elected to a fellow ship of All Souls. At the general election of' 1886 he was returned for the Stockport Division of Lancashire, which he has continued to represent in Parliament. But it was ever to the East that his eyes were turned, and about 1884 he planned a great scheme of travel in the Orient to examine on the spot the dilferent aspects of the Asiatic problem, the greater portion of the succeeding years, up to 1892, were devoted to this self-imposed task. By travel and diligent study he has become one of the first living authorities on Eastern topics, and his ex periences and opinions have been embodied in volumes which are standard works upon the sub jects with which they treat. In 1889 he published “ Russia in Central Asia,” an exhaustive analysis of the Central Asian problem, and of Anglo-Russian relations, especially in reference^ to India : in 18!i2 his monumental work on Persia ; and in 1894 “ Problems of the Far East—Japan Korea, and China”—which was revised and a chapter added on the Japanese and Chinese War two years later. He also published last year, under the auspices of th; Royal Geographical Society (whose gold medal has been awarded to him), a valuable monograph on the Pamirs and the sources of the Oxus, embodying the results of his own explo rations. What he had done for Russia in Central Asia and Persia, the countries upon the west of India, Mr. Curzon hoped to do for Siam and the French possessions in Indo-China. All his travels impressed him with the surpassing importance of the position of India in Asia, which he expressed in his own words thus As I proceed with this undertaking, the true fulcrum of Asiatic dominion seems to me to increasingly lie in the Empire of Hindustan The secret of the mastery of the world is, it only they knew it, in the possession of the British people ” He qualified for this further work by travel ’ in these little known countries, and a few detached newspaper and magazine articles from his pen were regarded as the precursors to another solid volume, but the pressure of public work, and the etiquette of the position he has held in the present Ministry, have delayed the completion of this project. Similarly,, m 1894, Mr. Curzon traversed the North-Western Frontier of India, visiting Chitral and the Ameer, and wrote a valuable series of letters for the Times His published works are so full and detailed that they form a complete index to his views upon everv vital problem of the I ar East. I’i 1891-92 Mr. Curzon held office as Under secretary of State for India, his chief being Viscount Cross. In 1895, on the resumption of office by Lord Salisbury, he became Under secretary for Foreign Affairs, which office he has held ever since. He did not have a seat in the Cabinet on either occasion. In 18 Jj he married Miss Leiter, daughter of Mr L Z. Lai tor, of Washington. He was born in 1859. IIIS VIEWS ON THE FRONTIER QUESTION. Mr. Curzon's views upon the Frontier Ques tion have been clearly indicated in his published writings but they were enunciated with un compromising clearness and vigour in the debate upon the policy of the Government m he House of Commons on February loth of this V ea : * The debate turned largely upon the occupation of Chitral, and m defence of the decision to remain in occupation he saut . xvm a iv.uuv '■v 1 ' ;i ' , ' m '' 'y - ■■■■'■ In the same way, I hold tb desires to keep her agreet have been almost impossibl a gap on our side.

A REVIEW OP THE PRESENT SITUATION. The recent statement that Germany con templates seizing a port in the Persian Gulf “ in order to obtain a coaling station on the way to China,” although absurd in itself, is yet worthy of attention at the present moment. Por although the idea of a coaling station so far removed from the ocean highway to the East is ridiculous, and although German trade and influence in the Gulf are, at the present time, almost nil, yet there are other and far more important things to be taken into consideration before we reject the statement as unworthy of notice. I shall first of all endeavour to show approximately the value of German trade with the Gulf—including Muscat—for the last three years ; and I shall, by comparing German with British trade, conclusively indicate what an overwhelming in terest we hold at the present day as compared with not only Germany, but all the rest of the world put together. Por this purpose it is neces sary to lump all the Gulf ports, including ports cn the Pirate Coast, into one table, and to place Muscat into a second, and Mohammerah into a third table. With Bussorah I shall not deal, owing to its being a Turkish port, and there being no available statistics. The trade of Germany with Bussorah cannot, however, be very great, as no German Consul is stationed there to guard the interests of his countrymen, and I do not think that any German firm is established there.

It is as well to state that although these figures have been compiled from Consular reports, yet it is not at all unlikely that German goods which have come through foreign countries have been credited to .those countries instead of to the country of their origin, so that it would perhaps be as well to study the tables with a certain amount of caution. Another thing that deserves a word of explanation is the apparent decrease of trade to Persian Gulf ports proper during the last year. This has been caused mostly by the very unsettled state of the country which followed the death of the Shah of Persia, and also by the fact that for several seasons the rainfall was a failure. These, combined with other causes, contributed to a state of unrest which resulted in many disturbances, and for a prolonged period the roads were quite unsafe. The prevalence of plague in India, and the imposition of quarantine on all arrivals thence, had a most depressing effect on the general state of trade, and naturally bore very heavily on British-Indian trade in particular.

The trade of Germany is in comparison utterly insignificant, and her flag is, to all intents and purposes, non-existent. Although her trade may be slightly more exten sive than the foregoing tables show, because she may come in under the title of “ other countries,” still it cannot be of any great value as compared with ours. There is at the present time only one German firm established in the Gulf, and that was reconstructed from the ashes of a firm (German) that failed in Bushire some time ago. This .firm is not as yet doing very much business, although it is reported to bo well backed up. There is also in the whole of the Gulf but one Consular Agent for Germany, and he is also stationed at Bushire. The appointment of this gentleman, or at least his arrival on the scene of his labours, is of very recent date. As he arrived in Bushire last November, and when one remembers that there are probably not more than about half-a-dozen German subjects in the Gulf, the appointment of a well-paid official to such a port is a matter for reflection. Of one thing there can be no doubt, that the Germans are making great efforts to obtain a footing in the Gulf, and probably it is simply part of one great scheme w'hieh aims at the Gcrmaniz'ation of the whole of Asia Minor. It is a matter of common knowledge that the German Emperor has made great efforts to make himself a persona grata at Constantinople, and that by a judicious system of flattery, mingled with slight concessions to Abdul Hamid at a time when concessions of any sort were exceedingly soothing to the Sultan’s amour propre, he has succeeded in his design, and the Germans are, therefore, in much better odour at Stamboul than any other nationality. They have for some time past been making headway with the railway line which they intend to construct to Baghdad, and which they hope to extend eventually to Bussorah, and which will—if once finished—make the influence of Germany supreme throughout Asia Minor, and would leave her in the position—should the Turkish Empire como to grief—to demand the hole of that fertile country as her lawful share of the spoils of division. Now the value of the country in question is very great, and it only requires the presence of a civilising power to develop into one of the greatest producing countries of the world. Of course, Germany knows this full well, and we have also known it for many years past; and we know it when we foolishly gave up the concession ive had obtained to construct a line through those regions nearly half a century ago. There can bo no doubt that if Germany aims at eventually extend ing her line of railway to Bussorah, the possession of that port would be a source of great strength to her, as it -would insure her the control of the whole trade of Asia Minor, as in that case no nation would be in a position to compete with her. The trade of Bussorah is already very great, and in the hands of any docent Government it would quickly develop into one of the largest ports in the East. In spite of the policy of the Turks, who do not wish the port to develop too much, and who are morbidly jealous of anything done by us either there or anywhere in the vicinity, Bussorah is a port with a large and steadily growing trade. If, as there seems little reason to doubt, this is the port that our friend in the Vienna Pan-Ger manic Conference had in his mind’s eye, it is to be feared that he is doomed to disappointment, for it is much to be doubted if a'British Ministry would look on and allow any Power to calmly walk in and wrest the fruit of the labours of British subjects from them. Practically the present prosperity of Bussorah is wholly due to British enterprise. The opening of the Tigris as far as Baghdad to the navigation of river steamers is due to the energy shown by' Messrs. Lynch Brothers, who for many year's past have carried on a regular service with two boats, being strictly limited in their operations by the Turkish Government. In the same manner they have opened the Karun to navigation, and having run steamers for years at a loss, are now beginning to reap their reward. They have done this in the face of the most bitter opposition and ill-will from those in authority, and had they been allowed liberty of action, there can bo little doubt that long ere this Bussorah would have been the centre of an enormous trade. Nearly all the carrying trade of Bussorah is done under the British flag, and it is almost entirely due to our energy that it exists as a port, for even the survey of the channel and the laying down of bouys have been carried out by British enterprise and at British expense. But all this meets with the severe displeasure of tho Turk, who suspects our every action, and is always deluding himself with the idea that we are only awaiting an oppor tunity to seize the country. To frustrate this alleged intention of ours, the Sultan now main tains a large number of troops at Bussorah, although ho gives out that they are there to sup press any disturbance which may break out in the Pirate Coast. Knowing 'the light in which the Turk regards us, and also knowing that Germany is looked upon as a friend, there remains a remote possibility that Turkey might be tempted to allow Germany to “ assist ” her in Asia Minor by establishing herself at Bussorah ; or, perhaps, the enthusiastic German thinks that this might possibly come to pass. Such a sacrifice of British interests could never for a moment be allowed. Wo do not want the country ourselves, but we certainly cannot see it pass into the hands of a rival. One thing is certain at the present time, and that is that the policy of laissez faire, so long followed by the British Govern ment in these regions, must give place to a more active policy if we are to keep what we have already won. Our trade in the Gulf is valuable and extensive, and is capable of great expansion, but unless the Government takes prompt steps to strengthen its posi tion, and, above all, makes up its mind to pursue, some definite policy, we shall soon see ourselves shouldered out by more capable Powers. Our great bugbear seems to be Russia, and here, as ,in other parts of the world, we are afraid to move a step for fear of irritating that Power. This policy appears principally to inspire Russia with a desire to obtain as much as she can, for one constantly hears stories of Russian aggression in Northern Persia. There is one way of strengthening our influence which recommends itself to many thoughtful men, and which if once completed would ensure the preservation of our interests by any future Government, for the responsibility incurred by the abandonment of an overland railway to India —if once constructed—would be too great for any Government to incur. This scheme, if it is ever to become more than a scheme, must be rendered practicable by the immediate conclusion ox some definite agreement regarding Koweit, which is now the only terminus left open to us. For several years past the Turks have been claiming jurisdiction over this port also. It is just on the cards that Germany aims at this place instead of Bussorah, for it could easily be con nected with Bussorah by rail, and is a natural port of great size. However, any arguments applied to Bussorah apply equally to Koweit, as the position of Germany established in a port of her own would, under tho circumstances, be an intolerable menace to our trade and prestige. It does not appear probable that Germany would aim at any Persian port—except, perhaps, Mohammerah, which is situated on the Shatt-al- Arab, sixteen miles below Bussorah, and which comes under the same category as Bussorah and Koweit, as the other Persian ports would not be of much assistance in consolidating her influence in Asia Minor. There is, however, one port which we must not overlook while discussing this subject, and that is Muscat, or the key of the Persian Gulf. This port, whichis a nearly land-locked harbour, is not of great extent, but it is undoubtedly the only suitable harbour for shipping for many hundreds of miles, and owing to its natural ad vantages could easily be strongly fortified. It is situated on the N.-E. promontory of Oman, and about 200 miles from the entrance to the Gulf, and if used as a naval base could very easily command tho . Gulf. Not only that, but it is far too near India for us to view its seizure by any foreign Power with equanimity. The coast to the northward is extremely fertile, and could be made to produce much more than it does at present if a judicious system of culti vation were pursued. But, above all, it is -worthy of note that the existence of a coal-field has been reported within about seventy miles of the port of Muscat. This coal-field is supposed to be near the coast, and although little is known of the coal, owing to the reluctance of the Sultan to work it, it is believed to be of medium quality. The objec tion of the Sultan to permit the working of this field is due to his fear that if the coal turns out to bo of any value, some Power on the look-out for a coaling port will promptly annex his terri tory. The country is at present under the supervision of Great Britain, which pays the Sultan a yearly subsidy, so that the interference of another Power—especially one with designs—• is not likely to be looked upon with any favour. In conclusion, it is perhaps not too much to say that at present Germany has absolutely no locus standi in the Persian Gulf, and if she fondly imagines that her advent as the Apostle of the “ Mailed Fist” would be welcomed in these waters, she is labouring under a delusion. We have never endeavoured to annex any terri tory, and have been satisfied with the results of lawful trading pursued under great disadvan tages, and besides this we have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds, and have given hundreds of lives in the suppression of piracy and the general policing of these waters during the present century alone. If Germany oi' any other Power imagines that we shall look on quietly while the result of our labours is snatched from us by some outsider, it is better Aul that Power should be undeceived at once. Fair competition will here, as in other parts of the v. n-hl, bo welcomed, but we have too much at stake i.; allow any interruption of the status quo. RUSTOM. THE S.S. CASHMERE DISABLED. Captain A. Gladstone of the steamer Clan Shaw, which arrived in harbour on Sunday evening, from Liverpool, reports that his vessel spoke the steamer Cashmere, which has lost her rudder, and is quite disabled to proceed further. Captain Gladstone triad to tow her in, but owing to the stress of weather outside at the time he was obliged to quit her on August 6th at latitude 17° 43'N. and longitude 08° 22' E. _ Captain A. Gladstone of the Clan Line steamer Clan Shaw, which arrived here on Sunday evening from Liverpool, reported to the Port authorities as follows Picked up on August 3rd s.s. Cashmere, latitude 16°26' N., longitude 04° 15' E., left on August 6th at 17° 43' N., 08°22&gt;.E., unmanageable (rudder damaged).” The Cashmere belongs to Mr. llajee Cassum Joosub, and was coming here from Aden n ballast under the command oPOaptain G. Soutar. The owner despatched Messrs. Shepherd and Co.’s steamer Bahaduri yesterday to tow in the Cashmere, which is about 300 miles from Bombay. The s.s. Cashmere, commanded by Captain George Soutar. with three officers, four engineers (all Europeans) and crew of 75 left Aden in ballast over a week, ago bound for Bombay. On August 3rd, when in latitude 16°26' North and longitude 84°15' East, that is, about 500 miles from i Bombay, she was sighted by the s.s. Clan Shaw about 2 o'clock in the afternoon ..bowing signs of distress. Captain Gladstone, com mander of the Clan Shaw, went to her assistance and discovered that her rudder had been so badly damaged to disable her from steering. The Clan Shaw •ucceeded in fastening a hawser to the stern of the disabled boat, but after taking her in tow for a few minutes the hawser broke. Further attempts that evening at fastening a hawser had to be abandoned on account of approaching darkness and the state of the sea, and Captain Gladstone stood by all that night. At 9 o’clock the following morning, with much diffi culty, another hawser was made fast, and the vessel towed until nine o clock in the evening of August 5th, when the hawser again parted. The following morning, finding that further assistance could not be rendered, Captain Gladstone left the Cashmere in latitude 17°43' North and longitude r 6S°22' East, about 270 miles from Bombay,and made for Bombay, where she arrived on Sunday afternoon. A STEAMER AGROUND IN BOMBAY HARBOUR. Messrs. Shepherd and Co.’s s.s. Premier was ordered to accompany the Company’s steamer Bahaduri iu search of the s.s. Cashmere, which is disabled at sea, about 300 miles off Bombay. The Premier, under the command of Captain J. Lenton, was proceeding to sea i i oui the Prince s Dock wall when she grounded near the Malet Shelf, a distance of about forty yards from the dock wall. She grounded at about 7 o’clock on Monday night at ebb tide, but she was got off at - o clock on Tuesday movninir a t high water.

A public meeting of the Parsee community was neid on bunday afternoon at theAlbless Baug for the purpose of recording its sense of the loss sustained t? 1 ^ J'* 1 ® death of Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, bird Baronet, and to elect Mr. Cowasjee Cursetjee Jamsetjee, the fourth Baronet, as their leader. The meeting was largely attended, most of the leading members being present. Shams-ul-Ulma Jivanjee Jamshedjee Mody, the Secretary of the Parsee Punchayet Funds, having n ^ tlce conveni ng the meeting, Sir Dinshaw M. Petit, Bart., was called to the chair. ^ ie chairman, in opening the proceedings, said that the meeting was called in response to a requisition forwarded to the Trustees of the Parsee Panckayet by no fewer than 2,100 educated and influential members of the community, which bore ample testimony to the late Baronet having carried out the responsible duties of the leader to their entire satisfac tion. The late lamented Baronet was always ready and willing to take part in every movement which was intended to further the interests of his co-reli gionists. He always used to lend the weight of his name to every movement organized in the interests of the general public. A courteous and gentle de meanour, both towards the rich and the poor, was a prominent feature of his character, and it was uni versally acknowledged that he had proved true to the honoured name which had been transmitted to him from his illustrious ancestor. It was, therefore!, the duty of the community to put on record its sense of the loss it had sustained in the sad and untimely death of Sir Jamsetjee. The next business, which would be laid before the meeting, related to the ap pointment of the present Sir Jamsetjee (Fourth Baronet) as the leader of tho community. It was a matter of great satisfaction to observe that the whole of the community was unanimously in favour of that election. The leadership of the Parsee com munity was not a bed of roses as might be supposed by some people. There were serious responsibilities attached to the office, and they could only be per formed by a man of ability, influence, and education, the late Sir Jamsetjee possessed all these qualifica tions in an eminent degree. In conclusion, the chair man expressed a hope that the new Baronet would follow in the footsteps of his distinguished predeces sors and carry out the duties of his high office to the entire satisfaction of the community. Mr. Hormusjee Munohorjee Chichgar moved the first resolution, which enumerated the most valuable and enduring services rendered by the late Baronet to the native community in general, and the Parsees in particular, and eulogised many of his good quali ties and expressed the deep sorrow felt by the com munity at his sad and untimely death. Mr. Chichgar, in speaking to the resolution, said that it should be placed on the records of the Punchayet. Dastur Darab Peshotan Sanjana in an impressive speech seconded the proposition, which was carried unanimously. Mr. Pheroze Hoshang Dastur moved the next resolution, requesting the chairman to forward a copy of the last resolution to the Trustees of the Punchayet funds with the view of adopting steps to insert it in the books of the Punchayet, and to forward a copy to the Dowager Lady Jerbai, widow of the late Sir Jamsetjee, and to the new Baronet. Dastur Bhciiarjee Lharoocha seconded the resolu tion, and it was carried. Mr. K. It. Gama laid the fourth resolution before the meeting, which was to the effect that Sir Jamset jee Jejeebhoy, the fourth Baronet, be elected the leader of the community in succession to the late lamented third Baronet. Mr. Nowrojee Jehangir Gamadia seconded the resolution. Before the resolution was put to the meeting, Mr. Muncherjee Cowasjee Munsukh rose to address the meeting on the subject of tho recent appointment made by the Trustees of the Punchayet Funds of Mr. Jamsetjee Cursetjee Jamsetjee as one of tho trustees, but as the meeeing was not inclined to hear him, he was asked to sit down. As Mr. Muneherjee continued to address the meeting, the chairman ruled him out of order, and he was eventually compelled to desist from further addressing the meeting. On the motion of Mr. K. N. Kabrajee. seconded by Dr. Cowasjee Hormasjse, it was resolved to forward a copy of the resolution to Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, the fourth Baronet, electing him the leader of the community. Resolutions were then passed thanking the trustees for convening the meeting and the owners of the Al- bless Bang for permitting the use of the hall. Mr. Darasha R. Chichgar, iu proposing a vote of thanks to the chairman, observed that Sir Dinshaw always held the name of Sir Jamsetjee in such high esteem that he always with his usual high-mindedness and large-heartedness gave precedence to the gentle man, who bore that honoured name. (Cheers.) Dastur Kaikhosro Jamaspjee Minocherjee seconded the proposition, which was carried by acclamation, and the proceedings then terminated. Our Poona correspondent telegraphed on Sunday A large _ and influential meeting was held of the Parsees in Poona this evening for the purpose of nominating Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, 4th Parseejl Baronet, the head of the Parsee community. The high priest of the Deccan, Sirdar Hoshang Jamasp, took the chair. ^Several propositions being agreed to, Mr. Aderioe Ghaswala prr posed, and Khan Bahadur Khambatta seeo/'ed, that Sir Jamsetjee, the 4th Baronet, be tbe head of the Parsee community. This was carried by acclamation. Numerous telegrams were next read from various places in the Deccan approving the object of the meeting, which was a most enthusiastic one. Sir James Westland’s tenure of office as Fi nance Member would, iu the ordinary course, termi nate in November, but at the request of the Secretary of State ho will remain in his present post until the end of March next. Mr. C. Fischer, Officiating Magistrate and Col lector, Burdwan, has been allowed leave for three months. Mr. H. Walmsley, Officiating Joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector, Raniganj, Burdwan, has been appointed to act. Mr. W. B. Heycock, Officiating Joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector, Burdwan, acts for Mr. Walmsley. Mr. Justice Macpherson, of the Calcutta High Court, has obtained an extension of furlough until November 21. Mr. Justice Pratt continues to act for him, and will perform the duties of vaca tion Judge in conjunction with Mr. Justice Stevens. Lieutenants O. Tandy, R. Thomas, K. Horne) and W, Evans, Royal Engineers, comes out next month to join the Indian Establishment.154 THE TIMES OF INDIA. [August 13, 1898. THE NEW VICEROY. HIS VIEWS ON ASIATIC PROBLEMS. Opinions on the Frontier Policy. The Hon. George Nathaniel Cnrzon, M. P., whose selection as the next Viceroy of India has been announced, is the eldest son or the Rev. Alfred, Baron Scarsdale, a country clergyman. He was educated at Eton, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he formed one of the band of brilliant students attracted by the powerful personality of Dr. Jowett. He made his mark as a speaker at the Union Society s debates, and afterwards as president of that famous Club. He graduated in 1884, took his M..Y in 1887, and was elected to a fellow ship of All Souls. At the general election of 1 1886 he was returned for the Stockport Division of Lancashire, which he has continued to represent in Parliament. But it was ever to the East that his eyes were turned, and about 1884 he planned a great scheme of travel in the Orient to examine on the spot the different aspects of the Asiatic problem. The greater portion of the succeeding years, up to 1892, were devoted to this self-imposed task. By travel and diligent study he has become one of the first living authorities on Eastern topics, and his ex periences and opinions have been embodied in volumes which arc standard works upon the sub jects with which they treat. In 1889 he published “ Russia in Central Asia,” an exhaustive analysis of the Central Asian problem, and of Anglo-Russian relations, especially in reference to India ; in 1892 his monumental work on Persia ; and in 1894 “ Problems of the Par East—Japan Korea, and China”—which was revised and a chapter added on the Japanese and Chinese War two years later. He also published last year, under the auspices of th ■ Royal Geographical Society (whoso gold medal has been awarded to him), a valuable monograph on the Pamirs and the sources of the Oxus, embodying the results of his own explo rations. What he had done for Russia in Central Asia, and Persia, the countries upon the west of India, Mr. Curzon hoped to do for Siam and the French possessions in Indo-China. All his travels impressed him with the surpassing importance of the position of India in Asia, which he expressed in his own words thus “ As I proceed with this undertaking, the true fulcrum of Asiatic dominion seems to me to increasingly lie in the Empire of Hindustan, Th-J secret of the mastery of the world is, if only they knew it, in the possession of the British people.” He qualified for this further work by travel in these little known countries, and a few detached newspaper and magazine articles from his pen were regarded as the precursors to another solid volume, but the pressure of public work, and the etiquette of the position he has held in the present Ministry, have delayed the completion of this project. Similarly, in 1894, Mr. Curzon traversed the North-Western Frontier of India, visiting Chitral and the Ameer, and wrote a valuable series of letters for the Times. His published works are so full and detailed that they form a complete index to his views upon every vital problem of the Far East. In 1891-92 Mr. Curzon held office as Under Secretary of State for India, his chief being Viscount Cross. In 1895, on the resumption of office by Lord Salisbury, he became Under secretary for Foreign Affairs, which office he has held over since. He did not have a seat in the Cabinet on either occasion. In 1895 he married Miss Leiter, daughter of Mr. L. Z. Loiter, of Washington. He was born in 1859. HIS VIEWS ON THE FRONTIER QUESTION. Mr. Curzon’s views upon the Frontier Ques tion have been clearly indicated in his published writings, but they were enunciated with un compromising clearness and vigour in the debate upon the policy of the Government in the House of Commons on February 15th of this year. The debate turned largely upon the occupation of Chitral, and in defence of the decision to remain in occupation he said There was a remark in one of the speeches of the late Secretary of State for India in the vacation to the effect that the natural boundary of India is determined by the stupendous range of mountains called the Hindukush upon the north. I quite agree that that is a barrier which no sane man has proposed or would propose to go beyond. But if you have a wall round your house, and if there is one point at which, owin' to the conditions of the ground, that wall can be easily pierced or broken, and if the occu pant of the house shows no desire to defend this parti cular point, no one would call him a strategist, and few people would call him sane. Yet that is exactly the situa tion in regard to Chitral. The great strategical importance of that place is due to tho fact that in this great range of mountains there are only two easy passes—one at a dis- tanco of 40 miles and the other 130/miles from the fort of Chitral ; and from Chitral itself tfiere are two compara tively easy routes, not over passes of Alpine altitudes, a the right hon. gentleman supposes, because the highest elevation is only 7,000ft. One of these routes conducts into the heart of Afghanistan, which we have pledged our selves to defend, and the other into British India. It is contended that no invading force would be foolish enough to run into such a death-trap as the Chitral Valley. But it was not found to be a death-trap during tho advance of Sir Hubert Low and General Gatacre marching from the soutli, and why should it be one for a force marching from the north ? But, after all, it is not the appearance of an invading army that is feared, but the establishment of hostile influence in the State of Chitral, which could only haw* a demoralizing effect unou. the whole of the frontier. Baying claimed that tliese dangers were not obviated by the Pamir agreement of 1895, he went on to defend Russia from the charge of rnala jides, and to point out how circumstances might be too strong for her. You cannot always be certain of frontier officers, either Russian or British. Already on two occasions Russian officers have crossed that frontier, and in one case they made a secret treaty with a chief under British protection. The House also cannot forget the fact that, although Lord Granville concluded in 1873 a formal agreement with Russia by which the northern boundary of Afghanistan was fixed, and under which she undertook that that country should be for ever outside the sphere of her influence and action, yet at the same time, when circumstances reached a troubled state in Europe, that agreement did not prevent a Russian Embassy from being sent to Cabul and a secret treaty being concluded with the Ameer land a secret corre spondence taking place, which was found by Lord Roberts. In the same way, I hold that with however loyalty Russia desires to keep her agreements on that frontier, it would have been almost impossible for her to do so if we had left a gap on our side. If you agree upon a frontier with a great Power, to cross which is war, one party to the agreement cannot run away from that frontier. Both parties must occupy, or at least exert, their influence up to that boundary, Russia has done so on her part. She has planted her soldier.- right up to the Oxus, and wo were equally bound to do the same. There, as elsewhere, nature abhors a vacuum. These States, of which Chitral is one, are so small that they not stand by themselves. THE LAWRENCE POLICY DEAD. Turning then to the larger issues revolving round the question of frontier policy, and the relations of English parties to it, Mr. Curzon proceeded to tear to pieces the arguments of the advocates of the Lawrence policy :— I agree that that policy was based on righteous principles, just as it was expressed in admirable form. It was a policy that was well adapted to its day. But right hon. gentlemen opposite are mistaken if they hold that it is applicable now. In the course of the recess rhetoric the leader of the Opposition said at Kirkcaldy that the sound opinion of Lord Lawrence was that we should stand behind the mountains and not embarrass ourselves with conflicts with the tribes by which they are inhabited. That, no doubt, is an excellent phrase for a speech, but, unfortunately, it does not represent facts. Tho Lawrence policy is really dead, and tho death-blow has been dealt by both parties in this house, and especially by those who sit on the other side. We are invited by the leader of the Opposition to stand behind the mountains. Well, it was Mr. Gladstone who first took us beyond the' mountains. We are also told not to entangle ourselves with the tribes. Mr. Gladstone was the first statesman to make engagements with the tribes Along the whole - of this prodigious line of frontier Mr. Gladstone’s Govern ment adopted a policy which, whether it was good or bad— and, in my humble judgment, it was good—was not, at any rate, the Lawrence policy, and they have committed us by that policy to obligations of honour and good faith by which every subsequent Government has been held, and which no future Government, whether drawn from that bench or this, will ever repudiate. That, I take it, is what Lord Kimberley meant wb^u he stated the other day that the whole circumstance of the case had been ;ely changed of late years, that we had deliberately adopted a more forward policy, and that the Libera l Government was responsible for that. IT CANNOT BE REVIVED. Mr. Curzon afterwards showed why, in his opinion, the Lawrence policy cannot be revived. There are two other reasons why the Lawrence policy cai never be revived. The first of these is the great chang which has taken place in the external position, which is div to the systematic, and I think also the legitimate, advance of Russia. When Lord Lawrence wrote his famous memoran dum in 18G8 Russia had only just subdued the Caucasus : she had not advanced to Tashkent or established her admi nistration in Turkestan. But now her flag is flying on the banks of the Oxus. Her frontiers are not thousands of miles away, but are contiguous to those of Afghanistan, which we are bound to defend as if they were the frontiers of Great Britain. Under those circumstances it is vain and childish to argue that those old formulas which prevailed 30 years ago are adequate to the new situation. The Law rence policy was designed to protect India from a danger which was at the time separated from her by thousands of miles. It is not quite suited to a situation wher forces of a great European Power are at many scores of points literally at your gates. But there is another reason why the Lawrence policy can never be revived. It is tho effect which would be produced in India itself. It is dnsy for the right hon. gentleman opposite to speak of onr sitting down on the banks of the Indus river, and there await the enemy that was marching to destruction. But what Goyqra- ment would dare to do it.-' What Government will guarantee the peaceful acquiescence of India behind it in such a situation. If the Lawrence policy were carried out it would mean that we might at once blow up the tunnels we have constructed ; tear up again the railway to Quetta, give up the whole life work of Sir Robert Sandeman. If we were to adopt such a policy all I can say is that our faces would be black before all Asia and all India. The Sikhs and Gurkhas whom we have attracted to our ranks, and I hope will never cease to do so ; the peaceful millions of India who pursue their silent industries in reliance on the protection we guarantee them, would turn from us, if they did not turn on us, in contempt for our cowardice. And I do not hesi tate to say that we should never have the opportunity of testing this wonderful revival of the Lawrence policy which is to save us from attack from without, because long before such an attack was possible we should have lost India from within. To sum up what I have said in a single sentence, I will quote the words of Warren Hastings, who said :—“To stand still in India is danger, to recede is ruin.” THE POLICY WHICH OUGHT TO BE PURSUED. After expressing his entire sympathy with those who spoke about the independence of the tribes, and protesting against the continued occupation of their territory, Mr. Curzon laid down the lines of the policy he thought ought to be pursued :— There is no one #here or on the other side of the House who has the slightest desire to destroy the independence annex the territory of any one of those tribes. We do not even desire to interfere with their customs, their prejudices, their religion, or even with their internal administration. But there our agreement with the other side ends ; and we are at once confronted with the question —“ Can we avoid the tribes altogether ? ” No, we cannot, for several reasons, the first being that however anxious we may be to let them alone, they will not let us alone. Many of those tribes are composed of men of a wild and lawless character, devoted to predatory habits. They insist upon raiding our territory and upon carrying off the flocks and herds of the people under our control lam not surpris ed that we hear no more about the policy of punitive expedi tions. Hon. gentlemen know that when these outrages take place an expedition is organized. It is sent across the fron tier as soon as possible, and burns a certain number of villages and towns, destroys a certain number of crops creates a trail of misery as it advances, and retreats, leaving the smouldering embers-of resentment and revenge - into British territory. That, I venture to say ' to the external frontier of which I have been speaking, or, at any rate, to take up a forward, although a less forward, position on the line of Cabul, Ghazni, and Kandahar, You must be therefore certain of tho main passes into that country; but if you leave the tribes absolutely alone, my hon. friend opposite would have you do, you can have no such certainty, and you may find that at the vei moment when you are called upon to defend the ou:&lt; frontier you may be engaged in hostilities on the inner frontier. We must, therefore, enter into some relations with the tribes. What form shonld they take ? Surely it ought to be possible—and my noble friend has found it possible—to construct a formula with which all will agree— that those relations should involve the minimum of inter ference with the independence or lands of the tribesmen. But three things are essential. We must have the means of communication by the main roads and passes. We must have the control of the Gomal and Khyber Passes, the Chitral road, and the main pass over the Hindukush. Secondly, we must have control over the foreign relations of the tribes. They must not be at liberty to side with our enemies. Thirdly, we must have some assurance as to their good conduct, in return for which we are always ready to pay them handsome subsidies. In my own judgment—and in this matter I speak for myself only— these relations with the tribes can only be successfully maintained by entering into confidential relations with the tribes. We have heard a good deal of Sir R. Sandeman in the course of these debate-:. I have had the advantage or the acquaintance and a long correspondence with that eminent man, and I can say. having seen his policy at On the spot, it was not a policy of laissez fairc, but, c contrary, it was a policy of mingled courage and concilia tion, and, above all, a policy of confidence and going about amongst and acquiring the friendship of the tribes. THE FASCINATION OF INDIA. Although Mr. Curzon’s writings on India have been principally confined to dealing with the frontier question and India in relation to Central Asian politics he has, in the opening chapter of his “ Problems of the Far East,” given vivid expression to the fascination Hindustan has exercised over his imagination. After drawing attention to the contrasts between Western Asia “ in the unyielding and pitiless clutch of Islam, which opposes a Cyclopean wall of resistance to innovation or reform,” and Eastern Asia, where we encounter only the wild faith of the Indian Prince, more or less:overlaid with superstition and idolatry or sapped by scepticism and decay, he says :— _ Midway between the two flanks of the continent whose rival differences I have sketched lies India, sharing the features, both good and evil, of both. She has wide waterless and untilled plains ; but she also has throbbing hives of human labour and life. Her surface is marked both by mighty rivers and by Saharas of sand. Among her peoples are Mahomedans of both schools, mixed up with diverse and pagan creeds. Of her races some have always subsisted by the sword alone, to others the ploughshare is the only known implement of iron. She combines the rigours of eternal snow with tho luxuriant flame of the tropics. With in her borders may be studied every one of the problems with which the rest of Asia challenges our concern. But her central and commanding position is nowhere better seen than in the political influence which she exercises the destinies of her neighbours near and far and the extent to which their fortunes revolve upon an Indian axis. The independence of Afghanistan, the continued national exist ence of Persia, the maintenance of Turkish rule at Baghdad and all dependent upon Calcutta. Nay, the radiat ing circle of her influence overlaps the adjoining continent and affects alike the fate of the Bosphorus and destinies _ of Egypt. Nor is the effect less remarkable if examined upon the eastern side, to hich in this book I am about to invite attention. - i 6 from jealousy of India, and to impair the position hich India gives to Great Britain in the Far East, that ranee has again embarked upon an Asiatic career and is advancing from the smith-east with steps that faithfully correspond with those of Russia upon the North-West. The heritage of the Indian Empire has within the last ten years made us the land-neighbours of China and has mul- tiplied three-fold the area of our diplomacy at Pekin&lt; r . Even the fortunes of remote Korea are in a manner bound up with the politics of Hindustan, seeing that it is by the same foe that,in the last resort, both are threatened, and that the tactics which aim at the appropriation of the smaller unit have as their ulterior objective the detriment of the greater. Such and so supreme is the position enjoyed in the Asian continent by the Empire of the Kaiser-i-Hind. Towards her, or into her orbit a centripetal force which none appears able to resist, draws every wandering star, Just as it may be said that the Eastern Question in Europe turns upon the dismemberment of Turkey, so the Eastern 4 - Asia turns upon the continued soUdarity of THE LINKING OF RUSSIAN AND INDIAN RAILWAYS. The consideration of tho extension of tho Russian system to the Afghan frontier naturally le,ads to the discussion of the much-debated subject of the linking of the Russian and Indian systems. As to the policy of this Mr. Curzon holds no halting opinion :— I come now to the question of the suggested extensi™ ct tJ,e Ime through the heart of Afghanistan, and its i lmclio °, wtth the Indian railway system at Kandahar. General Annenkoff has both m print and in reported interne,™ indulged in the most rainbow-hued anticipations of such m' amalgamation He has talked about Englishmen travelling from London to India in nine days ™ the Caspian and Herat , and, though he seems to have been struck by the improbability that such a line passing through Rnsskii territory could be utilised by British troops, he has express ed the ingenuous opinion that it might certainly be used bv British merchants, while an exemption might even be made in favour of British Officers. The physical obstacles to such a through line are nil. . . . When we return to the political aspect of the question we are in a verv different atmosphere. After all, the proposed amalgama tion must involve two consenting parties ; and if the Russian Government were to favour the idea, which is so contrary to traditional Muscovite policy as to be extremely unlikelv the consent of Downing Street, of the British House of Commons, and in the last resort, of the British people would still have to be obtained. I devoutly hope that not one of the three would for a moment entertain an idea so speculative in its inception, so problematical in its issues so perilous in the lateral contingencies to which it mHit give birth. I question if even from a fiscal point of view England would reap the slightest advantage from the alleged new outlet to her Indian trade; for this would speedily be stifled by the merciless prohibitory tariffs of Russia, which already have all but ousted English caravan- borne goods from the markets of Central Asia, and have seriously handicapped the export of Indian native produce and manufactures. On the other hand, Russian merchandise unimpeded by hostile duties, would descend in an avalanche upon the markets of Afghanistan, Beluchistan, and the Indian border ; it would flood the towns of Seistan and Southern Persia ; and England would find that she had stupidly handed over the keys of her commercial monopoly to her only formidable rival. But supposing these views to be exaggerated or mistaken assuming’ commercial profit to Great Britain resulting from junction of railways, and estimating that profit at the maximum, it would yet be dearly purchased at the cost of national insecurity, of lowered prestige, and of perpetual danger. The prolonga tion of the Russian railway through Afghanistan—for if° it were prolonged,! t is to be feared that as far as Kandahar it would be the work of Russian capital and Russian hands —would be regarded throughout the East as a crowning blow to British prestige already imperilled by a long course of pocketted affronts and diplomatic reverses. It would imply the consolidation of Russian dominion right up to behind and p; is not, in most cases, a successful' policy. What ^ ^ faults ? In tho first place, the blow is often struck too late secondly, you do not always succeed in punishing the tru culprits, and a good deal of suffering falls on the innocent thirdly, by retiring you create an impression of weakness and encourage a repetition of the same offence. Take the numerous .expeditions 'against the Waziris and the Black Mountain expeditions, of which there were two or three in the space of ten years. There is another reason why you cannot severely leave these tribes alone, and that is that we are bound, in the first place, by obligations to the tribes themselves ; and, (secondly, by obligations to defend the strategical frontier beyond. As to the obligations to the tribes, Mr. Gladstone was the first to take one of the tribes under ouriprotection after the Afghan War. He con cluded arrangements with the Khyber Afridis We have mice, under Sir K. Sandeman, made arrangements with the Beluch tribes. We have on the north made similar arramre- ments with the tribes on the Chitral road, and with the whole of the tribes inhabiting Waziristan in the neighbour hood of tho Hindukush. Hon. gentlemen opposite are very properly sensitive on the point of honour. I ask— Would they wish us to break the solemn undertakings into which we havfe entered with all these tribes ? THE THREE THINGS ESSENTIAL. After a brief allusion to our relations with the Ameer, Mr. Curzon dealt with the manner in which these obligations should be carried out : . R these obligations exist, and if this is their nature, it is clear that we may have at some time or other to advance Europe Question m.i u um vl Hindustan. In what relation to that problem^stand the countries and people of the Far East, what is their present political condition, and in what way they are engaged in constructing the history or reconstructing the maps of the future, it is my object in these pages lo determine. THE FUTURE OF ASIA. Mr Curzon s analysis of the Central Asian Froblem derives a greatly enhanced value from the broad and dispassionate standpoint from which he views the advance of Russia eastward, Ills own mental attitude towards Oriental poli tics he described in the preface to a later work when he said :— I can honestly disclaim, on the several occasions when I ?hY a e i raVe - lle r 111 East ,’ any “ priori prepossession for this or prejudice against that people. I have no anterior theory to support and no party interest to serve. But to my vision all the nations of the East seem to group them- selves as sections or parts of varying age, and utility in the most wonderful piece of natural and human mechanism that the world now presents, namely, the political evolution of What function is fulfilled by each the Asiatic continent. dividnally retard its progress or contribute to the collective WWmrn 1 * s wheels is to mo the most absorbing of problems What will become of this great fabric in the future, whether “VS 3 sptit “ addin,, to the already formidable stain upon tho larger units, whether the slow heart of the East will still con- tnme to palpitate beneath the superimposted restraints of Western force or example, or whether, as has been predicted some tremendous cataclysm may be expected, in which the’ con&lt;1,,eat s , hil i 1 01106 more ^ rolled back from , '/ 6s . t ’ ur ? speculations, to the solution of which I knowledge Uder ' 1Sh than t0 sub30ribo “W tamblo quota of THE RUSSIANS AT THE GATES OF HERAT. Iromthe first he recognised the enormous I 0 * 1 * 10 ® 1 ’ commercial, and strate- gical of the Trans-Caspian Railway, and antici pated its subsequent extension, and a move to- wards Herat. After drawing attention to the ease with which the line might be carried from Merv up the valley of the Murghab to Penjdeh and the confluence with the Kusk he draws the rollowing lesson:— Herat, already at the mercy of Rnssia, would be placed Af Jw y f her T utoh - Sb6 might not care to violate tte Afghan frontier and run the risk of war with Emrland bv be“ wfiblu 011 f ‘ he f’ 8 t0 He , rat itself ’ bnt hOT terSs wouM be within a few days march of the key of India and The occurrence of any Eternal complication might gTve the ste! nal for the short remaining advance.

It would entail a coterminous frontier. It would bring a possi ble enemy a month nearer to the Indus and to India. It would mean that at the slightest breath of disagreement between the cabinets of London and St. Petersburg, the British frontier must be placed in a state of efficient defence against armed attack. It would involve an enormous con centration of troops and a heavy charge upon the Indian Exchequer. It would necessitate a standing increase upon the Indian Army. For all these reasons I earnestly hope that no support will be given to England to a project so fantastic in itself and likely to be so dangerous to the Empire. THE STRENGTH OF RUSSIA IN ASIA. With a prescience which has been borne out by the subsequent development of events in a striking degree, Mr. Curzon foresaw the gradual extinction of British trade in Central Asia as the commercial fruit of the Transcaspian railway. Of its military value his opinion is contained in the subjoined extract :— Finally, I pass to the strategical consequences of the Trancaspian Railway, in discussing which I speak with the deference incumbent upon a civilian, though I do not approach the subject without consultation with others amply qualified on military grounds to pronounce an opinion. In this context the first and most patent con sequence of the railway is that entire shifting of the centre of gravity in Central Asia to which I have more than once called attention in previous chapters, the suppression of Turkestan by Transcaspia, the dethronement of Tashkent by Askabad. Then after considering the means of defence open to the Indian Government, he holds to the opinion :— The considerations which I have named above, while they modify the alarm which might at first thought be excited by the position and strength of Russia in Transcaspi , and while they justify the belief that a larger army than 0,000 men could not without considerable delay be pla^d, or without vast preparation be maintained, upon the Ri. b so- Afghan frontier from this side, do not substantially all? the central and all-important fact, viz., that a movement upon Herat, the Helmund, or Kandahar which four years ago was almost an impossibility by this route, has, since the completion of the Transcaspian Railway, become a measure of practicable strategy, and has thereby more than duplicated the offensive strength of Russia in Asia. When we include in our survey the forces of Turkestan, and remember that an independent though allied movement would simultaneously be in course of execution from that quarter, we shall better understand how tremendous that strength has now become. I am now merely pointing out the extent to which the relative position of the two Powers has been modified by recent events in Central Asia, and contrasting the initial advantages which they respectively enjoy. I am showing that while English statesmen have chattered in Parliament poured gallons of ink over reams of paper in diplomatic futilities at the Foreign Office, Russia,our only admitted rival in the East, has gone continuously and surely to work ; proceeding by the three successive stages of conquest, assimilation, and consolidation, and that at this moment, whether her strength be estimated by topographical _ or by numerical considerations, she occupies for offensive purposes in Central Asia a position immeasurably superior to that of England and for defensive purposes one practically impregnable. RUSSIAN DESIGNS UPON INDIA. Discussing the influences which have impelled the Russian adva-nce, he remarks :— The fact remains that in the absence of any physical obstacle, and in the presence of an enemy whose rule of hte was depredation, and who understood no diplomatic logic but defeat, Russia was as much compelled to go forward as the earth is to go round the sun ; and if any have a legitimate right to complain of her advance it is certainly not those who alone had the power to stop her, and who deliberately declined to exercise it. Whilst, however, I have confessed that on entering upon her Central Asian career, I belieye Russia to have been actuated by no far- seeing policy, and in pursuing it to have been driven largely by the impulse of natural forces, I am not the less con vinced that her presence there is a serious menace to India, and that she is prepared to turn it for her own purposes to the most profitable account. But he proceeds to emphasize his belief that Russia does not aim at the conquest of India. He observes :— I do not suppose that a single man in Rnssia, with the exception of a few speculative theorists and here and there a giddy subaltern, ever dreams seriously of the conquest or India. It would be an achievement compared with which the acquisition of India by a trading company in itself one of the phenomena of history,-would be reduced to child’s play ; it would involve the most terrible ami lingering[August 13, 1898. e for her to ho so u , in-ree upon a frontier with a great f oue party to the agreement th it frontier- Both parties must eir influence up to that Boundary; fart.

The consideration of the extension of the Russian system to the Afghan frontier naturally leads to tho discussion of the much-debated subiect of the linking of the Russian and Indian systems. As to tho policy of this Mr. Curzon holds no halting opinion I come now to the question of the suggested extension of the line through the heart of Afghanistan, and its junction with the Indian railway system at Kandahar. General Annenkoff has both in print and m reported interviews indulged in the most rainbow-hued anticipations of such an amalgamation. He has talked about Englishmen travelling from London to Lidia in nine days via the Caspian and Kent ‘ and, though he seems to have been struck by the improbability that such a line passing through Russian territory could be utilised by British troops, he has express ed the ingenuous opinion that it might certainly be used by British merchants, while an exemption might even be made in favour of British Officers.

But while he disclaims any belief in Russian ambitions for the conquest of India, he empha tically avers his conviction that Russian generals and Russian statesmen seriously con template the himxion of this country. Their purpose is a very definite one. Their object is not Calcutta, but Constantinople ; not the Ganges, but the G-olden Horn. He says The Itussian believes that the keys of the Bosphorus are more likely to be won on the banks of the Helmund than on the heights of Plevna. To keep England quiet in Europe by keeping her employed in Asia, that, briefly put is the sum and substance of Russian policy. OUR RELATIONS WITH AFGHANISTAN. In his discussion of . the relations of the Indian Government wHh the Ameer Mr Curzon includes the following significant passage :— To the hyper-sensitive custodians of British honour one is tempted further to address the question, whether pled°e- and microscopic fidelity in their fulfilment are to be an obli gation imposed upon one party alone, and that the partv which has nothing to gain and not the most to lose by the conflict ? Are we to be bound to the chariot-wheels of the Ameer, while the latter does nothing for us in return ? All offensive and defensive alliances impose duties and even risks upon those who make them, but these duties and risks are mutual and should not be heaped upon the shoulders of one of the two contracting parties alone. There is no reciprocity in an engagement by which Abdur Rahman is to have a lieu upon the support of British troops in outlying portions of his dominions, whenever these happen to be invaded, but under which British soldiers, British officers, even British civilians, are not otherwise suffered to set foot in the country for whose alliance they pay in hard cash—an engagement which does not even admit the presence of a British Resident at the court whose policy we affect to control, or of British agents at the frontier posts for which we are expected ^sub missively to acquiesce in the summons to fight. To quote a familiar phrase, the engagement thus interpreted is one iu which England is to receive all the kicks and none of the half-pence. A far more remunerative task than splitting hairs as to the verbal significance of British obligations to Af ghan istan would be the attempt to ascertain what are Afghan obligations to Great Britain. Again, in pointing out the possible recrudes cence of the Aghan difficulty in its most dan gerous form, he says :— So long as Abdur Rahman lives, a buffer Afghanistan may continue to figure in the list of independent States. Jlis health is, however, extremely precarious, whilst at any time a ruler thus feared, and in parts detested, is exposed to the danger which he recently so providentially escaped of assassination.

But while he disclaims any belief in Russian ambitions for the conquest of India, he empha tically avers his conviction that Russian generals and Russian statesmen seriously con template the invasion of this country. I heir purpose is a very definite one. Their object is not Calcutta, but Constantinople ; not the Canges, but the Golden Horn. lie says : The Russian believes that the keys of the Bosphorus are more likely to be won on the banks of the Helmund than on the heights of Plevna. To _ keep. England quiet in Europe by keeping her employed in Asia, that, briefly put, is the sum and substance of Russian policy. OUR RELATIONS WITH AFGHANISTAN. In his discussion of . the relations of the Indian Government wHh the Ameer, Mr. Curzon includes the following significant passage :— To the hyper-sensitive custodians of British honour one is tempted further to address the question, whether pledges and microscopic fidelity in their fulfilment are to be an obli gation imposed upon one party alone, and that the party which has nothing to gain and not the most to lose by the conflict ? Are we to be bound to the chariot-wheels of the Ameer, while the latter does nothing for us in return ? All offensive and defensive alliances impose duties and even risks upon those who make them, but these duties and risks are mutual and should not be heaped upon the shoulders of one of the two contracting parties alone. There is no reciprocity in an engagement by which Abdur Rahman is to have a lien upon the support of British troops in outlying portions of his dominions, whenever these happen to be invaded, but under which British soldiers, British officers, even British civilians, are not otherwise suffered to set foot in the country for whose alliance they pay in hard cash—an engagement which does not even admit the presence of a British Resident at the court whose policy we affect to control, or of British agents at the frontier posts for which we are expected sub missively to acquiesce in the summons to fight. To quote a familiar phrase, the engagement thus interpreted is one in which England is to receive all the kicks and none of the half-pence. A far more remunerative task than splitting hairs as to the verbal significance of British obligations to Afghan istan would be the attempt to ascertain what are Afghan obligations to Great Britain. Again, in pointing out the possible recrudes cence of the Aghan difficulty in its most dan gerous form, he says :— So long as Abdur Rahman lives, a buffer Afghanistan may continue to figure in the list of independent States. His health is, however, extremely precarious, whilst at any time a ruler thus feared, and in parts detested, is exposed to the danger which he recently so providentially escaped of assassination. His two sons are not of royal blood, and would, therefore, not appeal to the loyalty of the Afghan tribes, nor has either of them shown any capacity to suc ceed his father. Upon the death of the latter it is to be feared that a time of trouble will again recur, more critical than any of its predecessors inasmuch as Russia notoriously looks to such an emergency as providing an excuse for her next advance. Rival candidates for the throne will at once be forthcoming—Ishak Khan from Samarkand, possibly Ayub Khan from India, and very likely some other claimant in the country or from the Afghan Army— and in the state of. civil war thus engendered, it will not be Russia’s fault if she does not pull some chestnuts out of the lire. Finally, he points out the future policy to be adopted by Great Britain, and warmly advo cates the construction of frontier railways, in the following words :— In face of the contingencies which I have named, the lai'ger scheme may again be heard of, and to those who detect in such a proposal the glimmer of Jingo war-paint I make the unhesitating and unequivocal reply, based upon a personal inspection of both the Indian and the Russian frontier railways (in each case originally constructed for strategi cal purposes), that there is no such means of pacifying an Oriental country as a railway, even a military railway ; and that it for bullets and bayonets we substitute roads and railroads as the motto of our future policy towards Afghanistan, we shall find ourselves standing upon the threshold of a new and brighter era of relations with that country. MR. CURZON AND THE AMEER. Late in 1894 Mi*. Curzon visited the Ameer, and communicated a graphic description of the personality of the Afghan ruler to the columns of the Times. After briefly sketching the career of Abdur Rahman, and the means by which he consolidated his power, he said :— Nor should it be forgotten that in carrying out the policy of consolidation which I have described, Abdur Rahman has f\ooa and has acted alone. His is not perhaps the sort of natfhe relies much upon exterior counsel, or that com mits its plans to powerful Ministers or confidential agents. However this may be, at no court that I have ever seen is there less of the clientele of government, or of an adminis trative or executive hierarchy than at Cabul. The Ameer is the sole Government. He has no Ministers. He is his own I rime Minister, his own Foreign Minister, his own Finance Minister. Many of the ^civil and judicial functions of government he delegates, with a wise forethought, to his eldest son Sirdar Habibuliah Khan, who will succeed him. But in all the essentials of rule, he, and lie alone, exists. There is hardly anything, from the com mand ot any army or the government of a province, to the cut of a uniform or the fabrication of furniture, that is not personally controlled by him. He is the brain, and eyes, and ears of all .Afghanistan. The danger of so supreme a concentration is not felt while it lasts. It only emerges when, m the course of nature, it is withdrawn. ‘Then the faculties m others whose-development has been thus tacitly arrested are apt to be found paralyzed by their lomr inactivity. ^ j o The future of Afghanistan he foreshadowed in the following passage :— Ameer would not be the statesman that I take I to be if Ins devotion to his country were not accompar i recc &gt;guition of its intrinsic lack of strength. ] by this do I mean material or physical strength only— alter all the Afghans have shown on many a field that t] can contend even against a European foe—but those som of cohesion by which alone a nation can resist the combi: forces, of external pressure and internal disruption. Asiatic country, except, perhaps, China, has ever succ&lt; i idly kept out the foreigner or retained its independei except by borrowing some or the moral and intellect resources of that civilization which it fears. If Afghanis is to 1)6 kept alive, it will not be by the march of so m: thousand British soldiers to its defence, nor by themanui lure of repeating rifles and machine guns in worksh modelled from the European pattern, but by its adaptal to those conditions, under which alone, in the 20th cent! will continued national existence be possible. Of this man has a clearer perception than fits present ruler. . 1 do not say that the adoption of any or even all of tl measuies by an autocrat whose intellect may be generati in advance of that of his people, and whose lightest whir law, is synonymous with national resuscitation, or ■ straightway convert Afghanistan, which is now a w country, into a strong one. But I do say that they are steps m the right direction ; that they will tend to hi down.the barrier which character, history, and religion l combined to erect between the Afghans and civilizati and that by making them happier, more comfortable, n resourceful, and above all, less ignorant, their present r will, it he lives to carry out his plans, have done rr towards infusing his subjects with that solidarity/in w cey are at present so painfully lacking. The letter closed with a vivid sketch of the Ameer himself. Mr. Curzon said of him :— A few words may he added about the personal aspect, and attributes of the Ameer. A man of great stature of colossal personal strength, and of corresponding stoutness of frame when in his prime, he is now much altered by sickness from the appearance presented, for instance, by the photographs taken at the Rawulpindi Durbar in 1885. If I may hazard a personal opinion, I would add that he has profited greatly by the change. A large, but in no wise unwieldy figure, sitting upright upon silken quilts, outspread over a low char pot/, or bedstead, the limbs encased in close-fitting lambswool garments ; a fur-lined pelisse hanging over’the shoulders, and a spotless white silk turban wound round the conical Afghan skull cap of cloth of silver or of gold, and coming low down on to the forehead ; a broad and massive countenance with regular features, but complexion visibly sallow from recent illness ; brows that contract somewhat as the speaker is pondering or arguing ; luminous black eyes that look out very straightly and fixedly, without the slightest movement or wavering ; a black moustache close clipped upon the upper lip, and a carefully trimmed black beard, neither so long nor so luxuriant as of yore, framing a mouth that responds to every expression, and which, when it opens (as not unfrequently happens) to loud laughter, widens at the corners and discloses the full line of teeth in both jaws ; a voice resonant but not harsh, and an articulation of surprising emphasis and clearness ; above all, a manner of unchallengeable dignity and command— this was the outward’guise and bearing of the kingly host with whom I enjoyed so many hours of delightful conver sation while at Cabul. I may add that for stating his own case in an argument or controversy the Ameer would not easily find a match on the front benches in the House of Commons ; whilst if he can be induced, as can w thout difficulty be done, to talk of his own experiences and to relate stories of his adventures in warfare or exile, the organized minuteness and deliberation with which each stage of the narrative in due order proceeds is only equalled by the triumphant crash of the climax and only exceeded by the roar of laughter which the denouement almost invariably provokes from the audience, and in which the author as heartily joins. Like most men trained in the Persian literary school (Persian being the language of the upper classes in Afghanistan), the Ameer is a constant quoter of saws and wise sayings from that inexhaustible well of sapient philosophy, that Iranian Pope, the Sheikh Saadi. Nor do his written letters, as the Indian Govern ment knows well, suffer from any dearth of a hyperbole which if sometimes florid, is always artistic, and which, though commonly crusted with the* sugar of compliment, is suspected of occasionally but half concealing the barbed shaft of sarcasm. No one who converses with the Ameer or who hears him state his own views can fail to carry away the impression that he has been in contact with an intellectual force of no mean order and has met a most remarkable man. It should be added that this ruler, who is probably more profoundly and more reasonably feared by those who have crossed his path or are his enemies than any other living potentate, and, who like Attila the Hun, has been a veritable “ scourge of God ” to his adversaries, appears to possess the faculty of enlisting the devotion of those with whom he is brought into most intimate contact. In this inner circle those who respect him revere him; those .‘who like him love him ; those who are his servants become his slaves. GREAT BRITAIN AND PERSIA. Mr. Curzon set out to view Persia from an Englishman’s point of view, and from the point of view more particularly of an English politician. His book on Persia is primarily a political work, for ho attaches a vast impor tance to the part the kingdoms and princi palities of Central Asia are capable of playing in the destinies of the East :— Turkestan, Afghanistan, Transcaspia, Persia- to many these names breathe only a sense oi utter remoteness, or a memory of strange vicissitudes and of moribund romance. To me, I confess, they arc pieces on a chess board upon which is being played uiil a game fur the dominion of Lb-., j vvorld. The future of Great Britain, according to this view, will be decided, not in Europe, not even upon the . seas and oceans that are swept by her flag, or in the Greater Britain that has 'been called into existence by her offspring, but in the continent whence our.emigrant stock first came, and to which, as conquerors, their descendants have returned. Without India the British Empire could not exist. The possession of India is the inalienable badge of sovereignty in the Eastern hemisphere. Since India was known its lords have been masters of half the world. The impulse that drew an Alexander or Titnur, and a Baber eastwards to the Indus was the same that in the sixteenth century gave the Portuguese that brief lease of sovereignty whose' outworn shiboleths. they have ever since continued to mumble 5 that early in the last century made a Shah of Persia for ten years the arbiter of the Ea*st ,• that all but gave to France the empire which stouter hearts and a more propitious star have conferred upon our own people ; that to this dav stirs the ambition and quickens the pulses of the Colossus of the North. In the increasing importance with which domestic politics are invested in our own public life, and in the prevailing tendency to turn westwards, and to seek both for the examples and arena of statesmanship ,2 if amid youuger peoples and a white-skinned race, room may yet. be found for one whose fancy is haunted by “ the ancient of days,” who reminds his countrymen that, while longer the arbiters of the West they remain the trustees for the East, and are the rulers of the second largest dark- skinned population in the world ; and who argues that no- safeguard should be omitted by which may be secured in perpetutity that which is the noblest achievement of the science of civil rule that mankind has yet bequeathed to man. RUSSIAN DESIGNS ON PERSIA. Starting from this standpoint, the view of so eminent a man as Sir H. Rawlinson that Persia placed geographically between Europe and India can hardly fail to play an important part in the future history of the East, Mr. Curzon enters into an exhaustive examination of the political, commercial, and social condition of the country. The point to which most interest attaches now is his view of her foreign policy, which mainly consists of her relation with the two great Asiatic Powers, with both of which she is on terms of ambiguous friendship which the fears of either party alone prevent from assuming a less dignified expres sion. Upon the trend of Russian policy Mr. Curzon has no doubt :—' Firstly, then, as to Russia’s claims and pretensions in Persia. I venture without fear of contradiction upon the statement that these are distinctly, and in parts avowedly, hostile. Surveying the history of the present century, we see that, piece by piece, partly by open war and partly by furtive nibbling, Russia, has appropriated more and more of Persian soil. And after drawing attention to the strength of Russia’s position he adds :— What, then, are the designs which this commanding position, and the power of bullying that it confers, are being utilised to promote? There is no concealment either as to their character or their scope. Russia regards Persia as a power that may temporarily be tolerated, that may even require sometimes to be honoured or caressed, but that in the long run is irretrievably doomed. She regards the future partition of Persia as a prospect scarcely less certain of fulfilment than the achieved partition of Poland ; and she has already clearly made up her own mind as to the share which she will require in the division of the spoils. A RUSSIAN PORT IN THE GULF. Such, in Mr. Curzon’s opinion, are the designs of Russia upon Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazanderau, and Khorasan ; but this by no means limits her desire for territorial expansion :— But Russia’s appetite for territorial aggrandisement does not stop here. Not content with a spoil that would rob 1 ersia at one sweep of the entire northern half of her dominions, she turns a longing eye southwards, and yearns for an outlet upon the Persian Gulf and in the Indian Ocean. The movements that I have previously sketched along the souch and east borders of Khorasan, the activity of her agency in regions far beyond the legitimate radius ot an influence restricted to North Persia, her tentative experiments in the direction of Seistan, are susceptible of no other interpretation than a design to shake the influence of Great Britain in South Persia, to dispute the control of the Indian Seas, and to secure the long-songht base for naval operations in the East. This can only be accomplished in either of two directions, by a war with Turkey and the capture of Baghdad, or by a semi-peaceful advance through Persia to the Gulf. Of these processes the second is the more hopeful and the less risky, and there is a fascination about its beckoning linger that draws the Russians irresistibly on. A SEVERE CONDEMNATION. Air. Curzon, who was so tolerant of Russia’s advance in Central Asia, can find no palliating circumstances for this scarcely veiled aggression against the declining power of the Shah :— For my own part, while I hesitate to pronounce a de cided opinion upon a foreign policy which mnly perhaps find recommendations or excuses that I have overlooked, and w hue I admit that Russia is free to play her own game in the manner that she thinks best, I yet hold that her attitude \\ ith reference, to the internal politics of Persia can be seriously arraigned, and that she can in no wise escape condemnation for the resistance that she consistently offers to any proposal that has for its object the genuine require ments of distressed and backward country. Neither can I feel any sympathy with Russia in her lust tor territorial aggrandisement at the expense of Persia in the North. Herein l am actuated by no narrow prejudice or national jealousy, inasmuch as I am profoundly convinced the England neither wants to possess, nor ought to possess, nor ever will possess those territories herself. Nor am I a tainted witness as regards Itussia in the East ; for in my previous work I have admitted, and I here repeat the admission, that in her career of Central Asian conquest she has, though by devious and often dishonourable means, achieved a successful and salutary end ; and that she deserves the praise due to those who substitute order for anarchy, and are the pioneers even of a crude civilisation I have wished her well in Transcaspia and Tnrkistan, and I would be a party to no movement for disturbing her rule. But I do not say the same of Persia. On the contrary, the very pleas which have extenuated and justified liussian advance elsewhere in Central Asia, and which she is always quoting in self-defence, are wanting here. Still more strongly do these observations apply to her designs upon South Persia and the Persian Gnlf. Here not only, would any Englishman protest in the interests of Persia but any English Government would be bound to protest tn the interests of Graat Britain. No plea that the most sophistical of logicians could devise can bo advanced to justify any such proceeding. The safety of India, which is the first duty of Great Britain, the Pa* Britannica that now reigns in the Southern Seas in consequence of her temperate control, the sacrifices that have been made by her in the pursuance of that end, tiieutter abseuceof an}- Persian inter ests for thousands of miles, the perfect ability of Persia in theseparts to look after herself, are incontrovertible argu ments against any such aggression. It can only be prose cuted in the teeth of international morality in defiance of civilised opinion, and with the ultimate certainty of a war with this country that would ring from pole to pole. WHAT SHOULD GREAT BRITAIN DO ? Scornful is scarcely the word for Mr. Curzon’s opinion of the policy of the English and Indian Governments towards the Shah :— The public opinion in this country and in India with regard to I’ersian politics has been either at a white heat oi-°has oAefdod into an ine.v.uupor. Wo have made treaties with Persia imposing upon ourselves the most solemn, offensive, and defensive obligations. When the occasion arose for redeeming them, we have shirked the responsibility and have subsequently bought our release from ilie self-iutiicled tie. We have courted and waged war against the same Persian sovereigns, we have both trained and routed the Persian army, we have at once pampered and neglected the Persian people. Our Persian policy,in each-successive stage, whether of interest or apathy, has ever been characterised by the note of exaggeration. His own idea of the principles which should guide British policy are :— If then I were asked what is the policy of Great Britain towards Persia, I should answer in the following terms :— It is not now, nor at any time in this century has it been one of territorial cupidity. England does not covet one square foot of Persian soil. The Eighth and Tenth Com mandments stand in| no danger of being violated by us. In other words, the development of the .industrial and material resources of Persia, the extension of her commerce, the maintenance of her integrity, the rehabilitation of her ^trenffth. these, under the pressure, and by the aid of a friendly alliance, are the objects of British policy. The time for an offensive and defensive alliance has passed. GOVERNORS-GENERAL OF INDIA. FROM 1738 TO 1898.

(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENTS.) SIMLA, August 11. The appointment of Mr. Curzon has been received here with considerable surprise, as until the last few days Lord Balfour of Burleigh was regarded as far the most probable selection. Th e announcement has also been received with mixed feelings in official circles, as a majority had generally declined to believe the appointment possible. There are many, though, who think he will prove a success, as he is undoubtedly much- travelled, clever, and well up in the affairs of his party. He is, perhaps, young for the position, but he recently visited India and Afghanistan, he has long studied Eastern questions, and will, it is probable, he a warm supporter of the forward polifiy hitherto followed by his predecessors. He married Miss Leiter of Chicago, sister to young Lei ter of \\ heat Corner” fame, and considerable interest is felt here as to the probable constitu tion of his personal staff. The news of Mr. Curzon’s appointment only reached Lord Elgin this morning. Latek. Mr. Curzon will start with a decided advantage over most men who have boon appointed Viceroy, as he has given so much study to the questions of Asiatic politics. It is a curious coincidence that the original plan for the Government House, Calcutta, was taken from the plan of Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire, the house belonging to Mr, Curzon’s family. Mrs. Curzon is about 23 or 24 years of age, beautiful, cultivated, and attractive. She is-reported to he a good horsewoman and a keen sportswoman. Calcutta, August U- The Englishman says The appointment of Mr. Curzon may cause some surprise, hut it ought not to cause any regret or disappointment to those who have the best interests of this country at heart. Of all possible men for the appointment, he has the greatest knowledge of Eastern as compared with Indian polities, and it happens at the present time that it is no longer possible for India to throw on the Home Government the whole burden of managing iter relation with the outside world. Mr. Curzon is possessed of exceptional knowledge of both French and Russian Asia. He will he well qualified to control the Foreign Department of Government, and not having declared partisanship on the currency question, should be a strong man to hold an even balance between the contending parties. 'The Englishman concludes While this wretched plague is with us there may arise from time to time issues fraught with the greatest danger, not only from the spread of the disease, but from fanaticism fanned by ignorant leaders of the population. Mr. Curzon has already shown him self a strong man, able to steer hi's way through most troublous waters. He will not, we may he sure, he .turned by popular clamour -nto directions of weakness. At the same time his books show him to be a man pervaded by very strong sympathy towards the customs and prejudices of Asiatics. Our native brethren need not, therefore, he alarmed. We may be sure that the coming Viceroy will respect all the best traditions laid down by departed Viceroys regarding the relation ship that ought to obtain between the rulers and the ruled. DELHI, August 11. The Morning Post says :—A more excellent appointment could not possibly have been made. India has had enough of figure-head Viceroys with no pronounced views on any one subject, and willing at all time to degenerate into verit able marionettes. We shall have in Mr. Curzon a thoroughly practical ruler. The new Governor- General will formulate his own policy instead of placidly acquiescing in that of his advisers, and ho may he trusted to steer the ship of State rather than walk the deck and leave the rudder in the hands of the crew. THE PROPOSED CENTRAL STATION FOR CALCUTTA. (FBOM OUB OWN CORRESPONDENT.) CALCUTTA, August u. A letter has been addressed by the Committee of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce to the Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Railway Department, relative to the proposals for con structing a bridge over the Hooghly, a Central Station, &amp;c. The Committee regret that they have not been able to reply earlier, hut the magnitude and importance of the proposals made, and the bearing they might have, if carried out, on numerous different interests, necessitated a reference to the members of a Chamber and the Associations affiliated therewith. The Committee recognise the fact that a Central Railway Station would he desirable from many points of view. It would he a great convenience to the large number of suburban passergers, and indirectly it would benefit the city by opening out congested areas, and by making suburbs more easily accessible, and residence in them more feasible. It might also be the solution of the present difficulty in regard to a site for the terminal station of the Bengal-Nagpore Railway in Calcutta. At the same time, many important questions are involved, such as the effects of the proposed bridge on the course of the river, the cost of the whole design, and the incidence of a terminal tax on all produce brought into Calcutta by joint lines. This tax, which appeal’s to the Committee to he inevitable, may seriously handicap the trade of the port, and the Committee consider the whole question should be referred to a committee to be appointed by Government, sufficiently representa tive^ to embody all the interests concerned. This opinion is shared by the members of the Chamber, who have up to the present expressed their views on the matter156 THE TIMES OF INDIA. [August 13, 1898.

AGER’S TELEGRAM CODES are on SALE at the Office of the “ Times of India,” Bombay, The official announcement that the Hon. George N. Curzon been selected as (In- near I iceroy of India establishes beyond doubt the accuracy -of the rumours of the last few days. The selection will, we believe, give the utmost satisfaction in India, for nowhere in the Empire lias the promising career of the Viceroy- elect been watched witli greater interest and greater , approval than in this country. At this distance from England, whore the din of party strife falls faint upon the ear, men are gauged from a different standpoint than at home, and it is possible that a truer estimate is formed of their value as factors in the Imperial system. The scales of partisanship fall from the eyes, statesmen arc not obscured from tile view by the cloud of hostile critics who rise up against them, and they are judged, not upon their merits as fighters in a debate, not upon their ability to sway the issues of an election, but upon the extent of their apprecia tion of great Imperial principles, and upon the measure of their capacity to interpret those principles in the domain of administration. Thus it is that a Curzon or a Dilke, whose lives have been devoted to the study of Imperial questions, and whose power to put into practice the fruits of their researches 1ms been tested, command a respect and adherence in India and in Greater Britain which would never be accord ed to the purely Parliamentary exploits of a Hareourt, or—may we say ?—to the useful achievements in domestic legislation of a Balfour of Burleigh. Then, too, the mannerisms in the House, winch are made so much of at home and which count for so little, the hundred and one personal peculiarities which are reckoned by the Britisli electorate in their estimate of leading politicians—the Indian public, at any rate, cares for none of these thino-s In India British statesmen are judged by a broad er standard, and with greater breadth of vision comes a truer perception of the best qualities of the men themselves. The intense zeal with winch Mr. Curzon has devoted himself to the for ins new office in a way for which hardly any, precedent can be found among previous Viceroys. He has, in a measure, revolutionized the traditional conception of the training necessary for a British statesman. England has been too long accustomed to seeing her colonial and foreign policies controlled by men whose knowledge of the earth was limited to an occasional jaunt to a Mediterranean watering-place. But here was a politician rising into the front rank who did not hesitate “ the toilsome way and long, long league totrace ” in order to investigate for himself in far-off lands the inner bearing of those great problems upon which the future of his country turns. And it is because the whole of his labours have been specially directed towards acquiring a knowledge of Asia, and because it is known that the elucidation of Asiatic questions has formed the one absorbing passion of his life, that the appointment of Mr. Curzon is approved here, in the confident belief that under his rule the British dominion in India will be consolidated and strengthened, and the welfare and prosperi ty of the Indian peoples enhanced. If a mere attraction towards the politics of Asia were the sole recommendation to lie advanced in favour of the new appointment, it might, of course, be aid with some justice that there are other men of almost equal prominence who possess this qualification for the Viceroyalty. But Mr. Ourzon combines with his knowledge of Asia other gifts which stamp him as being peculiarly fitted for the post. The enforced exclusion of the Foreign Secretary from the House of Commons lias given him, during the present Parliament, a remarkable opportunity for the exhibition of statesmanlike attributes, and during the last three years his expositions of the foreign policy of the Government have laid the coping-stone upon his reputation, and wrung frequent praise even from his bitterest opponents. But, after all, in the eyes of the Indian public, his chief recommendation must be that he will not come out here a total stran- er to Asia, with everything to learn. He knows something of Asiatics, and of the ques tions which will be presented to him for decision, and he will not have to spend the first two or three years of his Viceroyalty in elementary studios. That alone is a great gain. • It may be said tiiat the merits we have ascribed to Mr. Curzon appeal rather to the British in India than to the native peoples, whose welfare must be his chief care. But we do not think that those natives who have taken the trouble to study the published writings of Mr. Curzon, or who have ever been brought into contact with him, will raise such an objec tion. If there is one characteristic more than another which distinguishes Mr. Curzon’s at- titndi. towards Asiatics, whether in Ipdia or elsewhere, it is a deep and sincere sympathy with them in their thoughts, their aspirations, and their prejudices. He is often—perhaps too often—an apologist for their faults, and certainly no traveller in recent years has taken greater pains to look at current controversies from the Oriental standpoint. There are many existent proofs that lie is strongly imbued with a desire to help forward that process of revivi fication which is slowly but surely taking place among the peoples of the East. With a firm faitli in the benefits which .British rule lias conferred upon India, he unites a keen appre ciation of the inherent virtues of Oriental races, a veneration of their ancient traditions, and a courageous hope for their future. Unless his whole previous career, and his words, written and spoken, have belied him, the natives of India may expect to find his rule guided and influenced by a wise and lofty spirit of tolerance. In another respect, too, his adminis tration may be expected to gain their approval. He is not a man who is likely to be led by official cliques, and to be a puppet in the hands .qf .his advisers. If there is such an organiza tion as a “Simla Gang,” it may be confi dently predicted that its days will be numbered when he lands in India. The administration may be expected to bear -the impress of bis own individuality. We have laid great stress on Mr. Curzon’s personal acquaint ance with Eastern questions, and we are aware that it may be urged against that he is chiefly familiar with matters winch do not directly concern the internal Government of India. AVe would reply that it m every sense advantageous that the new Vice roy should be a man who has been so closely associated with what may be termed the external politics of the Indian Empire. There are many signs that during the next few years the continuance of British rule in India in its present form may depend very largely on those great external questions which are cqmmg up for settlement in Persia, in China, m Siam, in Turkestan, in Asiatic lurkey, jinu. in nnfnrhnnofo will endeavour to associate his term of office hv heroic pieces of legislation, and that to nut if bluntly, tlie world will be favoured with anoth example of the egregious blunders of “ a mm, man m a hurry.” AVe think that the past training of Mr. Curzon ought to be a sufficient answer to such fears. Nowhere is the necessity of caution in affairs of State mop strongly impressed upon a young statesman than in the loreign Office; and Mr. Curzon has journeyed enough in the East to learn that beyond Suez “progress is an affair of lon« pauses.” It was well said in Parliament the other day that “what India needs is quiet” and Mr. Curzon’s examination of the present condition of this country would have been indeed profitless if the point, of the observation was lost upon him. It is not surprising that the appointment should be regarded 0 with “mixed feelings” at Simla, for, as we have already hinted, the Viceroy-elect is not likely to be too susceptible to bureaucratic influences’ whereat, doubtless, the rank and file of the administration will rejoice, with good cause But we firmly believe that the appointment is a good one, and that it is fraught with the best omens for the well-being of the Indian Empire and its peoples. study of Asiatic politics, the untirinn- energy lie has displayed m acquiring a first-hand know ledge of the problems now presenting themselves for solution upon this continent, and the fearless manner in which he lias formulated his conclusions, constitute the chief cause of tlie favourable impression he has produced in India It is recognised that he has' prepared himself irkey, and, in the unfortunate event of the Ameer s death, in Afghanistan also. It will inspire confidence to know that, in the troub lous times which arc before us, we shall have at the head of affairs in India one who can bring to the examination of whatever difficulties may arise a close and intimate knowledge of their various aspects. Mr. Curzon may be trusted too, to press forward the important work ol opening up communications throuo-li nrmah with China, and it is consoling to tlmik that with ids advent there will be no more talk of withdrawing from Chitrai. There seems to be a fear—somewhat pointedly ex pressed by our Simla correspondent—that lie a and the pb™ 11 admitted on Bri an Gulf. ‘lay ‘ n Abe House of Commons that rumours had reached the Government that a foreign Power seeks to acquire a port in the Persian Gulf, but added that he was nnable to say whether the report was authentic. Similar rumours have reached us of late from various sources, but in the absence of confirmatory proof we have hesitated to give them publicity. There was, indeed, a story to winch we referred some weeks ago, to tlie effect that the close friendship noiv subsisting between the Kaiser and the Sultan was associated with a desire on the part of the German Emperor to obtain a concession at the northern extremity of the Gulf. The story is, we believe, not altogether without support. The railways, built with German capital, which are now being pushed across Asia Minor, have tended to arouse in Germany an interest in the Gulf, which is regarded as the ultimate objec tive of these lines. Further proof of tlie increasing attraction which the Gulf exercises upon Germany is afforded by the recent appointment, upon a handsome salary, of a German Consul-General at Bushirc, which is not without significance when it is remembered that German subjects in the Gulf probably do not number more than half-a-dozen, all toid, and that Germany’s share of the Gulf trade is practically infinitesimal. But while the Kaiser may be watching the progress' of events in the Gulf with a close attention which is hardly disinterested, we do not beheve that the Power to which Mr. Curzon referred is Germany. In our opinion, the Power which is at present cherishing the strongest aspirations regarding the Persian Gulf is Russia. That Russia is desirous of reaching blue sky and open water through Persia is no new story. It is as old as the mythical AVili of Peter the Great. “Hasten the decadence of Persia, penetrate to the Persian Gulf, re-establish the ancient commerce of the Levant, and advance to the Indies, which are tlie treasure-house of the world,” ran the in junctions of that apocryphal document, and Russia lias ever kept them steadily in view. During the past few years the Persian question has been more or less quiescent, so far as the attention bestowed upon it in Great Britain Jr concerned. Mr. Curzon once wrote that “peblic opinion in England and in India with regard to Persian politics has been either at a white heat, or has subsided into an inert stupor.” AVe have been in the “ inert stupor ” stage for the best part of a decade now, though it is more than prob able that wc are destined to be rudely awakened from our torpor ere long. But Russia has all the time been quietly consolidating and extend ing her influence in Northern Persia and in Khorassan ; and there are indications that her activity is now about to be exerted in directions more openly inimical to British interests. The activity ,vc anticipate lias a direct connection with recent events in the north of China. British diplomacy has been assiduously—and rightly—devoted to checking Russian aggression on the shores of the Gulf of Pe-ohi-li. But the inexhaustible energy of Russia, when thwarted in one direction, immediately finds a fresh outlet elsewhere. And we shall not be very surprised if she responds to the check which Lord Salisbury is endeavouring to ad minister to her in Peking, by trying to effect a counter-move, having for its ultimate aim the securing of a naval footing in the Indian Seas. In making this suggestion, we must disclaim any desire to raise a fresh Russian scare, cither in India or in England. If there is any danger of a fresh attempt on the part of Russia to gain an entrance to the Persian Gulf, it is still sufficiently remote to be regarded with calmness. Elsewhere, if the Novoe Vremya —an officially- inspired paper—is to be believed, Muscovite hopes of introducing the warships of the Tsar into Indian waters are nearer realisation. The Novoe Vremya announces that Russia has acquired a Sultanate over Ralieita in the Red Sea, which is “ to be used as a naval base.” The story is an old friend, in a slightly altered form. If we remember aright, it was originally published some months ago in the London Globe, and was subsequently denied. This£HE TIMES OF INDIA. [August 13, 1898. LLE HOTEL, TILLE STREET, iY, LONDON, W.

It adjoins the French Protectorate of Obok, and was formerly in the Italian sphere of influence. Its value as a menace to Aden and Perim, and as commanding the southern en d of the Red Sea, will depend chiefly upon its harbour, which is believed to be de fective. But we are at present dealing only with the Persian aspect of Russian diplomatic enterprise, and we desire to point out the form it may now be expected to take. In another column we print a remarkable account, forward ed by our London correspondent, of a Russian scheme for uniting the Mediterranean with the Persian Cxidf by means of a railway. The pro posal, which is said to be under consideration at Constantinople, is for the construction of a railway from Tripoli Harbour, in Syria, to Koweit, in the Persian Gulf. Koweit being within Turkish control, and Russian influence being at present paramount in the councils of the Sultan, it is not impossible that the rumours of the prospective acquisition of a port in the Gulf by Russia may have originated in con nection with this project. We have received related reports recently of the watch fulness now exercised by the Porte over Koweit, and it is said that the large concentration of Turkish troops which has lately taken place at Bussorah has been carried out at the instigation of foreign G-overuments who fear the possible establishment of direct British influence at Koweit, and who hope that the proximity of a considerable force of Turkish troops may help to avert such a contingency. At the same time, we do not consider it probable that the Tripoli- Koweit scheme has any greater prospect of being fulfilled than has that announced by the Railway to India Company, and we are not at present inclined to attach great importance to the •connection of Koweit with Russian designs. The- principle of hotnogeneity in territorial extension generally .governs Russian statesmanship, and the activity we anti cipate will probably be first manifested in Northern Persia.

P. IlberPs omission to liclaudthe im mortal judgment of Jardine, J., in Ganesh Sathe s case. But we propose to say a few words about his superfluous attack on Lord Harris. Lord Harris may have had his faults,—to say that he had none would be to say that he was more than mortal—but he was pre-eminently a vigorous, sensible, virile Governor, a strong man among mi*u. The supercilious manner in which Sir John Jardine reproves him in the tone of a pedagogue addressing an infant school, would be irresistibly comic were it not at the same time so extremely objection abb’. The matter of the rebuke is still funnier than its tone, and here, in spite of our indignation with the garrulous writer, we must in fairness admit that he over came us, and we laughed, and laughed, and laughed. It was not Sir John’s intention to excite laughter ; it seems to be an infirmity of mankind to go off into uncontrollable mirth at this parti cular oracle’s most oracular deliverances. From the first sentence to the last Sir John s attack on Lord Harris and vindication of his own vast superiority is intensely farcical. Me are told that Government servants grew absorbed in their duties even to the pitch of excitement,” and the inference is that Lord Harris had reached that pitch, while our serene Sir John realised at once that his useful duty was to act as a moderator and sedative. He would be better qualified for that function were he less conscious of its importance, lu his normal state, when he did not imagine the world hanging on was certainly a quieting, personality. He goes on to say that the irritability of Governors has in late years “ led to several rash official prosecutions, culminating in scandalous State trials, resulting in acquittals, and sometimes in the unparliamentary practice of official attacks on the Judges.” Sir John is not wanting in sensibility to attacks on himself, it seems, but what are we to say to the blind indecency of thus stigmatising^ the deliberate acts of his own Government r From the illustration he has chosen himsell, we can confidently say that there was nothing “ scandal ous ” in the State trial, whatever jurists may think of the “ solemn judgment” of acquittal. Sir John refers to Queen-Empress r*. Kahanji, XVII., Bombay, 7oS. Need we add. the judg ment was delivered by Jardine, J. ? His version of the case is singularly misleading. He says that Lord Harris “ craved sympathy in the Trims newspaper, because of the acquittal of a Pindaric poet in 1893 by the High Court. lo call the prisoner a Pindaric poet, and leave the pu &gt;he to guess that Lord Harris prosecuted him because of the deleterious influence of Pindari poetry on the public, is a device j&gt;eculiarl&gt; reprehensible. Sir John goes on to say, ‘ lie (Lord Harris) had got this man convicted on the ground that a string of psalms and odes contained a line or two of sedition. Every man of sense and discernment who remembers the state of Bombay at the time the Pindaric poet took to publishing psalms and odes, as well as the quality of his psalmody, would naturally resent the unfairness of this absurd description. The next sentence is pure Jardine, J. : “ It would be out of place here to discuss a solemn judgment of appeal in wnioh that learn ed Brahmin, Mr. Justice Ranade, concurred with me in setting the poet free. If we could suppose for a moment that Sir John really meant Mr. Justice Ranade’s judgment and not his own, there would be the less ground for exception. We are, however, at a loss to under stand why, whenever Sir John refers to his judgments, he should think it necessary to de scribe them as “ solemn.” Ihe implication lurking in his mind seems to be that Ins learn ed colleagues on the Bench were in the habit of delivering judgments in a tone of reprehensible levity. It is nevertheless perfectly true that on verifying the reference which bir John utterable and misc concluding monition better have spent lib ing Guzerati with a on this prosecution, veiled impertinence « weary of Sir John, him in the least be not incorporate his j influence in Centn “ British Jurisdictio do not in the leastre&lt; ment on corrupt Ma to hear any more &lt; Seven Bishops.

Raheita lies oh the Africari side of the Red Sea, almost opposite; Perim. It adjoins the French Protectorate of Obok, and was formerly in the Italian sphere of influence. Its value as a menace to Aden ind Perim, and as commanding the southern m d of the Red Sea, will depend chiefly upon its harbour, which is believed to be de fective. But we are at present dealing only with the Persian aspect of Russian diplomatic enterprise, and we desire to point out the form it may now bo expected to take. In another column we print a remarkable account, forward ed by our London correspondent, of a Russian scheme for uniting the Mediterranean with the Persian Gulf by means of a railway. The pro posal, which is said to bo under consideration at Constantinople, is for the construction _ of a railway from Tripoli Harbour, in Syria, _ to Koweit, in the Persian Gulf. Koweit being within Turkish control, and Russian influence being at present paramount in the councils of the Sultan, it is not impossible that the rumours of the prospective acquisition of a port in the Gulf by Russia may have originated in con nection with this project. We have received repeated reports recently of the watch fulness now exercised by the Porte over Koweit, and it is said that the large concentration of Turkish troops ■which has lately taken place. at Bussorah has been carried out at the instigation of foreign Governments who fear the possible establishment of direct British influence at Koweit, and who hope that the proximity of a considerable force of Turkish troops may help to avert such a contingency. At the same time, we do not consider it probable that the Tripoli- Koweit scheme has any greater prospect of being fulfilled than has that announced by the Railway to India Company, and we are not at present inclined to attach great importance- to the .connection of Koweit with Russian designs. The principle of hoinogeneity in territorial extension generally .governs Russian statesmanship, and the activity we anti cipate will probably be first manifested in Northern Persia. Our London correspond ent points out one or two of the forms this restlessness lias already taken. The establish ment of a cordon of Russian troops last year along the Perso-Afghan frontier, upon the pre text of preventing the plague from reaching Russian Central Asia through Persia, was really intended to extend Russian influence southwards towards Seistan, and to block the newly-opened Quetta-Seistan-Meshed caravan route. The recent appointment of a Russian Vice-Consul at Seistan presumably has the same object in vieyv, for Russian Consuls in Persia are apt to hold exceedingly exaggerated views of the scope of their duties. These, however, are only isolated examples of the part Russia is playing in Northern Persia. The last report of our Consul-General at Meshed showed with greater breadth and clearness the general tendency of Russian policy in this j region. Roads arc being built under Russian auspices, Consuls are being appointed in many places, political agents under the guise of traders are spreading Russian influence all along the northern frontier, and, in short, the slow pro- j eess of “ Russification ” is being gradually i brought about, while the Persian Government grows feebler every year, and the representatives ; of Great Britain supinely watch the ousting of British trade and the undermining of British prestige. It is in the quickening of this pro- ! cess of disintegration and absorption, rather i than in immediate steps for the acquisition of a naval station on the Persian Gulf, that we ex'pect to see Russia answer the hostility displayed towards her by Great Britain in Northern China. But about the final aim of this bloodless and secret method of advance there can be no mistake. Twelve years ago Russia either cencluded or sought to conclude a secret agreement with the Shah, by which the advance of a Russian column into Khorassan was to be followed by the cession to Russia of the port of Bunder Abbas. More recently she tried to extort a railroad concession from the Persian Government which provided for a terminus at the harbour of Chahbar, on the coast of Persian Beluchistan. These state ments are made on the authority of Mr. Curzon himself. It is not always remem bered, by the way, that there is in existence an agreement, which still has more than a year to run, -which provides that no railway shall he constructed anywhere in Persia without the consent of the Tsar. We suggest, then, that the present political situation contains for Great Britain a warning of the probability of increased Russian pressure upon Persia, intended to bring the Russian Govern ment nearer the time when an advance may he made towards the Persian Gulf. What is to be tiie future policy of Great Britain regarding the Persian question ? Mr. Curzon said in the House of Commons that “ the Government had not been informed that Persia requires support analogous to that promised to China, or that any threats had been made necessitating such support.” We might go farther and say that even had threats been made, we are unable to see how Great Britain could effectively protect the Teheran Government against Russian aggression in Northern Persia. There was a time when we could have done so, but it lias long since passed. Russia has a railway all along the Persian frontier, and could pour an unlimited supply of troops into the Shah’s domMoris Without serious difficulty: Moreover, it is impossible for Great Britain to continue to commit herself to the task of maintaining moribund Governments all over the world. But whatever fate may have in store for Northern Persia, our position regarding Southern Persia and the Gulf is unmistakeable. There, at any rate, we have vital, interests to guard. The extension of the influence of a hostile Power over Southern Persia would dangerously threaten British rule in India. The ihtrusion of such a Power in -the Persian Gulf would he such an intolerable and constant menace that no effort would be too great to prevent it. For more than a century British supremacy has been complete and unchallenged in these land-locked waters, and has been maintained at the cost of “ hundreds of British lives and millions of British money.” An effort to establish a foreign naval station in the Gulf—he it Russian or German—would demand the most strenuous resistance which could he offered by Great Britain. We can find no stronger words upon this question than those used by Mr. Curzon himself. He wrote in 1892 that an attempt by Russia to establish herself in Southern Persia and the Gulf “ could only he prosecuted in the teeth of international morality, in defiance of civilised opinion, and with the ultimate certainty of a war with this coun try that would ring from pole to'pole.' Again, in the. same volume he wrote :—“ I should regard the concession of a port upon the Persian Gulf to Russia by any power as a deliberate insult to Great Britain, as a wanton rupture of the status quo, and as an intentional provocation to war ; and 1 should impeach the British Minister, who was guilty of acquiescing in such, a surrender, as a traitor to his couniry.' The time may come— though not yet—when these vigorous words will have a very real interest indeed for Mr. Curzon. Meanwhile, British policy can best he directed towards closely watching Russian movements in Khorassan, and in strengthening British influence in the Gulf. Of late years the Gulf has been more or less neglected, alike by the Foreign Office, the Indian Government, the Admiralty, and the public. Nobody seems to take any interest in Gulf politics, or to care what happens there. How is it that successive Admirals of the East Indies squadron have never taken their vessels up the Gulf, and leave it to be patrolled by two or three small gun boats ? A cold weather cruise by the principal vessels of the sonadron would afford a useful object lesson to the inhabitants of the Gulf coasts, and to the Persian Government, and would help to remind foreign Powers of the influence Great Britain exercises from Ormuz to Bussorah.— Times of India, August 8. We have drawn attention else- British Naval w hcre to the singular aver- &amp; Stdier e Sion displayed by past Admi rals of the East Andies Squa dron towards the Persian Gulf. It would be interesting to know when the flagship of the squadron last visited the numerous ports of the Gulf, and when any British warship of larger size than a small gun boat appeared in Persian waters. When con trasted with the placid joys of Trincomalee, the discomforts of a cold-weather cruise in the Gulf, where most of the anchorages lie a long way from the shore, arc doubtless not attrac tive ; but the extreme importance of British interests in the Gulf makes it desirable that the Admiral in command of this station should occasionally visit it with some of his larger ships, and exercise a more direct supervision over the police work which is done there. But while we think that the Admirals are open to criticism in this respect, it must be admitted that the fault is not wholly theirs. The truth is, in our opinion, that the East Indies Squadron is not strong enough for the work it is called upon to do. Of late there has been a gradual increase in the strength of most of the British squadrons on foreign stations ; but though the East Indies Squadron has shared in this improvement to a slight extent, we do not think it can ho asserted that it is at all commensurate with the vast interests commit ted to its charge. No doubt it is fully capable of dealing with the ships that other Powers maintain in these waters ; but is it equal to patrolling and defending the important posts comprised within its radius of movement ? The East Indies station extends, roughly, from Mauritius in the south to the head of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea in the north and from the Malay Peninsula westwards to the African and Arabian coasts, including the Per sian Gulf. The Red Sea, whichis also nominally included in the station, has been, we believe, for some inscrutable reason temporarily transferred to the charge : of the Mediterranean Squadron. The station is studded with coaling stations which arc of vital importance to the Empire, among them being. Aden, Perim, Colombo, and Mauri tius, all of which, in spite of their fortifications, depend to some extent on the fleet for their protection. To guard this vast area we have one second-class cruiser, three third-class cruisers, three first-class gunboats, and one special ser vice vessel, the last-named being a paddle-boat of no fighting value. There is, in addition, the Defence Squadron stationed in Bombay, consist- ting of two armoured coast defence ships, two torpedo gun-boats, and half-a-dozen torpedo- boats. This flotilla, which is not very power ful, is maintained purely for service in Indian waters, and is not available for cruising purposes. It may be useful to describe briefly the characteristics of the various vessels composing the squadron. The flagship Eclipse, which recently relieved the Bonaventure, is a new second-class cruiser of 5,GOO tons displacement, and 19| knots speed. Her armament consists of five G-inch quick-firers, six 4 - 7 quick-firers, nine 12-pounders, and four machine-guns. She is undoubtedly a fine vessel of her class. The Marathon and Melpomene are both third- class cruisers, and displace 2,950 tons, with a speed of 19 knots. They are each armed with six .G-inch converted quick-firers, nine 0- ponnder quick-firers, one 3-pounder, and three machine-guns. The Racoon is also a third-class cruiser, of 1,770 tons displace ment and 17-1 knots speed. She carries six G-inch converted quick-firers, eight 3- pounder quick-firers, and two machine-guns. The three gunboats, Lapwing, Redbreast, and I’igeon, vary from 755 to 805 tons displace ment, and all have a speed of about 13 knots Their armament consists of six 4-inch breech-loaders and four machine- guns, except in the case of the Lapwing, where a slight but unimportant variation is-found. The Sphinx, special service composite vessel, is maintained solely for the work of policing the Persian Gulf, and has an armament of one G-inch breech loader, four 4-inch breech loaders, and two machine-guns, but she does not add anything to the effective strength of the squadron. The Indian Defence Squadron con sists of the armoured coast-defence vessels Magdala, 3,340 tons displacement and 10 knots speed, armed with four 8-inch 14-ton breech loaders, and seven machine-guns ; and Abys sinia, which has a displacement of 2,900 tons, with a speed of 9 knots, although her armament is practically the same. The remainder of the Defence Squadron consists of the Assaye and Plassey, torpedo-gunboats, and a flotilla of six torpedo boats. This does not look a very formid able force on paper, and in practice it would he found even less formidable. Compared with the strides made in other squadrons in recent years, it will, we think, be recognised that the Admiralty has allowed the naval forces in East Indian waters to lag behind. It is true that there have been some slight improvements of late. For instance, the substitution of the Eclipse, with her quick-firers, for the Bonaven ture, was a decided acquisition to tbe station ; and the arrival of the Melpomene and Racoon, in place of the Brisk and Cossack, and the eoaversion of their breech-loaders into quick- firers, was also advantageous. In like manner, the Marathon has been home and has had her breech-loaders converted into quick-firers. But these changes, excellent though they are as a beginning, need to bo carried much further. The exigencies of the present political situation point to the possibility that in the near future British naval strength in the Indian Ocean may become a matter of real moment, The possible appear ance of Russia in the Red Sea may perhaps be discounted for the present. But it is now common knowledge that one, if not two, Powers, are seeking by more or less circuitous methods to obtain a foothold in the Persian Gulf, where the British Navy has hitherto remained in undisturbed possession. Should a sudden demonstration become necessary, we have certainly not got a very imposing squadron to send either to the Persian Gulf or anywhere else, even if we assembled all our ships, -which is not a policy to be recommended. The critical condition of the China question affords another argument in favour of our con tention. The Admiralty has recognized the grow ing gravity of the situation in China by hasti ly reinforcing the China Squadron, and though the Mediterranean Squadron has been somewhat weakened thereby, it remains formidable enough for all practical purposes. But the East Indies Squadron, which should form a strong connect ing link in our chain of naval defences from Gibraltar to Hong-Kong, remains dangerously feeble. It may argued that should necessity arise Rear-Admiral Douglas’s command could be promptly reinforced from the China or the Mediterranean Squadrons. Such a course would not only be unwise, hut in the event of a sudden outbreak of war would probably prove impracti cable. Our view of the functions to be dis charged by the East Indies Squadron is that it should not only be powerful enough to afford reasonable protection for the enormous interests under its care, but that it should, if neces sary, act as a^ feeder to the China Squad ron. The principle of weakening the Medi terranean or Channel Squadrons when rein forcements are required in China is not only radically unsound but involves dangerous delay. The Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies station ought to be in a position to detail at least two second-class cruisers for temporary service with either the China or the Cape Squadrons, if reqa^d. For this purpose, and tor. the efficient discharge of the ordinary duties pertaining to the station, it may be laid down that one first-class cruiser as flagship, three second-class cruisers and four third-class cruisers are necessary. Three gunboats— the present complement—are probably enough for their particular work, and as they are of little of ho fighting value, it does not matter whether their number is increased or riot; But what is essential is that tfie station should also be supplied with at ledst three of the older torpedo-boat destfoyers, riot only on account of , their practical value, hut also for instructioiial purposes. There would then be a squadron available for service anywhere on the station composed of eight cruisers, three gunboats, three destroyers, and a special service vessel, which does not appear too powerful when one considers the interests at stake. We never read anything from T of?Sed nS the pen of Sir John Jarditie Judge. without a poignant regret that so much erudition should be cast away for want of a little saving humour. Sir John is always learned, generally pleasant, but only too often he is exceedingly amusing where he least expects to be. For instances of that vice which penetrates all his published works, the vice of ingenuous egotism, untem- pered by a gleam of humorous insight, we would refer the enquirer to Sir John’s published works nassim, and in particular to his latest effort in the Asiatic Quarterly. The paper is headed “ Im perial Parliament Supreme in India,” and pro fesses to he a review, in the manner of Macaulay, of Sir C. P. llbert’s book, “ The Government of India.” When we say in the manner of Macaulay, we mean that the writer has taken a volume as a text upon which to hang a dissertation that has little to do with the book or its contents. Upon seeing an article by Sir John Jardine, the expert naturally turns page after page with avidity in search of the old familiar friends. He has a well-grounded expectation of encoun tering them, and so far as our experience goes that expectation has never yet been disap pointed. The present article forms no excep tion to the rule. After getting through about a third of it, we confess to having been oppressed with apprehensions. Could it 'be possible that Sir John was becoming forgetful of his old loves, of the themes which had made him celebrated ? But we were not kept much longer in suspense ; the period of restraint ended, and with a ready exuberance in strong contrast with the moderation of the preced ing passages, Sir John let himself go upon the dear old topics of the corrupt Manilatdars, Ganesh Sathe, Magna Charta and the trial of the Seven Bishops. Satisfied that in the distin guished author we had another exemplification of the truth of the old saying, “ Gatlwn non animam mutant qui tram mare cvrrunt,' we settled down to consider critically the value of Sir John’s contribution to current opinion on. India. We are grateful to him for the pleasant introduction and the interesting account lie has given us of various bankrupt Governors. Sir John lias a turn for quaint research, he is com mendahly diligent, and it not unfrequently occurs that he lights upon facts which we are glad to know. We are not, however, sufficiently sanguine to expect that Sir John will ever keep long upon such obscure and neutral ground. The unprepared reader will receive his first gentle shock on finding that “ the Fouzdars, Munsiffs, and Ameens were soon made to dispense the native laws in ways uncustomary (sic) to them, but familiar to a nation wedded to substantial justice and the Magna Charta.” Here is the first peep at poor King Charles’s head. We pause here to digress briefly upon Sir John’s wonderful style. Sublimely and imperviously superior, his sentences run on, conveying a first impression of veiled depths of meaning. Every now and then he deserts the dignified equanimity which befits an Olympian, and indulges in a piece of really fine writing of the kind clever school-boys so much delight in. As for example : “ The British Indian Constitution as it stands to-day is the creation of the House of Commons evolved from the period of Pitt, Fox and Burke, out of party fights, clashing divisions and furious faction.” This by way of showing that “ Todgers can do it,” we suppose. After a time the bewildered reader begins to ask himself wdiat Sir John really means, what is the principle he is seeking to expound; and by degrees it becomes clearer and clearer, that ' all of Sir John’s writing which is not pregnantly platitudinous, falls within the scope of Sir John’s undisclosed motto, Laus et gloria Jardinio. To those behind the scenes, it is a perennial source of wonder and reluctant admiration to watch the innocent skill witli which Sir John leads every topic through rills of vulgar misapprehension up to its origin in some great achievement of his own. We should not have thought it worth while, in a city where Sir John Jardine was so well-known, to have commented severely on the unparalleled and blissful illusions respecting his own services to the State, in which Sir John dreams away his retirement, had he limited himself, as we are bound to say lie usually does, to being his own panegyrist. But in the pre sent article he has gone out of his way to deliver an attack on Lord Harris personally, and by implication on Governors generally, for which we can discover no justification. We pass over Sir John’s regret that Sir C. P. Ilbert made no allusions in his book to “ the debates in Hansard on a later pretension of a local Governor to retain in ■judicial office a host of corrupt men,” merely remarking that what Sir John really regfetted158 THE TIMES OF INDIA. [Aucujg'r 13, 1898. was Sir C. P. Ilbert’s omission to belaud the im mortal judgment of Javdine, J., in G-anesh Sathe case. But we propose to say a few words about liis superfluous attack on Lord Harris. Lor’ Harris may have had his faults,—to say that he had none would be to say that he was more than mortal,—but he was pre-eminently a vigorous, sensible, virile Governor, a strong man among men. The supercilious manner in which Sir .lohn Jardine reproves him in the tone of a pedagogue addressing an infant school, would be irresistibly comic were it not at the same time so extremely objectionable. The matter of the rebuke is still funnier than its tone,and here, in spite of our indignation with the garrulous writer, we must in fairness admit that he over came us, and we laughed, and laughed, and laughed. It was not Sir John’s intention to excite laughter ; it seems to be an infirmity of mankind to go off into uncontrollable mirth at this pa cularoracle’s most oracular deliverances. From the first sentence to the last Sir John’s attack on Lord Harris and vindication of his own vast superiority is intensely farcical. We are told that Government ’ servants “ grew absorbed in their duties even to the pitch of excitement,” anil the inference is that Lord Harris had reached that pitch, while our serene Sir John realised at once that his useful duty was to act as a moderator and sedative. He would be bettor qualified for that function were he less conscious of its importance. In his normal state, when he did not imagine the world hanging on his words, Sir John was certainly a quieting, not to say a narcotic personality. He goes on to say that the irritability of Governcrs has in late years “ led to several rash official prosecutions, culminating in scandalous State trials, resulting in acquittals, and sometimes in the unparliamentary practice of official attacks on the Judges.” Sir John is not wanting in sensibility to attacks on himself, it seems, but what are we to say to the blind indecency of thus stigmatising the deliberate acts of his own Government ? From the illustration he has chosen himself, we can confidently say that there was nothing “scandal ous ” in the State trial, whatever jurists may think of the “ solemn judgment” of acquittal Sir John refers to Queen-Kmpress rs. Kahauji XVII., Bombay, 7f&gt;&lt;s. Need we add. the judg ment was delivered by Jardine, J. ? llis version of the case is singularly misleading. He says that Lord Harris “ craved sympathy in the Times newspaper, because of the acquittal of a Pindaric poet in 1893 by the High Court.” To call the prisoner a Pindaric poet, and leave the public to guess that Lord Harris prosecuted him because of the deleterious influence of Pindar poetry on the public, .js , a device peculiarly reprehensible. Sir John goes on to say, “He (Lord Harris) had got this man convicted’ on the ground that a string of psalms and odes contained a line or two of sedition.’ Every man of sense and discernment who remembers the state of Bombay at the time the Pindaric poet took to publishing psalms and odes, as well .as the quality of his psalmody, would naturally resent the unfairness of this absurd description. The next sentence is pure Jardinh, J. : “ It would be out of place here to discuss a solemn judgment of appeal in wnich that learn ed Brahmin, Mr. Justice Ranade, concurred with me in setting the poet free.” If we could suppose for a moment that Sir John really meant Mr. Justice Kanade’s judgment and not his own, there would be the less ground for exception. We are, however, at a loss to under stand why, whenever Sir John refers to his judgments, he should think it necessary to de scribe them as “ solemn.” The implication lurking in his mind seems to be that his learn ed colleagues on the Bench were in the habit of delivering judgments in a tone of reprehensible levity. It is nevertheless perfectly true that on verifying the reference which Sir John thoughtfully gives—and which, of course, refers to his own judgment—we begin vaguely to understand the caution which prompted Sir John to tell the lay reader that this was a “ solemn ” judgment. We must be pardoned for saying again that we read it with uncontrol lable laughter. Gilbert and Sullivan would give anything for the copyright. Let any man who doubts us read it for himself. Could any thing be more wildly funny than tlie “ solemn” allusion to the “ First song to the tune ‘ Lord now you released the elephant from jeopardy Throughout the whole unique composition there is a bewildering blend of erudition and bathos, a jumble of ill-assorted knowledge pieced to gether with surprising applications. We have no hesitation in saying that if Sir John thinks that a solemn judgment, the world would give much to hear what lie considers to be a jocose one. We are perfectly certain that it is incom parably the funniest thing to be found in the Law Reports, and we are very grateful to Sir John for having drawn public attention to it. Sir John, like Gilbert’s sentimental pieman, seems to be distinguished for a strong poetic feel ing. It is very unlikely that any average Englishman in Bombay would have been so carried away by the Pindaric beauties of these “ psalms ” as to have overlooked their dangerous and inflammatory tendency. But where the Muses are concerned, Sir J olm is poet first and judge afterwards. He tells the public that the poems are “ fine and vigorous, ” and refers them to his judgement for proof. We have read them, necessarily reading the judgement too, which will please Sir John, and we think them un utterable and mischievous drivel. Sir John’ concluding monition to Lord Harris that he had better have spent his time and money in study ing Guzerati with a Pandit, than in carrying- on this prosecution, is of a piece with the thinly veiled impertinence of the whole passage. We weary of Sir John. We do not sympathize with him in the least because Sir C. P. Ilbert did not incorporate Ids judgement upon “ spheres of influence in Central Africa ” in the chapter British Jurisdiction in Foreign States.” We do not in the least regret the absence of his judge ment on corrupt Mamlatdars ; we do not want to hear any more of Magna Oharta and the Seven Bishops. If we might hope that Sir John would read these lines, and that they would persuade him to devote the remainder of his life to Spanish poetry, we should feel that we had conferred a great boon on Bombay. That one of the direct results of the recent frontier campaign should be the addition of mother examination to the already lengthy list which the aspirant to appointments the army of to-day is either com jelled or permitted to pass is not surpris- ig. The craze for examinations has taken renter hold in the army than in almost any other profession, and in India especially the disease has developed to an extent that calls for a Pasteur or Haffkine to devise a protective scrum. From start to finish of his military jareer the British officer is now in a constant state of preparing for an examination, passing an examination, or looking np regulations to find mtthe books with which he will have to maki himself acquainted for the next examination, ''hat this results in regiments frequently short-handed goes without saying, and hat paucity of officers does not tend to the tlieiency of regiments—especially native regi ments—needs no demonstration. To the civilised mind it presents itself as a paradox, that a practical profession like the army should be able to devise no better test of ability in the case of elderly field officer and junior subaltern alike, than an examination conducted largely on paper, the preparation for which has consisted—if not entirely, at all events nearly so—in the more or less conscientious study of certain recognised text-books. So long as the modern military mind can devise no better test of ability in senior or junior, and no other panacea for all ills, than another examination, so long will text-books be written and studied. Far be it from us to deprecate the intelligent study of their profession by officers. What we object to is a system that tends to limit study to the accumulation of ’ nowledge in that bOnCentrated and indigestible form in which it is devoured, but not assimi lated, for examination purposes only. The aim and object, we take it, of all military education is to render an officer ready to act intelligently in any emergency that may arise. History repeats itself nowhere so much as on a battle field or in the minor incidents of a campaign, and the knowledge of what has been done in similar circumstances in the past serves as a uide or warning, as the case may be, for action in the present. But for this knowledge to be of any use it must have been so assimilated that the decision and action have the spontaneity of originality, and not be the result of slowly thinking out what is said at this page of this book, or in that account of that campaign. Theoretically, a course of examinations will elicit to take an all too rosy view of everything ? This is ground upon which we do not propose to tread. But we think that much might be done to improve the existing state of affairs, without the introduction of any violent changes, or even the institution of a new examination. Most district commands as at present arranged contain isolated stations occupied by single regiments or even detachments. Such stations are too small to warrant frequent visits from the District Commander, and it may be justly said that the General Officer Command ing can make few opportunities of visitim these small cantonments without neglecting the interests of the bulk of his command. It is, therefore, impossible that ke should be equally well acquainted with the capabilities of officers serving in such stations as with those in more important and larger cantonments, This brings us to a point upon which we hav frequently insisted—that isolated stations are detrimental to efficiency. Many, it is true, have been abolished, and more might be under existing conditions of the country and the increased railway and telegraphic facilities fo rapid communication. But the ever present question of expense crops up. Existin barrack accommodation must be utilized. new barracks built at heavy cost, the old being practically unsaleable for any purpose as a set-off against the expense. Again, there are old treaties with Native States involving the maintenance of troops at various plnces, which cannot be set aside without difficulty and delay, and last, but not least, increased expense, as the removal of the troops would naturally entail the cessation of the contribution received from the States on their recount. Still, great as the difficulties are, if the army is to be kept up to the modern scale of flioicncy, they should be faced, and troops con centrated until a General Officer’s command becomes a reality as regards handling and knowing the troops in the district, and not, as at present, a Central Office for the transaction of the business of a large number of outlying stations, each containing an inconsiderable hand ful of men. The efficiency of all ranks would THURSDAY’S BOMBAY “GOVERN MENT GAZETTE.” increased by the emulation fostered by the proximity of other corps, whilst the possibility of the General making himself acquainted with the capabilities of those under his command would be largely increased. Such a change ould probably lead to another, equally, if not more, important, in our opinion. The present mobilization .scheme appears to be wanting in every element that tends to success. Generally speaking, it appears to start from the assumption chat everyone who can be spared from the peace establishment should be the first to be mobilised for active service. In other words it begins to work on the difference between the normal peace garrison and the compulsory garrison of each station, and provides for the mobilisation of these troops first. Commands and stall are then allotted on a principle—shall we say—of free selection, the limitation being that as few as possible of the General and Staff Officers, already selected for their appointments in peace time, should be given similar appointments in war. This seems an anomaly, and the result is still stranger. Regiments collected from different commands are brigaded together under a General who may or may not have commanded a brigade in time of peace, and with whom none of them have ever worked before. Add to this a staff drawn from here, there, and everywhere, un known to the General, and probably unknown prompt application of knowledge in the field. But it may be argued that though not an infallible test, still, in default oi a better, the examination serves its purpose, and as prac tical soldiering does not occur every day recourse must tie had to some other test, and an examination is at all events a guide, if not an actual test. It may be a mistaken idea on our part, but we have always been under the impres sion that regiments were reported on yearly in minute detail—especially in the case of officers by General Officers Commanding ; and that these reports were specially directed to bo based not on what was seen on the two or three days of actual inspection when the house is popularly supposed to be swept and garnished, but on the work that has been carried out through the year, and the frequent opportunities that General Officers would take or make of seein'- and judging for themselves of the efficiency of all ranks at all times and in all positions. If this be carried out it would seem impossible that, say, an incapable second-in-command should survive to succeed to the command, and the intervention of further agency in the form of an examination to show up his inefficiency Id n.nnr&gt;n.r snnp.rflnnna Similnvhr ii... ~— information as to the capabilities of officers on to most of the troops, with or without previous these points ; practically, it is found that pass- peace training ; and, to put it mildly it is some mg examinations is no absolute criterion of the time before the hastily put together machine works smoothly. That it works at all speaks highly for the adaptability of the British officers. For years the army has suffered from what may be called “ hasty Germauization on imperfectly-considered premises,” and many things have been copied that might well have been left alone. But here at least is one point m which a hint might be taken with advantage, and that is that the appointments of General and Staff Officers in peace, so far from pre cluding them from the chance of employment in war, should carry with them the certainty that if their troops go they will go, and com mand the same corps in the field that they have been engaged in training during peace manoeuvres. Tnesoundnessofsuch an organisation admits of no controversy. That there would be difficulties in adapting the system to India obvious, but difficulties are made to bo ov„. come, and it cannot be beyond the talents of the Q. M. G.’s department in India to devise a mobilisation scheme that would reduce the present heterogeneous composition of the divi sions and brigades for service into something like o^er. Of course, it will take less time for the Director-General of Military Education to draw up a syllabus for another examination but—well, we should like to see the other tried for a change. For truly, “ of making courses there is no end, and much examination is a weariness of the flesh,” whilst the oft-repeated errors of pre-examination days have not entirely disappeared, but are still much in evidence in each successive campaign.

SASSOON MECHANICS’ • INSTITUTE. At the annual general meeting of the members of the Sassoon Mechanics’ Institute, held in the hall of the Institute on Thursday afternoon, Brigade-Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel G. Waters presided. The report for the year 1897-118 was laid before the meeting, from which the following excerpts are quoted :— would appear superfluous. Similarly, in the ease of an officer on or attached to a General’s Staff, the General has daily opportunities of watching his work and judging of his efficiency in more ways than come under the purview of an examiner ; and his report should be a truer guide than the result of an examination. Yet this does not appear to bej the case, or at all events it does not seem That the military authorities regard the reports on officers by Generals as by any means final or even approximately final tests of tbe value of the services of these officers in a military sense. Does the fault lie with the incredulity of the higher authorities, or the tendency of the lower Major Sturges has taken over the duties of Assistant Adjutant-General for Musketry from Colonel Hill. J Mr. Cobbold has arrived at Gilgit from the Pamirs none the worse for his adventures in the Oxus Valley. The committee of management have the pleasure ... submit to the members what they consider a satisfactory report of the proceedings connected with the institute during the past year. It is the first care of the committee to render the institute as useful and attractive as possible, and they are gratified to find that its benefits are preciated, as evinced by an increase of members. They e assured that from the point of view of general excellence and usefulness, the institute has steadily advanced. On the 31st March, 1898, there were 104 life members, 5 honorary life members, and 245 ordinary or quarterly members. Three life members having died, their uayies were removed from the list. The numbers last year were 107, 5, and 23(5, respectively. Three hundred and twelve visitors made use of the reading room and library during the year. The number last year was three hundred and thirty-three. This has always been, and must continue to be, the most important and prominent feature of the institute. As a first class public library with a very moderate subscription, it is entitled to the fullest support both private and official. The collection books and periodicals is most extensive. The com mittee have always received every assistance an 1 encour agement from Government. The institute has also been well supported by the public, and it has thus been enabled to provide a liberal supply of books and papers. 1 he number of books added to the library during the year was 398. At the close of the year the library contained 12,590 volumes. The number of old and new books circulated during the year was 39,500. The average number of books issued per day was 125. Seventy-four English, Continental, and Indian newspapers, magazines, &amp;c., were taken in during the year and circulated 24,330 times. The average number of issues per day was 78. The usual grant of Rs. 300 was received from Government towards the cost of lectures during the session. Three highly interesting lectures wer ■ delivered as under:—1st, “ Literature as a Mental Tonic,” by Professor M. Macmillan, B. A.; 2nd, i; The Sense of Taste,” by Mr. E. H. Aitken,; and 3rd , {i The Plague in Bombay,” by Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel T. S. VVeir. All the lectures were well attended, and much appreciated by the members and their friends. The com mittee take this opportunity of thanking the above three gentlemen for their interesting lecture. The lecture hall building fund (inclusive of the endowment fund. Rs. 7,908-12-10) now amounts to Rs. 17,201-0-11. There have been no important changes in the establish ment during the year under review, and the committee apprecii«ie the efficient work done by the staff, under the management of Mr. Quanbrough, the chief librarian and assistant secretary. In accordance with the usual custom, voting lists were circulated at the close of the year giving the names of the members eligible for - election. The voting lists were duly examined by the scrutineers, who reported the result to be as follows:—President—Brigade- Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel G. Waters ; Vice-Presidents— Khan Bahadur M. C. Murzban, C.I.E., F.R.I.B.A.. M. Inst., C. E., Mr. S. E. Shellim, and Mr. J. Wallace C. E., Directors—Mr. A. F. Turner, Mr. Watson, Mr. G. Lund, Mr. C. C. James, C. E., Mr. A. S. Sassoon, Mr. T. A. Savage, Mr. Byramjee N. Seervai, Rev. S. Leigh-Lye, Mr. Jamsetjee C. Jamsetjee, and Mr. C. E. Palmer ; Honorary Treasurer—Mr. J. P. Cornforth ; and Honorary Secretary—Mr. R. A. A. Jenkins. The financial position of the institute is satisfactory. There has been a net increase of Rs. 954-10 in the receipts as well as a slight increase of Rs. 209-9-1 in the disburse ments. It will be seen from the comparative statements of receipts and disbursements of the year under review with those of 189G-97 that the institute has benefited to the extent of Rs. 744-12-3 without any sacrifice of efficiency. The invested funds of the society amount to Rs. 24,000. The president, in proposing the adoption of the report, thanked the members for the honour they had done him in re-electing him to the presidency, and he complimented the office-bearers on the financial results obtained by careful and efficient ma nagement during the year under report. He said that the library had been pretty well supplied with books during the year and was well patronised. It was the great desire of the managing committee not only to make the library a source of instruction, but also of education, and with that object in view the selec tion of books would be carried out in future, and instead of choosing books of light literature, such as novels only, works on literature, travel, science, and so forth would also be included. The institution seemed to supply a distinct want in Bombay, and he hoped that it would go on year by year increasing in popularity, and fast become a social centre in this beautiful city. The report was adopted and the usual resolutions passed.■BHNBBBBfl BaBaBHBMD THE TIMES OF I^DIA. [August 13, 1898. hievous drivel.

This is oround upon which we do not propose to tread. But we think that much might be done to improve the existing state of affairs, without the introduction of any violent changes, or even the institution of a new examination. Most district commands as at present arranged contain isolated stations occupied by single regiments or even detachments. Such stations are too small to warrant frequent \isits from the District Commander, and it may be astly said that the General Officer Command- ng can make few opportunities of \ isiting these small cantonments without neglecting the interests of the bulk of his command. It xo, therefore, impossible that he should be equally well acquainted with the capabilities of officers serving in such stations as with those in more important and larger cantonments. This brings us to a point upon which we have frequently insisted—that isolated stations are detrimental to efficiency. Many, it is true, ha\e jeen abolished, and more might be under existing conditions of the country and the increased railway and telegraphic facilities foi rapid communication. But the ever present question of expense crops up. barrack accommodation must be new barracks built at heavy old being practically unsaleable purpose as a set-off against the Again, there are old treaties with Native States involving the maintenance of troops at various places, which cannot be set aside without difficulty and delay, and last, but not least, increased expense, as the removal of the troops would naturally entail the cessation of the contribution received from the States on their account. Still, great as the difficulties are, if the army is to be kept up to the modern scale of efficiency, they should be faced, and troops con centrated until a General Officer’s command becomes a reality as regards handling and knowing the troops in the district, and not, as at present, a Central Office for the transaction of the business of a large number of outlying stations, each containing an inconsiderable hand ful of men. The efficiency of all ranks would be increased by the emulation fostered by the proximity of other corps, whilst the possibility of the General making himself acquainted with the capabilities of those under his command would be largely increased. Such a change would probably lead to another, equally, if not more, important, in our opinion. The present mobilization scheme appears to be wanting in every element that tends to success. Generally speaking, it appears to start from the assumption that everyone who can be spared from the peace establishment should be the first to be mobilised for active service. In ntW words it begins to work on tlfij difference between the normal peace garrison and the compulsory garrison of each station, and provides for the mobilisation of these troops first. Commands and staff are then allotted on a principle—shall we say—of free selection, the limitation being that as few as possible of tbe General and St.df Officers, already selected for their appointments in peace time, should be given similar appointments in war. This seems an anomaly, and the result is still stranger. Itegiments collected from different commands are brigaded together under a General who may or may not have commanded a brigade in time of peace, and with whom none of them have ever worked before. Add to this a staff drawn from here, there, and everywhere, un known to the General, and probably unknown to most of the troops, with or without previous peace training ; and, to put it mildly, it is some time before the hastily put together machine works smoothly. That it works at all speaks highly for the adaptability of the British officers. For years the army has suffered from what may be called “ hasty Germanization on imperfectly-considered premises,” and many things have been copied that might well have THURSDAY’S BOMBAY “GOVERN MENT GAZETTE.” Mr. J.

Notable correspondents include Lieutenant-Colonel Malcolm John Meade, Captain Percy Molesworth Sykes, Albert Houtum-Schindler, Henry Mortimer Durand (British Minister at Tehran), John Richard Preece (British Consul at Ispahan), Thomas Henry Sanderson (Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), and Robert Theodore Gunther.Many of the letters discuss the internal affairs of Persia and British policy regarding that country, mostly from the perspective of British officers and diplomats who are residing or have visited there. Some of the correspondents congratulate Curzon on his recent appointment as Viceroy of India, a post which he took up in January 1899.Of particular note is an account by Horace Montagu Rumbold of his travels through Persia during October 1897, which records his observations and opinions of the country's government, its local rulers, and whether British rule of southern Persia would be welcomed by its inhabitants (ff 17-35).The file also includes copies of printed correspondence received by the Prime Minister, the Marquess of Salisbury (Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil), from British representatives in Constantinople (ff 50-52), which discuss a petition submitted by Count Kapnist, nephew of the Russian Ambassador at Vienna, to the Ottoman Minister for Public Works, in a bid for a concession for the construction of a railway line from the Mediterranean coast to the Persian Gulf (the correspondence includes a translation of the petition).The file concludes with newspaper cuttings from the
