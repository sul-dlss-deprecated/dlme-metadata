Message from Tchitcherin to the Workmen and Peasants of Bokhara and Khiva, 10th October, by Wireless :— Appeals to workmen of Bokhara and Khiva to follow the example of the peasant workers of Russia in their struggle for power. Documents seized from the Tsarist Government show that the Tsar, in conjunction with other European Powers, sought to subject Bokhara and Khiva to foreign rule, for this purpose sowing the seeds of civil war amongst their peoples. Persia, as a reward for trying to remain neutral, has become an English colony. Before the war Persia was divided between Russia and England. The Russian Workmen’s and Peasants’ Union declared Persia independent, and at once England seized the whole of Persia, what had been Russia’s part in addition to their own. Appeals to the workmen of Bokhara and Khiva, placed as they are between two conflicting forces, to turn from British Imperialism and join Red Russia and Red Turkestan in freeing themselves and all the workers of the Near and Far East from the yoke of the greedy European birds of prey. 1 1829.

Russian Government to bear cost of insuring Afghan goods against robbery in Russia. Market for “ All-Russia ” money very weak ; Bravin had to offer English promissory notes [all of which have been cancelled or withdrawn, as Afghan merchants, especially in Herat, know very well]. Russia hopes to export Ferghana silks, raw material, and later kerosene ; and to import sugar, tea, matches, medicine, and other European goods.

Afghans said that as the wagons we provided were only lit for cattle they insisted on first and second-class railway carriages being provided for them. A number of Afghans have arrived in Chihil Dukhtar. In view of all these facts we are taking all precautions against being cut off by these troops.

Mirza Mahomet replied that he would bring his detachment only as far as Yulatan, he and his otficers would come to Merv with small escort. 14923. M., 31st October. A Turkoman of note, who was sent by me to organise plan for capture of Suric’s party somewhere south of Yulatau, has returned here. He was unable to effect anything mainly on account of complete ascendancy gained by Afghans in whole region from Merv to Kushk. Afghans are doing everything possible to conciliate Turkoman. Men arrested by Bolsheviks are released, fines indicted are remitted, and hardships removed by order of Afghans, whom local Bolshevik officials implicitly obey. Xo Turkoman under stands situation, or whether Bolsheviks and Afghans are really friends or enemies.

Persia is given a prominent place in the Bolshevik programme in Asia because she affords good sail for sowing of Bolshevik ideas (owing to down-trodden condition of poor classes), and because Turkestan not being self-supporting needs the rich province of Khorassan : this, whether won by force or by propaganda, is a lure to Turkestan. 12065. Ah, 3rd September. Kasim Beg’s policy towards Persia. Pact that Shah went to Constantinople in British warship and was last heard of at Prinkipo has been seized on by Kasim Beg, who published widely that we have interned Shah for life as preliminary to annexing Persia. He argues that to save'Persia from falling into our hands, all good Mahometans should at once occupy any adjacent parts of Persia and so preserve them for Islam. l.S. 117o S., loth August. Ah, 0th August. Askabad agent had interview with Kasim Bog, who has started branch of his society “Muhammadan Communists ” in Askabad. Committee all Caucasus Turks. Object is nominally regeneration of Islam, but actually admitted to he destruction of all British power in the East. Kasim Beg says British, by occupying and destroying Holy Places and by turning St. Sophia into Christian Church are seeking to humble and annihilate Islam. He says he is one of a group of 24 under a vow to regenerate Islam and destroy British. Kasim Beg was three months in Khiva and worked wonders there, but his work has been rendered of no account by action of Amir of Bokhara. Kasim Beg ridicules talk of real peace between Afghanistan and British. Afghanistan is not yet quite ready (for Islamic movement), nor is India ripe.

In Kagan he is supervising activities of “ Young Bokhara” party and the training of political agitators. Persia has been sold to British, but time is at hand when from north and north-west, kingdom of the foolish and deported Shah will be invaded by vast Bolshevie and pan-Islam forces and the British expelled. Afghanistan will be given large slice of Korassan and Persian Baluchistan. Kasim Beg says he is on his way to Tashkend to meet German and Turkish friends. “ \Ye are gradually winning over American opinion, the recent Anglo-Persian treaty has alienated American and French Government who regard it as typical British Imperialism and treachery to Allies. I give you my strongest personal assurance that Bolshevics are real friends of Alahometans. I can tell you privately, but with authority, that Bolshevics are getting ready several fleets of aeroplanes and much heavy artillery for presentation to the heroic Amir Amanulla.” 2.

People who question Kasim Beg’s statement are liable to •punishment by Bolshevics, wl^o say Bolshevic influence in Turkestan lies in Mahometan sympathy, and that Kasim Beg’s efforts alone keep this alive. 14339.

They say it would not be necessary for British actually to enter Iranscaspia but that mere sending of British troops to Persian border opposite Kaakha or Ihishak would suffice to make Bolsheviks immediately evacuate Askabad, thus saving Krasnovodsk.

But that if left unaided by Peace Conference now, they and their co-religionists may forcibly be swept into the net of Bolshevism with results which no one can foretell.

Amir Amanulla, taking advantage of the golden opportunity, has won his rights at the point of the sword, and by achieving independence lias enormously increased his prestige and power, and that of Afghanistan, throughout Asia and the whole Mahometan world. That countiy is now a real power for the British to recognise. Its geographical, nidi tan and economic situation is such as to make the Soviet (lovernment of Russia strain every nerve to establish the most intimate alliance with it, and to assist it in every way with a view to compassing the downfall of the British power in Asia, and indeed throughout the world. ll.O.l., Sinna, oth Septembei. 1 he Russian military schools are being used ior the training of agents for spreading Bolshevik theories in India, Persia and all Asia.

Reports from all quarters make it clear that Afghan officials have everywhere published most misleading versions of Peace Treaty. The generally received versions of Afghan case is as follows: (a) Afghans were victorious in actual fighting and penetrated far into India ; ( 6 ) Government of India, in view oi defeat in field, desertions and mutiny of Indian troops, and unrest and even risings in internal India, sued for peace ; (c) Afghans agreed to six months’ armistice on condition of recognition of complete independence of all control, doubling of subsidy, large gifts of money and arms, recognition of Afghan suzerainty over frontier tribes, and large territorial concessions in India, together with freeing Indian Mahometans from alleged British oppression. All these conditions to be carried out within six months. 2. It is obvious that these persistent misleading reports have had bad effect. 3. I gather from many enquiries that should Bolshevik assistance be on sufficiently large scale, Aighans may after some months make impossible demands on us, and, on our refusal, make another attempt at Jehad, based on the grounds that we have refused to honour the alleged conditions of the armistice, as outlined in para. 1 above. 4. I have persistent reports of Afghan propaganda in Eastern Persia, and in Russian territory during the last few weeks. This seems undoubtedly to be due to recent orders from Kabul, as during past summer very little was done by Afghans in this direction. The result of this Afghan agitation is to strengthen local opinion regarding the probable purely temporary character of peace. o. I am, of course, taking all possible steps to counteract Afghan and Bolshevik propaganda, but gist of above as reasons for the strongly field opinion in these parts that peace will not last. 199 G*26 13818.

All autho rities concerned are alive to the' importance of intercepting Bolshevik agents and literature. On our land frontiers both Gilgit and Kashmir are on qui mye, and latter is working in close touch with local Chinese authorities for suppression of Bolshevik propaganda.

At the ports we rely on rigid passport system, with prosecution when necessary, and expulsion of suspicious foreigners. It is of course, impossible entirely to keep-out Bolshevik literature, which can reach us almost as easily from England or America as from countries still under censorship. If movement gains ground m India we can only employ ioice to suppress^^ards counter measures, we disseminate anti-Bolshevik propaganda both by wireless outside India and in the Press whenever opportunity presents itself. * Co-operation of religious and conservative parties in country will possum prove of assistance. n , . , -i i • But with our vast frontier we must rely m the main on tne evil being tapped at its source bv means of intelligence systems at all chief centres of Bolshevik activities,- thereby facilitating detection of agent(s) and schemes, devising ' preventive measures and preparation of _ suitable counter propaganda W e ourselves are attempting to set up one such intelligence agency at lashkend, no a apparently most active centre where India is concerned.

Evidence tends to suggest ' that Bolsheviks, having failed in Europe, intend to concentrate on Asia with India as main objective, and C.U.P. as their allies.

Mission would consist of four Indian Moslems, say, one 1.C.S I.M.S. and . .I.D., and one Mullah with a clerk or two, and entrance could be found lor it na Baku or Petrovsk.

I do not) dunk that it is desirable, or that it would lead to useful results, for following reasons (a) It would be difficult for personnel of such mission unless they had some local knowledge of Cential Asia, and modern Persia, knew some Russian or Turki, to get through Bokhara either from O.P. side or from here in present circumstances. Their best chances 'would be from here a^d I might get them through one at a time at considerable personal risk. (b) Presence of such mission would inevitably very soon become known in Bokhara, where Bolsheviks have official representative and very numerous spies. (V) Mission would compromise Amir w hilst doing us little or no good. Amir has behaved very well in trying circumstances, and his policy of careful outward neutrality and intolerance of all agitation is that recommended by me. He understands that we can give him no armed assistance, and m these circumstances he is doing as much for us as we can reasonably expect. Bolsheviks on learning presence of mission would certainfv demand its surrender, thereby placing Amir in awkward predicament lor tins reason alone I think Amir would not care to receive mission, and I do not consider it would be fair to ask him to do so. id) Secretary of State’s suggestion that object (of) proposed mission would be to collect intelligence and organise counter-propaganda. He is appa rently not aware that I am in touch with Amir and receive frequent communications from correspondents in Bokhara. I think that intelli gence is pretty good. As regards propaganda, ours holds the field Afghan and Bolshevik lies are not believed. The Mullahs of Bokhara detest Bolsheviks and give no encouragement to Pan-Islam agitators. (e) Apart from certain Indian traders whom 1 believe to be loyal, and two men of the Guides placed there by me, I know of no Indian residents in Bokhara. Certainly no Indian agitators have been reported there One Afghan representative is in Bokhara, but Afghan agitators are told to move on. if) Presence of such mission, apart from other objection, would be likely to actually harm intelligence service, as Bolsheviks would be more than ever on look-out to intercept our messengers. o. It is very difficult to suggest means whereby we can avert coming dancer, ropaganda is useful, but will go down before large battalions when they arnve. have always been of opinion that employment of quite small British'force at any time between last October and April would have gone far towards makirm Central Asia secure and might have averted Afghan war. But time for active intervention has (corrupt group) finally passed with our withdrawal from Jvrasnovodsk and the Caucasus. .Only alternative is that already suggested in my telegram No. o20fH &lt; ated Oh August, para 2 , namely, to announce that British Government will iihe all its influence at Peace Conference to secure (a) complete independence of Bokhara with restoration ol Samarkand and dizzak areas taken away bv Russia • ( &gt;) absolute autonomy for Transeaspia and for the remainder of provinces of I urkestan under arrangements to be locally decided by popular vote. Result of declaration would, in my opinion, be to rally all Central Asian Mahometans to our sioe and would completely take wind out of sails of Pan-Islamic agitators It would not probably suffice to stop large forces of Bolsheviks comiim down from the Orenburg side. But a hostile population counts for mudf especially m the matter of supplies, and though the military value of all the C entra Asian Mahometan(s) is not great, especially as they are unorganised and without .utd eiy, they would be able if encouraged by us to do much to render Bolshevik schemes more difficult. ^mier 5. I have already recommended (vide my telegram 02019 of 30th July) t hat we should endeavour to save starving Turkoman from falling into Bolshevik ami an-Islamic nest by giving them financial assistance. 1 have had no rerdv to this telegram. The goodwill of Turkoman is specially necessary to us from an intelligence point of view, as without their help it would he almost impossible to get news through from the various places in Central Asia. This financialassistance could largelv l)e given by raising and training from amongst Turkoman refugee(s) already mounted and armed, a force which might soon be 2,000 strong. Such troops would be useful for raids on Bolshevik lines of communication, and some employment would circulate money amongst Turkoman and bind them to our side. 0 . Whatever policy is adopted and announced, we should be prepared scrupulously to adhere to. There is no doubt a withdrawal (? from) various parts of former Russian Empire, coming on top of local experience, is giving us character of being selfish and unstaple and of leaving our allies “ in the cart when our immediate purposes have been served. While deprecating proposed mission to Bukhara, 1 should welcome any really abnormal and reliable agents suitable for Central Asian intelligence work. System here was abandoned and broken up early in war and it is difficult to improvise, especially in view of grave personal dangers of work. Only men ready to take risks and able to successfully disguise their vocation will be of use. 8 . Finally, I think that in order to maintain British prestige and provide lor steadying factor in this area, we should maintain here strong mixed force. 5,000 men of all arms, provided with aeroplane(s) and other modern accessories, would neutralise all Western Afghanistan, keep Khorassan absolutely quiet, and afford strong moral support to our friends in Central Asia. Such a force would not be beyond the capacity of existing lines of communication, especially if railway was at once pushed on to Neh. With Malleson’s criticism of suggested mission we are in entire agreement. We agree also that best plan would be to strengthen his intelligence system by addition (of) one or two first-class agents, and will do our best to assist him in procuring them. 358. 10th September. Your telegram of the 1st instant. Bolshevik force in Turkestan at present consists mainly of prisoners of war and is of low morale ; we do not consider it capable of intervening in Afghanistan or Persia without strong reinforcements. Moreover, latest information indicates that Denikin &lt;s reinforcing Transcaspia with two battalions and two batteries. Distance from Orenburg to Tashkend is over 1,100 miles, and taking into consideration severity of winter, shortage of rolling stock, and damage done to railway north of Aral Sea during its occupation by Cossacks, it seems improbable that any appreciable reinforcements properly organised and equipped for active operations can reach Tashkend before next spring. 2. Necessary preliminary to active intervention in Persia would be recon ciliation of hostile elements in Turkestan, but Bokharans are definitely anti- Bolshevik and remainder of indigenous population are in the main hostile. Pacification of country will take time unless effected by force, and we consider use of force unlikely as calculated to rouse hostility of neighbouring Moslem countries. 8 . We must, however, expect anti-British agitation to increase in intensity and be mainly directed to stir up Afghanistan and Persia against us with, extravagant promises of active assistance. One great danger in this direction appears to be activities of (? Turk) Kasim Beg who by his political connections can appeal with greater chance of success to Moslem elements. It does not appear likely to us that Afghans, as a whole, would welcome Bolshevik intervention involving entry into Afghanistan. 4. Actual invasion of Persia appears to us unlikely unless there is sudden development there of active anti-British campaign by Persians, of which at present there is no sign, if it were contemplated, only feasible routes for adequate force are (a) via Askabad and Kuchan, and (b) via Krasnovodsk and Astrabad ; former presupposes ability] to defeat Malleson’s force and latter is scarcely feasible, without control of Caspian Sea. Bolsheviks in Transcaspia are notoriously fearful of our troops, and if Malleson's force were reinforced, up to what we can now maintain from present rail-head, namely, one regiment of cavalry, one battery of artillery, and two battalions, we consider it should deter Bolsheviks from entering Persia, for difficulties of transport preclude possibility of invasion in any force. 5. Should evacuation of the Caucasus by us lead to loss of command of the Caspian Sea by Denikin, situation will be materially altered, for chaotic conditions of area would react on Persia, with resulting difficulties anticipated and3D Bolsheviks would obtain alternative line via Astrakhan and freedom of access to Persian coast. 0. As general conclusion, we consider Bolsheviks will confine themselves to intense propaganda, not undertaking military operations against Persia as long as w'e maintain force in Khorassan and retain command of the Caspian Sea. 7. We have no objection to Malleson visiting Tehran, but suggest that this duty would more appropriately devolve upon the officer selected as President of Military Mission, vide Cox’s telegram of Jlth August to Foreign Office. 8 . As your telegram under reply was not addressed to Cox, Telnan, we are- not repeating to him.
