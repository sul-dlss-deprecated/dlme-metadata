Tronson confirms that he has delivered the bag of 600 German crowns to the Native Agent at Shargah [Sharjah], Moolah Hussein [Mullah Husain], and goes on to provide information regarding relations between some of the Arab chiefs. Tronson states that he delivered the Resident's letter to the Shaik [Sheikh Said bin Tahnun Al Nahayan] of Abothabee [Abu Dhabi] and impressed upon him the necessity of taking active measures to capture the pirate, Saheil ben Atish. Tronson reports that he has visited the islands of Surdy [Sirrī] and Seir Abonaid [Şīr Bū Nu‘ayr]; he found no one at Surdy and only a few poor fishermen at Seir Abonaid, who informed him that the pirate had visited the island about six weeks ago and robbed them of everything they had. This letter is stated as being a true extract, signed by John Patterson Porter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711592.0x000014#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
