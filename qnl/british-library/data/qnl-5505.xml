(E 3636/Y57/G) | 19 41 28th July, 1941., ^ / ^ &lt;/ 28th July, 1941., Dear Peel, Since you wrote me your letter of the 11th June, on the subject of propaganda in Afghanistan and Iran, the main questions to which you referred have, I think, either been settled or else have been carried a stage further and do not require any special observations from me* There is, however, just one point in your letter which seems to require fuller consiaeration and that is the suggestion in the Government of Inaia* s telegram No. 2613, of the 3rd June, that La jor—General V/.A.Kr Fraser, the new Military Attache at Tehran, should be in direct charge of propaganda and intelligence. I do not quite understand what the Government of India mean by this proposal, but if it means that the Military Attache at Tehran should be the head of all propaganda and intelligence activities in Iran, I fear that the Foreign Office could not agree to such a proposal. The control of intelligence and propaganda does not usually fall within the province of our military attaches. As regards propaganda, Sir Reader Bullard has, as you know, an efficient Press Attache who would seem to be the right person to direct propaganda. As regards intelligence, there are other arrangements in force which are understood to be working well, and it is of course very unusual and generally highly undesirable that a Military Attache, whose normal functions entail cooperation with the iocal General Staff and are altogether open and above-board, should be responsible for secret service work. However, I am sure that General Fraser, whom I knew well in Iran many years ago, is the last person who would wish to create difficulties for Sir Reader Bullard by trying to assume functions v/hich are not really his concern. 2 J JUt *941 INDIA OFFICE■■■I Desp* 2055/30.

Vs 7 T €} The Government of India's telegram of the 3rd June deals with the question of propaganda and intelligence in Iren and Afghanistan with particular reference to Iran where they stress the importance of early action to counter long -'foreign ^forma^ionJurJau “now ^^^^hfs^ureaS ? ira°nf the main difficulties, both in Iran and Afghanistan, ifthe distri^tTon of propaganda in view of the attitude against it taKen up by both these Governments, and the only way to secure distribution is to buy our way against opposition. For this purpose they are prepared to increase expenditure on the Bureau -loz-hs as originally proposed to 10 lakhs. They also PU est' : a a the best way of securing harmony between the Government of India and the Tehran Legation, which has always been inclined to be auspicious of Indian interference in Iran, would be the appointment of a high grade military attache'who would take over the control of propaganda and intelligence. They suggest fo this appointment the name of Major General W.A.K. Fraser who has recently been released from his command at Basra. It has been he had eiven up his command at Basra owing to ill heluh but it Is In lo cale possible that he would not find the duties and climate at Tehran so exacting as those at Basra. I be is fit physically he seems an excellent choice for the • + n + pQ he w as a thorough knowledge of the language and the country and las serfed as Military Attache', Tehran with credit from 1924 to 1928. The Commander-in-Chief, India has telegraphe War Office supporting this proposal, see copy of the telegram attached. The overnment of India have for some time been anxious to have some representative of the Government of India in Iran and they suggested Cst September that an Indian Political officer should be posted to the Tehran Legation in order to act as a sort of liason officer. The Minister at Tehran, however, saw objections to the Proposal a the suggestion has come to nothing, see papers flagged in the file below. The appointment of General Fraser to iehran as mill a ^ Attache^to control propaganda and intelligence should largely mee the Government of India’s requirements. From our point of view the Government of India's proposals =eem very satisfactory but Iran is, of course, a Foreign Ofuce fl eld and we shall have to consult them in the first place. It is hoped, however that they will not be obstructive in the matter and will walcome’the Government of India's proposals, especially as it appears from Mr. Hennessy’s telegram that the new Bureau was set up at the express request of the Ministers in Afghanistan and Iran. The War Office may also have something to say on the Government of India's suggestion that the Military Attache' should have control of lot! iHelllgSnce and propaganda,but it may be that this will fit in quite well with existing arrangements. The last three paragraphs of the Government of India’s telegram deal with Persian broadcasts from Delhi, the question of a subsidy lor pritish film publicity in Iran and the possibility of an Arabic broadcast from Delhi. These are mainly matters for Mr. Hushorook-Williams and we°shall no doubt receive his observations on them. The Viceroy’s orivate tele-ram of the 2nd June, of which a copy is attached^ stresses the urgency of this matter and the desirability of seeing that intelligence and propaganda in this field go hand in hand. The Viceroy hopes that eventually it will be possible to co-ordinate publicity, possible from Iran, throughout the whole area of Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan using the Publicity Bureau as the agent. bucn a development would no doubt be highly desirable but we do not want to make any suggestion of this xind to the Foreign Of-i-ice at this stage. A draft letter to Mr. Baxter of the Foreign Office consulting him is submitted. LM iLmmm / /- Draft Paper. px X ° ^5- — tpf. EXTERNAL Department. DrtAFT LliTTEit C./V.

(. 1 .A. y 18 JUN mi Would you^iplease refer to the Government of N ' India's telegram cjf the 3rd June, No.2613, on the subject of propaganda in Afghanistan and Iran, a copy of which was sent to you ori the 4th June under this Office No. Ext.3063/41. ; This correspondence arose originally from an enquiry addressed to the Government of India on ! the 29th March by the Secretary of State, who desired to be assured that the Minister in Kabul now had at his disposal all the funds necessary for propaganda purposes, and asxed for a brief telegraphic report on the situation generally. The Government of India in their I’gply of the 4rtii April, No.1550, said that they had sanctioned extra finds for Fraser-Tytler to the extent of 1,39,000 Rupees peb annum and in addition had sanctioned the sum of 3^ lakhs for their new Foreign Information Bureau&gt; mainly for the supply of propaganda literature etc. in French, English and Persian, which owing to the present attitude od the Afghan Government would have to be distributed at ihe outset across the frontier from India. 2. The Government of India's present telegram takes the matter further. The Foreign Information Bureau is now working and material is being produced which is designed not only for Afghanistan but also for Iran. The main difficulty ini both countries is that of distribution, and in order to buy our way against opposition, the Government of Indict are prepared to increase the 3i lakhs i which they had sanctioned for the Bureau to 10 lakhs per (10337) Wt.l40D4/P.164 10,000 3/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 (11764) Wt.2Q696/P.282 10,000 9/39 annum/annum. They further propose that in order to secure harmony of view and effort between the G-overnment of India and the Tehran Legation, a high grade military attache^ should be deputed from India to Tehran and they suggest the name of Major General W.A.K. Fraser who has recently been released from his command at Basra. General Fraser has already had experience of the post of Military Attache^ Tehran from 1924 to 1928 and is said to have performed his duties to the satisfaction of the Minister and the Military Authorities and to have earned the respect of the Persian Authorities. He was also at one time in tKe' SouthTTersTan nifles^ m±a has a thorough Knowledge of the language and of the country. 3. So far as we here are concerned the Government of India’s proposals seecyhighly satisfactory and we would strongly support the appointment of General Fraser as Military Attached We have no doubt that the Foreign Office will fully share the views of the Government of India as to the great importance of early action to improve and extend our propaganda in Iran where German pressure has long been very great. The question of propaganda in Iran is, of course, primarily a matter for the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Informat ion, and we should be glad to receive your comments on the proposals made in the Government of India’s telegram. We understand that the Government of India’s new Bureau was set up at the request of the delegations in Kabul and Tehran (see Hennessy’s telegram to Joyce of the 3rd March, No.1042) and presumably therefore Bullard will welcome an extension of its activities in Iran as well as in Afghanistan. You will notice that the Government of India consider that the Propaganda and Intelligence Agencies should work in close collaboration and propose that the new Military Attache' should be in direct charge of both propaganda and intelligence. This seems sound in principle but I am not quite certain how this would work in with existing arrangements and it may be that the War office will have some views on this point.4. The last three paragraphs of the Government of India's telegram would appear to be mainly a matter for dushbrook-irVilliams^ to whom I am sending a copy of this letter and he will no doubt have some comments to offer upon them. a-l-eo sanding a-oopy of fhi«—4ret'ter to ^)f I ■ ■» A~r (Sgd.)

I am anxious to emphasise the very great importance as it seems to me of pressing on urgently with Intelligence and Propaganda, particularly in Iran, where the German threat is very great and interposes dangers between our forces in Iraq and India. 3. Dustrust between the F.o. end India over Iran has been historical ^oing back to ivaleolra’s time, but I think the appointment of first rate military attache should be the best immediate solvent. Conn.ander-in-Chief is very ready to release Fraser, who has admirable qualities for this task; the sooner he can join at Tehran the better, articulariy in view of the friction between Bullard and mderwood, the present military attache. 8 4. As things develop I hope it should be possible to co-ordinate publicity, possibly from Tehran, throughout the area of Iraq, Iran ana Afghanistan and we will work to this end using our publicity Bureau as agent. b.

Reference to previous correspondence Description of Enclosure.r-p-z: ; '&lt;,nq W nj 9th April,1938. My Lord, I have the honoiir to inform you that Colonel yhus ,late Military Attache to this ^.egation,prior to his departure expressed the wish that I should seek to obtain for him a parting interview with the Shah,an honour that had been granted to some^possibly to all of his predecess ors , including Colonel Dodd whom colonel pybus relieved here. 2. Upon consulting precedent,! found that although there seemed some doubt as to previous practice, Colo :el Dodd had certainly been granted an audience on departure, and that it appeared to be the custom also for the new Military Attache to be presented to His imperial Majesty. As on this occasion Colonel Underwood was to overlap with Colonel ?ybus for several days,! wrote to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs a letter encjiiring whether the Shahjiwould grant the customary interviewfor on this occasion combine them in one. I enclose a copy of my letter. At the same time I spoke to the Head of the Protocol Department and asked his good offices in the sub mission of my request to the Shah in the most appropriate manner. 3. Having received no reply two days previous to Colonel X^ybus 1 departure,but having heard from the protocol Department that the Ministry had communicated with the Court,! called upon Monsieur Anaarie to ascertain the posi tion. After some telephoning,he went to see Monsieur Adi. /On The Kight Honourable, The Viscount Halifax,K. &amp;• ,G.C.S.I.,■nhpmm - 2 - 2&gt;) On return he told me that a oopy of niy letter had teen sent to the Court under cover of a letter from the Ministry which put to the Shah the question of the principle of His Imx^erial Majesty receiving foreign Military Attaches personally. An answer had now heen received thorb the Shah did not feel that he could extend to the incoming or out:oing British Military Attache,a privilege that he did not give to the Military Attaches of other countries. The privileged Military Attache at Tehran is now the Turk: it is a fact that neither he nor the French Military Attache had the honour of an Audience with the Shah on arrival. 4 # Monsieur Ansarie suggested that the interviews given to Colonel Dodd and to Colonel Pyfcus on his arrival were exceptional and should not he considered as preced ents. I told Monsieur Ansarie that my firm belief v/as that these interviews had not been isolated cases but had been in accordance with practise,and I expressed regret that a traditional and greatly valued personal contact with His Imperial Majesty should now be broken. From informa tion derived from another source it seems doubtful whether my request for interviews for Colonel Pybus and Colonel Underwood was actually put before the Shah. 5* I am sending copies of this despatch to the Seei*etary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department.

Ae regards the proposal made in the last paragraph of your letter under reply, the Council desire to point out, that, as they h=ve no knowledge of the record or qualification; of officers of the Indian Army, a comparison between them and British Army Officers is not easy. They would, however, have no objection to considering a recommendation made by the secretary of tate for India, in regard to an officer ?.ho is thought specially suitable for a particular Military Attacheship. If the officer were appointed, it is presumed that one Staff appointment or Command in the Indian Army in excess of the proportion agreed to in 1930, will be given to a Colonel of the British Army, and held for such period a^ the po^t of Military Attache is held by an officer of the Indian Army, The nnder Secretary of State for India, otherwise/ Military Department, India Office, London, S.*.l.A otherwise British Funds would hnve tempor arily to be ,r the co. t of an additional Colonel on half-pay to &gt;hich the Council coul i ot agree* I am.

Would you please refer to the J&amp;) - correepondence ending with Army Department telegram dated 29th June, No.323, about the appointment of Abe ietant Military Attache, Teheran? The Foreign Office were a little dieturbed to find that such short notice of the selection of Captain Cooper had been given to Sir R. Clive. We understand that although it may not be usual to give Ministers long notice of the selection of Assistant Military Attaches in the ordinary course, the Legation at Teheran is so small and self-contained that it is a matter of some importance that the Minister should be given a chance of expressing his views before any selection relating to his staff is finally made. Perhaps this could be borne in mind. Yours 8cc . G.R.Tottenham Esq.,ICS. Government of India, Army Department. Political Secretary to Seen, thanks, (Sd.)S.K .BROWN. see after issue.

Your letter was the first which we had heard of this appointment. 7/e are now telegraphing to the Government of India to ask for further y information regarding it, and I ^ will write to you again at once as soon as we get their reply, jf' I might-pcrhap-s explain 'AiaL t3ur Military Department wrote to the Government of India on the 17th May to ask them to reconsider the general question of the desirability of retaining an Assistant Military Attache in the light of the views expressed d on the subject by the Offeree-'' andr-bnr Clive; but this letter will, of course, have reached them only after they had issued posting orders to Cooper. hJk am not quite clear what the normal practice is as regards notifying the Minister of the posting of the/J the Assistant Military Attache, but clearly - if only as a matter of courtesy - some prior intimation • &lt; ought to have been made to him, v ^ ' pa^Ureurlarly in view uf the fact c * • • that he had expressed himself on the geg^r^-Jfa&lt;»g^ii5Tr-i; f the -ayaointmant. (Sd.)i*C. WALTON( i5. f p ^ brL FOREISN OFFICE, S. t.l 4th June, 1929. * r\ I enclose herein a copy of Clive's telegram Ho. 216 of May 15, regarding the appointment of Captain Cooper, R.A.S.C., as Assistant Military Attache at Tehran. The War Office can throw no light on this appointment. The first they heard of it was a telegram from India, 'which announced Captain Cooper's t « selection as an*accomplished fact. They inform us that they passed on to India Clive's views regarding the insufficiency of work; for a Military Attache and an Assistant Military Attache, which were explained in paragraph 4 of our official letter of February 11 to the War Office, a copy of which was sent to you on February 12. But as the cost of the appointment falls entirely on Indian funds, the War Office state that they have really no say in the matter. We/ J,C„ Walton, Wsq.. , M.C.3920 L 1929 We shall 'be grateful if you will look into the matter, and take what action you think necessary to enable us to reply to Clive's enquiry. It seems to us not quite customary for such an appointment to be made without consulting, or even informing either Clive or the Foreign Office - seeing that it runs somewhat counter to Clive's recommendation. But this is a point which we don't for a moment wish to press.CO? - '. fE 2463/271/34) f— 7 3920 I j q o 9 • DI3T.UBUTI0U. i Decode. Sir R. Clive (Tehran). 15th May, 1929.
