We hope you will agree that the procedure suggested whereby the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, will give an appropriate certificate, is acceptable. If you do we shall be glad if immediate arrangements could be made to put it in force. As regards the form of certificate suggested by Customs and Excise, which is to the effect that 'This guano was collected on Island', we can see that it is desirable that the BoUtical Officer should give a certificate in this form whenever he can but in some cases it may not be possible for him to satisfy himself with reasonable certainty that the guano was collected from a particular island. In such circumstances he may have to modify the certificate as he thinks appropriate and say, for example, 'This guano is declared by to have been collected from Island. Island is regarded by His Majesty^ Government as belonging to , a territory under the protection of His Majesty.' The Political Officer could make the above statement even if a conflicting claim to the island existed on the part of, say, Saudi Arabia, provided we recognise the island as belonging to one of the territories under our protection. If, however, the Political Officer were not sure whether a particular island was regarded as belonging to a territory under our protection, the best course would be for him to refer the case for decision. We shall be grateful for an early reply. v.e are sending a copy of this letter to Longhurst of Customs and Excise. Yours ever EASTERN DEPARTMENT. The Residency, BAHREIN.COPY (E 12838/1121/91) 32585/49 CUSTOMS AM) EXCISE, CITY GATE HOUSE, PIIISBURY SQUARE, LOUDON, E.C.2. 24 th October, 1949. Dear Rogers, We spoke on Friday about Persian Gulf guano which the firm of C. Gilbert Ltd., Columbia House, Aldwyeh, E.C.2. are arranging to import into the United Kingdom. We are told that this stuff is to be shipped from Abu Dhabi on the Trucial Oman Coast, which we understand to be a territory under the protection of His Majesty, and, therefore, included in the British Empire for purposes of the grant of Imperial Preference. If, then, the guano was ”grown or produced” at Abu Dhabi, and con signed direct therefrom to this country, it would be eligible for admission duty free under Preference. Our information is, however, that the material will be^ collected on some of the islands off the mainland - some uninhabited and little more than rocks forming bird sanctuaries - and taken in small boats to Abu Dhabi for shipment. Only, therefore, if the islands from which the guano is collected are themselves included in the British Empire for Preference purposes (i.e. under the protection of H*M. Government) would the Imported goods qualify for preference; and it is the difficulty of determining the status of the particular islands, and of securing satisfactory certificates of origin for guano collected at 'entitled” places, which the importer is faced with in this case. I understand from Perry that you have suggested that we should accept the testimony in this matter of your Local Political Officer on the spot, who would have full knowledge of the facts, and that his testimony should take the form, of a certificate (or endorsement) to the effect where such is the case, that 'this guano was collected on (Name Island)which is under the protection of H.M. Government, .... which would be furnished with each consignment and identified therewith. We should be very happy to adopt this proposal and I should be most grateful, therefore, if you would put in train the necessary arrangements with the Political Otficer concerned o this end. We understand that shipments of the guano to the United Kingdom are to commence very shortly and it would be appreciated, therefore, if you would confirm the arrangement in writing at the earliest possible moment so that I can inform the importers of our detailed requirements for documentation of claims to Imperial Preference made in respect of the goods. Yours sincerely, T.E. Rogers, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.1. (Sgd) (D.F. Longhurst)s . §, 2 Secret.

I assume that the British importer -will eventually appoint a responsible agent in Abu Dhabi to handle the consignment and who will keep me informed as to the shipments he is making.^ 3. I know that Abu Dhabi subjects collect guano from the islands rocks and reefs between their territory and Qatar p.nd I propose to issue the second form of certificate described in paragraph 5 of Eastern Department’s letter when the case arises. Short of frequently visiting the mass of inaccessible islands. I do not see that I can be more definite. It should suffice the Customs and Excise to know that the guano has been collected by Abu Dhabi subjects from islands belonging either to Abu Dhabi or to Qatar. C.J.

Dear Eastern Department, We have learnt that guano has been obtained by some Bahrain merchants from the island of Anaibar at the southern end of the Gulf of Salwa. This island is claimed by Saudi Arabia and the Bahrain merchants have been warned by the Saudi Arabian authorities to remove no more guano from it. The guano has been exported to the United Kingdom, India, Ceylon ^nd Italy, am we enclose a list giving such details of the various consignments as we have been able to obtain. It would not be possible to certify that this guano has been collected irom an island which is regarded by His Majesty’s Government as belonging to a territory under the protection of His Majesty in accordance with the procedure last referred to in our letter 150/2/50 of the 16th January since so far as we are aware the island in question has not up to date been daimed by either the Ruler of Bahrain or the Ruler of Qatar. It is shown in the Persian Gulf Chart at latitude 24° 55* and longitude 50° 47' Yours ever, The Eastern Department, The Foreign Office, London, b.W.1.
