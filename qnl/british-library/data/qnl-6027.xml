No. }{/\S5 C&amp;f'*) September, 1948. TVu^ J I enclose an extract from a letter which was passed on to me by His Highness the Shaikh about the employment of personal bodyguard of Pakistanis. I know His Highness mentioned it to Sir Rupert on one of his visits here and Sir Rupert approved the plan, but I cannot find that anything has been recorded about it. As you will see all arrangements about pay and terns of service of these men have been made, and the matter is just hanging fire in absence of the formal approval by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pakistan. His Highness does not wish the matter taken up on a very level , • official^ as these bodyguards will be purely his personal servants, but he asked me if we could get in touch with somebody in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who could give the requisite permission. &lt;5~MJV3 L { Major A.L.A.

OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONED FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM Chamber of Commerce Building Wood Street, KARACHI. 16th May, 1949. Dear Residency, Your letter No.141/9/49 of the 2nd May about recruit ment of Pakistanis for the bodyguard of the Sheikh of Kuwait• 2. although the Pakistan Government have made no pronouncement on the general question of the recruitment of Pakistani nationals abroad, thjey have refused permi ssion in the case of the ^en Police Force, and the Police and Jail Services of Hong Kong. We also learn indirectly that permission to recruit for the Hong Kong Naval Dockyard Foldce - an Admiralty responsibility has liKewise been refused. 3. No reasons have been ^iven for this policy, but we understand on fairly good authority that it has been adopted because the Pakistan Government do not wish to incur the odium which would inevitably result, should their nationals become en raged in the suppression of 'popular* agitation in other Asiatic countries. In the circumstances, we imagine that if you ever rret a reply from the Pakistan Government, it will be a refusal. If you wish, we will of course ask what has happened to your enquiry, but in view of the fact that the Sheikh has now abandoned the project of Pakistani recruitment, we do not propose to do so unless we hear from you.
