His Majesty’s Government have therefore no objection to the Russian Govern ment constructing a line to Tehran, and, subject to all the reserves and conditions already stipulated as to the route of the railway outside the Russian sphere, and that it shall not, without agreement with His Majesty’s Government, proceed beyond the Russian sphere, have authorised His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to co-operate with his Russian colleague to secure the said option for the Societe d’Etudes. The British group of the Societb d’Etudes hare also been informed that they would be justified in sending to Tehran a representative to co-operate with represen tatives of the other groups of the societe to the same end. As regards the suggestion that the societe should be encouraged to make a big loan to the Persian Government, such action appears somewiiat difficult, as there is to be no Anglo-Russian guarantee.

Memorandum respecting Trans-Persian Railway communicated to the Foreign Office, August 12, 1912. AT a, meeting held in Paris on the 27th July, the conseil d’administration of the Societe d’Etudes du Chemin de Fer transpersan discussed the stfeps to be taken for furthering the objects of this company. It was decided, in the first place, that representatives of the three groups should I be deputed to proceed shortly to Tehran in order jointly to request the Persian Government, on behalf of the Societe d’Etudes, to grant permission for carrying out the survey works in Persian territory necessary for the study of a project for linking up the Russian and Indian railway systems. This line of railway would extend from the Russian frontier at Astara to the Perso-Beluchistan frontier near or at Guattar. The projected line would pass through Tehran, but in other respects the intermediate points of alignment would be left open to study by the survey parties and to subsequent decision by the Societe d’Etudes after due consultation with the interested Govern ments, whose approval to the alignment would be necessary to the promoters before proceeding to construction. It was further decided at the Paris meeting on the 27th July that a sum of 250,000 fr. should be voted by the Societe d’Etudes from the funds at its disposal to form a provisional advance on the estimates drawn up by the Russian and French engineers for survey works contemplated in Northern Persia by the Russian group. In view of the attitude adopted towards the trans-Persian scheme by the Ministers of the Crown in debates which took place in the House of Lords on the 15th July last, and in the face of the prevailing conditions of insecurity in Southern Persia, the British group did not feel justified in advancing any proposal for a money grant from the Societe d’Etudes on account of surveys in the southern regions of Persia, where it was determined to postpone all action in this connection for the present. For the information of the Foreign Office, copy of a letter addressed by the president of the Societe d’Etudes to M. Khomiakof, the vice-president of the Russian group in the company, is herewith enclosed, from which the first steps contemplated and desired by the societe as a whole will be observed. 8, Bishopsgate, London, August 9, 1912.

CONFIDENTIAL. [31859J [July 29. j Section 2. Slv G. Buchanan to Sit Edwavd Gvey.—(Received July 29 ) (No. 229. Confidential.) Sir, THE Minister for Foreign Affairs passed on his way to the Fmnisii Skerries, where the Sweden to-morrow, and was good enough to granl afternoon. Our conversation followed much the same lines as that which I had had with the President of the Council a few days previously, on which I reported in my despatch {v No - 226 °* the l8th mstant - Sazonof expressed much satisfaction at hearing how cordial were the sentiments entertained for Russia in England, but said that he had been painfully surprised by the tone of Lord Cu rzon’s recent speech in the House of Lords. He had tiusted that the old suspicions with which Russia used to be reo’arded were now dead and buried, and yet here was a statesman who might occupy the post of Secretay of State for Foreign Affairs in the next administration speaking of Russian designs against India. He could only hope that Lord Curzon did not represent any large section of British public opinion. _ The idea of a Russian invasion of India was an utterly senseless one. Even if Russia were to acquire complete control of the future Trans-Persian Railway, it would be almost impossible for her to transport and maintain in a desert country, like that through which it would have to pass, a force sufficient for such a gigantic enterprise. I replied that the interpretation placed by his Excellency on Lord Curzon s speech was hardly a fair one. His Lordship had never attributed any aggressive designs to the Imperial Government. He represented a school, of which the military correspon dent of the “Times” had made himself the mouthpiece in the press, that advocated the maintenance of the isolation of India, on the ground that, as we did not possess an army on the scale of those of the Continental Powers, it was folly for us to encourage an enterprise that might render our Indian frontier more vulnerable. The attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Trans-Persian Railway had been throughout sympathetic, and they had looked on it with favour as opening up a fresh field for Anglo-Russian co-operation. It was not strategic considerations that had raised anv doubts in their minds as to the feasibility of the undertaking, but rather the financial difficulties with which its construction and exploitation were confronted. M. Sazonof admitted that he was himself not quite clear as to how the latter difficulties were to be surmounted, seeing that a Government guarantee by England and Russia was out of the question. He was, none the less, convinced thut the idea underlying the railway scheme was a great one, and that its realisation would be to the advantage of both Persia and India. In supporting it, Russia was giving a proof of her disinterestedness, as the introduction of the principle of internationalisation which the railway would carry with it would be a bar to the policy of aggrandisement with which she was credited by extreme Radicals in England. On the other band the Powers, who constructed and controlled the railway, would y | exercise an effective control over the Persian Government, and this would render abor tive any attempts that Germany might make in future to assert her influence at Tehran. It was inconceivable that Persia should place obstacles in the way of a railway that was / so manifestly to her advantage, but, until the question of the trace was settled, we could not possibly ask for the concession. He therefore trusted that the Societe d’Etudes would carry out their investigations and present their report with the least possible delay. His Excellency then enquired whether I could tell him how matters stood at present. I replied that I understood, from what M. Zvegintsof had told me, that the Russian Government had in years gone by, when the relations between the two countries were not as cordial as at present, caused surveys to be made of much of [2545/—21 St. Petersburgh, July 22, 1912. through St. Petersburgh yesterday Emperor will receive the King of me an interview in the course of the•i ilrl uass This fact would no doubt greatly the country through which the railway '™ uld P a * e necessary to send out engineers to expedite matters, though it might nevertheless be n ^ ^ wouU be nece8sary control the accuracy of these surveys.

The financial difficulties in the way of its realisation are so great, that even M. Sazonof realises that the Trans-Persian Railway may, after all, die a natural death. I would, therefore, venture to suggest that we should say not b ,„gto discourage the scheme at the present stage, as, should we eventually find that it is opp . to our interests, it will not be difficult for us to find some way of obstructing it indirectly when the financial side of the question comes up for discussion. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN.7 THE TRANS-PERSIAN RAILWAY. LORD CURZON’S REPLY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,—Just as I am leaving London I see that you have opened a rather belated fire upon a speech that I made in the House of Lords on July 15, more than three weeks ago, about the projected Trans-Persian Railway, accusing me of rhetorical exaggeration, and so forth. Your present opinions are not, so far as I know, shared by any of those who are best qualified by experience and authority to speak on the matter, other than the few able writers who have converted you to their views. Ever since we had an external frontier in India our policy has been to save India as far as possible from direct contact with foreign Powers. This has not been a policy of selfish, or foolish, or old-fashioned isolation, but has been dictated by the highest considerations of economy, prudence, and national security. Continental railways in the long run involve continental frontiers, continental complica tions, continental burdens. If passengers and mails can be carried by an international rail way to India, equally can soldiers and guns, and whatever the advantages, if any, it is not possible to contend that India will be as safe as before. What reason, I ask, is there for building (largely with British or Indian money) a line to India that will thus weaken the security of India, will do no good to Great Britain, and be of very doubtful advantage to British or Indian trade ? Any one who heard the debate in the House of Lords could see that Lord Morley and Lord Crewe disliked the idea almost as much as myself (and are therefore, I suppose, equally open to your disapproval), but that the Government have been compelled to lend a Platonic support to the investigation of the scheme by the threat that if they did not some other Powers would do it in spite of them. In my view this was a brutum fulmen ; but even supposing it to be otherwise, it does not provide a very sound or creditable reason for British co-operation. You say that after advising the Government to hesitate a hundred times before taking such a step I added, “ That was the opinion of India.” I neither said nor even hinted any thing of the sort. You have apparently taken these words from the exceedingly condensed report that appeared in The l imes of July 16. I neither spoke them, nor anything like them, as the Parliamentary report will show. As I said in a recent debate, it is impossible to speak in general terms of the opinion of India about anything, and I assuredly should not have been so foolish as to predicate it about a subject of which 999 out of every 1,000 of the Indian population must be profoundly ignorant. So far as I can judge from a perusal of the Indian Press, the majority of the English newspapers are suspicious or hostile, and the native newspapers, as a rule, entirely hostile. But the argument is one that I did not use then and refrain from using now. You express surprise that I doubt the advan tage to Persia of the proposed railway, and you actually quote, in support of your argument, some phrase that I once employed about the beneficence and unifying influence of rail ways in India. Do you really contend that there is any analogy between the two—between a country with 315 millions of people, a bountiful trade, and an ordered Government, and a country whose entire population is less than ten millions, which consists for the most part of deserts, interspersed with bare oases, and the Government of which is in a state of such hopeless collapse that it cannot even keep order on the few highways, and is in almost hourly danger of complete dissolution ? I can imagine railways which might do good, even now, to Persia, but they would not be on the alignment or with the objects of the Trans- Persian scheme. But surely the question ought to be asked. Do the Persian Government or the Persian nation want this railway, that, according to you, is to confer upon them such blessings ? Have they asked for it ? Are they behind the project ? As I write there is before me the letter of the Persian correspondent of the Near East, dated Teheran, July 4. This is what he says :—• The Trans-Persian Railway scheme is again the absorbing topic. With the exception of those who expect to benefit directly by the consummation of the proposals, the labours of the Socifitti d’Etudes excite but little enthusiasm amongst the native popula tion here, while there are many who regard the seiiioe with suspicion and consider it as another step in the direction of absorption. . . . The sanction of Persia will have to be obtained under pressure, for it is no exaggeration to say that the bulk of Persian opinion is opposed to it, whilst it is just as true to state that the most popular scheme here is that which will satisfy in large measure her present needs. If this be the attitude of Persia, why should we join in forcing upon her a railway that she does not want, and which she rightly thinks will rivet upon her the fetters of foreign domina tion — a il the more so that we have not even the selfish excuse of thinking that it will be of any benefit to ourselves ? Such a policy is to me inexplicable, and seems to rest upon no foundation either of expediency or statesman- Sh B P ut really what are the practical chances of the railway being made, at any rate in an early future ? You quote the Secretary of State for India as saying that not a rupee of Indian money is likely to be spent upon it. Do you imagine for a moment that Great Britain will find the money or give the guarantees ? And, if not, who is to do so ? Are we to contemplate a railway being made to India, through terri tories under our influence or protection, where not actually under our rule, by money raised on the Continent of Europe (for there is none in Persia) ? Would any British Government be found to acquiesce in such a solution ? For this reason, not least, I deprecate official encouragement being given to a project that appears to me certain not merely to do harm, if carried out, but to cause international friction and annoyance if, as seems to me more probable, it is foredoomed to failure. I am, Sir, yours faithfully, August 9. CURZON OF KEDLESTON. r# * we regret the inaccuracy to which Lord Curzon calls attention in the report of his speech. Such errors, however, are bound to occur, so long as the House of Lords persists in stationing the reporters in a place where it is impossible properly to hear the speeches.]India Office, 6th April 1911. Sir, /, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, marked confidential, of the 20th instant, regarding the proposed Trans-Persian Railway, and to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter, No. 18, Secret, dated 23rd February 1911, and enclosures, that has been received from the Government of India on the same subject. 2. The communication from the Russian promoters appears to add nothing to the information conveyed in Sir G. Buchanan’s Despatch No. 29 of 31st January last, except the fact that they seem to think themselves justified by the attitude of the Russian Government in proceeding with the scheme. That attitude is described by the Russian Government themselves as follows :— “ The council was generally favourable to the proposal brought forward by the promoters of the enterprise that a special commission (‘ societe d’etudes ’) should be instituted for a preliminary study of the question, on the understanding, however, that the realisation of the scheme shall not involve loss to the Russian Treasury or damage the economic interests of Russia. “ The decision of the Council of Ministers on this subject will take final shape as soon as the Ministries interested have arrived at an agreement.” And it has been added in conversation that the only financial support that the enterprise would receive from the Russian Government would be a certain share in any surplus profits that might accrue to the State railways from increased receipts due to the transit traffic in goods and passengers through Russia. Sir E. Grey expresses the hope that it may be possible for His Majesty’s Government to adopt an attitude towards the scheme not less favourable than that of the Russian Government. It will be seen from the Government of India’s letter and the papers enclosed therein that from the point of view of through traffic, whether of goods or passengers, a Trans-Persian railway such as that proposed is thought to have no prospects of financial success, and, further, that India can hope to derive from the development of local traffic no commercial advantage at all commensurate with that which Russia may expect. If this view is sound—-and I am to say that Viscount Morley concurs generally in it —the question arises Why should India sacrifice all the strategical advan tages of her geographical isolation in order to encourage a^ scheme which, whatever prospect of profit it may offer to her commercial rival, offers none to herself V , . 5; An indirect answer may perhaps be given to this question. It may be pointed out that with the advent of other Powers in Persia, seeking spheres of commercial if not of political expansion, the geographical isolation of India is necessarily doomed, and that it behoves those who are responsible lor her interests to be foremost in the race for concessions, so as to ensure that at least as may be strategically and politically essential to her security shall be in her own hands. One or more of these concessions would be for railway lines which, though their immediate purpose would^ be different, might, without disadvantage, form connecting links in a Trans-Persian railway. T , , b x Lord Morley thinks that this is, on the whole, a reasonable answer, tint certain corollaries appear to follow from it: (1.) Whatever the alignment of the rest of the line, it is essential that that part of it which will be in the British sphere shall be determined solely with a view to Indian interests. _ The line must therefore, m Lord Morley’s opinion, enter the British sphere at Bunder Abbas, and not at Kerman, and run along the coast to Karachi ; and there must be a break of gauge at Bunder Abbas. S. 62.it is essential that the actual construction and working of the section in the British sphere should be entirely in British hands; but Acre would be no objection to placing abroad contracts for a certain proportion of the materials and rolling stock. (d.) It is practically certain that British capitalists will not entertain the scheme unless there is a Government guarantee in some form or another. And this raises a very important and difficult question of principle. Before dealing with that I am to observe, on a point of detail, that the proposed Russian guarantee appears to be illusory It is true that in Sir E. Grey’s Despatch, No 78, to Sir G. Buchanan* dated 14th March, Count Benckendorff is reported to estimate the profit on increased traffic on Russian railways at 4,500,000 roubles (about 475,000L) a year. Lord Morley is unable to conjecture upon vdiat data this estimate is based ; but it is obvious that if the view taken above be correct, and the through traffic be not likely to pay, the mciease of traffic m Russia itself must be of modest dimensions; and, if the Government of India’s Committee are correct m thinking that the Consortium have enormously over estimated the gross earnings of the through line, the Russian Government’s “guarantee fund ” will manifestly be inadequate. But whatever view Russian financiers may take of it, British financiers are likely to require from their own Government some more substantial consideration. Lord Morley is not aware what are Sir E. Grey’s views upon this subject, but it will be seen that the Government of India recommend that any financial responsibility undertaken by Great Britain should- be equally shared between the Indian and British exchequers. This recommendation will call for serious consideration in view of the heavy expenditure already borne by India in providing for the defence of her frontiers. If those frontiers are made more vulnerable by a scheme of railway extension, wdiich Imperial policy and the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the European Powers force upon the acceptance of India, her claims upon the Imperial Exchequer will be strong. But at present the railway project is only under examination, and it is reasonable to defer a decision in regard to the guarantee until the conclusions of the experts have been received. Subject to these remarks his Lordship agrees with the Government of India, and would suggest that the assent of His Majesty’s Government should be given to the scheme in principle, and that application should be made for the concessions for blocking purposes, as soon as the situation in Persia permits. The project can then be examined in detail by an expert body similar to the Russian societe cVetudes. 1 am to add that Lord Morley is of opinion that it will not survive such an examination. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Sd.) R. Ritchie. 4’he Under Secretary of State, Eoreign Office.V'VW-S-'-'v) Cu^cj, THE TRANS-PERSIAN RAILWAY. A REPLY TO PROFESSOR VAMB&amp;RY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,—I was greatly surprised to read in your issue of the 20th inst. that Mr. Vamb&amp;ry finds it “ quite intelligible that the scheme of the Trans-Persian Railway enjoys a particular favour with the trading world of Russia.” Can it be that he is not aware that the Moscow merchants, in whose hands is most of all Russian trade, and the wdiole of that with Persia, are bitterly opposed to it ? Mr. Vambrty assures us “ they are doing all in their pow-er to forward it ” ; in reality they vehemently protested and sent petitions and deputations to the Ministers of Finance and of Commerce, demanding that they should not permit its construction. Mr. Vambdry pretends to know they have well “ discovered the material benefit accruing from that enterprise.” As a matter of fact, the memorial presented by the leading merchants of Russia to the Government describes the railway, on the contrary, as conducing to the ruin of the Russian trade with Persia, and points at the danger of English goods invading the Caucasus and all Eastern Russia. That determined opposition of the trading -world of Russia to the said scheme was reported in most English papers, and it was referred to in a speech by the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons. It is really a pity that, widely known and indisputable as the fact is, it wholly escaped Mr. Vambery’s atten tion when he undertook to enlighten the readers of The Times on that subject. In the same issue I read Colonel Yate’s letter on the same question, in which he states he considers the railway as “a scheme of Russian aggrandise ment,” and similar opinions were expressed in some other letters addressed to you. Having passed a whole month in Russia this summer I had many opportunities of talking to people of different parties and occupations on all questions connected with Anglo-Russian relations, among them of the Trans- Persian Railway. So far from meeting any one favouring it from political ambition, I met but few who favoured it unconditionally, and many who were greatly opposed to it. The St. Petersburg I Press was divided concerning it ; the Moscow Press almost unanimously hostile. I quoted above the commercial objections ; as for political ones, it would suffice to take a British opponent’s letter and to put in it “ Russia ” instead of “ Great Britain ” and “ the Caucasus ” for “ India ” to learn to know very nearly what the Russian opponents mean. Even the supporters of the line do not deny the harm it will do to the Russian trade in Persia ; they only think that, after consenting to the building of the connecting link with the Baghdad Railway, which is sure to open the way to German goods, there would be no sense in trying to prevent the introduction of English ones. There is, of course, a group of capi talists in Russia who consider the railway a good business and are ready to risk money on preliminary investigation; but they are not more enthusiastic about it than are the French and British capitalists who also are prepared to spend money on such an investigation. The scheme, consequently, is a private scheme, and not more Russian -than it is French or British. I have even, heard stronger arguments in its favour in Paris and in London than in St. Petersburg, not to speak of Moscow. Personally, I have not yet been able to form a definitive opinion whether the obvious disadvantages of that railway for Russia would find adequate com pensations. I am therefore entirely adhering to the wise conclusion of a leading article of The Times, that it ought to be investigated thoroughly and without prejudice.

Societe Internationale d'Etudes du Chemin de Fer Transpersan. I have the honour to inform you that the Societe Internationale d'Etudes du Chemin de Fer Transpersan was definitely constituted at the second Assembles Generals Constitutive held in Paris on June 12th. The Statutes of this Society as well as the Pro tocols and its two Annexes have already been communicat ed to the Foreign Office, to which Department the names of the British, Russian and French members of the Con- seil d'Administration are already known. The first meeting of this Conseil d'Administration took place in Paris on June 14th, when the preliminary measures necessary for inaugurating the business of the Societe were duly taken. Fully conscious of the magnitude and importance of British and British Indian interests Louis Mallet, K.C.M.G., &amp;c. Foreign Office. involved in the pro jectproject of a xranS'-Fersian Railway, for the study of which enterprise the present Societe has been formed, the British members duly communicated to the Societe a copy of the enclosed memorandum for the information of their Russian and French associates. At the meeting of the Comite de Direction held in Paris on June 15th, measures were discussed for the advancement of the Societe’s objects in this country and in Russia, with the result that notes were drawn up on behalf of the Societe for the guidance of its members in Great Britain and Russia. Copies of these notes I now beg to enclose herewith. After further deliberations the British participants in this project will have the honour of continuing this correspondence. I have &amp;c., (Signed) W.E. Garstin. Vice-President.Memorandum. f f Communicated officially dy British Croup to the Conseil d f Administration of:- Societe Internationale d'Etudes du Chemin de Fer Transpersan. The extent to which the British Group will he able usefully to co-operate in the proceedings of the Bociete d’Etudes will in so large a measure depend upon the support forthcoming from the British and Indian Governments that it Is considered essential at the out set to designate clearly the conditions imposed by the British Government Authorities in supporting British participation. The British Group wish, therefore, to place before their French and Russian Associates a statement of the points upon which the British Government desire to be consulted in regard to the subsidiary companies to be formed in the future by the Bociete d’Etudes for carry ing out its purposes. These points are the following a. Constitution of Board or Boards. b. The representation of British and British Indian interests. c.c. The alignment. ** ■ c. ,o I d. The gauge or gauges — e. ihe percentage of construction orders to he placed on the British market. f. The freight and passenger rates. The above points are also necessarily of interest to the Governments of the other two participating groups, but the British Group feel it incumbent upon them clearly to define their position in order more easily and advantageously to contribute to the advance ment of the scheme which the Societe, as a whole, hope to bring to a successful conclusion. 14th June, 1912.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No - ■OWi/A- and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. ^ V, . j ! £ i 2 1 The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop v of the under-mentioned paper.

The Marquess of SALISBURY : I have to apologise to your Lordships for not being in my place on Wednesday last when this Bill was under discussion, on which occasion a number of Govern ment Amendments were inserted in the Bill on Report with a view to the Bill being reprinted and re-committed. The efiect of the Government Amendments then inserted was in some respect? to diminish the stringency of the Bill and in other respects to increase it. The principal form in which diminution has taken place under those Amendments is that the absolute prohibition of underground work places in the future, as the provision stood in the original draft of the Bill, is done away with. A broad distinction was made on the face of the Bill itself between existing workplaces and those started after the commencement of the Act. In regard to existing workplaces, what we originally proposed was that they should be subject to stringent regulations, but that any workplace hereafter established should not be permitted at all if it was underground within the meaning of the Statute. Having made this short statement I will, without further preface, move that the House resolve itself into Committee on the Bill. Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee .—{The Marquess of Salisbury.) On Question, Motion agreed to. House in Committee accordingly.445 Factory and Workshop [The Earl of Donoughmore in Chair.] Clause 1: • [LORDS] {No. 2) Bill. 446 the of the Bill as to the scope the local authori ties are intended to take in administering it. I do not know whether the noble Lord who represents the Home Office has had time to consider this point. Underground Premises. 1 _(i) On and after the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and fourteen, or such later date, not being later than the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and fifteen, as the Secretary of State may by order appoint, no underground room in a factory, workshop, or workplace shall be used for the purpose of any of the processes or occupations specified in the Schedule to this Act unless duly certified by the district council to be suitable for the process or occupation named m the certificate, and unless the regulations made under this Act or the conditions contained in the certificate are complied with. _ (2) For the purposes of this Act an underground room shall mean any room any part of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. The Marquess of SALISBURY : The first question I wish to raise on Clause 1 is that of the meaning of the word “ work place.” There is no definition of “ work place ” in the Bill, and what I venture to submit to the Government is that they would be well advised in agreeing to some definition. I know that there is great difficulty in the matter, and therefore I have not put an Amendment on the Paper dealing with this point, but I shall be ready to do so at the next stage. It is true that the word “ workplace ” has already received Judicial interpretation, and that that interpretation is of a very wide character ; but we have to think not merely of the legal effect of the words in the Bill but of the indication which its pro visions will constitute to the local authorities who have to carry it out. The local authorities who will primarily have to carry out the provisions of this Bill are the district councils, and if they are presented with a Bill dealing in rather a drastic way for the first time with work places of a certain character and are not told what a workplace means, they may feel rather bewildered, and may take what, after all, is the easiest refuge for a be wildered local authority—namely, do nothing at all. That is the most likely issue of any doubt on their part as to what “ workplace ” means. Therefore as we are all anxious, and I am sure the Govern ment are, to make this Bill efiective, it is necessary that some definition of “ workplace ” should be inserted, so that there should be an indication on the face The PAYMASTER-GENERAL (Lord Strachie) : As the noble Marquess is aware, there is a great deal of difficulty in regard to this question. The danger isfl that you may either be too elastic in your definition or too limited and too narrow, and you may raise difficulties in that way. At present there is no definition of “ work place ” in the Factories Acte Parhament so far has not thought fit to frame any definition of the word, although it has been in use in Public Health/Acts for something like thirty years, firing which period there has been ohly one case brought before the Courts -for an interpretation of the word “ workplace.” The point in that case was whether or not a cabyard was a workplace, and the learned Judge held that in that particular case the cabyard was a workplace, but he refused to give any precise definition of what a workplace was. If the noble Marquess, between now and the Report stage of the Bill, can make any suggestion on the point—and it must be remembered that any definition inserted in this Bill would have to be read with the existing Factories Acts—the Home Office will be r^ady to consider it. But 1 would urge him, seeing that this legisla tion has worked so well during the last thirty years, whether it is not wise to leave well alone in this particular case. The Marquess of SALISBURY : I will not press the matter further at this moment, but I should be glad of a conversation with the noble Lord upon it. The first Amend ment standing in my name on the Paper is to Clause 1, and it deals with the definition of what constitutes, if I may coin a word, “ undergroundness.” As the Bill stands, it says that an underground room shall mean any room any part of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than 3 feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street or of the ground adjoining or nearest the room. That, in fact, does not make a room under ground, and it clearly cannot be said to be such a distinction as to justify putting such a workroom under the drastic pro visions of this Statute. I venture to think we shall make a great mistake if we pass JF' . if tW' cfli®?! 5 ’ g. 9 „T 100® aB ‘ P‘, sb$ 0, J flip to®* ^ -csd from jtfliie® if ^ Loed SD kt moved. ie Am®fo lylflti® c ilvastt- m fans this present'lac ■ fcqwssth -ioufil jTjronaon 1 am (jmtf mest.

What is important is not where the floor of the room is but where the ceiling is. If the ceiling is nearly on a level with the ground outside, then, indeed, the room is underground ; but the position of the floor is of much less importance. In the words which I have ventured to place on-the Paper I have endeavoured to strike I a compromise by providing that it should | depend neither upon the floor nor the ceiling, but that the definition should be that ^an underground room shall mean any room any part of which is so situate that half or more than half the whole height thereof measuring from the floor to the ceiling is below the surface. Amendment moved— Clause 1, page Inline 17, leave out (“ the surface of the floor is more than three feet ”) and insert (“ half or more than half the whole height thereof measured from the flooYto the ceiling is”).—{The Marquess of Salisbury.) % m. Lord STRACHIE: In accepting the Amendment which the noble Marquess has just moved, I should like to point out that the Amendment which was inserted on my Motion on Report last week, before the Bill was re-committed, was put in so as to bring this Bill into conformity with the present Factories Acts. But if the noble Marquess thinks the provision too stringent though I do not think it is as stringent a provision as the one in the original Bill I am quite ready to accept the Amend ment. On Question, Amendment agreed to. Clause 1, as amended, agreed to. iy part oft:: urface of tie k nearest Shi Clause 2 : Certification. m as to pf ite. ■ eat 2. An underground room shall not he certified by the district council as suitable unless the council are satisfied that such underground room complies with the regulations made under this Act: Provided that if no regulations applicable to the case have been so made a certificate shall not be granted unless the district council are satisfied that the room is suitable in respect of the matters as to which regulations might have been made, and the certificate shall specify the means required, as a condition of certification, to be provided for securing the health of the persons employed in the room, and shall be made conditional on such means being maintained and properly used. The Marquess op SALISBURY: On the Question that Clause 2 stand part of the Bill I wish to lay a point before the Govern ment. In the Amendments which they inserted on the last stage of the Bill they provided that in cases where there are no regulations under the Bill the district council shall act without regulations. That appears to me, if I may say so, an almost indefensible proposition. This Bill provides that in certain circumstances an under ground workplace is to be suppressed. If such a step is necessary, it is very proper that it should be taken, but Parliament has always been very jealous that this shall only be done with every precaution. Conse quently in I think almost all Statutes of this kind there is the ordinary rules clause, containing certain provisions for regulations which govern the operation of the Act, and this Bill, like other Bills, has the rules clause. Those regulations are to be made under the authority of the Home Office, and it seems astonishing that if Parliament should think it right to give the Home Office power to make regulations Parliament should also say that if the Home Office do not make regulations district councils may act without regulations. I am afraid that cannot be defended. Under the rules clause every conceivable precaution is taken that injustice is not done. There has to be an advertisement in the local newspaper, and there has to be an inquiry if it is called for by any persons who think they have a right to object. The regulations them selves have to lie on the Tables of both Houses of Parliament so that they may, if necessary, be objected to. All these pre cautions are taken in the case of regulations which are made by the Home Office. But if a district council is to act alone, none of these precautions are to have effect. If the Home Office makes regulations they are to be made with the greatest precaution, but if the Home Office makes no regulations then this drastic Statute is to operate on the fiat of the district council alone. I know that there is an appeal to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction, but that is not an exalted authority to which to entrust the rights and privileges of His Majesty s subjects in a Statute of this kind. If we attempt to go in front of public opinion to that extent we shall defeat our object, and the result will be that the Bill will not get through both Houses of Parliament. What we should say is that underground rooms are un wholesome and insanitary if they do not comply with certain regulations ; that those449 Factory and Workshop regulations should be made by the Home Office; and that the Bill should not operate until the Home Office makes the regulations That is the right course, and 1 urge His Majesty’s Government to consider the point before the next stage of the Bill is taken. {No. 2) Bill Lord BTRACHIE : With a good deal of what the noble Marquess has said i agree, but I would point out some of the difficulties. It would be perfectly impossi ble for the Home Office straight off to make regulations dealing with every one of the various trades which have been included m the schedule of this Bill. [LORDS] Benches carry out their duties with the greatest care, the greatest circumspection, and the greatest fairness, and I cannot see anything wrong in the provisions of Clause 2 in regard to this matter. But I will see that the point is carefully con sidered and will bring the remarks of the noble Marquess before the Home Secretary between now and the Report stage. The Marquess of SALISBRUY have till 1914. They Lord STRACHIE ; It might take many years to do this. The Marquess of SALISBURY : Oh ! Lord STRACHIE : Well, that is the opinion held at the Home Office. I would remind the noble Marquess, as regards some of the various classes which he desires to include in the schedule, that at the present moment there is no power for Home Office inspectors to deal with these classes. Foi instance, as regards typewriting offices and restaurant kitchens there is no power of inspection by the Home Office. The only people who have that power are the officers, of the local authorities. Perhaps between now and the Report Stage the noble Marquess can bring forward suggestions which may make it possible for the Home Office to undertake this work. I must say I was rather surprised at the fear shown by the noble Marquess of local authorities. I have served upon every kind of local authority, and I certainly have no dread that local authorities are going to be too active in this matter. I think the pro moters of the Bill would rather have to fear that the local authorities would not be sufficiently active. If local authorities are too active, all they do is done in sight of the electors who return them, and where any injustice is likely to be done there will be a good opportunity of correcting those people who go in' front of public opinion. For myself I have not the slightest fear that local authorities are likely to be too active or unfair or Unjust in this matter. The noble Marquees not only appears nervous of local authorities but he also seems to think that there is not much faith to be put in Courts of Summary Jurisdiction. These The Marquess of Salisbury. The Marquess of SALISBURY : I anm obliged to the noble Lord, and after his promise I will not press the matter. It is not that I distrust local authorities, but I think the Home Office ought to see that regulations are made in each case. I am not afraid that the local authorities will be too active in the matter, but rather that the interests which are involved will take care, unless there is an amendment in this direction, that the Bill will not pass into law. Lord STRACHIE : It is difficult for the Home Office to make regulations in regard to places where we have no power to send our inspectors. Th^ Marquess of SALISBURY : I was not aware that the Home Office had no powers of inspection in the two cases referred to by the noble Lord. I will qbnsider that point before the next stage. Clause 2 agreed to. Clauses 3 to 7 agreed to. Clause 8 : Regulations. 8 — (1) The Secretary of State may by Order mines n®* otter is 1 over, t^ 1 te prevent* make regulations as to structure of underground rooms to which this Act applies, and the provision and use as regards such rooms of means for secur ing the maintenance of reasonable temperature, proper lighting and ventilation, freedom from damp, dust, effluvia, and exhalations, and the carrying off of dust and fumes, and otherwise for securing the health of persons employed in under ground rooms in the processes and occupations to which this Act applies; and different regulations may be made as respects different processes and different occupations, or as respects rooms which are used for the purposes of any of such processes or occupations at the time when the Order comes into effect, and rooms which are not so used. (2) The Secretary of State may by order extend the provisions of this Act to processes and occupa tions other than those specified in the Schedule to this Act, and thereupon this Act shall, subject to the provisions of the Order, apply as if that schedule included the processes and occupations specified in the order. (3) Sections eighty, eighty-one, and eighty-four of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (relating to the procedure for making regulations as to dangerous trades), shall apply to the making of orders under this section.

The Marquess of SALISBURY: On this clause I should like to represent one k ^ matter to the noble Lord who speaks for the lug 3 Home Office. The regulations are per- t is 3 fectly elastic ; they may be good or they tile may be bad—we trust the Home Office for that—but there is one particular about tepo tu ^ which I think there can be no doubt, and that is the question of artificial light. I do ^%'&gt;ot think it is possible to defend a system HaiilV under Which workpeople have to work 58 % matte always under artificial light. I am confident a Wliorit| that the whole public opinion of this ^iitw country is against such a thing. There i eacW. ought to be natural ventilation and natural alautkW light. The former it is somewhat difficult WhW to define, but natural light is perfectly 'e involve possible to define.

He has already said that some people might say that by so stringent a regulation you would shut up mines and underground railways which are lighted by artificial light. ‘The noble Marquess said that neither of these was in the schedule, but he must not forget that the Home Office has power indefinitely to extend the schedule. I think we ought very carefully to consider whether it is desirable to do this. The noble Marquess must also remember that it might be held that basements in London houses come under the Bill, and we are all aware that there are many houses in London where work is carried on in basements which are lighted by artificial light, if not during the whole of the day, at any rate during nearly the whole of the day. I am doubtful, if artificial light is of a proper kind and properly shaded and if there is proper ventilation, whether a great many trades annot be carried on perfectly well, just as coal-mining is carried on, in artificial light—that is to say, if other conditions are satisfactory; but we are quite ready at the Home Office to consider this question between now and the Report stage. I urge upon the noble Marquess, however, that it is important to see that the pro vision does not interfere unduly with any trade which may be carried on perfectly well under artificial light. The Marquess of SALISBURY : I am obliged to the noble Lord. Clause 8 agreed to. Remaining Clauses agreed to.

We have typewriting included, but not other clerical work.453 Factory and Workshop {No. 2) Bill .[ LORDS ] The Trans-Persian Kailway. 454 omission. It is I think that is a great true that you cannot apply to clerical work all the conditions that you apply to other trades in the schedule, but the Home Office have reserved to themselves^ com plete power to vary the regulations ac cording to the difference of occupations to which the regulations are to. apply. It would be perfectly possible for them, therefore, when dealing with other clerical work to apply only regulations which were applicable to that work. When you consider that the object of thip Bill is as far as possible to prevent underground work, it is a serious omission to leave untouched the great branch of clerical work. The health of clerks, both male and female, is as much entitled to pro tection by Act of Parliament as the health of typists and those engaged in the other trades mentioned. I therefore think the Government would be well advised, between now and the next stage, to consider whether j it would not be possible to add the words | “ and other clerical work.” Lord STRACHIEI am afraid I cannot give the noble Marquess any hope I that the Government Will do this. It seems | to me that he is opening a very large area i indeed and making a very serious addition to the schedule. I should like to warn him that there is great danger in adding other clerical work. You would have to increase, not only the number of inspectors working under the Home Office, but you would certainly have to increase those under local authorities. I am sure none of us are anxious to increase the number of inspectors. In fact, I have been rather shocked to-day at the light way in which the noble Marquess has been ready to increase the number of inspectors and add to the cost not only upon the taxes but upon the local rates. I always thought that the principal charge against His Majesty’s Government was that they were setting up too many officials, but here the Home Office is being urged to further extend this Bill and set up additional officials.

THE TRANS-PERSIAN RAILWAY *Earl WTO'ffi 'HULM'Ur^ to call attention to the project of a Trans- Persian Railway; to inquire as to the policy of His Majesty’s Government and the views of the Government of India in relation to this proposal ; and to move for Papers. I'KJ The noble Earl said: My Lords, I propose to confine myself very strictly tS ^ the terms of the Notice on the Paper. Though the question of Persian railways does touch the general position in Persia, and though the customary latitude of debate in our House would allow me, I imagine, to raise that question, I propose to resist the temptation altogether this evening. Neither shall I say anything about the cognate question of the Baghdad Railway except this, that it seems to me that, if we are going in for a Trans-Persian line, such a line must react unfavourably on the prospects of the Baghdad Railway; for this reason, that if by this railway you place your passengers or your goods at the Indian end of the Arabian Sea, ob viously there is less inducement either for passengers or for goods to take advantage of a railway which will deposit them at the other or Turkish end of the Persian Gulf. My first point is this. I doubt whether your Lordships realise the extraordinary and almost unsuspected rapidity with which this question is moving. I wonder whether Parliament, and, still more, the public, has any idea what is going on and what has already been done. This is not a question of an ordinary line being built in a foreign country, -whether for the f ^ 1 development of communications, the con nection of cities, or the advancement of trade. This is a question of a great trunk line running all the way through Asia to India, necessarily altering the whole position in India itself and the future security of our rule in that country, and compelling us—this will be part of my argument—to revise the principles upon which the defence of India has so far been based. How many are there, even of the public who follow the affairs of Asia, who realise that such a line as I speak of is now being surveyed, that a sum of nearly £ 100,000 has been subscribed by financiers in this country and in Russia and in France for carrying out these preliminary pro ceedings, and, what is more important, that His Majesty’s Government have agreed “ in principle ’’—these are their tee!#- As iiaJ saying i £ -KjlytoaQ lilnate state. ol rapid il«ed beta t all 1 can rot, is that hoate condit let me state sue, and, of ile to coin itieh is at re are as His llaje W the Si tae nations Sma-toSts 455 The Trans-Persian Railway.

A year ago nobody would have dreamt that such a° thing would be possible, and the witness that I call is the noble Viscount (Lord Morley) who sits opposite me, and who, I believe, is to follow me this evening. He will recall that we had a debate here in March, 1911, upon the question of Persia, the Baghdad Railway, and other cognate subjects. In the course of that debate I asked him whether the idea of a Irans- Persian railway was seriously entertained by the Government and whether it occupied any place in the field of international politics, and the noble Viscount replied to me as follows— «Any ideas or designs on that subject are far too immature for any sensible, or useful, or in structive observations to be made upon them. The noble Viscount added that he himself was inclined to share my doubts as to the workableness of the particular design to which I had referred. These observations were, I think, calculated to lull any sus picions that might have been entertained by any of us as to this project. The same efiect was produced by the answers of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons up till quite a recent date. As recently as May 14 he was found saying in the House of Commons, in reply to a Question, that matters with regard to this railway were still in a very inchoate state. I do not know the precise degree of rapidity with which they have advanced between May 14 and to-day, but all I can say, if my information is correct, is that they are not at all in an inchoate condition now. Let me state the facts as they are known to me, and, of course, if I am wrong I am liable to correction at the hands of the noble Viscount opposite, who has access to information much superior to that which is at my disposal. I believe the facts are as follow. There has been founded, with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty’s Government, a body called the Societe d’Etudes. This is an international body composed of financiers, politicians, and engineers drawn from the three nations—Great Britain, France, and Russia—to which I referred. At the head of this body is a council of adminis tration consisting of twenty-four gentlemen, e ii$ 1912 ] The Trans-Persian Bailway. 456 eight drawn from each of the three nations, the British representatives upon which were appointed with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty’s Government. There is to be a committee of directors of twelve chosen by the larger body. And this society has, I think, already begun to meet in Paris. Their functions are, broadly speaking, these. Their business is to conduct the surveys for the railway, to obtain the requisite concession from the Persian Government, and to submit to the Governments concerned definite esti mates and plans. I believe that to be a correct account of what their functions are. For the preliminary purposes that I have described a sum of £90,000 has been raised by these three financial groups, and I think we may rest assured that this money would not have been found unless there was some substantial belief that the Government were behind the undertaking. Now', my Lords, let me state in a few words what the scheme, so far as I under stand it, is. This great Trans-Persian railway is to start from Baku, the Russian port on the western shore of the Caspian Sea ; or rather the railway, in so far as it is a Persian line, will start from Astara, but will be connected by rail with lire Russian port. From there it is to run via Resht and Kazvin to the capital, Teheran, and onwards to the old capital Isfahan. From that point there would appear to be some difference of opinion as to the alignment. One idea has been to take the railway down by the town of Yezd to Bundar Abbas on the Persian Gulf, but I believe that that idea is not now favourably enter tained. The other idea is to take the railway more to the East, through Kerman down either to the Persian port of Charbar on the shores of the Gulf, or, more easier y still, either to Gwattar or to Gwadar, which are ports in British Makran and therefore in Indian territory. The total length of this line is estimated by the promoters at 1 800 miles, but knowing the country fairly well through which it will go and remembering that you start at the sea on one side and end at the sea on the other, and that in the interval you have to climb at least 6,000 feet to cross the passes m certain sections of the Persian plateau, 1 venture to say the line will be nearer 2,500 miles in length than 2,000. The cost haS’ been estimated at from £ 15,000 000 to £ 20 , 000,000 ; but I have no doubt that trie actual cost, if the railway is ever constructed.457 T , rrORDSI The Trans-Persian Railway The Trans-Persian Railway. J will be much nearer £30,000,000 • It is said that this railway will reduce the journey from England to India from twelve and a-half to seven or eight days. Such, my Lords, as far as I can give it, is a brief outline of the scheme of which I am asking your Lordships to discuss the political, strategical, and commercial aspects to-day. I think there have been evidences of Government sympathy beyond those to which I have already referred. I ^ink 1 am right in saying that the British and Russian Ministers have been m consulta tion at Teheran with the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs in order to procure an option for the survey, and, later on the construction of the line. The n , ia . Government have deputed one of their Engineer officers, no doubt with the knowledge and approval of the Government at home, to examine the country lying to the west of Karachi, between Karachi and the eastern border of Persia, and I have seen it stated, apparently on good authority, m The Times newspaper that the Russian promoters have agreed—I call the House to notice the words “ Russian promoters, because they indicate the source from wme the active inspiration for the railway comes —that the Russian promoters have agreed to an equal participation at a later stage of the three countries concerned in the finance o the scheme. If I have been incorrect m an}-' of my particulars no doubt the noble Viscount will put me right when he speaks later on. Now we come to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. Fortunately, since I put down my Notice on the Paper this has been defined in circumstances of some precision by the Secretary of State, Sir Edward Grey, in the other House of Parlia ment, and I will ask your Lordships’ leave to read what he said on the matter. These are his words- “ His Majesty’s Government do not in principle oppose the Trans-Persian railway, and should under proper conditions be favourable to the principle.” He went on to say that His Majesty’s Government must reserve to themselves full freedom of action with regard to certain points—namely, the alignment of the railway, the constitution of the board, the representation of British interests upon it, freight, passenger rates, and in regard to the break of gauge. Further, the Foreign Secretary said— Earl Curzon of Kedleston. ment with Russia with regard to the branch lines to be made, with regard to the retention and control of lines in the British spheres, and with regard to equality of treatment for British trade.” The question of guarantees had been raised in the House of Commons, and the Foreign Secretary agreed that no guarantees should be given without the consent of Parliament. Finally, Sir Edward Grey said that he would I at a later date lay the report of the Societal ciL fct ictucx. r d’Etudes before the House, and that the Government would state to the House under what conditions they were prepared to con sent to any definite scheme before the country was absolutely committed. All these are sound and valuable assurances. I do not thank the Foreign Secretary for having given them, because in the circum stances of the case they were inevitable and indispensable. He might have given more; no Foreign Minister could possibly have given less. “ Before it receives support from His Majesty’s Government we should have to come to an agree- The question I have to ask is, Do these assurances go far enough ? I cannot help thinking—and I should be only too pleased to be disabused of the belief if it is wrong— that when the Government have encouraged, as they have done, the group of British financiers ; when they have interested themselves, as I believe they have, in the appointment of members of the council; when they have set their diplomatic machinery working in the interests of the scheme; and when, lastly, they have declared their sympathy with it in principle when they have done this I cannot help thinking that they have gone a long way in the direction of support of this proposal. Their attitude seems to me to be more than an attitude of benevolent neutrality and to be really an attitude of implied support if not of positive encouragement of the scheme. So much so that I can quite believe that it may be a matter of rather serious difficulty for them to retreat at a later date, and if they come with definite proposals before the House of Commons it may be a matter of difficulty for their supporters in that House not to see them through in this affair. It may even be a matter of difficulty for the country, not fully informed upon the case, not to support the Government in the line that, according to my hypothesis, it may have taken. And thus, my Lords, it may be that, starting from these inchoate proceedings to which I referred just now we may end by finding that we are more or less committed to a measure of which I will only at this moment Intlesecuci \oobtta* iepi atm# o oioimds, Sir E' ifkicl 1 referr tee observe Mobility, piirate opini av that soi meotion v a? that it v it twenty yi teplitasir aot Mow t i stow 1460 459 The Trans-Persian Railway. [15 July 1912 ] The Trans-Persian Railway. Olt Oi if; ometokii say this, that whether it be right or whether it be wrong it involves a more fundamental change in British policy towards India and the defence of India than any event that has taken place in the history of India since the days of Lord Clive. In these circumstances I think your Lord- ships will agree that it behoves this House \) look rather seriously into the grounds for this great departure, and to inquire what is the attitude of those who are really best qualified to advise about it. As regards the grounds, Sir Edward Grey, in the speech to which I referred, only found time for one, and that was the argument of inevitability. He said this railway must come ; it is sure to be made sooner or later, and therefore we had better join. I should like to make these observations upon the argument of inevitability. If I were asked for my private opinion, I think I would truthfully say that some day or other the overland connection with India will come. I do not say that it will come now or in ten years or (I'Kiu. - n twenty years, but I think some day it M will come. But because you may look upon ' m ■ it from that point of view, because you may ^ ® regard it as inevitable to that extent, it does eme f; not follow that the railway ought to be made now. It does not follow that because aylave®-. - a y nev ^ a | 3 i e to that extent it will be good ay k f or us or good for India. It does not follow toceedif ® that because it is inevitable we ought to take an active part in joining at the present 1 ® cal® gtage. i n fact, it does not follow in the least that because it is some day certain to be made this Government or any British Government ought to be favourable to the scheme. There are, for instance, other w T ays to approach India overland which have met with favour in some quarters. The shortest overland route to India is through the Russian territories of Trans- Caspia and through Afghanistan. I think that less than 500 miles intervene which are not now covered by rails. There are many people who think that that is the line by which Europe ought to be united to Asia. The arguments for that line are just as strong or just as weak, whichever way you like to put it, as those for the Trans- Persian line. The argument of inevitability applies equally to that line with the other. Yet no British Government has brought forward a concrete proposal for such a line, because we know that the Ameer of Afghan istan, as was his predecessor, is inflexiojy opposed to it. There is another scheme— that of running a railway from Egypt via Port Said across the Peninsula of Sinai and then across Arabia to the Persian Gulf. I make this observation to show that there is nothing in the argument of inevitability, for what it is worth, which applies particularly to the Trans-Persian scheme. Upon this question of inevitability may I recall to your Lordships a memory which is probably fairly fresh in the minds of many of you—I mean the construction of the Channel Tunnel. How easily it used to be shown in the House of Commons that the Channel is an artificial and superannuated obstacle which ought not to be allowed to continue, in so far as the action of man could counteract it, in view' of the wider and more cosmopolitan ideas of modern days. When first I entered the House of Commons I was rather affected by those view's myself, and I fancy I gave a foolish vote in favour of the con struction of the Channel Tunnel. But as soon as the military authorities had been heard on the matter, and when they demonstrated, as they did, that the Channel Tunnel would make England not safe, that it really would amount to a sacrifice of the incomparable frontier presented to us by nature, and that this little tube running under the sea, instead of merely being an instrument of amity and of commerce, might become an engine of invasion and destruction, from that moment public opinion changed and the Channel Tunnel scheme was overwhelmed with complete annihilation, an annihilation from w'hich our friendly regard for France was not able to rescue it. And yet precisely the same reasoning w 7 as used about the inevitability of the Channel Tunnel. Therefore I am not impressed in the least degree by that argument. I venture to say that the decision of a great issue of this sort ought not to be made on a prion grounds, nor on the fatalistic principle of accepting what will one day come. The sole test is whether the rail way will be for the advantage of England, India, and Persia. Is this railway wanted for any of those three parties ? Will it do good to any of them ? Will it materially improve their security, their peace, their prosperitv ? If so, let us go ahead with the railway. “ If not, let us desist. If you look at the matter from this point of view I think you cannot fail to be impressed by the attitude so far taken up by those who mav fairly be called experts on the matter. I have only myself met one man w'ho can461 The Trans-Persian Railway. [LORDS] The Trans-Persian Railway. properly claim that title with regard to this question who is in favour of the Trans- Persian scheme. In the debate in the House of Commons last week not a single speaker on either side of the House gave it anything like a whole-hearted support. In fact, I think every speaker who alluded to it was against it. There are some newspapers which ordinarily support His Majesty’s Government with unswerving fidelity—for instance, the Manchester Guardian —which are strenuously hostile to this proposal, on the perfectly worthy ground that it conflicts with all the ideas they have always entertained as to the principles of Indian frontier defence. Then we come to the military authorities. I can only speak for those whom I have come across, but among them there has not been a dissentient voice ; and I dare say your Lordships may have noticed that there have been during the past few days two letters in The Times by a military authority who certainly speaks with great ability and with great weight and to whom' His Majesty’s Government are indebted for many kind acts of written support—I mean the Military Correspondent of The Times. Colonel Repington. Last week he had a letter in The Times of which I will only read one paragraph, because it really contains the objections entertained by many people to this railway in a very convincing way— My opinion is that this scheme, if carried out will gravely alter the conditions under which India must he defended; will enable external pressure to be applied to India and will therefore be politically unacceptable; will not materially benefit Persia nor British and Indian interests in ersia, except by affording a quicker route for mai s , will divert mails and some passengers from the sea to the land route through Germany and will correspondingly injure our maritime carrying tiade and industries ; will reduce the profits which the pubhc derives from the Suez Canal; will pro- bably burden the finances of England or India or both ; and, while being of no conceivable fnilitary service to us m any circumstances that can be toreseen may in certain contingencies aggravate the military risks of India, increase the front which the Army in India has to defend with relatively weak forces, inflate expenditure upon defence, and render India more liable to foreign aggression fronS” °® ' ,er ° f ‘ h8 Shid&lt;i 3 ° S' That argument has been reinforced by tbe same writer in another and longer etter which many of your Lordships may have read in The Times of this mornino- • and I must say this, that to the criticisms to which I am referring no answer whatever &lt; has yet been given either by Sir Edward Earl Curzon of Kedleston, 462 Grey in the House of Commons or by any other spokesman of His Majesty’s Govern ment. You will expect me, perhaps, to examine a little more closely these various points— namely, the manner in which this railway, if built, will affect the security of India, will affect our communication with India, will affect Anglo-Indian trade with Persia. | and will affect the security of Persia itself. First let me take the defence of India. I imagine that it would be true to say that the history of the frontier defences of India during the last hundred years has, broadly speaking, pa ssed through twophases. First there was the time in which the Government of India were spreading their conquests over the level plains of India until they came up to the mighty barrier of the mountains, which stand like an artificial palisade around our borders. Sometimes, of course, as in the case of the first Afghan War, we were tempted to cross that barrier, but usually to our detriment. Then came the period, beginning about fifty years ago, when either because of the depredations of the tribes in the mountains or the existence of hostile and intriguing influences beyond we were driven forward in search of what used to be called a “ scientific frontier.” The consequences of those forward movements pursued over a wide circumference were these. In parts we took completely into our own hands the country beyond the palisade ; such was the case with Balu chistan ; elsewhere we put the mountain passes in charge of Militia levies, or military police raised from the tribes themselves, and we gave subsidies to the tribes; and as regards the countries beyond we con trived, by treaties or other arrangements, to protect or guarantee or neutralise the whole of the surrounding kingdoms to which I refer. Such was the case with regard to Persia, to Afghanistan, to Tibet, and, more in the East, Siam. But the whole point throughout in both these phases has been this, that India ought to be surrounded for the purpose of safety by a belt, be it of mountains or be it of desert, which it would be difficult to cross. You really may compare the position to that of a fortress with a great glacis stretch ing around it, cleared by the treaties and political arrangements which have been made, and swept by our guns. The theory has always been that no one should be at liberty to advance across that glacis'SlU |j:[ , 463 The Trans-Persian Railway.

Rightly or wrongly, I believe that has been the accepted policy of British ^ Governments and Governments of India for the best part of 100 years. To support that policy we have fought wars, we have indulged in great expenditure of men and money, and on one occasion in 1885 Mr. Glad stone almost went to war with Russia. This has hitherto been the accepted policy of both political Parties in this country. There has been very little difference on broad ground of principle between us. I do not say that this policy has saved’ India from scares or from great expenditure. It has not. But it has saved India from attack, for during that time no single -enemy has marched across the glacis of which I have been speaking or has crossed the protective zone. Now if this railway is built, if the theories upon which it is to be constructed are accepted, all these views are wrong. They are to be relegated to the limbo of obsolete and mistaken ideas, and we have now to acclaim and to accept the opposite theory—that the right frontier policy for India is not to close but to open her frontiers upon the west. We are, if assent be given to this railway, to assist in a proposal which will directly connect India on its most vulnerable side— that is, on the west—with the outside world; which will destroy the value of Afghanistan as a buffer State—and His Majesty’s Government should consider the effect which will be produced on the Ameer by this proposal; which will span the desert upon which we have hitherto relied ; which will turn the flank of Quetta, and will provide a route direct from the Russian military base to the borders of India. It is the fact that if this railway be made the Russian troops will be brought 1,000 miles nearer to India than they are at the present moment, and that the Russian War Depart ment at St. Petersburg, should the un happy circumstances ever occur that we should be again at disagreement or at war with that country, will be able to put their troops on the India frontier before reinforce ments sent from England could get to Bombay round the Cape. I see that Colonel Repington, in his letter in The Times this morning, sums up the situation as regards Russia in these words. Assuming the construction of the railway, he says— “ Russia could, in my opinion, deploy within three months such a powerful military force on or near our frontiers that the Army in India would be unable to resist it even provided that all our Field Divisions were available, which I do not think is likely to be the case.” The only ground on which we are invited to run this very considerable risk is that of our present friendly relations with Russia. I rejoice at those relations. There is not a man in this House who does not regard our Entente with Russia as of extreme value, and supposing by any accident the Front Bench opposite were suddenly denuded of its present occupants and we were to step over and take their place we should be as loyal to our engagements with Russia as the Government are at the present time. About that let there be no doubt at all. But, my Lords, history shows too often that international understandings are not eternal. National sentiment, after all, is largely determined by national interests, and national interests are things that vary from year to year and from decade to decade according to the conditions of the hour. Therefore what- erver may be our hopes or desires, it by no means follows that because we are on friendly terms with Russia now we always shall be, or that what we used to call the Russian bogey may not again show its features in the East. Let me put it in a rather more general way. There are two approaches to India—by land and by sea. Hitherto we have had command of both. We have had command of the sea route because we were supreme upon the sea ; we have had command of the land route partly because of our treaties but still more because without a railway it was impracticable to any invader. But now it is doubtful whether, under your new naval arrangements, you are going to keep command of the sea, and at the moment when that command trembles in the balance you propose, if you agree to this railway, gratuitously to surrender your control of the route by land. There are many instances in history in which nations have been compelled by war or defeat to surrender or modify their frontiers, but I honestly do not know of any case in which a great Power, for no reason at all except surrender to what is called the inevitable, has abandoned a frontier so unique as that which is presented to us by nature in those parts.465 The Trans-Persian. Railway. [ LORDS ] The Trans-Persian Railway. I may be pardoned for saying that even in this breathless and staggering age I am too slow to be able to make these rapid changes myself. I am too slow to be willing to abandon, almost at a moment’s notice, all the convictions of my lifetime about Indian defence, all the teachings of all our Generals and Statesmen and Viceroys during the last fifty years, all the accepted dogmas of both political Parties in this country. Before His Majesty’s Government invite us to take such a step—I do not, of course, say they will do so—but before they contemplate inviting us to take such a step I hope they will think, not once, or twice, or twenty times, but a hundred times. I hope they will show better reasons than they have up to now advanced, and I hope they will give us the opinions of their military advisers on the matter. When I was in India a few years ago a scheme, almost identical with this which I have been examining, and which was at that time identified with a Russian officer named Captain Rittich, was sent out to us in India to be reported upon by the Govern ment of India. We advised very strongly against it, and if I remember aright no one was more strong about it than Lord Kitchener, the then Commander-in-Chief. What is the opinion of the Government of India now ? What are the opinions of the military authorities in India and in this country ? What is the advice of the Committee of Imperial Defence ? Sir Edward Grey has been asked in the House of Commons for the opinions of his military ad\ isers, but has answered as if the opinions of those officers were secret oracles which belonged to the Government to be treasured up by them and not revealed to any one else.^ I do not take that view of the opinions of our military advisers. Our military advisers are paid by the nation, and their views on matters of great urgency like this are, in my opinion, the property of the nation. That was the case in regard to the Channel Tunnel. There th e g military advisers were examined before a Parlia mentary Committee ; and if that was done in a matter affecting the security of England surely we have a right to demand the same m a matter affecting the security of India. One other point before I pass away from strategy. The strategical danger to India is not confined to the opening of her frontiers m the manner I have described. There are many people who fear that we shall be Earl Curzon of Kedleston. drawn forward into the open and driven to undertake responsibilities which I am sure every one of us would wish to avoid. We may very likely find ourselves, with this great railway running through Persia compelled to send out garrisons to defend it without the soldiers in India to do it and without the money which would render such a scheme possible. I do not regard such a situation as fantastic. Let us conceive what might very likely arise. It migh.) very well be, the railway having been con structed, that the Persian Government would be powerless to guarantee its security. Russia would obviously—and I do not say wrongly—undertake the policing of that portion of the line which affected her. What about the railway that lay in our sphere l We could not tolerate Russian guards in our sphere. We should inevitably be compelled to take similar steps on our own side ; and it seems to me not unlikely that in this way our Government, whose one desire has been to keep out of these complications, might have to send Indian soldiers to Persia, So much for the question of strategy. Is there any other way in which India would benefit by the construction of this railway ? There is the question of the acceleration of the mails. I dare say there would be some acceleration of mails—a reduction of two or three days, though I doubt very much whether the Government would welcome the transmission of Indian mails exclusively through foreign countries in the future, and in the event of war I imagine that such an arrangement would have to be suspended at once. There may be some convenience to passengers in the reduction of the time spent on the journey, but against this you have to set the fatigue and heat of the journey, impossible at some periods of the year, the certainty almost that women and children could not. travel by such a route, and the certainty that the steamship companies would at once make, as they T could make, in my judgment, a corresponding reduction both in time and fares to meet the competition with which they would be faced. Anyhow', I think your Lordships will agree that in respect of mails and passengers there is nothing on the side of advantage which justifies us in accep ting any risk or sacrifice of Imperial security. 151 nine of tio jreater part 0 ordoiK the interior. of the com caravans. 1 to be constro tradp 1 Hfll , or when before they sth to of any size, centres of able import easeofmor there is not sphere, ai sphere fk rates and to desire or India rememb tinancia able ma coming mercial and wa tries ; a of a Tra Then I pass to the interests of commerce.

The greater part of this trade consists in piece- goods and in tea which is taken from Indian ports, deposited at the Persian harbours, and then put on pony-back, or camel-back or donkey-back and sent up to the towns in the interior. We know that that trade has to suffer many difficulties, difficulties arising li from the severity of the passes, the insecurity of the country, and the cost of the caravans. But supposing this railway to be constructed. How is it to benefit that trade ? How are our goods to do better when they are placed upon the railway at Karachi, or the harbour, wherever it be, and when they have before them the necessarily heavy freights of the railway before they reach the Persian towns ? If you take that part of Persian territory con tiguous to our border which the railway would first touch there are only two cities of any size, Yezd and Kerman, distributing- centres of some but ot no very consider able importance, with a population in neither case of more than 50,000 persons. After that there is nothing until you get into the R ussian sphere, and when once you enter that sphere Russia wdll be able, by her system of rates and rebates at her end of the railway, to destroy any advantages which British or Indian trade may have obtained. I remember wffien I was in India I had as my financial and commercial adviser that very a ble man, -th e late Sir Edward Law. Before coming to India he had served as com mercial attache both in Persia and in Russia, and was warmly attached to both coun tries ; and discussing as w r e did this question of a Trans-Persian line he always stated as his emphatic opinion that such a line, if made, could only act as a feeder for Russian commerce and would be a great detriment both to British and Indian trade. The fact is that if this railway be made we shall really be doing very much the same thing in the sphere of commerce as I have been contending we shall do in the sphere of strategy—that is to say, we shall be reversing the whole of the traditional policy on which we have so far acted. Hitherto our trade with Persia has been seaborne. Now you are going to substitute landborne traffic for seaborne. You are going to divert the trade from the routes which we do command to the routes which we do not. There is one other country that has to be considered, and that is Persia herself. I am sure that if the construction of such a railway as this were to be of benefit to Persia there is no one who would be better- pleased than the members of your Lord- ships’ House. But I wonder if this will be the case. I have been a little struck, in so far as I have been able to follow this matter, with the extent to which Persia seems to have been left out of consideration. I have heard nothing of Persia in connection with the Societe d’Etudes. There is no Persian member upon it, and I have not heard of any Persian finance in connection with the scheme, probably for the very good reason that there is no Persian money forthcoming. Sir Edward Grey, I think, said in his speech that the construction of such a railway would be an advantage to Persia because it would strengthen the central authority and enable it to deal with disturbances. It needs only the slightest acquaintance with the history and geography of Persia to know that the main centres of disturbance are far away from the projected line ; and this railway running through the heart of Persia, from West to East, will no more enable Persia to grapple with the particular difficulties with which she is now confronted than would, for instance, the London and Brighton railway enable His Majesty’s Government to put down a riot in Bodmin or Penzance. Even if Persia were enabled by this scheme to acquire a greater control over her territories—and I am sure we should be glad to see it—she may have to pay a heavy price for it. We have had some experience in recent years of inter national railways. International railways are apt to be followed by international guards, and international guards involve some form of foreign protection, and foreign protection very easily merges into foreign control. Therefore I doubt whether Persia herself will really gain by this railway any substantial addition to her authority, her means of pacifying her own country, or her power. There is only one other matter to which I will refer before I resume my seat. Issues such as those of gauge and of alignment—the reserved topics mentioned by Sir Edward Grey—can very well be postponed until the matter matures. But ought we not to say one word on the question of finance ? I should like to impress upon your Lordships in my con cluding sentences that the financial burden will be very much greater than anybody^ f : 1 il 469 The Trans-Persian Railway. [ LORDS ] The Trans-Persian Railway. 470 at present apprehends. I said just now that estimates of £15,000,000 and £ 20 , 000,000 had been published. I have no time to lay before your Lordships the grounds which lead me to think that the expenditure will probably not be less than £30,000,000. But the question I want to put is, whether it be £ 20 , 000,000 or £30,000,000, where is the money coming from ? Or, if the money is found by the financiers of the three nations to whom I have referred, who is to give the guaran tee ? Because you may be quite certain that without a guarantee the money will not be forthcoming. Will Russia give the guarantee ? At an early stage I saw a statement to the effect that Russia would not accept any obligation on the Russian Treasury for this line, but it is now said that out of the surplus on the Russian rail ways she may be willing to guarantee a loan for the northern section of the line. But when we come to the British section or the Indian section, who is going to give the guarantee ? I confess I cannot imagine the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, or I may add his successor, coming down to the House of Commons and asking the consent of that House to a guarantee for a great railway outside of England, outside of India, in the heart of Persia, about which a great many people will tell him that its construction will add very much to the future burdens of India and of this country and will materially impair the defensive strength of our Indian Empire. I do not see an English Chancellor of the Exchequer making any such proposal, and I do not see any Indian Finance Minister going down to the Council Chamber at Calcutta—I ought now to say Delhi—and explaining to the more repre sentative body created by the noble Viscount opposite, at a time when India is called upon to bear the heavy burden of the cost of the transfer of the capital to Delhi and of the suspension of the opium traffic, and when railway finance is so stinted that there is no money to build more than 100 miles of railway in the present year, that it is proposed to take Indian money and spend it upon a guarantee in respect of a continental line. I cannot imagine an Indian Finance Minister making any such proposal, at any rate with any chance of success. And if neither this country nor India will give a guarantee, then I want to know where the security for the money is coming from. I venture to say that if the scheme, should it eventuate, J Earl Curzon of Kedleston. does not perish before that point, the rock of finance is the one upon which it will founder. May I ask the noble Viscount who will answer me to consider another point ? May it not be said that in the treatment of the railway question in Persia His Majesty’s Government are beginning at the wrong end ? Here they , T) are apparently contemplating presenting' 15 to Persia, a country so poverty stricken and so backward that it has no railways at all—it has, I believe, not more than ten miles of railway Viscount MORLEY : Six miles. *Earl CURZON of KEDLESTON: Here they are apparently contemplating presenting to this country a full-blown continental system without any regard to the commercial interests or the require ments of the country itself, and in com plete ignorance of the fact that in many parts of Persia railways are waiting to be built (the promoters are actually forth coming), which would add to the security of the country, diminish the burdens resting on the Government, and add to Persian trade. Is it not rather an absurd thing at such a moment to force upon that country a great continental scheme which is only introduced in other countries after long years of development and when the con ditions of the country are those of peace and prosperity advanced to a-very high degree ? I should like to hear from the noble Viscount that His Majesty’s Govern ment are prepared to take advantage of the rights which we possess in respect to Persian railways. When we had our last debate here he will remember quoting with some satisfaction the terms of the Rescript of Nasr-ud-Din Shah, under which, if a concession for a railway be given to others in the North, the Shah—and the promise has been confirmed by his succes sors—undertook to give a similar con cession to the British in the South. The case for such a railway has, I think, already been brought into existence. The Russians have obtained their concession in the North. I speak of the concession for the railway from Teheran to Khanikin on the Baghdad line, and there is no reason whatever, therefore, why British proposals should not materialise in the South. I believe that His Majestys Government have taken steps in this matter.

I hope that this may be true, and that His Majesty’s Government may be able to give us some information about it. Here in this smaller policy of internal in Persia is a scheme which I think is practicable, which will not excite any jealousy, which will not raise any alarms in India or anywhere else, and which you may pursue with the knowledge that all parties are agreed upon it. I hope His Majesty’s Government will curtail their ambitions in regard to the larger scheme, and will devote themselves to the humbler task which I have dared to suggest to them. And, above all, I hope that they will not involve this country or the Government of India in the great responsibilities that would result from a change of policy in regard to the defence of India without placing before us in the fullest manner the opinions upon which they propose to act, and that, whatever views they may enter tain themselves, they will not proceed to convert those views into action without giving both Houses of Parliament an oppor tunity of expressing an opinion upon them. I beg to move. Moved, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the project of a Trans-Persian Railway .—(Earl Curzon of Kedleston.) The LORD PRESIDENT oe the COUNCIL (Viscount Morley) : My Lords, the noble Earl expressed the wish that the Government might curtail their ambitions, but the picture he has drawn of the so-called ambitions of the Govern ment is really imaginary and unsupported. I am at a loss to know how, after reading Sir Edward Grey’s speech in another place, the noble Earl should have taken up the attitude that he has done in respect to the Government. It is no discredit to him at all that he is not accurately informed as to the immediate relations of the Govern ment to this Societe d’Etudes. The noble Earl has fallen into various errors as to the facts and circumstances connected with that body and our relations to it, which I must point out to him and to your Lord- ships. The proposal—there is no conceal ment about it—was initiated in Russia. The promoters of this body were Russian (D 375) promoters in the first instance. They have had no support whatever from His Majesty’s Government beyond the negative refusal to veto their existence and to pro hibit their operations so far as we could. Not one atom of money has found its way from our Exchequer to the chest of that body. The noble Earl has been entirely misinformed when he tells your Lordships that the two Ministers at Teheran, the Russian Minister and our own, approached the Persian Government and invited them to give facilities for the operations of this commission. There has been no com munication of that sort. Then the noble Earl said that we had encouraged this body and its operations. That is entirely imaginary. We have not encouraged it beyond the fact that when the proposal was presented to us we examined it—the fact of the proposal, not the contents of it—and in describing that as encouragement and in taxing us with using diplomatic machinery the noble Earl is entirely wide of the mark. The noble Earl made a point that supposing this body were to report in favour of some through line of which we, when the time comes, disapprove, it would be impossible for us with diploma tic decency and consistency to withstand the report of that body. I cannot imagine anything that has been said by any member of the Government—certainly not by Sir Edward Grey, who is the only person, I think, who has spoken officially—which could warrant the view that we should not be justified in dealing with perfect freedom with the report of this body. The noble Earl talked of the rapidity with which this proceeding had gone on, and he said that last year when I had the honour of following him in debate—in March, I think—I gave him a sort of assurance that nothing was on foot. My language does not bear that *Earl CURZON of KEDLESTON : I did not say that. I merely read the noble Viscount’s words. I did not draw any inference from them. Viscount MORLEY : The word I used in that debate was “ immature.” There was nothing disingenuous in that. There was no suggestion that there was no project on foot. I ask the noble Earl, Does he of all men think that this question of Persian railways is at all a new one ? He knows better than anybody in the House, from his experience in two Government Offices and in473 The Trans-Persian Railway. [LORDS] The Trans-Persian Railway. 471 India, that since the year 1872 the question of railways in Persia, including the Trans continental railway, has been a thoroughly live issue. In 1872 there was, if I remember aright, a Committee of the House of Commons appointed. That was the first Committee which inquired into this question of Persian railways. From 1872 to 1888 there was a stream of applications from Germans, Russians, Frenchmen, Americans, to Persia for concessions, some of them on a grand and magnificent scale and others entirely insignificant. Still there was a constant series of applications ; and at the end of it all—as I interrupted the noble Earl towards the end of his speech to say— at the end of it all Persia possesses only six miles of railway, which runs to the shrine of a Persian saint. Then came the period from 1888 to 1890. The noble Earl must be fully cognisant of the stream of tele grams and despatches that went on during those two years between the late Lord Salisbury and his Ministers both at St. Petersburg and Teheran, all going fully into the very kind of arguments—the more important of them, at all events—which the noble Earl has brought forward to-night, and coming to a conclusion. There was a pause from 1890 onwards, and then came the pamphlet of Captain Rettich, referred to by the noble Earl, on which the noble Earl himself wrote a very elaborate antagonistic Memorandum. I submit, therefore, that the noble Earl greatly exaggerated when he suggested that we had sprung something upon Europe or upon this country or upon Parliament. The question entered a new phase about the end of 1910, and this proposal was submitted for our consideration. I would like to ask the noble Earl what he would have done if this proposal for a Societe d’Etudes had been brought before him. Were we to say, “ We will not look at it; we have a frontier policy in India conse crated ”—as the noble Earl would have put it most eloquently—“ by the decisions of great men for many generations ; we will not listen to this ? ” That would have been a very heroic attitude. There is not a man in this House who is not fully conscious of all the arguments that the noble Earl has brought forward to-night about keeping as long as ever we can a frontier on the Persian side of mountain and of desert. The military advantage of preserving that frontier, if we could do it, is quite obvious, and we do not want all this trumpet- Viscount Morley. blowing—I am not referring for the moment to the noble Earl—all this trumpet-blowing in the newspapers and so forth as to the dangers to which we are exposing India. tages that could co-operation. The Let me go back. What w r ould you have done ? There is no doubt that any detri ment to that frontier of mountains and desert does expose India to some dis advantages. But suppose we had said,* when this proposal was made, “ We will turn our backs upon all proposals of this kind ; wm will not listen.” Would that blunt and bluff negative have been an extinguisher to the whole business ? The noble Earl is a great deal too well acquainted with the currents and sub-currents, diplo matic, commercial, and political, which are running to suppose for a moment that the business would remain under that extin guisher. It would not be so ; and anybody must have a very superficial knowledge of the political and diplomatic conditions and relations of this country in connection with India, among other things, who would dream for a moment that nothing would follow. The question which has been left all these years would undoubtedly remain, but it would have assumed a new aspect; and when the noble Earl says, and says truly enough, that this may involve a change in the conditions of frontier policy, I would point out that you would not have avoided that by simply giving a point-blank refusal to this proposal. A man must have a very superficial knowledge—I am not thinking of the noble Earl—of the diplomatic state of Europe and must have a very narrow power of political imagination if he does not see, after we had declined, gruffly or with polite evasions, to assent to anything involving the principle of the Trans-Persian railway, that a set of arrangements easily naturally devised, in view of all the political and military consequences involved in them, would or might have led—I think would have led—to a very large extension in other w T ays from those which now alarm the noble Earl of frontier defence and military expen diture in India. That is a point that I do urgently press upon your Lordships. The Government of India is just as sensible as we are that a point-blank refusal to assent, not to the railway, but to an examination of the present proposal, might have led to combinations that would involve disadvan tages to our Indian position much more serious in their character than the disadvan- arise from this limited talked ata by the rear ago! ♦IablCEZ jo about fifty Yiscoust ! exce we are peri results of tl fatalistic in noble Earl’i lay or oth fit be cor Aon this ] No, we w we will usi &gt;mg,a] it’?” If would be ' wit' «st 01 US ^ perfect! ?°t, the475 The Trans-Persian Railway.

I have 'Lifroitf f la( f occasion to think a good deal about the ® Jujf scheme, and I agree that the prospects } a ;p fr ,: : of its financial success would not strike raI1S f „ most of us as satisfactory. The noble Earl is perfectly right when he says that, ie ' 0 , u according to the best opinions that can be got, the estimated profits, if they are -.j measured by Indian standards, are put four-fifths too high; they will be only D °V W one-fifth of the estimated amount. And eand®^;: t p e no bl e Earl is not far wrong, according I s 3 . to Indian precedents, in what he says of the 0 nr I#- cos ^ ^be railway. He puts it at £30,000,000 instead of £ 20 , 000 , 000 —some npref ® 21 people say it will be £40,000,000. We toan^; a re quite alive to all those considerations. t The point has been taken—and I confess [(]in# f J, x do not see any answer to it when I , 0 ^ consider the authorities who make it— y that Russian trade is very likely to get more profit out of this line than we are likely to do. That may be. That is an argument which the Government of the day will have to consider when they have the report forwarded to them. No doubt the cost of construction through a moun tainous country where labour is scarce, where communications are very difficult, and where I suppose contracts will not be prepared on purely abstract benevolent principles will be very formidable. But however that may be, the working of the line and the earning of profits will be a slow and gradual process. All the noble Earl’s arguments about the immense difficulty of land transport competing with the cheapness and facility and accustomedness of the sea route will operate. I was rather surprised to hear the noble Earl, after he had very carefully analysed all those elements, then say that the Government were favouring a line which would perhaps carry the mails or not carry the mails, which might or might not carry an increased number of passengers, and so forth. But does he not perceive that when the construction of this line and any support of it by His Majesty’s Government is under consideration all those elements will be deciding elements ? To suppose that we have already made up our minds to cast them all aside and to neglect these points is really to make us out more rash and heedless than the noble Earl had any right to do. As to this line not benefiting our trade but Russian trade, I would like to observe, in passing, that that very important set of people the Moscow mer chants do not think so ; they think the exact opposite, and they are now loud in their complaints that this line would lead to a great improvement of British and other foreign trade at their expense. The noble Earl must bear that in mind. Nobody pretends that Great Britain, and India, and the whole general trade of the world will not benefit from the creation of a better state of things in Persia. It is clear that wherever you get a better state of social well-being you get a greater demand for goods. Where you have roads and com munications markets are improved. I wish some of my friends—the noble Earl referred to them—in the Press would realise what the difficulties now are, and how far those difficulties would be affected by_ railways whether a trunk line, or branch lines from the ports which in many ways we should477 The Trans-Persian Railway. [LORDS] The Trans-Ptrsian Railway. 47 $ be inclined to prefer. I wish they would realise the difficulties of trade in Persia— insecurity, inefficient and corrupt adminis tration, maladministration of justice, the great distance between giving an order and its execution, the long delay of exchange remittances, the impossibility of super vising and controlling mercantile transac tions—all these difficulties will be lessened by improved communications. They will yield to improved communications, and they are very little likely to yield to any thing else. If I may venture upon a private observation I am not at all sure that those are not right who, instead of railways, recommend, not caravan roads, but cart roads, as they would be less expensive, and so forth. But that is a question that I have no right to go into to-night. Supposing circumstances com pelled the Government of the day, whoever they may be, to adopt the railway policy the precedents are not quite encouraging. Though the overland route from London to Constantinople competes with the sea route, the latter suffers no disadvantage at all in consequence of this competing land route. Then we have been told a great deal during the discussions about the Siberian Railway. I rather think that some of the Russian advocates of this line have pointed to the Siberian railway. There is no real parallel at all. *Earl CURZON op KEDLESTON ; Hear, hear. railway and the Anglo-Russian Convention are the elements that have made this proposal actual. As to the effect upon the confusion of Persia one thing is certain, and will not be denied by anybody who has any idea of government in any part of the world and who is at all acquainted with—shall I call it—the chaos that exists in many parts of Persia—namely, that railways would immensely increase } nnwpr nf flip. T*ptsi 0 fief' .in vonr jjiaiipxw 1 M subjed Sent one of lad reproach Viscount MORLEY : I am glad the noble Earl agrees, because there is no real parallel at all between the Siberian railway and this Trans-Persian railway. The Siberian railway shortens the distance from the centre of Europe to the Far East by one-half. Then it gives a direct rail way route much shorter than the sea route, not merely to India, but to an area infinitely larger in size than India, com prising as well the important seaports of China and of Japan. The only other observation I make about the Siberian railroad is that on that there is an immense emigration traffic. On the Trans-Persian line there is no reason to suppose that there will be any emigration traffic at all. I was disappointed, I admit, at what the noble Earl said about the effect of this line upon Persia. I do not suppose for a moment that this line or any other line or any number of them would bring the millennium to Persia. The confusion in Persia along with the advent of the Baghdad Viscount Morley. the power of the Persian Government in dealing with disorder and maintaining something a little more like security. I saw the other day some emphatic language of a very competent observer who knows Persia well. He says that to introduce railways, including this trunk line, would be to put the most powerful weapon into the hands of the Central Government in Persia, which is to-day a mere shadow and can be derided with impunity. I was surprised that some political friends of mine who are so anxious that we should be more active on the popular side of affairs in Persia should be the most indignant of all at the idea of a measure which would do more than any other, if it were financially workable and so forth, to put into the hands of the Persian Government the power of managing their own affairs and holding up their heads, in the language of my friends, against both Russia and England. 1 oily saG selves fte op 1 not anv at m mome: jjiard against Memoinms etoeke in ?ould be interests am irontier. V option of I will not detain your Lordships longer. The whole question of the alignment and the terms on which the railroad is to be administered and controlled, the question of whether the profits made on the northern lines ought to be pooled with the profits made in the south, a much more dubious quantity—all these are matters which this House and the other House and the country can consider much more effectively when they have a definite scheme presented to them. It is said, “ You have never con sulted Persia.” It will be quite time enough to consult Persia as to a concession when we and the other Powers concerned have made up our minds as to what is the concession we ought to ask for. Let us then make up our minds what is the best alignment and what all these other sub sidiary arrangements ought to be. The noble Earl, I hope, will not think that I have at all shirked the important dis cussion that he raised about the alignment of the route. He will understand that some of those projected routes involve considerations of extreme danger, and therefore I have not thought it worth while leading tl have, pei tional sit stands in fill not not twice *Lom) tbe repl I am 5 regard t( light on ment of eating t from tii thwart interest pntson the ko this Go479 The Trans-Persian Railway.

It is an extraordinarily intricate and com plex subject. It is barely intelligible without one of those maps which the noble Earl reproached me for producing last year, and therefore I will not attempt to follow him over that area. I only say that in keeping open to our- Ives the option of asking for railway concessions when the proper time comes we have not designed and do not design to shut out all foreign enterprise from Persia. That would be a great disadvantage to Persia, and not any advantage to ourselves. It must be clearly stated that we have no desire to make this' railway ourselves in Persia at this moment, but we may well wish to guard against the possibility of waking up some morning and finding that the Persians have placed some important concessions elsewhere involving foreign control which would be detrimental to our political interests and strategically menacing to our frontier. We therefore desire to have the option of making railways of that sort ourselves in case Persia favours foreign enterprise. I hope the House, in con sidering the noble Earl s speech and in reading the arguments, of which we shall have, perhaps, a plethora in the next few months, will remember the strictly condi tional situation in which the Grovernment stands in respect of all these proposals, and will not forget, although there may be drawbacks, which we do not deny, to the Trans-Persian railway, that any Govern ment that might succeed us would think, not twice but a hundred times, before they repudiated and turned their backs upon our action. *Lord LAMINGTON : My Lords, I do not know whether the noble Earl will think the reply of the noble Viscount opposite has been a satisfactory one. I confess that I am still considerably dismayed with regard to it. It has, however, thrown some light on what has led up to the establish ment of this Societe d’Etudes. It is inter esting to see that the _ Government have from time to time desired apparently to thwart this railway project, and equall\ interesting to see that whenever they have put some obstacle in the way of the project the Russian Government have been quite agreeable, so desirous have they been to see some scheme adopted, to accept whatever this Government have proposed. The noble Viscount opposite referred to the many railway projects in Persia which have been put before the public for a number of years past. He did not say why not one of them has ever come to fruition. And do not the same reasons that prevented those lines from being constructed equally hold good to-day as to why this line should not be constructed ? The light which the noble Viscount has thrown upon the present proposal seems to show that the line is not desired by His Majesty’s Government, that they have not done what they have done willingly, that they have not done it because they considered it good to Persia or to India but because of some other alternative— because some rebuff that they would have had to administer would have led to serious and disastrous consequences. The noble Viscount speaks of the sub currents of diplomacy that are going on. I do not know of them, being a man in the street, and I do not know what disastrous consequences would have ensued from a polite disclaimer. But I do not see how it is going to improve the position when a few months hence this Societe d’Etudes may possibly furnish a satisfactory report. What then will be the duty of His Majesty’s Government l Will they be in a better position to refuse then than they are now l The objections to the line as put forward by the noble Earl and also as stated by The Times Military Correspondent—all so powerful and forcible—would remain just as great eighteen months hence as they are to-day. How will the Government then be in a better position to reject the scheme ? It seems to me only to intensify the evil, and if the line does involve a certain amount of risk to India that risk will be just as great then as now. I share, like the noble Earl, a belief in universal peace between the great nations of the earth and that India will be linked up by railway com munication with the rest of the world. But there is no need to anticipate that day. The conditions that have rendered it undesirable in the past are just as strong to-day, and until you change the environ ment of affairs you are merely putting new wine into old bottles by allowing this line to be constructed. I know of no single commercial body in India or in this country that desires to see this line built—with one exception only, the Chamber of Commerce at Karachi. The chairman, Mr. Webb, is a great believer, as I am also, in the future of Karachi as one of the principal Indian ports, and he is,8 38 id 481 The Trans-Persian Railway. [ LORDS ] The Trans-Persian Railway. 482 naturally keen to see his hopes realised at once. And in Karachi being made the terminus of the Trans-Persian railway no doubt Karachi would be very much uplifted. But even the Chamber of Commerce realise that there is a risk, and the Government recognise the risk, because, as we under stand from the papers, there has been an obligation imposed by the Government and admitted by the noble Viscount that the alignment should, if required, be brought down within reach of the coast with the idea that our naval forces would be able to command that line in case of any emergency. I think that is a sufficient argument without waiting for the utterances of the military experts and others to show what a danger lies in this line when you propose to divert it in order to bring it within command of your sea forces so as to prevent its being used as a hostile instrument in the event of invasion. First of all, it is very obvious you would have to have a much stronger force than you have at the present time in Indian waters if you wish to secure the line by such means. But I am quite content merely to take that argument to show what a great danger there is in having a line to India linked up with the outside world by railway communication, and, as I say, the conditions that rendered it undesirable in the past still obtain at the present moment. I am not one of those who wish to represent that the utterances of the Press are to be taken as indicating the views of the whole of the nation. I would not for a moment think that the carping criticisms which are sometimes uttered in the Press of this country against Germany indicate the feelings of the people of this country against the people of tnat nation. But there is one very notable Russian journal, the Nome Vremya, and that paper recently, just previous to the interview at the Baltic port, published a very lengthy article with reference to the relations of Germany and Great Britain. Let me read two quotations. One is— “ On the other hand, only the loss of India bv England, from whatever cause, would establish permanent peace between us and her.” Then it goes on— Russia ought to rejoice that somebody has arisen to tight the enemy who for a hundred” years stood m her way everywhere. Is it not Enof'and’s hegemony at sea which has compelled us to stop dead, as before a stone wall, in all the Easts—the h-ear, the Middle, and the Far East? Is it not this hegemony which will keep us back in our natural evolution on two continents in the future ?’ T Lord Lamington. I associate myself entirely with the words spoken by the noble Earl as to the value of the friendly relations subsisting between us and Russia, but we only have to look back to our foreign relations during the last twenty years with the different Powers of the world to see how shifting and how variable these relations are; and really the sole excuse for the putting forward of this scheme at the present time is our Entente * with Russia. All the other objections * 1 remain exactly as they have been for the last fifty or a hundred years, and whilst we earnestly hope that the Entente may be continued for many long years to come we ought not to consent to the con struction of a permanent work of such a character as a railway line on such a very shifting foundation or base as that which I have described. I do not think the noble Viscount vouchsafed any reply as to our having the opinion of the military experts and as to putting ourselves into the position that this country was in when a Committee reported on the project of the proposed Channel Tunnel. Surely we ought to have the views of the Council of Defence on this matter. We ought also to know whether the Board of Trade have considered the commercial advantages of this fine. I think we are entitled to have put before Parliament the views of these different bodies. I think it is admitted that there is practically no commercial advantage in this line to India—nothing that will pay a half per cent, on capital; and you have this very great risk and also the great expenditure the Government would have to incur by giving a guarantee. I am surprised to find that the noble \ iscount has been bold enough to stand up and make an apology for this project. He has refused on two or three occasions to consider a poor little railway in the Aden Hinterland, a railway which would open up the fertile country around and give relief to your sun-baked garrison at Aden by letting them get to a hill station, and which would not cost your Government a single rupee. Lord Morley when the autocratic Secretary of State for India would have nothing to do with that small project; yet here the noble \ iscount ventures to defend a project of great risk without any possible advantage to India and with only a minimum of advantage to Persia. The noble Viscount, in his reply, dilated upon the benefit to Persia of improved com- iare my ^ ® most ear (links fit- really to t ! lenefit of 1 kcame real create mist Enssia, It ment of oru score alone: itoushtto line inter- will noth very nec&lt; governme render In two pron lately w One salt aboot i be donf in Engl, scarce pleasar arid c&lt; do not of tie the agrea a mm neitbe; were484 483 The Trans-Persian Railway.

If you have a line inter-connected by this railway you will not increase that confidence that is so very necessary for our good and firm government of India ; you will at once render India more liable to scares. I asked two prominent Indians who were over here lately what they thought of this scheme. One said that he did not know very much about it, but that it certainly should not be done until we have compulsory service in England. The other said that it might be a nice thing for India because then the Indians would be able to go into Persia and establish themselves there. That gentle man spoke with a great lack of knowledge of the conditions that prevail in Persia if he thinks that Indian labour, which is so scarce at the present time, will find any pleasant outlet into Persia, that dry and arid country where in most places they do not find enough water to perform their daily ablutions. There is, to my mind, no advantage to be gained by this line, and, on the other hand, there is every possible risk. It could be said in favour of the Channel Tunnel—it was admitted by the Committee—that it would lead to a great improvement in commerce and to a much greater passenger traffic; but neither of those conditions would prevail were this line built. I therefore hope that the Government will not be too benevolently disposed towards the inquiry that is being held, and I think they will only put themselves into a much weaker position if they have to reject the proposal hereafter. There are plenty of other lines that can be constructed in Persia with the greatest advantage to that country and that can be reasonably undertaken on a friendly basis between ourselves and Russia. Those could be made without violating any portion of those great natural defences with which Providence has favoured India. *Lokd INCHCAPE : My Lords,-1 asso ciate myself with what has fallen from the noble Earl, and I would venture to ask your Lordships to consider for a moment the financial and practical side of this proposed railway through Persia. The British section, or it may be the Indian section, will start from Karachi and run through 920 miles of unpopulated, un fertile, and waterless country, and, as Lord Lamington said, those who promote the line admit that it must be close to the shore through the Makran district in order that it may be shelled by our ships in the event of its being used in a hostile manner against India. The traffic that the line would create would probably be about sufficient to fill a single truck in a fortnightly train. I submit that the Government of India have quite enough on their hands for many years to come in developing their own railway system. With your Lordships’ permission I desire to dwell for a moment on the position of Indian railways. Some five or six years ago I was appointed by the noble Viscount, who was then Secretary of State for India to be Chairman of a Committee to inquire into and report upon the development of the Indian railway system. One member of that Committee was the Financial Secretary at the India Office, Mr. Lionel Abrahams. Another member was an ex- Financial Member of the Council of the Governor-General of India, Sir David Barbour, a gentleman who was closely associated with Lord Lansdowne, when Viceroy of India, in his great work of putting the currency of the country on a stable basis. Another member was Sir Felix Schuster, an eminent financial authority in the City of London. The unanimous con clusion of that Committee was that India should spend not less than£12,500,000 upon the development of her railway system, and that the expenditure of that sum would be a profitable proposition. A further recommendation was that the money in the first place should be devoted to the equipment of the lines then opened, which were lamentably short of rolling-stock. Since that time there has been devoted to485 The Trans-Persian Pailway. [ LORDS ] The Trans-Persian Pailway. the railways of India every penny which the Government of India could spare from its surplus balances, and every penny which could be borrowed in England and in India on the security of the revenues of India, and every penny which the railway companies could borrow in this country, but the twelve and a-half millions have never been reached. I spent last winter in India, and having been appointed President of a Conference between the Government of India and the railway companies to try and settle some long out-standing differences, I had occasion during the course of my in vestigations to travel some 12,000 miles over the railway systems of India. And, my Lords, what did I see ? From Bombay in the west to Calcutta and Madras in the east, from the Himalayas in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, practically every large railway station was congested with goods for which there were no means of transport to be found. The mills in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras were dangerously near the end of their coal supplies, ships were hung up in the Hugh for want of coal, which had gone to famine prices, although at the mouths of the pits in the Bengal coalfields not 150 miles away from Calcutta I saw tens of thousands of tons of coal piled up, which reminded me of that old song “ Wait for the Wagon.” There were no means of getting the coal down to the seaboard. It was anticipated when I was there dn March that things would mend by May, but only the other day an in fluential deputation waited upon the Secre tary of State for India and represented to him that the state of affairs was still as bad as ever. I impute no blame to the India Office, to the Government of India, to the Railway Board, or to the directors and managers of the great railway com panies in India who manage the railways so admirably for the Government. When I went to India about forty years ago there was a cry for more permanent way and more rolling-stock. That cry has gone on every year since then, and the cry exists to-day. The fact is it is difficult to get sufficient money in this country, where the capital alone can be found, to meet the railway requirements of India, and it has been more difficult than ever in the past five years through young countries being opened up and trade being so active all the world over. The Three-and- Lord Inchcape. a-Half per cent. Loans of the Government of India, which used to stand well over par, are now under 92, and so long as trade con tinues active, and so long as India con tinues to be a borrowing Government, we cannot expect to see her annual issues absorbed except at constantly dwindling prices. The outlook at the moment for getting more money for Indian railways is by no means bright. The opium revenue); is being relinquished, as the noble Earl said, for the supposed moral and material benefit of the blue-robed nation, although, if recent reports are correct, as the poppy cultivation diminishes in Hindustan it increases in the Celestial Empire. 187 ik Ifo* military, or da country’ 3 ilk we aboil ♦ The L01 had no rnte Then, my Lords, the Government of India is faced with an expenditure in the immediate future of several millions sterling, it may be four, it may be six, it may be eight, I think it will probably be ten millions, for the new capital at Delhi. All this means that there will be less money available for irrigation, for railways, and for other reproductive works in India. I have heard it stated—although I felt somewhat reassured by the statement of the noble Viscount that nothing was being done in connection with this railway—that the survey has either been begun or is about to be undertaken from Karachi to Charbar. It would be a distinct misfortune if the resources of the North-western State railway were to be squandered on a project of this kind instead of being laid out in providing that rolling-stock which is so necessary to enable it to handle the goods which it is now unable to carry. I submit that the time is inopportune for the Government to think of building a line from Karachi either to the centre or to the confines of Persia—a law which will never pay its working expenses, far less interest upon the cost of its con struction. I submit that the funds at the disposal of the Government of India should be employed in the development of the railway system of that country and not wasted on a silly project of this description. Even if the money is found by outside financiers the effect will be the same. If the interest is guaranteed on the cost of construction and if the guarantee comes from the revenues of India it will be a dissi pation of the credit of the Secretary of State and a charge upon the revenues of the country. I strongly urge, therefore, that neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Government of India should have anything to do with the building of this upon one oi teen raised tk extent to x were impli Trans-Pere accurate, noticed tk m no mei committe to regarc made ai immedia my nob * 1 down a: I am si does wi than th ingtoa; was on Dot alre responsi project.

I further urge that they should not guarantee a sixpence of interest on the cost of the construction of a railway from which we have nothing to gain either from a political, a military, or a commercial point of view. For, after all is said and done, the first line of a country’s defence is solvency; and I think we should refrain from embarking on an enterprise, however attractive the name may be, which is calculated to hang a financial burden round our necks for years to come. *The LORD PRIVY SEAL and SECRETARY or STATE uor INDIA (The Marquess or Crewe) : My Lords, I had no intention of intervening in this debate, but perhaps I might say a word upon one or two of the points which have been raised by noble Lords opposite. I think that my noble friend Lord Morley showed that the picture which the noble Earl opposite drew in his opening speech, a somewhat alarming picture, as to the extent to which His Majesty’s Government were implicated in the proposition of a Trans-Persian railway, was not entirely accurate. But, in spite of that fact, I noticed that when Lord Lamington pursued his share in the debate he again accused us in no measured terms of being completely committed to this project, and he seemed to regard the railway as being as good as made and the frontier of India in almost immediate danger. I am bound to say that my noble friend behind me who has just sat down and whose intervention in the debate I am sure we all welcomed, speaking as he does with great authority, also went further than the facts altogether justify in appear ing to assume that the Government of India was on the point of undertaking, if it had not already undertaken, serious financial responsibilities in connection with this project. On the question of defence, we should all, I suppose, agree that as a purely abstract proposition, India being what it is and governed as it is, it is a thorough con venience to ourselves aud no real disad vantage to the people of India that it should be isolated from direct communication by land with the outer world. The great mountain ranges, the inviolable desert frontiers, the impenetrable stretches of jungle, all have had much to do in making the history of India what it is to-day, and we should all admit, as I say, as an abstract proposition, that a continuance of that state of things could not be altogether (D 375) distasteful to us. I do not mind admitting a personal view which is of no particular interest to anybody but myself, that I have more than a sneaking sympathy with the objections which Lord Palmerston took to the making of the Suez Canal from the point of view of our Indian Empire. I am quite prepared to admit that if we had had the great sea route to India as our main route and the overland route for those who were in a hurry, crossing the Isthmus at Suez, we in India should not have been greatly the worse. At the same time we have to admit—the noble Earl has expli citly admitted it himself—that even if we do not like to call a particular railway inevit able, yet the tendency of railway construc tion, of increased trade, and also of inter national relations, points in the direction of railway construction in Persia, and that construction, whether it involves or not— as to which I will say a word in a moment— the construction of a Trans-Persian railway as such, undoubtedly awakes new questions of frontier defence. I might say, for the information of the noble Earl and of the House, that this particular matter of a possible Trans- Persian railway has not been formally considered by the Committee of Defence because it is not in any sense yet a live project. The subject has been considered by the General Staff in India, and in con sidering it they, of course, expressed marked preferences for certain schemes of alignment in comparison with others. Some they thought far more disadvantageous and even dangerous than others from the Indian point of view. But on the whole subject they took the view that it might be a disadvantageous and even a dange: ous thing to pronounce an absolute veto on the proposal when it was made in this quite tentative form, on the ground that if you were prepared not to dismiss the principle altogether, and if—which is a very large “ if ’’— the money was forthcoming for the making of the railway and prepara tions proceeded for its construction, then you would be able to secure that it should be made in the way least detrimental to your interests ; whereas if you attempted to interpose a veto, and nevertheless the railway was made, it would very probably then be made in the manner least advan tageous to Indian interests. From that point of view the General Staff in India did not consider themselves debarred, but quite the contrary, from examining the project C e489 The Tram-Persian Railway. [ LORDS ] The Trans-Persian Railway. 490 from the defeiice point of view and express ing a preference for certain alignments and their conviction of the necessity for certain safeguards ; because they recognised that it was impossible not to realise, bearing in mind what the noble Earl and other noble Lords have said, the possible destructibility of any existing arrangement as between European Powers, and that it was impos sible to shut your eyes to the possibility of certain other combinations through which or by means of which, the line might be made in spite of our declared intention to have nothing to do with it so far as the Indian frontier part of it was concerned. My noble friend behind me drew attention to the fact that some of those who ordinarily support His Majesty’s Government in domestic politics and to some extent also in foreign politics have uttered somewhat severe strictures on the assumed action of His Majesty’s Government in this matter of a Trans-Persian railway. One might ask them, as my noble friend asked the noble Earl, What is the precise step which in the circumstances they would have taken ? What do they consider to be the error that we have so far committed—I will not say in not vetoing the institution of this Societe d’Etudes, because I do not see how we could have prevented its inception although we might possibly have prevented certain persons from joining it—but in somehow not placing a veto on the project in a manner the precise form of which I confess lam unable to conceive ? It is one of the curious ironies of history that brings some of those pacific friends of ours into the precise position which thirty and more years ago those very different people enjoyed who delighted in the doggerel song of which the word “ Jingo ” is, I supposed the only survival at this'moment. I hope they will see that we have not committed His Majesty’s Government, not merely to any participation in this proposed line if it be made, but to any definite approval of the line. We are not prepared on principle as the noble Earl reminded us my right hon. friend used the words “ the principle of the undertaking in another place—we are not prepared on principle to say that this line shall not be made. But that is a very different story from the kind of participa tion in the project of which in some quarters we are accused. And on that I should like so far as possible to reassure my noble friend behind me. Lord Inchcape, as to the The Marquess of Crewe. attitude of the Government of India and the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the matter of finance. He said with great truth that all the money that is available for Indian railways is required for those rail ways. It is required to a very large extent for the improvement of rolling- stock and for the improvement of lines in all manner of ways by widening and the provision of marshalling sidings and a number of other improvements. If money were forthcoming there are also new branch lines in many directions which we should be glad to make. We are entirely alive to the importance of not squandering Indian money which might be devoted to our own railways upon a project of this kind. I certainly have no desire to expend a single rupee of Indian money on such a project as this. And as to the question of guaranteeing a return for the lines, if and when they are opened, alto gether apart from the question of assisting in any way in the construction, we have entered into no engagement of the kind. We are under no engagement to the pro moters of this line to assist this railway should it be made. To continue the question of the con struction of the main line, there is this other point of view which arises out of what fell from the noble Earl when he drew attention to the possible advantage to Persia in the construction of various rail ways through districts which, as he stated, needed the service of a railway more than those districts through which a perfectly direct Trans-Persian line would pass. It is certainly not for me to prophesy, but it is, of course, quite possible that the immediate future of Persian railway con struction may be brought about in that form. I, for one, certainly should not complain if it were, but would welcome it. It may come about that railways may be made in Persia piecemeal, and that one day we may wake up and find that a Trans- Persian railway thereby exists just as the London and North Western Railway, to name only one instance, was composed of four or five different lines before you were able to travel by it through to Manchester or through to Carlisle. That is, of course, a possible outcome. But I hope that if the noble Earl proposes to say anything more in replying on the debate he will absolve us from having unduly com plicated our position in Persia or of having implicated His Majesty’s Government in i part '^ 1 gy as he c .uli maV he i we do ^ n jg acton n mlicv he mil trust th U « have ♦ Em CH answer and hy the Lords said made by before yon, tie circnms them with almost imp answer to t I do not k i Sovemme it, It ha that the ment is proposal ment tl financier ment I &lt; Lord J serious if the B other liii matic or put on, e or in Ind Viscor word tha that con more % 8 L Exactly; before. f which IH 49I The Trans-Persian Railway.

We recognise fully as he could the various objections which may be raised on different grounds %to the construction of this particular line.

Both noble Lords said to me, “ Had the proposals made by the Societe d’Etudes come before you, what would you have done in the circumstances ? Would you have met them with a point-blank refusal ? ” It is almost impossible for me to give a direct answer to the question, because, of course, I do not know the form in which the pro posal first came before His Majesty’s Government. I have no idea who started it. It has been assumed more than once that the influence of the Russian Govern ment is behind it. M hether * the first proposal came to His Majesty s Govern ment through a group of independent financiers or through the Russian Govern ment I do not know. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, more than once hinted, although in somewhat obscure terms that serious consequences might have ensued if the British Government had taken any other line. He hinted at pressure, diplo matic or otherwise, that might have been put on, either in this country or in Persia or in India. Viscount MORLEY : I never used any word that carried pressure with it. I said that combinations might naturally and easily develop—arrangements which would be more disadvantageous than any that are now proposed. *Earl CURZON or KEDLEBTON: Exactly; but I am no wiser than I was before. The noble Viscount indulged m language of obscurity in his first speech which I am bound to say he has not in the least degree removed by his subsequent explanation. I cannot say, therefore, what I would have done in the circum- trl ble alia® )nofraB : lick a f wuWj® railtf ouM* •ailwaft 5 * anl'ia' tisjk” lopej siyaf uwliJf fl ' , n t0 I stances. But I think I may say what I would not have done. The noble Marquess seemed to think just now that the action of His Majesty’s Government had been confined to not placing a veto—I think those were his words—upon the scheme. Surely they have gone a great deal further than that. What I would not have done would have been to say what the Secre tary of State said in the House of Commons. He distinctly stated that, given the satis factory conditions required by the Govern ment, the Government were “ in principle ” favourable to the scheme. That has never been said before by a British Government. It was not the view of the Government of my day, either in England or in India. They were in principle unfavourable to the scheme. Really if you have a Secretary of State making this pronouncement deliberately on behalf of his Government in the House of Commons you cannot be surprised if the result is what it has been namely, that your friends think that you have given to the proposal a support perhaps in excess of that which you have actually done. Certainly that impression exists, as you have admitted, in your own newspapers. It exists in both Houses of Parliament, and I am not certain that a lingering element of it does not exist in my own mind still. To give a concrete example. I think the noble Marquess somewhat dissented from the idea that any active steps had been taken in pursuance of these plans by the Government of India. I would point out that it is notorious that an engineeer has been sent out—I know his name and all about him—by the Govern ment of India from Karachi to investigate the country lying between Karachi and the Persian border. If the Government are merely not imposing a veto on the scheme, why should they take this active step and associate themselves with it ? I am bound to say for my own part that if there has been any misinterpretation of the Government’s attitude they have only themselves to thank. The noble Marquess was kind enough to give us some information with regard to the opinions that have reached him from the authorities, military and otherwise. He told us that the Committee of Imperial Defence have not yet been consulted. If these plans take a shape later on that will require them to be placed before that Committee I do most earnestly hope that we shall be favoured with their opinion.493 The Trans-Persian Railway. [ LORDS ] The Trans-Persian Railway. 431 As regards the Military Staff in India, it is difficult for me to speak with exactitude about that, because in my day there was no Military Staff that gave an opinion as distinct from the Government of India. The military opinions of the Government of India were given by the Governor- General in Council. There appears to be a difference now. Here, again, it transpires from what the noble Marquess said that the Military Staff were never consulted upon the policy of the line. All that happened was that they were asked to give an opinion as to this or that align ment. They were told that unless the line were made some ulterior consequences of a formidable kind would ensue, and therefore their advice was offered on the scheme on the lines of what would be the least unfavourable to the Government of India. That carries an implication which I would like to dispose of. It seems to lie in the background of the thoughts of the noble Marquess and the noble Viscount that if His Majesty’s Govern ment had not signified in some degree their sympathy with these proposals they would have been carried out without them. That has lain behind both their speeches to-night. May I venture, although I have no official sources of information, to state my opinion that it is absolutely impossible that this line could ever be made without the consent of the British Government. It could not be made because the money is not forthcoming ; it could not be made because under existing political conditions a railway cannot be made through the British sphere in Persia without the consent of the British Govern ment. How, then, is a railway ever to reach the Indian border? I think that the idea that this railway must in any case be made, that we are, so to speak, on our knees and have to accept what is dictated to us by our rivals, is a mare’s nest for which there is not the slightest foundation. I would like to say this in conclusion. There have been two debates upon this matter, one in the House of Commons last week and this debate in the House of Lords. As I remarked in my former speech, not a single Member rose in the House of Commons to support the policy or the attitude of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and not a single noble Lord has risen in this House to-night to support the views or the policy of His Majesty’s Government. Perhaps that is not putting it quite fairly. Not a single Member has Earl Curzon of Kedleston. risen to express any opinion m favour of t construction of the line. I must dis- tinguish between the two, because Hi Majesty’s Government apparently re . pudiate any responsibility, though after listening carefully for an hour and more to the two speakers opposite I have not at this moment the ghost of an idea what their real attitude towards the railway is. There were moments in the speech of the noble Viscount when he alluded to the' cost of the railway, the profits, and so on, when he seemed to me to be, if I may saj so deferentially, a disciple in my own school; and yet when he talked of the future of the railway he seemed to contemplate its coming into being. The same mystery ran through the speech of the noble Marquess. He said it was not the intention to place any charge on Indian finances, that he was rather disposed to the old views as to Indian frontier policy; but, at the same time, he asked what more could they have done in the circumstances than what they did do. Whether that will relieve or confirm our apprehensions I cannot say, but this debate has left one very distinct impression on my mind, and that is that should the proceedings of this Societe d’Etudes take a concrete form, and should a scheme be brought before the Britisli Parliament, such a scheme will have very little chance indeed of ever being carried out. I believe you will find, as Lord Inchcape said, that India will be against it; I believe the bulk of public opinion in this country will be against it; and this debate to-night will not have been without its value if, whether His Majesty’s Govern ment agree with us or not, it has indicated to them the very strong feelings that are entertained upon the matter by some of us who have served in the East.

Sir I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the statutes and protocol of the societe d* etudes formed to undertake preliminary work in connexion with the proposed Trans Persian Railway. letter from Messrs. Baring Brothers and Company, Limited, on the subject. This letter which was shown unofficially to a member of your Department on the 2nd instant, was also communicated to the Board of Trade who expressed the opinion that the explanations which it contained as to the privileged position of the Russian group both in the societe itself and in the companies which might be formed during its existence in connexion v r ith the enterprise failed to show that British interests would be adequately safeguarded. I am to transmit to you herewith copy of a further It he Under Secretary of State India Office. 17 MAY 1912(19300/12) It was accordingly arranged tnat an informal conference snould take place between representatives of this Office, of tne hoard of Trade and of the British group to discuss the further modifications which it was desirable in the interests ox this country to introduce into the protocol. xhis conference was held on the 3rd instant and the suggestion was then made that tne difficulty which had arisen nii^nt oe sunnounted by depriving the additional shares to be assigned in future companies to the Russian group of the voting powers which they would naturally confer and thus equalising the position of the tiiree groups in the matter of control. A telegram was then sent to Viscount Errington, who had proceeded to Paris to represent the British group at a meeting with their French colleagues, directing him to explain the situation to them and I am to transmit to you herewith copy of a paper communicated by His Lordship to this Department on his return, embodying the results of their negotiations, on,which I am to invite the observations of the Marquess of Crewe.(19300/12) 1 dv-t: I siu uo state that, in bir E. Grey’s opinion, the preponderance assured to the Russian £&gt;roup in the present nnosihnh itself, provision xor the elimination of which is mane in tne sections numbered 1^ and 2^, has comparatively little importance as the societe is unlikely to exist for any great length of time. Sir E. Grey is therefore disposed to obstain from insisting on any modification of the statutes or protocol insofar as they affect this point. It is otherwise with the companies subsequently to be formed during the lifetime of the societe . which are dealt with in the section marked 3°. It will be observed that four alternative schemes are there suggested for the elimination of Russian preponderance while recognising the services rendered by the Russian group. Of these Sir E. Grey is disposed to prefer the first or the second while, as it appears from the Note dated May 6th, Messrs. Barin L , recommend those numbered 3°and 4°. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (t /2!47). 8, BISHOPSGATE, LONDON, E.G. 29th April, 1912. Sir:- Sociate Internationale d*Etudes du Chemin de fer Transpersan. With reference to our letter of the 25th instant. we now have the honour to reply to your letter of April 20th, No. 16297/12, having in the meantime had occasion to communicate with our French associates. In your letter under reply observations were made by Sir E.Grsy in regard to the provisions embodied in Articles 3 and 6 of the Protocole of this Societe. It may here be usefully explained that the ini tiative for this project having emanated from Russia, where a representative and active group had incurred considerable initial expenses and had done much useful work before approaching financial quarters in London and Paris, it was natural that some form ol indemni fication should be demanded by the Russian Group, and that this principle should be admitted oy both British and uis Mallet, Esq., C.B. Under Secretary of State Foreign Office.and French participants. While insisting therefore upon equality of re presentation and participation in the matter of effec tive control in the Societe d’Etudes, the British Group recognised the justice of the claims to consid eration put forward by the Russian Group, which, after prolonged negotiations, took the form embodied in Article 3. These conditions the British Group do not hold to be a remuneration out of fair proportion to the services rendered by the Russian Comite d'lnitia- s tive. The full purport of Article 6 not being establish ed to the satisfaction of the British Group, a meeting took place in Paris on April 22nd, when the stipula tions of this Article were fully discussed between members of the British and French Groups. It was then explained that the Russian claim to special recognition had originally consisted of a demand for 1(}£ of the net profits which the Societe d'Etudes might gain from presenting one or more con cessionary companies with the results of its studies and preparatory work; and that it was only after longand difficult negotiation that the pretensions of the Russian group were reduced to the remuneration now contemplated. As matters now stand the position of the Russian Comite d'Initiative is that on the forma tion of any subsidiary Company or Companies during the existence of the Societe d*Etudes .a transfer of 2/o of the nominal amount of the original share capital will he made to them by the British and French Groups. The capital required for the construction of so great a length of line as the Trans-Persian Railway would necessarily be raised by an issue of State- guaranteed Bonds, while share capital, in accordance with the practice which prevails in the financing of Russian Railways, will only be issued in a proportion limited to 1C^ of the funded capital. From this it will be seen that the advantages claimed by the Russian Comite d*Initiative are more reasonable than they appeared at firso sight, anc. that an effective check exists in the fact that it is to the interest of both British and French participants to curtail the existence ol the Societe d Etudes, as well as the amounts fixed for the original share capita.1capital of the Company or Companies to he created. On establishing the full purport of these stipu lations, the members of the British Group duly signi fied their adhesion to the terms of the Statutes and of the Protocole. We therefore venture to hope that on consideration of the explanations here given. Sir E.Grey will recog' nise that British interests are being protected by satisfactory safeguards. Me are &amp;c..

Homiakof has called to express to me keen disappointment caused to the members of original Russian consortium by the objection which.hejstated His Majesty’s Government had taken to the provisions of statutes of the Societe d’Etudes, which reserved to the consortium 12 per cent, of shares in the future concessionary companies. Consortium represent that the object of this arrangement is to secure to the original promoters of the scheme some voice in the future management. They would have none if the Russian, French, English financial groups concerned took each one- third shares. They point out that Russian shareholders can be always outvoted by French and English; there will be an equal number of directors of each nationality on the board. M. Homiakof gave me to understand that he had not approached Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject, so as to avoid giving incidentally too much importance, but that if the original promoters were to be excluded from all part in the enterprise much reseutment would be felt by those supporters of the Anglo-Russian entente who attached political importance to the railway scheme.

Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs is of opinion that loan should be made by Russian Bank at Tehran or by the Imperial Bank of Persia and bv the banks participating in the “ Societe d’Etudes ” of the Trans-Persian Railway scheme. Persian Uovernment should also be required to guarantee to these banks, in quite general terms, the concession for the construction of that railway. Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks, moreover, that so signal a service rendered to the Persian Government would justify England and Russia in stipulating for certain advantages which would ensure to them a favourable solution of certain long outstanding questions. To give an example, Minister for Foreign Affairs mentions among the questions which concern Russian interests (1) the right for Russian subjects to acquire real estate in Persia and to accept it as security for loans; (2) the improvement of the judicial procedure and of the execution of judicial decrees. I should be glad of your observations on these suggestions. Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs considers that the study of all the conditions of the loan might be entrusted to you and your Russian colleague, subject to the approval of the two Governments.

Sir: - Soclete Internationale d*Etudes du Chemin de Per Transperean* In the absence of Lord Revelstoke who left to- hay for the Continent, we have the honour to acknow ledge the receipt of your communication of March 25th relative to the scheme for the study of railway construction across Persia from the Russian frontier in a south easterly direction to a point on the frontier of Baluchistan and thence to Karachi. This scheme, as the Foreign Office is aware, has for its ultimate purpose the establishment of direct railway communication between Western Europe and India by the link which it is hoped to form between the British Indian and Russian Railv/ay systems. The discussions which have taken place in financial circles in Russia and prance, as well as in this country, have now resulted in the formation of an international body, to be styled the n Societe Inter nationale Louis Mallet, Esq., C.B., Under Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsInternationale d'Etudes du Chemin de Per Transpersan M It is proposed to hold the first meeting con stituting this Societe in Paris during the course of next month; in the meantime we venture to communi cate (in duplicate) for the information of the Foreign Office and India Office the text of the Statutes of the Societe together with the text of the supplement8-ry Protocole governing the relative proportions in which representation has been allotted to the Russian,British and French groups. On the-final nomination of the Administrators and on the actual constitution of the Societe we shall havg pleasure in conforming with the suggestion made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs t that a representative of the British Section of the Societe should be nominated to act as the medium for communication between the Foreign Office and the British, French and Russian groups of the Societe d*Etudes.

W e agree to Societe d’Etude taking up loan, but, on submission of their report as t° railway project, must reserve to ourselves complete freedom with regard to such questions as representation of Great Britain on board of directors of railway company, scale of freight and passenger rates to be adopted, alignment of railway, breadth and break of gauge, proportion of orders for construction to be. placed in this country, system of management, &amp;c., as to which we can only reach a conclusion after societe’s report has been received and examined. The mere fact that we have now agreed to the societe either taking up the loan or undertaking preliminary studies in connection with the railway must not be held to bind us in any way to adopt a particular attitude with regard to any of above or kindred questions, or even to construction of trans-Persian railway itself, unless agreement with regard to those questions is reached. . ^ think it important to make it clear that, in our view, flotation of loan, which is an immediate necessity, is. distinct from question of railway construction, and that former operation is only entrusted to societe from motives of expediency.

Note on certain of the Ports of the Mekran Coast and South-Eastern Persia through which the Trans-Persian Railway may be carried. In view of the facts that :— (1) The Indian Government desire the Trans-Persian Railway to approach India bi/ way of the Mekran Coast line ; and (2) At whatever 'point the railway first debouches on the sea board an important Port will probably spring up ; I decided that it would be advisable at once personally to inspect all the points on the Mekran and South-Eastern Persian littoral at which the railway might touch, and record the result of my investigation. I S. 150. Bliave accordingly just visited Pasni, Gwadar, Ghalibai, Jasv, am ; un Abbas by coasting steamer. 1 have also discussed local affairs m these parts with several local authorities, official and unofficial. Bunder Abbas is an open roadstead (steamers lie from two to three miles away from tbe shore) that offers no facilities 01 attiac tions o an} kind for the creation of an efficient harbour or seaport. At present goods are shipped and landed by large native sailing boats w 11 c i, or an hour or two at high water, are able to get alongside a diminutive and very old stone pier. In bad weather the sea, though not actually rough, is sufficiently disturbed to make shipping and landing very difhcu t at times, I 'believe, impossible. (As it is, goods are frequently lost between ship and shore). The construction of great breakvatem am piers, together with a regular course of dredging, would enable landing and shipping work from ocean-going steamers to be canied on moie quickly, but everything would be artificial. The spot ofters no natural advantages or attractions at the present day. On the contraiy the facts that (1) fresh w T ater is now very difficult to obtain, and \c) the climate during the hot months is so bad (a very moist heat with a high temperature and no sea breeze) as to drive an} Innopean and most of the native residents away, render Bunder Abbas an unsuitable spot at which to bring the drans-Persian Railway to the seaboard. The only point in Bunder Abbas’ favour at the present moment is that it is the nearest seaport to Kirman. At the same time, caravans take 25 to 35 days to travel between Bunder Abbas and Kirman, and goods are exposed to all weathers and to very rough handling. There can be no doubt that if Kirman were served by rail from some other point on the seaboard the caravan trade would quickly disappear, and with it the insignificant collection of dirty mud houses on the bench \ now called Bunder Abbas. A proposal has been made that the Trans-Persian Railway should debouch on the Persian Gulf at Bunder Abbas and thereafter follow the coast line to Karachi. Such a detour would, whilst depriving promising inland districts of the economic stimulus which the presence of railway always creates, add very materially to the cost and length of the trunk line to India. These disadvantages combined with lack of natural facilities and attractions at Bunder Abbas itself raise the question, Would it not be best to abandon Bunder Abbas altogether, and concentrate attention on some other point on the seaboard ? I am inclined to think it would. And for reasons which will appear a little later. Pasni .—‘‘An evil-smelling hamlet of Ichthyophagi ” ... so Major P. M. Sykes described Pasni in his Ten Thousand Miles in Persia. The description is correct. Lord Curzon in his “ Persia and the Persian Question ” calls Pasni an . . . &lt;£ excellent harbour.” This is more- than Pasni deserves. It is merely an open roadstead protected but very slightly, if at all, by a headland. It happens to be the point at which Alexander the Great is supposed to have struck the coast line. It is also known here a little because one of the land lines of the Indo- European Telegraph Company is watched at this point. The telegraph bungalow is the only substantial building in IVisni. Because the Government of India are anxious to encourage the growth of Pasni, in competition with Gwadur (which is recognised as belonging.to the Sultan of Muscat), arrangements have been made for the slow (fort nightly) Gulf mail steamer of the British India Steam Navigation Company to stop at Pasni. It is an extremely poor “ harbour,” however, and, being so close to Karachi has no likelihood of being converted into a modern port. Considered from the point of view of the railway, qua railway, the sooner the line strikes inland from the Indian Ocean the better. If, then,^ the Military Department of the Government of India will accept Pasni to Karachi as being a sufficiently lengthy and vulnerable stretchof coast railway, I would recommend that Pasni be made the first sea- (erminus of the 1 rans-Persian Railway. The advantages are (1.) A shortening of the trunk line as compared with an alignment touching the const lor the first time further westward. A greater prospect of greater local traffic from Kej-Mekran and the districts to the westward to Kasrkund. A sea terminus in British territory instead of in the Sultan of Muscat s or Persian territory. Ao necessity to attempt the construction of a modern port or harbour at a point so close to Karachi. (2.) (3.) (4.) The disadvantages of Pasni are : — (a) 1 he gieat cost of making a harbour if such be considered absolutely essential for political purposes. (6j The unhealthiness—at present—of the locality. (0 1 si a would have no seaport served by the railway unless a branch line ’were constructed. Assuming the militaiy authorities successfully establish the necessity of a longer length of line on ihe sea-coast, then the selection should in my opinion rest upon either Gwadur or Chahbar. Jask need not be considered. It is a tiny village and a telegraph station on a low lying shore from which steamers lie off some two miles, bubmaime cables and laud lines all unite at Jask. A wireless instal lation is also in use for communication with vessels of the Indian Marine engaged in the suppression of the arms traffic. There is but little trade, and were it not for the importance of the telegraph junction, Jask would never be heard of. I see no reason for the railway to touch Jask under any circumstances. Gwadur is an open roadstead—ships lie off two miles. The anchor age is fairly v r ell protected by a hammer-head shaped headland. Gwadur, which is moderately healthy, has the largest trade of any port on the Mekran coast. That it does not lend itself to harbour works except at great expense may not be an objection to it as the first sea- terminus of the Trans-Persian Railway. It is under the Sultan of Muscat. This may possibly prove a stumbling block. Chahbar Bay, so far as 1 can judge, affords by far the best natural advantages of any port on the Mekran Coast, if the creation of a new Jiort be taken into consideration. If a railway is to be carried across Persia from the north-west to the south-east, Persia will be able to adduce very good grounds why that railway should run to the coast line within Persian territory. There is absolutely no reason why the line, if it is to be a trunk line to India, should touch the coast at any point west of Chahbar Bay, and if the creation of a port be the inevitable consequence of the coming of the railways to the coast, and I think it is, then Chahbar affords the best natural advantages. Chahbar Bay is very large, with deep water all over it, and impres sive mountain ranges away to the north-west. The present telegraph buildings and village are on a little patch of rising ground at the south east corner, somewhat protected by a small headland and by a spit of sand running out in a west-south-westerly direction. Ships lie a mile- and-.a-half off the shore. Good fresh water is available, and the place seems quite healthy. Inside the bay, a little to the north-west of Chahbar village, is a bold headland stretching westward behind-which stood the old and famous port of Tiz. I did not get as far as Tiz, but I am iuclined to think that this is where harbour works, wharves and railway terminus would be located. The whole of the British fleet could easily find anchorage in Chahbar Bay, and although the entrance is some five miles b oacl, good shelter can be obtained from all winds and weathers, I believe. Summary .—The conclusions I come to are that: — (1.) If the British section of the Trans-Persian Railway could commence to climb to the higher inland tracts from Basni, andbe carried thence in the direction of Bampnr, it would be the best (a) for the railway, and (b) for Karachi Jioni a pinery commercial point of view. (2.) If the Military Department successfully insists upon a longer lead along tlie coastline, then the railway might well be canied inland from Gwadur. (3.) If the possibility of creating a good harbour and shipping and landing port be a paramount consideration, then Chahbar Bay affords the best natural advantages. Next in order of natural advantages conies Gwadur. (4.) If Persia demands, and is able to obtain, a railway terminus on her own south-eastern coast line, then Chahbar Bay is, in my opinion, the best spot for such a port and terminus. thought of serving Bunder Abbas should be put aside. Indeed, notwithstanding its past history, I would recommend the entire abandonment of Bunder Abbas, so far as the Trans- Persian Railway is concerned. Bam, Kerman, and the regions beyond would be well within 24 hours of the sea coast at Chahbar, as compared with 24-35 days by caravan at present. There is nothing whatever in Bunder Abbas to make it worth even a branch line to serve it. (5.) A possible alternative for consideration would be to carry the main line inland from Pasni, and construct (if Persia must have a port in her own territory) a small branch to Tiz in Chahbar on Chahbar Bay.

Cood fresh water is available and the place seems quite healthyhealthy. / yf Inside the hay, a little to the North-west of Chahhar village is a hold headland stretching westward ♦ behind which stood the old and famous port of Tiz. I did not get as far as liz, hut I am inclined to think that this is where harbour works, wharves and railway terminus would he loeated. The whole of the British fleet could easily find anchorage in Chahhar Bay, and although the entrance is some five miles broad, good shelter can be obtained from all winds and weathers, I believe. STTIIAPY :- The conclusions I come to, are that:- (1) If the British section of the Trans-Persian Pailway could commence to climb to the higher inland tracts from Pa snl, and be carried thence in the direction of Bampur, it would be the best (a) for the railway and (b) for Karachi from a purely commercial point of view. ( 2 ) If the Military Department successfully in sists upon a longer lead along the coast line then the railway might well be carried inland from Gwadur. (3) If the possibility of creating a good har bour and shipping and landing port be a paramount consideration, then Chahbar Bay af fords the best natural advantages. Next in ordert l&amp;f order of na-t-ural ddYant-es comes G-wadur. (4) If Persia demands and is able to obtain a railway terminus on her own soath-eastern coast-line then Chahbar Bay is in my opinion the test spot for such a port and terminus. All thought of serving Bunder Ahhas should he put aside. Indeed, notwithstanding its past history I would recommend the entire abandonment of Bunder Ahhas, so far as the Trans-Persian railway is concerned. Bam, Kerman and the regions heyond would he well within 24 hours of the sea coast at Chahhar as compared with 24/35 days hy caravan at present. There is nothing whatever in Bunder Ahhas to make it worth even a branch line to serve it. (5) A possible alternative for consideration would he to carry the main line inland from Pasni, and construct (if Persia must have a port in her own territory) a small branch to Tiz in Chahhar on Chahhar Bay.

My dear Sir Arthur, 8, Bishopsgate, London, March 5, 1912 ; PLEASE allow me to express to you my best thanks for the letter you were kind enough to write to me on the 2nd instant about the trans-Persian Eailway. Lord Revelstoke asks me to say how greatly obliged he is for the indications you have been good enough to give me of the Foreign Office attitude towards this project. These indications will be of the greatest value in affording some idea of the attitude it will be desirable to take when this matter assumes a definite shape. He notes that in so far as the interests of Great Britain, Russia, and France are concerned in the Societe d’Etudes, you have no objection to any percentage of distribution or^ repre sentation to which his approval is given, and hopes to arrange that such distribution and representation should be on an equal basis as far as these three countries are concerned. AMe have further noted that the British Government must be understood to reserve full freedom to action when it comes to the actual construction and subsequent manage ment, as well as the control of the lines which may be built. We also understand that the Foreign Office would wish to be consulted about the alignment, constitution of the board, representation of British interests, percentage of construction orders to be placed on the British market, as well as in general outline about the freight and passenger Lord Revelstoke greatly appreciates the suggestions you have so usefully made in regard to the nomination of Colonel Sir William Bisset and Mr. George^ Lloyd and he will endeavour to secure the services of these gentlemen on e consei d , administration,’ , as also of Colonel Napier on the “ comite de direction.

He remarked that it would be impossible for us to find a better syndicate, as the business was not a very tempting one. They would not, moreover, encourage participation of too much German capital. I pointed out that it might be more advantageous to treat the two questions as separate financial operations, as otherwise we might find that we had abandoned our freedom of action with regard to railway. His Excellency replied that it would be difficult for us to separate them altogether, ! as we must give syndicate reason to hope that railway project would be confided to them. I suggested that if we had this we should have to make it quite clear to them that we reserved to ourselves full liberty to approve or to veto railway project. So far two Governments had approved it only in principle, and it would be necessary to study very carefully recommendations which society might submit for its construction. His Excellency agreed, saying that we might tell them that they should have first option, subject to some such reserve as I had suggested. There would, lie added, be many questions for two Governments to consider before finally approving it, more especially that of its trace.CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

It has been noticed that statements have appeared in the English and Russian Press and have been telegraphed to India to the effect that the sea board of the Persian Gulf at Charbar or Bunder Abbas would be an appropriate point at which to locate a break of gauge in the proposed trunk railway from the Caucasus to Karachi. My Committee dissent from this view. They are strongly of opinion that the interests of British trade demand that the break of gauge (if such be un avoidable) should not be allowed to occur at any point south of the Russian sphere of influence as defined by a line drawn from Kasr-i-shirin to the north west corner of Afghanistan through Ispahan and Yezd.

With regard to Lord Ronaldsnay he sailed for India, he wrote that , the day 'before for certain reasons of a political nature which I need not mention ne. e, he considered it his duty to withdraw from the English Committee. I am of opinion, however, that in all pro bability, subsequent events will reassure his mind, cJid that on his return to England he may reconsider the tude he then took up. A word is perhaps necessary on the subject of the origin of the British Committee. Some months, ago Mr. A.G-oukassow, representative of the Russian Committee, after a conversation with Lora Ronalcisnay end the writer, urged the desirability of forming a repre sentative British Committee to work with the Russian Committee, and, if they found it possible, to pro mote the project, interesting themselves more parti cularly with the British side of the question. Fol lowing on this, the British Committee, as enumerated above, was formed. TheTh&gt;» Russian Comnii'b'bes had. approached Lord Revelsioke inviting him to join with the Russians in providing the cost of the preliminary surveys, the application for and negotiations in connection with obtaining the conces sion from the Persian Government. I understand that at first Lord Revelstoke was not prepared to take the mat ter up at all in its preliminary stages. Subsequently the Russian Committee approached certain French Finan ciers; in the first instance Monsieur Bardac. A group of French Financiers was thereupon formed who took the matter up with considerable enthusiasm, and as I under stand it, as a result of representations made by them to him. Lord Reyelstoke agreed to join the group. The Financial group to which I refer consists of twelve Russian Banks, six French Financial Houses, and Lord Revelstoke. The names of the Russian Banks I do not at this moment know, but if desired, they could easily be ascertained. The names of the French Financial Houses are as follows:- BanqueBanque de Paris. Credit Lyonnais. Bociete Generale. Cornpto ir D ’ Esc ornpte . Union Parlslenne. Messrs Bardac and Vital!. These Financ al Houses have formed themselves into a Societe d’Etude which, it is proposed should consist of twenty seven members, viz:- eight representing Rus sian Financiers, eight representing French Financiers, and eig;ht representing British Financiers, plus three members representing the Russian Committee. These twenty seven members will appoint a Council of seven, to whom the direction of affairs will be en trusted. Of the seven members two are to represent French interests, two Russian interests, two British interests, and one to represent the interests of the Russian Committee. I have been given to understand that Lord Revel- stoke has not agreed to the representation of the *? y- various interests in the proposition proposed by the Russian and French Financial Houses, maintaining that in his opinion, he would find it impossible to obtain thetns approval cf the Foreign Office to the proposed ar- rangenent, since the representatives of British inter ests in the Societe d'Etude and Council would be numeri cally inferior to those cf the Russian group. The Russian Committee, however, claim that they have a right to superior representation because (a) they ini tiated the project, and (b) because the Russian Govern ment have indicated their willingness to assist the financing of the construction cf the railway by agreeing tc jee jtw proposed new Railway '«-&gt;oriipsn,/ by a sub sidy in the form cf a rebate on the Russian railway system on all interchanged traffic (see page 3. 14 and 15, of the confidential memorandum enclosed with my letter of the 17th instant).

This Committee has I understand now been formally organized, and it is expected that the first call will be made on the members in a very short time now.

It is observed that whereas it has hitherto been the custom with writers on the question, official and public, to treat the line through Persia by itself, the real undertaking is to link up the Russian and Indian Railway systems, and the capital required for the complete project will, it is shown in the notes under the head Capital Cost, on the basis of the Russian Committee’s estimates, amount, not to 15 or 18 millions, as has been variously quoted for the Persian line by itself, but to upwards of 35 million pounds. This includes the cost of the two links connecting the projected Persian line with the Russian Railway system on the north at Aliat and with the Indian Railway system on the south at Karachi. In dealing with a project of such magnitude on the system under which a large proportion of the capital is to be provided by debenture loans it is necessary to take into account the 1TRANS-PERSIAN RAILWAY. ERRATUM. For Clause II., on page 3, substitute the following :— II. That it should be a condition that the construction of the Sections Aliat to Resht, and Karachi to Charbar, shall be proceeded with simultaneously and that southward from Resht and northward from Charbar the construction of the line shall be proceeded with pari passu.3 We may take it therefore that a condition of the support of the Indian Government will be:— I. That the scheme shall be complete, and embrace the entire length of line necessary to effect a junction between the Russian and Indian Railway systems at Aliat and Karachi respectively. II. That the construction of the Sections shall be proceeded with simultaneously and that southward from Resht and northward from Charbar the construction of the line shall suggested that conditional on the Russian Noth.—E xtract from Government of India Resolution, N. 105 R.P., dated 23rd June, 1910—Para. 2, clause (b) Rebate .—When the branch line connects with a railway owned and worked by the State, the Govern ment of India will be prepared to allow the company in respect of and at the end of each calendar year, by way of rebate, such a sum, not exceeding in any year the net earnings (exclusive of earnings derived from the carriage of revenue stores) from traffic interchanged between such State railway and the branch line as shall, together with the net earnings of the branch line, make up an amount equal to interest a.t the rate of 5 per cent, per annum on the actual expenditure charged to the capital account of the company. This undertaking will be subject to the proviso that, when the net earnings of the company, without the assistance of a rebate, suffice to pay interest at a rate exceeding 5 per cent., the surplus shall be divided equally between the Government and the Company. * * * The Bunder Abbas route, it is suggested, should be abandoned without awaiting further survey. If the line is kept for the length between Guattar and Karachi within striking distance of the sea, it would apparently Aliat to Resht, and Karachi to Charbar, be proceeded with pari passu and it is *Notk —For proposals lines formally agreeing to a similar course* to this effect already ° made by the Russian the Indian Government should agree to grant } mi f a on ^ r&gt; ,w a to this effect already made by the Russian Committee, see paetfl 14/15. a subsidy to the undertaking on the basis of the Indian “ Branch line term (vii.) :■4 sufficiently “ outflank not only all' political “ objections, but would satisfy those military “ objectors who can only see in a railway the “ opportunity for invasion of India” (Holdich), The further survey to be made should embrace the alternative alignment via the Kech Valley referred to on page 7. This would still leave a length of about 250 miles within reach of the sea. Fiom the Persian point of view there may be strong reasons for making the line throughout Persia of a separate gauge. If, however, it is decided to adhere to the proposal that the Northern portion should be of the Kussian gauge and the Southern of the Indian (broad) gauge then it would seem reasonable that the break should be at Anar, i.e., about half-way across | the neutral sphere. Failing this the break ! should be at Kerman, as already stipulated by / - the British Foreign Olfice, but from the j &gt; Persian point of view this may be taken exception to because of the inconvenience to local traffic. The main line is to be internationalized, and its management will accordingly fall to a joint board. This being agreed it would probably be convenient, and at the same time would soothe the susceptibilities of the Persian Government, if the arrangement adopted in the case of the Shanghai—Nankin Railway were followed in principle. In such a case the President of this Board would be a Persian, and Persia would have, in addition, at least one representative on the Board, which would otherwise be representative of the respective financial interests involved. 2, Queen Anne’s Gate, London, 22nd January, 1912.1.—ROUTE. The route which it was proposed the projected line should follow, as described in the Report issued by the Russian Committee in May last, is shown by a full red line on the sketch map attached, the total length of the line being:— In Russia. Yersts. Miles. Miles Aliat to Astara ... 195 129 129 In Persia. Russian sphere . Neutral „ British ,, Astara to Yezd Yezd to Kerman Kerman to frontier of ... 1,030 ... 329 683 218 Baluchistan ... 741 491 In Baluchistan ... 2,100 1,392 Frontier to Nushki ... 350 232 232 Total ... 1,753 The route to Nushki was, however, found too mountainous for the traffic contemplated, and partly for this reason and partly apparently on account of views expressed by the British h oreign Office, the line from Kerman was altered so as to make Karachi the point of junction with the Indian system instead of Nushki, the route followed being direct to Kair and Charbar and thence vi&amp; Guattar (on the Baluchistan Frontier), along the coast to Karachi. The effect was to increase the length of the through line by about 100 miles, or from 1,392 to 1,492 miles, and to also increase the length of the Baluchistan section from 232 to6 373 miles, making the total length of the line 1,994 miles, namely:— Uuasian sphere Neutral „ British In Russia as before In Persia— Astara to Yezd Yezd to Kerman ... Kerman to Guattar In Baluchistan— Guattar to Karachi Miles. Miles. 129 129 683 218 591 1,994 The British Foreign Office subsequently made it a condition of their support to the scheme that, subject to reconsideration as the result of actual survey, the line should enter the British sphere at Bunder Abbas instead of Kerman. The effect in point of mileage (assuming the route to be followed to be via Yezd), would be to increase the length of the Persian line to approximately 1,554 miles, and the mileage statement would stand as follows :— In Russia as before Miles. Miles. 129 Russian sphere . In Persia— Astara to Yezd ... 683 Neutral ,, Yezd to Bunder Abbas ... 425 British „ Bunder Abbas to Guattar 446 In Baluchistan— 1,554 Guattar to Karachi 373 A very grave objection to 2,056 this route from all points of view, except perhaps the strategic point, is that for over 800 miles (Bunder Abbas to Guattar and Guattar to Karachi) the railway runs along the coast line. It would for this great length be practically entirely dependent on the through traffic as very little local traffic could be looked for, and it would be of no avail whatever as a means of developing the agricultural, mineral and industrial resources of Persia.I The alternative route from Yezd to Charbar via Kerman (population 40,000), Bam (popu lation 6,000), and the populous plains of Narmashir and Regan, Bampur, and the Pan jgur district, appears to offer advantages which out weigh all comparison. The district is described as possessing a delightful climate for the greater part of the year, and generally a fair water suppiy. It i s moreover important that it should not be overlooked that one of the con- sequences that are bound to follow the opening up the country by a through line of railway is the development of enterprises for the construc tion of irrigation works wherever the valleys of the district afford scope for water storage. It is true that the Foreign Office proposals contemplate the construction of a branch line from Bunder Abbas or Charbar via Began and Bam to Kerman, The route Bunder Abbas to / Kerman may, however, be said to be impractic- / able, and the alternative, Charbar to Kerman, would involve the construction of an additional mileage of over 500 miles, which would not of itself be a paying investment, unless made as part of the through line. The conditions that the line should be within striking distance from the sea on the grounds of strategic considerations would appear to be very amply met by the fact that 1 the whole length from Charbar to Karachi on the route vi&amp; Kerman would be so situated. If this assumption is correct, the arguments in favour of the adoption of the route Yezd, Kerman, Charbar and Guattar, in preference to that from Yezd to Bunder Abbas, Charbar and Guattar, would appear to be overwhelming. It is advisable that the further surveys to be undertaken should include an alternative line south of Bampur via Serbaz, Turbat and the Kech Valley to Pas^i. This route would serve a large number of villages which would contribute to the traffic. n2.—GAUGE. Nothing is said in the Russian Committee’s report on the subject of the gauge ; but their proposals contemplated that the whole line up to the Baluchistan boundary should be of the Russian gauge (5 feet). The British Foreign Office have, however, stipulated that there shall be a break of gauge at Bunder Abbas, or wherever the line enters the British sphere of influence in Persia. This would mean at Bunder Abbas in the one case and at Kerman in the case of the alternative route. If there were no political or strategic points to be considered it would without doubt be preferable to make the break of gauge at Karachi, for this reason, that a line of the 5 feet (Kussian) gauge is somewhat cheaper than one of the 5 ft. 6 ins. (the Indian) gauge. From the traffic point of view, given that there must be a break, it is immaterial where it occurs. On the other grounds referred to it would seem that the point at which the break of gauge occurs should be half-way across the neutral zone, that is half-way between Yezd and Bunder Abbas in the one case or half-way between Yezd and Kerman in the other. But the interests of Persia have also to be considered, and it would appear that they would be within their rights in stipulating for a separate gauge within the limits of Persian territory. If they elected for the English gauge (4ft. SJin.) in use throughout Asia Minor, it would economize in cost of con struction, but would involve two breaks of gauge—one on the Eussian and one on the 39 t Baluchistan or Indian frontier. It must not be lost sight of however that the Baghdad Bail way, which, when the Teheran-Khanakin Bailway is made will form a junction with the Persian main line, is being constructed to 4 ft. 8|- ins. gauge. It would effect a still further and greater economy if the metre, or, preferably a 3 ft. 6 ins. gauge was adopted for the Persian line. Owing to the considerable distances involved a double break of gauge would not entail any inconvenience to passenger traffic. For example, through passengers to Pekin by the Siberian route change trains no less than five times. In the case of goods, through goods from England and the north of Europe would have to be transferred at the Bussian frontier on entering Bussia and again at the Persian and Baluchistan or Indian frontiers, making three instead of two breaks. In such a long journey the extra expense involved would not be a consideration of much impor tance. The chief objections are the risks of delay, possible damage in handling delicate goods, and pilfering, which could be obviated only by exceptionally good management. In the case of short distance goods traffic, say from Southern Bussia to Persia, a break of gauge at Astara would be an inconvenience, but the benefit Bussia will derive from the construction of the line being so great it would seem that they would hardly take exception to the condition if Persia stipulated for an independent gauge. Bussia has in fact so much to gain by the markets of Northern, Western and Central Persia being opened up to her commerce, and by the Indo-European passenger traffic being attracted to Bussia, that they would no doubt be prepared to meet other interests in return for the great advantages which Persia will confer by granting the concession for the construction of the line.10 3.—CAPITAL COST. The capital cost of the line through Persia is estimated by the Russian Committee at £19,125,000, including rolling stock. This was on the Nushki route and is at the rate of £13,739 per mile. This mileage rate and the estimate of the length of the different sections of the line appear to be on a liberal basis, but it is impossible to criticise the figures in the absence of anything but a super ficial reconnaisance of the country to be traversed. Including interest during con struction, the totalis increased to £*21,993,750, or £15,800 a mile, and assuming that about 90% of the capital is raised on 4% debentures at 85, it has been shown that the total capital to be raised to cover this expenditure, on which interest is payable, is £25,500,000, or £18,320 per mile. Noth.— There is an arithmetical error in the Russian Committee’s figures of 100,000 roubles, which would increase this total by about £13,000, but for convenience it is disregarded. For the route via Kerman to Char bar the amount to be borrowed would be increased on the basis of the average rate to 25,500,000 + 18,320 x 100 = £27,332,000 or say £27,345,000 allowing for the correction referred to in the foregoing note, and for the route via Yezd and Bunder Abbas it would be further increased to 27,345,000 + 18,3*20 x 62 = £28,480,840 or say £28,481,000. Note. — No allowance has herein been made for the difference in mileage cost due to increase of gauge in the one case from Kerman and in the other from Bunder Abbas. To arrive at the cost of the entire scheme allowance has to be made for the cost of the section in Russia from Aliat to Astara (129 miles), and for the cost of the line in Baluchi stan—Guattar to Karachi—(373 miles). For the former short length it may be assumed that the construction cost per mile would not exceed the Russian estimate for the section Astara to Resht, or £7,213 a mile, or allowing11 10 per cent, for rolling stock, and propor tionately for interest during construction, and discount on debentures 13,739 : 18,320 :: 7,213 + 721: 10,579—say, £10,600 a mile. For the coast line through Baluchistan, which would be of the Indian gauge (5ft. 6in.), allowing for the character of the line on a rocky coast with mountains coming in places down to the sea level, and the numerous spurs and cross drainage that would have to be dealt with, it would not be safe at this stage to estimate at a mileage rate much below that assumed for the rest of the line, or, say, £18,000 a mile. Persian section Russian section British section On this showing the entire cost of the undertaking, that is, the amount of the capital that would have to be raised to finance it, assuming that 90 per cent, of the amount is raised on 4 per cent, debentures at 85 net (including, of course, commission and under writing) would be Route via Route via Kerman.

In the case of the route via Kerman, British interests would be concerned to the extent of 52 per cent, of the total capital, of which approximately one-third would represent the cost of the unproductive coast line. In the other case the British portion aggregates 42 per cent, of the total, the whole of which would be represented by coast line with but little local traffic, and which would practically be entirely dependent on through goods and passenger traffic.12 4.—REVENUE ACCOUNT. There can be no question as to the Russian Committee’s estimate of through passenger traffic being very greatly overstated. It is shown that 116,255 private passengers, and 33,175 British soldiers passed through the Suez Canal in 1909, and on this basis it is assumed that 80,000 private passengers 33,030 troops 7,000 passengers for Persia 120,000 would use the line, and pay full through fares per annum. It is, of course, most improbable that the line would be used for the conveyance of British troops, and most unlikely that nearly 70 per cent, of the passengers via the Suez Canal, a large proportion of whom are for Ceylon, the Straits, China, and the Australian Colonies, would resort to the use of the line. But, on the other hand, the traffic in goods appears to be considerably underestimated, (for instance the through goods traffic includ ing bullion is estimated at only 36 tons per day) and, if the returns on the Trans-Siberian line may be taken as a criterion, it does not seem that the mileage estimate of R. 11,065 per verst, can be regarded in the aggregate as excessive. It is made up of :— Passengers and luggage Goods* Other receipts, including mails R. 5,302 4,616 1,147 &gt; per verst. R. 11,065 * Includes local passengers. The actual receipts on the Trans-Siberian line (3,141 versts) in 1908 were :— R. \ Passengers 1,952 Goods 9,634 Other receipts 371 11,957 , per verst. It may be noted that the Revenue Estimate shows a net credit of £81,780 on account of the lease to the Russian Railways of the13 through passenger cars. This would seem to be an error if, as it is elsewhere assumed, the cars are leased at cost price only without allowance for profit (vide page 9,14—footnote). Without any correction on this account the Revenue account, taking the line through Persia by itself, shows a net credit of £735,698, against which are to be set:— 1. The interest charges on share capital at 6 per cent. 2. The interest and sinking fund charges on Debenture capital at 4 22 per cent., assuming 75 years as the duration of the concession, and that the sinking fund is invested at 4 per cent. The capital involved being, say— Kerman Bunder Abbas Route.

It would obviously not be reasonable to make the finances of the whole undertaking depend on a subsidy in the shape of a rebate on the charges for traffic passing over the Russian Railways only. Indeed, this is not apparently contemplated, for it is said half the line is expected to be guaranteed by Russian capitalists. We are assured that there is no prospect of either the British or the Indian Government entering into a financial guarantee, but it seems urgently necessary that some announcement should be made in£ 14 connection with the finances as to the willing- ' ness or otherwise of the Indian lines to con tribute on the basis of the Indian Railway branch line terms. Something has been said about the grant of a subsidy by the British Government for the carriage of the mails. The present subsidy paid to the P. and O. Company covers the entire cost of the transport of the mails, and in the 'Revenue Estimates of the proposed under taking credit is taken for their transport by rail as an item of traffic. It does not appear that it could be expected that a mail subsidy in addition to the charge for transport would be granted. On the basis that the gross receipts would aggregate R. 11,065 per verst throughout, except on the coast sections, where they may be taken at R. 10,315 per verst (R. 1,000 per verst being the full estimate of the receipts from local goods and passengers, the receipts on the coast line under this head are taken at R. 250 per verst only), and that the working expenses would amount to 70 per cent, of the gross receipts, the net receipts from the complete undertaking would amount to :— Kerman Route via Route. Bunder Abbas. Length 1,994 miles. 2,056 miles. Capital Cost ... £35,426,000 £36,562,000 £ £ Gross Receipts 3,491,510 3,547,216 Working Expenses ... 2,444,057 2,483,051 Ket Receipts £1,047,453 £1,064,165 Interest at 6 % on Share capital (10^) and Interest and Sinking Fund at 4‘2 2% on Debenture capital ... 1,557,277 1,607,886 Annual deficit £509,824 £543,721 Say £510,000 £544,000 These deficits, in either ease, would be amply covered by the joint subsidies, if fixed as suggested at those allowable under Indian Branch Railway terms, namely, to the net earnings of interchanged traffic, on Russian and Indian Railways respectively.The &gt;tiL Q l r t C l£ , Mes f&gt; rs G-o u Iza ss ow, Ho m i a kcff, a nd Y- Zveguintzow, representing the Russian Committee interested in the promotion of the 'Trans-Persian Railway, called yesterday in accordance with arrangements made by Sir A.

The choice of direction for the line intended to connect the system of Russian railways with that of British India has been determined by considerations for establishing the shortest railway route between Europe and India, which should at the same time further the development of the trade of Russia and British India respectively with Persia, and supply the needs of the latter m her local trade and industry. With these objects in view the route in Persian territory is pi ejected to start at Astara, on the Russian frontier, and to reach the boundaries of British possessions via Resht, Kaswin, Tehran, Kashan, Earn, Test, Rinnan, Bam, Gehan, and across Persian Baluchistan. The length of the route in Persia will be about -2,100 versts, the last stretch of 700 versts including a detour to avoid the deserts of Desht and Loot, which result in an increase of the length by 200 versts. 'Jbjj Jl^OO The distance from the frontier of Baluchistan to the Kushki station on the India North-Western Railway is about 350 versts, and from the latter point Bombay 1,737 versts. The sources of income of the future Indian route in Persian territory will be as follows :— (A) Transit of passengers and goods from Europe to India and mce- versa (see “ Earnings of Russian Railways ). ( B ) Goods traffic in connection with the trade between Persia and neighbouring districts of Russia and British Baluchistan. (c) Local passenger and goods traffic. (n) Use of Persian passenger cars by Russian railways. Estimates of income from the transit are based on the figures supplied for ssengers and goods in the notes on earnings of Russian railways. The takings from passenger traffic are estimated at following rates Express trains, first class =6 copecks per verst. Express trains, second class = 5 copecks pel veist. ,• 1 (In round figures, R. 125 and R, 105 respectively for the entue .) Fast passenger trains, second class = 4 copecks per verst. Fast passenger trains, third class = 3 copecks per verst. t. . , , 7 nnn ....ssengers going from Europe to Persia and back It is assumed that 7,000 passenger traTelling se cond class in fast II accomplish in Persia only half the ] 3 ssenger trains. The income from carrying luggage and quick dls P at ^ ^ 0 ^ ^ome from the rates charged per pood per of the income rrying mails is estimated proportionately to distances on i rived under the same head by Russian lines.The volume of import and export trade of Russia and India with Persia as computed on the statistics supplied in Consular Reports, Customs Returns etc., aggregates to 21,537,200 poods (see Schedule No. 2), with an average verstage of 463 versts. The income from.goods traffic is estimated for each class of merchandise separately on the basis of rates charged by Russian railways, and the estimates are made up for runs from frontier points to Persian stations of destination for goods imported from Russia and India, and from stations of origin to frontier points for goods exported from Persia to those two countries. The goods verstage averages 463 versts, the rate per pood per verst amounting to 1-16 copeck or to 28.89 copecks per pood for 463 versts of average verstage. As can be seen from the schedule annexed, it is owing to the nature of the goods carried, and to the comparatively small verstage, that the pood rate for a carriage over a distance of 463 versts, is nevertheless not high when compared with the cost of caravan transportation (by pack horses, mules, asses, camels, etc.), not to speak of the deterioration of goods from exposure and protracted journey unavoidable in this case. According to Colonel Medvedieff (“ Persia,” p. 241) the cost of carriage varies with the value of the goods, their susceptibility of being made up into packs, the state of the market, and the number of beasts required. For instance, the charge made for carrying one harvar (about 19 poods) by mule from Meshed to Kirman, a distance of 924 versts, over a well-frequented caravan road, is 10 to 12 tomans (about R. 20 to R. 24) in the summer, and R. 30 to R. 36 in the winter, averaging R. 1.45 per pood. I he tianspoi tation of 1 harvar by donkey costs, in the summer, from R. 16 to R. 20 , in the winter R. 24 to R. 30, or on an average R. 1.18 per pood, and by camel R. 10 to R. 12 in the summer and R, 18 to R, 20 in the winter, averaoino- 79 copecks per pood. Thus the average cost of carriage by beasts of burden over a distance of ' “ versts 18 J 14 , which for the average verstage of 463 versts of rail transporta tion amounts to 57 copecks per pood ; or, in other words, it is twice as much as the estimated cost of rail carriage. «■' — , i— ^ ieie aie 110 data for determining the extent of the passenger traffic between Persia and the bordering countries, and as it cannot be of importance, it not been taken into account at all. p . am Some ^ e § ree a Pproximation the probable income of the future : ersian Railway from local passenger traffic is estimated on the basis of the income ccoi in^, to leturns of the State control for 1908) of the least frequented Russian railways of the time from carrying full-rate passengers (i.e., with the exclusion of ice or reduced fares, soldiers and officers of the Army, etc., and of luggage), m he i f erm Eailway ’ R - 528 -95; the Central Asian Railway, R. 1,086.77; 'd the ^ashkent Railway (opened to traffic in 1906), R. 822.08. These give an LT 86 ? Per V6rSt per anmim ’ which fi g«re is adopted as the probable income of the future Persian Railway. xi °thin &amp; like an extensive local goods traffic can be expected, especially in Hi ^ Perl0d of the working of the railway, between the populated points on silnafprl i P°fi ua lc * n 18 rstributed unevenly, the inhabited places forming oas&lt; in hetwc n i/n llp 0 aiU which ’ s on| y about 30 versts in breadth, and is hemm on ! ranges or salt deserts. The local industries are carried on exclusiv, to the ml nA' t SCa e c ’ nd w dhout the assistance of any machinery, are limit manufacture of felts, carpets, cheap woollens, silks, and earthenware. chieflv l,,.- '“T 0 ( countr y ' n m achine-manufactured goods are suppli chiefly by .mports from Europe. For these reasons the local goods traffic9 estimated to produce only the insignificant amount of E. 200 per verst. In the aggregate the income of the Persian Railway from the local passenger and goods traffic may be estimated in round figures, E. 1,000 per verst. Assuming for goods an average verstage of 200 versts and freight rate of U o copeck per pood per verst, we shall obtain as the average cost of carriage 10 copecks per pood, and as the volume of the expected goods traffic, 200 x 2,100 x 100 = 4,200,000 poods. The volume of the goods traffic will be so insignificant only in the earlier period of the exploitation. It is proposed that the passenger and dining cars and luggage vans required for Russian lines for the projected through train service shall be paid for out of the construction capital of the Persian Railway, and the latter shall receive 30 copecks per train verst for cost of depreciation, maintenance, repairs, heating, lighting, etc. The income from this source is estimated R. 1,462,920 for 4,876,400 train versts (see Schedule No. 1). Based on the foregoing estimates of income from passenger and goods traffic, the working of the Persian Railway must be organised on the following considerations :— The number of train-versts for express and fast passenger trains will be 2 X 2 X 365 x 2,100 = 3,066,000 train-versts. The goods traffic in connection with the trade of Persia with Russia and British India will require 9,964,571,000 pood-versts (Schedule No. 2), the verstage being 463 versts per pood. The transit goods traffic is not taken here into account. The trains will not carry the full complement of cars on the entire verstage of 463 versts : in the case of export beginning from the stations remotest from the frontiers the number of cars will gradually increase through the coupling on of loaded cars; in the case of import the number will decrease through dropping off of cars for unloading. Therefore, to be on the safe side, and nearer the actual position of the matter, the train-load is not taken to amount to 15,000 to 20,000 poods, which corresponds to a train made up of thirty-five loaded cars, each carrying 450 to 600 poods (the load limit being 900 poods), but only to 10,000 poods, which will correspond to a train of thirty-five cars with a load of 300 poods pei cai, oi to a train of seventeen to twenty-two cars, with a load of 450 to 600 poods per car. On this assumption the number of train-versts for the goods traffic in con nection with the import and export trades with Russia and British India will be 9,964,571,000 10,000 996,457. These trains having a short verstage of 463 versts, will serve for the traffic only on the end sections of the Persian line. Therefore, to comply with the local needs on the entire length of the line it is proposed to run a mixed passengei and goods through train, with an annual run of 2 x 2,100 X 365 = 1,533,000 tiain-versts This train will serve also for the railway’s owm needs. T o sum up, the aggregate number of train-versts required will be as follows . (1.) Express and fast passenger trains... (2.) Goods trains for the trade with Russia and India 3,066,000 996,457 (3.) Local mixed goods and passenger through trains 1,533,000 Total ... 5,596,457 or, in round figures, 5,600,000 train-versts.In accordance with the work required from the railway, the working expenses will be as follows:— Expenses affected little or not at all by the traffic, namely, maintenance of the Board and central management and principal local branches of the latter on the line; maintenance and repairs of the permanent way, superstructures and buildings are estimated R. 4,000 per verst; this figure is based on the expenditure under the same heads of the Tashkent and Central Asian Railways, which present many points of similarity with the proposed Persian line. According to the returns of the State control, expenses under those heads for 1908 amounted to R. 4,104.69 for the Tashkent Railway, and to R. 3,489.26 for the Central Asian Railway. Expenses affected by the traffic: those incurred in the working of the trains and in the maintenance and upkeep of the rolling-stock and appliances (the guards and locomotive staff, goods agents, loading, fuel for locomotives, heating and lighting of cars, repairs and upkeep of rolling-stock), are estimated R. 1.20 per train-verst, on the basis of the average corresponding expenditure of the Trans caucasian Railway, R. 1.35 ; the Central Asian Railway, R. 1.05 ; and the Tashkent Railw'ay, R. 1.12 (see returns of the State control for 1908). Although the greater portion of the proposed Persian Railway is to pass through localities inhabited by Persian natives, who are of a sedentary and peaceful character, nevertheless, in places, and chiefly in Southern Persia, the road passing through districts inhabited by nomadic tribes, there will be a need of an armed guard. This will be required altogether for about one-third of the entire length of the road, or 800 versts. The expenditure for the maintenance of the guard is estimated at about R. 500,000, on the basis of the expenditure incurred for a similar purpose by the Vladikavkaz Railway. The foregoing data and considerations are intended only to supply means for estimating the probable income of the proposed Persian Railway, and they relate only to a trunk line. No account is taken of possibilities presented by such branch lines as one to Enseli on the Caspian coast, about 38 versts long, and another one to Ispahan of about 135 versts, which, there can be no doubt, will soon be found necessary, and, if built, will result in a considerable increase of traffic. As can be seen from theEchedule No. 1, the net income of the Persian Railway is estimated at R. 6,924,320 /which represents R. 3,297 per verst, or R. 1.24 per train-verst.ESTIMATED INCOME OF RUSSIAN RAILWAYS FROM THE PASSENGER, MAIL AND QUICK=DISPATCH=GOODS TRAFFIC BETWEEN THE WEST OF EUROPE AND INDIA. The establishment of direct railway communication between the West of Europe and India, via Persia, is undoubtedly of world-wide importance. The question as to what may be the extent of the passenger and inter national goods traffic by the proposed route can be answered to the full only after a thorough and detailed study of existing conditions of traffic between Europe, Persia, and India, and of possibilities of its future development with the expected growth of industry and requirements of the population. The fact that this traffic will be traversing Eussia over a distance of 3,340 versts, and is certain to become a source of considerable additional revenue for Russian railways, is of especial significance. The approximate estimate of this revenue forms the subject of the present memorandum. The trade between Europe and India is very large. According to returns for 1909, imports to India were valued at 1:63,000,000, while exports reached £54,000,000. Although official statistics of the Indian trade, as given in the Board of Trade Returns for 1909, are very elaborate, it is difficult to determine what proportion of imports and exports is likely to go by direct transit through Russia. The distance between the extreme points of railway communication are as follows:— Calais to Russian frontier (Skalmerschitsi) ... Skalmerschitsi to Persian frontier (Astara) ... Astara to Baluchistan frontier ... ' Baluchistan frontier to Bombay 1,135 versts 3,341 • 2,100 2,087 Total 8,663 versts.* per verst, the cost of transportation versts.Bremen at Colombo. More time would be required if the steamer finds it necessary to call at intermediate ports on the route. Hence it is more than doubtful that any important quantities of low-priced goods will be diverted to the proposed railway route for transport by slow trains. It is certain, however, that goods of a comparatively higher value can be diverted for transportation overland by the Anglo-Indian route, but on the condition of quick delivery by passenger trains. It is impossible to determine exactly the quantity of such goods, as the Board of Trade Returns are made up in various units of price, in cwts., lbs., gallons, yards, and pieces. Only valuable goods of over R. 40 per pood have been taken into consideration. The quantity is fixed conditionally, and only such goods have been considered which could be reduced to weight and represented in poods. (Schedule Ko. 3.) The imports from England, France, Germany, Austria, and Belgium to India consist of chemicals (quinine), glassware, and beads, clothes, ribbons, hats, handkerchiefs, silk thread and stuffs, gold and silver thread, umbrellas, carpets, wool stuffs and hosiery; electrical, optical, musical, photographic, and surgical instruments ; works of art, cycles, clocks, perfumery, typographical appliances, etc., making up in all about 950,000 poods. For purposes of estimating the income it is assumed that only 1,000 poods of goods will be carried daily, or 365,000 poods per annum. Of the more valuable goods exported from India to England and to other parts of the Continent may be mentioned indigo, kerchiefs, and shawls, sifars, rugs, and carpets, furs and skins, etc. Although the average value of exports is lower than that of imports, it may be assumed, however, that the more costly class of goods for certain considerations will be conveyed by rail. But to be on the safe side, only a certain percentage, and not the entire quantity, of these goods, according to their kind, is taken into account. (See Schedule No. 3.) They aggregate to 440,000 poods; for estimating- purposes, however, only 1,000 poods per diem, or 365,000 poods per annum, is taken into account. gold and 95,921 poods of silver; and the exports therefrom, 2,177 poods of gold and 450 poods of silver. The whole turnover consisted of about 100,715 poods. Accoiding to the tiade returns of British India for the last five years, from 1905 to 1909, the average annual irrmnrts intn inriio o -ic? 1 p — J ■ 1 verstComing now to the question of the conveyance of passengers, it is quite evident that the saving of time and considerably cheaper fares will induce them to travel by rail. The voyage from London to Bombay (by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, see list of sailings for 1910) occupies twenty-two days, and the combined trip, partly by rail and partly by steamer (via Marseilles), fifteen days. By rail the time required for the journey will be seven and a-half days by express, and nine and a-half days by fast train. The saving in time as against the sea voyage will be fifteen and a-half days for express train, single journey, and twenty-nine days for the return journey ; in comparison with the combined sea and railway journey, the saving will be six and a-half days and thirteen days respectively. The minimum cost of the combined rail and sea voyage, inclusive of victualling, is : First class, B. 463; second class, B. 342; third class, B. 214. For the journey there and back the single fare is increased by 50 per cent. Therefore the limit for the railway fare, including the cost from London to Calais, should not exceed half of the cost of the double sea voyage, or B. 333, B. 246, and B. 153. Based upon these considerations, and taking into account existing passenger rates, we obtain the following fares for the journey first and second class by express trains, and third class by fast trains :— Distance Versts. Terminal Station. Fares in Roubles. Fares from London to Calais. Total Fares. 1315 3341 2105 Calais—Skalmerschitsi ... Skalmerschitsi—Astara...

(Schedule No. 5.) As not all these passengers proceed to India, the number for the overland route can be taken as 80,000 ordinary passengeis and 33,000 mi i ary , ^ number must be added, say, about 7,000 persons pioceeding tv) am 10 m For computing the revenue for Russian railways, the numbei of throu^t passengers is assumed only at 120 , 000 . These passengers, to the number of 330 per day, travelling m both directions could be conveyed in two pairs of trains; in the beginning one P air ^ ^ t chss at a speed of 50 versts, each train being made up of one dining-car, o cars, one second-class car, and one composite mail an u b 0 a &amp; e pair, run at a speed of 40 versts per hour, would consist as to each t-m of one second-class and one third-class cars, one luggage van, and one oi wo b type of luggage van for quick-dispatch goods. ; The following number of passengers was conveyed through.r 14 The number of seats in the trains would be as follows:—160 first class, 112 second class, 300 third class; total, 572 seats in each direction. With a fairly regular distribution of the passenger traffic, the trains would be filled to the extent of 58 per cent, of their seating capacity. In reality, however, owing to the irregularities of the traffic, the number of passengers in any train may exceed this percentage considerably. (Schedule No. 6 .) In view of the length of the journey, an additional J pood of luggage over the usual free allowance is reckoned upon making a total of 60,000 poods per annum. The following passenger fares are proposed :— ( 1 .) For express trains, with a dining-car, same as on the Siberian express for distances from 3,291 to 3,360 versts. (2.) For passenger trains, with a speed of 40 versts, same fares as per ordinary differential zone passenger tariff. For luggage, the charges to correspond to the zone tariff on Eussian railways, for distance of 2,240 versts, i.e., 126.75 copecks for 10 lb., or E. 5.07 per pood. It is proposed to make up the trains exclusively of cars of the Persian Eailway, and work them with the engines of the transit lines. The Persian railways are to receive from the transit lines revenue 30 copecks per train-verst, which corresponds to the amount received by the Vladikavkaz Eailway from other lines for the use of their cars of the fast Black Sea trains.* The earnings from carrying mails, estimated (Schedule No. 7) on the basis of the earnings of the Chinese Eastern Eailway, will amount to E. 1,500,000 per annum. The total net income (see Schedule No. 8 ) derived by Eussian railways from the passenger and goods traffic is estimated to amount to E. 4,400,000. The realisation of this additional revenue depends upon the building of the proposed Persian line, forming the connecting link between Europe and India, this line will be 2,100 versts long, and would require a considerable construction capital. Half the line is expected tobe guaranteed by Eussian capitalists, and the y additional net income of E. 4,400,000accruing to the Eussian railway system might at any rate help to cover the deficits of the Persian line, unavoidable at the commencement of the exploitation. * The Suez Canal during 1 the last five years :— In 1905 „ 1906 252.691 ' 353,881 „ 1907 „ 1908 „ 1909 243,826 218,967 213,122 - or an average 256,498 per annum. f Depreciation on the cost of cars Maintenance and repairs of cars Lighting of cars Heating „ Supply of linen ,, furniture covering Repair and washing of linen Wages of drivers and firemen Fitting out buffet and kitchen ... 5,600 cop. 12,076 „ 1,100 „ 0,620 „ 1,930 „ 0,350 „ 2,070 „ 4.960 „ 0,400 „FINANCIAL RESULTS. For establishing direct railway communication between the West of Europe Russia and India, in the direction on which are based the foregoing preliminary estimates of the paying capacity of the proposed route, it will be necessary (a) To reinforce Russian Railways with additional engines, certain structures and appliances. (b) To lay a third track between the stations Baladjari and Aliat on the Trans-Caucasian Railway for a distance of 64 versts. (c) To build the railway Aliat-Astara in Russian territory of a length of 195 versts. (d) To build a Persian trunk line of a length of 2,100 versts. (e) To build a branch line of 350 versts from the frontier of Baluchistan to the station Noushki of the North-West Indian Railway. (f) To substitute for the narrow gauge line Hyderabad-Marvar and Sabermati, 849 versts long, with the proposed broad-gauge Hyderabad- Sabermati line, 525 versts long. The work enumerated under (a), (b) and (c) should be carried out by the Russian State or by private enterprise of Russian Railways interested in the scheme, and the work under (d) and (e) should be carried out by British-Indian enterprise. For the building of a Persian trunk line from Astara to the frontier of British Baluchistan, a new private company will have to be formed. The cost of construction of a railway and the acquisition of rolling stock for the proposed line, and also for the through trains running between the Russo-German frontier and the frontier of Persia and British-Baluchistan over a distance of 3,340 -f- 2,100 = 5,440 versts, according to the investigations made by the Engineer, W.

According to the estimate of income and expenditure (Schedule No. 1 ), the net income of the Persian Railway is expected to amount to R. 6,924,328, or, in round figures, R. 7,000,000'per annum. It can be seen from the comparison of these figures that, at least in the earlier period of its existence, the Persian line will be unable to pay out of its own income the entire cost of its capital. For paying off the interests on the debenture capital there will be a shortage of about R. 2,000,000 (1,936,000). In addition, interest must be secured on the share capital of R. 16,000,000. At the rate of 6 per cent, this item of expenditure will amount to R. 3,000,000 (2,896,000). The building of this railway, forming, as it will do, a connecting link in the world’s railway system, will result in a considerable increase of the income of existing lines forming part of the proposed route, owing to additional passenger ^ goods traffic. The increase for Russian Railways alone is estimated at R. 4,40( The Russian lines could use this sum, at least partly, for assistance to the Persian Railway. On the other hand, it cannot but be admitted that the building of the proposed railway will be of enormous importance to the government interests of India, dhere is, tnerefore, justification for the belief that the Indian Government will also participate in guaranteeing the payments in respect of the capital of the Persian Railway, and thereby help in the realisation of this world-wide undertaking which is oi so gi eat importance to India. Lastly, postal conventions for carrying mails with Governments interested in the establishment of frequent and quick postal service to India and countries further East will prove a source of definite income for the proposed transit line.

SCHEDULE No. 7. To fix the revenue for carrying of the transit Mail the following data can be made use of:— 1 . —For the present, and until the next Assembly of the Postal Union, the international transit Mail is carried by the Chinese Eastern Railway, on condition that a rate of 5 francs per kilogramme for letters and 70 centimes per kilogramme for parcels be levied on that line. One kilogramme equals 2.44 lbs. (Russian), hence the transmission of 1 lb. of letters on the Chinese Eastern Railway will amount to 187.50-^2.44 = 76.80 copecks; and the transmission of 1 pood of letters would therefore be 76.80 x 40 = R. 30.72. The length of the Chinese Eastern Railway is 1,388 versts, and thus their earnings, derived from the transmission of letters on that line, equals 2.2 copecks per verst. The distance from the frontier of Russia and Germany to the frontier of Russia and Persia equals 3,340 versts. Hence the earnings on this journey would amount to R. 73.48 per pood of letters. 2 . —Taking into consideration that the Chinese Eastern Railway receives 70 centimes for the transmission of parcels, and applying the present mode of reckoning, one can assume that the section of the Russian Railways will receive R. 10.28 per pood of parcels. According to the returns of the representatives of the Post and Telegraph Departments, regarding the carrying of the Mail along the Chinese Eastern Railway, as considered at their special conference on the 19th September, 1908, the present quantity of Mail dispatched daily from the West of Europe to China, Japan and Korea, and vice versa, is fixed at 60 poods per day. liom the 56th annual returns of the Post Office Department of Great Britain foi 1910 it will be seen that the Mail carried during the official year 1909-10 from England to India and Australia and back amounted to 205,000 poods, of which 24,605 poods weie sealed and open letters, and 180,395 poods were composed of parcels, catalogues, books, newspapers and samples. applying the above calculations to the whole, of this quantity of Anglo- ndian and Australian Mail, the gross revenue of the Russian section of the railway for carrying of the Mail would amount to R, 3,662,435, and that of the Persian Railways to about R. 2,236.000 ^ Besides India, Ceylon and Australia, it should be borne in mind that there are wnnid C ° U !f ™k! a, P ° St , COnneotions &gt; Sllch asthe French and Indo-Chinese, which would undoubtedly use the overland route to Calcutta. With regard to the amount of revenue which the railway can reckon on from le canying of the Mail, this depends upon the conditions laid down at the time by 1 ' 1 °' Wlth res P«=tive interested countries. At any rate, there can be doubt that the possibility of a daily dispatch and delivery of letters, combined with the enormous gain in time, will without fail cause letters, newspapers, and other kinds of correspondence to be sent by the overland route.

As regards the former I am to say that the Secretary of State for India sees no objection on its merits to the alternative alignment Yezd-Furg- Ramxshk-Chahbar proposed by the Government of India as a compromise Ihere appears, however, to be good reason to believe that the alignment which they ongmally proposed, entering the British sphere at Bunder Abbas is not open to the objections taken to it by the Russian promoters ; and in view of this fact, and of the further considerations that it is desirable (1) that the port (which might eventually pass into hostile hands) should lie within the Gulf rather than outside it ; (2) that the railway should be so situated that His Majesty’s Government can protect their section of it without the risk of entanglements in the interior of Persia, the Marquess of Crewe is of opinion that the alignment via Bunder Abbas shculd be insisted upon as an essential condition. In this connection it will eventually be necessary to consider what conditions should be laid down to insure that Bunder Abbas is a predominantly British, and not an international, port. As regards the question of a guarantee, it would appear from vour letter of bth February, No. 3668, that a joint Societe d’Ftudes is being formed without the assistance of either Government. The suggestion made in paragraph 4 of the Government of India’s letter need not therefore be further considered. On the more important question referred to in paragraph f&gt;, I am to say that his Lordship concurs in the opinion of the Board of Trade, expressed in Sir H. Llewellyn Smith’s letter of 21st September last, that it does not “ appear possible for any sufficient case in favour of the proposed line to be made out to enable a Government guarantee to be defended on a purely “ commercial basis.” He further agrees with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury that, from the commercial and financial point of view, “ the “ proposal ” [to offer a direct guarantee] “ does not appear to be one which His Majesty’s Government can take into serious consideration.” While, therefore, his Lordship is not prepared to say that in no circum stances could he recommend such assistance as that suggested by the Government of India for the sanction of his Council, he prefers to await the results arrived at by the Societe d’Etudes before giving a final decision. It is observed that, in the memorandum forming an enclosure in Sir E. Grey’s Despatch No. 324, dated 12th December last, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg, a contract with His Majesty’s Government The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 138.for the carriage of the Indian, Australian, and New Zealand mails is men tioned as one of the main objects of the Societe d’Etudes. Formal proposals on this point will no doubt be made in due course, but I am to remark that the question of transferring such a valuable asset from the British Mercantile Marine to an international railway would seem to raise large issues which wil] doubtless receive special consideration.

The Most Hoh’ble the MARQUIS of CREWE, K.G., Ris Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. ( * My Loud Marquis, Calcutta, the 21st December 1911. We have had under consideration Your Lordship’s letter No 24 (Secret), dated the 18th August 1911, in which you ask for our opinion* on certain points connected with the proposed Trans-Persian Railway. 2* Id reply, we have the honour to enclose a copy of a report by a Committee which has examined the various aspects of the question. The conclusions of the Committee are : {a) that, both on military and commercial grounds, any proposal to bring the railway through Kerman, or via Yezd-Kerman- Charbar, should be resisted; (5) that, although the best alignment, in British and Indian interests, would be that via Yezd-Bandar Abbas, the alignment via Yezd- Purg-Ramiskh-Charbar presents less objection than the align ment via Yezd-Kerman-Charhar, and may be recommended as a possible basis of compromise; (c) that a British contribution should he made to the expenses of the Societe d’Etudes as a means of securing representation on an equal footing with the Russian representation on the Societe ; and that (&lt;2) the Government of India might safely undertake to give a “ rebate ” guarantee, limited to the amount of the net profits gained by Indian railways from interchange of traffic with the Trans-Persian Railway. 3. We concur generally in these conclusions and recommend that the alignment from Yezd via Purg and Ramiskh to Charbar be put forward as a compromise, to meet the objections raised by the Russian Consortium to the Yezd-Bandar Abbas project. The difference in distance between the two alignments is negligible; the commercial advantages of the Yezd-Charbar line are evident; while the strategical conditions are in both cases very much the same. 4. The objects and methods of the proposed Societe d’Etudes are not altogether clear from the papers before us; and we have no information as to the financial standing and repute of its members or promoters. These are inatters on which Your Lordship is in a position to judge, while we are not. If, however, you are satisfied that there are adequate guarantees of the good A2 faith of the syndicate, we think it would be desirable that we should take our share in such a contribution to their expenses as would secure the equal representation on their body of British and Russian interests. Assuming that the Russian Government subscribe £ 30,000 to the funds of the Societd we should be prepared to find half of an equivalent amount, or £15,000; the other half being a charge, under the ordinary rule, on the British Treasury. 6. As regards the question of a Government guarantee of the line, we are not prepared to offer an opinion at present ; but if this should prove to be necessary for the furtherance of the scheme, we should be willing to consider the grant of an indirect guarantee in the shape recommended by the Com mittee. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquis, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, r $t? /ft? t • / CUL • &gt;( Confidential.) Further Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the pro- prosed Trans-Persian Railway. , The Secretary of State has sent to the Government of India further papers in regard to the proposed Trans-Persian Railway and has requested their views thereupon, especially on the question whether the objection of the Russian promoters to the route via Bandar Abbas could be met, without detriment to Indian interests, by bringing the line from Yezd via Kerman to the coast at Chahbar. This question has been remitted to the Committee, and it has also been suggested to them that they should consider the feasibility of yet another alignment, namely, fiom Yezd to Chahbar without passing through Kerman. These two alternative alignments are examined in Sections I and^II of this report. In Section III the Committee have considered the desirability of a British contribution to the Societe d’Etudes (see letter from M. Homiakoff to Sir A. Kicolson of 17th July 1911—Annex 3 to Secretary of State’s despatch, Secret No. 24 of 18th August 3911) and of a financial guarantee, wdien the railway is working, on the lines of the rebates granted on Indian railways (see letter from Messrs. Baring Brothers to Sir A. ^Nicolson of 13th July 1911— Annex 1 to the same despatch). Y .—Alignment from Yezd via Kerman to Chahbar. 2. The strategical disadvantages to India of a railway cutting across Persia from the north-west to join the Indian railway system either at Nushki or Karachi have already been so fully indicated* (see enclosures 4 and 6 of Government of India Secret-External despatch No. 18, dated 23rd February 1911) that it seems only necessary now to recapitulate such arguments as may assist in answering the question now put to the Government of India by the Secretary of State in the paper under consideration, viz., whether it would be possible, without detriment to Indian interests, to meet the wishes of the Russian Consortium so far as to agree to an alignment Yezd Kerman- Chahbar and thence by the coast to Karachi, instead of the Bandar Abbas- Yezd route. 3. The final section of the alignment now suggested (viz., from Chahbar to Karachi) will run near the sea and so is vulnerable to England’s sea power though of course not to the same extent as a line from Bandar Abbas to Karachi. We do not think that the difference in the extent of the line on the sea-face would by itself justify rejection of the Russian proposal. But we have also to consider whether an enemy, who has once acquired a through line from the Caucasus, or from the head of the Gulf, to Kerman and Bam, would not be in a position to continue his advance inland through a rich country such as Seistan, instead of having to proceed by the exposed and barren route along the coast. 4. In our previous report we did not think it necessary to discuss the strategical advantages and disadvantages of this route, as on commercial grounds alone we considered that, of the different alignments from Yezd to Karachi, that via Bandar Abbas had overwhelmingly the strongest claims. If the route via Kerman and Bam is considered from the strategical point of view, it will be seen at once that Kerman is dangerously close to Seistan (260 miles). Moreover, the route via Bam to Seistan is by no means deficient of water at the present time, and might readily be so improved as to supply a considerable army : it was a trade route of importance in ancient times, and during the last few years has been regularly used by arms caravans going to or returning from the Mekran coast. We are advised, therefore, that once a hostile army has established itself at Kerman, a considerable force could, without much difficulty, be developed against Seistan. In this connection, it must be remembered that a line such as is now contemplated could maintain a force of greater strength than the whole of the present army in India together with the Home Expeditionary Force.I 2 5. The General Staff argue that having gained a position in Seistan, Eussia would he able (presuming this railway from the Caucasus to Kerman was built) ' to throw a force upon the Afghan frontier, on the Kandahar flank, from the double direction of the Caucasus and the combined position in Trans- Caspia and Turkistan ” (see Committee of Imperial Defence paper No. 52 D., remarks by Lord Curzon), that is to say, that the Helmand position would be turned and we should be forced to accept decisive battle at the gates of India itself near Quetta, and probably with inferior numbers. In connection with this part of the subject, we have also appended to our report some further notes Lord Curzon, which have been received with a batch of Committee of Imperial Defence papers since our former report was framed, and also a note by Mr. Balfour on the danger of Seistan being connected with the Russian Empire. Lord Curzon’s notes deal with Captain Rittich’s Report on Russian Railways in Persia. The project which Captain Rittich advocated was practically the same as that now advocated by the Russian Syndicate, but was of course for a purely Russian railway. 6. We recognise that the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 has for the time being, and, perhaps, for many years to come, placed a different com- plexion on the situation. But wdiile agreements may lapse or be broken, railways are comparatively speaking permanent, and in considering the align ment of a railway destined to link up the frontiers of Russia and India, we have to take all contingencies into account. We agree, therefore, with the view laid before us by the General Staff that the strategical reasons against allowing a through railway to be constructed from the Caucasus, or the head of the Gulf, direct to Kerman are so weighty that the Government of India should oppose such an alignment by all the means at its disposal. 7. Another point requires notice. The Russian Syndicate, like ourselves, foresee a time when the Baghdad Railway will be extended into Southern Persia, and compete with through traffic with Europe. Eor this reason thev say that they wish to avoid Bandar Abbas. But the junction of the two lines is, it seems to us, only a matter of time and the selection of a line further east ward would only postpone the competition w r hich they fear, for a term of years, which is insignificant compared to the vast future which lies before this railway. We do not, therefore, consider that any weight need be attached to this contention. 8. We have so far demonstrated that for very strong political and military reasons it is most essential that the main route should not pass tlirough Kerman, and we are also in a position to show that commercially the Bandar Abbas route is the better alignment. 9 \ Homiakoff’s letter to Sir A. Nicholson, dated the 17th July 1911, it is stated “that it is indispensable condition for the commercial success of the railway that the line through Persia should be as short and straight as possible in order to enable it to compete both with other existing means of transit and possible future lines ”. This expression of opinion is true ^ 1 f D the C : °! lntry traversp d ^ the shorter route is of a similar character \ aVe !f d b *T a lon S er route * When the character of the country passed through on the alternative routes differs most materially, the shorter route b i S 1 m ountainous tract and the longer route running through ™ i! V i C0untl 7» the cost of haulage by the shorter but steeper-graded therefore com p 131 ] 1 tbe C0st haulage by the longer route. The latter ffovern the rHtp« e f Cla tvf eco ^ ues tbe better one to adopt, since haulage charges govern the rates for the carriage by rail of goods and produce. unsuh%e Th ^ S n ggeS - +1 ? n ? ade Mr * E^iakoff is that,if Nushki be found w'ould suit Bnssi'n^ 01 - 1 ° .J U i nctl 1 ° n and ^ Karachi be recommended instead, it The Secretary of iV? 0 ' 8 lf t le aIl o nment ra n from Kerman direct to Karachi, alignment mhrht 38 a modificati o n to this proposal that the the 5 sea-face m r( i? 1 J^ e f man the coast at Chahbar and thence along obiection that tho ^ ^° tb these alignments are open to the commercial in J mileage lenofh C ° St 0t 1 W0rking th em would far outweigh the saving via Bandar ai ^ advis 1 ed that goods could be carried from Yezd Abbas to Karachi at cheaper rates, owing to the flat gradients, rthat! it wruld be cev'essarv to charge if the rio Kerman rente were adopted, 11* api'end to tb:^ report a section of the line from Cbstbar to Kerman ri-i Pam our and Bam. and it mav be taken that the direct route from Kerman to Karachi would be a still more difficult section to work from th© railway point of riew. It will be seen that the line would hare to rise OYer two passes, ore '.300 feet high ar.d the other 3,300 feet hisrh. To surmount these heights the grades would have to be very steep, necessitating liirht loads and the provision of very heavy locomotives, both for direct haulage and banking purposes. The speeds would be slow and the cost of working very high. As illustrating this 1 st point, it will be useful to point out that on hill lines in India the Government of Inoia have admitted the high cost of working such grades as womd be met on the Kennan-Chahbar route by allowing hill railways to charge verv much higher maxima than is the ordinarv fixed standard for W • 'O • railways generally in India :— The K: ika-Simla Kailway is allowed to charge 4 times the ordinary maxima. The Ootacamund Kail wav is allowed to charge 8 times the ordinarv maxima, The Barjeeling-Himalayan Railway is allowed to charge 5 times the ordinary maxima. The distance from Yerd to Karachi via Kerman is 1.147 miles, and from the same place rid Bandar Abbas to Karachi 1,341 miles, a difference of 194 miles. The advantage derived from this difference would more than disappear with tue higher rates which would have to be levied by the r.d Kerman route. 12. We have, therefore, no hesitation in advising that the via Bandar Abbas route is by far the better route to adopt from the point of view of cheaper working cost, which would permit of lower rates being charged for public traffic than it would be necessary to exact if the rid Kerman rout© were selected. Jl. —Alignment from Tezd to Chahbar with out passing through Kerman, 13. So far as we are able to ascertain from the Route Books, the best and most economical alignment both from the point of view of construction and working to follow on this route, would be via Furg and Ramishk to Chahbar. The most difficult section of this alignment, namely, from Yczd to Furg, would be common to this route and the one ria Bardar Abbas, and we are of opinion, consequently, that the cost of working the railway by either of these routes would be approximately the same, especially as the route to Chahbar via Furg and Ramishk will be a little shorter (about 4*0 miles &lt; than that by Bandar Abbas. As compared with the Yezd-Kerman-Chahbar route, the route via Furg and Ramisbk to Chahbar would have considerable advantages ; ample length would be available for the line to ascend to the heights to be crcssed, thus providing easv grading, whereas on the Kerman-Chahbar route the heights rise abruptly and’ having to be surmounted in short distances, involve very severe gradients. 14. We consider, therefore, that from a commercial point of view this alignment is immensely superior to that via Kerman, and that there is not very much to choose between it and the alignment via Bandar Abbas. From a military point of view the alignment has the great advantage of not passing through Kerman. It is not so favourable to British interests as the alignment via Bandar Abbas, in that the portion running along the sea coast is very much shorter, but, as we have already stated in paragraph 3 above, we do not consider that this drawback should by itself be considered fatal. We are of opinion, therefore, that while the Bandar Abbas route would he the best from the point of view of British and Indian interests, the route via Furg and Ramishk to Chahbar is to a large extent free from the objections which we have had to urge a^inst the other ^alternative routes, and might be recommended to His Majesty’s Government as a possible basis for arriving at a compromise.III.— The Societe d'Etudes and the Proposed Guarantee. 15. We now propose to examine the two questions of— (a) A contribution to the “ Societe d’Etudes ”, the syndicate which is to be formed— (1) To further preliminary investigation. (2) To negotiate with the Persian Government to obtain the necessary concessions. (3) Einally to form the Company for the construction of the railway. (5) A guarantee by the British Government to the Company to be formed to build and work the railway. 16. On the first question, considered solely from the business point of view, we are in entire accord with the opinions expressed by Mr. Huth Jackson in his letter of the 18th July 1911; but we recognise that the question requires consideration also from the point of view of general policy. 17. It is stated in Mr. Horaiakoff’s letter of the 17th July 1911, to Sir A. Nicholson, that the leading Ilussian Banks have subscribed a capital of 300,000 roubles, say £30,000, towards the establishment of a Societe d’Etudes for the objects quoted above. It seems likely, though we have no definite information on the point, that the Russian Government are in reality behind this subscription, and the question arises whether it would not be desirable that His Majesty’s Government should also, directly or indirectly, contribute to the expenses of the “ Societe d’Etudes ” with a view to obtaining a measure of control over their operations, and thus making more secure our position in respect of the Company which is eventually to be formed. We consider that it is of the greatest importance that the United Kingdom should not be left out of the preliminary negotiations to be undertaken by the Societe d’Etudes, especially in view of the possibility that German financiers might be more than willing to step in. We would, therefore, advise that £30,000 be found by India and England as the British contribution to the Societe d’Etudes, on the condition that British and Russian representation in the Societe be equal. 18. The exact form in which this contribution should be made will have to be decided in London. If objection is taken to Government subscribing direct, especially as the Russian Government have not professedly done so, we would suggest that it might be possible to arrange terms on which some lead ing bank or group of financiers in England would be willing to make the contribution, Government retaining sufficient powers in regard to the selection and subsequent action of the British representatives on the Societe. 19. With regard to (5), the question of a guarantee to the Company to be formed to build and work the line, it is stated that the Russian Government are prepared to consider the question of an indirect guarantee to the scheme in contemplation by reserving a certain proportion of their railway revenue surplus for this purpose, in consideration of the increased traffic on lines in Russian territory, which would necessarily accrue from the opening of a trans-Persian railway to India—see Annex 1 to Secretary of State’s despatch No. 24 of 18th August 1911. 20. The wording of this proposal is not very clear, but it would appear to indicate a financial arrangement similar to the &lt;c rebate ” system on Indian railways. On those railways, “ rebate ” is very often given to assist in the formation of a company to construct a line. The Southern Punjab Railway is a leading case in point. This line, with the extensions recently sanctioned, i® a bout 600 miles long and the capital has been raised under a “ rebate ” given by the North-Western State Railway. The amount so paid by the North-Western Railway is limited to the net profits earned by the North- Western Railway on the traffic interchanged, and the rebate is only payable up to an amount sufficient for the Southern Punjab Railway to earn a fixed percentage on its capital, the rebate being the difference between what the line actually earns in dividend and the amount of the fixed dividend decided on.ft ‘ re ^ at e ” guarantee on the terms applied to Indian railways is lierefore no new proposition to India, and we think that the Government of India might commit itself to the extent of agreeing to give a “rebate ” on the same terms as are applied ^ to Indian railways. We are inclined to doubt whether the investing public will understand and be induced to invest their capital on a rebate guarantee, as it has taken a long time to educate English investors in Indian railways to this form of guarantee. Nevertheless the recommendation seems to us one which might safely be adopted. We do not P la f es an 7 g rea t liability on the Government of India, or any liability which the Government of India could not fairly accept, as the rebate to which we would agree would be limited to the net profits gained by Indian railways from interchange of traffic with the Trans-Persian Railway; and at the same time the recommendation has the advantage of being in accord with the proposal (if we have understood it correctly) put forward on the Russian side. 1V. — Conclusions. Briefly summarised, our conclusions are as follows :— (i) We consider that both on military and commercial grounds the Government of India should resist any proposal to bring the railway through Kerman, and consequently should not agree to an alignment via Yezd-Kerman-Chahbar. (ii) The same objections do not appear to us to exist in regard to the alignment via Yezd-Eurg-Ramiskh-Chahbar, and while we hold to our previous opinion that the best alignment in British and Indian interests would be via Yezd-Bandar Abbas, we think for the reasons stated in our report that this route might be recom mended to His Majesty’s Government as a possible basis of compromise. (iii) We are in favour of a British contribution to the expenses of the Societe d’Etudes as a means of securing representation equal to the Russian representation on the Societe. (iv) We think that the Government of India might undertake, in the event of the line being constructed, to give a “ rebate ” guarantee, limited to the amount of the net profits gained by Indian Railways from interchange of traffic with the Trans-Persian Railway.

(1) Notes by Lord Curzon {dated 26th February 1904) on Captain Uittieh’s Report on Russian Railways in Rersia. c !how appears upon the scene Captain Bittich and his men ; and they produce a scheme which seems to me to be based upon profound political and strategical insight, and, if realised, to secure for Russia all that she desires with the maximum of advantage to herself and the maximum of detriment to us. Ret me point out the nature of the advantages to Russia, under the two heads, political and strategical— “ I.—Political. , “ (i) Cutting across Persia diagonally from north-west to south-east the projected line would place in Russian hands the whole of the principal cities of Persia from Tabriz to Kerman, including Kazvin, Hamadan (by a branch line Kazvin-Hamadan), dehran, Rum, Kashan, Ispahan (by a branch line Kashan- Ispahan) and Yezd. The whole of the central Persian plateau would thus fail under Russian control, and from this line she could push her influence south- wards to such places as Sultanabad, Shiraz and elsewhere as she pleased. “ (ii) Such a line would not merely firmly establish Russian influence throughout the whole of Central Persia, hut it would also effectually destroy British influence in the south, for it would skirt, along its northern flank, the whole of the sphere that we have hitherto been disposed to claim. “ (hi) The line would be a relatively cheap and easy one to construct, for it would proceed through a generally level country, with a few mountain passes; and it would also be cheap and easy to guard, for the tribes along it are of a peaceful character and would give no trouble. “ II.— Strategical. “ The strategical advantages of the line are even more striking. “ (i) It possesses the supreme merit of enabling the Russians to direct against Southern Persia, or against the Indian frontier on the Seistan-Mekran section, the whole of the troops of the Caucasus, escaping both the Caspian crossing, the precarious transit along the single line of the Trans-Caspian Railway, and the long march southwards from the direction of Meshed. “ (ii) It possesses the scarcely inferior merit, from the Russian standpoint, of avoiding the Gulf altogether, with a British fleet patrolling it, with British forces very likely in occupation of its principal ports and with British warships closing its mouth. It takes Russia right out into the open ocean, and plants her on the sea at Chahbar, a place which by dint of the great expenditure that Russia is never reluctant to undertake could be converted into a naval base of considerable strength, in close proximity to the western borders of British protected territory. “ (iii) Similarly, if a branch line were constructed from Bam to Seistan, would the railway enable Russia to reinforce her position in Seistan, and to throw a force upon the Afghan frontier, on the Kandahar flank, from the double direction of the Caucasus and the combined position in Trans-Caspia and Turkistan. “ (iv) The line would be absolutely invulnerable against British attack until it reached the neighbourhood of the British frontier. It would be pro tected by the great desert on the north, and by mountains on the south. It would be too far from the sea to be cut from that quarter; and it would have achieved its purposes before we could even scratch its extremities. “ Finally, the line possesses the physical advantages of running parallel, through its entire length, to the general trend of the Persian mountain system instead of attempting to cut it: and the commercial advantage of tapping all the principal entrepots of trade ”.2 Again, when at Home on leave, after seeing the English papers on Seistan, Lord Ourzon wrote on 1st June 1904 :— “ There is a general concurrence— “ (i) that Captain Eittich’s line of railway, involving a direct and independent communication with the Caucasus, would place Eussia in a position of overwhelming advantage on the flank of Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and would constitute a greater strategical danger to India than any Eussian scheme hitherto contemplated. This conclusion appears to have been accepted by all the authorities in England.’* (2) Note by Mr. Balfour {April 1904—Committee of Imperial Defence paper No. 46). “ ‘We must discourage the connection of Seistan by railway with any portion of the Eussian Empire. * * I am clear that, in addition to the occupation of Chahbar, we should employ every means at our disposal for preventing the project of a Caueasus-Chahbar or a Caucasus-Seistan railway being seriously proposed foreign Office Free*— No. 1637-23.10-11—44'l [BJ PERSIA.

I A ElsTURE to trespass for a few minutes upon you time, hoping that what I write may justify my doing so. I am in no sense financially or from the point of view of any prospective advantage concerned in the Trans-Persian Railway. The meeting in Paris on Thursday, the 30th November, was inconclusive as regards finance, dhe drench financier, M. Bardac, would not commit himself, much to the disappointment of the Russian group, which was strongly represented. It was known further that the British financiers approached had also held back. What transpired gave me a direct insight into Russian aims and ambitions, which made me welcome some delay. A\hen I heard one Russian representative reiterate the statement, “ Russia must have a port at Oharbar,” I thought of Lord Curzon’s denunciation of the Minister who would grant a foreign Power a port on the Persian Gulf, and I asked myself, “ If we are so tenacious of Koweit and the Turkish littoral, are we to be less so of Oharbar and the Persian? ” It seemed to me that the Russian had a vision of a Russian railway (5-foot gauge) constructed right across Persia to Charbar, and carrying thousands of tons of Indian and Ceylon tea to the Russian market ; but 1 conceive that British and Indian financiers, contractors, and manufacturers look forward—and justly—to financing, constructing, and supplying the trans-Persian line from Kurrachee, at least as far as the western border of the British sphere in Persia. The Indian Government reserves to itself the right of admitting railways from the Persian side into Afghan territory. Surely the approach of railways to the Persian Gulf must be no less carefully safeguarded. When I addressed the Central Asian Society in February last, I dwelt on the importance of a Trebizond-Tabreez-Kazvin Railway as a feeder of the trans-Persian line. The Paris correspondent of the “ Times,” writing on the 8th instant and supporting most strongly the Anglo-Russian entente in Persia, mentions that German merchandise now enters Northern Persia through Trebizond. (I should say, myself, not only German, but the merchandise of many nations.) If we consent to excluding the Trebizond traffic from the Trans-Persian Railway we shall deprive that “ international ” railway of that which may enable it to pay a dividend, and at the same time afford Germany an extra cause for grievance. There was a report in the press the other day that Russia was in the humour to accede to Turkish railway expansion in North-East Asia Minor. If that be so, and should British influence advocate the union of Turkish and Persian lines—a union that surely must come sooner or later—then I urge that no obstacle be put in the way of the construction of a line from Trebizond to Tabreez. Whether in connection with the Trans-Persian Railway the “ battle of the gauges ” will be fought out with the same vigour, not to say acrimony, with which it was fought out in India years ago, remains still to be seen. I heard an Anglo-Indian engineer who witnessed it all, and rose to high position, remark the other day that India was now regretting that it had not universally adopted the standard gauge of 4 ft. 8^ in. I think it is possible that Persia may live to regret that it was not allowed to adopt that gauge. What I foresee is this : Russia pushing her 5-foot gauge everywhere she can, and thus enforcing on Persia numerous breaks of gauge both in the interior of the country and on its frontier, where it marches with Turkey. This, no doubt, will admirably suit Russia, whose manufacturers will supply rails, rolling-stock, and all material, and whose contractors will construct the line. If it is the destiny of more than half Persia—say to a line drawn from Khanikin through Ispahan and Yezd to Meshhed and the Hari Rud, i.e., the northern half—to become Russian territory, then we cannot but compliment Russia on the foresight which prompted her to extend to that territory the Russian railway gauge. If, however, the independence and integrity of Persia, as guaranteed under the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, is maintained, then I have a strong conviction that the 4 ft. 8^ in.2 ft gauge will suit Persia best. It is less costly than the broader, and therefore the International Trans-Persian Railway will sooner pay a dividend. My latest information is that the French financiers are now eager to get into this enterprise, and that the English ones are following suit. It looks as if the first Indo-European railway was about to become a reality. J**' I remain, Yours truly, A. C. YATE.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Gnvm-mnpnt. 1 I HAVE the honour to report that the “Novoe Vremya ” of the Ith’January publishes a long article on the trans-Persian railway scheme. The article is founded on a telegram from London announcing that representatives of English, French, and Russian banking houses will shortly meet in Pans to arrange preliminaries for financing the railway. The writer disapproves strongly of the 'whole policy of the Potsdam interviews and the Russo-German agreement, declaring that the withdrawal of opposition to the Bagdad railway was equivalent to rendering direct financial assistance to the Germans, and that it sacrifices the economic advantages of Russia in the Persian market. “ Thanks to the Potsdam interview, the railway, a German line, will reach Khanikin in the near future.” But, not content with this, Russian diplomacy in binding itself to construct the Khanikin-Tehran railway has opened a way for German trade into the heart of Persia. The writer says that there is no use in crying over the blunders committed in the past. They cannot be undone, but their evil effects may perhaps in some measure be mitigated, and the best antidote is the construction of Russian lines into Persia. There have been many schemes on paper, but none of them have come to anything, and pessimists have hitherto included the trans-Persian scheme among those which were predestined to failure for lack of the necessary financial support. The article claims that the news from London proves that the pessimists were wrong, and that the trans-Persian scheme is now materialising. It then dwells on its political significance. All Russia’s enemies are endeavouring to make use of events in Persia in order to excite European public opinion against her. Their objects are: (1) to destroy the Anglo-Russian agreement, (2) to encourage an Anglo-German under standing directed against Russia, and (3) to attract France into the orbit of this combination. The destruction of the Triple Entente would render the realisation of the trans-Persian scheme impossible, and would pave the way for a continuation of the German Bagdad railway to the Indian Ocean, and even to the frontiers of India. trans-Persian railway, which pre-supposes the establishment of order and security in Persia. route, concludes the article, will be one of the strongest buttresses of the general peace of Europe.

Huseia appears to consider this an opportune mo ment to undertake big railway schemes in Western Asia and Persia. M the same time comes the announcement that the Russian Government has called upon the Porte to connect # / the Turkish railway system in Asia finor with the Russian system, and that the financial preparations are to be made for the scheme of a railway crossing the whole of Persia via Teheran to the Indian Ocean at Gwatar on the B«XttChi*tan frontier.

A glance at the m&lt;ip shows what enormous tracts of country in Western Asia are waiting to be opened up by railway construction, that most power ful pioneer of commerce, of industrial energy and of order. f Both linos - the one connecting Constantinople and thereby Southern and Western Europe with Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf, the other connecting northern and Eastern Europe to India - have each their special tasks which are clearly defined in each district. Only on one section will there be any connection between them, namely from Teheran to Khani^in and Bagdad. But this line is stipulated for in the Ru&amp;so-ferman treaty; Russia en gaged to build it with a view to opening up a part of Persia to the Bagdad Railway, whereas Germany, as is well known, renounced all railway undertakings in Persia. AccordinglyAccordingly the trans Persian railway is not only not a competitive undertaking hut rather an assistance to the Bagdad Bailway. ?roa the German point of view therefore the Kusslan plan must onl- he wished success. The fact that ’'reach and English capital is to he employed and that England will make certain demands for the section falling in its present sphere of influence in Southern Persia cannot materially influence the German view of the undertaking.
