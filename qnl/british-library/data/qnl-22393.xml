On arrival the ship flew the Shaikh*e flag and fired a salute of two guns when 1 haikh 2 tthassznad disembarked* On enquiry from the Captain of * rura' who was new to the Persian Culf it wae found that Shaikh Muhammad had asked him to fire the salute* Representations were made to Shaikh lea regarding the salute and hie eon sent In a letter of apology to the olitleal Agent. Two of these cases were an endeavour on the part of fchaikh lea to assert his authority over asawls and i ajdie. » In one care the Amir of ; uharraq Island arrested and imprisoned kasawls by order of Lhaikh Isa who on represen tation argued that the . asawls were under hie Jurisdiction but he was told that this could not be recognised* Ehaikh Isa promised that this will not occur again and sent the Amir of uhaxsraq to the Agency to apologise to the Poli- ticel Agent* In the other care the Amir of anarrah took a deposit of £ 4/- from a foreign subject who was suspected of having pearls in his poseeesion belonging to his nakhuda On hearing the matter the political Agent sent for the Amir and recovered the money which was handed over to the man whose case was then dealt in the Agency* &lt;’he Amir apologisedr . .

The dispute was between the youngest brother of the Amir and the three baluchis over some prostitutes - The Amir was alleged to have cpoken roughly and abused the three baluchis. On being asked to release the baluchie Fh&amp;ikh Isa stated at first that he would rather leave Bahrain himself than release the two of the three baluchis who were chained up or to hand them over to the political Agency ae they were born in Bahrain and were in hie eervice and claimed that they were his subjects,but eventually His Kxoellency gave in and the matter was amicably settled.

II. „Hal JiH *184 &lt;fc Ah KHAblfiJi FAMILY . (a). Relations with Shaikh one of the oldest Arab member of the Majlis-al-Urfi was removed by Shaikh Isa, at the instance of another Arab who had personal animosity against him, without consulting the Political Agent. It was a test case and an endeavour on the part of Shaikh Isa to assert his authority regarding the question of removal and nomination of members of the Majlis-al-Urfi• Shaikh 'Isa had been led to believe by certain interested persons that he had the right to dismiss any member of the Majlis-al-Urfi at pleasure under the terms of the Order-in-Council which cams into force from February 3rd,1919. Representations were at once made to Shaikh Isa, who deputed his son Shaikh Abdullah to interview the political Agent regarding the Majlis and his supposed right over it. Shaikh Abdullah was given thoroughly to understand that the Political Agent could not countenance any changes in the functions and composition of the Majlis-al- Urfi without being consulted, this being in accordance with For General political Atmosphere of Bahrain the following references should be studied:- (1) Memo *0.6-0 of 5-1-1920 from P.A., Bahrain to G.G., Baghdad dc D.P.&amp;. Buahire• (2) p.A.Bahrain 1 s Diary:- * 0 .ik-28/43 of 31-11-19 *0.1317/48 Of 31-12-19 *0.25 (a)-C. of 31-1-20 *o.89-C of 31-3-1920. ) Isa have continued fairly satisfactory with the ex ception of the question of Majlis-al-Urfi which ceased working from 15th April 1919 On that date Ahmad Yatim one existingexisting ruling* shaikh laa insisted that it was his right to send the weekly notice calling the Majlis to meet and not the political Agent’s, and that the composition would be the same, as agreed on between the Political Agent and himself with the exception of Ahmad Xatim, who, had resigned and not been dis missed as reported. In point of fact Ahmad Yatim had been dis missed by Shaikh Isa but had received further instructions to give out that he had resigned of his own free will. Ahmad Yatim confessed this to the Political Agent. Whilst this vexed question was still being discussed Captain Bray received orders to pro ceed to England with Shaikh Abdullah’s mission, and no further progress was made in the matter. (b) Before leaving Bahrain and unknown to Captain Bray, Shaikh Isa instructed his son Shaikh Abdullah to approach the King- Emperor in London with four petitions for favourable considera tion. They were as follows:- (1) That the Chief of Bahrain should be placed on an equal line with other neighbouring Arab Rulers and to exercise full Jurisdiction over all Subjects in his territory. (2) . That the election of the members of the MaJlis-al-Urfi should be one of the rights of the Chief of Bahrain. (3) . That the port of Zubarah on the Qatar peninsula as it once belonged to his forefathers should be made over to him. (4) . The privilege of a direct reference to higher authority should be given to the Chief of Bahrain. (o). One of Major Dickson’s first acts on arrival at Bahrain was to again take up the question of MaJlis-al-Urfi. In Hovember 19IS representations were made to Shaikh Isa with a view to re starting the Majlis. Shaikh Isa after much 'beating about the bush** deputed his son Shaikh Abdullah to interview the Political Agent on the matter. A frank and full discussion took place which was followed by Shaikh Abdullah raising the four points raised in London and asking advice as to the reasons why an answer had not been received. During this conversation Shaikh Abdullah disclosed the fact that Shaikh Isa was not particularly anxiouss anxious for an answer his only anxiety beln^ lest Governmen t were annoyed f^r putting forward petitions whioh he now knew he should not have done# The interview terminated by Shaikh Abdullah accepting the Political Agent’s view that the ruling in the order-in-Jounoil part 1 para 4 should be carried out until a definite ruling oorae from the Government. * For correspondence arid views of Political Agent, Bahrain on Shaikh abdullah’s four requests to His Majesty's Government see letter fio*9-u dated 10th January 19&amp;0 from the political Agent to the Deputy Political Resident and Mo#18-0 dated BSrd January 1G£0 to the Deputy Political Resident, Bushire copy to Civil Commissioner, Baghdad* (d). on £3rd January 1920, Shaikh Isa finally consented to the election of half the members of the MaJlis-al-Urfi by the Political Agent and the other half by himself f on which date M-Jlis was duly appointed, members selected and work has been carried on since* (e) The Bahrain Order-in-council was brought into force from noon of February 3rd. shaikh Isa was brought round with difficulty to accept all the terms mentioned therein* (f) . as mentioned above shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and his son Muhammad proceeded to England on June Oth as the guest of His Majesty's Government* Shaikh Abdullah thoroughly enjoyed the trip and realised the greatness and magnificence of the Capital of the British ampire* it is doubtful however whether his visit has not done more harm than good* He saw much of an unhealthy and demoralizing nature especially in Paris, and has come back with many wild Political ideas whioh he had not before* Shaikh A Abdullah returned from England on October 27th. At the suggestion of 'al Malika' shaikh Abdullah's motherland only living wife of Shaikh lsa f all the houses and huts of Bahrain were dressed with red and green flags for 6 days in his honour* III* VICToRIa MlMoMIjiu HooplIrtX, .

On 26th December 1919 the Political Agent Major Dickson, C.I.JS., mads an exhaustive tour of the Island. See Diary lo.1317/43 dated 31st December 1^19. on 29th January 1920 the Political Agent Visited Hoffuf in Hassa on a special mission to Bin Saud.For Journey to Hassa see letter No.40-0 dated 21st February 1920 addressed to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad and Deputy political Resident, Bushire. BLa SiiUJ . (a) During the early and middle part of 1919 re lations between Bin Saud and the Shareef Hussain were very strained. Matters came to a head in the vicinity of Khurma and Tarabah, which places were attacked and occupied by the Amir Ali the Shareef 1 s son, but were as promptly recaptured by the forces of bin Saud with the destruction of the entire forces of bin Saud was ordered by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad to return to Riyadh at once on pain of having his subsidy stopped. He promptly complied and explained the whole situation in a series of lengthy reports. His explanation was accepted by His Majesty^ Government and matters have been temporarily settled. In the meantime the trouble between Bin Saud and the Shareef is engaging the careful attention of His Majesty’s Government. Unless a modus vivendi acceptable to both parties is found before the Haj season, fighting will break out again. (b) Shaikh Faisal bin Abdul Aziz bin Saud son of the Ruler of lajd arrived in Bahrain on August 17th and proceeded to England on August 30th as a guest of His Majesty’s Government. He was accompanied by Major H.E.Bowman. The party arrived in London on 13th October 1919 and were received by His Majesty the King in Buckingham Palace on 30th October 1919* On 2flth November 1919 they attended a joint conference of India and ForeignForeign.Offices to discuss Arabian affairs. The party returned to Bahrain on 8th February 1^20 and reached Hassa on 12th February 1920• (c) . The safety of the Hassa Miyadh trade was maintained A during the year. This being entirely due to the splendid and re markable work done by the Amir Bin Jaloui, cousin of Shaikh Sir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman ai Saud, and ruler of Hassa and ^atif. Mo praise is too high for the work done by this man and it is hoped His Majesty’s Government will see its way to recognize the exceptional qualities of this man by a fitting regard in the near future. (d) . The akhwan movement . For a full report, on this revival see my M0.S2-G dated 5th March 1920 to the Civil ftp Commissioner, Baghdad and Copy sent to Deputy Political Resident Bushire• (e) . Bin Saud has recently lodged a formal complaint against Shaikh Isa of Bahrain charging 5 per cent on goods passing % through Bahrain en route for iejd. He contends au*h goods should pay no duty to the Shaikh of Bahrain as they are neither consigned to nor are intended for Bahrain. For information on this subject see Memo M0.58-C dated 28th February 1920 from the Political Agent, Bahrain to the Deputy Political Resident, Bushire. The matter is now under consideration. (f) . Jurisdiction over subjects of Bin Saud whilst on a visit to, or resident in Bahrain. Bin Saud raised this question whilst the political Agent was in Hassa last February. He is very anxious that all his Subjects should be considered as under the British Agency's protection whilst in Bahrain. His desire haa been strengthened recently owing to the fact coming to li#it of several cases of 'Zulum' towards his Subjects. For correspondence on the subject see political Agent's Memo Mo.84-G dated 89th March 1920 also Diary Mo.89-0 dated 51st arch 1920 para B-3. The matter is still^consideration. (g). Opening up of Ojair and Jubail Harbours on the main land of Hassa as ports to serve Mejd, Qassim and Hassa.VII VIII. IX. Bin Baud intimatad to the political Agent while in Haasa that he waa anxioua to take the above work in hand ) and officially asked hia kajesty’a Government that they try and get the British India steam Mavigation Company to run a steamer at once to ujair, and later on another to Jubail. For correspondence, see political Agent Bahrain's Memo lo.Sl-O dated 25th February 1920 to the Deputy Political Resident and Civil Commiasioner, Baghdad; also see political Agent Bahrain's Dairy of recent trip to Hassa IO.40-C dated 21st February 1920* % The above matter has not yet gone beyond the initial stages. It is hoped that the Deputy political Resident will shortly visit Gjaifc, Mas Tanurah, and Jubail with the Political Agent Bahrain, when it will be possible to decide on the merits of each^as the future harbour and port of lejd. Friendly correspondence on minor matters ; and giving of news ; has been kept up with Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim ath Thani. Shaikh Abdullah waa Gazetted C.I.X., on June 3rd, 1919. CUox^^s BiiHRAii'U (a) Rao Sahib Tirathdaa Maharaj, late Director o$ Customs Bahrain, headman of the Hindu Community in Bahrain and Brahmin Community in Karachi died of diabetes at Karachi. He had $ greatly assisted the Agency in putting stop to smuggling of food-stuffs to Tangistan coast during the blockade and was especially thanked by the Deputy Political Resident Colonel A. p. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.K., for good work. Bahrain Customs could ill-afford to lose the services of such valuable and devoted officer and Shaikh Isa still feels his loss. • (b). On 9th March 1920 the Deputy Political Resident intimated-that the cash deposit system had been finally abolished see Political Agent's Diary for March M0.89-C dated 31st March 1920 para 4 D. 0f BriHidxlR TR-tiDK . For full report under this head see Bahrain . i • *r Trade report for 1919 sent to Civil Commissioner Baghdad ani the Deputy political Resident, Persian Gulf under this office fto.102 dated 19th January 1920* SHIPPING . The upward mails have been calling very regularly, 1 butbut the down mail i.e* from Basrah and Bushire may ba said to have ceased to exist. The very greatest inconvenience and delay has been caused to officials and merchants ( not to mention the great loss of trade that has resulted owing to merchants being unable to get away to India'. For further information see Bahrain political Diaries Mo.1317/45 dated 31st December 1^19 para 4. and MO.Q9-C dated 31st March 19B0 para 4 B. AhiluPMUMIC . Owing to the hopelessly bad state of the mail service from Baghdad and Bushire application was made to the Civil Commissioner for permission to lay out an aeroplane landing ground in Bahrain. The Civil Commissioner has recently sanctioned this being done under his letter Mo.8902 dated 12th March 1920* work of levelling and building corner pillars is in progress. MUM1C1BAL. SAMIT.iriQI .

I feel I cannot cloae t hia report without drawing the attention of Hia Majesty's Government to the excellent wopk done during the year bys- (a) Mr. Seyed Siddiq Haaan, Indian Assistant (b) Head Clerk Mr. J.M.Dacosta. Mi\ Seyad Siddiq Haaan held charge of the Bahrain Agency for 5 months during 1919 and by his tact and devotion to duty earned the eateem of Shaikh Isa and the mercjlfantile community of Bahrain. During the period he was in charge, all work was carried on in a smooth and quiet manner. Mr. Siddiq Haaan was granted the title of Khan Sahib in January last. Mr. J.M.Dacosta has shown himself a self reliant, hard working, and efficient -worker. He can be trusted to run an important post like the Bahrain Agency single handed. He is always cheerful and bright, and I have never had anything but praise for the way he keeps his accounts books and generally runs his office. Mr. Dacoataleaves Bahrain shortly to take up the post of Treasury Officer in Civil Commissioner's Office, Baghdad. As regards the remainder of the Office Establishment from what I have seen of their work I am satisfied. SPl-D&amp;MIC AMD ^UAMAMTIIE . During the year under review Assistart Surgeon G.K.Monani,L.M.&lt;* 3., has been in charge of Quarantine and town sanitation in addition to the Medical Charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital. otrenuoua work was done during the Influenza epidemic, which commenced at about the beginning of lovember 19lo and ended in January 1920• The epidemic passed over thetowns of Manama, Muharraq and Hadd affecting almost eaoh and every person to a greater or less extent. All the members of the Al Khalifah' I d family wara affaotad with the disease including His Excellency Shaikh Isa* All of them were treated by Assistant Surgeon G.K. Monani. ais excellency the shaikh was affected with Broncho pneumonia and his condition was critical and although he got » “ iU over the Illness with due care, the convalascence was prolonged and left him very weak till the advent of Spring* The whole epidemic was dealt with single-handed, the Mission Hospital being closed* Assistance was asked from Bushiie but they could not spare anyone* This was also the year for the probable recurrence of Plague in Bahrain which cones on every alternate year* before the probable season for the appearance of plague every effort was made to get the hen-ps of rubbish cleared off fro: the bazaars and streets. A keen watch was kept on the mortality of % rats in houses and godowns. The people were advised to keep their shops and godowns cleaned up, and to get them disinfected with so2 gas whenever any dead rat was picked up from them* Anti-Plague inoculation with prof* Haffkina’s Plague Prophylaetic was carried out. The whole of the detachment and such members of the Staff as were willing to be inoculated including Oapt. 4 Mrs. Bray were inoculated against^ the disease* Fortunately for every one the period passed off without any recurrence of the disease. This was the first time since the first appearance of Plague in bahrain in 1903 that the recurrence of the disease, which was usual every second year, did not take place* During the xmxkl outbreak of small-pox which is more or less endemic the whole of the Government Staff was protected against* the disease by re-vaceination*British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 24t April 1920. To The Political.Agent, Bahrain. Mey.-orandum . I have to return herewith your Administration Renort for amendment for the following reasons (1) it has been compiled for the period ending 31st parch financial year whereas the Administration Report for the Persian Gulf is for .the ordinary calendar year. Events occurring shortly #• after the end of the year mention or which corinletes the subject or is of special interest can be entered to briefly in brackets. (2) it is kee usual for an Administration Report to be self contained, and not to refer to a number of letters and reports. (3) It is not usual to praise Government officials by name in Administration ReuorlJ. 4 (4) There is usually some reference to the judicial work done by Political Agent and some statistics; also usually some remarks about rainfall and weather. In short there is a more or less recognized form for Administration Reports which are Government of India Annual Publications. Of course, if you can make the report rather more interesting than such things usually are, all the better. But certain information is supposed to be given. i Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf.POLITICAL'AGmIJICY BahrainJk the 17th May 1»20. J The Deputy political Resident, B U 3 H I R K. I have the honour to forward herewith ,in triplicate, Bahrain Administration Report for ISIS - amended according to your Bo* 135-3. dated 24th April 1JI20 • I much regret the Report is of such a skeleton and sketchy nature. ^ The fact^I only arrived an 8th Bovemher and after the year was practically over will^I trustee accepted as an excuse for the Reports shortcomings^ I have found the writing of this Report the more difficult, owing to the fact that I did not actually take over from Captain Iray my predecessor. That Officer fell sick and left Bahrain early in June, whilst between his departure and my arrival there was a bad hiatus of six months. It is hoped however when the time comes; that the Administration report for lt20 will give a fuller and more detailed picture of the affairs of Bahrain.Administration Report of the Bahrain political Agency for the year ItAt. by the following Officers for the period shown:- 0&lt;j.pt.iS.B.fi.Bray, M.O., from January 1st to June 5th.

SBaIAH 'ISa dt aL EHaLIFaH PaMILY . (a) Relations with % | Shaikh Isa have continued fairly satisfactory with the exception of the question of Majlis-al-Urfi which ceased working from 15th April 1919. On that date Ahmad Tatim one of the oldest Arab mem of the Majlis-al-Urfi was removed by Shaikh Isa, at the instance of another Arab who had personal animosity against him, without consulting the Political Agent. It was a test case and an en deavour on the part of Shaikh Isa to assert his authority re garding the question of removal and nomination of members of the Majlis-al-Urfi. Shaikh 'Isa had been led to believe by certain interested persons that he had the right to dismiss any member of the Majlis-al-Urfi at pleasure under the terms of the Order-in-Council which came into force from February 3rd, 1919. Representations wer^ at once made to Shaikh Isa, who deputed his son Shaikh Abdullah to interview the Political Agent regarding the Majlis and his supposed right over it. Shaikh Abdullah was given thoroughly to understand that the Political Agont could r not countenanco any changes in the functions and composition of the Majlis-al-Urfi without being consulted, this being in accord ance with existing ruling. Shaikh Isa insisted that it was his right to send the weekly notice calling the Majlis-Ao meet and not the Political Agent's, and that the composition would be the same as agreed on botween the Political Agent and himself !• P&gt;RoUJB jiL . Charge of the political Agency was held s3 with th* •xcaption of Ahmwd latlm, who had reoiimwd and not be*n diamiaaed as reported. In point of fact Ahmad Tatim had been give out that he had resigned of his own free will. Ahmad latim confessed this to the Political Agent. Whilst this vexed question! was still being discussed Captain Bray received orders to pro ceed to England with Shaikh Abdullah^ mission, and no further progress was made in the matter. (b). Before leaving Bahrain and unknown to Captain Bray, Shaikh Isa instructed his son Shaikh Abdullah to approach the king-Emperor in London with four petitions for favourable con sideration. They were as follows:- (l) That the Chief of Bahrain should be placed on an equal (2) That the election of the members of the MaJlis-al-Urfi should be one of the rights of the Chief of Bahrain. (3) That the port of Zubarah on the Qatar peninsula as it once belonged to his forefathers should be made over to him. ( 4 ) xhe privilege of a direct reference to higher authority ahould be given to the Chief of Bahrain. (c). One of Major Dickson’s first acts on arrival at Bahrain i'ilfi representations were made to Shaikh Isa with a view to re starting the Majlis. Shaikh Isa after much M beating about the bush' deputed his son Shaikh Abdullah to interview the Political Agent on the matter, a frank and full discussion took place which was followed by Shaikh Abdullah raising the four points raised in London and asking political Agent’s advice as to the reasons why an answer had not been received. During this con*- versation Shaikh Abdullah disclosed tihe fact that Shaikh Isa was not particularly anxious for an answer his only anxiety being lest Government were annoyed at his putting forward petitions which he now knew he should not have done. The inter view terminated by Shaikh Abdullah accepting the political dismissed by Shaikh Isa but had received further instructions to line with other neighbouring Arab Hulers and to exercise full jurisdiction over all Subjects in his territory. was to again take up the question of Majlis-al-Urfi. In flovember \ Agents3. Agent’s view that the ruling in the Order-in-Oounoil part I para 4 should bo carried out until a definite ruling came from the Government. ( Jote . On ki3rd January l^iiO* Shaikh Isa finally consented to the election of half the members of the MaJlis-al-Urfi by the Political Agent and the other half by himself, on which date Majlis was duly appointed, members selected and work, has been carried on since.) (d) . The Bahrain Grder-in-Gouncil was brought into force from noon of February 3rd, lilt. Shaikh Isa was brought round with difficulty to accept all the terms mentioned therein. (e) . As mentioned above Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and his son Muhammad proceeded to England on June fith as the guest of His Majesty's Government. Shaikh Abdullah thoroughly enjoyed the trip and realised the greatness and magnificence of the Capital of the British Empire. It is doubtful, however, whether his visitl | has not done more harm than good. He saw much of an unhealthy and demoralizing nature especially in Paris, and has come back with many wild Political ideas which he had not got before. Shaikh Abdullah returned from England on October 27th. At the suggestion of 'al Malika' Shaikh Abdullah's mother and only living wife of Shaikh Isa all the houses and huts of Bahrain were dressed with red and green flags for 6 days in his honour. III.

On 26th December 1919 the Politicu.1 Agent Major Dickson, C.I.E., made an exhaustive tour of the Island with the special view of enquiring into the state of the Islanders and the famine conditions brought about by the scarcity of rice : Much was learnt as a resultof the tour, and tha starving condition of the many villagers scattered over the Island was amply verified. Representations were made to the Deputy political Resident for an increase in the Bahrain allotment for 1#&amp;0 (rice;. It is to be hoped Govern ment of India will see its way to removing the restrictions on the export of rice from India at an early date. One realizes Governments measures are the result of necessity, but it is difficult to persuade a starving man that Government has other people to think of besides himself. BIB SaUD . (a) During the early and middle part of It19 re lations between Bin £&gt;aud and the Shareef Hussain were very strained. Matters came to a head in the vicinity of Khurma and Tarabah, which places were attacked and occupied by the Amir Ali the Shareef^ son, but were as promptly recaptured by the forces of Bin 3aud with the destruction of the entire forces of Ali. Bin Saud was ordered by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad to return to Riyadh at cjpe on pain of having his subsidy stopped. He promptly complied and explained the whole situation in a series of lengthy reports* His explanation was accepted by His Majesty’s Government and matters have been temporarily settled. In the meantime the trouble between Bin Saud and the Shareef is engaging the careful attention of His Majesty’s Government* Unless a modus vivendi acceptable to both parties is found before the Haj season, fighting will break out again. (b). Shaikh Faisal bin Abdul Aziz bin Saud son of the Ruler of JSajd arrived in Bahrain on August 17th and proceeded to England on August BOth as a guest of His Majesty’s Government. He was accompanied by Major H.E.Bowman. The party arrived in London on 13th October 1919 and were received by His Majesty the Ming in Buckingham Palace on 30th October 1919. On &amp;§th jfovember 1919 they attended a joint conference of India and Foreign Offices to discuss Arabian affairs. ( Bote . The party whortiy afterwards returned to Bahrain reaching Hassa on isth February 19L0 ) • (c). The safety of the Hassa Riyadh trade route was maintai n 9 ^maintainad during the year. This being entirely due to the splendid and remarkable work done by the Amir Bin Jaloui, cousin of Shaikh sir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman as Saud, and ruler of Hasaa and ( 4 atif • Bo praise is too high for the work done by this man and it is hoped His Hajesty^ Government will see its way to recognize the exceptional qualities of this man by a fitting rewan in the near future. (d)* The Akhwan . This movement is increasing rapidly, and in 1»1» has made great headway throughout Arabia. It is not the bad move of the Wahabis of a century ago. In nature it is simply a great revival of Religions belief among the ignorant Bedouin. It is being fostered and guided by the Amir of Bejd. Bin Saud who is far too able and clear sighted a ruler to allow the movement to awxwat* deteriorate into a fanitical and anti-European crusade. Bin Saud has the movement absolutely in hand and may be axpected to use it as a political rather than a religious weapon. The many stories and alarmist rumours re guarding the movement may be set aside as idle gossip. The Akhwan are the strong backbone and Pretorian guard so to speak of Bin Saud. They are soldiers rather than priests. The round- heads of a modern Coomwell. (e) . Bin Saud recently lodged a formal complaint against Shaikh Isa of Bahrain charging 5 per cent on goods passing through Bahrain en route for Nejd. He contends such goods should pay no duty to the Shaikh of Bahrain as they are neither consigned to nor are intended for Bahrain. The matter has been referred to Higher authority and is now under consideration. (f) . Jurisdiction over subjects of Bin Saud whilst on a visit to, or resident in Bahrain . Bin Saud has recently raised this question also. He is very anxious that all his Subjects should be considered as under the British Agency’s protection whilst in Bahrain. His desire has been strengthened recently owing to the fact coming to light of several cases of 'Zulum' towards his Subjects. / (g) . Opening up of Ojair and Jubail Harbours on the mainlandof Hassu as ports to serve Hejd, passim and Hassa. Bin Saud has intimated to the political Agent that he was anxious to tale the above work in hand and officially asked His Majesty’s Government that they try and get the British India Steam Navigation Company to run a steamer at once to Ojair, and later on another to Jubail. The above matter has not yet gone beyond the initial stages. It is hoped that the Deputy Political Resident will shortly visit OJair, Ras Tanurah, and Jubail with the political Agent Bahrain, when it will be possible to decide on the merits of each as the future harbour and port of Nejd. VI. (AaTaR . Friendly correspondence on minor matters and giving of news has been kept up with Shaikh Abdullah bin J-sim ath Thani*.§ Shaikh Abdullah was Gazetted C.I.k., on June'3rd, ifli. VII. CUSTOMS BAHRaIN . (a) Rao Sahib Tirathdas MaharaJ, late Director of Customs Bahrain, headman of the Hindu Community in Bahrain and Brahmin Community in Karachi died of diabetes at Karachi. He had greatly assisted the Agency in putting stop to smuggling of food-stuffs to Tangistan coast during the blockade and was especially thanked by the Deputy political Resident Colonel A. P* Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.i., for good work. Bahrain Customs could ill-afford to loss the services of such valuable and devoted Officer and Shaikh Isa still feels his loss. (b). The cash deposit system has worked well during IfIf. The object for which it was originally instituted having ceased to exist a movement headed by Shaikh Isa of Bahrain was started at the end of Iflf for its abolition. ( Not e. In March 1.-20 the Deputy political Resident approved of the system being done away with)• VIII. BAHR-tili* THaJm , . For full report under this head see 'Bahrain Trade report' for iflf. Generally speaking Bahrain trade was satisfactory during Iflf. The chief handicap was the lack of s shipping and the want of specie to pay for pearls and divers generally. / 1X» SHIPPING . The upward mails have been calling very regularly,Xi but the down mail i.e. from B^arah and Bushire may ba said to hava oeaaed to exist. The very greatest inoonvenienoe and delay has been caused to officials and merchants not to mention the great loss of trade that has resulted owing to merchants being unable to get away to India. iUAODHUMS. Owing to the hopelessly bad state of the mail service from Baghdad and Bushire application was made to the Civil commissioner for premission to lay out an aeroplane landing ground in Bahrain* It is hoped that the civil Coiimiiss— ioner will approve the measure. MUHICIPAL SaKIIaIIcK . This shows no improvement in fact the contfcayyis the oawe* The political Agent is working out a simple but fair scheme for taxing the town of Manama on the principles in force in the various towns in Meaopotamia. It is hoped that the scheme will be ready early in 12C0 and that Shaikh Isa will be persuaded to sanction its being put into foroe. XII.

During the period Khan Sahib Siddiq Hasan was in charge, work was carried on efficiently. XVII. JUPIClaL . The following number of cases were dealt with during lilt. Civil suits 2§0 Criminal 112* The Bahrain Order-in-Council came into force with effect i from 3rd February lilt. As a result certain changes in pro cedure were introduced. (1) The Joint Court, consisting of the political Agent or his Indian Assistant and a representative of Shaikh Isa the Ruler. This Court now sits in the upper room of the Shaikh’s Customs House, Manama. On each Wednesday cases in which one party is a British or protected subject and the other a Bahrain Subject are tried. A large number of oases mere satisfactorily settled during IfIf by this Court in spite of the fact that more often than not the Shaikh’s representative (especially Shaikh Abdullah, Shaikh Isa's youngest son) took up the cause of his Father’s subject t in approved advocate style. ' (2). The Majlis-al-Urfi, or the Court of representative merchantsmarchants of standing, for purpose of trying Mercantile Casas. This Court used to sit in the Agenoy prior to the enforcement of the order-in-Council• Today it also sits in the Customs House every Wednesday. For many months the Majlis-al-Urfi abstained from sitting owing to Shaikh Isa abusing his privileges and dismissing a member without consulting the political Agent. As Shaikh Isa refused to admit himself wrong the Political Agent in turn refused to allow the Court to meet vide para II above• The other Courts existing are: The Salifa Court - Judge Mahamed bin Fazil V The Qazi*s Court Shaikh iiasim bin Mehza The Salifat-al-Bahr (Marine Court) Judge Mubarak bin Hamad• During the year these Courts carried out the work expected of them fairly well. XVIII. CulM^Xa . Rainfall during 1$1* was up to the average. The heat as usual was terribly trying especially during the months of May,June, July and August. Captain Bray M.C. the late Political Agent found the heat too much for him, and probably his illness was aggravated by the fierce weather of /Hay and June. Bo rain guage or thermometer was kept in the Agenoy during ISiS. It is regretted therefore that no figures showing rainfall or temperature can be reported. This fault is being remedied, the necessary instruments have how been ordered* One of the most trying features of the Bahrain olimate is the dampness of the atmosphere. In summer of this makes a temperature/as low as t5°or §8° almost unbearable. added to the above is the extraordinary variation of temperature whioh changes as much as ^5'' to SO 0 within &lt;^4 hours. These sudden changes are mostly responsible for Bahraini bad epidemics of fever. XIY. MPIDAMIC ABD &lt;AUARABTlfla During the year under review Assistant Surgeon G.k.Monani, L.M.* S*, has been in charge of Quarantine andand town sanitation in addition to the iiedioal Charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital. Streneoue work was done during the influenaa epidemic, which commenced at about the beginning of November 1918 and ended in January 1**0. The epidemic passed over the towns of Manama, Muharraq and Hadd affecting almost every household to a greater or less extent. All the members of the A1 Khalifah family were affected with the disease including His Excellency Shaikh Isa. All of them were treated by Assistant Surgeon G.k.Monani. His Excellency the Shaikh was affected with Broiicho-Pnaumonia and his condition was orAif 1 iy'l and although he got over the illness with due oare, the convalascence was prolonged and left him very weak till the advent of spring. The whole epidemic was dealt with single-handed, the Mission Hospital being closed. Assistance was asked from Bushire but they could not spare anyone. This was also the year for the probable recurrence of Plague in Bahrain which comes on every alternate year. Before the probable season for the appearence of Plague every effort was made to get the heaps of rubbish cleared off from the bazaars and streets. A keen watoh was kept on the mortality of rats in housed and godowns cleaned up, and to get them disinfected with 3o8 gas whenever any dead rat was picked up from them. Anti-plague inoculation with prof. Haffkine's plague prophylastic was carried out. The whole of the dBAachment and such members of the Staff as were willing to inoculated in cluding Capt. x Mrs. Bray were inoculated against the disease. Fortunately for every one the period passed off without any recurrence of the disease. This was the first time since the first appearance of plague in Bahrain in 1»0* that the recurrence of the disease, which was usual every second year did not take place.

At first : haikh Isa refused to release the loan on the plea that he was from Qatar and domiciled in * Bahrain; but on further demand Shaikh Isa asked that he should be put in direct telegraphic communication with Government of India. It was pointed out that the Bahrain i Order in Council clearly laid down the proceedure in such oases 9 but if he wanted to aa e any representation to Government sane should be sent to Political Agent who would forward it to higher authorities as usual. Eventually rhaikh Isa released the Persian concerned and sent him to the Agency and ease was proceeded with in the ordinary way. (2) . In the second ouse a Shiah ^ahroni of village Slnabis ( four miles from Monamah ) a subject of Shaikh Isa, took refuge in the Agency as his house had been surrounded by the Fidawis of shaikh Abdullah bin Isa who had ordered the Bahrnni to produee a big and valuable pearl purchased from Qatlf# Shaikh Abdullah's avowed object in ordering the productionproduction wm* of this pearl wae to leYy a large amount as 2aka of royalty which ie customarily taken by the f hoikh on an unusually big pearl when ±m one iu found in the Bahrain Fieherie® or purciiaeed in Bahrain or it® territorial water®; while the Bahrani wa® afraid, in light of past experience of ®ome of hi® oole®, that once the pearl got out of hi® hand® it would never be returned by fhaikh Abdullah* He refused there fpre to take it to rhaikh Abdullah and shut himself up in his house, escaping at night when it was being surrounded by Fidawis with the object of taking the pearl forcibly* As a refugee he was allowed to stop in the Agency for the night and^ sent to llmikh Isa next morningwith a message that the Politico; Agent expected that he would not be wronged or persecuted, but treated in a juct imd honourable way* Chaikh Isa and his son ttmikh Abdullah were greatly chagrined, but left the Bahrani unmolested and he was enabled to take his pearl to Bombay for sale* (3)* Government 9 s decision on the four requeste made in London by rhaikh Abdullah on behalf of his father wae conveyed in June* As was to be expected each of the four requests was disallowed by Government as unreasonable and rhaikh Isa and his sons were extremely disappointed and showed their disappointment and irr/itation in a number of petty ways, chiefly by trying to persuade some of the ignorant foreigners to take their oases and complaints to rhaikh Xsa an his officials till at last the rhaikh wa® reminded of the decision that his Juriediction wa® limited to natives of Bahrain, while all foreigners including Arabs from the neighbouring districts were under the Political Agent 1 s Juriediction as British protected persons* Since then ( November ) there has been no more attempt of this kind on the part of Fhaikh Isa or his sons* (4)* A ftajdi woman apparently flying from her husband who threatenedthreatened to murder her for alleged saieoonduct, took refuge in the Agency* The Political Agent zt tried to hare her protects ed by the Do sari headman«of the village of Budayym vdiere her hueband lived; but ae the headman did not accept the re upon nihi lity, she was given a paper to ehow that ahe had nought protection of the Agency and her complaint wae to be enquired into, and forbidding any one to moleet her* She put up with eoma friends In Han&amp;mah wher&lt;3 her hueband found her and on the pretence of making a reconciliation entered her compartment and murdered her with a knife* The matter was reported to Shaikh / lea who refused to arrest the murderer and his friends and strongly objected to the Political Agent's action claiming that tho woman was one of his own subjcots and as such should not \ have been given protection etc:* Case was submitted to higher authorities* This gave rise to a petition which was prepared at the instigation of certain disaffected persons including Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa signed only by Arabs of Thiharraq and addressed to Eir Percy Cox* It purported to complain against the Political Agent, Hejor rickson for so-called hlgh-hlnded actions like building an .aerodrome and blocking a public road, starting a Municipality with consequent rates and curtailing their liberties etc; etc:* Shaikh Isa was lead to support the petition which he sent to the Resident with a letter in much thi same strain* (5)* At the instance of seme of his subjects bin Baud \ protested against the duty charged by Shaikh Isa on goods consigned to Haaa and qatlf and demanded a rebate* When this was pointed out to Shaikh Isa and a reasonable reduction suggested, he showed much irritation and refused to allow any reduction* The matter was submitted to Government and with some difficulty the rhaikh finally agreed to charge on such transit goods and Rs* 20/« per bale of piece-goods* This he also considers unfair and due to the instigations of TUM's ftoverMmenl Government* s representative* Assistant*Aeelet&amp;nt Surgeon sonant was in charge throughout the year* The nunber of canoe treated ae compared with the two previous i years are as follows- Year Indoors Outdoors Total 19 IP 30 6,870 5,900 19 19 55 6,78? 5,778 wo 64 4,73S 4,792 IV. THE POLITICAL AOEHT* e TOURf. On the 29th January the Political Agent left for Hassa via OJair, returning on 17th February after visiting Bln Saud i at hie own request* As the S.!*.*Bahrain' had not been repaired till then the Journey both woye vae performed In a Billing boat in spit© of the Shinnal. The Political Agent accompanied the Deputy Peeident in the P.X.M.S. # Lawarance*II to Qatar on 20th April returning on the 30th April after inverting Shaikh &lt; Abdullah bin Jaeln ath-Thani with the insignfc&amp; of C*I.S* Ae the •Lawrance* got aground lf37nedlately on arrival in Doha harbour it was not possible to land at Qatar and the Shaikh was Invested on Board* Qatlf was visited by the Political Agent f ilaJor Dickson,in September* The Political Agent accompanied Sir Percy Cox to meet Bin Saud in OJair on 25th returning on 29th Sep tember* V. BIN S1UP * Major H*R.P*Diokson,C*I.K. left for Haetia to meet Bin £aud on 29th January* He was accompanied by Mr.Tuslf bin Ahmad Kanoo,M*8*E* »and AMul A^ix Quasalbi, Bin Baud's agent in Bahrain. Bin Saud chiefly represented k hie troubles with the Pharlf of Uecoa arising out of the dispute over the districts of Khurma and Tarabah which had lead to constant friction,inter-tribla raids and mutualmutual incri**lnatlone on the part of these two chiefs, and expressed his fear of losing control over the Akhwan who had not been allowed to perform the pilgrimage and were threatning to do so by force* lie also asked for an enhanced subsidy to help him to meet the increoeed ex penditure incurred In keeping the border tribee under control and ensuring peace in control Arabia as also for paying off a heavy debt contracted by him during the war. Bin Baud, further, requested Government to arbitrate in the matter of Khurmah and Tarahah. As roeult of these appeals,Bin Baud’s subsidy of f 5,000/-, which was going to be dlflcontinued or reduced by one half, was continued. The Bharif was moved to agree to a personal meeting with Bin Baud who eventually consented to go with a limited, following, perform the Hajj &gt;\nd then meet the Siharif at Taif or Ball with a view to essaying a friendly settlement Bin Baud aeked that an Indian Itiuelia Officer be sent with him and Khan Sahib Syed Siddiq Hasean Indian Assistant, Bahrain, was deputed. In the meantime,Bin Baud changed his mind on the plea of being unable to go with so small a following as Government had advised, at the Sharif’s request, he was at last persuaded to send hie cousin Ahmad Thanalyan as-Saud with only 40 Nejdis. After the HajJ, a preliminary agreement was clgned in Mecca on 4th September by which both sides undertook to close all hostilities, tribal raids or agitation, and to endeavour re-establish friendly relations between . e.i i *- Kejax pending the final settlement of the disputed areae of Kfcurma and Tarabah etc to be made under the aafricea of H.B.M’e.Government• Bin Baud has also had trouble with three other neighbouring chiefs, Ibn Kashid, Ibn Babah of :.oweit and Ibn ’Aayidah of ’Aesir. The causes or motives, in each case, were similar namely,the growing strength of the fanaticalfanatical Akfcwon movaraent In Kajd and Bin Saud'e half- ooncealed ambition* to eubjugate the whole or greater port of Arabian Penineulo, which avowedly curtailed only by hie desire to rerpect his treaty obligation!? with the British Government whose friendship he cherishes above all. He not infrequently writes to the Political Agent and High Commissioner Baghdad that if Government can not help him to solve hie Political and Financial difficulties he should be told so, and then he *ould sweep away all hie enemies for whom he is more than a matoh. The Akhwan, who now comprise all the Hejds,’Hadhar* and •Badu* to gether with a large number of Heja* border tribes freshly won over partly by proselytizing, partly by subsidising, have during July to September laet succeeded in over running ABsir and taking Kbha the ruler Mohammed bln Yiayidh having been brought away to Riyadh where he is still a prisoner. The •xpedition against Ibn Rashid and Shammar in May-June 19P0 was lead by Bln Suad'e eldest son Baud and was lees successful# A severe fight took place in which both sides olaimed victory. Bin Saud f s losses were,however, said to be comparatively small and a booty of two thousand camels was secured by Baud# Another force employed during the same operation however received a considerable set back. In the third case of Kowelt,there was fighting at Fafah and Jahrah where the Akhwan under Faieal-ad- Dawish had eome initial success,but eventually loey ^ heavily and retired on being warned by Government by means of a communique dropped from an aeroplane that any attack or advance on Koweit would be oppooed by Brltl. Bh forces.
