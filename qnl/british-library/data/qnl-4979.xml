Origi na l /b in file Mo /ol Noby Resident, On the two occasions when I dis cussed the question of the occupation of Zaora by the Sudan tribe protected by Abu Dhabi, with the Chief of Sharcp he informed me that nothing could in duce him to allow Abu Dhabi to have anythina to do with this placet ufrich he said was Shargah territory. He said that the occupati on of Zaora by a t^ibe protected by and subservienv to Abu Dhabi would be a constant menace to Shargah and he wafi resolved to oppose it by force of a 7 ^* It iocs on this account chat I had to of Abu Dhabi permission visions by sea to Zaora, as I was assured that a breach of she peace would be the consequence of Abu Dhabi 's interference in the affair It now appears th Ch.ief Shargah i* willing jections with regard to the occupation of Zaora and has a ance in the matter buildings there, in return for help from the Abu Dhabi Chief to prevent the Chief of Debai affairs of Fujei rah. _ If therefore the Chief of Sharga* ^ the Chief of Ajman who I understand ha s also rights over Zaora are both agreed to the occupation of the P ace by a tribe protected by the Ch.ief of Ab u Dhabi there u&gt;ould see. to be no particular reason for ^ !/ /&gt;/ f t v*' x in the MCLvi6T m » Qn the other hard it is most advisable that the Chief of Sharga the position well and not take any action which he my have reason to regret here after, So far as the affairs of Fujeirah go, I do not believe that the Chief of Dehai contemplated any interference• He was warned hy me that he had no concern in the dispute between Shargah and Fujei.rah, and I understood from him that he had no intention to interfere except in the interests of peace. The quarrel between Sfoargah and uujeirah should be one that will he easy of settlement if the Shargah Chief acts with tact and tolerance. When the P.A.Ktuscat visited Bus hi re recently, I explained to him the position of Fujeirah with regard to Shargah and he intended to visit Fujeirah, and promised to explain the position to the local Sheikh and. inform him that he must not expect any assistance in counten ance of his disobedience to the lawful authority of Shargah, As therefore the affairs of Fujeirah seem to be in a fair way to a settlement and Debai is hardly likely to interfere, it seems to me that it will be a great pity if Shargah takes any steps which may cause an esvrangement between Debai and Abu Dhabi and which may lead to subsequent difficulties at Shargah itself. It will be as well that Mr Gas kin should visit Shargah as soon as possible and ascertain the actual position of affai rs.\t] affairs. He should explain my views to the Chief and hear what he has to Say*. He should also ascertain what view the Chief of Ajman takes in the matter. So far as I know the Chief of Ajman has certain rights with regard to Zaora, as it was his predecessor I understand, who originally agreed to the occupati on of Zaora by the Sudan tri be. Mr Gashin should also and aScercain if it Chief of Dehai contem ference in the affairs of Fujeirah. Hs should again warn him not to mix him self up in matters cern him.

The Commander of be requested to proc take Mr Gaskin on to such places on may wish to visit in accordance with the above di recti ens, A copy of this note should be sent to Mr Gaskin and the Zaora file and the Fujeirah file Mr Gaskin is well aware what our policy with regard to the Tracial Cmef is, namely not to their part which is a breach of the Maritime peace: we do no v prevent their areare ahmys ready to give our advice and assistance to bring settlement of their disputes,.

He also stated that the Sharga Chief is not popular with the tribes and expects thai; he will regret the results of his present policy.c ?

Sheikh Zaid is an ambitious person and has been trying to obtain pcoer over the other trucial Chiefs who are fully aware of his designs and have from time to time come to a mutual under standing for the purpose of frustrat ing him in his aims. The Sharga Sheikh it is evident has no claims to Zaora in which Himriyeh and Ajman alone are particularly interested and as the latter is resolved to oppose by force any encroachmeTits on that place by Sheikh Zaid and the action of Sheikh Zaid may endanger the maritime peace the Political Resident will probably prohibit the occupation of Zaora by an alien tribe subservient to Sheikh Zaid the Sharga Sheikh calculated that he will never be called upon to fulfil his promise to Sheikh Zaid regarding Zaora. I gathered from th the Sheikh of Sharga tions other than those already report ed by the Residency between him and the Thabi and I learnt from the Residency Agent that recently he was byvU by the latcer Chief w cal Resident will object to the occupa tion of Zaora by the Soudan but the Agent g^ve him no reply- It fore that no irmediate movement is con- tamplated and Sheikh Zaid is waiting to see what action the Political 'Resident is likely to take in the matter before he decides upon what he will do and I am of opinion that he is not prepared to fight for the sake of establishing the Sudan tribe at Zaora. There is no doubt that the presence of a tribe at Zaora protected by the Sheikh of Abu Thabi will be a source of danger to the neighbouring Chiefs and a menace to the tranquility of the Arab Coast generally* Sheikh Zaid is .accused of having designs on Breimi from which place he will be in a position to dominate the trucial Chiefs if he has adherents in a central position like Zacra on the Coast and I am inclined to think that he is not so loyal to our Government as the other Chiefs and under there circumstances it may be advisable to prohibit him carrying out his inten tions as regards Zaora.from To Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Hume id, Chief of Ajman.

How any disturbances take place when the British Government was mediating (in the matter It is not presumed that any of the Ohiefs of Arab Coast had the power to appose the wishes and orders of Government. But at present it is said by all the Chiefs that they have power to oppose (the Government) in what is not according to their desire and that the British Government wishes to meet their desire in any way. Owing to the refusal of the neighbours of Zaora to permit its being populated and occupied by Sultan bin Naser, a be lief has grown among the Arabs that the Government will do nothing without their consent.

My dear Major, In tri la Agency Tiary the week ending 12-tli October 1006, i made mention of a Sudan ShaiKH, named Sultan in -&lt; -i.-ix', who lived with a portion of his tribe at Bida; and m repeating the entry in the Residency Diary your office added a parenthesis that this Shaihh was the individual who had recently wished to settle at Zora. In January 1008, I consulted you on the subject of a request made by this same Headman of Bida for British Protec- tion, and you wrote a Minute on the Bahrein Agency file, re peating what now proves to be a mistake. Mr Inam al Hak, tlie Interpreijer of uh.is Agency has re ported to me that, when in Dabai last January, he met Shaildi Sultan bin Nasir as Suwaidi, the father-in-law of Shaikh Zaid bin Khalifa of Abu Thabi, and discovered that he was not the same person as the man of Bida, but a cousin. The Bida man is believed to have once attempted to set tle at Odaid under Shaikh Jasim bin Thani's overlordship, and contrary to the wishes of Shaikh Zaid, while the Dabai man as you know is on very friendly terms with the Chief of Abu Dhab i. I am enclosing copies of the papers which I showed you last January for your file, and perhaps you will find it desirable to get corrected the mistaken remarks which have previously occurred on your files regarding the identity of these 2 Shaikhs. -The strangeness of the coincidence in names is increased by the fact that both the Sultans have brothers named Khalifa.
