As a TJar measure we have been holding First Aid class on the lines of the St. John’s Ambulance Association and Oreenway^at my direction^, wrote to the Association for books and examination papers as we ra/ther thought we would like to take the examination for the St. John’s Ambulance Certificate. G-reenway has received a letter, a copy of which I enclose,suggesting the formation of a Local Centre for the Gulf at Kuwait. I shall be glad of your views - if there is to be a Centre it could be at_Bahrain or Kuwait it matters little which and one Centre should be enough for both places. Perhaps Hay should be President or Chairman or whatever it is o but he is remote in Bushire?Copy of letter No.7/Adm., dated the 16th hay, 1942 , t from the G-eneral Secretary, St. John Ambulance Association, New Delhi to Dr. A.L. Dreenmy, Kuwait. Dr, Rishworth, Honorary Secretary of our Bombay Provincial Centre, has for arded to us a copy of your letter dated the 12th April, 1942, to Major^Deather, from which we are glad to know that you have Started. First Aid lectures at Kuwait. I send, herewith, a copy^of the Regulations for the formation, instruction and examination of such classes in which you will find complete information on the subject. The books and equip ment required for the instruction of candidates may be obtained on payment from the Superintendent, St. John Ambulance Stores Depot, 20, Talkatora Road, New Delhi. A copy of the price list is sent herewith. I find from your letter to Major Deatker that you require 14 First Aid books which are being sent to you by our Depot Superintendent separately. If you have already obtained the books from any other source, these may kindly be returned. As attendance at six out of eight lectures is an essential condition for examination, 4 copies of the class attendance sheet, on which the roll of the class should be maintained, are sent herewith. Khen the class has completed a course of instruction, the examination should be conducted by a qualified doctor other than the lecturer in apeordance with the regulations. Four copies of the examination report form which should be filled in according to the instructions printed on the cover of the forms are also enclosed. On receipt of one copy each of the class attendance sheet and examination report duly completed we shall issue certificates for successful candidates. Each certificate costs eight annas plus annas 4. for the packing and postage of about 20 certificates which may be recovered from the candidates. If you think that there is scope for organisation of classes in First Aid, Home Nursing etc. regularly in Kuwait a nd other stations in Persian dull, and the Political Agent agrees, we would welcome the formation of a^Local Centre of the St. John xlmbulance Association for the Persian Oulf Agency, with the Political Agent as President and his Surgeon as Honorary^ Secretary. I shall be glad if you will discuss this suggestion with the Political Agent and if he approves of it. a formal application for the establishment of a Centre of the Association may be submitted to this (office on the prescribed form of which two copies are sent herewith. A copy of our last Annual Report is also sent herewith for your information.Personal, D.O.No. //AS The Agency, Bahrain, the 25th June 1942, ill you please refer to your Personal letter of June 12th about starting a local Gulf centre of the St, John’s Ambu lance Association, 2, Here the Bahrain Government Medical Officer, Dr. Snow, has been using the St. John’s Ambulance course of lectures as a basis for his lectures to First Aid personnel who are being trained in connection with A.R.P. To get a proper centre going here, with European ladies attending lectures and taking the examination, would hardly be possible in the Summer; but should be practicable during winter months. 3, If the centre is going to be for the Gulf I think the Resident should be President. But obviously the administration cannot be done from Bushire as communications from there are so bad. I suggest, therefore, that the administration should be done from Kuwait, with Greenway as Hon. Secretary, and Yourself deputising for the President. Bahrain could be a sub-centre with our Agency Surgeon here as Local Secretary. Really, I suppose, Bahrain should be the Centre for the Gulf both because of its central geographical position and because of its very favourable situation in regard to communications. But, at the moment, with the weather we are having, with my inadequate office staff, and with so many urgent problems to deal with, I don't feel like assuming any additional burdens or responsibilities'. / 4. Major T, Hickinbotham, O.B.E., Political Agent, Kuwait4# If Kuwait is the centre, and you dictate policy on behalf of the President, Dr* Steele can do most of the work here: which would suit me very well. 5* I should add, perhaps, that I think the scheme an excellent one, and very necessary. And I think we might get good work done in Bahrain during *ohe winter months when my wife (who has already taken the course and got her certificate) could sponsor the scheme in the suburbs of Awali while the Adviser* s wife could push it in Belgravia. Yours sincerely,-36/23. Political Agency, Bahrain, 21st June 1944. To The Secretary to the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. MEMORANDUM • When I was in Kuwait I suggested that a St. John*s Ambulence Centre should be started in the Persian Gulf. Has the idea been dropped or is any action contemplated? Political Agent, Bahrain.The Central Joint War Organization Indian Red Cross and St. John has decided to form an Indian Red Cross Welfare Service to be recruited from British and Indian ladies. 2 . It is emphasized that the new service is not intended in any way to replace the activities of members of the W. V. S. Indeed the main purpose of the new service is to obtain better co-ordination and to undertake work beyond the capacity and range of part-time voluntary workers. Welfare work amongst the sick and wounded is bound to increase enormously in scope and it is felt there is ample room for both voluntary and paid workers the latter supplementing the former. ^■4* The Indian Red Cross Welfare Service will undertake the following dut. in British and Indian Military Hospitals:— Handicrafts Red Cross storekeeping Libraries Letters or messages to relative Enquiries from relatives Postal and Shopping Services Searching (/.e. T racing of missing soldiers by interrogation of wounded comrades) Kitchen superintendence^may also be undertaken at the request of the military authorities. 4. Status. Members of the new service will be given “officer” status (though there will be no badges of rank). The service will be civilian in character, though members attached to military hospitals must observe military discipline and will be under the orders of the Commanding Officer, hi operational areas members posted to hospitals will be under military law * 5. Designation of Unit. The new unit will be designated “Indian Rf-rl Cross Welfare Service.” 0. Organisation. There will be two categories of workers:— (i) Full-time general service ; ^(ii) Full-time local service. A new Welfare Section is being formed at Joint War Organisation Head* quarters which will co-ordinate all Red Cross Welfare activities. Local workers will be organised in Provincial and State “sections” vvith local secretaries. 7. Scope of duties. Members of the Service posted to any hospital will be required to perform any or all of the duties indicated in para. 3 above. ]'2 8. Terms of Service.

The age limit will ordmanly be 25-45. {b) Local members will be ladies who engage for full-time service in one station. (c) Engagement for general and local service will be for the duration of the war, provided that after completion of one year’s engage ment the service of a general service worker may at any time be terminated by either party on presentation of two months’ jjrior notice in writing.

Provided that the Red Cross Commissioner shall have the right at any time to dispense with the services of any member who may be guilty of misconduct or who shall in any respect become unfit for service (otherwise than through illness or unavoidable accident) of which misconduct or unfitness the Red Cross Commissioner shall be the sole judge. There shall be a right of appeal to the Committee against a finding of misconduct or unfitness. An application for discharge by a member, on compassionate grounds, at any period of her service, will be considered on its merits by the Red Cross Commissioner. In the event of acceptance he will fix the terms of discharge. (&lt;j) The first three months of general and local service will be regarded as probationary. During the three months probationary period a candidate’s service may be terminated by the Red Cross Commissioner at any time without notice.
