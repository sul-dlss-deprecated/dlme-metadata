Much of the correspondence is between British officials but the file also contains copies - in both English and Arabic - of correspondence directly between Mubārak and British officials.The correspondence discusses tensions between Mubārak and the Ottoman authorities in Basra regarding his ownership of land surrounding a military fort in Fao and British attempts to mediate in this disagreement. A sketch map of this land is contained in the file on folio 177.On folio 51 the file contains a copy - in Arabic - of a settlement agreed between Mubārak and his relatives regarding ownership of properties in Fao. The settlement was registered at the British Consulate in Bussora [Basra] 8 January 1908.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c9#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
