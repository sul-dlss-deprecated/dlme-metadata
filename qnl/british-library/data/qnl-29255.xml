Views of the Political Resident Bahrain on Persian Gulf Lighting Service as set out in his Savingrams Nos.14 (of 24th April) and 25 (of 1st May) and in his letter 33/04 of 30th April to Burrows at Foreign Office have been put to Shipping Adviser who has been in Calcutta. 2. After careful consideration Shipping Adviser can see no useful purpose in his meeting Dredge in Bombay at present. His view is that, when agreed, proposals of H.M.G. for future set up of the P.G.L.S. should be put to the present Advisory Committ^e in Bombay and their observations obtained before further meeting can serve any useful purpose. 3. Shipping Adviser would be inclined to ask the Government of India to agree to postpone the transfer until the future set-up is decided but if Political Resident is anxious to taka, over by 1st June there is no obstacle on the Indian side. Dredge can go to Bombay and take over the administration. The funds and the records from Logsdail and the Accountant General any time after 20th May without Shipping Adviser assistance# Deputy High Commissioner could easily arrange a meeting for the handover-. This seems a matter for a dicision between you and Political Resident. You will no doubt indicate your views to^him. (4) On *(4) On the future set-up Shipping has no important divergence of view from the- Political Resident except for the appointment of a full time Inspector and on that point he emphasises that his idea was not only to provide Political Resident 'with technical advise for which he still feels the naval officers available might pro-y inadequate but also to implement the consideration put forward in paragraph six of his note'enclosed with Selby’s letter to Harrison 48/CS/t8 of 12th A£ril* He is convinced that suggested nominee would not leave his present job for a six months contract* On Chairmanship and membership of new committee he sees.no objection to Political Resident’s Suggestion* 5* Procedure envisaged in paragraph 2 above will inevitably involve delay in final settlement of this question beyond 1st June which was of course target date suggested for handover when the 1st April was abandoned* Although Government of India will probably agree to continue to administer service until our arrangements are complete and early ruling on the future set-up is is none the less desirable* (6) SLsase see my telegram No*KXSC 102 to Political Resident (1458 to you). . .

I have been asked for my proposals (a) regarding the actual taking over of funds from the Indian Government (b) their future investment and (d) [sic] arrangements to be mode for accounting. I find it difficult to give any very definite opinion about these matters until my representative has had an opportunity of visiting Bombay and studying the present procedure c.f. paragraph 3 of my Savingram quoted above. The only suggestion I con make at present is that any funds in current account should be transferred to a special “Persian Gulf Lighting Service” Recount to be opened with the Eastern Bank Bahrein and that the Reserve Bank of India’s permission should if necessary be obtained for this transfer. If any of the fund's assets in India have been invested in securities I con only make recommenda tions after I have been informed of the details. I will also make proposals about accounting when I have been informed or the present system. with effect-from the 1st — June, if transfer actually takes place on that date the Director General Ports and Navigation Basra should be instructed to make all remittances through this Residency to the Eastern Bank Bahrein and one or more officers of this Residency should be authorised to operate on Persian Gulf Lighting Service funds deposited in that Bank. sssss^tLosJcfc^S te. ■ Kfr^-Jf^ ’ FILE COPY Foreign Office, *&gt; 0 *' , 194? . 8 35101 —i&amp; (3) ; &gt;i»-&lt;cXED &gt;..• 't:'.

In my, op irvion • the'Senior ‘Naval Officer should ordinarily be regarded as the technical adviser of the political Resident but in his absence the latter can always* obtain advice from the‘next most senior Naval Officer present on; the.spotc or from the Port Director Basra and his staff* . . * f ; i • if * • Refer ence p aragraph 8 : Lam doubtful if there is any necessity for the appointment of am expensive full-time technical official. The matter however would be one for the Advisory Committee to consider and for His iviajesty's Government to decide full regard being had to the financial aspect of the proposal. If however the present Secretary of the Advisory Committee is willing to accept an appointment of this nature for 6 months during the transition period I consider we should avail ourselves of his services. At the end of the period it could be decided whether he should be retained on a more permanent basis. Reference paragraph 9 : I have already recommended that the Political Resident should not be Chairman of the new Committee but that he should only be represented, probably by his Secretary. I consider that the Senior Naval Officer should be ex officio Chairman and that if he is unable to attend a meeting he should depute either another Naval Officer /or the Director-GeneralFrom gahreia to Foreign Office No, 14 Saving - 2 - or the Director-General of Forts and Navigation or a member of the latter's staff to act in his place. Similarly I am doubtful if it is necessary for the Director-General of Ports and Navigation Basra to be present St all meetings and it should be left open to. him to appoint one of his subordinates to represent him.. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie should be represented both on their own account and on behalf of Lloyds and the British India Steam Navigation Company and Frank C.

As you will see he has put forward some valuable proposals which the Ministiy of Transport will no doubt wish to consider in detail. We trust that it will be possible to let us have a decision on^issues raised at a fairly early date* For the time being we are taking no action on your telegram No*1125 of_the 3rd April which authorises us to propose formally to the Government of India that the transfer should be postponed until the 1st June. We would prefer not to make this proposal formally until we are rather more sure that we shall be in a position to give effect to it on our side* 2* I am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosure to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who will, no doubt, send you his views on the matter as soon as possible. Owing to the fact that no bag facilities exist between here and Bahrein, paragraph 6 of the enclosure has, for obvious reasons, been omitted from the copy which we are sending to Bahrein* A separate copy of the paragraph 6 is being addressed to the Political Resident via London by bag. v ^ ' ® 4 Pj) in Ihis letter for Miss Churchard at „the Ministry at the Foreign Office* Yours sincerely. 3* I enclose spare copies of Transport and for B*A*B* (R.W.

The PoliticML Resident, Persian Gulf, was unable to send a representative to the proposed UiCeting in DoaLay on 27th March* Finding it convenient however, to visit Bombay from 26th March to 1st April, I took the opportunity of having informal talks on the subject with the Secretary of the present Advisory Committee, and vdth the following members of the Committee; A* Bo Finney, C,F, Morris, JAMES FMHiAY &amp; CO. (representing the Bcobay Chamber of Commerce*) 2. On my recam.-endation, action was at once taken in Dellii to maintain the status quo for the time being, as reported in Delhi telegram 795 to C.P.O. date' 31st March* 3. The position now seems to be that everything is tied up on the Indian Government’s dide of the problem* They are ready to hand over the administration funds and records to II.M.G’s nominee as soon as we wish* It remains for us to formulate a practical plan for the future administration of the Service under the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, which will be acceptable to the Foreign Office and Ministry of Transport and to the ship-owners, for whose sake the Service exists. 4* At the moment the practical work of the Service is divided between Bombay and Basra. A full-time clerical assistant is employed in the Office of the Secretary of the Advisory Committee at Bombay to handle establishment questions, e.g., the payment of wages to tire 36 Indian and 7 Iraqi employees, remittances to families in India, passages and passports for leave travel, payments to 8 or 9 Indian pensioners, etc 0 (this is the offical not the Secretary of the Ccxnmittee, as reported in telegram 795 to C.R.O., who is unwilling to serve in Bahrein). Accounts have been kapt by the Government of India’s Accountant General in Bombay and the Direct or General of Ports and Navigation, Basra, undertakes the inspection and maintenance of the lights, supervision of stores, etc. 5 . All the work now done in Bombay will need to be transferred to Bahrein, and I suggest that a member of the Political Resident’s staff should spend a short period, say a v/eek, in the Bombay Office with the present staff before taking over. 6 . The Director General of Ports and Navigation, Basra, although at the moment he happens to be a British subject on loan from the U.K* on short-term contract, is the servant of a foreign government, and for this reason alone I suggest this is an appropriate moment to reduce his responsibility for the Service to a minimum, (there are also suggestions, which would no ' oubt be difficult to substantiate, that the Basra authorities in the past have found ways of getting much of their own work done at the expense of the P.G.L.S, fund).- 2 - 7* The P litical Resident, I take it, Iuxl no technic cl disposal on the spot on such subjects as navigation add, the naintenance of lighthouses, and as Caccia points out in his lettej froti '59Q8. advice cu nxs ir to the Foreign Office dated 24-th January , there are ol relying on the Senior Haval Officer, Persian Culf, for thispurpose* C, i am inclined to suggest therefore that the political Resident's ff should be ug ted hy a full-tn,ie technioal official, vdth some such title as 'Inspector of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, _ikR-i the Political Resident's direction he could, in fact, act as a general manager of the Service, ccLwining supor\ r ision of the administrative work and secretaryship of the Advisory Cam^ittee (which together occupy about one-third of the present Secretary *c time) with as much^ of th 0 eneral inspection ant management as can be conveniently transferred from Basra,' Such an official might be appointed either by the Foreign Office on the advice of tie ministry of Transport or by the ministry of Transport and attached to the Foreign Service, I have tried not to be influenced in making this recoimi.* ndation by the fact that tne present Secretary of the Advisory Committee would himself oe willing to consider an appointment of this kind at Bahrein on a short tenn contract (say three or five year’s).

Cadre it will be noted that they have no objection to continuing to serve under His Majesty's Government. One point to whicn I woul ^11 attention is that the staff is pensionable.

These figures are surprising in view of the statement of the Port telegram revenue exceeds normal expenditure c.f. par I 4 ? nnrier reference and he and his officers agree that there is almost certainly a serious error in the revenue estimate.

The Oil Companies at present operating in the Gulf area, viz., the Anglo Iranian Oil Company, the Kuwait Oil Company, Arabian American Oil Company, Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited should all be represented if they so desire. This Residency should also have the right to be represented by one of its officers. The Port Director has informed me that he sends monthly returns of revenue and expenditure to the Accountant General at Bombay and that the accounts are compiled by that officer. 8. The Port Director urged most strongly tnat H.M.G. should not forgo their claim to the whole of the assets of the Fund. Little or no expenditure of a , capital nature has been expended on the lighting and buoying of the Gulf during the war years and a large sum of money is now required to bring the existing lights and buoys up to a modern standard and to provide new ones where necessary to serve the greatly increased shipping which is now entering the Gulf. 9 # I am sending copies of this letter without its*enclosures to the Director-General of Ports and Navigation Basra and the United Kingdom High Commissioner in India.

SUBJECT - BUDGjii ^ — SERVICES FUND FOR THE YEAR 1948/49.

Riii / Ean UE. The revenue estimate has been shown as Is 311,690 based on the actuals for the four months ended 31/7/47 and probables for the current year, with dues reckoned at anna one per ton, (in and out) net registered tonnage excluding Admiralty tankers. EXPENDITURE. Estimates aggregate to IE 1,723,147. In estimating, present day conditions (i.e. general advance and decrease in prices of all materials) have been taken into consider ation. The estimated expenditure under salaries, stores, provisions, etc., has been framed in accordance with the scale sanctioned in the various government letters. I likewise enclose herewith an explanatory notes in respect of certain items of expenditure. 3d. DIRECTOR GENERAL N oe ports &amp; navigation.w P.G,L.3.

The Port Directo? at lafra is not in the Resident s opinion suitable as he is the servant of a foreign Government and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, is not suitable a 5 he l sn ?t static. Hence the conclusion that this authority should be vested in the Political Resident who should corresoond normally direct with the Ministry of Transport on all technical matters.

That is a matter for later consideration and discussion. ® As your minute made clear, the question of the division of the assets between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India is not one for settlement here. Finally, all concerned presume that the intention should be in the future as in the past to run the Service on a non-profit making basis to cover all costs including some provision for capital expenditure.

Although no reply has apparently yet been received to your letter of 8 th Octo ber last (Rxt.1921/47) t o the Government of India about the transfer of the financial assets of the Fund, we should see no objection to a reply that would be willing to assume administrative control with effect from the •1st April next, if this course is agreeable to other Departments concerned, but we should have preferred that all physical assets and monies standing to the credit of the Persian Gulf Light Fund should be transferred on that date. In the absence of a reply to your letter it is not certain that the Government of India will do this. There would be no question of direct administration by H.M.G. We assume that the Political Resident is satisfied that it will be possible for him to make all necessary local arrangements for the transfer to take place on the 1st April. Until it is known to what extent the Government of India will be prepared to hand over the accumulated funds, no large-scale scheme of improvements and additions to the lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf could be put in hand, though the sensible course would be to prepare the necessary plans in readiness.

' j/ .... Dear Sir, 3' Io*i3r; Persian Gulf Liprhting: Service, We have consulted the principal Companies interested in the subject matter of your letter of the 2$&gt;th November and beg to submit their views. As they are very much concerned with the impending changes in the administration of the Persian Gulf Lights it is hoped that full consideration will be given to these views and, if necessary, that a meeting may be arranged with you before final decisions are made. In the first place we are in full agreement with the proposal that responsibility for the control and administration of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service should be transferred to H.M.Government from the Government of India. It is extremely important, however, that when the transfer is made all physical assets and existing moneys standing to the credit of the Persian Gulf Light Fund shall be transferred to H.M. Government at the same time. It is understood that there is a very substantial balance, the result of contributions by British Companies and includirig contributions during the war by H.M.Government in respect of British transports and freight ships. It is certain that large sums will have to be expended on renewals and improvements whichhave been postponed for decision by the new administration and in any case there appears to be no justification whatever for any claim by the Indian Government to any portion of these funds or assets. It would appear to those with experience of the matter that, rather than the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, should be Chairman of the Advisory Committee, while the Port Director, Basra should continue to be responsible for maintaining the lights and buoys and should sit or be represented on the Advisory Committee. The Political Resident could nominate one of his officers to sit on the Advisory Conmittee. Basra is preferred to Bahrein as the principal meeting place for the Advisory Conmittee where the meetings could, if desirable, be held afloat on a British ship. It might well,however, be advisable in view of the growing tanker traffic for occasional or even alternate meetings to be held at Bahrein, It is considered that the only qualification for representation on the Advisory Comnittee should be a connection with a Shipping Company regularly .using the Gulf and contributing dues. On this basis it would not at present appear that any Indian Shipping Companies would qualify for representation. It is agreed that existing arrangements for the collection of dues needs revision. It is felt that no user of the Service should be exempted from paying dues and that all should contribute equally on a flat rate. The existing arrangements for collection by the Basra Port Directorate are adequate for shipping using the Shatt-al-Arab and similar collection arrangements, where it is practicable to institute them, are desirable elsewhere in the Gulf, e.g. at Bahrein and at Kuwait. In the case of ports in territory /whe reinCOPY PT/H. 813/46 25th November, 1947 I am directed by the Minister of Transport to state that he has had under consideration the question of the future administration of the Persian Guif Lighting Service consequent on constitutional changes in India. The services of lighting and buoying the Persian Gulf were originally undertaken by the British India Steam Navigation Company at their own expense, but in 1911 the lights and buoys were taken over by H.M. Government at a valuation and were maintained until 1925 by tfoe-~3oy the Royal Indian Marine, the cost being borne equally between British and Indian revenues. Since 1925, the Persian Gulf Lighting Service has been maintained on a self-supporting basis from dues levied on all vessels calling at Basra and Abadan, the Service being administered by the Nautical Adviser to the Government of India acting with the assistance of a non-officjaL Advisory Committee of Shipowners at Bombay. The Port Director, Basra, maintained the lights and buoys and collected the dues. It is understood that the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the Arabian-American Oil Company make annual payments to the Service, partly for the upkeep of certain buoys and beacons of their own and partly as a contribution towards the general expenditure of the Service. The following proposals for the future administration of the Service were promulgated by His Majesty^ Government and agreed to in principle by the Government of India (a) that His Majesty’s Government should take over from the Government of India the responsibility for the control and administration of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service; (b) that the Service should be placed under the supervision of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Advisory Committee in future should sit at Bahrein, provision being made for the representation on it of any Indian shipping interests and, if desirable p other commercial interests that may be concerned: Bahrein was proposed as it appeared the most suitable place for the location of the Advisory Committee in view of its central situation in the Persian Gulf, the facility of its communications and the comparative ease of arranging for the representation of Oil Companies operating in the Persian Gulf area. Recent developments have given rise to increasing oil tanker traffic which does not call at Basra or Abadan and the existing arrangements for the collection of dues and the contributions by the two Companies mentioned above may, therefore, need revision. Negotiations are proceeding with the Government of India on the question of the physical assets and finances of the Persian Gulx Light Fund.

Conunonaealth Belations, London No,53-S Dated, BAHRAIN, the 7th January, 1947. Reference correspondence resting^ with your endorsement No .Ext. 2916/47 dated 2.^rd December 1947 regarding lighting and buoying in the Persian uulf. Grateful if you could let me 2 . know whether His Majesty 1 s Government will take over the administration of the lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf with effect from the 1st April 1948 and if so whether the administration will be carried out by His Majesty’s Government direct or through this Ptesidency. 3 . A very urgent decision is required as it will take some time to effect the sri transfer and meanwhile little or nothing can be done in the way of improvements and additions to the lights and buoys and no progress can be made with the long pending question of the recovery of light dues from ships which do not enter the Shatt- al Arab. Sd/~ W.K. Hay, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. JAN 1948 / J Political Resident, Persian Gulf.1 2 JAN W48 /f H: Mr Russell Brown In a talk with me on the 29th of December referred to tht recent decision regarding the sea bed boundary between Bahrain and Qatar and said that from Kkxi the point of view of his Company he had only one criticism to make and that was that the North Sitra Buoy was not a suitable point on the boundary line as it was in the middle of the navigation channel and ships could pass on both sides of it. He suggested that it would have been preferable if the line had been taken direct to the Bahrain Light Vessel. He feared that although it was definitely stated that the sea bed 6hly was delimited, and that navigation rights were not affected, in the course of years the line prescribed might be taken also to delimit the waters and that the Qatar authorities would then ooject to the Company's ships passing on their % side of the buoy. I gathered from him that a similar question is likely to arise when the northern boundary of the Bahrain sea bed is delimited as Aramco are most anxious to retain exclusive rights over their main havigstlon channel in this area. Mr. Russell Brown stated that he was giving me his personal viev/s only ahd that he did not known whether his head office would have any other objections to raise. He added that from the general point of view he thought it was a mistake to allot the Libal ankJaradeh shoals to Bahrain and that it would have simplified matters if nothing had been allotted to Bahrain east of the boundary line in this area. ltd/- fc.H.

As Ras-al- Hadd is about 100 miles south west of Muscat, it is open to quest t ion whether the establishment of a light there is the concern of the Persian Gulf Lights Service. I would further observe that the establishment of a light at this place would be of no benefit to vessels proceeding from India to the Persian Gulf but would, on the other hand, benefit tankers many of whom do not pay any dues. In the present circumstances I do not think that this work should be undertaken until the payment of dues by all vessels entering the Gulf is enforced.

This because to obtain 15 miles range the light would need an elevation of some 90 feet and such a high, costly structure is to be avoided if possible.

I suggest that that officer should be consulted and would be glad to know if I may do this direct. 1 i»m no t acquainted with the details of the conditions of service of this staff but I believe that many of them have been employed for a long time. They are usecUfor manning lonely light-houses and light-ships and it is likely to be difficult to replace them. My provisional view is therefore that the present personnel should be retained if they are willing to continue in service. The question of replacing them by local Arabs or Baluchis might be considered as occasion arises but I think it will probably be desirable to continue to employ Indians. 3. Reference paragraph 2(b) of Government of India Express Letter No. D .275-A , Yr/47 of 23 rd Septembe r. I do not know exactly what work is performed by the office staff at Bombay.

His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regret that they would find it very difficult to agree that the assets of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Fund should, on the transfer of control of service, be divided in the way proposed by the Government of India. They can only regard the Fund as being in the nature not in any sense of an asset susceptible of such disposal, bu,t of a trust, v/hich should be administered accordingly by them, with the object of providing the services required by shipping using the Persian Gulf. The sums paid by them and by the Government of India for the maintenance of lighting service before the present Fund was established in 1925 might reasonably be regarded as the price for providing essential services to British and Indian shipping at that time. 3* As regards the Fund's present assets, it was understood from the former Government of India’s letter No.D.1225-BPG/47 that they j not accumulated to an extent that would more than cover the //expenditure necessary to effect essential improvements which could i not be carried out during the war. If in fact there were to be a surplus the shipping companies whose dues have gone to building up the Fund would clearly have a claim in any distribution of it. 4. .

The Government of India considered that the total assets should be equally divided between themselves and H.M.G. , the half shares coming to some 17 t lakhs of rupees. If this were agreed to, it would place a heavy burden on H.M. G. and possibly on subscribers to the fund. The Foreign Office, have suggested in their letter of the 3rd September, that the best way to avoid such a division of assets is to endeavour to get the Government of India to agree to the P.G.L.S.

We agree with you that the Government of India’s reply is not satisfactory. It seems to us that the present assets of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service should be regarded as a trust and as belonging to neither the Government of India nor to His Majesty’s Government. On this basis the transfer of administrative control of the service from the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government would not imply any transfer of the fund’s assets to His Majesty’s Government who would simply see that the funds were used to provide the services required by the shipping using the Persian Gulf and no question of handing over part of the fund’s assets to the Government of India would arise. Sums paid by His Majesty’s Government and the Indian Government for the maintenance of the lighting service before the present fund was set up in 1925 would be regarded partly as the price of providing services to British and Indian shipping, and of serving the political aim of preserving our paramount position in the Persian Gulf. \ u Vv ^ ^ t • 1 Moreover/ E.P.

It is unlikely that tkl ® Adv ^. s ^ Committee who have already shown tnemselves somewhat restive at the way in which the fund has been administered would take at all kindly to a proposal that half the assets of the S e rvice should be handed over to the Government of India. We are quite ready to hold a meeting if you think it necessary, but you may think that the only action required at the moment is to tell the Government of India that we do ^ot like their proposal and to try to persuade the * to regard the Persian Gulf Lighting Service assets as a trust.

' indexe^^T Please refer to your letter Tif-24-st August addressed to Mr.Glenister about the proposal to establish a light on Ras-al-Hadd. R&amp;s-al-Hadd is the easternmost point point of Arabia, 90 miles south eastward of Muscat and 280 miles from the entrance to the Persian G-ulf. We are advised that there is undoubtedly a need for a light on this point, which must be rounded by all ships proceeding to the Persian Gulf from the Gulf of Aden and the coast of East Africa: it is also the point of landfall of vessels from India and the Par East. There are no lights on the Arabian Coast between Muscat and Aden, a stretch of nearly 1,200 miles, except for a small unreliable light at Makalla about 800 miles south westward of Ras-al-Hadd. We feel some difficulty, however, in entertaining the view that such a light should form part of the Persian Gulf Light Service. Although we are not aware that any precise limits of Jurisdiction have been fixed for the P#G*L*S., were that Service to establish and maintain a light at Has—al—Hadd their responsibilities would extend a further 90 miles to the south eastward and nearly 300 miles from the entrance to the Persian Gulf. This might create an awkward precedent, and should there be demands for other lights on the Arabian coast,which would also be only of assistance to the Persian Gulf traffic, the P.G.L.S. might be asked to bear Ihe cost of establishing and maintaining them. The relief of lighthouses in such isolated spots would, I Should imagine, prove both difficult and costly.

The Government of India agree that His Majesty’s Government should assume control of this service as part of the transfer of the Persian Gulf Adminis tration as a whole subject to an agreement on the division of assets. In regard to this last the Government of India are unable to accept the proposal in Paragraph 6 of your letter that the present assets of the Service should pass in toto to His Majesty’s Government with the transference of control. t 3. Steps are being taken to obtain a detailed * statement of the assets of the Service, both as regards equipment and cash. According to the Government of India’s present information, the Services existing assets consist of physical assets worth Rs.5,33,351/-, investments in securities of the face value of Rs. 23,07,700 and cash Rs.6,41,169 totalling Rs,34,32,220/-. In view of the facts that the cost of taking over the Service in 1911 from the B.T.S.N. Co: was shared between the Government of India and His Majesty’s * • * Government/1564 . I ■^o'/Grnue.'j.t,; the actual c^st of operation of the Service understood to have varied between £ 30,000/- and £ 40,000/- per annum - from then until 1925, when the oervice was placed on a self-supporting basis, was also equally shared between India and His Majesty T s Government: and finally that both the Government of India and His Majesty r s Government contributed £ 5,000/- per annum for 5 year^ iron 1925, to meet any possible deficit in the PeroicJi e-ulf Lighting Service Fund, the Government of India consider it only fair that they should receive some recompense for their share in building up the services present assets. They accordingly consider that the total assets should, on transfer of the Service, be equally divided between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, the Government of India thus receiving cash and securities (face value) to the extent of Rs.17,41,110/-, as half the value of the total assets, while His Majesty's Government receive the physical assets complete, and the balance of the other assets worth Rs.12,07,759. 4.

(1) They were unanimously of the opinion that it would be most satisfactory if H.M.G. would assume direct administrative control. It was recommended, however, that the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, should exercise supervision of the Lighting Service and not the Political Resident, mainly because of the navigational and technical knowledge required, but if considered necessary the political Resident could be represented on the new Advisory Committee, which it is assumed will be appointed when the transfer is effected. (2) Hitherto the proceedings of the Conmittee in Bombay have been much handicapped by the fact that a representative of the Port Directorate in Basrah, who it is presumed would continue to administer the lights on behalf oi n*. .L. has been unable to be present at Meetings, and this is considered to be a most important matter which should not be overlooked for the future if past mi sunder standard are to be avoided and necessary co-operation maintained. (3) It is not felt ttiat Bahrein is a suitable place for Meetings to be held. Only the American Oil Companies there are so far interested and they have not yet commenced to pay dues, whereas at the northern end of th f ^ ln n ^h 0n the representation of the Port Directorate which would thus be made^ possibie the attendance would also be assured at all meetings of representatives of the British TfinW fomoanv Anrlo-Saxon P.C., and other Tanker interests, B.I.&amp;.N. uo. hza., a^ desfrp’.cf Itrich * Co! Ltd. the vessels of vfcose fleets have always**!, the principal contribution to the Lights Fund, and still comprise y greatest tonnage using the Gulf Limits. (k) Assuming the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, undertook executive responsibilities as Chairman of the Committee, the suggestion was put forward that political difficulties which might otherwise arise could peihaps be oyorcorr. the Veetines being held on board his Ship, and in that event to suit the convenience of s^e of the members the meetings need not necessarily always be held in one place. (5) With regard to representation on the Committee, at a recent Meeting of -the Committee in Bombay, which was attended by representatives of the American Oil interests at Bahrein, they were informed that they would be entitled to representation as soin as^hey contributed to the Ughts Fund by payment^ dues on the same basis as other shipping using the Gulf, and this would, of cou , also apply to the shipping interests of India or any other Nations. (6) The Advisory.

Reference your letter No.306-M-III(5)/47, dated 29th March ? 1947 on the above subject. I have consulted the members of the P.G.L.S. Advisory Committee who represent the Shipping and Commercial interests concerned upon the contentsxis of the letter dated 4 th March, 47, (Ext.8529/47) from the Secretary of State for India to the Secretary to the Govt, of India, External Affairs Deptt. in connection with the future of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. (1) They were unanimously of the opinion that it would be most satisfactory if His Majesty's Government would assume direct administrative control. It was recommended however, that the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, shoul=d exercise supervision of the Lighting Service and not.the Political Resident, mainly because of the navigational and technical knowledge required, but if considered necessary the Political Resident could be represented on the New Advisory Committee, which it is assumed will be appointed when the transfer is effected. (2) Hitherto the proceedings of the Committee in Bombay have been much handicapped by the fact that a representative of the Port Directorate in Basrah, who it is presumed would continue to administer the lights on behalf of H.M.G.has been unable to be present at Meetings, and this is considered to be a most important matter which should not be overlooked for the future P^st misunderstandings are to be avoided and necessary cooperation maintained. (3) It is not felt that B a hre=in is a suitable place for Meetings to be held. Only the American Oil Companies there are so far interested and they have not yet commenced to pay dues, whereas at the northern end of the Gu^f, in addition to representation of the Port Directorate which would thus be made possible, the attendance would also be assured at all Meetings or representatives of the Anglo Iranian Oil Co., British Indian Steam Navigation Co.Ltd., and Messrs F.C. Strick &amp; Co. Ltd., and the vessels of which these three.companies have always made the princippl contribution to the Lights Fund, and still comprise by far the greater tonnage using the Gulf Lights. (4) Assuming the.Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, undertook executive responsibilities^ as Chairman of the the suggestion was put forv/ard that political difficulties which might otherwise arise could perhaps be overcome by the Meetings being held on board his ship, and in that event to suit the convenience of some of the members thex meetings need not necessarily always be held in one place. (5) With regard to representation on the Committee, at a recent Meeting of the Committee in Bombay, which was attended by representatives of the American Oil interests at Bahrein, they were informed that they would be entitled to representation as soon as they /contributedO') l . nn n tho bUted K° ^ he Lights by payment of dues thi^wnn^ ^ S1S 33 ° th f r shi PP ln g using the Gulf, and f °? urse &gt; also a PPly to the shipping interests of India or any other nations, (5) The Advisory Committee have not yet been :^ a i she ^ l'u th a Istailed statement of the present the P-G.L.S. but this is in course of preparation and will be submitted as soon as it has been approved by them.

Yours sincerely, ' S' P.A.K. Harrison, Hsq., India Office, London, S.W.l. CMB i i————— tS /; [96 The following are thernain points raised e in his letter of the 1st July, 1946 and comments thereon. (l) Irresoective of the merits of the administration by a British India Government, it might be inappropriate to extend the responsibility of an Independent Government. It was not desirable to take up with the Government of India the question of the Lighting Service in advance of the wider question of the transfer of political control in the Gulf. Proposals for the future administration of the Lighting Service were, however, forwardeo officially to the Government of India on the 4th March, 1947, auJ their comments are awaited. (2) Cash reserves were being built up to an undue extent and capital expenditure might be met from revenue with consequent serious detriment to the level of light dues. In January, 194, , the balance of the Reserve Funds were as follows Depreciation Reserve Fund Investment: Additions and Replacement Fund Investments: Surplus Revenue Fund Investment: Rupees 6,90,100-0-0 Rupees 4,64,600-0-0 Rupees 11,54,900-0-0 The Depreciation and the Additions an d Replacement Reserve Funds are maintained for the specific purpose of financing the cost of replacement of existing assets. The Service maintains 'three lightships, ten light houses and a large number of buoys and beacons, and having regard to the present abnormal price levels the Government of India does not consider that the available reserves in these Funds are excessive. The Surplus Reserve Fund.as its name implies, was made up of accomulations of surplus revenue in the pre-war years and the Fund was intended to provide for any depreciation of securities held by the Fund, for capital cost of new fixed assets and for any unforeseen contingencies arising from the obsolesence of existing assets due to new improvements or other causes. The question whether this Fund should or should not be allowed to accumulate was considered exhaustively in 1958 in consultation with the Advisory Committee in Bombay. At that time the amount available in the Fund stood at Rs. 7, 64, 7 80 which was roughly equal to the normal expenditure of ihe Lighting Dervice for two years. It was decided that this would be an adequate reserve against possible reduction in revenue owing to transfer of some of the lights to the Iranian Government and other contingencies, and that as the financial position of the Service was strong it was not necessary to allow the Fund to grow further. There ha^ been no additions to the Fund since then, except the interest earned by its investments, and actually the Service has been working at a loss during recent years. Plans for the improvement and modernisation of the ai&lt;^ to navigation in the Persian Gulf are under consideration by the Government of India but await the decision of the Persian Government regarding the arrangements for the maintenance of the lights in their territorial waters. The plans include the establishment of improved lights (attended and^unattended), and a chain of radio beacons and buoys. It is also proposed to make certain necessary replacements which coula not be effected during the War, and to purchase a light tender. It is not unlikely that the purchase of ihe tender will alone consume most of the available resources of the Surplus Reserve Fund. The Assets of the P.G.L.S, Fund in January, 1947, were:- /Buildings I •.x / 1 /- 2 - Buildings Lightvessels Lights &amp; Beacons Buoys Towers Works under Progress Paths &amp; Landings 1 ex '-Rs. 1,90,840-0-0 I Q 4,57,630-C-O I 7 2,39,5^0-0-0 i^vajo-o-o 1,15,500-0-0 7 , 630 - 0-0 43 , 628 - 0-0 Rs, 11,69,618-0-0 ■ -r-y ’ V’ 1 -* • It is doubtful whether the existing revenue of lig- lakhs would be sufficient to meet the expenditure on account of various post-war schemes such as the purchase of new lightvessels, buoys, beacons, re-organisation of shore establishment as Basrah, and tie acquioio of a new light tender. The Government of India are of opinion that there has been no excessive or unjustified accumulation of Reserves to the detriment of the facilities provided by the Service ( 3 ) There should he more comprehensive arrangements for the conection of dues, particularly to provide for dues on vessels trading to 3ahr in. The Bahrein Petroleum Company and the Arabian-American Oil Co. each make a total annual payment of £1,000 to the .service, P ar 7 for the’upkeep of certain buoys and beacons of their own a ' ^ y as a contribution towards the general expenditure of the Lighting Service In view of recent developments the present arrangements may not be altogether satisfactory and may need revision, out payment tne above mentioned contributions goes some waytowardsmeetingthe Tint that vessels to Bahrein should contribute to the oost of the Service The question of the. levying of dues on vessels which do n call at’Basrah and Abadan where the dues are at of should be considered with the new proposals for the future running the Service.

The explanations in the Government of India’s letter of 19th March seem reasonable on the face of it, but the justification for the accumulation of reserves mainly rests, of course, on the soundness of the programme of expenditure on new works and maintenance; on this we are not in a position to comment. As you know, the representations which led to the enquiry were made by Mr.Gillespie of iiie Anglo—Iranian Oil Company in his lattar of ta t July last of which you have had a copy. If there is no ob jection, I should like to pass on to Mr.Gillespie the substance of the Government of India’s letter as it answers the points he raised in the third and fourth paragraphs of his letter and he may be able to comment usefully on the explanations offered by the Government of India.

' The original proposal made to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, by American shipping interests was that the Stiffe Bank Lightvessel should be moved to the Shah Allum Shoal but the proposal was not favoured tSj^the-Port Directorate Basra, as the difficulties involved in mooring the lightvessel safely on the Shoal were very considerable and success was problematical. Subsequently it was suggested by the S.N.O. in August 1946 that the Stiffe Bank lightvessel should be shifted to Cable Bank as he thought that it would serve the Shat^Hl Arab traffic equally well in the new position and would also give better and safer service to the traflc bound for Bahrain and Has Tanura: it was however later reported by the Political Resident that the new S.N.O. did not favour moving the lightvessel until a switch was establish- ed on Jezirat Shuab which was in Persian territory. 3 / 2ircumstahces it was ervice Cominittee 3. After a consideration of all t recommended by the Persian Gulf Lighting chat the lightvessel should be retained on Stiffe Bank f tha.c a new lightfloat should be placed on the Cable Bank and that aa a further light should be placed over the •depression’ in the Shah Allum Shoal after a hydrographic survey was made co avoid the risk of its ’dragging'. These proposals were approved by the Government of India in January laat. 4. The question of lighting the Shah Allum bhoal has now been raised again by the Persian Gulf Lighting bervice Committee at the instance of the United States Maritime Commission Representative in Bombay and in this connection copies of a letter dated the 18th February 1947 and its enclosure received from^the Chairman, Pers^ian Gulf Lighting Service Committee are attached for information. It will be observed from these papers that the Committee has suggested that the Admiralty should be requested to arrange for a survey of the shoal area with a view to determine whether it can be lighted as suggested. It will also be observed that the Committee has further suggested that the Admiralty should be requested at the same time to arrange for a check survey of the Bu Athama Shoal. 5 . j am to request that the case may be represented to tie Admiralty, and that the action which it is proposed to take may be intimated as soon as possible to this Government.

Subject:- Light on Shah Allum Reference correspondence ending with your letter No.306-M-III(24)/46, dated the 7th January 1947 on the above subject. Since the establishment of a light floac. on Cable Banu, the United States Maritime Commission through their Regional Director at Bombay have approached this office with a request to install a light on Shah Allum also, vide copy of their letter dated the 9th December 46 enclosed. The proposal contained therein has been ocamined and placed before the Advisory Committee at a meeting held on the 5th instant. The followi g resol tion was passed by the Com ittee:- n The Committee recommends that a Survey of the ohah A^lum Shoal area be made in the first instance with a view to determine whether i*b can be lighted as suggested by the U.S. Maritijte Commission, as surveys in the Persian Gulf are not the responsibility of the PGLS the Admiralty be approached for necessary action. At the same time the Admiraly should be asked to check the present condition of the Bu Athama Shoal which is fifteen miles due north of the Bahrein Lightvessel. The Chairman should send an interim reply to the U.S.Caritime Com ission to this efiect'*. It is therefore suggested that the Admiralty # be approached by you to undertake the necessary survey/ of the area as recommended by the advisory Committee. This office may kindly be informed of the action taken by you.J / Co y of letter dated the 29th December 46 from the Regional Director, U.S. Maritime Com iission, Bo mbay to the Chairman PGLS Adv.

We would like 41so to confirm the writer’s conversation with you on December 7, in which the matter was discussed further. In view of your assurance that the Persian Gulf Lighting Service would be prepared to install a Light on Shah Allum Shoal provided it was recommended by the P.C.L.S. Advisory Com ittee, may we request that the matter be placed on the Agenda for discussion at the next meeting of the Advisory Committee, which we understand wil be in mid-January/. We are informing the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Arabian American Oil Co. of this request, as their representatives are expected to be present at the meeting. As we stated in our letter of December 3, the U.S. Maritie Commission has a large number of vessels entering the Persian Gulf, of which the majority proceed to Bahrein, and since there have already teen groundings on Shah Allum Shaols, we are most desirous of having a light established there as an aid to Navigation. Your assistance in presenting this matoer to the Advisory Committee with your favourable recommendation would be much appreciated. ”Mehta' 14/-COPY. ^ ^ ^ UU '^ ^b, A j&amp;A■ rfl Military Branch I, g.h°nei. ^ ik ^ U~i Admiralty, '/HI: 9000 7^3 n S. .V.l.

G-overnment of India To INDEXED V \\' ^ % Zenodotia, London. Subject:- Reserve Funds of the Persian G-ulf Lighting Service. Reference your Express letter No.Ext.8259/46, dated 27th December 1946. A copy of a letter received from the Chairman, Persian Gulf Lightir^ Service Advisory Committee, No.l-PG(4)/47, dated 31st January 1947, forwarding details of the present position of the various Reserve Funds of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, is attached. 2. It is presumed that the representations from the Shipping Company alluded to in your letter do not refer to the accumulations in the Depreciation and Additions and Replacements Reserve Funds which, under the Rules of the Fund are maintained for the specific purpose of financing the cost of replacement of existing assets. Having regard to the fact that the Service maintains 3 lightships, 10 lighthouses and a large number of buoys and beacons, and also taking into account the present abnormal price levels, the Government of India do not consider that the available reserves in these Funds are excessive. 3. The Surplus Reserve Fund, as its name implies, was made up of accumulations of surplus revenue in the pre-war years and the Fund was intended to provide for any depreciation of securities held by the Fund, for capital cost of new fixed assets and for any unforeseen contingencies arising from the obsolescence of existing assets due to new improvements or other causes. The question whether this Fund should or should not be allowed to accumulate was considered exhaustivelyg) @ exhaustively in 1938 in consultation with the ^hviao|ry^ ^ \ \ I A ' ' Goiimittee in Bombay* At that time the amount available in the Fund stood at Es*7,64,786, which was roughly equal to the normal expenditure of the Persian G-ulf Lighting S e rvice ^ or ^ wo yes- rs * It was decided that this would be an adequate reserve against possible reduction in revenue owing to transfer of some of the lights to the Iranian Government and other contingencies, and that as the financial position of the service was strong it was not necessary to allow the Fund to grow further• There have been no additions to the Fund since then, except the interest earned by its investments, and actually the service has been working at a loss during recent years. 4. As the Secretary of State may be aware, Government of India have at present under consideration certain plans prepared by the Director, Basra Port, and the Engineer-in-Chief,Lighthouse Department, for the improvement and modernisation of aids to navigation in the Persian Gulf. The proposals made in those Plans include establishment of up to date and improved lights, both attended and unattended., and oi a chain oi radio-beacons and buoys for the assistance of shipping visiting the Gulf, the making of certain necessary replacements which could not be effected during the war and purchase of a light tender. Further consideration of the proposals is pending decision of the Persian Government regarding arrangements f or the maintenance of the lights in their territorial waters. It is not unlikely that the purchase of a light tender, which has already been taken up by the N.H.Q. with the Admiralty, will alone consume most of the available resources of the Surplus Reserve Fund. 5. The Government of India trust that it will be agreed that, in view of the position stated in the preceding paragraphs, there has•• 3 \ ^ — there has been no excessive or unjustified accumulation oj. reserves by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service to the detriment of the facilities provided by the Se rv ice.

( eolots Confirming ,T. Clancy*s telephone conversation with you on January 15, there are riven below details concern- inp the need for marking Shah i.llum Shoal, a hazard to navigation in the Persian Uulf. This shoal is shown on British Admiralty chart no, 2830 as an unmarked two-fathom spot in Lat. 26 ° 26* N and Long. 52° 31* 3 near the southern approaches to Bahrein Island, directly in the path of ships passing between Kais and Bahrein Light Vessels. During the past two years considerable correspondence has been exchanged between the various local authorities concerned and it is believed that the need for placing a marker of some kind on this shoal is firmly established. However, it is not clear who should be asked to perform the work or what clearance may be necessary. The American Consul at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in a despatch dated August 24, 1946 reported on the need for marking the shoal and added that perhaps the British Government, through the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, might take steps to eliminate this navigational menace. In a letter from the United States Navy Department to the Department, dated October 31, 1946, it was stated • that, 'This matter was discussed by the U.S. Naval Attach^, Cairo, with the local British Naval Authorities and a request was made by them to the Basra Harbor Trust to mark the shoal suitably. It is understood that the Jarbor Trust has indicated that the shoal will be marked if the Iranian Government makes the request.' Mr. Andr6 F.

'■ty. /V|^ KkLsM-) u-k^ &lt;?. a. % V Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the proposed transfer to H.M.G. of direct administrative control and consequent expenditure in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf and in Muscat and to state that H.M.G. would at the sane time wish to take up with tne Government of India the ques tion of the future of the Persian Gulf Lightijqg Service. 2. The lersian Gulf buoys and lights were originally established by British efforts and were maintained by the British—India Steam Navigation Compary at their own expense, -he Secretary of State understands that in about 1911 the existing buoys and lights were, at the su^^restion of H.M.G., talcen over by Government at a valuation estimated in advance as £1,000, to be divisible equally between - ~Kju British and Indian revenues«(j3f auich howevei? only £855 was paid, the remainder being deducted on account of buoys found to be missing on their being taken over from the B.I.S.N. Company^ It was at the sane time arranged that the cost of future administra tion, which was to be performed by the Royal Indian Marine, should also be equally divisiiit between British and Indian revenues. In 1925 a further change in administration was (10337) Wt. 14054/^.104 10,000 5/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

In connection with the proposal that they should now assume direct administrative control in uhe Persian G-ulf, K.M.G-. n^aw wis.i to propose that they should themselves tau:e over from the Government of India responsibility for the control and administration of the Persian G-ulf Lighting Service. H.M.G. would propose that the Service should be placed under the supervision of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and that the Advisory Committee should in future sit at Bahrein. Provision would be made for the representation on that Committee of any Indian shioping interests and, if desirable, other comnercial interests that may be concerned. Bahrein would appear* in present conditions the most suitable place for the location of the Advisory Committee in view of its central situation in the Persian Gulf, the facility of its communications^ and the comparative ease of arranging for the representation there of Oil Companies operating in the Persian Gulf area. 6. If the Government of India agree in principle with this proposal^H.M.G. would be glad if they could be furnished with a detailed statement of the present assets of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service botn in respect of trie equipment and the cash balances which^ it is assumed, would pass with the transference of control. 7.

I* S.N.Company all costs, including that of the actual purchase of the buoys, have been divided equally between British and Indian revenues and when in 1925 the fund became self-supporting, H.14G. gave a grant of £5,000 a year for 5 years to cover any deficit that might arise while the Government of India refused to contribute unless the deficit should exceed £5&gt;000» Since 1929 the fund has supported itself entirely from the port dues collected at Basra and Abadan and therefore the Government of India can hardly claim to have spent anything on the service within the last 20 years„ I have accordingly assumed in the draft letter that the Governrrent of India will not expect any compensation on the transfer of the service* I submit a draft letter to the Government of India and an Express Letter asking for preliminary information as to the state of the finances of the service*4 /; ©OXV Our Reference:- 5. &amp; 0.

Charts :— (1.) “ Chart to accompany the Report of a Committee on Lighthouses for the Persian Gulf, dated, 29th April 1909.” (Pol. 3620/1909; copy sent to Foreign Office and Admiralty 1st September 1909.) (2.) “ Persian Gulf—Mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab River” the tracing that accompanied the letter of the Director of the Royal Indian Marine to the Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, No. 3270, dated the loth May 1911. (Pol. 4013/1911 ; copy sent, to Foreign Office and Admiralty, 10th August 1911.) J \ Scope of the Memorandum. 1. The question of the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf is part of the larger question ^ of British policy in the Gulf and neighbourhood, ' which is outside the scope of the present Memo randum. It is enough to remark that the advance of the Bagdad Railway and the activity of Turkey in the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab have recently brought the lighting and buoyage question into greater prominence. For some years the buoyage of the Gulf has been maintained by British enterprise, namely that of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and now that it seems likely that railway communication will be opened with the Persian Gulf via Asia Minor, it is urged with some force that Great Britain, the predominant maritime Power, should in the interests of British and Indian trade endeavour to improve communication with the head of the Gulf by sea. There are many C references in our papers to the difficulties of navi gation in the Gulf, especially by night, owing to incomplete surveys and defective lighting and buoyage. 2. The question of lighting and buoyage first came up in a practical form when a proposal was made by the Hamburg-American Company, in the early part of 1907, that they should contribute to the upkeep of the navigation buoys maintained in the Gulf by the British India Steam Navigation Company. It was believed that a political motive lay behind the proposal, and the suggestion was therefore made that the British Government should itself take over the buoys from the British India Company. An Inter-Departmental Conference - '' held at the Admiralty on the 17th July 1908, recommended in their Report, dated the 19th September 1908, that this action should be taken, and, further, that lights and buoys should be provided on an extended scale at Muscat and S. 126. a Inter-Departmental Conference of 17th July 1908, and Report of Sub- Committee of Committee of Imperial Defence.

Meanwhile, the Government of India had independently re commended the holding of a local enquiry with the same object, and their proposal received the approval of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, from whose Report, dated the 26th January 1909, the following is an extract:— Letter of Government F . 0reigI l department (Secret), No. 156,13th August Pol. 1646/08. “ 4. Lighthouses and Buoyage. “ While it is desirable that, if the British “ shipowning Companies press for additional “ navigational lights in the Gulf, all reasonable “ steps should be taken to meet their wishes, yet, in “ view of the limited volume of the trade at present, “ the Committee do not recommend that any “ considerable expenditure that could not be “ recouped by light dues should be incurred under “ this head. But they are of opinion that it would “ be worth while to incur the expenditure involved “ in the proposal now under consideration, to send “ a Commission to collect information, consisting “ of the Senior Naval Officer, the officer in charge “ of the Indian Marine Survey, and an expert to be “ obtained through the Trinity House. This “ Commission would also deal with the question of “ buoyage. This proposal has the support of the “ Inter-Departmental Committee (Foreign Office, “ India Office, and Admiralty). The cost will be “ that of the expert and incidental expenses; “ the other two officers receiving no extra pay.” The Treasury afterwards agreed to accept as a charge against British revenues a moiety of the cost of the enquiry.

The Committee''' presented their Report on the 29th April 1909, and a summary of the lights and buoys proposed by them is printed as Appendix I. Briefly, they recommended (para graph 7 of Report) the establishment in the Gulf of 13 lights| in all (in addition to buoys), and of these seven were named as those most urgently required, viz., in order of importance,— (1.) Shatt-al-Arab Bar, light vessel and four buoys. (2.) Musandam (Little Quoin). (3.) Muscat. (4.) Bushire. (5.) Shaikh Shuaib. (6.) Ras-al-Mutaf. (7.) Tanb. (8.) Kubbar Island (Koweit). (9.) Ras-al-Arz (Koweit). (10.) Bahrein. (ll.) Lingah. (12.) Debai. (13.) Bunder Abbas. The Committee further recommended (para graph 12) the provision of a lighthouse tender, and (paragraph 15) of a depot at Koweit.

Hood, the expert in lighthouse construction, whose services on the Committee had been obtained from the Trinity House. The Summary with which his Report concluded is printed as Appendix IT, and, in view of subsequent correspondence, it is useful to note the cost of two items in particular, viz., 30,000Z. initial, and 5,000Z. annual recurring, for a new lighthouse tender, and 22,000Z. initial, for a depot at Koweit. The general financial effect of his estimates is apparent in the following extract from a letter addressed by the India Ofhce to the Admiralty on the 1st September in reply to one of the 7th August in which the Admiralty had commented on the Committee’s own Report: — “ It will be seen that, apart from any expendi- “ ture on the purchase of land for lighthouses or “ for other works, the cost of the entire scheme “ proposed by the Committee, including the pro- “ vision of a lighthouse tender, is estimated by “ Mr. Hood at 158,150Z. initial, and 10,745L annual “ recurring expenditure ; or, if certain savings are “ effected by the conversion of a Royal Indian “ Marine vessel into a lighthouse tender and by “ modifications in the system of lighting, at “ 107,500/. initial, and 0,280/. annual recurring “ expenditure. The cost of an alternative scheme “ on a smaller scale, to include provision of the “ lights recommended in paragraph 7 of the Com- mittee’s Report as those most urgently required, “ is estimated at 120,550/. initial, and 8,720/. annual “ recurring expenditure—or, if savings of the kind “ mentioned above are effected, at 92,300/. initial “ and 8,515/. annual recurring expenditure. “ The expenditure involved in the Committee’s “ recommendations, even when limited to the “ smaller scheme, is very considerable. It was “ clearly laid down by Lord Morley, in the letter to “ the Foreign Office of the 22nd December 1908, “ proposing the appointment of the Committee, that “ the question of giving effect to its recommenda- “ tions must be governed by financial considera- “ tions, and the Lords Commissioners of the “ Treasury, in their letter to the Foreign Office of “ the 27th January 1909, were unable to hold out “ any prospect of a contribution from the British “ Exchequer towards the cost of any lights. In “ these circumstances, and in view of the necessity “ for rigid economy in Indian finance, Lord Morley “ is not prepared to consider at present the question “ of giving effect to the Committee’s recommenda- “ tions. He proposes, subject to any observations “ the Lords Commissioners may have to offer, to “ inform the Government of India accordingly.” A copy of the letter addressed to the Admiralty was forwarded to the Foreign Office with a request for their observations.4 5. In reply, the Foreign Office concurred in the view that it was impossible at the moment to carry into effect the full scheme recommended by the Committee, but they urged as ah rat step the taking over of the buoys of the British India ( ompany. The Admiralty also agreed, and, after some further correspondence, the assent of the Treasury was obtained to the equal division between British anti Indian revenues of the estimated expendituie involved in this proposal, viz., 1 ,OOOZ. initial as payment to the Company, and 135Z. 6s. bd. annual recurring, m respect of future maintenance. ie deed of assignment that was_ ultimately executed on the 9th February 1911 provided for the transfer to Government of 'the full number of 15 buoys and one beacon (at Bahrein) that had belonged to the Company, on the understanding that a portion ot the sum*of 1,00()Z. should be refunded later, m view of the fact that certain buoys had been reported as missing at the time when the deed was executed It was arranged that for the future the buoys should be maintained by the Royal Indian Marine, who were also to be responsible for replacing the missing buoys except one—the “ Lawrence ” buoy—that was no longer required owing to the shitting ot the Shatt-al-Arab channel.

During the time when the transfer of these buoys to Government was being arranged, reports were furnished bv His Majesty’s Consul of meetings held at Basrah on the 21st and 28th June 1910, at which the local German community had supported projects lor the lighting and buoyage of the Shatt-al-Arab by Turkish agency. Further, the lurkish Com modore stated that he would ask his Government to undertake the lighting of Fao and the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab without any charge on shipping. At the instance of Colonel Cox, it was decidec as a counter-measure to place an acetylene gas buoy on the outer bar, at a cost estimated not to exceed 6001. initial, plus 40Z. annual re curring, in respect of maintenance. Ot this expenditure the Treasury agreed to defray a moiety as before, the political aspect ot the matter beino’ strongly urged on them by the Secretai y ot State 5 for Foreign Affairs. 0 The placing of the buoy was expedited on news being received from Con stantinople that a scheme for buoying and lighting the Shatt-al-Arab had been submitted to the lurkish Minister of Marine.

A further development took place a little later when the Commander of the lurkish guard- ship in the Shatt-al-Arab declared that he had categorical instructions to lay down buoys and that the 'matter had been rendered urgent by the constant complaints of German vessels. Instruc tions were thereupon issued by the Government of India to the Naval Commander-in-Chief that the British buoys should be laid down without regard Continuance of Turkish activity.

The activity of the Turkish authorities still continued. Reports were received of their plans lor supplying pilots at the mouth of the bhatt-aT Arab, for a lighthouse at Fao, a light-vessel near the outer bar. and the laying of further buoys. The chart, referred to at the head of this memo randum, which accompanied, a letter of the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, dated the 15th May last, shows the situation at last arrived at. According to this information there are now in the Shatt-al-Arab live Turkish buoys and one Turkish light vessel, while the British buoys are seven in number, of which one is the lighted gas buoy referred to in paragraph 6. According to a telegram from the Naval Com mander-in-Chief, dated the 22nd April last, the position of these lights and buoys is as follows :— — Turkish. British Buoys. Buoys. Light Vessel. High seas 5 2 1 Turkish waters 1 | 3 — Persian waters 1 — The Turks, it may be added, have issued formal notices to Mariners regarding their lights and buoys, and have even been reported from time to time to be intending to tamper with the British buoys. Quite recently we have heard also of Turkish proposals for the dredging of the Shatt-al- Arab bar. The Conservancy of the Shatt-al- Arab. Memorandum to Turkish Government, 29th July 1911.

The whole question of the conservancy of the Shatt-al-Arab was thus forced to the front, and in a letter to the Government of India, dated the 24th March last, the Naval Commander-in-Chief reported that the situation was becoming an impossible one : — “ The only solution,” he continued, “ would “ appear to be the formation of an international “ commission on which Turkey, Persia and Great “ Britain would be represented .... It may “ prove necessary to admit German and Russian “ representatives on the conservancy, but I am “ strongly of opinion that this would be a lesser “ evil than to allow the Turks to have the uncon- “ trolled management of the waterway.” It is unnecessary here to follow the course of the corre- spondencef that ensued upon the Admiral’s sug-gestion. The decision ultimately arrived at by His Majesty’s Government is defined in the following extract from a memorandum communicated to the Turkish Ambassador on the 29th July last* : — “ Certain difficulties have recently arisen in “ regard to the buoyage of the Shatt-al-Arab. For “ a great number of years British shipping has, “ owing to its volume, been predominantly, and “ until recently almost exclusively, interested in “ these aids to navigation. For over fifty years the “ work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the “ river has been carried out by British agency to “ the general satisfaction of all conct rned. “ In these circumstances, His Majesty's Govern- “ ment have some difficulty in appreciating why the “ Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements ; but, “ being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a “ spirit of conciliation, they would propose to the “ Ottoman Government the appointment of a small “ riverain commission, comprised of a British and a “ Turkish representative, with an engineer to be “ mutually agreed upon. This commission would superintend all matters .pertaining to improvement ,c of navigation, and it would likewise superintend “ the requisite periodical surveys. “ As regards the jest of the Persian Gulf, on the “ other hand, the Turkish Government, so far as “ they are concerned, would recognise the right of “ Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, “ buoying, and pilotage ; (6) to police its waters ; “ and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements.” Pol. 3912/11. * This was in accordance with the recommendation of a Repo it b\ tie Sub-Committee of Imperial Defence, dated the 14th July 1911. 10. It is proposed now to describe in greater detail the projects at present before His Majesty’s Government for the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf. In a letter to the Government of India, dated the 25th February 1911,*' it was strongly urged by the Naval Commander-in-Chief that certain of the lights and buoys that had been recommended by the Committee of enquiry should be provided with out delay. Correspondence ensued between the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the India Office, with the result that on the 15th September last a letter was addressed to the Foreign Office requesting that the Treasury might be moved to accept as a charge against British revenues a moiety of expen diture, estimated according the most accurate data obtainable at— £ Initial - - - 47,600 Annual recurring - - 2,490 for the provision of— (1) An acetylene gas buoy and one light-vessel in the Shatt-al-Arab ; (2) Lighthouses at Musaudam (Little Quoin), Tanb Island, and Shaikh Shuaib Island ; and (3) A light vessel for Bushire.

It was further explained that a lighthouse tender, an essential part of the scheme, might have to be provided at an estimated cost of c'0,000L initial, and 5,COOL annual recurring.

In a letter dated the 28th October 1911, the Treasury drew attention to certain points in con nection with the • scheme, but expressed their readiness to bear a moiety of the charges connected with the provision of the acetylene gas buoy in the Shatt-al-Arab, and of the lighthouses at Musandam, Tanb Island, and Sheikh Shuaib Island. They questioned, on the other hand, the necessity of the light-vessel 0 proposed for the Shatt-al-Arab, and urged the substitution of a light-buoy| for a light- vessel 0 at Bushire, in view of certain observations made in Admiral Slade’s letters to the Admiralty and the Government of India, dated the 11th May and 6th August respectively, which seemed to indicate that less expensive proposals might suffice. Correspondence is still proceeding with the Government of India as regards the suggestions made by the Treasury, also as to the provision and cost of the lighthouse tender. Another item of expenditure that must apparently also be provided for is that of the depot which the Committee recommended should be located at Koweit for gas-works, the storage of buoys, &amp;c. In Mr. Hood’s estimates a capital sum of 22,000L was entered on this account, but presumably the expenditure will be considerably less in view of the more restricted character of the lighting and buoyage proposals now under consideration. In any case no allowance need be made in respect of the maintenance of the depot, since charges on this account are included in the estimates given in Mr. Hood’s Report of the cost of the several lights. Summary of maximum possible expenditure. 12. Assuming, for the sake of completeness, that the lights and buoys recommended in the letters of the India Office of the 15th September and 18th November 1911 (see paragraph 10 above) were all provided (without the adoption of the Treasury suggestions), that a lighthouse tender were procured at a cost of 30,000L initial, and 5,000h annual re curring, and that a depot were equipped at the fullcapital cost of 22,000?., the resulting expenditure would amount to— £ Initial - - - 102,400 Annual recurring - - 7,700 It will be noted that a large proportion of this expenditure, both initial and annual, is represented by the cost of the lighthouse tender. 13. At this point mention may be made of two projects which though not directly connected with the subject of this Memorandum may yet entail considerable expenditure of a somewhat similar kind. In the first place, it is proposed to carry out certain surveys in the Persian Gulf that may entail the employment of a Royal Indian Marine vessel for several years. The Government of India have been asked for information as to the cost and duration of the operations, in order that the Treasury may be approached as to bearing a moiety of the charge. Secondly, the provision of wireless telegraph stations in the Persian Gulf has recently been considered, and, subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office, the Secretary of State in Council has approved a scheme estimated to cost approximately 19,087?. initial, and 4,647?. annual recurring. This expenditure also would be equally divisible between British and Indian Revenues. 14. The question whether any part of the expenditure to be incurred in the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf could be recouped by means of the levy of light dues has frequently been raised in our correspondence, but the matter presents great difficulties, and it has been strongly urged that the inception of the lighting and buoy age scheme should not be delayed pending a satisfactory solution.* In a lettert dated the 29th March last, the Foreign Office wrote as follows on this subjectThe suggested levy could not be “ carried out without the consent of the Powers “ whose flags are flown by the vessels navigating “ the Gulf, and such consent would not be forth- “ coming except on conditions implying that very “ international control which it is the aim of His “ Majesty’s Government to exclude.” The point has again been touched upon in the correspondence between the treasury and the Foreign Office, and the position will become clearer if ever negotiations on the basis of the British Memorandum to Turkey of the 29th July last (paragraph 9 above) are successfully concluded.

It may be useful to explain, in continuation of the printed departmental Memorandum of the 28th December 1911, the present position of the scheme for the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf, adopted as the result of the local enquiry held in 1909. A convenient starting point is the “ summary of maximum possible expenditure,” described in paragraph 12 of that Memorandum in the following words : “ Assuming, for the sake of “ completeness, that the lights and buoys recom- “ mended in the letters of the India Office of the “ LHh September and 18th November 1911 (see “ paragraph 10 above) were all provided (without “ the adoption of the Treasury suggestions), that a “ lighthouse tender were procured at a cost of “ 30,000L initial, and 5,000L annual recurring, “ and that a depot were equipped at the full “ capital cost of 22,0001., the resulting expenditure “ would amount to :—initial 102,400L, annual “ recurring 7,700L” 2. The “ Treasury suggestions ” above referred to were that a light vessel proposed for the Shatt- el-Arab should be dispensed with, and that a lighted buoy should be substituted at Bushire for a light- vessel. After some correspondence the Treasury withdrew their objection to the Shatt-al-Arab light- vessel, but, as regards Bushire, it was decided that a lighted buoy (at the outer anchorage in addition to that for the inner anchorage) would be sufficient. In another important respect the scheme described in paragraph 1 was modified, viz., in the elimination of the spare light-vessel (cost 9,500L) that had been included as part of the equipment of the depot (cost 22,000F) Modifications in India Office scheme.

Government once more with a view to the grant of a concession—say, a lease for 99 years—which would allow a lighthouse to be built and worked by His Majesty’s Government. If it were not for the expense, a good way out of the difficulty would be the substitution of a light-vessel for the proposed lighthouse. The cost of the lighthouse, as stated above, is 8,000L initial, and 400L annual recurring. The corresponding figures for the cost of a light-vessel, according to Trinity House estimates, are 9,500L initial, and 650Z. annual recurring. (The Indian authorities have, however, stated that they could themselves build a light-vessel for 1,0801. less, i.e., 8,420k, see paragraph 5 below.) 5. On the recommendation of the Government of India the light-vessel for the Shatt-al-Arab is being constructed in Bombay Dockyard, where light-vessels have been built for the Bay of Bengal. According to latest information, it is anticipated that a saving of 1,080L may be effected on the sanctioned estimate (9,500k) Idle iron mast, lantern, &amp;c. are to be sent out from home.

Five lighted buoys have been sent out (in addition to the lighted buoy provided for the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab in 1911). The sixth, intended for the inner bar of the Shatt-al-Arab, is not for the present being supplied, in view of the negotiations opened with the Turkish Government for the establishment of a Shatt-al-Arab Navigation Commission.* 7. The unlit buoys are, like the light-vessel, being constructed in Bombay Dockyard on the recommendation of the Government of India. 8. A matter in which no progress has yet been made is that of the lighthouse tender. The Committee that reported after local inquiry in 1909 on the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf regarded it as imperative that a specially constructed steamer should be provided to act as a lighthouse tender, and Mr. 1). W. Hood, the expert member of the Committee, wrote in his Supplementary Report :—“ I estimate her cost, “ delivered in the Persian Gulf, after construction “ in England, at 30,000k The Indian Government “ from their own experience will be able to estimate “ what her annual maintenance would be in the “ East, but it would probably amount to about “ 5,000k per annum, inclusive of wages, repairs, “ coal, stores, and all charges.” 'These figures—initial expenditure 30,000k, and annual recurring 5,000k—represent the maximum estimate sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council and the Treasury, but the plans received from India are for a larger vessel than that contem plated, and one that would cost very much more to maintain. The matter is still under consideration.9. It was first proposed to locate the lighthouse depot at Koweit, but this plan was abandoned in favour of a site on the land leased by the Ang o Persian Oil Company on the island of Abadan, near Mohammerah. Details are about to be investigated locally, but the conditions contemplated are, briefly, that land* up to a total of two acres should be rented at U. an acre for 49 years from the '29th May 1912, the period of the Company’s own lease, and that the Company should carry out certain works recommended by the L unity House, supply oil (if in accordance with specification), and erect the necessary oil tanks. It is hoped that the result of the local investi gation will enable work at the depot to proceed without delay. An appreciable saving should apparently be effected on the cost of the depot, as originally estimated, through the employment of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s agency. 10. In accordance with the recommendation of Trinity House, certain stores for the depot aie being sent out from England, viz :— 2 spare lighted buoys. 2 spare lanterns. 3 sets of spare buoy moorings. It is also in contemplation to send out a crane. 11. Mention may here be made of the supply of two dioptric lanterns for the Residency at Hush ire at an estimated cost of approximately 124k initial expenditure, plus 21 per cent, for Trinity House charges, and 24L annual recurring. The Treasury took exception to the supply of these lanterns outside the sanctioned programme, and explanations were furnished by this Office. The Lighthouse Depot.

Lawrence should be gazetted “ Assistant Inspector of Lights. He has also suggested a scale of allowances for officers and men of the “Lawrence” employed in lighting and buoyage work. The views of the Government of India on these proposals have not yet been received. Any extia expenditure on this head may perhaps be met out of savings effected on other parts of the scheme. J. E.

GAM.4h Lighting'gHg Bu|| t«g.-t&amp; the lersian A meeting was held at the Foreign Office on the 29th October to discuss future arrangenents for the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf, following were present: /'] r* Garran (Foreign Office) in the Chair. Colonel Hay (Political Resident* lersian Gulf) Mr* Harrison (India Office) Mr. R.C. Mitchell (Ml istry of Fuel and T ower) ^Mr* Meyer (Admiralty) ( /iliaa Churohard (Kinietry of Transport) /fir. Olenister (Ministry of Transport) Conwander Henderson (Ministry of Transport) Mr^ Bopenian' (Treasury) -fa*. Wilson (Treasury) - /J IT /6isa Waterloo (Foreign Office), !r. Garran explained that t e meeting had been called as a result of a letter which the Ministry of Transport had received from the British Tanker Company, suggesting that the administration of the Persian Gulf _ Lighting Service should be reviewed, in the light of the constitutional changes which were taking place m India and cormplaining about the way in which the funds of the l Lighting Service were being administered in Bombay ana finally urging that more comprehensive arrangements should be made for the collection of dues at * ;or ^? 4 in the Persian Gulf beside Basra and Abadan. The question of the lighting of the Persian Gulf would have had to come up for consideration in the fairly near future in any case, and there was advantage in having some discussion of the position while Colonel Hay, the Political Resident, was still in London. j£&gt; •»“ I'RESSITT POSITION The meeting briefly reviewed the present position, which may be summarised as follows: The lights in the Persian Gulf, which consist -4$ of three lightships, five lighthouses and a large number of smaller lights, buoys and beacons were originally established by British efforts and were maintained by the B.I.S.K. Company at their own expense. About 1911 His Majesty’s Government suggested that these lights and buoys should be taken over at a valuation by the Government of India and that the latter should arrange for the maintenance of the service, the cost being shared /equally■ I agunliy between Brltlsh ^d InA lan revetiuea. This wag agi-eed to f service cane under the control of the Government of India. In 1925 it was decided to run the service on a self-supporting hasiSf and arrangements were made to levy light dues on all shipping entering and leaving the ports of Basra and Abadan, except vessels exem ted from the payment of the dues. it is not clear whether any law was actually passed by the Iran Government authorising the Fort Director, Basra to collect the light dues on behalf of H.M.G. and the Government of India but the dues have been satisfactorily collected. H. .G. also agreed to pay a contribution in respect of Admiralty tankers visiting the Gulf. A fund known as the 'Persian Gulf Lighting Service Fund' was created, to which all light dues collected were credited and expenditure on the maintenance and development of the service was debited. The actual administration of the service was carried out by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, (now F.O.C., .1. .) until July, 1942, with the assistance of a non-official Advisory Committee of Shipping at Bombay; and from that date the Kautical Adviser to the Government of India was entrusted with the above duties and also appointed as Chairman of the Advisory Committee. The Government of India is thus responsible for the operations of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service with the Advisory Committee assisting in an advisory capacity, while the Port Director, Basra carries out, on behalf of the Service, the servicing and upkeep of the lights and buoys, as well as the collection of dues at Abadan and Basra. Dues have only been levied on ships calling at Abadan and Basra, though arrangements have recently been made with the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the Arabian-American Oil Company for each company to make a total annual payment of £1,000 partly for the upkeep of certain lights of their own and partly as a contribution towards the general expenses of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. There was general agreement that it was * unsatisfactory that dues were only levied at Abadan and Basra, especially since the great increases in tanker traffic to Bahrein Koweit and Has Tanura. It was ag reed that the maintenance work was being satisfactorily carried out by the Basra Port Directorate and that in consequence the Lighting Service was functioning satisfactorily, though it would be necessary in the near future to replace the repairship Rearcus. The meeting had no knowledge of the present state of the balances in the hands of the Lighting Service (apart from the complaint now received from the British Tanker Con^pany and it was ‘ that the India Office should ask the Government of India for information regarding the present administrative t arrangements and the present financial position. It was also agreed that the Foreign Office should ask His Majesty*3 Bmbassy, Bagdad, to obtain from /ther 6 \ 4 n j the Basra Port Directoral^ a ^otnp^rTe list of all lighting and seamarks at present maintained hy the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. FUTURE ARRAl'IG^.IEITTS As regards future arrangements for the administration of the Lighting Services # there appeared to be three possible alternatives* (a) To carry on as at present leaving administration in the control of the Government of India. (b) That His Majesty’s Government should take over administration of the service from the Government of India. (c) That the Administration of the Service should be transferred to an international body on which the riparian states and other Interested Governments would be represented. The meeting agreed that course (a) was undesirable* The present arrangements were unsatisfactory in any case # in view of the remoteness of Bombay from the Persian Gulf and the absence of any effective control over the administration f the service. The changes that were taking ■’■’lace in India made some change in the administration all the more necessary* Course (c) however, was impracticable, on account of the backwardness of the riparian states, and in particular in view of the difficulty of arranging any satisfactory co-operation with the lersian Government. Course (b) appeared to be the only practicable alternative and it was agreed, after discussion, that the most satisfactory arrangement would be on the following lines: (i) The Lighting Service to be taken over by His Majesty’a Government who should entrust the Political Pvesident in the Persian Gulf with the responsibility for its operation. (ii) The headquarters of the Lighting Service to be established at Bahrein. (iii) The Advisory Committee at present established at Bombay, to be transferred to Bahrein and that henceforth it should include representatives of the oil companies as well as of the shipping companies (there should in fact be no great difficulty about this as most of the principal companies operating in the Persian Gulf have representatives at Bahrein)• Colonel Hay was satisfied that he could make satisfactory arrangements for the operation and administration of the Lighting Service from Bahrein. Mr. Garran said that it would be necessary for the Foreign Office to consider further whether an /arrangementV y ; w &gt; f ' V , arrangement on these lines would involve any political . oonrolicati ms, and in particular whether the estaolishment of 'the headquarters of the Service at Bahrein might involve political difficulties with the Persian It was agreed that arrangements could easily he made for the collection of lighting d’«s at Kerfeit, and Bahrein. On the other hand it would not he practicable to arrange for levying of dues at the Saadi Arabian port of Has Tanura, but it was understood that the Arabian American Oil Company* the principal users of this port, would he prepared to make an annual payment towards the maintenance of the service. It was further agreed that no change ''as called for in the present arrangements whereby the Basra Port Directorate carried out the maintenance or th Lighting Services Machinery and Equipment and the collection of dues at Basra and Abadan. It was agreed that the Foreign Office and the India Office shoula consult together regarding the timing and method of the approach to the Government of India regarding the transfer of the administration, question was clearly bound up with the ^ider question of the transfer of the Persian Gulf residency to the direct control of Hts Majesty 1 s Government. it was to be hoped that the Government of India would not raise any claim to compensation in respect of the capital value of the machinery and equipment of the Lighting Service or make any difficulty about handing over any balance of funds wnich might be in their possession. There did not indeed appear to be any good justification for the Government of India to adopt such an attitude. T.TfvHTT'NG AM) BUOYING IF I^HSIA I ZmMi. Ifae meeting briefly considered the situation regarding lighting and buoying in Persian territorial waters. In 1957, the Persian Government had notified His Majesty’s Government that it would take over responsibility for the administration of lighting in Persian territorial waters. Just what lights had been taken over was not known to the meeting but Colonel Hay said that the Persian Government had allowed the two lighthouses on the Persian shore to go out, and the only lights now showing on the Persian coast were a few buoys maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. Nevertheless, the Persian Government continued to levy lighting dues on vessels calling at Persian ports, on the basis of a law passed in 1940*WHIT KHALI* 9000 Kxt. 305 M.02704/46 Dear Os alt, MILITARY I, Ac^ni rel t y, S« W. 1» ^November, 1946.

The following were present: It. Oarran (Foreign Office) in the Chair, Colonel Hay (Political HeeidentF iersian Oulf) Jr# Harrison (India Office) Mr. F.C. Mitchell (Ministry of Fuel and Power) Mr. Meyer (Admiralty) Miss Churchard (Ministry of Transport; Mr.Olenister (Ministry of Transport) Coriander Henderson (Ministry of Transport) Mr. Copeman (Treasury) Mr. Wilson (Treasury) Miss Waterlow (Foreign Office). Mr.Oarran explained that the meeting had been called as e result of a letter which the Ministry of Transport had received from the British Tanker Company, suggesting that the administration of the Persian Oulf ighting Service be reviewed, in the light of the constitutional changes which were taking place in India and complaining about the ^oy in which the funds of the Lighting Service were being administered in Bombay and finally urging that more comprehensive arrangements should be made for the collection of dues ^ an# other ports in the Persian Oulf besidesBasra end Abadan. The question of the lighting of the Persian Oulf would have had to cone up for consideration in the fairly near future in any case, and there was advantage in having some discussion of the position while Colonel Hay, the Poliuicol Hesident, was still in London. P^ITIQM The meeting briefly reviewed the present position, tfhieh nay be sumnf rised as follows: The present arrangements date from 1925* Prion to that date, find beginning from 1911, cost of the ns into, .once of the lighting service had been shared equally between His Majesty 1 s Govermaent and the Government of India and no lighting dues were levied. Before 1911, the lighting Services were maintained by the British India Steam NavigE tion Company. In 1925, at the pressing request of His Majesty*a Government it was agreed that dues shoulr be levied on ships using the Persian Oulf end the Government of Iraq agreed to collect such dues on behalf of His ajest^ o Government and the Government of In«ia from shj s c. la *g— at Abadan and Basra. These dues were collected by the Port Directorate at Basra* which also undertook the '7ork of maintenance of the machinery and equipment of the lighting service. No dues were levied on ships calling at other Oulf ports* (though arrangements were subsequently made with the Bahrein Petroleum Coii^an^ for the making of an annual payment partly for the upkeep of certain lights of their own and partly for the upkeep of the la-ghting service). ~Contfce&amp; : of administration was left in the hands of the Persian Gylf Lighting Service with headquarters in Bombay^ (The P.wte understood, to operate c B -an offslioot • -of ^the-Bep*&gt;rtwent ^ -or•Ge^erce or-the-Gavernmen^t^’Or^iTjd'io) # and the GovernLient of Inc 1 a agreed in 1925 to the appointment of an advisory committee of shipowners to advise the P.j.L.S. on all matters pertaining to the lighting and buoying of the Gulf. T It seemed to have been generally recognised that the machinery end equipment of the lighting service belonged to the Government of India* but it was not clear ^ to the meeting why this should be* as* since 1911 and up to 1925 the costs of the Service had been shared equally between His Majesty*s Government and the Government of India and since that date* the Service had been self- supporting. ( There was general agreement that it was unsatisfactory that dues were only levied at Abadan and Bahrein* especially since the great increases in tanker traffic to Bahrein Koweit and Has Tanura• It was agreed that tne maintonance work was being satisfactorily carried out by the Basrc Port Directorate and that inconsequence the Lighting Service was functioning satisfactorily* though it would be necessary in the near future to replace the repairshi x j Nearcfis. The meeting had no knowledge of the present state of the balances in the hands of the Lighting Service (apart from the complaint now received from the British Tanker Company) and it was agreed that the India Office should ask the Government of India for information regarding the present administrative arrangements and the present financial position. It was also agreed that the Foreign Office should ask His Majesty’s Smbassy* Bagdad* to obtain from the Basra Port Directorate a complete list of all lighting and seamarks at present maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. FUTUH&amp; As regards future arrangements for the administration of the Lighting Services* there appeared to be three possible alternntives* (a) To carry on as at present leaving administration in the control of the Government of India. (b)/(b) That His JfejMtgr** Gorernment should taj:e over administration of the service from the Government of India. (c) That the Administration of the Service should be transferred to an international body on which the riparian states and other interested Governments would be represented. The meeting agreed that course (a) was undesirable. The present arrangements were unsatisfactory in any case# in view of the remoteness of Bombay from the Persian Gulf and the absence of any effective control over the administration of the service. The changes that were taking place in India made some change in the administration all the more necessary. Course (c) however# was impracticable# on account of the backwardness of the riparian states# and in particular in view of the difficulty of arranging any satisfactory co-operation with the Persian Government. Course (b) appeared to be the only practicable alternative and it was agreed# after discussion# that the most satisfactory arrangement would be on the following linest (i) Ohe Lighting Service to be taken over by His Majesty’s Government who should entrust the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with the responsibility for its operation. (ii) The headquarters of the Lighting Service to be established at Bahrein. (iii) The Advisory Committee at present established at Bombay# to be transferred to Bahrein and that henceforth it should include representatives of the oil companies as well as of the shipping companies (there should in fact be no greet difficulty about this as most of the principal companys operating in the Persian Gulf have representatives at Bahrein). Colonel Hay was satisfied that he could make satisfactory arrangements for the operation and administration of the Lighting Service from Bahrein. Mr. Garran said that it would be necessary for the Foreign Office to consider further whether an arrangement on these lines would involve any political complications# and in particular whether the establishment of the headquarters of the Service at Bahrein might involve political difficulties with the Persian Government. It was agreed that arrangements could easily be made for the collection of lighting dues at Koweit and Bahrein. On the other hand it would not be practicable to arrange for levying of dues at the Saudi Arabian port of Has Tanura# but it was understood that the Arabian nerican OH Company# the principal users of this port# would be prepared to make an annual payment towards/S.W.l. 25th October, 1946. J) c tcv I'll' This is to confirm that a meeting will he held in Room 107 on the 2nd Floor on Tuesday, November 29th, at 3 p.m. to discuss the question of the transference of the ownership and management of the Persian Gulf lighting system when the Government of India becomes independent.

Dear Sir, CONTROL OF LIGHTS IN THE FERS1AJT GULF Having rogard to the situation in India, it seems possible that certain functions heretofore performed by the Government of India will require review and amongst them would appear to e the part played by the Indian Government in controlling the Lights in the Persian Gulf. The attention of the :iinlstry is accordingly invited to the conditions which have prevailed since November 1925- Prior to that date the British Government agreed that henceforth the Indian Government should control the Persian Gul Lights the Port Director, Basrah, being authorised to maintain machinery and equipment, and a Persian Gulf Light service was inaugurated, all personnel being subordinate to the ort Director. Cost of the service was to be met by Light Dues collected by the Port Director. The Government of India was to administer the service and manage the funds and was to be advised by a Coinaittee of Shipowners and others set up in Bombay. This organisation, which still obtains, has functioned quite satisfactorily in relation to the operational supervision and control exercised by the Basrah Port Directorate, but in the years preceding the recent war the ship owing interests represented on the Advisory Committee in Bombay (i.e. the principal payers of the dues, B.I.S.N. Company and ourselves; were by no means content with the way in v/hich ts.e lighting * /funds * itEXT 6355 funds were being administered. It was cdnsidered that cash reserves were being built up to ap_undue extent and althoug appropriate representations and recommendations were made Irom time to time by the Advisory Committee they were without effect. Although opportunity has not yet occurred to examine properly the financial effect on the Lighting Service Funds of the war years, it is believed that the reserves have been built up to yet higher levels. Whatever the merits of ttese large reserve funds if related to possible renewals and improvements to the lighting service at high post-war costs, it has been felt most unlikely, from pre-war experience, that the reserves would be used to a reasonable extent, the probability being that capital expenditure would be met as in the past, from revenue with consequent serious detriment to the level of the Light dues. In consequence of this situation consideration was being given to representationy to H.M.Government towards improvement in the administration arrangements of the P.G. Lighting service, but it is felt that the matter is brought to a head by the possibility of the imminent creation of an independent India. Upon the assumption that,irrespective of the roerits of the administration of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service by a British India Government, it might bo deemed inappropriate to extend the responsibility to an Independent Government it is the purpose of this letter to ensure that the matter is brought to the notice of your Ministry from the pointy of view of the shipowners princrcall, concerned in the payment of the Light Dues. In conclusion, reference is considered desirable to the nee;d for any new administration to institute more comprehensive arrangements for collection of the light dues than those obtaining at present, whereby only ships entering and leaving the Port of Basrah are chargeable. Frequent representation has been made by the Advisory Committee in Bombay urging for arrangements to be instituted for the collection of light dues /in uI ' ill J';*. 1 635 j in respect of the cons iderable ^ipunt o] tanker tonnage loading at Bahrein buti n»- action appoaci to have resulted which, you will appreciate, throws an undue burden upon shipping using Basrah.

(Copy to: His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain). With further reference to our conversation during my visit to Basra last week in connection with the possibility of placing some form of light on Shar Allum Shoal, the following remarks are forwarded: 2. in view of the grounding of the U.S.S.'CACAPON' on the Shar Allum Shoal which occured on the 24th April 1946, it is most strongly recommended that this real danger to navigation should receive your early consideration. 3. During our conversation you pointed out the difficulty of placing a light vessel or light float on Shar Allum Shoal due to the physical formation of the sea bed. This difficulty we both agreed could be overcome by either placing an additional light vessel or light float on cable Bank, 19 miles to the North of Shar Allum Shoal or shifting the existing light float on Stiffe Bank to Cable Bank. ihe S^iffe Bank is not a real danger to navigation as the least depth over it is 15 fathoms and the light serves only as a route light. If this float were shifted to Cable Bank it would serve equally well as a route light for ships , bound for the Northern Gulf Ports and also Bahrain, Ras Tannusa- In addition the Bahrain, Ras Tannusa shipping if using this route light on Cable Bank would pass well to the Northward and clear of the danger of the Shar Allum Shoal. 5 * , It is also suggested that Shar Allum wShoal might be marked with a light buoy* y It is estimated that approximately 60 tankers pdkceed to Bahrain and Ras Tannusa each month plus a number of general oagro vessels. 7. With this amount of traffic passing in the vicinity °£ kj*® Shoal it is felt that this real danger to navigation oho.Id receive earl^consideration and before the general Post War plans for imporeement of lights in the Persian Gulf are reviewed.

(Sd.) W.R.Hay 20.7.46Efease a«e telegram No. T/237 from P.B^P.G. to Gove runout of India on the subject of the recent accident to an American Tanker on the Shah Allun Shoal near Bahrain, the location of which is shown in the attached chart. The history of the case is that in 1 9J6 BAPCO wrote to us (PZ.4258/36, flagged) suggesting that Shah Allum Shoal should be lighted. Other departments and the Government of India were consulted; the Admiralty replying (PZ.4898/36) that no light was necessary, and tin Goverrment of India that the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Advisory Consnittee (canposed of officials and shipowners* representatives) had unanimously advised against it. This was passed on to the Courpiuiy* s Agent in London, and neither he nor the Company question the decision. BAPCO and ARAMCO and the POLS have been negotiating since 1943 for contributions by the Companies to the FGLS in return for certain services, but there has been no agreement yet; largely owing to the attempt by the Companies to get the services at less than the cost price. BAPCO originally proposed that the TStiffe Bank* Light ship should be moved to Allum Shoal beferw as one of the conditions of the agreement, but withdrew this clause When the Government of India objected that this would merely rob Peter to pay Paul (it now turns out that it was not their lightship anywayJ)• They did not offer alternatively to pay for a light at Shah Allum Shoal or suggest that the PGLS should supply one out of the Companies* contribution. In the meantime the increase in shipping to Bahrain has caused opinions of the importance of Shah Allun Shoal to change. It was surveyed for a light in 1940 (FZ.646V40) and the Engineer-in^Chief, Lighthouse Department at Basra only recently recommended a beacon on the Shoal /(Ext. 1803/46(Ext. 1803/lf6, Page 6 ). Conments are called for from the PRPG, the SNOPG- and H.M. Ambassador, Tebrai* but have 'ifet yet been received. The recoranendation has since gained point by the accident on April 23rd. If the matter is taken up through diplomatic channels, nothing much could happen as - (1) the Shoal is outside Territorial Waters; ( 2 ) it is not uncharted (i.e. the accident may Tie 11 have been due merely to bad navigation); ( 3 ) it is scarcely true to say that the Oil Companies ♦have been pressing since' 1936 . However, a certain general opprobrium might cling to and the Gove rime nt of India for the failure in fact, for whatever reason, to arrange for a navigational aid of this sort in their sphere of influence. If so, the present organization of the FGLS would be largely responsible. It is controlled^at present by the Commerce Department in Delhi, with an Advisory Committee in Bombay, acting through the Port Director at Basra, on which the service is actually based. It is a non-profit-making body supported by dues collected from shipping and it is no doubt limited in its ambition by its need to be a non-loss-making body also, since the Indian tax-payer could noi; be asked to pay for services supplied almost exclusively to American and British tankers. A suggestion for the re-organization of the PGLS,/made by the Port Director, Basra in 4^5 £ was (Ext. 503/46), and it appears from a letter f rom PRPC to the Government of India at Ext. 1427/46 that certain business interests in the Gulf favour control frcm London instead of Delhi, with.the Advisory Conmittee * meeting at Basra or elsewftfere *at the Gulf under the Chairmanship of SNGPG. /It1 ^. we have been led to look again into the organization of the Persian Gulf Lighting • . . . '-k - C -* • v ' V “ ' '** ' -» Service, We wondered if you had had any comments from the Political Resident on your demi- official letter No, D,852-F0I^t£ of 1st t ^ w 4V^** [A '. March, or had considered the suggestion, I t (reputed to be current among certain business men in the Gulf) that the control of the PGLS should be transferred to London and the Advisory Conanittee should meet in the Gulf, It occurs to us that, apart from the cumbrousness of the present system, of control from Delhi, Banbay and Basra, fce PGLS is probably hampered in schemes of development from its inability to approach the Govenment of Inni* ^ or funds, since the Indian taxpayer cannot fairly be asked to finance new enterprises in this field /for— — for the almost exclusive benefit of British and American shipping* If it were controlled from London, on the other hand, the financing of new capital expenditure might be more easily arranged. May we have your views?

JUFAIR. --j — in view of the recent grounding of the U.S.S.CACAPON on Shah Allum Shoal, it is understood that consideration is being given to moving the light presently located on Stiffe Bank to Shah Allum Shoal. This Company, as well as our friends the Arabian American Oil Company, has always considered that Shah Allum Shoal was a serious hazard to navigation particularly with respect to vessels proceeding to and from Arabian and Bahrein ports, and the mouth of the Gulf and that the Shoals should be lighted. This view Is also taken by the majority of the Captains of ships calling at Bahrein whose opinions the Com pany has taken. With respect to the moving of the light from stiffe Bank to Shah Allum Shoal, the Company does not wish to make a recoiamendation which could be interpreted that we wished to benefit the navigation to Bahrein and Arabia at the ex pense of the navigation to Northern Gulf ports and we leave the consideration of this point to the appropriate officials. However, the company does strongly recommend the moving of the light if it is considered that the moving of the light would not be detrimental to the navigation to Northern Gulf ports. In any event, the Company strongly recommends that a light be Installed at shah Allum Shoal to mark this serious danger to navigation. cci H.B.M. f s political Agent. Aramco PJH-New York.

The optic is to revolve by acetylene gas oy means of raixero.(Vty ( 2 Ch The candle po’vcr which cen be obtained with the type of optic and burner proposed by the Port Director is in the region of 70 to 80 thousand British candles and the optical range of this light-beam is 29 miles in clear weather and 13 miles in misty weather under North Atlantic conditions* Tills light is probably the most important land - fall light in the Gulf of Oman.. It should, therefore, be a very powerful light having an optical range greater than its geographical range. The elevation cf the light is 260 feet above II.if.L., which is placed on a small to : ver 14 feet high* From the navigational joint of view such a high elevation of the ligfrt is not necessary* The question of finding a suitable but a lower site for tho improved light should therefore be borne in mind specially as the approach road to the existing, light as stated in &amp;r* Stevens bn 1 s report ia dangeroua and steep* On a site with a much lower elevation of 150 feet and with a tower 20 feet hi 4* th-’ light would still have a geographical ranco of 20 mllss which is more than adequate'for tfiis station. The installation proposed by the Port drector is not such as the light could be left entirely unattended* Even with an automatic mantle exchanger and a sun-valve the Id not be loft unattended. Such an installation is India but a Apart iron: the question .of snifting the light to a lower level, if the present site is such that facilities for keep ing one or two attendants ( a lightkeeper and a menial) on the station can be provided, the equipment proposed by the Port Director may be found suitable. If, on the other hand, no such facilities can be provided and the light has to remain unattended an equipment which is mere or less comp letely automatic ajsdlthcroughly reliable should be proviaei. The type of equipment to bo selected for this light' can be decided after the points raised regarding the site and attendants have boon carefully examined and settled. In any case, a much more powerful li rht than the existing one is justified for this* station. If a radio-beacon is established at this stationvsee under Radio-baacons) it may be con venient to install a-light with an electric source and the attendants for the radiobeacon could also looMk after the light* The Port Director states that the light may be improved but no immediate action is to be taken as it is situated in Iranian territory. Mr. Stevenson in his report states that the oth order revolving optic is excellent but the source of light is 1o«mpowere* which is a circular wick burner. The power of the light-bee/n cab increased considerably with a brighter source suchiis an acetylene burner, or an incandescent petro leum vapour burner or by an electric lamp, If electricity ia available at the station. The focal height of the light is only 37 feet a^ove H.W.L. and hence the geographical range is only 13 miles. Ihe advertised range in the Light List is 7 miles, which evidently corresponds^to the optical range of the present light. The focal height and the candle-power of the light should be increased considerably tofnake it a more efficient and useful aid to navigation. Vessels proceeding to the yulf from Bombay and Colombo pass close to this light but the range and candle-power being small they would ’pro bably miss it. The Mason shoal which lies about 4 miles westward of this light is a danger to navigation which can be effectively marked by a red sector in the Jask light if it is made sufficiently powerful. The Direcotr’s/Tho Dirac tor 1 :; proposal that the light when lap or ved should be made fully automatic is, however, to be examined in the light of any proposal for a radiobeacon at this station (see under Hadiobeacons;. If a radiobeacon is to be establish ed here for which one or two attendants would be required, there should bo no need for making the new light fully auto matic. The attendants for the radiobeacon can also look after the light. mercury bath. Burners Incandescent oil v pour burner with a 55 m.m. Collodion msntle.

As such, tne present c&amp;nle-jjwor which gives an optical range far in excess of the geographical is is to be installed, the proposed electrification is to be recommended which would also increase the power of the marine ligjit. Hie question of conversion of this marine light to an aero-marine light, I expect, has been carefully examined and if the necessity for an aerial light has been fully establish ed, a combined aero-marine light would certainly be a more economical proposition than two separate lights’- one for marine navigation and another for aerial navigation, with regard to ii,em (2) of the Director’s proposal, it is doubtful whether the existing burner can be retained as a staadyby. Any stand-by installation, if it is to be effective, should be such that switch over from the permanent to the stand-by installation can be effected very quickly.

In fact, a tempo rary liSit, as in the case of Jazirat Farsi, has also been proposed by the Port Director in one of his subsequent commu- nications.

RADIQBKACOii^ As an aid to navigation the radiobeacon has definetely •proved its utility specially whn visibility is bad. In many parts of the world, as for instance, in the U.S.A., Canada,U.K. end Europe numerous radiobeacona have been established and more are oeinf added. Therefore, large vessels daove a certain tonnage are now required to carry on them a direc tion finder. During the world War II a new means of radio location known as Kadar has been devised which threatens to revolutionise the art of navigation. It is not yet, how ever, known how long it would take to perfect and adopt this new device for marine navigation. Radar was kept a well /uarded secret during the war and very little mfonration t has yet been xi released to the public. Fresh research is being carried out on this new device and the question of its wide application to marine navigation is being actively pursued in the United Kingdom and united States of America. Whether Radar, Loran, etc. will eventually and completely replace radio- beacons for marine navigation is a question which cannot be answered definitely at thi s stage, bit some indication to what the answers to this question will be is found in a Memorandum on Radio Aids to arine Navigation recently prepared by the Ministry of War Transport which states as follows MadiufflJfcpgs Nayifca.Uonal. Aida. •Under this heading the Conference has considered those aids which enable a satisfactory landfall to be made by ocean-going ships at ranges from 50-200 miles. Unlike most of the other cases considered, a radio aid was in use before the war in this category in thefonn of medium frequency direction finding, and no valid rea sons have been shown to the Conference for any fundamental change in this type of system. Wartime experience has broufdit to light a number of ways in which the apparatus both on shore and on the ship can be improved, and more rigorous calibration procedures have been shown to produce a worth-while imporovoment in performance. Steps are being taken in the Unr ed Kingdom to ensure that these improve ments are maintained,* •Before the war the chain of marine radio beacons round the British coast was being extended, but progres t wa stopped by the outbreak of war and the existing beacons had to stop operating as the result of wartime rest rictions. With the end of the hostilities the Ministry of War Transport, in consultation with the interewt concerned, is not only taking up again the question of completing the cahin of radio beacons, b;t is also examining propo sals for certain changes and additions to the system suggested by ±st experience. * * However, no large scale proposals for readiobeacons should be launched without care and caution. I shall shortly proceed ± on deputation ex-India when I intend to study at rirs^ hand the application of Radar to marine navigation On my return I shall be in a position to advise whether a chain of radio- beacons should be provided in the Persian Gulf. However, as the question of radiobeacons has been dealt with at some length by the Po-t Director and the Port Radio Engineer, I give below a scheme which, I think, will be found quite ade quate for safe navigation in the Gulf, I am not recormending, at this stage any particular type of equipment which is to be obtained for the radiobeacons but the most, useful type of / apparatus —apparatus as found by experience in the United Kingdom and U.S.A., in which all war-time improvements are embodied, is to be chosen for the Persian Gulf Scheme. I should, however, mention* that radio bearings taken from a distance greater than 200 miles are often 30 inaccurate th* t the longest effective range of radiobeacons is taken to be approximately 200 miles. The'range of high powered beacons sugg sted by the Port Director is therefore too long for practical purpose. Badishaacoafl ikaoai. A high •power radiobeacon with an effective range of approximately 200 miles is recommeiided for Muscat. This can be picked up from a long distance by all vessels proceeding to the Gulf either from India, Ceylon and Africa. Jaak , A medium-nower radiobeacon at this place with a range of 100 milles will help vessels negotiating the narrow neck leading to the Strait of Hormuz. A better site for this beacon is at Has-al-Kiih but as there is already a light at Jask it will be more economical to have the beacon also at Jask. P.B . The above two beacons to be partially grouped for the purpose of taking cross-bearings. A im medium power radiobeacon with 100 mile range toge* ther with a distance finding station (radio signal synchorihsed with sound signal) will greatly help vessels in rounding off the neck. A synchronised submarine sippal may also be added. Sarja h . a nd-fliiiaia A medium power radiobe&amp;con at each of the above stations is recommended. With the help of theabave three beaccrs a vessel will find her position anywhere in the neck of the @ilf between Jezirat Qain and Liftle Quoin. As corss-bearings can be taken on readiobeacons at f Qais, Sarjah and Little Quoin there is no need for an additional beacon at Thnb. But, at a future date if the three beacons mentioned above a^e found inadequate, a small*power radiobeacon may be established on Ihhb Island. Bahrsia If. a modern lightvessel is provided here, it should be equipped with a high»power rsdiobeacon, a distance finding station and possibly also a synchronised submarine sigi&amp;l. ftiahira* A medium-power radiobeacon with 100 mile ranr^e at this station will help navigation at the northern end of the gjtflf / Shatt-al- 4rab— - li - The lightveaael at this station is an ideal place for a radiobeacon. In this connection a reference is invited to Captain Ratty*s note wherein he* mentions that during extensive pre-war experiments between Abadan Radio and shipping in the Cftf bearing from Abadan were found to be 3° to 5° in error. This is only to be expected as large tracks of land and water interpose between snips appraoching the end of the gilf and Abadan. If a modem lightvessel is obtained for Shatt-al^Arabj it should be equipped with a medium-power radiobeacon with a range of luO miles, a distance finding station and possibly also a synchronised submarine sippal. I would also recommend that if the Shatt-al-Arab lightvessel is equipped with a radiobeacon it should be moved further south of its present position and placed near the 10 fathom line so that vessels making for Basra and Abadan may make straight for the lightvessel will, however, have to be marked and buoyed properly so as to cpide vessels on to the entrance to Basra river, Khor Abd Hah and Khor I usa. All the above three beacons, namely, Bahrein, ftishire, and Shatt-al-Arab are to be grouped for the ptrrpose of taking cro ss-bearings. A map showing the proposed radiobeacons is attached. Sd$~ A.N.

In consequence the British Tanker Company, Gass a Deputy Director of the A.I.C#C» » and Ivor Jones the present General Manager at Hbadan, are being lobbied to consider a scheme for control from London to replace that of the Government of India. 2 # The matter closely concerns the Government ^f India and consequently the Gulf and I thoight, therefore, that I might point out that the suggestion by tanker interests is th^t the Advisory Committee acting under London should meet (Paragraph 4 of enclosure) either in Basra, or some other convenient place in the Gulf, under the Chairmanship of the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf. Some dissatisfaction is also felt at Bombay^ being the.. •#. •#» — 2*“the meeting place of the advisory limit*ee vide paragraph 6 of the enclosore. rhis i a pointer that Bahrain should be the seat ox the Advisory Committee, to which force is ,d.ven by the fact that Bahrain is the Head- nuarters of the senior Naval Officer. Vw'vuu owot* 1 Pi nnt mentioned in the intercept. 3 # You will see that in paragraph 4 of my letter No. 635-3 I made a suggestion that Bahrain should be the base for shore estao— lishments and the Lights Tender. Tnis sugges tion is supported in part* and the writer of the note contemplates a base somewhere in the Gulf while the Port of Basra continues, for various reasons, to maintain the vjulf lights. phe writer also notes that there is no legal sanction for collecting fees, but he is wrong when he says that Bahrain shipping does not pay dues. 5. Many of the points raised are technical and outside my sphere, but the estab lishment of an advisory Committee in the Gulf/ tiff vane is a matter which concerns us. Indeed I am inclined to think that we ahould be represented on any newly organised committee meeting in the Gulf. This is particularly desirable if the Agencies are to collect fees, and we shall be directly concerned with the legal position since presumably legal actions arising in the Gulf would be heard in our Courts.

X will you please refer to your demi-official letter No* cLi tea the 26th April 1945 f on the subject of the Persies 1 CSlT Lighting aenrice ? 2* The following are my comments on the points raised by th Port Director Basra:- (i) /u* tlrr* tbyi^i 1 o^y-u (ii) it c-m be expected thr*t the Persian Government will wish to maintain themselves the lights and buoys on the Persian toast and!it is necessary to ask them their intentions &gt;o co-ordinate plans for the post war development of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. The Persian Government will doubtless wish to collect dues in respect of such lights and buoys, and no exception can be tiken to this. It is certain, however, that whatever their intentions may be, they are unlikely to maintain an efficient service, and it is essential, therefore, that plans for Tfeg&amp;a ^jphto should be proceeded with independently of Persian intentions. I have not pot a copy of the dwta Geneva agreement of 1937, and whether the Persian Gulf ports should conform or not thereto appears to be a technical question on which I can offer no useful corn ent. (iii) is I a^ree that ships using the Persian Gulf idghts should help to maintain them in the raanner suggested, but have the following comments to make in regard to the proposed collection of dues by Politiaal Agents :- (a) Such collection can only be made in respect of vessels which call at Arab ports excluding Has T&amp;nur&amp;s it is also difficult to devise machinery for the collection of dues in respect of Route Lights from vessels, other than regular traders, which call at Persian ports only e.g. JasK or Bandar frfrfr Abbas or Bushire. (b) In the event of a vessel refusing to pay dues there is at present no legal machinery to enforce payment. (c) The collection of dues will throw some additional work on Agpnoiee. 3. The present position regarding contributions by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (new Arabian American Oil Company) is given in Paragraph 3 / of the enclosure to Uuke’s demi-official letter No. D.6381418/^5, f{j£ Wa^- dated the 3rd May 1945 to QLe&amp;rjL. 4. Under the head 'LIGHTS TbNDKR' on page 6 of hi« note the Ti'lJL, Port Director ^ ^ should be owns , the P 0 it Directorate _ consideration whether the vessel, the shore establianment and workshop should continue to be based at Basra. To rerroye uhem outside the bottle-neck of the Hooka channel would be strategically sound and there are advantages in basing the tender and its establishment at Bahrain in the middle of the operational area, than at one end. as at present. As the Persian Gulf Lighting bervice is self supporting this'would enable it to be administered directly by the Government of India and not throuA the Agency of the Port Directorate, Basra, as at present. The development of oil fields on the Arab Littoral is likely greatly to increase the tonnage of by ratlrr shippingtl f I# f - - 2 - shippinn, callinR at Kuwait* Bahrain rafid I is T'^nura thereby to reduce the present importance of Basra as compared *ith these ports* The Port directorate* Basra* need then function only as a dues collecting agency m respect of vessels proceeding up the dhatt al lirao* 5* The Senior Naval Officer.

B*D*P *PtQJfoi Pi886HPWim I am desired to enclose a copy of an outline of a scherro for the Tyjat^ar defelopiflaht of the Persian Gkdf Liiiiting Service prepared by the Port Director. Basra* As you will se© the Port Director has raised the following points \~ (i) that the Persian OoTernment should be approached to find out whether they intend to take any steps to ligw their coast or at least re-establish their existing lighthouses at Kais and Bushire# Tf they hare no such intention, it should be ascertained whether they hayc any oblection to grant facilities to the Persian G-ulf fighting SerYics for doing so; Cii) that the Gulf ports should conform to the uniform system of maritime buoyage agreed' upon at Gene y a in 1937; end (iii) that ships using the Persian Gulf lights should help to maintain these lights in a form of organised collec tion of iight~&lt;iuati paid to the Indian GrOYornment. the dues being collected in the following manner : - (a) an annual lurap-sura contribution being recoYered from regular traders; and (b) light-dues baoe£ on tonnage entering the various pprts being collected by Political Agents and paid to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, The Government of India would be glad to receive your views on these proposals, and it would be appreciated if the views oi the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, w ©# the Port Director's suggestions for the improvement of the ligate could be obtained and forwarded along with your remarks* Yours sincerely Sd- ( H.

Any efficient scheoae of navigational must of necessity # 520 include the establishment of aids in Iranian or perhaps other terri tory since the main traffic, route naturally follows the Iranian Coast of the Gulf arid not the Iranian and any scheme which does not embrace these must be considered a compromise and subject to disruption at a later end perhaps not distant date. It is thus considered necessary to approach the Iranian Government on the subject in order to discover wnetner they intend to take any steps to light their coast or at least ^..establish their existing lighthouses at Bushire and Kais, T f not, ^nen discover their reaction to a su ggestion that we be granted facilities for doing so. This, of course, must be acomplished through Political or diplomatic channels. Their pre-war intention was to establish and operate their own svstem fif marine lighting and this J![fed proceeded as far as the estab lishment of an aero-marine light at Bushire and a marine light on Kais Island, the approach to Bandar Shahpour was buoyed and lighted, seventeen stations were established there and a plsnl was erected at action on our up the Gulf to )art to provide Basrah or Bandar it would have rendered superfluous any *ide£ for shipping using the main route u*. — -- Shahpour except perhaps for the Shatt-al-Arab Lightvessel, Quoin and Muscat, 'fhis is why it is considered nedessary to app&gt;roach them on the subject* With regard to future needs therefore, of course, developments which may necessitate the lighting and buoyage of sc.all ports and the time would appear to have jrome when we should differentiate between what may be called the primary and secondary lighting of the Gulf. The primary would be the mam route from say Muscat up the(Gulf to Basrah along which meit traffic is anticipated. The secondary scheme would be the approach to ports such as Bahrein, Koweit, etc. It would appear preferable to allow the latter subject to remain in abeyance until such time as the developments of these ports have crystallised except for one thing which is the unification of the system. A questionaire was issued to a number of Masters of regular &lt; traders to Basra and their views have been embodied in this outline. t UNKMl SYSTEM QF BUOYAGE. The port of Basrah conforms to the uniform system agreed upon at Geneva in 1937 and tne port of Bandar Shahpour have, since the temporary control of the military also aadKii made changes in this direction, but it would bef difficult to define the system in operation in the Gulf, say, at tatiQ the approach to Bahrein. If Ind^’a conform to the 1937 Unification System either later&amp;l or cardinal or a combination of both then obviously the Gulf should come into line, if not. then the Advisory Board should decide. My own view is that the Gulf Forts should conform to the 1937 system and so obtain complete unity, agreement should be reached on the subject. At the same time we should endeavour to obtain some measure of decisive control wneref commercial concerns and others may erect aids to navigation as in the C.A.S.O.C. at Tannura. In this case they did submit characteristics to us for approval, but we may not meet such courtesy in others. .UMIB&amp;ILt It was at the twenty-fifth session of the International Commission for Air Navigation in Paris in 1937 that Lighthouse Authorities were asked to consider the needs of * ircraft in new construction.

I discussed this matter on my recent visit to Tehran both with His Majesty’s Minister and with Mr. Rice of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 3. There appears to have been a certain amount of misunderstanding. I am not in a position to negotiate with the Persian Government on the subject of the light dues pay able by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. This is a matter that must be dealt with by His Majesty’s Legation. Actually I understand that all light dues due up to date have been paid and that as they are comparatively small the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company are now willing to continue payment so long as the lights concerned continue to function under the control of the Persian Government. 4. I am, however, concerned with seeing that the local Persian authorities continue to maintain these lights in a proper condition, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company may be informed in general terirs that I am doing what I can to this end and that the Bushire and Qais lights are at present functioning satisfactorily. They may also be told that the lights are electrically illuminated but that kerosene is required for the dynamos. At present this kerosene is being provided by the Company here on a guarantee of payment given by this Residency. 5. For your own information I would add that I am trying to arrange for the ’Nearchus’ to inspect both the lights Captain A.L.A. Dredge, I.A., H.M.

I understand that both lights are electrically illuminated and operated, the former from the tov/n mains, and the latter from a generating plant. The one at Bushire is believed to be semi-attended and that at Kais Island fully attended. I am informed that a French Company —Barbierre Bernards — supplied both lights, but that the electrical equipment and motors are not insulated against tropical usage. A further important point which I wish to ascertain is whether these lights are equipped with alternative acetylene or other gas in case of failure of the main illuminant. Any information you can give me as to the degree of reliability I can place on the Persian authorities main taining these lights in a satisfactory state in the future would be much appreciated.

(2) Pov/er is obtained from 2 (each) generators. (3) Both lights are fully attended. (4) Both lights were obtained from the French Company - Barbierre Bernards - and are. insulated, though not efficiently, against tropical usage. (5) Neither of the lights can be operated by gas or acetylene. 2. Should further information be required it is under stood that, provided they were given previous notice through this Consulate General and a copy of the inspection report, the Customs authorities at Bushire would welcome an inspection by an officer of the 'Nearchus*. 3.

It is doubtful, of course, whether they have the technical facilities necessary, and the only satisfactory arrangement would appear to'be for all the Government of India in lights in the Gulf. It is 'id 11 be the outcome of the the events of 25th August. With regard to dues we shall shortly receive a further claim for the period beyond 21st September last, und are,' therefore, most anxious f^r the position -o be cleared up as soon as possible. The light dues are collected by virtue of a law which is still m -oice, -n there appears to us to be no reason why we should go on waving for services which are not being rendered. Our Tehran office has not replied to our neaorandutn except by tc1e 0 ram vhiel reads as foliowt:- •*t ution suggests all questions s: ould re taken up primarily with Political Resident, Bushire who appears to be under the impression that only difficulty is supply of Ma!

The reference to kerosene is not understood. Presumably all Bushire lights are gas burning, and v/e a pov/er plant on that island, but this Acetylene gas has in the past been where there is a plant, which also on the Caspian. worked by seems doubtful.

Against this we have a guarantee deposit with the National Bank of Iraq Dinars 443.765 to cover two months* dues, which is more than sufficient at present exchange to meet this. provis course yuea i p ayabl in the fair t lug the position in respect of the Iranian light*. The ion of further lights by the Iranian Government ,can, of be ignored under present conditions, and so far as rnor s concerned the lights there should be regarded as part Port Conservancy and, therefore, maintained out o. dues e by ships actually using the Port. This is the position Shatt-al-Arab. It will be understood that it is only o charge a vessel for the many lights necessary in the waterways of a . JL J. U w ^ - — Tort when it has the use of them.

Bombay concerning the relieving of the Kais Island Light-vessel by the Unattended Light-vessel now stationed at entrance to the Shatt-al—Arab after the latter has been drydocked and repaired. T also enclose a note from Caot. Snelgrcve, Commander of the 'Nearchus' reporting a conversation he had at Bushire with an Iranian Naval Officer about the exhibiting of the Iranian New Kais Island Light in the near, future. When that takes^ place we will be asked to shift the Kais Island Light vessel. From another source comes information that when the light is exhibited from the New Kais Island Light House, the Iranian authorities will again make an offer for the present Kais Island Lightvessel in order to place it on Stiffe Bank; and \ from the same source that the Iranian authorities are now collecting a light due at Abadan on all incoming ocean vessels I also enclose reports on the Shah Allum Shoal which had been previously reported as being unsuitable for stationing a Light-vessel. The more recent reports however indicate that a safe anchorage exists and I am arranging for this shoal to be resurveyed to make certain before taking any further action. Tn view of the early possibility of the light being exhibited by the Iranian Government from their Kais Island Lighthouse, it might be considered advisable to shift the Kais Island Lightvessel to Stiffe Bank for a period and later on to Shah Allum Shoal which, in the meanwhile, could be marked by a large buoy if considered necessary.

The Kais Island Lightvessel is now 27 years old and requires much more careful watching than in the past and it is therefore recommended that change round now be made. You are aware that the unattended light vessels in the Gulf have nroved to be most reliable. For your information I enclose a report on the Shah Allum Shoal which is considered dangerous enough to be marked by a Lightvessel especially with the development of Bahrain. Inis shoal has, however, been reported as being unsuitable icr a. Lightvessel owing tc depth of water, i.e. 19 fathoms and being strewn with large Boulders. However, early in 1^3 r: instructed the Officer Commanding 'TTearchus', tc again sound over this shoal and his reoerts are attached from which it apnears that a suitable anchorage for a lightvessel actually exists. Before however proceeding further the Officer Commanding 'Uearchus' has been instructed tc re-sound the area and in order to enable this tc be done within a reasonable period an echo sounding machine has been fitted up on board and she will carry cut this survey in due course when a further reuert will be made.

Submitted. SHAH ALLUM SHOAL. In accordance with Sailing Orders, 'Nearchus visited and anchored about one mile SW of Shah Allum Shoal on the 30.3.39. Numerous soundings proved the sea bed to he cf sand, shell, and rock. With regard to establishing a light marking tms snoal the following remarks are submitted for consideration. 1. Owing to the exposed position of the shoal I do not consider a light buoy would be satisfactory. During heavy weather high seas would break over the buoy with danger of damaging the lantern and extinguishing the light. The buoy would also be continually dioping in a heavy swell. jf 1 the lighted beacon now being built on Rennie Shoal which is similarly exoosed, proves to withstand the weatner. satisfactorily, consideration might be given to building a similar beacon on Shah Allum Shoal. 3. I submit the present Kais Light Vessel could be withdrawn cr replaced by a light buoy and then placed in the position of Bahrain Light Vessel, the present Bahrain Light Vessel, the light of which is visible a good 12 miles, then established, on the bank SW of Shah Allum Shoal in 10 fathoms. I amof the oninion that a Light Vessel moored in this position with nine length of l^ n cable and a 2 or 3 ton Admiralty pattern anchor would be quite safe. A 12 mile light in this position wcul serve all vessels to and from Bahrain and the Snatt-Al~/U ab river Vessels nroceeding direct to Shatt-al-Arab Ligh Vessel from Tumb island and making Shah Allum Shoal en route /wouldwould steam an additonal distance of less than 10 miles in a total distance of more than 400 miles. The removal of Vpis Lirht Vessel would not interfere witn uhe navigation of vessels Westbound hut Eastbcund vessels would still require a light at Kais Island or preferably on one of the Farur Islands.

UL O &lt; D I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the British firm of Gray, Mackenzie and Co., have received from the Customs Administration, Khorramshahr, a notification that, as from the 'beginning of the year 1319, a fee of Rials -/(36 per ton on nett registered tonnage is oe collected from all steamers calling at Iranian * as charge for establishing and maintaining lights in the Southern oorts, and that this fee is to oe collectea n foreign exchange. This notification is presumably based on Article I of the Supplementary Law to the Budget for the year 1319. 2. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie are agents in Iran for the British India Steam Navigation Company. This Company is compelled by Iranian regulations to collect in Rials al passage money paid by passengers embarking at Iranian ports, and also all payments for freight of cargo shippe between Iranian ports. It thus has in Iran a large balance of Rials which, owing' to Iranian exchange re S u Ia't 1 °^ a &gt; cannot tie converted into foreign currency. Applications to the Exchange Control Commission for the grant ot foreign exchange have been without result. 3. Your Excellency will therefore agree that in these circumstances Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie cannot be expected to meet the demands for foreign exchange in respect ox light dues payable on behalf of the British Steam Navigation Company unless permission is given for the i foreign exchange of a corresponding portion cl the Company Rial assets in Iran, sufficient to cover the demands made by the Iranian Customs authorities.

I. 2nd May, 1940 Sir With reference to Foreign Office letter E 3926/27/34 of the Mth July, 1938 enclosing a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the subject of lighting and buoying in^ the Persian Gulf I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India a copy of a further despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran regarding a supplementary law to the Iranian budget for the year 1319 (from the 22nd March, 1940, to the 21st March, 1941), dealing inter a lia with this question. 2 0 Article I of this law, to which Sir Reader Bullard draws attention in the second paragraph of his despatch, is as follows: ,f Article IEn vue d f assurer les frais d’entretien 'et completer les projecteurs et phares des ports du 'Sud et des signalisateurs lumineux ou non, ainsi '1’amortissement du capital pour^l f achat et ^installation 'de ces appareils, h. partir du debut de I’annee 1319 ^ '(21 mars 1940) le Ministers des finances est autorise 'a percevoir une taxe de six (6) dinars en devises par 'tonne nette enregistree pour tous navires qui passent 'sur le littoral ou dans les ports de l 1 Iran 'fonctionnaires des douanes lors de 1’arrivee du navire 'au premier port iranien et son montant sera uniquement 'reserve aux depenses sus-precisees. 'Remarque 0 Sur proposition du Ministers de la 'guerre et approbation en Conseil des ministres, le 'montant de la taxe sous-precisee peut §tre modifie en 'proportion du nombre des phares ou des signalisateurs 'en action ainsi que le total general du tonnage des 'navires qui viennent aux rives ou au ports du pays.' 3. The institution of this tax on shipping, the proceeds of which are to be used to cover the cost and maintenance of lighthouses and beacons, is a measure which has been foreseen for several years past, and it may therefore be well briefly to recapitulate here the recent history of this question, 4. In 1933 the Iranian Government indicated that it was their intention to manage the lights and buoys on the Iranian coast themselves. In November 1934 they notified His/ The Under-Secretary of State India Office* OOPY SENT BY AIR MAIL of &gt;k - ^° ^ .fjgf •His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran that their experts had examined the lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf and that arrangements were being made, not only to keep up the present marks, but to instal new ones. They asked that the management of the lights on the Iranian coast and in Iranian waters should be handed over to Iranian officials as soon as the necessary arrangements had been made, 5. In March 1955 the Iranian Government were informed that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom willingly agreed to these proposals, but it was pointed out that, as the lights in question had hitherto been managed as part of a unified system in common with other lights throughout the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea,the matter required careful preliminary consultation between the various authorities concerned, 6 . It was at that time the object of His Majesty’s Government: (a) To negotiate a comprehensive business settlement for the transfer at a fair price of the lights and buoys, which belonged for the most part to the Persian Gulf Lighting service of the Government of India, and (b) To obtain, if possible, some form of undertaking that the Iranian Government would levy dues for the maintenance of their'new system on a reasonable scale* 7. Agreement was finally reached regarding the purchase of the lights, etc., and the Iranian delegates stated that the Ministry of Finance had given a formal assurance that dues would not be levied at a rate greater than was necessary to cover the costs of operation and of the amortisation of the capital invested. His Majesty’s Government desired, however, to obtain a written undertaking to this effect and when, in March 1936, the revised text of a protocol for the transfer to the Iranian Government of the lights, etc., was communicated semi-officially to the Iranian Government, a suggested draft exchange of notes, containing assurances from the Iranian Government that, inter alia , dues would not be levied on international shipping at a rate greater than v/as necessary to cover the expenses of the lighting service, was at the same time communicated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 8. In their semi-official reply of the 20th June 1936, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Iranian Government could not give any formal undertaking on this point, as they regarded the levying by any government of taxes, dues or other imposts as a matter which fell exclusively within the competence of that government. Nevertheless the policy of the Iranian Government was to fix their charges in relation to their expenditure, and they would in no way regard such charges as a source of revenue. 9. In August 1937 the negotiations for the conclusion of the Protocol were abruptly brought to an end when the Iranian Government intimated to His Majesty’s Legation that they would henceforth undertake responsibility for the necessary installations and requested immediate steps to be taken to remove//% remove the lights and buoys belonging to the Persian Gulf Lighting service. ' , 10. Although early in 1938 a communication was received from the Iranian Government regarding certain other aspects of the question, no assurance in writing about the limitation of dues to the amount necessary to cover the operating costs and the depreciation of the lights and buoys in service v/as receivedo In May, 1938, His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires at Tehran was informed by the Foreign Office that it was considered that no useful purpose would be served by pressing the Iranian Government any further at that stage. But Mr. Butler was given discretion to address to the Iranian Government an acknowledgment of the assurance giy® n ^ em informally on the 20th June, 1936, in regard to the light dues. In his reply of the 17th June, 1938, Mr. Butler suggested that it would be difficult, after the lapse of two years, to acknowledge the assurance given so long ago, and. this view was accepted. The assurance had, however, been restated in a letter of the 13th March, 1937, from the Counsellor at His Majesty’s Legation to M. Ansarie, Head oi the Third Political Department of the Iranian Ministry ol Foreign Affairs, and this might perhaps be regarded as constituting an informal and semi-official acknowledgment of the assurance. 11. Lord Halifax would be glad to learn whether the new tax has, in Lord Zetland’s opinion, been fixed at a reasonable level and whether the shipping interests^affected have any observations to make thereon. His Lordship has no information at present as to the ports at which the tax will be collected, or the manner of collection or as to the way in which it will affect the Anglo-Iranian Oil company. 12. A similar letter is being addressed to the Ministry of Shioning and copies are being sent to the Admiralty, treasury and'petroleum Department. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,(No. 91 E.) _ My Lord, Tehran, March 27, 1940. WITH reference to my despatch No. 74 E. of the 11th March, in which details of the Iranian budget for the year the 22nd March, 1940, to the 21st March, 1941, were reported, I now have the honour to transmit to your Lordship a copy of the supplementary law to the budget published in the Journal de Tehran of the 19th March.(') The law was ratified by the Majliss on the 19th March. 2. Article 1 of the law provides for a tax payable by all vessels approaching the sea coast and ports of Iran. The tax is 6 dinars, in foreign exchange, per registered ton, and the proceeds are to be used for cost and maintenance of lighthouses and beacons. 3. Further taxation is notified in article 7 affecting bicycles and tricycles of adults, and in article 8 in connexion with electric light, which is replacing the consumption of oil. There is nothing of outstanding interest in the remaining articles. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade, and to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department. I have, &amp;c.

Early in the year a note was received from the Iranian Government, regarding questions arising in connexion with the installation of new lights in the Persian Gulf. In some respects this communication was not unsatisfactory. Thus the note said that instructions had been issued that whenever a new light or buoy was installed, a warning notice would be published. But as a reply to the representations which His Majesty's Legation had been making on the general question of lighting and buoying in the Gulf, it was disappointing. The only part of its contents applicable to the general question was the repetition in writing of the assurance already given orally that no steps would be taken for the removal of an existing light until the light to replace it was completely ready. Even this was a little ambiguous, seeing that removal devolved upon British authorities. No answer was given regarding three points which had been raised semi-officially, namely, co-operation with the Bombay Lighting Committee of Shipowners, the dues to be paid by Admiralty oilers, and the limitation of dues to the amount necessary to cover operating costs and the depreciation of the lights and buoys in service. Nor was there any reference to a suggestion which had been made to the Iranian Government to the effect that the details of the new arrangements to be made might be settled by a meeting of qualified experts on both sides.am 20. Tne Foreign Office did not feel that any useful purpose would he served by pressing the Iranian Government either as regards the above three points, or as regards the suggestion of a meeting of experts. On the latter point they were mindful of information received from Sir John Ward, who was of the opinion that the Iranian Government would never consent. Sir John Ward also explained that the lights which were being erected by the Iranian authorities had been supplied by reliable firms, and that great care had been taken in their selection. 21. In 1937 His Majesty’s Legation, on instructions from the Government of India, had asked that further particulars, namely, the height above high-water and the candle-power, should be given in notices concerning lights. The Iranian Government eventually agreed to this, part of the long delay being due to the fact that they lost the relevant papers for about five months. In their reply, which was not received until September, they also agreed that one month’s notice would be given before a new light entered into service. They also referred, rather vaguely, to the proposed meeting of experts in tecnnical questions, and admitted that such discussion might possibly from time to time be arranged.INDIA OFFICE RECORDS MICROFILM</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00014b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3765</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00014b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3765</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/49(3) 'Persian Gulf.
