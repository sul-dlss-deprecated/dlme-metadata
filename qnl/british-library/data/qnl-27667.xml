T ''£ Consul, I 'us cat • 7 To The Secretary to the Hon Mole the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• Sir, I have the honour to state that His Highness the Suit, n celled on ne last nignt in order to discuss the future education of hio son Saeed. Saeed Y :ho is 16 years of sr~e has 'been e pupil at the I.Tayo College, Ijmere, sine 1922. His Highness while very grateful for the care and attention 'bestowed on him there considers that the time has now arrived for his removal to an Arab school in an Arabic speaking country. 7 Sayid Saeed while at Ajinerf|has nad tne advantage of the instruction of Khan Bahadur Scdiq Hassan but His Highness ex plains that although this gentleman is in every way an es timable companion, he is not an Arab and his pronunciation end teaching of Arabic is that of a foreigner. His Highness hopes that Sayid Saeed will one day be called upon to rule over sn^ Arab state and opines that it would be s greet dis advantage if his education had been wholly Indian, Sayid Sseed left Muscat to return to school a day or two after my arrival so I am not in a position to give s personal opinion as regards his knowledge of the Arabic language, butV but I understand from I r. ^hornas tnat his Arabic is ind'eed extremely poor for ■. youth of his age end station in life, Mr. Thomas tells me that he.was astonished at his lack of knowledge of words in fairly common use. Such 'bein^ the case 1 recommend tnat the question of Sayid Saeed's future education ma# receive very careful con sideration. 2 his ilighness would prefer tnat his son should proceed for one year to some school in Cairo selected by the British G-overnment. He prefers this to the alternative of a school in Baghdad as he considers that Cairo being the intellectual hub of the l-ahomedan world, offers a more broadening education than the comparative parochialism of Baghdad. Tf however the British Government would prefer s Baghdad education to that offered by Cairo His Highness says he is willing to bow to their decision. His Highness informs me that the curriculum at rayo College permits of a. pupil leaving tne school- nost suitably in December and he would accordingly like to withdraw his son next•Chr i stmas. Sadiq. Hassan's extended term of service under the Huscat State expires on 23rd November 19^6 and His Highness consio-ers that it will not be necessary to prolong it as he proposes uo utilise tne services of his Secretary Khan Bahadur Ahmed Shubaili as his son's tutor# 3 Tf the Resident and the Government of India are prepared to approve the withdrawal of Sayid Saeed from the T'ayc College next December X recommend that the selection o^ £ suitable Arab school may be taken in hand at once as - do not consider it desirable that he should remain idle at r.uscat for any length of time. 1 hope that while this question is under consideration it may be possible uo arrange xor a more n*. modest scale of expenditure than^Hs.15,000 yearly which is now allotted for his education and maintenance. ihe cono-ition of the Muscat finances calls for the exercise of all economy consistent with the maintenance of Sayid Saeed in a state. * ■state befitting his rank# QlC) Hie 'i^hness is of course right in considering Cs-iro t.s superior to Bf.^hd^d fr-n c I'ahomedan educational point of view but the anti iiritish tendencies of certain powerful -l-nents 1 the Egyptian capital may lead u-oYernnent to aecide that it is not a suitable ^lice of residence for the probable heir to the Muscat Sultanate. Jr'or tnis reason 1 tnink a more suitable school Trould probably oe found in ±5a^hdad. '^a-id 3aeed v/no was born on 13tn August 191C hts now reached an age at which i think he may suitably receive a more specialised instruction in the language, history and literatur of the Arabs than he can be expected to obtain at a.College designed primerily for the education of the sons of Indian rulers.

In this letter His Highness sets out his wishes in detail. After several conversations with His Highness on the subject,I have formed the opinion that he is so opposed to the suggestion of sending his son to Beyrout School that itj^ would be better to drop it and to endeavour to find a suitable school in Baghdad. 2, It will be seen that His Highness is prepared to keep Saiyid Saeed at the Mayo College till the end of the school year and wishes to send him thereafter to an Arab school for one year only to complete his Arabic education.

But if there is no school there under the supervision of the British Govt, and if ^ -.anil —act contrary to thiocx the views of the Political Officers, then no matter, we will not send him to Egypt on this condition. Then we agree to send him to Baghdad. My Our object in sending him to an Arabic Schol is to complete his A ra bic lessons with graminar i for a year only. We have explained to you our views about his leaving the Ajmere school. It rests n on the opinion of the Sbmost Principal ( of Mayo College) Ajmere, ^ov too agree to this view. If the Principal does not see it advisable to take away the boy from the school in the month of December 1926, and it is better to get his discharge in April 1927 , then no matter, we agree to the proposal 0 We have no objection to that, but on condition that the Govt permits K^an Bahadur Saijtid Siddiq Hasan to accompany the boy till April 1927, Nodoubt that the Govt will allow that* It is not hidden to you that we require his services till then. But after the boy is discharged from the Ajmere school and is sent to an Arabic school, we will depute with him somebody whom we trust and whose companionship k you will approve.■■n Ue have firm hope that you will subirit our request to . future our friend the Govt of Great Britain about the Itobrir of Khan Bahadur Saiyid Siddiq Hasan, after his return from our service where he was deputed temporarily to accompany our son during his stay at the Ajmere school,,» We request and wish that he may return to a post inside India, It is not hidden from you that he complains of loss.

Letters discuss his education at Mayo College, Ajmer in a school for the sons of Indian rulers. The Sultan, Taimur bin Faisal [Taymūr ibn Fayṣal] wished him to attend a school suitable for Arabs, partly to improve his Arabic. The American Missionary School in Beirut was considered by British officials but the Sultan felt this was not suitable. Letters discuss a school in Baghdad and necessary arrangements such as the rent of a house.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Sa'īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Education</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00019b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
