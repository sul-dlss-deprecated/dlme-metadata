Your Excellency will be pleased to know that reports have been received from all but two of the central sections and adminisirati ns. It appears that repoitinrf procedure has now been definitely established, although much remains to be done before our reporting will be as compltte and informative as it should be. It is a pleasure to commend the heads of the administrations sections and departments for the progress that has been made in this connection. General Organization Two important proposals have been made in the Parliament which, if adopted, would have far-reaching and disturbing effects on the progress of our work. The first proposal was that the Ministry of Finance should suomit to the Parliament within two months a projeci of law prescribing the organization of this Ministry and the positions to be allotted to e^ch subdivision. Such a law would freeze our organization in the midst of an emergency, when the future policies of the Government are in many respects still undecided. While we have made much progress in the reorganization of the Ministry, both in the centei and in the provinces, much remains to be done; and it would be a mistake to hurry this process or to attempt at this time to adjust the work of this Ministry to any fixed and unchange able pattern. What is true of the organizational structure is true also of the positions and personnel within the structure. Ihe number and kind of positions will necessarily change as the volume and type of work change; and these will change as the poli cies of the Government change and as the procedures within the Ministry change.2 - The other proposal was to repeal the Law of 13 Ordibehesht i322, the lawj^ under which we conduct our operations in connection with grain-collection and food-supply, foreign trade control, procurement and distribution of monopoly goods, road transportation, and rent control. This law teiminates automatically six months after the end of the war in Europe. If it were to be repealed now, the economic activities ot the Government would have to be conducted under old laws that are inadequate for present needs and unfitted to the future requirements of Iran. The result would be administrative disorganization and undesirable eco nomic repercussions. Evidently, it is necessary to review all existing economic legislation and prepare new projects of law to meet the post-war situation. We have submitted a proposal to the Prime Minister for the setting up of a commission to do this essential task. Cereal collection has proceeded satisfactorily during the month. Stocks, con tinue to increase and are at the highest point ever reached. Prices have reacted to the favorable grain situation, and over much of the country free market prices are as low as, or lower than the fixed Government prices. The recent freeing of grain transport has lowered the bread prices in Tehran and elsewhere and eased demands for Government isuesof grain and flour. The latter effect tends to improve the stock position. Bread prices on the free market in Tehran have fallen from 2 j rials per 3 kilos to lb rials per 3 kilos. The market has recently reacted to the stoppage of transport from the North and has reached 18 rials per 3 kilos. According to figures received to date (mostly as of 15 Mehr), the total quantity of engagements received amounts to 214,425 tons, and the total grain collected amounts to 113,257 tons. This may be compared with the figure of 265,336 tons for total engagements as of 1 Aban 1322 and 109,772 tons representing total grain collections as of that date last year. On 1 Aban 1323, the stock of the Tehran Silo was as follows: Cereals and Bread Wheat Barley 16,161 6,727 Ordinary flour Barley flour 000 flour 3,015 496 2,428 274 1,932 12 Corn Millet Millet flour Total 31, 045 tons./'■'S % 3 - Stock of the Tehran suburbs, as of 1 Aban, amounted to: r'S Wheat 4,918 Barley 3,914 Other cereals 356 Total 9,188 tons. Provincial stocks, as of 20 Mehr 1323, were: Wheat 68,183 Barley 45,152 Other cereals 469 Total 113,804 tons. This gives a grand total of Tehran and provincial stocks (approximately as of 1 Aban 1323) amounting to 154,042 tons, divided as follows: Wheat (and flour) 85,271 Barley 65,723 Other cereals 3,048 Total 154,04z tons. This should be compared with total stocks as of I Aban 1522, which amounted to 64,580 tons. Funds expended by the Cereals and Bread Section during the month of Mehr are as follows: Department Adminisbative and Funds Sent to Exploitation Expen Provinces ses, Tehran and Provinces Total Cereal RIs. 10,422,632.30 RIs. 246,721,451.95 RIs. 257,144,084.25 Rice 365,200.00 300,000.00 665,200.00 Tea 98,787.05 22,000,000.00 22,098,787.05 City Bread 437,200.00 437,200.00Quotas and Licensing The Foreign Trade Control Division made progress during the month in fi!l-0 ing outstanding quota balances, notably in the items of paper, food, chemicals, rayon-yarn, window-glass, and pharmaceuticals. The situation regarding quotas and imports is far better than it was a year ago. But it should be borne in mind that a substantia) increase of imports, or any increase at all, may not be possible this year. For some items, no suitable appli cations are made. Moreover, the existence of a falling or , uncertain market may temporarily discourage imports. Distribution of Monopoly Goods At the beginning of Mehr stocks of sugar in the country totalled 11,436 tons, and shipments amounting to 8,000 tons were received during the month. Orders issued for delivery to distribution points amounted to 6,306 tons. Foreign tea stocks at the beginning cf the month are reported as 6,^09 tons. We received during the month 87o tons, and delivery orders were issued for 612 tons. Piece-goods on hand at the beginning of Mehr amounted to about 9,993 bales. During the month, delivery orders were issued for ‘^00 bales. Distribution in the provinces during the month of Mchr has been satisfactory. While we do not have complete information, we shall review briefly the activities of each Ostan so as to give an over-all picture of these improved conditions. Every endeavor is being made to expedite distribution of goods. Reports from Ostan i show that during Mehr 843 bags of tea and 84 bags of sugar were despatched to outlying districts to complete the 3rd program, and 2,74i bags of sugar were shipped against the 4th program. During Mehr 150 bales of piece-goods, nearly 72 tons of tea and more than 682 tons of sugar were distributed in the outlying areas of Ostan 2. In Tehran distribu tion for the months of Mehr and Aban is to be made during Aban. Complaints concerning distribution in this province have subsided almost entirely. Unsettled conditions in portions of Azerbaijan continue to hamper or derly process of distribution, particulaty in the Reza«eh area. The situation in parts of Ostans 3 and 4 has been so serious that employees were unable to dis charge their duties. A report has been submitted to the Ministry of Interior, and the assistance of that Ministry has been requested in restoring order. One and one half kilos of sugar and 150 grams of tea are being distributed to each person,also 3 meters of piece-goods. Distribution of piece-goods is reported as follows: Ardabil 350 bales Rezaieh 327 bales Maragheh 374 bales Khoy 43 bales Distribution of monopoly goods in Ostan 5 is reported as satisfactory, end a decline in bazaar prices has resulted. Goods were distributed in Mehr to the in habitants of Hamada^, Malayer, Kermanshah, Sanandaj, and 131 villages., as well as to 17 tribes. In Hamadan 36 tons of sugar and 3.2 tons of tea wue distributed. In Malayer, 167 tons of sugar and 6.7 of tea were given out. Nearly 220 tons of sugar, over 8 tons of tea, and 35 bales of piece-goods were dispatched to Ostan 5 in Mehr. During Mehr the following quantities of monopoly goods were released to Ostan 6: City Sugar Domestic and Foreign Tea Piece-goods Ahwaz 150 tons 33 tons 519 bales Khorramshahr 133 tons 26 tons 467 bales Khorramabad 8j tons 165 tons 300 bales Borujerd 83 tons 16.5 tons 350 bales Golpaigan 33 tons 6.5 tons 100 bales Khomein 16.5 tons 3 tons Distribution during Mehi in Ostan 7 was carried out successfully in the Shiraz, Lar and Bushire areas and to the tribes. Sugar distribution totalled 266 tons in Shiraz, 86 tons in Bushire and 76 tons in Langeh. Sixty-six tons of tea were distributed at the same time. Meanwhile 1,958 bales of piece-goods were moved from Bushire to Shiraz; 322 bales were releaseu in Bushire, and 50 bales were transposed from Bushirt to Langeh to care for piece-goods rations. Continuing attention is being given the problem of distribution to the tribes. Satisfactory distribution is reported from Ostan 8, although no details are given. During the month of Mehr, 980 tons of sugar, 135 tons of tea and 1.245 bales of piece-goods were delivered to the Ostan. Previously a critical situation was reported in Osian 9 due to an inadequate— 6 supply of monopoly goods for dislribulion. To remedy this, during Mehr 134 tons of tea were shipped to the Ostan, while delivery orders for 1,900 tons of sugar from Zahedan and about 78 tons from the Abkooh factory were issued. Confusion over prices, now removed, appeared to be the cause of delay in piece-goods dis tribution. With adequate stocks of all monopoly goods now on hand, improve ment in distribution in Ostan 9 seems certain. Distribution in Ostan 10 had been reported to have been impeded by inade quate supply, and during Mehr special efforts were rmde to expedite shipments to that area. Reports of satisfactory diatrioution during Mehr attest to the success of these efforts. A special telegram of appreciation was received from the Chief of the Bakhtiaries on behalf of some 60,000 trioesmen. During the month, 2,000 bags of tea and 1,000 bales of piece-goods were shipped to Ostan i0, and a rela tively satisfactory stock position was reported as of the close of Mehr. Special attention has been given to the problem of railway workers and their families, and three representatives from Tehran were despatched along the railway lines to determine quotas and make preliminary arrangements for distribution. Two of these representatives have completed their assignments and the third one is expected to return shortly. In Tehran we have so far distributed 637,000 new ration bocks. Arrangements for issuance of the rest of the ration books are almost completed, and localities for distribution have been established. Announcement to the public will be made very shortly. About 500 of the 1,346 suburban villages have been canvassed to date, and the remainder should be completed within 6 weeks. In Ostan 1 a representative from Tehran has been assisting local government officials in the registration and work of coupon distribution, and the work is well on its way to completion. In Ostan, 2, outside the Tehran area mentioned above, a special representative was sent to Qum, and general progress can be reported. Under the leadership of a new Di- lector of Finance for Azerbaijan the interruption in registration and the issuance of coupons in Ostans o and 4 has been ended, and work is once more under way. Registration and coupon distribution are reported substantially complete in Ostans 5 and 6. While registration is being carried out in Ostans 7 and 8, no distribution of ration coupons has as yet been made. In Tehran the operation of the Ferooshgah has been stopped, and liquidation of staff, accounts and inventories is nearly finished. Some 26 Governm nt stores are being opened for distribution of piece-goods. Availability of piece-goods cou- 'll ! k— 7 — pons will be announced within a few days. Two hundred su?ar and tea agents are to be appointed in Tehran, so situated that each will serve approximately 4,000 per sons. During Mehr, 285 places were examined. Road Transport Maintenance of trucks is a vital feature of the operations of the Road Transport Administration and has presented ex f raordiary difficulties. Consequently, the impro vement that has occurred is especially gratifying, and it is a pleasure io give public recognition to Mr. John L. Hurst for his accomplishments in this connection. The following information is abstracted from a report submitted by Mr. Hurst on 22 Mehr 1323 (14 October 1944). The Road Transport Adminstration central workshop was taken over officially from the United Kingdom Comercial Corporation on 7 Tir 1323 (28 June 1944). Since then, production of various motor-vehicle parts has increased In the beginning the quality of work on rebuilt engine production was very bad, and a number of rebuilt engines had to be returned for further repair. Today, how ever, in spite of the lack of much needed equipment, the workshop is turning out the best engine rebuilding jobs ever produced in Iran, in fact, as good as those pro duced in any country. The quality of work in the other departments has beeu similaHy improved. In order fully to round out this particular type of work, a modern crank shaft grinding machine is needed. Such a machine is on order from the United States, but it is uncertain when it will be received. During the latter part of Mordad and the month of Shahrivar, 40 new engines, which came forward with the stock of Dodge parts and supplies from Egypt, have been uncrated, cleaned, and handled through a special, double transmission engine testing and “running-in” apparatus which was designed and built by the workshop itself. These engines had been lying in their cases in Egypt for more than two and a half years, but, due to* careful “running-in”, not a single failure has been reported from those placed in use. A special warning label is being placed on the windshield of every truck turned out with either a new or rebuilt engine. The situation with regard to batteries has been one of the most serious the work shop has had to face, It was necessary to arrange for plates and separators to be made locally and to train a repair crew, which is now functioning well. The entire battery repair and recharging plant will be moved to new and better quarters by themiddle of Aban. The workshop is now fairly well caught up on battery work for l. O. Pool trucks, Government cars, Embassy automobiles, and vehicles belonging to other ministries, and it is hoped that it will soon be possible to accept work for other clients on a CO.D. basis. The radiators on all ford automobiles and trucks in the country are in deplor able condition, and this is responsible in many cases for Ford engine failures. Re cently the workshop designed a new type “honeycomb” assembly to replace the standard Ford “tubular’' assembly. This new assembly is being manufactured by the workshop from sections of old Dodge l.G. truck radiators. When the department of Government-owned vehicles was taken over in March, the front ends of all Government-owned vertical sprung automobiles (such as Chrysler and General Motors products) were in very poor condition. Due to faulty alignment, tire wear on these cars was several times normal expectancy, and seve ral Cars were in such dangerous condition that wrecks resulted. The front ends of 56 of these vehicles have already been rebuilt. Most of the parts used in the re building, some of which are extremely intricate, were made in the workshop itself. The labor situation in the workshop has been much impioved. Personnel ab senteeism which was running about 30 per cent under the previous management, has been reduced to less than 5 per cent. Since 15Tir (6 July) the workshop’s own doctor has been in daily attendance, treating those suffering from illness and from the results of accidents By close supervision and the elimination of working hazards and dangerous practices, accidents and minor injuries, which ran high at first, have been reduced to a minimum. A small restaurant is maintained, where the workmen can obtain their noon meal at controlled prices. The doctor inspects the food and water, and the quality of the food is steadily improving. It is planned to enlarge these facilities at an early date. A store has been set up, where foodstuffs confiscated by the Road Transport Administration are sold to employees, and efforts are being made to obtain a supply of rationed products from the Distribution Section. This is an important service, as the working schedule of the workshop makes it impossible for employees to obtain rationed goods in their own neighborhoods. A combination saw, wood-boring and shaper machine has been designed and built for the carpenter shop. This machine has only recently been put into use and will more than triple the carpenter shop’s production.A sewing machine and upholstery materials have finally been obtained and an automobile upholstering department put in operation. Several jobs have already been completed. After considerable negotiation, a good deal of tool equipment and two electric welders were obtained from the Persian Gulf Command. These have been of great help, and it was hoped that several other badly needed items might be obtained from the same source. Unfortunately this is not possible, due to urgent demands from other war theaters. A satisfactory agreement was reached with the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation on the value of tool equipment, irech. ~ cs’ work benches and other items taken over from them, and these have been paid fo-. The Hercuhs Diesel Generating Set loaned by the United Kingdom Comr e r cial Corporation at the time the Road Transport Administration took ove r the shop has been disassembled, and the engine has been overhauled and returned to them, thus eliminating that liability. Their generator is being used at present on a mobile power plant designed and built by the workshop on a wrecked I.G. Dodge chassis. Since the Corporation does not wish to sell the generator separately, it will be returned to them, as ori ginally agreed, as soon as replacement equipment arrives from America. The old Hille Diesel power plant, which was in very bad condition when the Road Transport Administration took over, has been completely rebuilt and remounted on the proper base. The engine room has been completely redesigned, and the switchboards are now being rewired. The Hille Diesel engine is more than twenty years old, and, since no spare parts are available in this country, it took many tricks of mechanical magic to put it back in running condition. Even now, it cannot be considered a dependable source of power. The lack of compressed air has been one of the m^st difficult problems. The only suitable equipment in the country was the compressor at the Doshan Tapeh Machine-Gun Arsenal, which the Iranian Army said could not be spared. An old, worn-out German compressor was finally obtained from Karedj, but as yet it has not been possible to rebuild it. Another compressor, also olo and worn-out, was bor rowed from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. This compressor had previously been loaned to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, and it, too, must be com pletely rebuilt before it can be used. On 8 Mehr 1323 (30 September 1944) the workshop took C'^er from the Tire Department the issuing of all tires for I.G. Pool trucks, including the tire matching work, which has recently been lagging. The workshop will socn take over the issuing of all tires for Government automobiles. Since the workshop took over the inspection work, 301 buses have been in-- 10 - spected and the owners forced to put them in good mechanical condition before approval was granted. The sum of 1,000 rials was collected from the owner of each bus inspected. Only recently the workshop took over inspection of all Spe cial License trucks, 34 of which have been inspected to date. The setting up of the Stores Department is progressing nicely. The newly re ceived Dodge parts are being taken from Customs rapidly and are being proces sed and binned in an efficient manner. A complete control system has been worked out. Forms have been printed, and, as the parts aie placed in the bins, inventory cards are posted on the spot and the whole sysiem tied in with office control. Job cards have also been prepared and are written up to cover every job. All parts used are covered by store requisitiimns, which, in turn, are double-checked against stock and use. A considerable quantity of Chevrolet parts was purchased from the Lend- Lease Acministration, and, in addition, a good quantity of Chevrolet stock has been taken over from the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and from the deal er, Sherkat Sehami Rahpeym-*. A considerable number of Dodge* Chrysler and Bnitk parts have also been obtained irom the United Kingdom Commercial Cor poration. All have been binned, carded and checked out against invoices. Stocks of steel materials have been obtained frr m the State General Supply Corporation, all of wnich have been accounted for in “stores ’. The Stores Department also handles all used unit reconditioning from truck to shop and in turn back to stock to be issued, against requisitions, to the fi*ter and assembly sections. An excellent time-keeping system has been installed, the proof of which is that, on the day following the close of the month, employees are paid without any confusion and with surprisingly few errors. With more than 300 employees and only one timtketper, this is no easy task. The office staff consists; of one office manager, one timekeeper, one requisition clerk, one job card clerk, one progress clerk, one stores stock control supervisor, and one Iranian typist. In spite of the fact that the Office Manager supervises all ou.side purchasing and spends several hours each evening in the market with representatives of the Stores Department, all otfice work is up to date every day. The Road Transport Administration further reports that no significant change occurred during the month in connection with motor vehicle operations, except that, during the first few days of Mchr, 100 additional I.G. Pool lorries were shif-- ted from various parts of the country into Azerbaijan, to augment the grain col- lecdon and transport fleet already in that territory. A revised and much expanded grain collection and transport program was estab'ished for the Azerbaijan territory early in Mehr, Targets were advanced maLrially over all of the Azerbaijan grain routes. The movements schedule has been satisfactorily maintained and, in some instances, is ahead ot the target. The movement of grain from the North to Tehran J *was seriously retarded by the withdrawal of rail wagons by the Soviet authorities. The reduction of grain scores on hand at Bostanabad and points intermediate to Bostanabad and Mianth in the next few weeks will depend directly upon the number of rail wagons made available by the Soviet authorities. The collection and road transport of grain in the entire Hamadan-Kermanshah area has been stepped up very materially through additional use of commercial road transport. It appears at this time that there is a good likelihood of completing the entire program for that area within the next sixty days, except movements over the all-weather roads, which can be completed in a more leisurely manner. The grain collection and transport program in other parts of the country is on a satisfactory basis. Arrangements were completed through commercial transport for the handling of this year’s sugar beet-root crop from the growing areas to the factories. Opera tions have begun throughout the country, and successful completion of the program will depend upon the private agencies in whose hands it has been placed and upon proper cooperation by the sugar factories. Suffizient transport has been released and made available. There was satisfactory improvement in the amount of tonnage hauled by rail from the South during October in comparison with the previous month and with October of last year. In September 1044, 70 per cent of the allocation was used, whereas, in October i9i4, the tonnage of Government and privately owned goods hauled was within 00 per'cent of the target. The total movement of grain from South and North to Tehran was only 28 per cent of the target during October, due principally to failure by the Soviet authorities to place the wagons required in the Northern Zone. During Mehr a total of 1,966 tons of monopoly goods were shipped out of Tehran Customs and warehouses for disiribution in the interior. With regard to the movement cf Government and merchants goods from the North, Government requirements during Mehr fell short of placings (loadings) by 1,218 wagons; and merchants who applied for rail transportation received none at all out of the 4^8 wagons requested. The Soviet 1 ransportation Directorate advised the Iranian State Railways on or about 23 Mehr 1323 that, until further noiicc, no further wagons would be placed in the North for the transportation of Iranian goods. Loadings were resumed on 10 Abin 13^3 (1 November 194-.). The Soviet Transportation Directorate claim that merchants do not have their loads on hand when the wagons are placed. We are therefore investigating the possibility of an arrangement oy which the presence of the load may be certified by the local Soviet representative and an Iranian State Railways official.- 12 — Tobacco The Administration of the Tobacco and Opium Monoplies reports the start of the purchase of the 1323 crop of ijipe tobacco and waterpipe tobacco in the Third and Fourth Ostans and in the province of Ciolpaigan. Up to the end of Mehr, the follow ing quantities had been purchased: Pipe tobacco 290,314/o40 Kilos Water-pipe tobacco 40,662/050 Kilos The establishment of the new system of distribution of tobacco products lias proceeded smoothly. Distribution is being entrusted to companies formed of local merchants. These companies will be allowed a commission cf 1-1/^. per cent of the total price. The small retailers (sellers) will be those who are at present engaged in the business and who possess permits from the Iranian Tobacco Monoply or from the local finance departments The profits of such tradesmen will be 4 per cent of the price. industrial Supervision The Industrial Supervision Administration has concentrated for some time on an effort to increase the production of the various factories. Available statistics indicated that th' plams were operating at a loss. We believe that this loss result ed largely from the fact that production was below capacity, while the labor force exceeded requirements for capacity operation. Obviously, the closer the factories approach capacity, the lower will be the unit cost of goods produced, and the greater will be the income for the Government. It being impossible to study every plant and mine at once, the Industrial Supervision Administration has applied itself to those plants which seemed most important, either from the point of view of gross expenditure or from the point of view of importance to the general economy. * There is indicated here below the change in a three month period at several of the ^ plants: September October November Shahi Weaving Plant (metres cloth per day) 1,200 3,000 5,000 2 Shahi Gunny-Bag Factory Metres Hessian per day 800 2,403 4,000 Bags per day 50 750 2,000 Beshahr Weaving Plant (metres cloth per day) — i 8,000 38,000 Gas Mask Factory (shoes, pair per day) 350 500 800 Sultanabad Factory (cartridges per day) 1,200 50,000 50,000 In each of the above cases, the change for the better has been accomplished by the co-operation of all concerned: the factory managers; the Ministry of Com-merce, Industry and Mines; the Administration of Industrial Supervision; and, in the case of the Munitions Factories, the Iranian Army. No single one of the concern ed parties has been solely responsible for the improvtment in any instance. Steps were taken during the month to establish a single power-plant for the following consumers: The Seed-Crushing Plant The Shahi Spinning and Weaving Plant The Shahi Gunny-Bag Factory The Shahi Conserve Factory Ttie City of Sari 1 he City of Shahi. The thousand or more cases of new textile machinery in a warehouse at Tehran are now under inspection, and steps are being taken to use this machinery or otherwise dispose of it in the interest of the Government. We have cooperated in the revision of the Workmen’s Compensation and Labor projects and in the launching of the new Industrial Management Corporation. Rent-Control The Rents Division has received a total of 6,9j2 petitions, of which 2,587 related to shops and 4,535 to dwelling-places. Unfortunately, the work of the Division has fallen behind to such an extent that it now takes several months for the average petition to be acted upon. We are now setting up another commission of experts in the Division, and it is hoped that all work will soon be hand'ed currently with out delay. Internal Revenue Statistics of tax receipts during the first 5 months of i32o, presented bv the Internal Revenue Administration, show total receipts amounting to 482,392,784 rials, compared with 488,814,694 rials collected during the corresponding period of i322. Duiing this period, income-tax receipts totalled 317,032,458 rials in UC3 and 305,490,946 rials in 13*2. Total tax receipts showed a serious decrease in all of the provinces except Tehran; and income-tax receipts were less in all provinces, except Tehran, Khuzistan, and Kerman. In the last report it was pointed out that the two principal reasons for these decreases were delays in getting the new income-tax law into operation and the annullment of several taxes which last year produced 36 per cent of provincial tax receipts. The difficulties encountered in putting the income tax into operation are gradually being overcome, and receipts during the rest of the year should showconsiderable improvement. Nevertheless it appears doubtful that revenue from this ^ source * ill ue sufficient to overcome the loss of revenue from the abolished taxes. Receipts from excise on alcohol have improved considerably in the provinces as well as in Tehran. Considerable progress was made during the month in clearing up old tax cases and in assessing the tax under the new law. During the month 5,0^9 inspections of business houses were made, bringing the total for the year to 23,190.One thou sand sixty-five tax assessement notices were issued against 1322 income and 583 for tax arrears under the old law. The total amount of tax assessed during the month under the new income-tax law was 56,6/2,1^5 rials. At the end of Mehr, 14,600 individual tax declarations had been received. The agricultural income sur vey commissions turned in 866 inspection sheets for Tehran, and tax assessment has begun. Reports from the provinces indicate that the agricultural survey com missions have been formed and are now operating throughout the country. How ever, numerous sections, particularly Ostans 3,4 and 6, repoit that in many locali ties the surveys cannot b? made on account of rebellious tribes and unsetded con ditions. There are also large sections of land, particularly in the North, adminis tered by the Ceded Properties Administration, from which the income is not tax able under the income-tax law. A fourth appeals commission was formed during the month to hear cases aris ing under the old law, and five commissions were formed to hear cases under the n t w law. On the basis of appeals made to date from assessmen's under the new law, it appears probable that 80 to 90 per ctnt of the taxpayers intend to appeal their assessments. As there are no limitations in the law against appeals to the commissions and no limitations on carrying the commissions’ decisions to the Finance Tribunal, it appears probable that thousands of cases will be tied up tor months ii these two appeal courts, thus preventing any enforcement action to collect the taxes. During the monthunder review the commissions heard 779 cases involving tax arrears. This reduced to approximately 4,000 the number of cases pending, and it is estimated that, with the formation of a fourth commission, they should pass on about one thousand cases u month. Collection of the income tax at Mahan has been particularly difficult The fac tory owners have protested agdinst the application of the new tax against their i32^ incomes, have protested against the amount of tax assessed, and have only made partial pa&gt;ment of the amount of tax due on the incomes they have them selves declared. In spite of all our efforts it was found impossible to come to any agreement with the Ministry of Interior on a tax programme for the municipalities. As the orr posals made to the Ministry inxolvtd the turning over to the municipalities of— 15 — a number of taxes at present collected by the Government and the relinquishing by the municipalities of the tax on petroleum products, which would then be collected for account of the Government, little progress has been made in reduc ing the number of Government taxes and at the same time increasing the Govern ment revenue. Under the present tax laws, some taxes which are primarily muni cipal taxes are collected by the Government, and others, which, due to their appli cation in rural as well as urban sections, should be Government taxes, are collect ed for account of the municipalities. It is still hoped that an agreement can be reached with the Ministry of Interior whereoy the tax programmes of both the municipalities and the Government may be simplified and improved. Finanrial Position In the month of Mehr, ordinary disbursements by the Treasury General were 372,589,000 rials, compared with disbursements amount.ng to *51,114,000 rials in Sfoahrivar. This increase w^s largely due tc the delayed passage of the budget law. Commercial disbursements were 448,544,000 rials in Mehr and 285,653,000 rials in Shahrivar. This increase was due to larger disbursements for purchases of grain, tobacco and imported monopoly goods. Ordinary receipts in Mehr, compared with the preceding month, rose from 118,941,000 rials to 169,161,000 rials, while com mercial receipts declined from 450,217,000 rials to 357,868,000 liJs.

Under the energetic dirction of Mr. Bcrriman and Mr. Bodin, marked progress has been made.Personnel The routine work of the Personnel Administration has been handled satis factorily during the past month. The volume of work has been heavy. The Pension Department has handled 9,76Q cases, and the Personnel Department 6,135 cases, making a total of 15,904 tor the month. Tnere 3*6 no serious accumulations of work on hand in either of these departments, the only cases pending being current work, cases submitted in incomplete form which are now awaiting replies to rciuests for further information, and cases held pending action on proposed changes in regula tions for position allowances and certain types of privileges. Pra :tically the full time of the Director-General and Assistant Director-General and their immegiate staffs has been required in the handling ot individual personnel problems. This work has been of three general kinds: the handling of dossiers, in terviewing employees with individual problems or candidates for positions and conducting of conferences and commissions of staff members on current problems. During the month, ,Vlr. Katoozian was appointed Deputy Director-General of Finance of Khorassan and Mr. Allen, Acting Director- General of Finance of Azer baijan. Mr. Nancarrow proceeded to his post as Director-General of Finance of Guilan. Please accept, Your Excellency, the renewed assurances of my high consideration. A. C. Millspaugh Adminstrator GeneraT of the FinancesTURKESTANSi ^4 •m Report of tlie ADMINISTRATOR GENERAL OF THE FINANCES OF IRAN For the Month of Shahrivar 1323 (August 23-September 22, 1944)&amp; REPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR GENERAL OF THE FINANCES FOR THE MONTH OF SHAHRIVAR 1323 (August 23-September 22, 1944) His Excellency, The Minister of Finance Your Excellency: 1 have the honor to submit herewith my repoit for the month of Shahrivar, L 1323 (August 23-September 22, 1944). \ Your Excellency has reason to feel gratified over the improvement that has taken place in the financial and economic situation. The stocks of grain are the largest in the histoiy of Iran, and we believe that the food supply of the country is assured for the present crop year. The distribution of monopoly goods is now proceeding on a routine basis in accordance with plans made and instructions issued about seven months a&lt;oj and the goods are reaching not only the city populations but also the villagers and tribesmen. The only present causes of anxiety in this connec tion are with regard to the supply of imported goods. Naturally, we cannot distri bute goods unless or until quotas and imports are adequate, and unless shipments of monopoly goods into the country are delivered to and controlled by the Govern ment. The recent fall in prices has eased living condidkions and has been particularly beneficial to the officials and employees of the Government, the favourable change in this respect should improve morale and increase efficiency in the Govern ment administrations. The collection of taxes under the new Income-Tax Law is now well under way. The American Mission does not, of course, claim the whole credit for these developments. Many factors, large and small, have contributed to tikis result.2 It goes without saying that the Government will prepare itself for further eco nomic changes. Some of these will, no doubt, be favorable Other developments and temporary trends may be unfavorable. In a time such as this we cannot hope for quick solutions or for an immediate return to normal conditions. Because of the changes in the situation, we have eliminated or relaxed some of the controls exercised under the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 1322; and w e Pro pose, with the agreement of the Government, to continue as rap.dly as possible (1 the policy of returning trade to normal commercial channels and (2) the po icy o transferring the economic administrative activities of the Government from a tem- nrrrarv in ^ nprmanent basis within the administrative structure of the Government. In accrcance with the second policy mentioned above, and after consultation with Your Excellency and the Government, 1 issued instructions under which the powers given to me in the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 13^.2 will hereafter be exercised in conformity with the provisions of thei-aw of 21 Aban 1321, the law under which I was engaged as Admmistrator General of the Finances and which is consistent with the constitutional requirements pertaining to the responsibility of the ministers. Cereals And Bread The reserve carried over from 1322, as well as information about the first two months cf collection work of the new harvest, indicate that the critical emergency stage of cereals collection and food supply, forced upon the Government in the mid dle of 1321, has now definitely passed—let us hone never to return. It has been consistently the policy of the Government to begin each season’s program with strict regulations rigorously enforced. When the collection programs have progressed to a point where the bread supply of the nation has been secured until the next harvest, regulations may be modified and their enforcement somewhat relaxed. It has also been the settled policy to remove monopoly restrictions as rapid ly as emergency conditions improve. When it became clear that the bread supply of the nation was assured for the remainder of the crop year, certain restrictions upon the free movement and sale of grain were lifted. A regulation has been issued that frees transportadon of grain as of 15 Mehr 13z3. It is hoped that the lifting of these restrictions may be of assistance in promoting free transactions in grain and to a certain extent permitting people generally to be more dependent upon com mercial grain movemenis for their bread supply and less upon Government grain and bread issues. Total stocks throughout the country, as well as stocks in Tehran, are expected to mount during the next few months. This is because the rate of current collection!, as well as of arrivals in Tehran, should, according to schedule, soon exceed current consumption figures. The t rivar, v of * a1 TV\ (3 S The total stipulations received, according to statistics received up to 15 Shah- rivar, were 167,612 tons; and receipts from stipulations, according to statistics as of 1 and 15, Shahrivar, totalled 60,08.'. tons. The stocks in the Tehran Silo on 3i Shahrivar 132^ were as follows: Last year, the total stipulations received up to 1 Mehr, .3 .2represented 208,97 4 tons; the receipts of grain up to 1 Mehr 1322 agg&gt;egated 54,533 tons: and the Teh ran and provincial stocks on a Mehr, 1322 amounted to 44,546 tons. The cash expenditures of the Cereals and Bread Section during the month of Shahrivar are shown below.

Extra typists were loaned from other administrations for afternoon work so that sufficient schedules might be tvped to enable us to have several committees operating simultaneously. The bulk of the applications were screened and the allotment schedules passed to Middle East Supply Centre. Schedules went forward rapidly during the month, and Middle East Supply Centre officers were cooperative in giving technical advice and information. It is interesting to note in this conection that the Anglo-American Licensing Com mittee approved during the month some 960 licences. I am informed that this is nearly double the number passed in any previous month since the Committee has been in operation. With respect to particular quotas, the following comments are of interest. Section “A’’—Food and Drink AH applications in this section were screened and passed to Middle E^ast Sup ply Cen're. Eighty tons of cocoa and 50 tons of pepper still remained provisional in this quota, and replies were awaited from Cairo regarding the final status or these items. In addition a balance remained of over 800 tons of various spices, chiefly in the “Other Spices” category, for which no applications had been received. Section “C”—Oils, Fats, and Soap Olive oil and shaving soap are the only two items in this quota. The olive oil was reserved for the Bandar Abbas Canning Factory, and we understand that the oil will not be required for the current year. Several applications have been received for the shaving soap, but none to date for the loading area specified by Middle East Supply Centre.Section “D”—Chemicals All chemical applications were screened and passed, both for the Government and private merchants. Applications were not received for certain little-used chemi cals, mainly of Palestine origin. Aside from these, the heaviest balances are in the items Sodium Carbonate, 800 tons, and Caustic Soda, 500 tons. These two items were problematical because of the stocks of caustic soda now on hand both in the Glycerine Factory and in the free market, and also because of the potential output of both items by the new government factory. In view of existing stocks and es timated future production we can probably forego a major portion, if not all, of these two quotas, provided of course that production costs in the new factory can be kept at a reasonable level. Section “E’‘—Tanning Materials This section involves material for tanneries and is reserved enirely for applica tions by them or their agents. All applications were screened. Section “F*—Timber and Cork Corks and cork sheeting were screened and passed to the full amount of the quota. The wooden battery separators quota was partl&gt; taken up. The balance to be licensed will be determined by the Road Transport Administration. Section “G”—Paper All private applications were screened after reserves were set aside for the Government. This section reflects one of our largest outstanding balances, all against Government reserves. Scetion ‘H”—Hides, Leather Belting, Shoes The shoe quota in this Section has been absorbed by the Iranian Army purchase in Palestine. The leather belting quota was completed and passed to Middle East Supply Centre. Applications for hides are approved only for tanneries and are passed as ship ments are received. Section “J”—Textiles Work on textiles was completed with the exception of rayon yarn and raw cotton. The second half year’s quota of rayon yarn is still provisional, and word is now awaited from Cairo as to the final decision regarding this item. Section “K”—Non Metallic Minerals This section was completed to the extent of applications received. In March of this year the Palestine Government issued export peimits to cer tain Iranian merchants for one half of the year’s quota of window glass. As a re sult, the licenses which we issued in thefi.st half year completed the year’s quota, and no further licenses can be issued. In this section there is a provisional quota of 2d tons of glassware. With the exception of a small tonnage of baby feeders we have not been able to obtain ap proval for licenses against this item.Section “L”—Metals Of the bulk steel items, all available applications were screened. Out of the quota of 1,610 tons, a balance remained of 48 tons for which applications must be received if the entire amount is to be imported. In the non-bulk section of this quota, there is also a small unexpended balance, but the principal item, tin, has been licensed in full. Section “M”—Machinery and Engineering Supplies The greater part of the tonnage in this section is of a provisional nature, involv ing justification of need before applications can be approved. The Kerns for v/hich we have a firm quota were put forward for licensing. For the other items requiring justification, work will go on more or less continuously during the remainder of the year as applications are received for machinery and spare parts. In this section, in the interest of keeping plant facilities in operation, applications will be received and investigated at any time, regardless of any deadline for the filing of applications. Section “N”—Transport Bicycles and bicycle spares have been taken up for the Government. Applica tions for vehicles and vehicle spares are accepted only on the recommendation of the Road Transport Administration. Section “O'—Miscellaneous All available applications were screened and passed. The Foreign Trade Con trol Division continues to receive applications for items which do not appear on the quota, such as cosmetics, toilet articles, stockings, haberdashery, et cetera. Un fortunately, we are unable to recommend imports of this nature against the miscel laneous tonnage allotted. The situation will be remedied to a certain extent by the new United States Parcel Post regulations which permit the shipment of 2 lb. pack ages of $25 value. The majority of the items in this Section are covered by applications, and the outstanding balance is more favorable than in the first half year. Pharmaceuticals A later date was fixed for the filling of applications, which are now being received. These will be screened in co-operation with the Imperial Iranian Pharma ceutical Institute after the closing date on 15 October 1944 (23 Mehr 1323). The outline of application procedure was published during September (10 Shahrivar—8 Mehr), and the new forms are now available for use.

Con- ^ tract trucks carried 11,^81 tons ot government goods. With respect to rail traffic we were able to take up only 67 per cent of the allocation of 1,000 tons for north bound traffic, with the result that goods again tended to accumulate in the Customs. There is a strong tendency on the part of merchants and forwarding agents to leave their goods in Customs due to falling prices and the availability of dates (fruit). The date traific is a profitable business early in the season, and in order to circumvent the inevitable congestion of the port under the present circumstances, the Road Transport Administration is work ing on the problem with the Customs Administration and the Iranian State Rail ways. The results, so far, are encouraging. With respect to rail transport from the north, the results for Shahrivar were far from satisfactory. We did not obtain the use of rail cars for grain and tobacco from Mianeh, that is 46 and 60 cars respectively; and the cars approved for grain at other points were not always placed at our disposal. Merchants applied for 1,018 cars, were granted i!4, and actually received 86 in the Tehran Division only. None were approved for the Sari Division, i. e. Bandar Shah-Shahi et cetera. Rent Control Little has been said in previous reports about the results of our activities in connection with the stabilization of rents. From the beginning, the Division of Rents has been under the direction of Dr. Afshar, who^e worl$ has been highly commen dable. The Division had received, up to the end of ShaHn'var, a total of 6,314 peti tions, of which 3,809 were from proprietor and 2,525 from tenants. The operations of this Division have brought protection and relief to many people and have con tributed to the general stabilization of economic conoitions An agreement has now been reached with the Ministry of Justice for the extension of rent control to various provincial cities. Industrial Supervision The Acting Director General of the Administration of Industrial Supervision participated in an inspection of the Shahi and Beshahr Weaving Plants, and the Shahi Gunny Factory. Various sound actions have been taken by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry with respect to these factories. While conditions at the Shahi Weaving Plant with regard to spare parts were critical, the principal difficulty resulted from a long continued period of mis-mana- gement and lack of discipline. This was evidenced by the fact that production dur ing the stay of the inspection commission rose fifteen hundred meters per day. As is true of virtually every national factory, the Shahi Weaving Plant is considerably •verstaffed.8 % t At the Shahi Gunny Factory, the manager was changed, with a resultant con siderable increase in efficiency of operation. Production of Hessian has been in creased from the previous 800 meters per day, to an average of 2,400 meters per day, production of Gunny bags is up from a previous average of 50 per day to a daily average of 7o0 per day. This increase has been effected through better dis cipline, better management, and the discharge of several employees. At the Beshahr Weaving Plant, conditions with regard to spares and labor were found to be better than at Shahi. The principal difficulty in the way of efficient production at Beshahr was the lack of sufficient power. Arrangements are presently undei way to semi engineers from the Tehran Municipal Power Plant to Beshahr to recondition the generating equipment. With competent management and repair to the generators, a production of fifty to sixty thousand meters per day should be i^reve'nV ° nS£qUent reduction in P er ' meter cost and a substantial increase Production of shoes at the Gas Mask Factory is up from a previous 300 pairs per day to shghtly more than 500 per day. Plans are now being completed to raise th.s figure to 750. Production of garments for the Army has been speeded up and increased work put into the plant in the form of an order for twenty-thousand complete uniforms for the Gendarmerie. iwemy inousand durinTthTS ™r he inCreaSe in Pr0dUC,f0n at thr - 0f the Plants Machine Guns, from 20 per day to 65 per day; * &lt;lfles ’ from 40 per day to 100 per day; Cartridges, from 15,000 per day to 50,000 per day.

Internal Revenue Tax receipts in lehranfcr the month under review amounted to ids. 39,053,918.10 compared with Rls. 33,111^43.25 during the corresponding period last year. This is an increase of k!s. 5,942,775.25, or 18 per cent. Increases were recorded in the three principal tax categories, income tax, petroleum products tax and excise on alcohol. When comparing collection figures with those of last year, consideration must be given the fact that several tax categories which produced considerable revenue last year were abolished as of 1 Farvardin 1323. These include the 3 per cent tax, 10 per cent tax on mine products, and 10 per cent tax on forest products. In addition, the electricity tax is now collected for the account of the municipalities. Receipts from these taxes in Shahrivar 1322 amounted to Rls. 3,222,627.'20. Receipts in lefnan for the first six months of the current fiscal year were Rls. 377,997,885.25 compared with Rls. 282,373,550.10 during the corresponding period of 1322, an increase of Rls. 95,6:4,335.15, or 33 per cent. Income tax revenues in creased from Rls. 172,533,945.25 to Rls, ^.43,663,438.35, or 4t per cent; petroleum products tax from Rls. 66,253,566.95 to Rls. 85,581,151.70, an increase of 30 per cent; and excise on alcohol from Rls. 17,511,679.35 to Rls. 33,533,684.35, or 94 per cent. At the end of the first six months of 1323 the amount of income tax collechd in Tehran was a little more than ninety per cent of the total amount collected during the entire fiscal year 1322. While the tax picture in Tehran is relatively bright, the same cannot be said of the provinces. Available statistics show that revenue from taxes had in the past been divided almost equally between the provinces and Tehran. Provincial receipts this year show a decrease of approximately 50 per cent in comparison with leceipts during the corresponding period last year, and constitute only about 21 per cent of collections for the entire country this year. The two main reasons for the poor showing in the provinces are: (1) the difficulties and delays which have been en countered in putting the income tax in operation and (2) the abolishment of the 3 per cent tax, mines and forest tax and transference of the electricity tax to the municipalities. These taxes last year accounted for 36 per cent of total provincial receipts. Most of the delays in connection with the income tax have been overcome; but it is not believed that that tax will provide sufficient additional revenue to make up for the loss caused by the annulment of the taxes mentioned above. The currentincome tax law exempts from taxation through increased deductions persons in the lower income brackets who formerly paid the tax. It also exempts government employ ees. These two classes in the past paid a considerable part of the total collections in the provinces. In addition, many localities have no industries. The tax on agricul tural income was expected to replace the 3 per cent tax. However, the procedure for collecting the tax on agricultural income requires extensive surveys; and this tax is not likely to produce much revenue for several months. Moreover, in several regions finance Agents report that it is impossible to make the surveys on account of disorder. Ahwaz and Kerman show an increase in income tax receipts for the first four months of the year; and it is expected that those districts where the income is predominantly from agricultural sources will make a better showing as the sur veys proceed and collections of the tax from agricultural incomes can be carried out. Up to the end of Shahrivar the tax programme for the municipalities was still under discussion, and no definite decision had been reached. The proposals made to the representatives of the Ministry of Interior provided for increased rates on some existing taxes, the transference of some of the Government taxes to the municipalities and the levying of certain new taxes. The proposal also provided for the elimination of the municipal tax on petroleum products and an equivalent increase in the Government tax on those products. Due to the failure of the income tax in the provinces to produce sufficient revenue so that the municipalities’ ten P&lt;t cent of that tax would compensate for the loss of revenue through the annul ment of the weighing tax, many municipalities were in financial difficulties. It is hoped that before the end of Mehr a solution of the problem can be reached. Receipts from indirect taxes in the Tehran district amounted to RIs. 19,380,996.95 during the month under review, compared with Rls. 17,287,340.60 during the corresponding month last year, an increase of Rls. 2,093,656.35, or 12 percent. In creases were recorded for the tax on petroleum products, excise on alchool and carriage tax. In addition to the abolished taxes, which naturally brought in no revenue, there was a decrease in receipts from the slaughter tax, bicycle tax, auc tion tax and miscellaneous revenues. .o, 7 » C ^on fr0mdir2C ,' ‘Tn, in Tellran during Shahrivar amounted to Rls. 19,178,346.90 compared w.th Rls, 15,391,854.66 during the same period last year ^ 8 ^°r 24 percent, tncome tax accoumed for Rls. 18,809,464.10 of the amount collected.

Government Supplies Under the direction of Mr. Berriman, assisted by Mr. Booin, considerable im provement has been shown in the operations of the State General Supply Corpora tion. The new administration is emphasizing results, rather than method. The aim is to speed up action and also tighten controls. The change in the directing person nel was made late in Shahrivar, and the reporting of operations will be deferred until next month. inspections Steps have been taken to build up a more adequate and efficient inspection force in the Administration of General Inspection and also to organize the work of supervising the provincial administrations, with particular reference to the ap pointment of high-grade personnel for provincial positions. inspections are proceeding in Guilan, Arak, Meshed, Kermanshah, and Kordes- tan; and investigations are under way in connection with opium distribution and stocks of Government goods and furniture. Personnel Action was taken during Shahrivar to speed up the payment of salaries in the provinces and to correct various conditions that have produced delays or inequities in the situation of employees. The issuance of a Regulation by the Ministry fixing the salaries of the Iranian Assistants of American officials has made it necessary to consider the appointment •f suitable Iranian officials to these posts. The representatives of the shareholders of the Mortgage Bank at a General Meet ing confirmed my appointment of Mr. Abbass Gholi Ardalan as a member of the Board of Directors to succeed Mr. Jemal Emami Khoi. Mr. Ferguson has been ap-14 pointed a Deputy Administrator General of the Finances, and Mr. Dozier has become Acting Chief Administrator of the Distribution Section. Mr. Nezammudm Emami has been appointed Chief of the Iranian Economic Mission in India, and Mr. Sartipi will goas Mr. Emami’s assistant. Following the resignation of Mr. Hansen, Mr. Berriman has been appointed Acting Director of the State General Supply Corpora tion. Mr. Agh-Evli has been named Acting Provincial Director of Azerbaijan, taking the place of Mr. Majid-Zadeh, who has been transferred to Tehran. In closing, permit me to thank Your Excellency for your able help and coidial cooperation and to assure you of our high regard and distinguished consideration. A. C.

Until delays that we encounter in the printing of the monthly report can be eliminated, it will be necessary for me to omit much information, particularly that of a detailed nature. Such information will be submitted to Your Excellency separate ly, and, to the greatest extent possible, will be given to the press for publication. Cereals, Bread, And Tea The supply of grain is sufficient to meet the food requirements of the country. Unfortunately, interested individuals and groups continue their efforts to restrict and weaken the grain-collection program. In any event, our success in providing food for the people depends upon the complete carrying out of the collection and transportation program in the North, particularly in Azerbaidjan. The quantities represented by landlords’ engagements taken and grain collected ia less at this time than on the same date last year, due to the partial or total crop failures in the South where the harvest comes first. When collection activities are under way in the areas where crops are better, it will be possible to present a fair comparison. The total Tehran Silo stocks at the end of Mordad amounted |° 2 ’ 6/ tons, while the total provincial stocks on the same date amounted to 71 ; 017 tons The total for Tehran and the provinces was 99,693 tons, compared with 29,^80 ton* on the same date last year.In new regulations, we have freed both the sale and transport of domesticf ^ while giving an opportunity to the growers to sell their tea to the Government, certain conditions. The question of rice purchases has been under consideration and negotiatio Commodity Supply Section, a ficials anc Inflation in Iran is due in part to the scarcity of goods. In cases where tk M r&gt; Wien supply of imported goods is insufficient to meet the needs of 'ran, we havef'™ and every effort to obtain an increase in the quotas and allocations fixed by the Mido Directors East Supply Centre (Cairo). other offi Much has been said about unfilled quotas in 1943, the fact is, of course, tk operated the organization under my control had little opportunity in that year to do anythin shall nan about quotas or about the issuance of import permits and transport licenses, ani services, consequently, we cannot take responsibility for what happened or failed to happe It go Nevertheless, imports and exports in 1322 were both substantially larger than tribes ha 132 1 .

The recommendations of the Coveinment and my own we: anc ^ ,s P1 promptly transmitted to the Middle East Supply Centre. NaU It is my hope that at the end of 1323 we shall have received a sufficient supp of essential goo Is and that the foreign trade of the country will show another sut stantial augmentation. ^ ie It will be understood that many quotas are partly or wholly allotted to th A conce merchants; and these cannot be filled unless the merchants submit tneir applies can &lt; ^ li( tions on time. means, s In general, it is our policy, as repeatedly stated, to return both foreign aiK M j ss j on domestic trade to normal commercial channels as soon and as completely a&gt; po; ,. sible. Progress has already been made in the carrying out of this policy, althougt necessarily, the restoration of normal commercial conditions in Iran depends « large part on the international situation.

For some months past he cities, but also, in increas are happy to know that thi Government and the Majless now recognize that our efforts in th''s connection have borne fruit. It is appropriate at this time to express our appreciation to th^se who have contribu- ted to this fortunate outcome: Mr. Ferguson, Chief Administrator of the Pistribution Section, and Mr. Dozier, Administrator of the Rationing Division; their Iranian of ficials and employees; Mr. Gordon, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Murray, Mr. Solomon, and Mr. Wiens, American Provincial Director-Generals of Finance; the Iranian officials and ^iployees under them who have assisted in this work; the Iranian Finance Directors and financial agents in independent financial agencies; and Mr Shields and other officials and employees of the Koad T.ansport Administration who have co operated with respect to the transportation of monopoly goods. In later reports I shall name the Iranian officials and employees who have rendered outstanding services. ’ It goes without saying that much still remains to be done. Many villages and tribes have not yet been served; and in certain areas, to which American officials have not been permitted to proceed, administrative conditions are comparatively unsatisfactory. Though measurably checked, or reduced, irregularities still exist. Your Excellency may be assured that we shall continue to ben 1 all of our energies to the perfecting and completing of this task, so long as it remains a Government activity and is entrusted to us. Naturally, we shall be able to continue distribution only if and when we have the goods to distrioute. .Vith respect to cotton piece-goods, the dis'ribution program will be disrupted or delayed if any d day should occur in procurement and shipment. The situation in Tehran with regard to rationing has caused us serious concern. A concerted attempt has been made to discredit and, if possible, remove the Ameri can Chief Administrator of Distribution, and, in this way and by other disgraceful means, self-interested persons and intriguers have tried and are still trvmg to step the distribution of the new ration books, cripple our work, and hurt the American Mission. We hepe in the future to have the cooperation of the Government and particularly of Justice and the Police in the carrying out of our program, which »s vital to the public welfare and to the prevention of dishonest practices. Factories The Administration of Industrial Supervision is endeavoring to increase the do mestic output of textiles, and, to this end, attempted during the month under repoi t to effect the movement of raw cotton. Some success was achieved, although this work has been delayed, apparently through inaction in the Cotton Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. Production of munitions shows satisfactory improvement. As a result of cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of-4- Commerce, an Industrial Management Coiporation has been established by decrn of the Council of Ministers for the purpose of administering certain factories. Road Transport I he Road Transport Administration reports no change with respect to main. tenance. On 28 Mordad 1323, the assignments of Government-owned trucks were as fo lows: to the Cereals and Bread flection, 520; Ministry of Agricult#t H Ministry of Commerce and Industries, 40; other Departments 25; under Tehr,« control and under repair, 469; a total of 1.063. During Mordad, the Administration moved by contracted lorries a total of 5,826,152 kilos of Government goods. The quantity moved by Government trucks is not reported.

Tobacco Distribution : or about a year we have been receiving complaints from all parts of the ^country wi‘h respect to the distribution of tobacco products. The Administration of e Tobacco and ^pium Monopolies has been instructed to distribute these pro ducts directly to the provin cial centers, where they will be sold by local companies. Steps have been taken to increase the production of tobacco; and these measures, along with others, are expected to bring improvement in this situation. Internal Revenue Income tax receipts were approximately the same in Mordad as in the corres ponding month of lo22. Certain defects in the Income Tax Law have caused delays in the filing of declarations. Moreover, serious delay occurred in putting the Law into effect due to the fact that for some time we had no approved regulations. When action by the Financial Laws Committee of the Majless permuted us to take all necessary steps, a further delay occurred due to the failure of the postal service to make prompt delivery of income tax forms. Our reports indicate that collections are now proceeding and that receipts may be equal to our estimates. The annulment of the three per cent tax has particularly affected revenue col lection in the provinces, where in many localities it accounted for as much as 70 per cent of total receipts. In order to overcome the deficit caused by the elimina tion of this source of revenue, we proposed some time ago projects of law for in creasing the slaughter-house taxes and the stamp duties. Neither has yet been enact- led into law. Treasury Operations Receipts of the Treasury General on account of ordinary revenues during the first four months of 1323 were 863,881,000 rials, compared with 1,042,838,000 rials during the corresponding period of last year. Receipts on account of commercial revenues tor the same penod were 1,514,709,000 rials in 1323 and 952,276,000 in 1322. Total receipts amounted to 2,378,590,000 in 1323 and 1,995,114,000 in 1322, an increase of 383,476,000 during the first four months of the present ye^r. During this four months period, ordinary expenditures were 915,749,000 rials in 1323, compared with 970,439,000 rials in 1322, while commercial expenditures were 1,632,541,000 rials in 1323 and 1,258,766,000 in 1322. Total expenditures amounted to 2,548,290,000 rials at the end ot Tir 1323, while they amounted toi i ■ - 6 - 2,229,205,000 on the same date in 1322, The deficit was 169,700,000 rials on that date this year, compared with a deficit of 234,091,000 rials a year ago.

Personnel Within the Administration of Personnel, important changes were made in the high officials of both the Personnel Department and the Pension Department, reorganization made progress, studies proceeded on a variety of problems, action was taken to expedite the handling of employees’ contracts, and a draft of a Manual of Instructions was completed. Our chief problem, as Your Excellency knows, is the problem of compensation. Until this problem has been finally solved, the current reduction in the cost of living will afford considerable relief. Following the departure of Mr. Gresham on leave, Mr. Zellie, formerly Director- General of the Administration of Inspection, was appointed Director-General of Customs. Mr. Vivian was appointed Director-General of Inspection, and, during Mr. Vivian’s absence on leave, Mr. Nyman is serving as Acting Director-Ueneral. Because of Mr. Vivian’s transfer from the Administration of Industrial Supervision, Mr. Har ris has been appointed Acting Director-General of that Administ.ation. Dr. Lewis has arrived from the United States and has been appointed Associate to the Ad ministrator General of the Finances for Special Economic and Financial Affairs. New arrivals include Mr. Torbert, assigned to the Section of Distrioution, and Mr. Bodin, now serving as Assistant to the Director of the State General Supply Corporation.

Those who are concerned with the welfare of this country will feel gratified and reassured by the information relating to economic activities herewith presented. Because of the slowness of mail and telegraphic services, the complexity of our operations, and other conditions, the organization of a nation-wide reporting sys tem has been extremely difficult and slow. Because of the inadequacy of public in formation, many well-intentioned persons gained the impression a few weeks ago that no results were being achieved. Results were, of course, being achieved even then; and progress has since been made at an accelerating pace. The reports that are made to us are not yet complete; but additional information will be presented in my next report. Monopoly Goods At the beginning of Tir stocks of sugar in the country totalled 26,102 tons, and shipments amounting to 7,319 tons were received during the month. Orders issued for delivery to distribution points amounted to 4,082 tons Because of lack of complete reports from the provinces, it is impossible to report the stocks at the end of the month. Foreign tea stocks at the beginning of the month are reported as 1,996 tons. We received during the month 1,394 tons, and delivery orders were issued for 514 tons. Doraistic tea stocks were 2,534 tons. We received during the month -io4 tons and shipped 250 tons to the provinces.f 2 Piece-goods on hand at the beginning of lit amounted to about 24,000 bales. During the month, delivery orders were issued for 16,554 bales. Actual distribution of monopoly goods during the month was on a much wid&lt;~ scale than at any time in the past. While we do not have complete mformabon from the provinces, we shall briefly review reports from each Ostan. First Ostan. In the Arak area the following villages weie supplied with mono poly goods: Farahan, Najafabad, Korzeh, Ill-Zand; and in Saveh about 70 vdlages have received their ration with material available to take care of the remaming vil lages. In Shahsevar, distribution was proceeding satisfactorily. A representative of the Distribution Section was present at Ouilan, where the distribution of monopoly goods is favorably reported. In the Kazvin area distribution for Tir was completed for sugar and tea in all the villages and towns except four, where distribution was still in process. The distribution of piece-goods was begun in this area during Tir. Second Cstan. tull quantities of monopoly goods to meet rationing require ments for towns and villages were shipped from warehouses, and distribution was either completed or under way for the full area. Particular attention is called t© Gorgan where a representative of the Distribution Section has been stationed to help the Finance Agent in view of the conditions resulting from the earthquakes. Reports have been received that durng Tir 75,25z kilos of sugar, 875 kilos of tea, and 212 bales of piece-goods were distributed among the people. 3rd and 4th Ostaas. Distribution was under way in many towns and villages including Mianeh, Marand, Jolla, Arasparan, Shabestar, and Azar Shahr. A repre sentative of the Distribution Section has been stationed at Tabriz for some time owing to the special difficulties encountered in this area in moving up stocks from Mianeh and other points It is believed that substantial progress has been made in overcoming transportation difficulties in this area. Every effort possible is being made by the Section of Distribution to eliminate difficulties affecting distribution of monopoly goods there. Close co-operation is being received from all officials con cerned. 5th Ostan. The Director General of Finance reports the distribution of mono poly goods to 260 trioal divisions and villages in Kermanshah and Kordestan. All reports tromthis area indicate a quite satisfactory condition; and the officials concern ed are to be commended for their efforts. 6th Ostan. Monpoly goods have been distributed over a wide area including Baneh, Boyeh, Ahmadi, Sardsiri, Garmsiri and Bavi. A representative of the Section ofDistribution has been assigned to this Ostan to assist in the distribution of sugar, tea and piece-goods and also to aid in the distributionof ration books. Other places jjJiere distribution has been completed during the month of Tir or was in progress N.ere: Abadan, Khorramshahr, Aligudarz, Dorud, Borudjerd, and Khorramabad. 7th Ostan. Sug. r and tea have been distributed in Lar, Fassa, Darab, Jahrom, Est*hbanat, Neiriz, Firuzabad, Kazeroon. Piece-goods have been distributed in the city of Shiraz, with plans projected for widespread distribution to tribes and villages. In the Bushire area distribution of sugar and tea has been effected in Dashti, Nekest- an, Ahrom, Itikali, Jakootah, Bezarjan. 9th Ostan. Reports indicate that all monopoly goods ordered for this area have been received, it is further reported that sugar and tea have been distributed in all of the provinces and that piece-goods distribution was in full operation for many places, including Meshed itself. Responsible officials have demonstrated a very good preparation and administration in meeting the distribution problems of this area. 10th Ostan. Improvement has been shown over -he previous good periormance in this area, with even more satisfactory results expected in following months. Re gular distribution has been accomplished in such places as Golpayegan, Ardestan, Arabestan, Najafabad, Karvan, Faredan, Shahreza, Sedeh, and Marban, as well as in Isfahan itself. Substantial improvement in distribution in Yezd and surrounding ter ritory is reported. The following excerpts from a report submitted by the Director-General of Finance show both methods used and progress made. “When at Nowroozwe began the serious work of reorganizing our distribution department, we were faced by several big problems. We were required t-:* distribute to almost one and a half million people, mostly in small villages- We were getting the bare outlines of an organization. Competent, honest personnel was extremely hard to find and train. Moreover, we discovered that any system of distribution which was not carefully supervised was bound to give rise to enormous abuses. As a result of considerable trial and error, we finally evolved a quarterly rather than c monthly system of distribution. “Under our system each person receives his ration only once a quarter, but at that time receives his entire three months’ ration. This system has gone in;o full applica tion during the second quarter of this year beginning with Tir. Each quarter our distribution department will begin at. one end of the province and by the end of the quarter will have supervised the distribution to every person in the province, asprovided in Circular No. 8685. The efficiency and economy, as well as increased control, are obvious. “By the end of this quarter, that is, by the end of Shahrivar, we hope to hav^ completed the rationing of the entire province, including Chaharmahal anu Fereidan “Our commissions are now either registering or have completed the registrati n of every province except Fereidan to which a comnvssion will be sent shortly “In Chaharmahal and Fereidan, uuring the first quarter, 66,000 persons received three months rations, that is, 79,200 Kilos of sugar, and 9,900 kilos of tea Since the census in those areas had not been completed we could not distribute to the rest “On 26 lir our first regular rationing commission went to Chaharmahal, and we are hearing good reports about them. Within two weeks, two more commissions will go out, one to Fereidan and one mure to Chaharmahal. The work is therefore proceeding at full pace, as these are our last two districts. “Registration of the Bakhtiari tribe has been going on for some time under the direction of Morteza Ohouli Khan and various chieftans. For several months, we urged them in this matter, as we were eager to get out the goodo. As soon as the lists can be checked, the g^ods will be distributed under our supervision and in cooperation with the Bakhtiari leaders. “The work is going along rapidly and efficiently. 1 have personally gone to areas after the commissions finished their work, asking of peasants whether they had re ceived their rationSy and all seemed happy.” It is further reported that through the cooperation of Iranian State Railway and Ministry officials connected with the railway, monopoly goods have been distributed to railway employees and their families at all towns and villages a'ong the entire railway system, this has proved a special help in some of the smaller places not in close proximity to major distribution centers. In the city of Tehran, the first distribution of piece-goods to the population within a year was about completed at the end of Tir. Sugar and tea rations were made available to the public, as usual. «• This summary will serve to indicate a continuing upward trend toward a more satisfactoiy performance. Since the first of the year, each succeeding month has shown a substantial improvement over the previous month. There is every reason to believe that the following months will show similar results. An effective distribution organiza-tion under the direction of Mr. Ferguson has been created, and a sound distribution policy established. Should there be no serious interrupliun, the accomplishments during the first half of the current year should be well exceeded in the later half of the year. Success in the distribution of monopoly goods depends on transportation. The goods must be moved from die customs, from the factories, and from the central warehouses to the various distribution points and from there to different points within the several provinces Therefore, a statement of goods actually moved pro vides a fairly good indication of distribution activities, unfortunately, the Road Trans port Administration is not yet aole to report all movements of goods. The following table, however, shows governmeiit good^ transported by contrac ted lorries during the month of Tir.

This rate of rebuilding lorries suitable for service will be increased ^ as time goes on, but substantial results in rehabilitation cannot be expected until th« machine shop equipment on order has airived and has been placed in use. A program of unit rep’acements (replacing motors that need overhaul with reconditioned or new motors) has been placed in opeiation and is underway at Isfahan and Kermaa. The piogram will be extended to include Meshed, Reshi, Tabriz and Hamadan, as rapidly as possible. The advantage of unit replacements is that lorries need not be brought to Tehran for motor overhaul. At the end of Tir, 314 of the original 90 1 Dodge lorries were in Tehran and out of sevice because of mechanical condition. Of these many will have to be scrapped. It is estimated that an additional 75 Dodge lorries in the provinces are out of service because of mechanical condition, and some of these will likewise go into salvage. Of new I. G. Ford lorries thai are being delivered to the Road Transport Adminis tration through Lend-Lease channels, 52 have been reserviced and placed in operation The maintenance of Government automobiles has also progressed to a point where results can be observed. The Office of Transport Priorities ha^ been tranfened to the Road Transport Administration. The manner and method of handling and deter mining transport priorities will not be changed, except that they will be handled exclusively by the Transport Priorities group under the Department cf Operations of the Division of Transportation of the Road Trinsport Aoministration. Cereals and Bread It is customary to consider the month of Tir as closing a crop year. Therefore, the following statistics may be considered ac representing the final record of the past year’s operations. Although later information may change slightly the figures given herein, such changes will not be significant, and it is not intended to publish further statistics of last year’s operations. Collection and Stock Situation Total stipulations received through the month of Tir Receipts from the stipulations as per statistics received, for the 1st and 15th of Tir Last year the corresponding figures were: Total stipulations to the 15th of Tir, 1322 Total receipts to the 15th of Tir 1322 336,700 Reports mostly 366,153 158,924 146,095 tons12 Tehran Silo Stocks—31st of fir 1323 Wheat Barley Ordinary flour Barley flour 000 flour Millet Corn Millet flour Sankinak Total 6,711 tons 15,964 V 2,985 V 1,197 »&gt; 2,476 » 1,932 ,» 272 27 11 2 11 31,566 tons Provincial Kharbar Stocks on the 20th of Tir, 1323 Wheat Barley Grand Total Tehran and Provincial Stocks 3S,438 tons 33,646 „ Total 72,08* tons 103,650 tons Last year the combined stocks for iehran and in the provinces as of the ^Oth ©f Tir, 1322, was 21,713 tons. During the month of Tir the Cereals and Bread Section, directed by Dr. Black, assumed responsibility for adminislration of the domestic tea monopoly and certain ©ther activities that have formerly been the responsibility of the Price Stabilization Section. Th* transportation of the gram from Azerbaijan to Tehran has b°en handicap ped by bad roads and by a shortage of transportation equipment. Substantial stocks of grain have been held at outlying point* in Azerbaijan because it was impossible to move grain over existing roads. Arrangements were completed with the co-opera- ion of the Ministry of Roads and with the Road Transport Administration whereby funds were made available for the emergency repair of ''ertain key roads in Azer baijan. It is expected that these emergency repairs will be completed quickly and their completion will permit the transfer of grain to Tehran. Negotiations were also completed with Iransovtrans whereby additional grain may be transported over the main roads to the rail head in the North. A Commission of the Majless was formed during the month of Tir and exten-r is 13 sive discussions were held in respect to certain parts of the current year’s Cereals and Bread Regulations. The Commission desired that modification of the regulations ^sbe made with respect to the following points: 1. That the Government refrain from collecting any surplus grain directly from peasants; 2. That the exemptions from collection from petty landlords be increased irom 1/2 ton to 1 ton; 3. That the price to be paid for grain should be the same everywhere and that no deduction should be made because of the difference in distances to the grain depots because of the difference in transportation costs; 4. 'lhat there should be no penalty charged against the grain containing more than 5 percent impurities; 5. That the price of grain in the country should be the same as last year’s; 6. That transport of grain to towns should be permitted freely. After comprehensive discussions it was decided to exempt entirely the peasants surplus from collection by the Government, and a regulation to that effect was is sued. This action was taken upon the insistence of the members of the Majless and it may result in reducing collections to a point where the bread supply of the nabon may be endangered. Should there be shortages in the supply of tread in the towns later in the year, the responsibility for this situation has been assumed by the Maj less and is not the responsibility of myself or of the Cereals and Bread Section. With regard to the recommendation for an increase of exemptions to the petty landlords it is believed that the exemption of the peasants’ share has so handicapped our collection program that further modifications which will result in lower collection cannot be approved. A substantial concession has already been made to the petty landlords under Cereals and Bread Regulation No. 149/9 which increased the exemp tions to 1/2 ton. Even this concession has brought protests from our officials in the provinces who have reported its adverse effect upon collection. 3. Referring to point 3 above, with regard to transport cost, the practice this year is the same as last year. It is a universal commercial practice that producers haul their product to markets and that the more distant producers pay higher trans port costs. This difference in costs is taken into consideration by owners when they buy or sell properties, and no hardship is involved in the continuance of a sy&gt;tem that has always been ar. accepted commercial practice. 4. Referring to point 4, it is considered that a--percent tolerance without penalty is a reasonable standard for impurities. The double deduction above 5 percent is to’ ’■* 14 encourage delivery of clean grain and to save la^gesums of money that would other wise be spent for transporting dirt. Last year in some places grain was delivered containing zO percent impurities. It is probable that for the country as a whole over' 30,000 tons of impurities were transported. This, aside from the waste of public money, is undesirable when we consider the shortage of transport. It would be, of course, ideal to have the grain cleaned and to pay for the actual quantity of clean grain. This is not practicable, however, because cleaning machinery is not available. 5. Referring to point 5, it is impossible to raise the price of grain to the level of last year’s price unless the Govern.r.ent is prepared to (a) lose the same large amount as last year on its grain operation and bread subsidy, or (b) to accept a general raise in the price of bread to consumers. Neither of these alternatives is to be recommended in view of continuing budget deficits and in view of the insistent demands for a decline rather than an increase in the cost of living. 6. Referring to point 6, it has been necessary heretofore to restrict the movement of grain into the cities so as to insure the success of the Government’s collection program. It is possible,however, that ceitain modifications in this program might be made should other means be adopted which would guarantee that the Government could collect sufficient grain for the needs of the country. This matter is still under consideration and should be discussed further. We informed the Majless Commission that, beiore any modifications along this line could be made, an enforcement law should be passed to insure the full collec tion of grain from the landlords. Total expenditures of the Cereals and Bread Section during the month of Tir are as follows: Administrative expenses of the Cereals and Bread Section including the Rice Division Sent to Provinces for grain purchase RIs. 12,468,68680 „ 19,485,396.00 „ 24,546,726.60Treasury Operations The following table, which, along with others, is submitted by Mr. Le Count, ^Treasurer-General, shows receipts by the Treasury-General from ordinary revenues for the twelve months of 1322 and thj first three months of 132j.

This may be considered a satisfactory showing, in view of the elimination this year of the 3 percent tax and the delay in the execution of the new income iax. Disbursements in the ordinary account by the Treasury-General are shown similarly below. See 2T27fThe table below summarizes the data given in the preceding tables.

The increase is due, as shown above, to the heavy disbursements in the commercial account. Because of the irregular nature of commercial disbursements, too much signi ficance should not be attached to the figures for the first three months of the year. It is evident, however, that the linancing of the varied operations of the Iran ian Government still presents extreme difficulty; and, in view of the increase al ready provided for in the proposed budget for 1323, it will not be possible to incur any further additional obligations.♦ 19 The internal debt at the end of Tir was as follows: Current Items Overdraft in State Revenue Account at Bank Melli Iran Other i-oans at Bank Melli Iran Treasury Bonds Other Items at Treasury General Total Current 1.884,045,948.45 Deferred and Fast Due items Rls. 341,695,213.75 1,111,922,897 95 162,271,000.00 268,156,836.75 Overdraft in Economic Liquidation Account at Bank Melli Iran Other Loans at Bank Melli Iran Miscellaneous Claims by Agricultural Bank Debt to Bank Melli Iran Issue Department Total Deferred and Past Due Total Internal Indebtedness 295,326,666.55 1,161,949,495.45 57,619,089.65 1,400 000,000.0Q_ 2,914,895,251.65 4,798,941,200.10 In addition to the above indebtedness, Rls. 988 million has been put at the disposal of Ministries and Administrations and was unused at the end of the month. The only new borrowing from the Bank Melli Iran during the month was the Loan for Rls. 36 million account loans to the various municipalities. As those loans had already been advanced from the State Revenue Account, the borrowing from the Bank was used to reimburse the latter account, and hence created no new indebtedness.

Some oi the matters that are omitted from this report are probably of greater long-range importance than those that have been discussed at length. Examples of such noteworthy matters are the following: the practi cal completion of work on the 1323 Budget; advancement of organization for the administration of the new Inct me lax Law; submission to the Government of a project, prepared by Mr. Em?mi. Director General of Ceded Properties, f ublic Domains and Exploitation, for the sale of Goverr.mtm estates to peasants, tribes men, and others; further revision and study of the project tor a Civil Service Law; submission to the Ministry of Finance ot a Regulation for the appointment and fix ing of salaries of Iranian Assistants to American officials; study and revision of the Rent Regulations; improvement of inspections; settlement, in cooperation with the Ministry of War, of various questions relating to the munitions factories, study of other factory operations; and changes in Customs procedures to expedite handling of monopoly and i_end Lease goods and to facilitate Middle East Supply Centre operations, Personnel In view of the progress that has been made in the work of the Ministry of Fi nance and its connected organizations, the Iranian and American officials and em ployees who have contributed to these results deserve the highest commendation. We have been happy to observe in the last few weeks among our Iranian collabo rators many instances of meritorious performance. I desire to single out for jpecial citation the case of Mr. Ismail Katouzian, Ministerial Inspector, who, with energy and persistence and possibly at some risk to his life, uncovered a series of illegal acts and prepared evidence for the apprehension and prosecution of a number of high ranking officials. Recent personal changes which should be noted include the arrival of Mr. Berri- man and his appointment as Director-General of Finance of Ostans 3 and 4, the appointment of Mr. Luckett as Provincial Finance Director of the Center; the arri-Permit me to close this report with tue assurances of my high consideration.

In order to present the latest information and in accordance with my usual practice, I shall mention developments that have occurred up to the date of writing (16 Tir 1323-7 July 1944) Emergency Activities Something over a year ago (13 Ordibehesht 1 322), the Majless enacted what was commonly known as the 'Full-Powers' Law, for the purpose of checking the rapid rise in prices that had been going on for,about two years. Under this law, the Administrator General of the Finances and hi* staff be came an emergency and temporary instrument of the Majless for the accom plishment of the purpose of the law. During tht war emergency, much authority over the economic life of Iran had been and still is necessarily exercised by international agencies, ei ther in or out of this country. The same situation exists in other countries, large and small. In time of war, nations must act together cooperatively; and no single nation can proceed on its way with complete liberty of action. Th« international agencies that exercise emergency authority obviously cannot be made responsible to the law-making bodies of the variou* cooperating na tion* This abnormal situation is incidental to a state of war and need have n© real or permanent effect on the sovereignty or constitutional processes of the nations concerned. It is not commonly realized in Iran how much power over the econo mic life of the country has been exercised by agencies representing the Al- | lies. Their activities have had marked effects on foreign trade, foreign exchange, j the supply of goods, purchasing power, domestic production, internal ' transportation, and various phases of internal administration. These activities have been carried on. I am sure,with full and sympathetic attention to the needs ofIran; and. on many occaiions and in important ways, the Allies heve helped Iran to solve the domestic problems that have been created by tha emergency. Under the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 1322. a temporary emergency organ ization was created within the Iranian Government under my general direc tion. One of the happy results of the Law, not commonly appreciated, has been to take back into the structure and supervision of the Iranian Govern ment some of the agencies and much of the responsibility and initialise for merly possessed by foreign authorities. This development, which has been fully endorsed and aided by the Allies, has been greatly to tht interest of Iran. In other words, it is, I am told, the policy of the Allies to leave to the Iranian Government and its administrative organization as much as pos sible of the responsibility pertaining to the economic life of the country. The Law of 13 Ordibehesht 1322 facilitated the carrying out of this policy and thus facilitated the eventual— and, let us hope, the early—transition from an emergency situation to the completely normal processes of government. In my opinion, taking in view the critical situation of Iran, the Law of 13 O/dibe- hesht 132 2 offered the safest and surest way to preserve during the emer gency, and, resto're in full vigor at its end the rightly prized principle of parliamentary responsibility. Prices History amply demonstrates that uncontrolled inflation is a grave menace to parliamentary constitutional government. The economic, distress and dislocations resulting from inflation invite revolution; and the course of re- volution, while unpredictable, is quite likely to lead to the destruction of free governmet t. it is fortunate, therefore, for the constitutional future of Iran, thai partly as a result of the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 1322, prices in Iran shoul have been measurably stabilized. From Farvardin 1321 to Farvardin 1322 the general price-index rose about 180 per cent. From Farvardin 132 2 t&lt; Farvardin 1323, the rise was about 17 per cent. It is true that many factor contributed to this result. Certainly, a major factor has been the approachini end of the war. and, for this factor, we must thank the valorous might oi ‘ s 0 wellas the vas ' and power of the British Em pirc and the United States.Economic Policies When the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 1322 was passed, the policy was to stab lize prices, rents and wages. Daring the first twelve months after the Law was passed, we felt it necessary to agree to various increases in prices, salaries and wages. At the present time, generally speaking and except for minor adjustments, the prices, salaries and wages that are under our control are being held at a level. In the case of certain commodities, the prices of which are fixed by us, extreme pressure is brought to bear upon us to approve increases. Such in creases must, of course, by paid by the Iranian people. They pay the bill, either in the form of higher prices to the consumer or in higher taxes to cover the Government deficit. Moreover, any increase in prices to the pro ducers of any particular commodity, such as grain, rice, tea, cotton, or to bacco, starts once again the vicious inflationary spiral. Consequently, we pro pose, except in special cases, where small adjustments are proved to be neces sary, to withhold our approval of any further elevation of prices. The fixing of prices of monopoly and controlled commodities has been assigned to a committee which carefully studies the pertinent facts and gives a hearing to the interested groups. It is, of course, understood that we have deliberatfly refrained from any attempt to fix prices generally or to control retail trade g°nerally. We felt that any such attempt was bound to fail, as it had failed prior to the enact ment of the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 1322. Results demonstrate the soundness of the policy. Our policy from the beginning has had special reference to the staple commodities — cereals, sugar, tea, and cotton piece - goods. These were already monopolized by the Government and it was necessary to maintain strict control over their procurement, rationing, and distribution. A few other commodities have been taken under control, notably automotive vehicles, parts, accessories, and tires. In some cases, for example with respect to fuels, we have relinquished controls and it is our policy to free other goods from control as soon as it become* possible to do so. It is also our general policy to leave as much business as possible in thehands of private Iranian merchants. The merchants understand} I am sure, the difficulties that beset us in executing on the one hand a policy of ration ing} fixed prices, and controlled distribution, and on the other a policy of encouraging private enterprise. We hope for the cooperation of the merchants in resolving these difficulties. i The policies that have been formulated by the Government or proposed by us to the Government go beyond the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 132 2 and also look far ahead of the present emergency. We face the prospect in the near future of falling prices. Furthermore, at the end of the war, the Government will be confronted with difficulties arising from labor dislocations, unemployment, property transfers, and the settlement of claims. In addition, the Government will have to take action with respect to currency stabilization, foreign exchange, and the protection and promotion of its foreign trade. Finally, the question of the Government budget will take on a new phase, calling for careful and prompt attention. With respect to these transitional and post-war problems, proposals have been made to the Government and action is being taken. A new project has been prepared by the Director-General of Ceded Properties, Public Domains and Exploitation for the sale of the public domains It is expected that this project, if approved by the Majless, will contribute both to agricultural development and to the betterment of the condition of the tribes. Economic Organization For various reasons, the organization established under the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 1322 has been changed from time to time. We have now abol ished the Price-Stabilization Section. With minor exceptions, responsibility for all activities in connection with cereals, bread, and certain farm products are now centered in the Cereals and Bread Section! responsibility for all activities in connection with tea, sugar and piece-goods is located in the Distribution Section; and responsibility for all transport activities and for supplies of auto motive vehicles, parts, accessories and tires is assigned to the Road Transport Administration. Similarly, the State General Supply Corporation is responsible for Government supplies and the Pharmaceutical Institute for drugsThe Foreign Trade Control Division* now directly responsible to me. will continue to exercise a general coordination of requirements and to issue transport licenses and import permits. The Rents Division is also made directly responsible to me. It is expected that this new set-up, by concentrating and fixing respon sibility, will eliminate jurisdictional conflicts and speed up operations. With respect to the overall supervision* of economic activities, especially those relating to the supplies of essential commodities, a proposal has been made to the Government for the establishment of a Central Committee, in which the Iranian Government will be represented by a responsible minister or ministers. Action was also taken more than a month ago to centralize and accel erate the preparation of information for the Minister of Finance, the Govern ment, the deputies of the Majless, and the press, so that the responsible au thorities maybe kept currently fully inforiued of the situation. Distribution of Monopoly Geode During the first three months of 132 3 substantial progress has been made in the distribution of sugar, tea and cotton piece-goods, both in Tehran and in the provinces. For example, during Farvardin, 818 bales of piece-goods were shipped from Tehran to the provinces; during Ordibehesht, 1,562 bales; and during Khordad, 4,519 bales. In Tehran, attheend of Khordad, approx imately 625,000 persons had received their piece-goods rations. It is expected at the end of Tir that distribution of piece-goods in Tehran will have been completed for the first quarter Reports from Meshed, Shiraz, Isfahan, Ahwaz and Kermanshah indicate that the distribution of monopoly gouds is pro ceeding more extensively, not only in the towns, but also in the villages and among the tribesmen. Complaints of non-distribution have markedly de creased; and, instead, we are receiving from all sections reports of actual distri bution to the people. I expect in my next report to present fuller and more detailed informa tion. Up to this time, the efforts of the Distribution Section have been con centrated on getting the goods out to the distribution centers. From now on,more attention will be paid to accounting and reporting: and the Provincial Directors and Financial Agents will beheld strictly responsible for prompt and accurate reporting of their operations Cerals and Bread The generally favorable prospects for an adequate bread supply tor Iran continue. Harvest is completed in the Southern Provinces and is preced ing in the Central regions. In the Western and Northern areas it is just beginning! but the crop is sufficiently matured everywhere to give assurance of a total yield adequate for the needs of the nation. In a few areas late season developments resulted in yield somewhat smaller than had bren expected, but in other areas favorable factors have produced crops exceeding expectations The crop in the North is exceptionally good* and there is every expectation of its being as large or larger than the unusual crop of last year. Parts of Shiraz and Khuzistan suffered an almost complete crop failure. Fortunately the crop and grain stock position throughout the nation is such chat famine conditions will be averted. Grain in considerable quantity is being transported to Bushire, and movement of grain into the crop failure areas : will continue throughout the year. Bread will not be as plentiful in these re gions as would be the case if there had been an adequate local crop. It will consist largely of barley! but the present system of grain control does permit the avoidance of famine conditions. The people of these unfortunate areas need have no fears concerning the continuance of an adequate, although not lavish, supply of bread. It is fortunate that the grain supplies of the nation are marshalled in such a way as to prevent what in other times would have been tragic local famine. It is possible that grain will also have to be transported into parts of Khuzistan later in the year. Arrangements have already been made to supply seed grain for this area. It is possible that as much as 2,500 tons of seed will be needed for the next year’s sowing. Plans have been made to have this amount available if required. Activities in connection with gram collection from the present crop are continuing throughout the country. Village surveys are being made, and stip ulations are being secured from land owners in all regions No. unusualdifficulties are being encountered. Present indications are that the program will be more effective than in former years due to improved organization* more experience on the part of the employees^ a better understanding of the pro gram by landowners and producers, and a general acceptance of the basic principles of the grain-collection work by the people everywhere There has been some objection to the lower price being paid this year. This dissatisfaction* however, does not appear to be widespread nor very in sistent. It does not appear to be affecting the success of the collection activi ties. The fact that there is a very good crop this year, that there are large stocks of grain on hand, and that recent events definitely foreshadow the end of the war in the not distant future, all are eloquent arguments in support of the level of prices established for the current crop. Indeed, it is not im probable that before another crop is harvested present prices may seem extraor dinarily high. Collection and Stock Situation Total stipulations received through month of Ordibehesht 3 36,700 tons Receipts delivered as per statistics received (Reports mostly for the 1st and 15th of Khordad) 336,541 Last year the corresponding figures were: Total stipulations to 15th Khordad * 158*924 Total collections to 15th Khordad 144,836 Tehran Silo Stocks* 31 Khordad 1323 Wheat 8,143 tons Barley 16,961 &gt; Flour 4,663 &gt; Flour (White) 2,580 &gt; Corn 271 &gt; Millet 1,934 &gt; Total J4.552 &gt; Provincial Stocks* 20 Khordad 1323 Wheat 42,983 tons Barley 34,853 Total 77,836 tons Grand Total, Tehran and Provincial Stocks 1 12,388 tonsLast year the combined stocks at Tehran and in the Provinces as of 20 Khordad 1322 were 20,394 tons During the month of Khordad 1323 there were transported to Tehran for the consumption of the City 8,017 tons of grain. During the month of Tir the program of transport of grain to Tehran is 4,200 tons. On 1 Khordad the Bread Administration was transferred to the Cereals and Bread Section. That Administration has been combined with the Silo Division into a new Division entitled the Silo and Bread Division. It is “nder the direction of the former Administrator of the Bread Administration, Colonel Saffari. On 15 Khordad the Rice Administration was transferred to the Cereals and Bread Section. The addition of these activities will require certain internal reorganiza* ion which will be carried out as rapidly as possible and which should result in improved efficiency of operation. Expendit ures Administrative expenses for Khordad of the Cereals and Bread Section, including the Rice Division Rials 16,618,215.50 Sent to provinces for grain purchase &gt; 68,250 000 00 Total Rials 84,868,215.50 The prepartion and investigation of past accounts of Cereals, Bread and Rice are proceeding rapidly, and it is hoped that they will be completed to date in the near future. INTERNAL REVENUES On 1 Khordad the Financial Laws Commission of the Majless approvedthe Income T&lt;«x Regulations? and they were officially communicated to the Internal Revenue Administration on 6 Khordad. They were immediately translated into English, printed in English and Persian, and distributed to the Finance Agents and local tax collecting departments. During the month, in addition to Regulations, five circulars rtlative to the income tax and nine hundred thousand copies of income tax declarations were fo&lt; warded to the various Finance Agents. In spite of the delays encountered in putting into operation the new income tax law and the loss of revenue from the annulment or transfer to the municipalities of certain indirect taxes, revenue receipts for the month under review were very satisfactory. Total receipts were Rls. l^S,329,912.00, as compared with Rls 39,443,724.00 in Khordad 1322. Increases over the corresponding period last year were recorded for income tax, excise on alcoholic beverages, and the gasoline and kerosene tax. The increase in income tax receipts was due to the payment of its 1322 tax, by the Bank Melli; the balance of the collections were arrears and withholdings on 1322 salaries. Income tax declarations are not du° until 3 1 Tir, and the effect of the new income tax law on revenues will first be reflected in collections dur ing Mordad. Returns from excise on alcohol almost tripled in comparison with last year. n During the month a project of a decree increasing the tax on vodka and alcohol and two projects of law increasing the slaughterhouse tax and stamp duties on commercial documents were prepared and submitted. There was also prepared a project of law increasing the tax on petroleum products and a project to tax radios and telephones. The taxes abolished or transferred to municipalities by the income tax law produced Rls. 228,242,874 90 last year. The abovementioned projects were prepared in order partially to cover this loss of revenue. Routine work was carried on by the Concessions, Petroleum and Mines Revenue Department during the month. Several mines were inspected, and new rates for the Guilan Telephone Company were fixed. The collection of the 5 per cent tax on surface mine products, which was transferred to this Department in Farvardin, is not coming up to expectations. Steps are being taken to improve the control and collection of this tax.11 — The Budget The State Budget for 1323 was completed during the month, approved by the Minister of Finance and the Council of Ministers, and submitied to Parliament. Estimates of revenues were: Ordinary: RIs. 3,957,619,660.00 Commercial: Rls. 6,367,182,450.00 Expenditure estimates were: Ordinary: Rls. 4,569,482,444.00 Commeicial: Rls. 5,754,849,275.00. Total receipts foreseen amount to Rls. 10,324,802,110.00 and expenditures to Rls. 10,324,331,719.00 leaving a surplus of Rls. ^70,391.00 The budget is balanced; but to realize the foreseen receipts and to remain within the estimated expenditures will require the best efforts of all members of the Government. Strict economy must be practised, since payment of aid toemj loyets is to be made from savings in the budgetary credits. Eve* ry assistance must also be given the tax collecting officials. Commercial en* terprises of the Government must be operated efficiently on sound principles, if the expected surplus is to be realized. Raw materials must be gotten to the factories when needed and at prices not to exceed those of the market, produc* tion must be increased; and overhead and labor forces must be adjusted ’■o the output of each individual factory. Personnel Conferences are being held on the project for a new Civil Service Law Pending approval of the project by the Government and action by the Maj- less, Mr. Brownrigg and his assistants have starred the preparation of the regulations that will be required by the law and the drafting of temporary instructions to improve the operation of the present system until a new one can be installed We have prepared an instruction relative to the appointment and com pensation of Iranian Deputy Director-Generals and Deputy Directors. In order that a part of my own work may be appropriately delegated. Dr. Black and Mr. Pixley have been appointed Deputy Administrator Gene-T- - 12 - rals of the Finances. Since my report for Farvardm* additional members of the American Mission have arrived and taken up their work: Mr. Davis, in the Internal Revenue Administration; Messrs. Hudson and McKay, in the Administration of Ceded Properties, Public Domains and Exploitation; Mr. Kekich, in the Treasury-General; Mr. Gromehin the Accounts and Audits Administration; Mr. Dozier, in the Distribution Section; and Mr* Plows, in the Isfahan Finan cial Administration. Mr. Luckett has been making studies preliminary to his definite assignment. Mr. Lamb, Mr. Reass and Mr Lang have submitted their resignations Your Excellency will note that certain fields of activity, covered in pre vious reports, are omitted from this one. Due to certain special conditions, which will probably not occur again, some of the responsible heads of the Administrations did not submit their reports to me in time for inclusion in this Report. My next report will, it is hoped, cover all matters, financial and economic. Permit me to convey to Your Excellency the renewed assurances of ray high consideration. A.

I his obligation I am now fulfilling. Due to the difficulties involved in printing, it is necessary to make my reports as brief as possible. Accordingly J am reviewing in the most general way the work of the financial administration and of the connected organizations that are under my exclusive control. Statistics are given only in cases where they illuminate a general situation or are of general interest. In view of the current concern over the work of the American Mission, 'tour Excellency will welcome. I am sure, a presentation b} me of the progress that has been made in various fields and the natnja of the problems that we have been endeavoring to solve. Finally, I have felt that, in my discussion of these matters, Your Excellency would wish me to survey the entire period of fifteen months that has passed since my return to Iran. This period includes the last seven weeks of 1321 and the first month of 1323. Events and Conditions Before Our Arrival In order to appraise our work, it is necessary to understand clearly and evaluate properly certain antecedent events and conditions.It should first be recalled that on two previous occasions the Iranian Government had invited American missions to this country. In addition to these missions, individuals and groups of other nationalities had served i. K the country at different times, in different capacities, and *&gt;' shorter periods. Any thoughtful Iranian who is acquainted with the history of his country during the last forty years will see that certain fundamen a conditions have existed and persisted and that these conditions - political economic, financial, and administrative - have made the employment of foreign advisers and administrators not only desirable but necessary and inevi table. This same thoughtful Iranian will also remember that the American missions, each of whom assumed in the past as at present substantial authority and responsibility, coped with serious difficulties and encountered opposition from one quarter or another. In fact, difficulties and opposition arc inherent in such a task. If difficulties or the probability of opposition had not existed, we would never have been needed in this country or invited to it. 1&lt;or about fifteen years prior to the events of Shahrivar 1320, Iran had been under a governmental regime which may be credited with much constructive work but must also be charged with certain effects that were fundamentally reactionary and degenerative. This regime, as might have been expected, exerted a particularly powerful influence throughout the administrative and official classes and among the private individuals outside who were most closely in contact with the Government. All individuals were not affected in the same way, and some were probably not affected at all; but a large number of those persons, who should have given us administrative assistance and official support, had lost in seiious measure, those qualities on which the success of our work depended-honesty, courage, capacity for initiative and leadership, the feeling ol personal security and of freedom, loyalty, devotion to duty, the sense of responsi bility, the willingness and ability to account for public funds, reliance on hard work and meritorious performance for advancement, adaptability to reforms and new systems, readiness to obey orders and regulations, and respect for the spirit of the law. The obstacles thus created were intangible, but they seriously delayed and arc still delaying the progress of our work. It should also be noted that, under the dictatorial regime, theGovernment had taken on operations and controls, with respect to industry, commerce, and banking, of the most complex and difficult nature. Ok tutorship touched, controlled and warped to its will every phase of government and economic life; but the end of dictatorship came suddenly in 1320 (1941), with no preparation for an orderly transition to a regime of free constitutional government, the result was disorganization and widespread disorder, followed by a persistent weakness of government. J he entrance of the Allied forces into Iran helped in some respects, but did little to strengthen the governmental and administrative situation as it was to affect our work. Before the events of Shahrivar, the war had been going on for about two &gt; ears, cutting off trade, creating a scarcity of goods, increasing pur chasing power, and contributing to inflationary tendencies. At the time of m &gt; nrri\al, prices had increased generally about seven times. Strong control was needed over both purchasing power and goods supply; but the measures taken by the Government had proved almost totally ineffective. I he one promising feature was a sound currency; but this, too, was in grave danger because of the increasing cost of government, the sharply dec ieased rc\enues, and the waste involved in the industrial and commercial activities of the Government. Political and economic conditions aggravated the psychological factors previously mentioned. A speculative mania accelerated inflation; while inflation, speculation, and the sharp decline in the purchasing power of employees salaries - in most cases below * living wage - added to the prevail ing corruption. Without doubt, revolutionary tendencies existed: and these added to the general feelings of insecurity and fear. In many countries, the situation just described would have been considered hopeless. It is obvious that forces were at work which could not be overcome until after the end of the war; and, in any event, adverse influences and trends were so deeply rooted and of such long standing that they could not possibly be checked or reversed in a few months. Responsibility for Solving the Problem lo appraise our work fairly, it is likewise necessary to understand that the American Mission is not alone in Iran. It is not the Government of the country.We have been, and are. dependent on the Majless foe legal autho rity to act administratively, to collect revenues, to borrow, and to spend. In manV respects, we must go to the Council of Ministers for authority The Army, the Gendarmerie, the Police, the Courts are outside of our jurisdiction; but their assistance and cooperation arc necessary to the suc cess of our work. For some time, we had no administrative authority over grain collection, monopoly goods, and road transport. In the provinces, the Governor-Generals and Governors, responsible to the Ministry ol the Inter ior. arc influential and were charged originally with interference in all ,vf nrnvinoial administrations. The country’s railways, a part of its communication system: some ol the ports and customs establishments, and certain other facilities have been in the hands of the Allied authorities. Spending by the Allies within the country has contributed to inflation and prevented freedom of action in dealing with the problem of purchasing power. The Middle East Supply Centre has exercised vital controls over the country’s supply of goods. In the fixing of responsibility, as well as in the giving of credit, these other authorities must be taken into account. The American Mission cannot be wholly blamed that accomplishment has been delayed and has fallen short of perfection. On the other hand, these other authoi- ities, especially the Allies, should be credited with important contribu tions to the stability of the country and to the welfare of the people. The Food Supply Primary importance attaches to the food supply of the people, (.rain and bread have long been monopolized by the Government; and the ad ministration of the monopoly is a responsibility of the first magntiude. When I returned to Iran, this responsibility had been transferred from tho Ministry of Finance to a new Ministry of Food ( or Supply ), and agencies independently of the financial departments had been established in the provinces. This major mistake in organization, combined with the political direction of the new Ministry, was one of the causes of the deplorable situation that developed, it is true that the harvest in 1321 was poor; but this fact made efficient and honest administration all the more im perative. When I arrived and during the months that followed, inefficiency and corruption in this administration became a public scandal, lo this day.I ^ gal autho- to spend. authorit)A de of our o the sue- ority over vinres, the the Inter nee in all n, some of have been vithin the action in ist Supply goods. of credit, m Mission ayed and r author- contribu- ople. pie. Grain id the ad- nagntiude. J from tha d agencies ed in the c political deplorable was poor; more im- nefficiency o this day, — o we have not been able to present the complete and final accounts of this Ministry s vast and reckless expenditures. Shortly before my arrival, des tructive bread riots had taken place in Tehran; reports reached me of starvation or of malnutrition in provincial towns. Soup kitchens and bread queues were common. Tor several weeks, the Tehran silo had no reserve of grain whatever. General alarm existed. 1 was repeatedly urged to take charge of this administration, and. finally, with considerable reluctance, accepted the responsibility. The Cere als and Bread Section was established: new regulations were issued; in spite of much clamor, with respect to both grain-collection and bread- distribution, sound policies were adopted and consistently followed; and reforms in the organization and personnel were gradually introduced. I he change was made on t Mordad B122, about seven months ago. No more bread-riots occurred. Tranquillity replaced anxiety and clamor. Bread was supplied in ample quantity and of better quality. Grain-collections have now practically reached the high goal that we set for ourselves. We had hoped to collect 350,000 tons, to supply all the commitments of ihe Government this year and to leave us with a substantial surplus with which to start the next year’s collection program. According to our latest reports (which are mostly from 15 to 30 days old) over 335,000 tons have already been collected and another 10 to 15 thousand tons have probably been already purchased but not yet reported. Our stock on hand in the country as a whole is 117,220 tons and in the Tehran Silo 27,808 tons, enough to supply the country for at least one month after the collec tion of the new harvest has started. As collections are still continuing in some areas, and stocks are regularly being shipped to Tehran, it is quite certain that when the new crop collection actually starts, our position wdll he even more favorable than it is at present. While we are thankful that the 1322 harvest was good, it is evident that the abundant harvest did not alone account for our success. We have had better administration and, of course, have received the continued co operation of the Allies. I desire to express my appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. Crawford, Acting Chief Administrator of the Cereals and Bread Section, his assistants, official and unofficial, and the Middle East Supply Centre staff, as well as to the American, British and Soviet author ities who in many ways cooperated with us.— (&gt; — Iii spite of the pessimistic prospects some weeks ago, the 1323 crop may not he far below normal. We should have a better organized collec tion program and an improved transportation system. Under the direction of Dr. Black, who has recently arrived, the Cereals and Bread Section should not only take good care of the country’s food supply, but accom plish this important task more economically and, it is expected, with prompt and regular accounting. Prices The Majless passed on 13 Ordibehesht 1322 a law vesting substantial powers in me to control commodities for the purpose of stabilizing prices. I lie fact has been pointed out repeatedly in my monthly reports that this law and its execution could not be expected alone to lower or stabilize prices. Other measures were necessary; and many of these have been taken, although in some cases after serious delays. For such delays, the effeesjoj which are now being felt, the American Mission was in no way responsible. Moreover, the execution of the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 1322 required the creation of a practically new organization in the capital and in the provinces. I his organizing work necessarily took time. I he task of organizing and administering the economic controls en trusted to us required additional American personnel. To provide such per sonnel, 1 proposed and the Government submitted to the Majless a project of law for the engagement of sixty Americans. Unfortunately the passage of this law was long delayed; and the effects of this delay are now being felt, since it was impossible, without this law, to complete the organization and obtain anything like effective administration. I he general result was a prolonged lag, during which goods congested at the ports, imports were reduced, and distribution could be carried out only to a limited extent. Only during recent months has it been possible to catch up with this lag. At the present time, 1 can report that, although enormous difficulties still confront us, and although the vicious inflationary circle has not been finally broken, the situation has markedly improved. We feel reasonably certain that, in spite of the restrictions imposed by the war, supplies of the staple commodities will be ample for distribution throughout the country on the basis of fair rations and relatively low prices. With an increasingly efficient organization covering every stage ofthe process, actual distribution, under (he direction of Mr Ferguson is proceed,ng at a rapidly accelerating rate. Congestion in the Customs has now been eliminated. Sugar, tea and cotton piece-goods are being moved in substantial quantities to distribution centers throughout the country. Ration- i' 1 ' an(1 lhe (,lstribu tion of coupons in the cities and towns have measur- ably improved. The Central Store in Tehran has been opened and has for some tune been doing a gratify,ngly large volume of business. During the period of lag, merchants’ business was necessarily curtailed and their pro fits reduced; but, in the next few months, merchants will be given (heir equitable share of trade, provided they are willing to forego exorbitant gains. Rent control has been in operation for several months. Speculation in real-estate appears to have practically stopped. Measures have been taken to Stabilize wages and the prices of agricultural raw-materials. We have cooperated effectively to increase industrial production. Quotas have been established for the factories, (foods congested there are being moved. It should be remembered, however, that the collection of raw materials - a most me icient, wasteful and in some respects scandalous, procedure - as well as the operation of the factories, has been almost entirely under the control of other Ministries. In general, the rise of prices has been slowed up, although during recent months certain events and rumours caused another flurry of specu- iation and a rise of prices- in the black-market. It is obviously impossible in my reports to state in detail the actions ta en by us. Because of this fact and because of the legitimate and intense interest shown in this subject by the Government and the deputies of the Majless. I have taken every possible step to keep the Government and Majless fully and currently informed of our actions, our program for the future, and the progress of our work. Transportation I ransportation is vital to the success of the supply and stabilization program. Before our arrival, a Boad I ransport Department had been hurriedly established under the supervision of an international board and under the immediate direction of Mr. Birkle. With (he cooperation of the United Slates Lend-Lease Administration, trucks and tires were procured. Iranian trucks were placed under contract.— 8 — I'rom that time, transport operations were seriously handicapped by lack of qualified personnel, by absence of adecpiate maintenance facilities, by the prevailing profiteering and corruption, by insufficient means of control of traffic on the roads, and by lack of a planning and coordinating organization. In the month of Khordad 1322. ( 23 June - 22 July 1943 ) the first steps were taken to place the Road Transport Department under my control; that is. to bring it within the Iranian Government organization. During the month of Dey, 1322 (December 23 - January 21, 1943), Mr. Shields and his associates took over the direction of the Road Trans port Administration. They have been on the job about five months. They have been assisted in various ways by the Allies. Transportation is now an activity of the Iranian Government. The personnel situation has improved. Dishonest practices have been vigorously dealt with and measurably curtailed. Additional trucks have been obtained. Maintenance facilities in Iran have been acquired and are being more efficiently utilized. The procurement of additional spare parts and repair machinery is in process. Effective control is being established on the roads. The custody and maintenance of Government automobiles have been trans ferred to the Road Transport Administration. A 1 ransport Priorities Office, under Mr. Schuckman, has been set up for the planning and unified control of the movement of goods, for the coordination of rail and truck transport, and for the allocation of the use of Government automobiles. Gratifying improvement is taking place with respect to the financial opera tions of the Road 1 ransport Administration. I feel confident that within the near future we shall have a Govern ment transportation enterprise paying its own, way, efficiently operated, and making its full contribution to the economic progress of Iran. Industry While the Government mines and factories are directly administered by the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, we have endeavored, wi thin the limits of our powers, to place these important and sadly mismanaged undertakings on a proper financial and economic basis. For this purpose, as well as to coordinate our own various activities as they related to industry, an Industrial Supervision Administration was established. Now,under the direction of Mr. Vivian, this Administration has been engaged in the compilation of industrial requirements, the procurement of machin ery and parts, the making of sales, the movement of raw materials, the fixing of wages and prices, the preparation of workmen’s insurance regu lations, and the drafting of a fundamental project for the reorganization of Government industrial administration. Plans for the Post W ar Period In spite of the pressure of current work, much of it of an emer gency character, we have been able to give some attention to the situation that will confront Iran in the post-war period. At that time we shall have complex and interrelated problems involving the currency, foreign exchange, falling prices, foreign trade policy, budgetary readjustment, unemployment, the settlement of claims, property transfers, and internal security. We are now organizing for the prompt and proper handling of these problems. Continuity ol Policies and Programs I he members of the Government and the deputies of the Majless need not lie reminded that serious loss of time and irreparable damage would be caused by r any drastic change in organization or by aiw new division of responsibility. Great advantages will come to Iran if the same organization that handles the war situation is entrusted with the hand- ling of post-war economic problems. Human organizations are never perfect; but this is no time for returning to schemes which, before the arrival of the American Mission, had utterly failed, or lor trying new schemes which would delay and disrupt operations that are now being conducted with constantly increased efficiency 7 and constantly better results. Coordination of Economics and Finance it is true that 1 was brought to Iran to reorganize and direct the financial administration; but economic problems are so closely tied in with financial problems that, under the conditions existing in Iran, they must be handled in accordance with a single comprehensive program, in such a way as to insure proper timing and prevent conflict. Furthermore, in this time of emergency and in the equally critical post-war period, it is highly10 desirable for the Iranian Government &lt;o maintain a unified organization to assist and advise the Government in its economic and financial relations with the Allied Powers. ^ In my opinion, the responsibilities that the American Mission lias assumed in the economic sphere have been essential to the performance of its financial task. I would go further and say that the assumption of both economic and financial work has made our task as a whole easier, rather than harder. Banking and Currency Activities in the fields of banking and currency are. in effect, both economic and financial. When 1 arrived in Iran, 1 found the National Bank of Iran in sound condition and under capable management. During the first lew days, however, a project was introduced into the Majless to change the method of choosing the Governor of the Bank, a change that would have been, in my opinion, disastrous to the Bank. 1 advised strongly against the pro posed change, and, fortunately, it was not made. Since then, the Bank has been free of political attack, has enjoyed continuity of policy, and has merited the increasing confidence that it receives from the people . The cordial cooperation that has existed between the Bank and the American Mission has been highly advantageous both to the Bank and the Government. The directorates of the Agricultural Bank, the Mortgage Bank, and the Insurance Company have been changed in part and on the whole strengthened. The operations of the banks have been subjected to close and whole some scrutiny. Greater efforts have been made to protect the interests of the Government as the sole shareholder, while safeguarding the interests of the banks. In some institutions, certain loose practices that prevailed in the past have been eliminated. Chiefly as an anti-inflationary measure, provisions were included in the Income-Tax Law for the encouragement of savings; and we are gratified over the increase of bank deposits that has taken place.In (he development and execution of the Governments fiscal poli cies. the National Bank has effectively cooperated; and we have passed through a succession of fiscal crises with no undue strain on either the Bank or the Treasury. I he soundness of the currency has been maintained. Sales of gold and silver have been profitable to both the Bank and the (ioverument and have helped to reduce purchasing power and stabilize prices. Debt In spite of the unavoidable deficit, we have been able to avoid foreign borrowing, and we are confident that we can do so in the future, provided the Government and the Majless safeguard the revenues and cooperate in the control of expenditures. for the first time in the history of Iran, an internal loan has been floated. 1 his was proposed by us and approved bv the Majless as a means of combatting inflation, as well as for the purpose of financing the Govern ment. I he balance in the I reasury Bond Account at the end of Farvar- din 1323 (20 April 1944) was Bis. 176,580,000. I he total internal indebtedness at the end of l arvardin was about Bis. 4,500,000,000. In addition an amount of about Bis. 700,000,000 had been put at the disposal of Ministries and Administrations and had not been used. As a partial offset to the Government debt, the Treasury General had various foreign exchange holdings amounting to approximately Bis. 111,000,000. It should be added that the above figures do not take account of various claims by or against the Government. Financial Position The ordi nary receipts of (he Treasury General in 1322, as reported by Mr. Le Count, Treasurer-General, were about 43 per cent more than in 1321. I reasury General disbursements in the ordinary account increased about 53 per cent. Beceipts in the commercial account were about 25 per cent more in 1322, than in 1321, but, in 1322. disbursements in the commercial account increased 30 per cent, compared with 1321. I he following is a summary of receipts, payments and deficits in 1321 dan 1322 (000's omitted):12 — Ordinary Payments Ordinary Receipts 3,990,905 3,550,994 Deficit 118,778 439,911 Commercial Payments Commercial Receipts Deficit 932,834 Total Payments Total Receipts Total Deficit 5,006,119 4,853,514 752,605 1,372,745 The above figures, it will be understood, are not the linal figures of income and outgo during these two years. Final ligures depend on the receipt and auditing of all accounts. Moreover, a complete and fair compa rison of the two years would include amounts representing unsettled claims and unpaid obligations. No doubt can exist that the actual financial situa tion of the Government was better in 1322 than in 1321. Moreover, these figures do not take into account stocks of goods and other realizable assets on hand at the end of each year. It is believed that these were considerably greater at the end of 1322 than at the end of 1321. zation program: and, as soon as requisite study could be given to the problem, we prepared and presented to the Government a project for a new Income- Tax Law. It was promptly submitted by the Government to the Majless. mission and was not approved by the Majless until the closing days of the session. Even then, changes were made that reduced the amount of revenue collectable under the law. Because of this delay, because of the absence ol a Majless, and because of changes of Governments, delay has also occurred in the approval of the Regulations by the Financial Laws Commission. The Regulations had been prepared by us at the beginning of the year, but, because ol Internal Revenues An increase ol taxation was an essential feature of our price stabili Lnfortunately, it was delayed for weeks in the financial Laws Com-&lt;Icluys in the Ministry of Finance and in the Commission, they were not yet approved seven weeks alter the beginning of the year. This delay has caused losses oI revenue, and, of course, has substantially diminished the an ic.pated effect ol the law on prices. Prices are greatly influenced by taxation: and it is deeply regretted that we have not been able to use this potent weapon as promptly and as effectively as it might have been Every effort was made to prevent loss ol revenue from the delay in piming into effect the new law. Circulars and forms were prepared to be distributed immediately upon approval of the regulations. Notices were nut in the newspapers and circulars were distributed advising that the tax was collectable from the first of Farvardin and tax payers should take the necessary precautions, particularly regarding the deductions from employees' salaries and payments to contractors. Finance Agents were instructed to concentrate on the collections of arrears due under the old law. Although no reports have been received from the provinces, results obtained in Tehran were very satisfactory; although, of course, little was or could be collected under the new law. In general, under the direction of Mr. Monk, the Internal Revenue dministration is expected to operate with increasing efficiency from now on. Because of the fact that our expectations from the income-tax law are not likely to be realized during the present year, we shall propose projects for new or supplementary sources of revenue. Other Revenues In later reports, I hope to present figures showing the revenues col- ceted m 1322 by the Customs Administration, the Opium and Tobacco Monopolies, the Ceded Properties, and the Public Domains. Accounts and Audits I he budgetary and accounting system carries the master-key to successful financial administration. The effectiveness of such a system depends on many factors: (1) care and promptness in the preparation of the budget, not only in the Ministry of Finance, but in all of the other Ministries and independent establishments of the Government; (2) a sound and impartial examination of (he budget by the Council of Ministers;(3) (he scrutiny of the budget by the Budget Commission from the point of view of the financial needs of the Government and the welfare of the country; (4) the discussion and approval of the budget in the Majless; (5) control by the Ministry of Finance and particularly by the Accounts and Audits Administration of payments under the budget; (6) accounting for receipts and payments by trained and honest accountants; (7) prompt rendering of accounts; (H) expeditious auditing of accounts and settlement of claims; and, finally, (9) full and clear reporting of all financial operations to the Government, the Majless, and the public. In Iran, at the present moment, the above represent ideals or objectives, rather than established facts. It will take a long time to introduce order and control into the confused situation that existed on our arrival and, to a great extent, still exists, although progress along many lines has been made. W hen we came, we found a woeful lack of qualified accountants. Worst of all, the feeling of accountability, of responsibility for public funds, of trusteeship, was generally absent. Accounts were far in arrears. No reliable statistics were to be had and practically no reports had been published. Numerous letters were written, but apparently with no pur pose to settle cases. Simplicity in organization and procedure had given way to complexity. The fundamental desire for economy and the organized means of compelling economy had disappeared. Quite generally, we found a habit of resisting and obstructing investigation and of concealing or evading the truth. Confusion in the personnel laws, regulations and pro cedures produced inequities and delay in the fixing and payment of sala ries. Unauthorized obligations were incurred by various Ministries, and budgetary obligations were left unpaid. We found in full swing certain tendencies, the effect ol which was to scatter financial responsibility and reduce financial control. Elliciency in the industrial and commercial enterprises of the Government recpiires a certain amount of decentralization and of freedom in financial transactions. On the plea that freedom was required, those in charge of such enterpris es were attempting and are still attempting to escape all financial con trol. The legal and judicial system that had grown up gave to courts and to arbitration boards the power to settle claims and create obligations against the Government. Usually, courts and arbitrators, lor reasons best known to ihem, decided against the Government. In the presence of cleverschemes and unscrupulous schemers, operating underjhe cover of a hypo critical legality, the Ministry of Finance stood practically helpless. Obviously, the first and fundamental need is a centralized agency for financial control, manned by capable and honest officials, determined to protect the financial interests of the Government. The present Accounts and Audits Administration, headed by Mr. Pixley, and his American and Iranian assistants, is now giving us a starting point for reform. Gradually improvement is taking place, and I am convinced that it will steadily con tinue. We shall have a better budget this year and we shall make further headway in the regularizing of financial operations and in the preventing of irregularities and waste. During the last month, the personnel of the Accounts and Audits Administration is reported to be working efficiently and cheerfully; the work of preparing the 132:1 budget is actively proceeding; a study of payment and accounting procedure is under way; certain chief accountants were transferred; and steps have been taken to install new accounting systems in the I reasury-General and in certain commercial operations. Inspections and Prosecutions When we took up our work, the Ministry of Finance had a group of inspectors without a head. An Administration of General Inspection was promptly established and placed under the direction of Mr. Zelli. Recent- l\. Mr. \yman has been appointed my Special Assistant for investigatory work. J he Accounts and Audits Administration, through its auditors and special agents, is making its important contribution to the discovery and correction of irregularities. For example, during the past month further shortages have been found in the accounts of the Ministry of Justice. Infor mal reports indicate that a substantial part of the shortage in the accounts of the Cereals and Bread Administration has been recovered and deposited with the competent court. No report has been received from the Ministry of War relative to the Bis. 1,500,000 advance to a contractor for the pur chase of rice. 1 hus far, I am informed, the rice has not been received, nor has the money been returned. Our success in checking irregularities in the handling of public funds depends, of course, on the cooperation of the Ministry of Justice. We are keeping a record of cases presented to that Ministry for prosecution; and 11 intention to include in subsequent reports a statement ofr — u&gt; — the action taken on these eases by the prosecutors and the courts. In addi tion. I have asked the Ministry of Justice to report its activiiies in connec tion with the prosecution and trial of persons accused of embezzling or ^ otherwise mishandling public funds. Such a report will be of great help to the Ministry of Finance and interesting also to the Majless and the public. We have no desire or purpose to protect any of our officials who are or may be suspected of misdeeds: but, on the other hand, we cannot be held responsible for the financial and economic work entrusted to us, if our officials are to be arrested by agents of other Ministries without our prior knowledge and approval. Such action is contrary to the Law of my Engagement. Approval will always be given and our officials will be promptly suspended from the service when the evidence against them is sufficient to justify suspension. It should be apparent that, while we want our guilty employees punished, we cannot have our work disrupted and our officials harassed on flimsy pretexts or as the result of intrigues and self-interested motives. During the month of Farvardin, the Inspection Commission of Dis tricts 3 and 4 continued successfully to detect the activities of the accused employees of Kharbar and Finance Departments. The Inspection Commis sion at Zanjan are investigating the indictment dossiers of the Kharbar and Finance offices. The Inspection Commission at Hamadan are continuing their inspections, and their reports have been studied. I he Inspection Com mission at Kashan has completed its work and been recalled to the Center. The Inspection Commission in District 9 has investigated the charges brought against the former and present Kharbar and Finance employees. Furthermore they have detected important misappropriations in the Sugar Factory of Abkuh. Consequently the responsible employees of the factory as well as the ex-Kharbar Manager were arrested and investigated. The Inspection Commission in Guilan is inspecting the affairs pertaining to Kharbar and Finance, the results of which will be later reported. Since certain reports have been received regarding the operations of the Kermanshah Kharbar Manager and employees, an inspector has been assigned to investigate the matter. The Investigation Commission of the accounts of the lease-hold pro perties of Karaj did not continue its work in Farvardin due to the failureon ihe part of the Exploitation and Public Domains Institute and the Accounts Department of the Ministry of Agriculture to send their representa- A tives . Ihe C ommission assigned to investigate the accounts of the Tehran Municipality is continuing its work, and its reports arc being appropriately acted upon. In order to investigate the distribution of monopoly goods, a Com mission headed by Mr. Rusta is investigating and examining the pertinent dossiers. The findings will be reported later. Misappropriations perpetrated by the employees concerned with the sugar quota of Shahsawar have been uncovered. Mr. Hossein Azimi. a Kharbar employee who was accused of stealing several tons of sugar, was apprehended and made certain confessions. In the course of investigation, other dishonest pratices, such as the misappropriation of piece-goods were discovered. I he case is now under investigation and prosecution. According to a report recently received, another truck-load of sugar being carried from the Karaj Factory to the warehouse of the Distribution Section was stolen and did not reach the warehouse. I his matter is under investigation, and the relative dossier has been referred to (he Penal Court for prosecution. \\ ith regard to the charge of embezzlement brought against Engineer Nikoumanesh, the Technical Director of ihe Glycerine Factory, the case has been investigated and the relative dossier referred to the Penal Court. Ihe Commission assigned to the lehran Silo is continuing its ins pections. The reports furnished by the said Commission have been sent to the Cereals and Bread Section. I lie important success achieved by this Commission is the ascertain ment of surplus grain in the warehouse. Personnel Ihe condition in which we found the Personnel and Pension Depart ments was one of congestion, delay, and absence of sound procedures and principles. I his condition accounted in part for the dissatisfaction of the employees. I hese departments were combined in a single Personnel Admin istration; and this Administration, now directed bv Mr. Brownrigg, has largely cleared up the back-log ol work, and solved many troublesomeproblems which had impeded administration. Progress has been made in the installation of new procedures; a central inquiry office has been esta blished; the Heemployment Commission has been incorporated in the ^ Personnel Administration; and a new Civil Service Law has been drafted. Government Supplies When we came to Iran, the administration of government supplies was scattered; and, in this field, waste and corruption were matters of common knowledge. We proposed, and the Council ol Ministers approved, the establishment of a State General Supply Corporation, in which procure ment, custody, and distribution are centralized. 1 o this Corporation, various agencies have been transferred, including the Construction Department of the Ministry of Commerce and Industries. 1 his Corporation now is responsible for the procurement of supplies, the control of the Govern ments movable properties, the custody and disposal of surplus proper ties, the construction and repair of government buildings, the renting of buildings, and the allocation of space. Substantial economies will result Irom this centralization ol activi ties and responsibilities. Under its Director-General Mr. Hansen, the ( or- poration is now well organized, and efficient procedures have been estab lished. During the past month, total purchases amounted to Ills. 7,026,(&gt;41, and purchase orders numbered 170. As an example of the present activi ties of the Corporation, it may be added that, during the month of I'ar- vardin, the Corporation recovered 888 pieces of office furniture and equipment, delivered to using agencies 388 pieces of such recovered goods, and repaired 179 pieces of recovered furniture. W hen we came to Iran, quantities of valuable material belonging to the Government, including machinery and structual iron and timber, were lying in various warehouses and yards throughout the country. This mater ial was being stolen and, to a serious extent, was in process of deteriora tion. Some progress has been made in getting control of this exceedingly valuable property and putting it to use. I his task, however, has been one of very great difficulty; and we have not received in all cases the needed cooperation from the departments which had this property in their posses sion.19 — Correspondence and Archives In the course of the reorganization of the Ministry of Finance, a De partment of Correspondence and Archives has been established, separate from the Minister's Cabinet. This Department operates as a part of the financial administration. On the whole, under the direction of Mr. Davoud Pirnia, gratifying improvement has occurred in the handling of the Minis try’s correspondence and files. Much remains to be done, especially with reference to the handling of letters and telegrams in the correspondence department of the various administrations and sections. Defects are most evident in the new economic organizations. Personnel Changes Americans working in the Ministry of f inance and the connected organizations now number thirty-nine. Thirteen others are engaged, and some of these are on their way. Dr. Albert G. Black has arrived and has taken up his duties as Chief Administrator of the Cereals and Bread Section. Mr. Gordon has proceeded to Meshed as provincial Director-General of Finance; and. in a similar capacity, Mr. Murray has gone to Shiraz, Mr. I ribon to Kerman, and Mr. Hutchinson to Kermanshah. Mr. Harrison has been assigned to the Accounts and Audits Administration. Mr. Boone ap pointed Special Assistant in my office, and Mr. Nyman transferred to my oil ice as Special Assistant. In closing, permit me to express to Your Excellency the assurances of my distinguished consideration. A.

Your Excellency: I have the honor to submit herewith my report for the month of Bahman, 1322 (January 22 - February 20, 1944). Your Excellency is aware that, in general, despite the enormous difficulties of our task and the extraordinary complications that beset us, constant progress is being made; and 1 wish once more to express the appreciation of myself and my American associates for the sympathy and helpful cooperation that Your Excellency, your colleagues in the Govern ment, deputies of the Majless, and others have extended to us. Our work cannot be brought to a successful conclusion without such cooperation. At the present moment, criticisms of various sorts are being made of the Finan cial Mission and its activities. We welcome criticisms and suggestions. We know that many of our Iranian friends have knowledge, experience, sincerity, and sound judgment. We need their counsel. Permit me to say, however, that criticisms are most helpful when the following considerations are kept in mind: 1. That the task of placing the finances and the economic life of the country on a sound and safe foundation during this abnormal and critical period is a task of enormous difficulty, which cannot be accomplishedquickly. Our critics, therefore, should take these difficulties into considera tion and should first inquire, not whether everything is being done in a perfect manner and with perfect results, but whether we are proceeding in the right direction, and, considering all the circumstances, whether reason- * able progress is being made. 2. Before a criticism is propagated, an effort should be made to obtain the relevant facts. We are pressed with work, but we shall be glad to supply information to any responsible person who is disposed to criticize. 3. Personal acquaintanceship is most helpful. \\ hen people are stran gers, they are likely to misunderstand one another. So far as time permits, let us confer together and seek to understand one another’s opinions and intentions. If we proceed with our cooperative adventure in this spirit, we shall make faster and surer progress. 4. It should be understood that the American f inancial Mission is concerned with the welfare of the whole people of Iran. We hope to do justice to individuals, but their interests, convenience and comfort must inevitably be subordinated to the general welfare. The Financial Situation and Operations I he receipts and expenditures of the Iranian Government fall into two main classes: (1) the ordinary, and (2) the commercial. In both categories, the accuracy of our figures cannot yet be guaranteed. They must be viewed as approximate; but they are believed to be good enough to show the financial trend during the year and the present situation. In general these figures provide the basis on which the Government andMajless will estab lish the budgetary policy for next year (1323). I he following comparative table submitted by the Treasurer-General, Mr. LeCount, shows the ordinary receipts by months for 1321 and for the first ten months of 1322.— 7 — Summary of Receipts, Payments, and Deficit, at End Dey . 1321 and 1322 1321 1322 Ordinary Payments 2.114,187 3.275,496 Ordinary Receipts 2.056.994 3,066.721 Deficit 57.193 208,775 Commercial Payments 2,599,105 3,365.934 Commercial Receipts 1,902.251 2,331,947 Deficit 696,854 1,033,987 Total Payments 4,713,292 6.641,430 dotal Receipts 3,959,245 5.398,668 Total Deficit 754,047 1,242,762 It will be seen from the above figures that our major financial prob lem is created by the commercial operations of the Government, and that th e losses in these operations account in large part for the deficits in 1-121 and 1322. The grain operations of the Government have been a major factor in producing the commercial loss. 1 he deficit in grain operations is due in the main to the discrepancy in the price of grain purchased and bread sold. The Government has been heavily subsidizing the food of the people. Due to the deficit in our current financial operations, it has been necessary to borrow from the Bank Melli Iran; and, since the notes paid out by the Bank do not return to the Bank in sufficient quantities, it is necessary to pay a part of the expenses of the Government in new notes. Unfortunately, in Bahman we were notified that a delay of about three weeks would occur in the printing of notes in Great Britain and in their dispatch. In cooperation wiih (he Governor of the Bank we took every possible step to expedite both the printing and the transport of the notes, but, due to the scarcity of notes and the uncertainty concerning their ar rival, we were forced to postpone certain payments and to exercise (lie utmost caution in committing ourselves to new or additional spending. After a long delay, the Treasury Bonds were received from the printers and put on sale. At the end ot Bahman bonds having a face value of Bis. 5,370,000 had been sold to the public and an amount of Bis. 48.730,000 was invested in bonds from various l reasury-Genera 1 accounts, bringing the total sales for the month to Bis. 54,300,000. Since that date and up to the8 — writing of this report, additional sales occurred aggregating RIs.-101,609,000. According to some of the propaganda that has been directed at the Financial Mission, it is our intention to recommend a loan from foreign countries. Such a statement is utterly misleading. As a matter of general policy, we do not favor borrowing from foreign countries, and we would not recommend any such borrowing unless we were convinced that it would be to the interest of the Iranian Government and people. No such borrow ing should be necessary during the coming year unless the budget of the Government is swollen to an unmanageable size, or unless a serious reduc tion occurs in receipts. Neither eventuality is now anticipated. Currency I he following information has been kindly prepared at my request by Mr. A. H. Ebtehaj, ( iovernor of the Rank Melli, and 1 take the occasion to express again my satisfaction over the fruitful and pleasant cooperation that has taken place between the Bank Melli and the Ministry of Finance. One of the successes achieved during the year 1322 is the consolidation of the monetary system of Iran by the conversion into gold of part of the silver reserve and the selling of gold and silver by the banks, a policy which has so far given satisfactory results, and it is hoped that, by the continuation of the policy which the Bank Melli Iran has adopted and is putting into pratice, better results may yet be achieved. Although the advantage of a gold over a silver cover for notes is now r universally accepted, nevertheless, we mention in brief a few points regarding the production and price of gold and silver. 1 he total world production of silver from the date of the discovery of America to the end of 1941 was 1 &lt;.500.000.000/- line ounces, whereas the the gold production for the same period was about 1/12 of this figure, or 1,450,000,000/- fine ounces. 1 he price of silver during the forty years from 1872 up to the begin ning of the first world war has steadily decreased, and one country after another has adopted the gold standard in place of the silver standard. ( hma was the last country to give up the silver standard in 1935. During this period the price ol silver per ounce standard fell from 60 5/16 pence to 255/16 pence, and, if there was by chance a slight increase in some excep tional years, this increase did not exceed one tenth of the average price. Conditions arising after the war caused a world-wide demand for silver for monetary and other purposes from 1916 to 1920, and consequentlyoen- llie price reached 8 ( &gt; 1/2 pence, thus surpassing even that of the last tury. But this upward trend was temporary and did not last for long. As a result of a slackening demand on the part of China and India and an increased output, there was a sudden depreciation in the price of silver, ihe downward movement beginning from 30 5/8 pence in 1921, to 14 7/16 pence in 1930, and finally reaching the record low level of about 12 pence in 1931. In 1933, the silver convention was signed in London according to which the silver producing countries undertook to subject the production, sale, and export of silver to special regulations. Subsequently, in 1934. the silver purchase act was passed in America authorizing the United States Government to hold silver as part of its monetary reserve up to 25 percent. Thus backed by the l nited States, the price of silver rose artificially and reached 22 3/8 pence per ounce in 1936; but this revival was not maintained. Depreciation set in again, and the price fell to 16 1/16 in 1939 just before the present war. As shown above, the price of silver has always been liable to violent fluctuation and is therefore in no way suitable for monetary reserve. This instability of the price of silver has been the main reason for the abandon ment of the silver standard and the gradual decrease of ihe use of silver for monetary purposes. The countries which had abandoned the silver standard and adopted the gold standard put great quantites of silver on the market and purchased gold in its stead. • On the other hand, in comparison with the fluctuating price of silver, ihe price of gold has been relatively stable owing to the limitation of its output and of the available stocks. Until 1919 it remained fixed at an average of 77 shillings and 9 pence per ounce. Then, after fluctuating for about seven consecutive years, ihe price stabilized at 84/11 from 1926 to 1930; then there followed an upward movement in 1931 and finally the price was fixed at 168 shillings in 1939. for these reasons, Iran must sooner or later adopt gold as its ex clusive metallic reserve whose price and production will be less liable to fluctuations. Ihe Bank Melli Iran, following this policy, has ordered as follows, from 9 Mordad 1322 (1 August 1943) to 4 Esfand 1322 (24 Lebruary 1944), the equivalent of $12,020,000 of gold from New York, Moscow, and South Alriea, part of which has already arrived in Tehran and the remain der is either on the way or awaiting transportation to Iran: u10 Remainder i Ordered from America $10,020,000 - arrived in Tehran $6,516,000 ready for shipmen t Mention must he made here of the assistance accorded in this res pect by the three Allied coutries; for, in spite of present difficulties and the shortage of means of transport, they have favorably considered the application of the Bank Melli Iran, and rendered every help and assistance by transporting the gold consignments by the swiftest means of transport and in the shortest time possible. I he greater part of the purchased gold has been added, at the legal rate, to the reserve of Rls. 3,500,000.000 notes issued before 28 A ban 1321 (19 November 1942). In its stead, an equivalent amount of silver, at the legal rate, has been taken out of the reserve and placed at the disposal of the Bank Melli Iran. Another part of this purchased gold has been used to replace the gold bars of varied fineness formerly melted and cast in Tehran. These bars have been used for the coinage ol Pahlavis and offered for sale at the free market rates. In addition to the above indicated quantities, the Ministry of f inance has also acquired and imported from America a certain amount of gold. The sale of this gold, as well as that sold by the Bank Melli Iran and the Imperial Bank of Iran for account of the British Embassy, either in the form of small bars or gold Sovereigns and Pahlavis, has helped a great deal the withdrawal of bank-notes. 1 he sales of gold and silver effected by the two Banks from 28 Khordad to 4 Esfand 1322 (19 June 1943 to 24 Eebruary 1944) amounted to about 400 million rials. In this way the Bank Melli Iran has been able to convert into gold up to this date, at the legal rate, the equivalent of Rls. 210,980.000 of the silver reserve and, at the same time, to withdraw considerable amouts of notes from circulation by effecting sales of gold and silver on the Tehran free market. Ordered from South Africa Remainder^ 1,500.000 - arrived in Tehran 500,000 ready for sh ipinen t Ordered from Moscow 500.000 - arrived in Tehran $ 12 , 020.000 500.000 $ 7,516,000Apart from the gold and silver sold within the country, the Bank Melh Iran has sold to the Government of India 50u tons of fine silver. The ^ largest part of this transaction has been effected on the basis of the Tehran Vmarkct price ol silver (namely 750 rials per kilogram of silver 000 fine) which is about two times the official London and New York quotations. By so doing the Bank Melli Iran not only has succeeded in converting into gold part of the silver which would be liable to fluctuations again after (he war, but also secured a considerable profit. I he gold purchased in America has been transported to Tehran by air through the good offices of the American Military authorities, who have been good enough to give full cooperation in this respect. But lately it has become increasingly difficult to use air transport to bring a sufficient quantity of gold to replace the existing stock of silver. Nor is it expedient to effect shipments by sea owing to the high rates of insurance and transport. Seeing that part of the gold reserve is in fact deposited in South Africa, there seems to be no reason why some of the gold should not likewise re main on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to be later transported to Tehran on more favorable terms. In this way gold acquired and deposited in America would be con sidered as part of the reserve, and an equivalent amount of silver would thus be released . A project of law is being prepared in this connection and will be presented for the approval of the Majless shortly. During the month of Bahman arrangements were completed with the Bank Melli Iran for an initial coinage order of approximately Bis. 10,000,000 of one, two, and five rial pieces. Active operations were commenced late in the month, with deliveries to start early in Esfand in daily quantities of about 50.000 one-rial, 30,000 two-rial and 20,000 five-rial coins. I his is the Mint’s capacity working on a five-hour overtime basis. Deliveries have since commenced, and the new coinage has been eargerly absorbed by the public. Completion of the present order will require approximately two months, and it is the Bank’s intention to place similar orders as rapidly as possible. Smooth execution of these orders will depend on our ability to obtain locally the necessary crucibles until our continued efforts to obtain a satisfactory supply from India or England are successful.Customs Revenue The information that follows is reported by Mr. Gresham, Adminis trator-General of Customs. The month of Dey is the latest period for which we have statistics available showing the customs revenues collected and the value of exports and imports, and the extent of other ( ustoms operations. Statistics are also available for the total of the various operations for the first ten months of the current year. The total Customs revenue collected during the month of Dey amounts to somewhat more than thirty millions of rials and exceded the collections during the corresponding month of 1321 by approximately four millions of rials. The total revenue collected during the first ten months has amounted to 374- millions as compared with 499 millions of rials for the corresponding period of 1321. An inspection of the breakdown of these fign res in the table below discloses that the decline in the amount of the revenue as Compared wdth the previous year has been mainly on account of the severe restrictions on the volume of the imports of tea and sugar. Although there has been no change in the rates of duties and other charges, the amount of revenue on imports of tea and sugar has declined by over 100 millions of rials. As a matter of fact, it may be noted that some 107 millions of the total decline of 123 millions in the Customs revenue is ac counted for by tea and sugar. It is noteworthy that the amount of customs duties on 'other goods for the first ten months was only a little more than six millions under the figure for 1321, and this decline was largely in consequence ol the smaller volume of imports of cotton piece goods. Customs Revenues for Dey and First Ten Months of 1322 and 1321 (in thousands of rials) Sources of revenues Dey First ten months 1322 1321 1322 1321 Import duty on sugar 3,182 2,985 49.934 101,833 Import duty on other goods 8.711 7,034 96,313 102,642 Road tax 2,847 2,566 37.023 46,556 Monopoly tax on tea and sugar 3,165 3,023 49.497 105,055 Port and sanitary dues 171 21 1.125 897 Export tax (4°/,,) on lamb skins 30 368 576 Other revenues 12.271 10,712 139,771 141,811 Total 30,377 26,341 374,031 499,370Because the statistics of exports of petroleum products are not pu blished it is not possible to give the amount and trend of total export trade. However, it may be stated that the value of export of commercial goods ^■during the month of Dey surpassed the amount for the preceding year by over lb million rials, and the total for the first ten months of the current year was over 20 percent higher than the value of exports for the corre sponding month in 1321. I he higher value was the result of larger quanti ties. With reference to the value of total exports, it may be stated that the amount for the current year greatly exceeds 1321. The value of imports of goods on which Customs duties were collec ted, during the month of Dey, was higher by 72 percent than the value of the corresponding imports in 1321. But the value of this class of imports during the first ten months was only about 2 percent higher than for the corresponding period of last year. I he volume of imports was of course lower, as is indicated by the fact that (he amount of Customs duties collec ted, which are based mainly on quantities, were substantially less on this classification of imports..

A number of Commissions have been held with repre sentatives of the Bank Melli, the Ministry of 1' oreign Affairs, and the Office for the Protection of Foreigners Property, and it is believed that solutions have been found for the difficulties, and that these goods may soon be avail able to satisfy important needs of the Iranian economy. The Customs Administration has cooperated to a large extent andeffectively with the Movements Office of the Section of Price Stabilization in connection with the railway transport of government and ( ivil goods from Southern ports to lehran. The statistics of this operation have been reported by the Section of Price Stabilization, but the effects of it ha\ ( not received much attention, from the C ustoms point of view it lias lesulted in clearing up a condition of congestion in the warehouses of the Southern customs and the release of a large volume of goods which had remained static for many months, dhis movement has had a definitely favorable effect on the prices of commodities in 1 ehran, including substantial!v lower prices for a number of important commodities. Although not a normal customs operation, mention should be made that the Customs Administration has supervised the assembly of a shipment of Dodge trucks at Ahwaz, and has actively participated in the search for a part of the shipment which become lost during the last year. In conse quence, most of the missing parts have been located and shipped to Tehran, where the work of assembly is expected to be completed in the near future. The thirty trucks assembled at Ahwaz are in operation, and it is expected that at least thirty more will be completed from the original shipment of eighty-six. In consequence of the relatively small volume of total foreign trade during the past two years, some of the ( ustoms warehouses have been emp ty, and others have not been used to capacity, although at some places storage space has been inadequate. In such circumstances it is only proper that the Customs Administration should have cooperated to satisfy other urgent demands, such as those of the former Ministry of Food for space for the central bakery, those of the Ministry of War for storage of grain, and those of the foreign military authorities for assistance in the temporary sto rage and protection of some of the goods being sent in transit through Iran to the Soviet Union. Many problems have been presented, and some friction has occurred as a result of the suddenness and urgency of some of these demands. Although some of the details remain to be worked out, almost all of the difficulties have been removed, and the situation at the present time is not far from being entirely satisfactory, taking in view the circums tances. I he warehouses at khorramshahr which were taken last year by the military authorities to assist in the protection of perishable goods during the rainy season have been returned to Customs use, and in consequencethe condition ol serious congestion which has prevailed during the past has now been relieved. The military authorities have cooperated in a number ^of other ways toward the re-establishment of normal control and supervi- ^sion by the Customs of all Government and other civil goods entering sou thern ports. Some improvements have been achieved in connection with the hand ling and protection of government and civil cargo from ship to Customs warehouses and during movement between ports in the Persian Gulf. But ihc handling and security ol cargo in that area is still lar Irom satisfac tory, and it is hoped that the responsible authorities will cooperate effec tively in the accomplishment of further improvements. 1 he ( ustoms Administration is seriously handicapped bv lack of ade- &lt;|uato facilities foi frontier control and assistance in policing and enforce- mi nt activities. ( onsiderable motor transport is necessary, and additional sub-offices and posts must be established, especially along new routes across the frontiers which have been opened by the military authorities or which have otherwise developed during the recent past. A further serious difficulty arises from the attitude of aggressive dis regard of Customs authority which is shown by the civil population and the persistent refusal of some of the foreign authorities either to cooperate in working out a program which provides for customs supervision or to take effective measures themselves to prevent others from taking advantage of their operations to evade Customs authority. There is evidence of some change of attitude in this respect, and in some areas definite improvement has occurred. But it is to be hoped that the issue may soon be faced square ly ami a program worked out that will effectively eliminate the condi tions of widespread disregard of Customs authority and even of bold and large-scale smuggling. Internal Revenues I he work of (he Internal Revenue Administration has gone forward in a more or less satisfactory manner. Steps were taken to organize two additional Appeal Commissions. Hundreds of cases await hearing, and it is hoped that this measure will assist in clearing up the arrears of income taxes. The regulations to govern the new income tax law were prepared and are being submitted to the Direct Taxation Department for its study asfast as they can be translated. Forms for use witii the new law have also been prepared. Statistics are still in an unsatisfactory condition, and tables used in^ this report should be considered as indicative rather than accurate. The work of the Indirect Taxation Department continued to show improvement. The large increase in excise collections is accounted for by a large payment on account of last month, and collections for Esfand in all probability will not reach the Rls. 6,254,556.45 shown for Dey.

Budget of the Government Progress was made during the month under report in the preparation of the Government budget; but the budgets of the various ministries and administrations have not all been submitted, it is therefore impossible to study the budgets with a view to determining which items of expenditure should be included, which should be reduced, and which must be elimi nated. Attention has been given in a general way to the proposals of sever al ministries. Because of the serious financial situation ol the Go\einment, it is our intention to scrutinize with extreme care the estimates both of receipts and expenditures, and, accordingly, 1 have relrained from promis ing any increase to any ministry. On the basis of the demands alieady made, it appears that, in order to balance the budget, a total amount of about two billion rials will have to be deducted from the estimated ex penditures of the ministries. General Policies and Activities - Financial and Economic Your Excellency is fully aware that economic conditions have a vital bearing on the financial situation and that financial policies are an impor tant factor in creating economic conditions. Ihe two must be studied and handled together, and it has been gratifying to me since my return to Iran to find the Government and Majless willing to take comprehensive and constructive action in the various parts of the financial and economic fields. Onlv b\ such action can the different conditions and forces be kept under control and in balance and reasonable stability attained. In spite of the extraordinary height to which prices had risen, the impossibility ol stop ping this rise at once, and the other complications that we have encoun tered and the difficulties through which we have passed, it seems to me that the Government and Parliament have reason to feel some satisfaction in the results achieved and some confidence in the future. It may be of interest in this connection to set forth in this place the course of prices in Iran, as shown by the general price index prepared in19 — V' the Bank Mclli. 1 lie index figures are given below: 1315 100.- 1310 121.1 1317 132.5 1318 142.7 1319 161.9 Esfand 1320 314.- Esfand 1321 778.3 Ear vard in 1322 945.- Ordibehesht 1322 910.- Khordad 1322 874.- Tir 1322 917.- Mordad 1322 980.- Shahrivar 1322 993.- Mehr 1322 1031.- Aban 1322 1(K)8.- Azar 1322 1076.- Dey 1322 1073.- I hese figures show that no sueli rise in prices occurred in 1322 as occurred in 1320 and 1321. In the months of Ordibehesht and Khordad, prices actually declined. During the months of Mehr, Aban, Azar and Dey, prices were relatively stable. It is true that all prices have not behaved in ihe same manner. Some have sharply risen and continue to rise. Olliers have changed only slightly or have fallen. The recent more favorable trend is due both to outside conditions and to the policies and activities of the Iranian Government. It is evident, however, that, as the end of the war approaches, the process of inflation will give way to deflationary influences and trends. We must now look forward to and plan for that difficult period, and we are already proposing and taking action designed to cope with post-war condi tions. We shall be faced at that time with decreased revenues, with large debts contracted at inflated prices, with a swollen budget, with an unem ployment problem, and with a multitude of matters arising from the with drawal of the Allied forces. One aspect of policy seems to me to be quite clear: we can and must, during the coming year, check the increase of governmental spending, and stop the accumulation of debt.« — 20 — Commercial and Industrial Operations The commercial and industrial enterprises constitute an exceedingly important factor in governmental finance and in economic stabilization. These enterprises include the several monopolies that are wholly under our'* supervision and control - grain, bread, rice, tobacco and opium - and those that are more or less under our control, such as sugar, tea, and cotton piecegoods. With reference to the latter commodities, certain responsibilities rest also on the Ministries of Commerce and Industries, and of Agriculture. In addition to the monopolies, there are the various factories and mines that are owned and operated by the Government. These are under the direct administration of the Ministry of Commerce and industries; but we have important powers and duties in connection with them; for example, with respect to budgets, expenditures, accounting, salaries, wages, prices, quotas, requirements and procurement of equipment, and distribution of pro ducts. These powers and duties are exercised largely through the Adminis tration of Industrial Supervision, and partly also through the Sections of Price Stabilization and Distribution. The Ministry of Agriculture is also involved in the operations of some of the factories; and the Ministry of W ar is concerned with the administration of the munitions factories. The railroad is under the Ministry of Roads, except for the financial control exercised by the Ministry of Finance. The truck-transport monopoly is administered under my super vision by the Road Transport Administration. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance, through the Administration of Internal Revenue and the Treasury- General. exercises supervision over certain companies that the Government owns, wholly or partly, or in which it has a financial interest. Finally, the Administration of Ceded Properties, Public Domains, and Exploitation, of the Ministry of Finance, has within its jurisdiction the Government hotels and a few industrial enterprises. I he problems of organization and administration presented by these industrial and commercial undertakings are enormously difficult; and can not be solved in haste or without most careful consideration. A fundamental question is whether some or all of the Government- owned enterprises should not be transferred wholly or partly to private ownership. I hose that are to be operated by the Government should be or ganized and administered in such a way as to be. whenever possible, finan cially self-sustaining and economically justifiable. W e have recently effected certain reorganizations in the Ministry of— 21 Finance and in its connected organizations so that our own operations may he more efficiently conducted. We have in view some more reorganizations which will he proposed to Your Excellency for the approval of the (iovern- ^ ment or put into effect under the Law of 13 Ordibehesht 1322. 1 he steps that we have taken during the last two months have resulted in marked improvements. Particularly gratifying has been the speedy perfecting of arrangements for the immediate transfer of goods from the factories and warehouses of the Ministry of Commerce and Industries. These goods will he distributed as rapidly as possible through our Section of Distribution. Factories and Mines The Administration of Industrial Supervision, under the direction of Mr. Vivian, has taken various steps to increase or develop production in certain units and to reduce expenditures in others. Arrangements have been made to place Tehran Factory No. 5 (Cas Mask Factory) on a profitable basis. This plant is able to produce a great variety of miscellaneous items such as metal buttons, shoe plates, sewing of cloth into uniforms, harness and shoe sewing, et cetera. I he Iranian Army and Gendarmerie officials have tentatively agreed to have their work done in this plant. Considerable information has been accumulated with regard to mar kets for products from the Sodium ( arbonate Plant, the Refractory C lay Mine and the Refractory Brick Plant, and it is anticipated that these plants can he put on a paying basis. Meetings have been held dealing with the requirements lor the ( e- ment Plant, the Sugar Refineries and the Parchin (powder) 1'actory. Agree ment has been reached on the requirements for the Parchin factory and the Cement Plant. The Sugar Refineries are still under discussion. Some progress can be reported on the disposition of the products from the Bandar-Abbas fish Canning factory, the Soap factory and the Textile Mills. After thorough investigation and consideration of all proven factors, the following 1323 budget cuts have been recommended: 1) Zanjan Copper Mine Rls. 25,000,000 2) Hormoz Red Oxide Mine 2,300,000 3) Yeramin Oil Extraction Plant 226,971,840 Total Rls. 254,271,840,—In addition we have recommended that the Shaliabad Sugar Refinery be closed lor the coming year. 1 his plant produced b51 tons ol refined sugar in 1322 at a cost in excess of Rls. 30.00 per kilogram or a total operating cost of Rls. 13,943,923. Also it has been found possible to process the projected 1323 beet crop without opening the ^ eramin Refinery, which would have necessitated an expenditure of Rls. 23,000,000. Obviously, the operating cost for 1^23 is also unnecessary. This saving to the 1323 budget represents a total amount of Rls. 293,215,763. It may be contended that this is not a saving, but rather re presents a loss, since the plants would produce revenue in excess of ex penditures. But, except for the Shahabad Refinery, the units have not pro duced revenue in recent years and some never have done so. I he total, ex cept for a small sum necessary for guarding the \ eramin Oil Plant, does represent an amount saved in the budget. For several reasons, the munitions factories have been a special pro blem. In this connection, we have been plagued by the scattering of res ponsibility among three ministries - Commerce and Industries, War, and Finance. I have been in complete agreement with the Iranian Government that Iran, so far as lies within its resources and its power, should assist its Al lies. No one has more admiration than 1 for the tremendous effort and the splendid achievements of the Soviet Union in this war. 1 have had no desire or intention at any time to place obstacles in the way of any undertaking that might be of military assistance to the Soviet Union. On the other hand, an agreement exists for the operation of the mu nitions factories; and it was represented to me that it was the intention of those who signed the agreement that the expenses of the munitions factories would be covered by the sale of the products. It was not, 1 understand, at any time the intention that the production of munitions should be subsidized by the Iranian Government. On this understanding, therefore, the factories were authorized some months ago to pay their expenses from the receipts. The agreement referred to provides that the prices of munitions de livered shall be fixed by mutual agreement. Certain raw materials have been supplied by the Soviet authorities; and the prices of these materials should also be fixed by mutual agreement. Up to this date, these prices have notm—mmm m — 23 been fixed. Because of this failure, for which l have not been in any way responsible, and also because of the confusion of the accounts of the factory, , we have had no basis for determining the financial requirements of the munitions factories. In view of our great financial difficulties, and in view of the impending shortage at times of rial notes, which has threatened the food supply of Tehran, we have been fully justified in expecting that the munitions factories would operate on Iheir receipts or on advances made by the Soviet authorities. Distribution of Monopoly Goods The distribution of monopoly goods - sugar, tea and cotton piece - goods - involves (1) the determination of requirements; (2) the procurement of the goods; (3) rationing; (4) transportation to the distribution points; and (5) the actual distribution to the people. In all of these operations, progress is being made. The central Government Store at Tehran was opened to Government employees on 5 Bahman 1322. Sales increased rapidly alter the lirst few days, and it is believed that, as new personnel is trained and new lines of merchandise are added, the store will become progressively important as a means of placing a larger volume of goods in the hands of the local populace at reason able prices. The following are figures covering the operation of b.c store during the month of Bahman : In meters In rials Total cloth at the opening 1,712,728.00 32,663,164.00 Total cloth sold during the month 163,892.00 5,315.907.00 Balance at the end of the month 1,548,836.00 27,347,257.00 Mr. Ferguson, Chief Administrator of the Distribution Section, sup plies also the following information concerning the transportation ol monop oly goods in the month of Bahman.To Transportation of Cotton Pieeegoods From By Rail: 180 tons Tehran khorramshahr 4 tons (iorgan Tehran 6 tons Sari Tehran 190 tons Total By Road: Nil Consignments of Tea To From By Rail : 449 tons Tehran khorramshahr 6 tons A rak Tehran 455 tons Total By Road: 4 tons Tehran Resht (subject to T.B.R. confirmation 4 tons Total Despatches of Sugar To From By Rail ; 360 tons Kazvin khorramshahr 200 tons Sari khorramshahr 1.500 tons Tehran khorramshahr 700 tons Qnm ( for khorramshahr Isfahan ) 171 tons Bandar Shah Shahzand (lor (iorgan ) 16 tons Shahrud 1 eh ran 33 tons Semnan Tehran 50 tons (iorgan Tehran 66 tons Sari Tehran 16 tons Tiruzkooh (Sari) Tehran 3,112 tons Total By Road : 924 tons Tehran kahrizak 30 tons Sari Tehran 52 tons Resht Tehran 1.006 tons Total~ — 27 — I he arrivals of grain in 1 ehran ibis month have continued very stea dily, although the total is less than the preceding months due partly to ^the fact that the more easily accessible grain had already been moved, and * partly to the fact that winter weather has made transport a more difficult problem, In spite of these difficulties, the stock of grain in Tehran has slightly increased, to the following quantities: Wheat and wheat flour 6,467 W hite flour 1,257 Barley 8,762 Other adulterants 2,326 \\ e are indebted this month to the British Army transport of grain from Hamadan and Kermanshah and also to the United Kingdom (Commer cial Corporation for part of the grain left in Khorassan. A slightly larger number of 1. Ct. Pool trucks has also been used in grain collection this month, as shown in the following table: Arrivals of Grain in Tehran.

Nevertheless, the quahty of the bread. leaves much to be desired. This unfortunate situation may be b. -m - tent the fault of the bakers, but in large part it is due to the 1 ‘ Y „f the flour delivered by the Silo to the bakeries, the Silo is under Cereals and Bread Section. That Section reports that the gram arriving ... Tehran contains dirt and impurities. Moreover, no new spare parts havey t been received for ihe Silo mill. Nevertheless, improvement has been made in the quality of Hour produced in Tehran. Greater care has been taken in the hand cleaning of barley. Adjustments have been made in the machinery of the mill. The sieves, which were old and torn, have large &gt; &gt; c &lt; » 1 ced; and machinery, which has been prepared for redressing the barley l our, removes most of the husks and some of the grit. A new wheat washing machine has been prepared, so that all the wheat flour now produced will be cleaner and of a better and more uniform quality. Arrangemen s ar being made to obtain machinery to remove all the stones from .he barley before grinding. Rice Under (he direction of Mr. Assadi, the work of collecting and deliv ering rice has proceeded with results that are, on the whole, gratifying. Our first purpose has been, of course, the fulfillment of our contract with the Soviet authorities. In spite of very serious difficulties, this purpose has been, in the main, achieved. At the end of Bahman, over 13,000 tons had been delivered, and about 2,000 tons were ready for delivery. Almost 1 f000 tons were held in Government and Company warehouses; and about 2,400 tons had been transported to Tehran. The total purchases were about 32,000 ions. Transportation Under tlie direction of Mr. Shields and his associates graiif) ing P 10 gress is being made in the improvement of truck transportation. Overhaul and repair facilities for Government-owned lorries and au tomobiles have been totally inadequate; and the Road transport Adminis tration will be seriously handicapped until proper and adequate mainte nance facilities can be provided. Studies are being made to ascertain ourneeds in the immediate future for additional equipment, parts, repair faci lities, and essential supplies. An analysis of the existing over-the-road operations revealed the need for setting up planned and controlled operations along the line of proved practices, so as to provide a more regular service and a more even distri bution of transportation throughout the country. To reduce the handicap of limited communication facilities and to provide proper control, it has been decided to establish five branch offices at strategic points, each having res ponsibility for the conduct of operations within its zone or area and for the conduct of operations between areas in accordance with a master plan. The general office and field administration was found to be quite ineffective, and the accounting practices most inadequate. Considerable •change has already been made, and more revision is anticipated. Waybills presented to the Tehran office for payment to contractors during the month of Bahman totalled 9,294,863 ton-kilometers, of which 8,141,146 were loaded and 1.154.717 were empty ton-kilometers. 1 he loaded ton-kilometers shown by the waybills reflect an increase of 1,211,477 over the month of Dcy. A detailed statement of performance by contractors fol lows. As pointed out in our previous report, the results shown do not ne- cecessarily reflect actual performance. We are planning to place our new' method of compiling such statistics in effect on the first of T arvardin next. Statistics of tonnage carried by l.C. Pool lorries are also expected to be available beginning the first of next year.Following is a statement showing ihe allocation of I. G. Pool lorries at 11 Esfand 1322. Distribution of I. G.

Ihis figure should be compared with the 9,000 tons which we planned. In general, we feel that real progress is being made in the movement of goods. Such progress is, of course, an essential part of the program of distribution and price stabilization.Irregularities, Misappropriations and Crimes All right-thinking Iranians are seriously concerned about the corrup tion that has existed and still exists in connection with the commercial^ operations of the Government. The Government has suffered and is still suffering enormous losses: but the people are probably the chiei sufferers. While 1 am certain that corruption has diminished in the enterprises under the supervision of the American Mission, the situation is still bad enough to cause the gravest concern. Your Excellency is aware, of course, that dishonesty is not confined to our officials. It exists to a serious extent in all of the administrations of the Government, but, of course, it is most noticeable where opportunities are to be found in the handling of large sums of money and valuable goods.. It is also true that the dishonest employees of the Government are aided and abetted by some dishonest merchants, certain dishonest landlords, and other persons. Finally we must recognize the fact that, in many instances, dishonest officials of other Ministries have combined with our officials and have thus aggravated the situation and made it more dillicult lor us to deal with. 1 desire to make it clear also that I do not believe that all of our officials are dishonest. Many of our Iranian officials are men of the highest integrity, and I am proud to be associated with them. Various measures must be used to combat the prevailing corruption^ Among these measures let me emphasize the following: the stabilization of prices; the raising of the salaries of the employees; the recognition and pro motion of honest employees; the installation of proper accounting and other controls; and the establishment of good organization and good administration generally. In the execution of regulations and in the enforcement of the res ponsibility of our officials, frequent inspections are absolutely necessary. One of my first acts when I became Administrator General of the Finances was to establish a General Inspection Administration, and l feel that this Administration has become constantly more effective. At this mo ment we have several inspection commissions working in different parts of the country. I am giving the closest attention to their work and note with satisfaction that they arc discovering and cathing thieves and recovering the Government’s money and property. Mr. Zelli, Director - General of that Administration, reports on the— 33 — progress made by inspection commissions in Qum, Kashan, Azerbaijan, Hamadan, Aligudarz and Khorassan. In addition to the General Inspection Administration, we have crea ted specialized inspection services in ihe administrations and sections, no tably in the Road Transport Administration and the Distribution Section. These services arc doing increasingly effective work. Commendable pro gress has been made in the discovery and checking of frauds in connec tion with coupons. An attempt to steal goods from the Government store has been detected and appropriately dealt with. Recently we have had some cases of forgery. The Accounts and Audits Administration bears the major responsi bility for preventing and uncovering financial irregularities. The system that has been in operation in the Iranian Government is inadequate to insure either proper and prompt accounting or effective auditing. Improve ment in this connection is being made. The Accounts and Audits Administration reports the following lour examples of irregularities discovered during Bahman; one in the Glycerine Factory, where the General Inspection Administration is making investiga tions; one in the Cereals and Bread Section, where a check without sup porting documents was issued for approximately (&gt;00.000 rials; one in the Ministry of Justice, where a sum of approximately 170,000 rials was im properly disbursed; and one in the Ministry of M ar, where a large sum had been advanced to a contractor for the delivery of rice. Ihe rice was not delivered, and the letter of guarantee given by the contractor was found to be forged. Our inspectors are seriously handicapped by the lack of automobiles. We have honest and zealous financial agents, but in some cases they are practically unable to visit their sub - agencies. In Yazd, for ex ample, the financial agency has no automobile that is capable of being used. In my opinion, a major means of eliminating dishonesty is to have an American Finance Director in each of the provinces. In the two provinces where Americans are now stationed, the results have already been gratifying. Du- ' ring the last month. Mr. Wiens at Isfahan, ably assisted by Iranian officials, has uncovered a considerable amount of thievery at Nadjafabad and has recovered large sums of stolen money. American finance Directors, with their own inspection forces, can exercise a more constant control and am — 34 — more vigilant supervision than we can in the ( enter: and they can do so without the necessity of sending automobiles on long trips out of lehran. Because of the incalculable advantage of decentralizing inspection and su-y^ pervision, I have been deeply disappointed over the delay in obtaining fa cilities for Mr. Gordon to proceed to his post at Meshed. ] his delay is caus ing irreparable losses to the Government and to the people of Khorassan. As soon as an irregularity is discovered, we do everything within our power (1) lo punish the guilty person or persons; (2) to recover any losses suffered by the Government; and (3) to establish safeguards against the oc currence of irregularities in the future. But, while we shall do everything within our power, it must be understood that adequate and effective action against wrongdoers depends on the cooperation of the police, the prosecu- ^ tors, and the courts. These agencies should not interfere or participate in our inspections, unless invited to do so, because our inspectors must un derstand their responsibility. Joint inspections result in delay and division of responsibility. On the other hand, when we have made our inspections and gathered evidence, we expect the Ministry ol Justice to proceed prompt ly and vigorously with the prosecution and trial of the accused persons. I am confident that in this respect we shall receive the full cooperation of the Ministry of Justice. Since the arrival of Mr. Brownrigg about two months ago and his appointment as Director-General of the Personnel Administration, praise worthy progress has been made in bringing the work of that Administration up to date, in Ihe disposal of troublesome cases, and in the planning of new projects and procedures. Two months ago, the Pension Department had an accumulation of about 12,000 cases awaiting action. These have now been disposed of. Various matters that resulted in the delayed payment or non payment of employees have been attended to. As this work continues, we may look forward to more just treatment of the Government personnel and to less dissatisfaction on their part. The Personnel Administration is also making a detailed study of the Civil Service Law and of other personnel laws and regulations, and a project for a new Civil Service Law is in course of preparation. I am glad to record the recent arrival and assignments of the follow ing Americans: Mr. Monroe Keass and Mr. James V. Lang, Price Stabiliza tion Section; and Mr. Albert J. Angell, Jr., Road I ransport Administration. Mr. Melville Monk has been appointed Director-General of the InternalRevenue Administration, and Mr. William S. Nancarrow, Provincial Finance Director of Guilan. Mr. F. Kenerson Johnston has been transferred from the Distribution Section to the Price Stabilization Section. We have wel comed the coming of Mr. Harvey Stokely, who has been appointed by the Ministries of Health and Finance to the position of Director of the Pharm aceutical Institute. In conclusion, let me convey to ^ our Excellency the renewed assu rances of my most distinguished consideration. A. €.

Your Excellency: 1 have the honor to submit herewith my report for the month ol Dey, 1322 (December 23,1943-January 21. 1944). The aetivitiei. of the Ar'erican Mission fall into two divisions, the economic and the financial. Although these two divisions are in practice closely connected and dependent on each other. 1 shall report first on the economic field. Grain Collection The Cereals and Bread Section reports that, in spite of difficulties created by the advent of winter weather, the total collections in Dey were satisfactory. If the same rate of collection continues lor two more months, the grain stocks will be more than enough to carry through the remainder of the year to the next harvest. Tile amount of new commitments secured during the month was only 3,64b tons, but it will be taken in mind that most of the grain had previously been contracted for. It is of special interest to note that the total commitments taken so far this year for grain delivery have surpassed the maximum original target figure of 328,500 tons. The Cereals and Bread Section may be congratulatedf n S pite of a reduction in transport and the normal difficulties caused by winter weather, enough cereals were transported to Tehran in Dey to supply all the local requirements and increase the local silo reserve stock by 1,469 tons. The stock at Tehran was as follows: 7,458 tons wheat^ and wheat flour, 8,194 tons barley and 2,317 tons of other adulterants. The comparative statement of monthly arrivals of grain in Tehran is given below: Monthly Arrivals of Grain in Tehran. Figures in tons, 2/3 wheat and 1/3 barley.

During the month under report, the Bread Administration accounts were completed for the year 1321, and the accounts for both the Central Bakery and the Bread Administration will be completed up to the time that these departments were separated from the Cereals and Bread Section. f ~The Bread of Tehran. During the month of Dey the bread situation in Tehran presented no critical problems. Much credit is due to Colonel Saffari for the marked improvement that has taken place: better inspections, better enforcement, decreasing deliveries, and less crowding at the bake-shops. A number of workmen of the Central Bakery were dismissed because of lack of need for their services. They were dealt with fairly, and, it is believed, have no reasonable ground for complaint. Procurement. Through the appointment of Mr. C. Irving Hansen as Administrator of the Procurement Division of the Price Stabilization Section, the impor tant work of filling the country’s requirements has been placed in capable hands. Mr. Hansen has also been appointed Director-General of the State General Supply Corporation, thus joining under one direction all of the procurement activities of the Government. Distribution of Monopoly Goods. The distribution of monopoly goods in the past has been thoroughly bad and a cause of justified popular complaint. It is our desire and intention to establish throughout Iran the best possible organization for the distribution of cotton piece-goods, sugar and tea, and to see that such goods are distributed quickly, honestly and fairly to all the people and particularly to the villagers and tribesmen. The \ needs of the villagers and tribesmen are to be given first and most urgent \ consideration. Instructions are being issued designed to achieve these purposes; and it is our hope that we can report in succeeding months a steadily increas ing and broadening distribution of essential commodities. Linder the direction of Mr. Ferguson, the rationing system has been placed on a more satisfactory basis. In the Division of Rationing, steps have been taken to obtain basic information, and a statistics and records unit has been set up. Other organizational changes have been made. Oper ations during the month of Dey involved the distribution of bread cou pons, the preparation and distribution of ration books to Government employees, and preparations for the printing and distribution of ration books to become valid at the beginning of 1323.For the first time we have been able to obtain a tabulation of the number of bread coupons distributed to the public. I he number was 776.089. Coupons numbering 9.005 were lost during the operation. This loss was largely due to the change in operations. Preparations were made for^v a more orderly and better distribution of bread coupons in Bahman. Preparations for the distribution of employee ration books went along smoothly. At the end of Dey 5,200 books had been issued to emplo yees. It is expected that around 60,000 books will be issued to Government employees in Tehran. Some irregularities have occurred, due to the fact that we must rely on the Personnel Offices of the various ministries to certify the number of dependents. Neither we nor the Personnel Offices yet have had time to make a thorough check. Ration books for the country have been prepared and are being printed. Steps have been taken to establish the best possible organization for distribution both in Tehran and the provinces. We do not expect to distribute ration books to villages or tribes. Nevertheless, the total number of ration books will be around 8,000,000. Distribution of the books presents an urgent and pressing problem, and every effort is being made to solve it. Those in charge of rationing expect in future reports to give a more detailed statistical statement of rationing activities. It will be evident from the above statements that we are keeping in mind the needs of the provinces. Distribution in Ghom has improved; Mr. Solomon, Finance Director of Khuzistan, reports that he is distributing monopoly goods to the tribes of Khuzistan for the first time in their history; distribution has been resumed at Zahedan; authorization was given to sup ply goods to the Purkomans in northern Khorassan; and Mr. Ostovan, returning to Gorgan, has been made responsible for distributing goods as soon as possible in Gorgan. The Government store in Tehran is now open and doing daily a substantial volume of business, with a favorable effect on general prices in Tehran. Now that this long-hoped-for result has been achieved, I desire to give commendation to all who have contributed toils accomplishment: Mr. Robinson, formerly Chief Administrator of Price Stabilization;^ Mr. Lamb; Mr. Ferguson; Mr. Johnston; their Iranian assistants, and all others who in one way or another have cooperated in this notable undertaking. Some confusion existed for a time relative to the quantities of sugarto be distributed; and, through error, the sugar ration was increased in Isfahan, Ghom and Tehran to 1,000 grams, while the ration in the rest of the country remained generally at 400 grams. A circular instruction has - v ~'»en issued fixing the Rahman ration for the entire country outside of Tehran at 400 grams. The ration for Tehran will be reduced to 500 grams in Farvardin. Our policy is, first, to maintain a uniform ration throughout the country. This policy is dictated by considerations of justice. Our pur pose is, second, to increase this uniform ration as soon as possible to at least 500 grams. This increase will be made as soon as we have completed an inventory of existing stocks, are assured that supplies will be adequate in future months, and have under way a wider distribution to the \illageis and tribesmen. I trust that, in those places where the ration has been in creased and then reduced, the people will understand that sugar is a rationed commodity, that we must treat all the people of Iran alike, and that we are compelled to adjust the ration to the supplies that are and will be available. I have established by regulation a Committee on Rations and Prices, under the chairmanship of Mr. Lamb, Chief Administrator of Price Stabili zation, to make studies and submit recommendations on proposed changes in rations and prices. A regulation has been issued establishing a Section of Distribution, which will include the Divisions of Distribution, Rationing, and Transpor tation, formerly in the Price Stabilization Section. This action is believed to be sound from the standpoint of organization and is expected to contri bute to efficient administration, since there is no necessary administrative connection between the activities of the new Section and those that re main with the Price Stabilization Section. Mr. Lamb, C hief Administrator of Price Stabilization, will incidentally be free to devote more of his time to various exceedingly important problems in his field which call for ur gent attention and on which he has already made significant contributions. The new Section of Distribution has been placed in charge of Mr. Ferguson. Transportation During the month of Dey, Mr. Shields, Director-General of the Road Transport Administration, and Messrs. Hurst, Breitenbach and Weltonofhis staff took up their duties, I heir activities thus far have necessarily been con centrated on the development of a program designed to obtain the most_ 8 efficient use of the transport facilities available in the country. The plan is substantially complete, and marked improvement may be expected in the near future. Since their arrival, certain machinery has been brought to Teh ran from Fariman. ^ The following table shows the latest reported disposition of Iranian Government trucks: 1 Distribution of l. G.

Loaded ton-kilometres £ftr the month of Dey totalled 5,677,975, compared with 6,334,782 ton - kilo- ,.*etres in Azar, a decrease of 656,807 ton-kilometres. There was a decrease in empty ton-kilometres of 2,121,206, compared with the previous month, which indicates that truck miles were more efficiently used. A detailed statement of the ton-kilometrage for Dey follows, but it should be pointed out that, by reason of the method used in compiling these statistics, the results shown do not necessarily reflect the actual tonnage moved during the month. First, there is frequently considerable delay on the part of the contractors in presenting the waybills from which the data are produced, and there is therefore no assurance that the bills presented actually cover movements of goods during the month indicated. Second, the tonnage is generally computed on the capacity of the truck, rather than the actual weight of the goods transported. Steps are being taken to obtain more informative records from which more accurate data concerning movements of goods during given periods for comparative purposes to reflect results will be available.During the past few months, the Iranian Government has had, in connection witli transportation, two serious problems: one concerned with the transportation of goods, and the other with the transportation of Go- /^vernment officials and employees. It is evident that the internal organiza tion and operations of the Road Transport Administration are improving. Steps are also being taken to improve the transportation situation by means of certain reorganizations. I am taking steps to transfer the custody, operation and maintenance of Government automobiles from the State General Supply Corporation to the Road transport Administra tion. Although we shall make every effort to obtain an adequate supply of automobiles, spare parts and tires for the needs of the Government, it is certain that, during the coming year, we shall be faced with a serious shortage of these essential materials. It is necessary, therefore, that the existing equipment should be kept in the best possible repair. It is also the duty of every official and employee who has the use of a Government automobile to take good care of it and of its tires. In the past, both cars and tires have been misused. The situation with regard to both trucks and automobiles requires: a) That every vehicle when sent on a trip should be utilized to its full capacity; and b) That our vehicles should be used for essential purposes. In order to assist in utilizing trucks and automobiles to the best ad vantage, a Transport Priorities Office has been established; and Mr. Schuck- man has been appointed its Director. The duties of this Office are set forth in Transportation Regulation No. 119/6, dated 15 Rahman, 1322. This Office is to receive all applications, with certain exceptions, for the use of trucks, railway space, and automobiles. It will approve or reject such applications and establish priorities among the approved applications. The purpose is to make available for the needs of the Government (and so far as possible for the needs of private merchants also) the maximum amount of transportation facilities and to have such facilities available when and where the transportation is needed. In order that the new organization and procedure may work suc cessfully and to the advantage of the entire Government, it is necessary that the various Ministries and independent establishments should cooperate. They are requested to take the following actions, which are referred tommm — • ■ — 12 — in the Regulation and which 1 now wish to bring again to their attention; 1. lo appoint a Movements or Liaison Officer, who will act as the channel of communication with the Transport Priorities Office, and to notify Mr. Schucknian the name of such appointee; ^ 2. To submit all applications for the transportation of goods or pas sengers directly to the Transport Priorities Office or to Mr. Schuckman, not to the Ministry of Finance, the Administrator General of the Finances, or the Road Transport Administration; 3. To give to Mr. Schuckman all the information that he requests, in order that he may determine the essentiality and urgency of the trans portation applied for; and f 4. lo submit forecasts and estimates of transportation needs for a considerable period of time in the future, in order that the Transport Priorities Office and the Road Transport Administration may have an op portunity to plan ahead and make the necessary arrangments. 1 have instructed Mr- Schuckman to give priority (other conditions being equal) to those applications that are received first; and, necessarily, any Ministry or establishment which fails to make an advance estimate of its needs or postpones its application until the last minute is likely to find that no transportation facilities are available for its use.industrial Supervision Mi. Vivian was appointed Director General of Industrial Supervision and look over that position on 21 Dey, 1322. Mr. Harris was appointed his American assistant. Certain other changes in personnel have been made. A number ol industrial establishments have been inspected; budgets are being examined; the problem of workmen's compensation is being studied; and action is being taken on various specific questions. Ceded Properties, Public Domains and Exploitation Mr. Emami, presenting a detailed report, states that plans and regu lations have been prepared for his new organization, and he hopes that, when the new organization is inaugurated, an increase will be shown both in operating efficiency and in income. Internal Revenue Mr. Pixley, Director-General of Internal Revenue, reports that his first objective is to organize the work ol his Administration in a logical manner to permit its (low without interruption. Little progress was made during the month, but studies were continued. 1 he greatest retarding in fluence was the lack of a few well-trained technical men upon whom res- ponsibility could be placed. Another retarding factor was the lack of suitable office space. This will be overcome to some extent when the second floor of the Treasury building is made available. It is also expected that at the end of the year some space will be vacated by the present three-percent tax unit. This will ease the situation further, but does not solve the problem of bringing all of the offices together. The preparation of statistics has continued to receive attention, but has not set resulted in acceptable reports. Comparison with I reasury figures shows a considerable difference in the amounts shown as received by the various Departments and the corresponding accounts of the Treasury. The Treasury is assisting in an effort to find some way of reconciliation of these accounts, at least for the Tehran District. The usual reports of receipts will be included in this report, but it is hoped that the abovetact will be borne in mind. They are an indication; and it is believed that they are prepared with as much accuracy as those of last year with which they are compared. 1 he routine work of the Indirect Taxation Department continued tt/ - ^ go forward satisfactorily. Collections showed an increase over those of last year. I he decline in the collection of bicycle and doroshkeh taxes continued, and efforts to work through the police have not yet produced the desired results. The decline in the tax on alcoholic beverages is due to the fact that a large bill fell due on the last day of the month, Friday, and was received on the first of Bahman. 1 he statement of receipts of this Department in the Tehran District for Dey, 1321 and 1322 follows: Sources of Revenue »ey 1321 Dey 1322 In rials in rials 3 0 / 0 taxes 848,229.45 1,118,305.85 Kerosene and Benzine 9,039,887.— 11,351,303.30 Tax on alcoholic liquors 4,606,176.35 3,626,672.75 Slaughter tax 139,142.90 123,558.50 Forest products 10 0 / 0 21,493.95 66,223.20 Minerals 213,611.55 248,770.70 Mines 5°/o 31,215.10 10,910.40 Horse-drawn carriage 21,594.90 15,952.10 Auction tax 115,465.50 195,568.60 Bicycle 51,630.10 1,576.80 Electricity tax 940,525.90 1,522,545.80 Stamp duties 24,496.— 22,560.— Miscellaneous 526,293.20 684,038.55 Total 16,579,761.90 18,987,986.55 Collections of the Direct taxation Department continue to show a large increase over those of last year. However, there is a large amount of overdue taxes which should be collected. This is our greatest problem at the moment. Another is the setting up of an organization to execute the new Income Tax Faw. Both of these problems are receiving attention, and it is hoped that progress can be reported shortly. Mr. Gordon, appointed Provincial Director of Khorassan but unable to go to his post, was assigned temporarily to this Administration andhas been giving bis full time to the preparation of the new Income Tax Regulations. A statement ol receipts of this Department in the Tehran District ^r the months of Dey, 1321 and 1322 follows: Source* ol Revenue Dey 1321 in rials Dey 1322 in rials Tax on Companies 2,727,337.50 1,134,566.35 Tax on Contractors 1,697,103.60 1,272,133.55 l ax on Salaries 4,313,530.95 10,671,519.00 Differences 76,125.35 77,288.15 Account Department 54,412.85 62,454.45 Tehran Income lax Dept. 1,084,043.90 1,643,884.40 Transport Section 116,925.45 235,826.80 Total 10,069,479.60 15,097,672.70 lhe work of the Concessions, Petroleum and Mine Revenue Depart ment was carried on satisfactorily during the month under review. Steps are being taken in conjunction with the Mines Administration to lease several Government mines. Constant effort is required to prevent the use of Government mines illegally by private persons. Several cases of such illegal use received attention during the month under report. In accordance with its concession the Anglo-lranian Oil Company paid the fourth instalment of the four instalments of royalty for 1322 on December 31, which, plus the gold-premium, amounted to £ 262,500. This sum was carried into account of the advance which the company had paid in Shahrivar on the royalty payments of 1943.V 10 The Treasury Position ^ I regret to say that the figures given in previous reports lor receipts and disbursements have been in part incomplete and should be disregarded. We are doing our utmost to obtain accurate statistics in presentable form, and I hope in my next report to publish tables which will present on a comparative basis the information that the (.overnment and the public require. The figures that are herewith given should be considered approximate. At the end of Azar the ordinary revenues of the Government for the first nine months of 1322 totalled 2,786,000,000 rials. For the corresponding period of last year, the ordinary revenues were 1,741,000,000 rials. I hus, we have had this year, in spite of a considerable decline in customs reve nue, an increase amounting to 1,045,000,000 rials, or 59/1 percent. When we turn to the commercial operations of the Government, the available figures tell a somewhat different story. I or the same nine months period, the total receipts in 1322 were 2,042.000,000 rials, while in 1321 they were 1,749,000,000 rials. The increase in the current year was 293.000,000 rials or 16.7 per cent. Commercial expenditures in 1322 for the same period were 3,061,000,000 rials; while in 1321 they amounted to 2,133,000,000 rials. The increase in 1322 was 928,000,000 rials. The deficit in commercial opera tions last year at the end ol Azar was 384,000,000 rials. The deficit this year at the same time was 1,019.000,000 rials. The total receipts this year, both ordinary and commercial, amounted at the end of Azar to 4,828,000,000 rials. The total expenditures were 5.985.000. 000 rials. The deficit was 1,157,000,000 rials, compared with a defi cit last year in both ordinary and commercial operations of 569,000,000 rials. The ordinary expenditures for the same period amounted in 1322 to 2.924.000. 000 rials and in 1321 to 1,926,000,000 rials, representing an increase for the current year of 998,000.000 rials, or 51.8 percent. Last year the Government had at the end of Azar a deficit in its ordinary operations amounting to 185,000,000 rials. This year the deficit at the same time and for the same operations was 138,000.000 rials. The deficit in the operations of the Cereals and Bread Section appa-— 17 — / / / C!£i&gt; eceipts arded. form, on a public imate. i first mding I bus, reve- t, the onths l they ► rials icriod rials, pera- t this inted were defi- 0,000 22 to ■ease ’ the lions and rently accounts for a very large part of the Government deficit. According to ihc figures at hand, which are not to be taken as final, the receipts for the first nine months of this year for the sale of cereals and bread amonted ^ 521,000,000 rials, but the disbursements for the same period totalled i,J44,000,000 rials, leaving a deficit of 823,000,000 rials. Without any detailed or final analysis, one may be sure that the operations of the Cereals and Bread Sc cl ion present the most important and serious financial problem with which we have to deal.State General Supply Corporation ^ In other connections, 1 liave mentioned certain changes made in the functions of the State General Supply C orporation. Mr. Hansen has been appointed Director-General of the Corporation, retaining his post as Admi nistrator of Procurement. Mr. Hansen’s appointment was followed by (he resignation of Mr. Brinch. Personnel During the past twelve months the efforts of my associates and my self have been directed solely to making the organisation under our super vision efficient, honest, economical, and productive of the results that the Iranian people desire. It is needless for me to repeat that we have met with almost insurmountable obstacles in the accomplishment of our task. Much of our difficulty can be related to the question of personnel. An important factor in the personnel problem is the question of salaries. From the beginning, every Chief of Administration has been handicapped in his work by his inability to pay the salaries which are necessary to attract and hold good men and provide them with incentives to do their best work. Not only have salaries been inadequate and inequitable, but the engagement of men and the actual payment of their salaries have been accompanied by delay, time-wasting formalities, and irritating technicalities. Blame for the general situation should not be put on the officials of the Personnel Administration. The trouble goes deeper. An important basic cause is, of course, the disorder and inflation that have resulted in large part from the War. Another important cause, however, is to be found in the amazing tangled mass of laws and regulations that have accumulated through the years and which at present work injustice to the employee and cripple the Government. Whatever progress we can make in the stabilization of prices will help to remove the first of these basic causes. The second can be remedied only by the Majless. We have taken the position, which we still believe to be sound, that we must follow two general courses: 1) We must obey and execute the laws and those regulations which have the force of law; and2) We must not accord to any administration, institution or official any freedom in the fixing of salaries for the same class of employees which is not accorded to other administrations, institutions and officials. I he Help-to-Employees Law gave some relief. It would have had a better effect if it had not been superimposed on a bad salary structure. 1 lie next indispensable step undone that has already been demanded by the Majless itself is a general revision of the Civil Service Law and Regulations. Mr, Brownrigg, Director-General of Personnel, has already accom plished much in bringing order out of confusion and in settling urgent problems. He is now engaged in the preparation of a project of law which, in my opinion, will permit the Iranian Government to establish a modern personnel system, protecting the employee s interests and contributing to administrative efficiency. Mr. Reynolds has arrived and has taken up his duties as Mr. Brown- rigg's assistant. We hope to have soon another qualified American to assist in this vital work. Various changes in the directing personnel of the Ministry and of its connected organizations have been mentioned in the course of this re port. 1 wish to add a word about the appointment of Americans to provin cial positions. It has been the hope and understanding that an American Finance Director would at an early date be stationed in every province. When this is done I am confident that we shall have throughout the coun try a more honest and efficient financial administration; better collection of grain, cotton, rice, and other monopolized commodities; better distribu tion of goods to the people; and a better transportation system. It has been a keen disappointment, therefore, that, after the appointment of Mr. Gordon as Finance Director of Khorassan, his departure should have been long delayed for reasons beyond our control. This delay has caus ed damage and losses to the Iranian Government and to the people of Khorassan. Mr. Pixley has been appointed Director-General of Accounts and Audits. In this position, he will be assisted by Mr. Hutchins. Mr. Monk and Mr. Caton, recently arrived from the United States, have been desig nated also as assistants to Mr. Pixley. e, l&gt;x|— 20 — In concluding this report, let me convey to Your Excellency my cordial thanks for your cooperation and the renewed assurances of my most distinguished consideration.

Your Excellency: I have the honor to submit herewith my report for the month of Azar, 1322 (November 23-December 22, 1943). The following organizations submitted reports in accordance with the Regulations: I he Department ol (Correspondence and Archives The Reemployment Administration Ihe General Inspection Administration The Finance Prosecutor Ihe Internal Revenue Administration Ihe Administration of Ceded Properties, Public Domains and Exploitation I he Administration of Tobacco and Opium Monopolies The Treasury General 1 he Cereals and Bread Section The Administration of the Bread of Tehran. Grain Collection Mr. Crawford, Chief Administrator of the Cereals and Bread Section.with the assistance of the other officials of the Section, took effective mea sures during the month to complete engagements and collections. Deliveries of grain were expedited by the transportation help furnished by the Allies^ The comparative table below shows by months the engagements and collections during the present season : Comparative Monthly Statement, 1322 Figures in tons - 2/3 wheat 1/3 barley 1.

As the land lords reach the end of their deliveries, it is natural also that the total of collections should decrease. Nevertheless, the figures for collections may be looked* upon as fairly satisfactory. It will be kept in mind that, due to delayed reports, about half of the reports on which the above figures are based reflected the situation as of the middle of Azar. The following table shows engagements and collections by provinces. Collections already exceed the total engagements in Semnan and Damghan, Qum, and Khuzistan, while in Kurdistan, Aligudarz and Tehran the collec tion work is nearly completed.The month of Azar marked the end of the normal period lor the collection of engagements in most of the warmer sections of the country. As a penalty for the non-delivery of the remaining commitments the prieq^ of new collections was reduced by 1/3, namely from 3,000 to 2,000 Rials. Next month this penalty will go into effect in the cooler areas of the country. To encourage the sale to the Government of the surplus landlords’ grain and the peasants’ grain, and to provide some much needed sugar for the peasants, it was decided to give sugar as part payment lor the giain. Fifteen percent of the value of the grain was offered for the first month, ten percent for the next month and five percent for the third month. After that any undelivered surplus grain will be considered as hoarded, and will be confiscated by the Government. This sugar barter scheme was first inaugurated in Ahwaz, and to date some 3,000 tons of wheat have been purchased there in this manner. A total of about 2,000 tons has also been purchased in the other areas where this scheme has been operating, lo help in assuring an equitable distribut ion of sugar to the villagers, it was decided that only two tons of grain would be purchased from any one person on the sugar-barter basis. Un fortunately, it was found that in many areas the villagers no longer had possession of their surplus grain, since it had already been turned o\ei to landlords or merchants. It has, therefore, been impossible to purchase large quantities of grain in those areas. The table below shows arrivals of grain in Tehran by months: Monthly Arrivals of Grain in Tehran Figures in tons, 2/3 wheat and 1/3 barley Zone Mordad-Sliahrlvnr Mtdir Abnn Azar Total Tehran b,54() 8,802 3,227 2.743 21,312 Azerbaijan, Ci- j Ian, Zanjan, Maz-l andaran, Gurgan.j 129 837 4.243 5,209 Khorassan ' Other Provinces — 114 4,231 8,753 13.098 Total 6,540 9,045 8,295 15,739 39,619 The achievement of transporting 15,739 tons of grain to Tehran during Azar was made possible by the larger number of transport units both in the South and in the North. In the South this was due to the increasedBritish Army convoy lift from Ramadan. Largely because of tin's timely and substantial assistance we were able to build up the stocks in Tehran ^_to a total of about 16,500 tons. Included in this figure are about 4,000 tons jf wheat, 2,500 tons of Hour (including white), 7,500 tons of barley, and 2,500 tons of other adulterants. The total stocks of grain held by the Gov ernment in the country at the end of Azar were around 110,000 tons. As collection work in the South nears its end, more and more l.G. Pool trucks have been released there, and many of these have been moved up to the North. This has made it possible to increase the collections in the main shipping centers in this zone, and as a result over five times as much grain was shipped South by rail to Tehran this month as in the previous month. Nevertheless, only about two-thirds of the promised railroad shipping space from the Northern provinces was actually made use of. (Much more transport is still needed in these localities before we can hope to get all the surplus grain that is promised for Tehran. It is especially hoped that the transport of grain from Tabriz will start at a very early date. I he following table shows the distribution ol l.G. Pool trucks work- ing on grain collection in Iran at the end of the past three months: I. G.

Shortage of capable and trustworthy personnel for organizing and controlling the transport work prevents efficient use of the already too few vehicles. Shortage of animal transport has also made it difficult for the landlords to deliver their grain to the local collection centers, this shortage is aggravated by the extremely high transport charges paid by other agencies i.e. the sugar-beet industry. The high ton- kiloineter rate paid lor truck transport has also made it almost impossible for wheat collection work to obtain the services of contracted trucks.Tho ('crenls and Bread Section also had difficulty in geliiug tlu 1 f quired sugar for the sugar barter scheme; and another handicap to the collecting work was the delay in getting cash out to the buying centers^ In some instances this difficulty may be attributed to delay in telegraph and postal service. Cereal collection expenditures since Ordibehesht, 1322 are reported as follows : Up to llie end of Mordad During Shahrivar During Mehr During Aban During Azar Total 230.000. 000 Rials 100 . 000 . 000 » 171.800.000 » 134.400.000 » 156.750.000 » 792.050.000 Rials Minor changes in organization and various changes in personnel were , made during the month under report, f inally, the Cereals and Bread Sec tion is actively engaged in the preparation of a sound program for next year. Bread of Tehran As in ihe case of grain-collection, the administration of the bread of Tehran has shown marked improvement, with a gratifying decline of pub lic complaint. For this improvement, 1 am happy to give appropriate credit to Colonel Saffari, ihe Director-General of the Administration of the Bread of Tehran. During Azar the distribution of bread proceeded in a more orderly manner, due, it is reported, to the following factors: 1. Drop in the price of grain in the provinces, which has caused a reduction in the rate of bread in Tehran; 2. The issue of flour transportation permit to landowners and house holders as per regulation; 3. This Administration s severe control of the activities of bakeries, which has, to a certain extent, prevented the sale of flour by ba kers and forced them to utilize the same for bread to be distribu ted among the public;4. I he prompt execution of sentences against infringing bakers (under the Shopkeepers Prosecuting Act); 5. Preventing the activities of profiteering elements; 6. Execution of instruction respecting the two baking sessions: mor ning and evening. Lack of space unfortunately prevents the publication of C olonel Saf ari's excellent report in its entirety, which includes information regarding improvements in the inspection service; correction of defects in the Central Bakery; licensing, closing, and opening of bake shops; the execution of the coupon system; the condition of the accounts; and the inadequacies of the bread-transport system. The quality of the city bread is not yet satisfac tory, because of the presence of foreign substances in the flour. At present, the mixture consists of seventy percent wheat flour, twenty percent barley, and ten percent white flour. Unfortunately, a small amount of sand and other substances is also present. Steps are being taken by the Cereals and Bread Section to bring about improvement in this respect. Internal Revenue In submitting his report, Mr. Pixley, Director-General of Internal Revenue, points out that he is taking steps to have proper statistical data for presentation in future months. In the absence of these data, it is im possible to report as accurately as is desired the activities of this Admin istration, nor can the Administration carry out its duties effectively. I he Indirect Taxation Department has carried out its routine inspec tions. Some violations of the laws have been found and lines assessed where applicable. The prices of alcoholic beverages in the Tehran area have been re vised downward, and similar action has been recommended to the provin cial financial agents. To allow the movement of alcoholic liquors to consu ming centers and in view of the scarcity of bottles, permits have been granted to move such liquors outside of stamped bottles under control of this Administration. In general, tax collection under this Department was satisfactory. However, in view of reports that the tax on bicycles and carriages would be abolished, receipts from these sources have declined. Cooperation of thePolice Department lias been requested with a view to full collection of these taxes, and satisfactory results are expected. Difficulty in collecting the Three Per Cent lax on goods coming into Tehran developed due to failure of truck drivers to stop at collection posts. The cooperation of the Gendarmerie was requested, and detail of an adequate number of gendarmes to assure proper control was made immediately. This cooperation is appreciated and is expected to bring about better collections. Collections of the Indirect Taxation Department for Tehran and for the month of Azar 1321 and 1322 follow: Sources of Revenue Azar 1322 Azar 1321 3°/ 0 tax 1,582,391.35 1,132,706.80 Tax on Benzine and Kerosene 20,753,664.45 13,599,917.40 Tax on Alcoholic Liquors 8,123.120.60 3.972,517.65 Slaughter lax 134.579.50 196,524.80 Forest Products Tax Per Cent 41,892.60 33,939.50 Minerals 334,594.70 228,484.90 Mines 5°/ 0 13,283.25 3,223.50 Horse-drawn Carriages 11,035.00 15,988.60 Auction Tax 147,790.00 98,956.75 Bicycles 5,600.70 41,001.50 Electricity Tax 906,962.30 1,133,599.65 Stamp Duties 21,215.00 38,927.00 Miscellaneous 430.707.15 12,497.50 Total 32,506,836.60 20,508,285.55 In the Direct Taxation Department, the drafting of regulations for the new income tax law has been in progress. Steps are being taken to organize the appraisal of agricultural products for purposes of assessing the new income tax. Mr. Ahmadi, (ormer President of the Re-Employment Commission, has been appointed to supervise this work. In view of the general situation, direct tax receipts are disappoint ing. 1 his is due to many factors, some of which have not yet been de termined. Office space is inadequate and not adapted to the work. Some reorganization of the flow of work is necessary and some changes in per sonnel. The Revision Commission did not meet during the month, and many files are blocked there.t Collections in the Tehran District for Azar, 1321 and Azar, 1322 are shown below : Source* of IteTcnuc Azar 1322 Azar 1321 Tax on Companies 2,038,614.50 1,518,927.05 l ax on Contractors 502,644.20 1,110,974.75 Tax on Salaries 5.710.144.85 5,767,997.95 Differences 147,001.40 21,428.80 Account Dept. 58,840.35 69,278.55 Tehran Income Tax Dept. 1,968,754.85 868,254.85 Transport Section 241,391.70 159,919.00 Total 10,667,391.85 9,516,780.95 I he Director of the Concession Department reports that, according to information received from the Anglo-1 ranian Oil Company, an interim dividend of five percent has been paid by the Company to the sharehold ers lor the year 1943 on 30th Azar, 1322. 1 he Government should receive £/)7,125. but this sum will be carried to the account of the £2,675,000 which the Company had paid as advance. The payment of interim dividend shows that the Company’s financial and commercial condition in the year 1943 has been quite satisfactory. Appropriate action has also been taken with respect to the Irano- Soviet Fisheries Company, other concessionary companies, and the mines. Tobacco and Opium Monopolies Mr. Nikpay, Director-General of the Tobacco and Opium Monopolies, also points out the difficulties in the way of presenting adequate statistical data. I he full statistics received up to the end of Azar show the purchases of smoking raw materials:— 10 — Commodities Quantities Cigarette tobacco Kgs. 279,221 Iranian pipe and half-bruised tobacco Kgs. 296,910 Narguileh tobacco Kgs. 78,550 I The manufactured goods in (lie factories at the end ol Azar are re ported as follows: Commodities Cigarettes Cigars Iranian pipe tobacco Narguileh tobacco Nicotin Sulphate Pieces 214,652,640 40,975 kilogram* 261.470 70,025 620 The revenues of the Tobacco Monopoly are reported as follows: Source Amount From sale of commodities in the Center Ills. 55,735,069.40 Sundry revenues in the Center 367,712.75 Towns’ tobacco revenues transferred to the Treasury General 1,879,379.95 Toiul Ills. 57,982,162.10 Ceded Properties, Public Doinains and Exploitation Mr. Emami, Director-General of the Administration of Ceded Pro perties, Public Domains and Exploitation, has submitted a comprehensive and convincing plan for reorganization of the work within his j urisdiction, and the plan is under careful consideration. In the meantime, current ac tivities have been carried on, including inspections, certain changes in personnel, a commendable handling of correspondence, liquidation of pro perty claims, repairs of buildings, canals, et cetera, and completion of the plan for Yussefabad lands and their classification. Personnel Since my last preceding report the execution of the Help-to-Employ- ees Regulations has been practically completed. Certain effects, not fore-seen, have resulted; and study is being given to the problems thus created. On the whole, we feel that definite encouragement has been given to the employees of the Government and that they are working with better spirit than formerly. We are also making progress in weeding out the incompe tent and dishonest, and we are glad that we are obtaining the loyal services of an increasing number of efficient and honest employees. We hope that discipline will improve and that we shall find among officials and employ- ; ees a more general disposition to obey the regulations and orders of the Ministry. At present, the situation in this respect is not at all satisfactory. It should be taken for granted that, when regulations are issued, they are to be strictly observed. It is my intention to note carefully all cases of non-observance of regulations, and the official or employee respon sible for such non-observance will be appropriately dealt with. No or ganization of the size of ours can be administered on any other basis. I he departure of Mr. Shambarger, Director-General of Accounts and Audits, was in accordance with a privilege granted to him in his contract and agreed upon before he left the United States. Nevertheless, the loss of his services will be greatly regretted. Mr. Hutchins has been appointed Acting Director-General of Accounts and Audits to serve until this res ponsible post is permanently filled. Other important personnel changes which have occurred since my last report include the resignation of Dr. Atkins as Director-General of Industrial Supervision; the appointment of Mr. Brownrigg as Director-General of Personnel; the appointment of Mr. Ferguson as Administrator of Rationing in the Price Stabilization Sec tion; the arrival of Messrs. Shields, Hurst, Breitenbach and Welton and their assignment to the Road Transport Department; the appointment of Mr. Gordon as Finance Director of Khorassan: the transfer of Mr. Chase to the Price Stabilization Section; and the appointment of Miss Da vidson as American Secretary of the Administrator General of the Finan ces. The appointment of Mr. Brownrigg. as Director-General of Personnel was for administrative reasons, in accordance with a general policy. It was not due to dissatisfaction with the services of Mr. Manoocherian, whose hard work and conscientious devotion to duty are fully and gratefully ac knowledged. 1 am especially appreciative of Mr. Manoocherian’s willingness to remain for a time in the Personnel Administration and act in collabora tion with Mr Brownrigg,/ ITT — 12 — In conclusion, 1 wish to convey to 'l our Excellency my appreciation of your cordial cooperation and the assurance of my most distinguished consideration. A. f. Millspaugh Administrator General of the Finances WWNO¥-H -uaivoijjQmmm REPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR GENERAL OF THE FINANCES OF IRAN FOR THE MONTH of MEHR, 1322 (September 24 - October 23, 1943) His Excellency. The Minister of Finance. \ our Excellency: I have the honor to submit herewith my report for the month of Mehr, 1322 (September 24-October 23, 1943). Although the economic and financial situation with which the Ame rican Mission is concerned remains critical, the outlook has become in some respects more encouraging. 1 he improvement that has occurred may be credited to the support of His Imperial Majesty, action taken by the Majless, assistance rendered by the Allies, cooperation of the Government, streng thening of the American Mission, the services of our Iranian associates and employees, and various administrative measures. We are fortunate in working under the high auspices of His Impe rial Majesty, who, since our arrival, has shown the most sympathetic and intelligent interest in the problems and progress of administration and in the welfare of his people. The Majless. through the enactment of the project authorizing the employment of sixty Americans for the Financial Mission, has made it pos sible for us to establish in the near future an organization throughout Iran which will greatly help to eliminate dishonest practices and increase admi nistrative efficiency, thus contributing to the welfare of all the people of'•ail. By its approval of the Income Tux Project, the Majless has given the Government a most important means of putting the finances in orile, ami stabilizing prices. By this action, the Iranian Parliament has done much to earn the confidence of the people. The leaders and members of the Parliament, subordinating personal considerations and influences and their own interests, have acted for the welfare of their country. They have gone far, perhaps in some respects as far as any other law-making body in the world, to meet the demands of a great emergency. They have shown that ran intends to stand on its own feet, put its own house in order, and vin- K-ate its position as an independent nation. I have no doubt that the same spirit of patriotism and statesmanship will be shown by the Majless in the future. 1 am happy, in this public manner, to express for the American Mis sion our appreciation of the assistance rendered by the honorable deputies. 1C ncome I ax Law that has been passed contains provisions which were inserted during the final debate and which will hamper the execution of the Law. How damaging these provisions are will be later determined; but if. in practice, d.ey make the collection of the tax impossible, the Majless no doubt will be willing to approve the necessary changes. It is an equal pleasure to record the assistance (hat has recently been ° C ' e&lt; 0 ‘' g ' Ven by Allied authorities. The United States Treasury Depart- ment has expressed it, wiJlingness to conclude a stabilization agreement with (he Iranian Ministry of Finance and the Banque Melli Iran. This Agreement, if it is authorized by the Majless, will enable the Iranian overnment to borrow from the Banque Mellie up to $ 30,000,000 to cover any deficit that may occur in our financial operations; and, under the proposed Agreement, the currency of Iran would continue to be backed the U ,te e d rC sT reSer :, e ;' S P T ided ^ laW ' A Le, ' d - LcaSC Ag ™t between fai.e TT\ Iran 1135 beCn SUbmi “ ed ‘&gt;&gt;e approval of the • J S, and the Iranian Government continues to have the advantage of favorable te C rms am ^ ^ imP ° rtant ^ -quirement on most Having been informed of the grain-collection situation, the Soviet SrTw t f t0 t 7 ranSP ° r ‘ ‘° Tehri ' 1 18 ' 00 ° of ^ain from Azer- &gt; an, 2,000 tons from Zanjan, 10,000 tons from Khorassan, and 10,000 tons | g i' 1 ’ r 1 t0 transp0rt 12 ’ 000 ‘ ons rice to Tehran.

It is necessary for the Iranian Government to supply trucks for local col-mmmmm lections and for the transport of grain from Meslied to Shaliroud. We have asked the Soviet authorities to take charge of the Iranian Government ^ trucks sent to Azerbaijan, to appoint a number of Soviet Liason Officers for the collection and transportation of grain in the northern provinces, and in general to assist in the collection of grain. We are mindful, of course, of the needs of the Soviet forces in the region where they are sta tioned; but we are assured that the Soviet authorities will not require this year any unreasonably large quantities of wheat and barley, f or this assis tance and for other aid rendered by the Soviet authorities, we are happy to express our appreciation. If the arrangement works out successfully, as I believe it will, it should do much to assure the food-supply of Tehran dur ing the coming Winter. It is needless to say that in the South and West we have been taking just as energetic measures for the collection of grain as we have taken or propose to take in the North. In the work of grain-collection and transpor tation British officials have lent great assistance. Faced with a breakdown in our own transport facilities, British authorities promptly agreed to allo cate a large number of their trucks for the transportation of 10 000 tons of grain, from Kermanshah to Ramadan and Arak and to Tehran via Kazvin. At the time of writing, I am informed that about 450 trucks have been placed on this work and that more trucks may be available. For this ex traordinary assistance, which will also do much to assure the food supply of Tehran, we are likewise grateful. Transportation l he assistance in transportation recorded above, which has been of fered and rendered by Allied authorities, has been made necessary because of a breakdown of Iranian transport facilities. Accordingly, I desire to present more fully than has previously been done the essential facts regar ding this transportation problem. The trucks that are supposed to be under the direct control of the Road T ransport Department fall into two classes: (1) the Iranian Govern ment Pool Lorries and (2) the contracted lorries. The Road T ransport Department has 897 Iranian Government Pool Lorries. Their disposition on 12 Aban. 1322 ( 4 November, 1943) is shown below :Tehran 24 666 Available in Tehran for grain collection and transport 21 687 Factories Carbonate of soda—Tehran 5 Cotton &amp; Silk — Shahi 3 Fish canning — Bandar Abbas 4 Glycerin — Tehran 3 Goodron 3 18 Govemment Departments Anti — Locust 3 Irrigation (Behbehan) 1 „ (Isfahan) 1 Khuzistan Agricultural Scheme 7 Price Stabilization, Tehran 10 Mines 13 Posts &amp; Telegraphs 1 Road Transport Department Inspection Tehran 1 Service Tehran 1 l ire Transport 12 Sugar Refineries 5 lea 7 Mar 44 Total Government Depts. 106 Miscellaneous 6 Under Repair Skoda Plant — Tehran 8 Heavily Damaged „ 15 Minor Repairs 57 Total Under Repair 80 687 705 811 817 897 GRAND TOTAL 897I he Hoad Transport Department has (on paper) 1272 contracted lor ries. I lie correctness of this figure may be doubted, since, in numerous cases, it has been established that one lorry has been operating under two or three different police numbers. On 4 Aban, 1322 (27 October. 1943) the whereabouts of only 650 contracted lorries were definitely known. The con tractors have been unable to furnish accurate information regarding the disposition of the fleet. Neither the Hoad Transport Department nor the the contractors themselves have had adequate control over these contracted trucks; and it has not been possible to depend on these trucks to remain on any specified operation for any length of time. It should be noted that on 12 Aban, eighty of the Iranian Government Pool lorries, less than 10 per cent of the total number, were under repair; on the other hand, at least 25 or 30 per cent of the contract fleet has been continually laid up for repairs. Moreover, neither the Iranian Government Pool lorries nor the con tracted lorries which are in operation operate at anywhere near full effi ciency. I lu principal icasons lor the unsatisfactory transportation situation are (1) shortcomings in organization and administration, (2) inflation, ^inad equate control, and (4) insffucient maintenance facilities. Shoi (comings in organization and administration are due in part to the lack of a trained and experienced supervisory personnel. This is said without any disparagement of the work of the American officials now in the Hoad Transport Department. They have worked well; but there have not been enough of them, and they have not had time enough. In a highly technical branch of administration where they have been under extreme pressure, they have had to cope with those long-standing conditions which have thrown the work of the entire Government into disorder and reduced it to a low state of efficiencv, 1 ransport has been seriously handicapped, like other administrations of the Government, by the disorganization which has prevailed in the provinces. If we had insufficient time a capable Ame rican in every district of Iran, the organization and administration of trans port, like the organization and administration of other governmental work, would have markedly improved. Measures to improve organization and ad ministration were foreseen months ago and are now rapidly coming to fruition.I ransportation, like other operations of the Government, has been disastiously affected by inflation. Rising prices have discouraged the em ployees and furnished a powerful incentive to disobey orders and engage in dishonest practices. Rising prices have also provided an almost irresistable temptation lor lorries to slip away from control and carry goods at the frec- markei rate. 1 have authorized an increase of freight-rates in order to pro vide more inducements for truck-owners to work for the Government. Honest and efficient control has been lacking throughout the country, fo remedy this deficiency so far as possible, new regulations have been promulgated establishing more severe penalties and providing better means ol enforcement. These regulations prohibit filling-stations from supplying petrol to any truck not operating with a proper permit and way-bill. The Road I ransport Department has also started a complete and detailed regis tration of the contracted fleet. 1 ransportation has also been hampered by lack ol maintenance facili ties. Steps have been taken lo deal with this aspect of the situation. Because ol the situation which has just been brieflv reviewed, it has been necessary to call on the Allied Authorities for assistance in the trans portation of grain. Iheir gratifying response has already been noted. It should also be noted with appreciation that the Ministry of War has placed lilty trucks on the Hamadan-Arak run for the carrying of grain. I he conditions mentioned above and particularly the necessity of gi\ ing priority to the transportation of grain, have made it difficult and to an extent impossible for the Road Transport Department to provide adequately for certain essential transportation needs. These relate principally to fuel, sugar-beets, tobacco, and bread distribution in the city of Tehran. I hope in a succeeding report to give Your Excellency and the public a full state ment of the facts on each of these problems. It will be sufficient at this time to say that the responsibility for the fuel and sugar-beet situations does not rest entirely on the Road Transport Department or on my admin istration and this fact will be made quite clear in the future. Although regrettable delay has occurred, I feel hopeful that fuel in sufficient quan tities and at reasonable prices will be provided in time and the sugar-beet growers will not incur serious losses.Grain-Collection The following information regarding the progress of grain collection^ has already been made public. - We aim in 1322 to collect 350.000 tons of grain. I he total ol land owner's engagements on 3 Aban. l322(October 26, 1943) amounted *0 265,581 tons. The actual quantity collected from these engagements was 113,446 tons. |This information for most of the provinces was as of 5 * j r - (October 8, 1943).] The stocks in the lehran Silo on ,» Aban totalled 10,,1 White flour 2,214 Tons Wheat » 987 - Wheat 534 w Barley 4,578 M Birdseed 2.406 10,719 r&gt; In addition, grain has been delivered to the Army for the needs of the Teh ran garrison over and above the Army’s daily needs. The Provincial Kharbar offices held the following total stocks ol grain on 20 Mehr, 1322 : Wheat 30,519 tons Barley 20,070 „ Total 50,589 „ For comparison, the following figures are given of engagements and collections last year as of 15 Mehr. Engagements 125,043 tons Collections 68.641 „ It will be seen that the total of engagements this year amounts to about twice what it was last year on the same date and the total of collections almost twice the figure for last year on the same date. Up to 3 Aban of this year comparativaly little grain had been mov ed to Tehran from outside the Tehran area. This delay was partly delib erate, since, because of the poor harvest last year, no stocks were on hand in the provincial towns at the beginning of this year’s harvest, lo start moving grain to Tehran immediately would have caused anxiety among the local populations and in some cases actual deprivation. 1'rom now on, of course, the supply for Tehran will depend increasingly on theEarly in Aban, the following towns had been declared free for the purchase and transport of grain from their local areas: Semnan, Shahrud, Qum, Kashan, Khorammabad, azd. Zahidan, and Behbehan. Resht and the towns of Mazanderan have always been free. In Zenjan, permission was given to all landowners, even before the completion of their engagements, to bring in their surplus grain for their family needs. Permission has also been given to the landlords of the Tehran area to deliver grain and Hour to the district ambars, the same quantity to be supplied to them from the Tehran Silo for the needs of their families. 1 have also decided to issue permits to Tehran householders gene rally for the purchase of grain to supply their families. It is necessary to include certain restrictions and safeguards in this permit system in order to prevent so far as possible the withholding of grain by landlords and peasants from sale to the Government at (he Government price and also to prevent hoarding and speculation. It is believed, however, that the system decided upon will not prevent any householder from obtaining grain and flour to meet his legitimate needs. In fact, the system is designed to serve the interests of the householder, while protecting him against exor bitant prices and the competition of middlemen and speculators. The system also keeps in view the interests of the masses of the people. It is our first duty to supply food for all. Bread of Tehran After careful consideration and in order to facilitate the adminis tration of grain-collection as well as the administration of the baking and distributing of bread in Fehran, I have established the Administration of Bread separately from the Cereals and Bread Section. The new Adminis tration is headed by a Director-General responsible to me. Prior to this action, I had appointed an Advisory Commission, consisting of Dr. Mosharef Nafici, Chairman. Mr. Ali Vakili, and Colonel Saffari, to make a thorough study of the troublesome and difficult bread situation, with reference to which numerous and justified complaints have been made. This Committee has no responsibility for administration. Certain recommendations of the Commission have already been put into ellect: others have been accepted and are in process of execution, while still others are under consideration.Price Stabilization Our policy has been and still is to stabilize prices by controlling a few essential commodities, particularly grain, bread, sugar, tea, cotton piece- goods, drugs, and fuel; to promote increased imports; in the case of com modities produced in Iran, to increase their production; and distribute these few staple commodities on a rationed basis and at fixed prices. W hile under taking this program, we proposed various measures to draw off the excess purchasing power created by Governmenlal borrowings and Allied spending; for example, economy in Government expenditures, sale of gold and silver, issue of Treasury bonds, and the Income Tax Project. Of the essential commodities named above, it is believed that adequate supplies are now available in the country and that no general shortage will exist in the future. Due to lack of American personnel and to the conditions which hamper governmental administration in general, the Price Stabilization Section has not thus far been able to handle promptly and properly the functions relating to requirements, procurement, and the licensing of imports and exports. The principal and most serious deficiency, however, has been in the field of distribution. At present, we are concen trating all our efforts on the solution of this problem. The distribution difficulties have been due in the main (1) to con gestion at the ports and obstacles to rapid and free movement from the ports, (2) to internal transportation difficulties, and (3) to shortcomings in organization and administration. Each of these main factors is highly com plicated but each has been dealt with and I feel that progress has been made and will continue at an accelerated rate, although it must be admit ted that the situation is at present by no means satisfactory. The Divisions of Procurement, Rationing and Distribution have been strengthened. The movement of goods is better coordinated. Adequate at tention is being given to the organization and administration of distribution both in Tehran and in the provinces. With respect to the production of goods within the the country, the responsibility largely rests upon other Ministries, particularly the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. We shall be glad to have the cooperation of the merchants in the procurement and distribution of goods, provided that a plan of cooperationmay be worked out which will safeguard the public against a rise of pri ces and insure fair distribution. t The Financial Situation It will be evident from what has been said above that the foremost concern of the Government, the American Mission and the public during the last few weeks has been with pressing economic problems.In the mean time. however, the various branches of the financial administration have proceeded with the performance of their duties and. on the whole, have been operating satisfactorily. Moreover, in various directions improvement has been made. The following table of receipts and disbursements from 1 farvardin to 15 Aban has been supplied by the Treasurer General.

Apart of this amount has been obtained from an advance on the Oil Royalties, a part from the sale of assets, and a part from non recurring income. Moreover, during the last five months of 1322, we shall have large expenditures for the purchase of grain, rice and cotton, and also an expenditure of approximately 500.000,GOO Rials for help to the employees. It should also be kept in mind that we have been compelled to take or refrain from taking certain actions, the result of which may be to decrease the net income in the Commercial Account.

The Minister of f inance. Your Excellency: 1 have the honor to submit herewith my report for the Month of Shahrivar, 1322 (24 August - 23 September. 1943). In this Report, as in preceding ones, I shall concern myself with the large situation and problems that are of outstanding and critical impor tance and of acute interest to the Government and the public. These relate to taxation, grain and bread, price-stabilization, and transportation. Taxation In the field of taxation, the American Financial Mission has propo sed one major project, that for the revision of the income-tax. After many conferences, we proposed this project to the Government and it was prompt ly submitted by the Government to the Majless. The Financial Laws Com mission of the Majless held many discussions and finally prepared its own revision of the project which was prepared by us and accepted by the Government. The Commission sent to me its proposals and* 1 submitted to the Commission a statement the essential portions of which 1 am reprin ting below. To the Financial Laws Commission of the Majless: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of the report which the Financial Laws Commission has made on the subject of the Income Tax Project. You— 2 — have asked me to express my views on this report before you submit it to the Majless. Before doing so, 1 want to explain again the purposes and the need ^ of this law. The purposes are four: (1) I o combat inflation; (2) to cover the go vernmental deficit; (3) to distribute the burden of taxation more justly; and (4) to pave the way for social reforms. (1) In the Law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322, the Majless granted me broad powers to stabilize prices. Since this law was passed the American finan cial Mission and myself have been blamed by some o( the newspapers and even by members of the Majless for a further rise in the prices of various commodities. I shall disregard in this statement the various obstacles that we have met with in the execution of the Law of 13 Ordibehesht; but l must remind the members of the Commission and of the Majless that I have always been careful to explain that the Law of 13 Ordibehesht is not alone sufficient to stabilize prices. I he most important and the most essen tial means of combatting inflation is taxation. By taxation, purchasing power is reduced, the demand for goods lessened, and thus prices tend to remain stable or to fall. All economists agree on the necessity of heavy taxation in a time of inflation. In the United States, Creat Britain and other countries, the people are taxed more heavily than ever before, not only to pay the costs of the war but also to aid in preventing an increase in the cost of living. &lt;ec jxi.'ea Ichrcio despalch, Ctbooe. (2) Largely because of emergency conditions, we shall have a large deficit this year in the financial operations of the Government. If a deficit is not covered, the result is bankruptcy; that is, the Government becomes unable to pay the salaries of its employees and its other debts. A deficit can be covered in one of two ways: by borrowing or by increased taxation. It is now too late to cover this years deficit by taxation alone. We shall have to borrow; and, if the Majless gives the necessary authorization, we expect that the United States Treasury Department will enter into a sta bilization agreement with the Ministry of Finance and the Banque Mellie Iran. This agreement will probably enable us to pay all the expenses of the Government this year. To cover a deficit in this manner, however, will be inflationary, unless the inflationary effect is counteracted by an imme diate increase of taxes. Furthermore, we cannot borrow or obtain financial help from the United States indefinitely. Next year's budget must be abalanced Ijudget. A\ e shall probably not be able to borrow anywhere next year; but, if we should be able to borrow, we would simply be postponing ^ bankruptcy and, in fact, making bankruptcy inevitable. If Iran intends to remain a self-respecting and independent nation, it must put its own house in order and pay its own expenses out of its own resources. In fact, I would under no circumstances agree to receiving help from the United States unless or until the Majless had provided for increased revenue by passing the Income 1 ax Law. Statements have been made that there will be no deficit, because revenues will increase and savings will be made in the budget. It is true that revenues are increasing; but I have no hope that the increase will be enough to balance the budget; and, instead of making savings in the budget, we shall have additional emergency expenditures. Moreover, unless we promptly use the tax-weapon to fight a further rise in prices, that rise will necessitate a much larger budget next year. (3) Another purpose of the Income l ax Law is to distribute the bur den of taxation more justly. Present taxes levied in Iran place a dispro portionate burden on the poorer and middle classes. Landowners pay no income-tax; while the 3% tax is actually paid by the consumers of the pro ducts taxed. We propose in the new law that income from agricultural lands should be taxed and the 3% tax, which is a bad tax from every point of view, should be abolished. We have agreed, however, that 50% of the income from agricultural lands should be exempt, and, in addition, the landowner will enjoy other exemptions and deductions provided for in the project. In the new project laborers, peasants, and small landowners pay no tax; and the tax is also reduced on the lower income groups. Govern ment employees, who are in great need of assistance, are also temporarily exempted. In the old income-tax law, the maximum rate on the highest income is only 20%, while in other countries the rate may be four times as high on the largest incomes. 1 he rates in the new project have been fixed on an ascending scale from 2 to 80%; but, if we calculate the rate according to the total taxable income (after providing for exemptions and deductions), the highest rate is only about 44%. This rate is paid by those who have a taxable income of 500.000 rials or more. I have heard all kinds of objections to these rates; but 1 am convin ced that these rates are neither unfair nor excessive. I am also convinced that it is necessary to levy these rates if we are to make any progress in our struggle against inflation and bankruptcy.It is common knowledge that huge profits have been made &gt;n tbi, country. From the point of view of justice and humanity, I cannot approve a system which taxes heavily those who suffer from present condr .on* while taxing lightly those who profit from these cond.t.ons. Nor can 1 ap prove a system under which the rich landlords pay no income tax at all. I believe that a majority of the rich are willing to bear their full share of the burden. In order to help save the Government and the coun try in this emergency they are willing to make sacrifices. I hey are wise and farsighted enough to realize that continued inflation and ultimate bank ruptcy mean revolution; and that revolution means disaster for all and special disaster for the rich. (4) Another purpose of the income-tax project is to pave the way for social reform. Iran has been trying to be modern; but ,t has almost totally neglected the one most precious characteristic of modernity; that is, a social consciousness. In a country that possesses social consciousness the rich feel that they have a duty to the poor, emphasis is put on social services—schools, medicine, hospitals, workmen s insurance, health insurance, improvement of working conditions, and the betterment of rural life. But social welfare, social justice, and social services can not be achieved un ess the rich are willing to make some sacrifice for the benefit of all. It is true that many rich people in Iran are generously participating in charitable enterprises. These people have my respect and praise. But the large-scale social services must be carried on by the Government and supported by taxes. Obviously, such taxes must be paid largely by the rich and well-to- do. Social justice, therefore, begins with taxation. During discussions of this project statements such as the following have been made: (1) That with better administration, we can collect enough from the present income-tax law to cover the deficit; (2) that if our project is passed, we shall collect far more than the Government actually needs; (3) that our proposed taxes will ruin the economic life of the country; and (4) that our taxes will be so heavy as to destroy the standard of living of the people. (t) According to the best estimates that we have been able to get, we may collect this year from the present income-tax law, the 3% tax, the real-estate tax, etc. an amount of 600,000,000 rials. We estimate annual collections from the new tax amounting to 922,000,000 rials. The actual yield in 1321 from the present income-tax law was310.000. 000 rials. We estimate this year from the same tax a revenue of 450.000. 000 rials, it is evident, therefore, that we shall not obtain enough additional revenue from the present law to cover the probable deficit, hurthermore* it is not likely that we can obtain enough revenue from the new law to cover the deficit. (2) Because of the uncertainties of the situation, the Majless should provide the Government with means to obtain the maximum amount of revenue. The deficit this year will be bad enough: but the Government has accumulated a large floating debt which must also be paid. The time to get the needed revenue is during this period of inflation, when, as I have repeatedly pointed out, heavy taxation is necessary to stabilize pri ces. It is certain that the revenue from the proposed income-tax law will not be enough lor the needs of the Government; and we shall therefore submit in due time projects for an increase of the inheritance taxes and for new or increased taxes on luxuries. If, after meeting all the needs of the Government and of the country, we find that we have a surplus in the Treasury, the Majless can reduce the income-tax rates. (3) 1 hat our proposed taxes will ruin the economic life of the country is a ridiculous assertion. Ruin will certainly come if Iran experiences con tinued inflation and ultimate bankruptcy, the two evil conditions that the income-tax project is designed to combat. (4) That the proposed taxes will destroy the standard of living of the people* is equally misleading. Of course, the rich will have less money to spend on luxuries but the poorer and middle classes will have more to spend on necessities. The real enemy of the standard of living is inflation. Even with the higher rates provided in the income-tax project, the people of Iran, even the well-to-do and rich people, will not be heavily taxed compared with the people of other countries. Taxpayers of Iran will pay less than American taxpayers having the same incomes. And it is these heavily-taxed American taxpayers that we are now appealing to for help. The provisions of the original project and the changes proposed by the Financial Laws Commission fall into three main groups: (l) Those relating to exemptions and deductions; (2) those relating to rates: and (3) those relating to administration. Exemptions and Deductions. In our original project, we proposed liberal exemptions and deductions, for the purpose of assuring more jus-tice in taxation, to protect the interests of agriculture and industry, and to drawoff purchasing power in order to combat inflation. 1 hese exemptions and deductions will result in substantial losses ol revenue: and, obviously, such^. exemptions and deductions can not be increased beyond a certain point. Moreover, they must be compensated for by an increase of rates in the up per income groups. If exemptions and deductions are increased while rates are decreased, the effect is to defeat the whole purpose of the law as a revenue producing measure. In order that it may be clear what these exemptions and deductions are, I am listing below* those which were originally in the project and those to which I have agreed in discussions with the financial Laws Commission: 1. Those with incomes of 12,000 rials or less will pay no tax at all. 2. All taxpayers will receive an exemption of 6,000 rials. 3. A married man or one with dependents will receive an additional exemption of 4,000 rials. 4. An exemption of 3,000 rials is provided for each child. 5. Ten percent of income received from salaries, fees and allowances is to be exempt. 6. Interest from savings accounts, fixed deposits and bonds is to be exempt. 7. No tax is to be levied on amounts invested in savings, fixed deposits or government bonds, up to about 50 percent of such amounts. 8. Salaries, fees and allowances received from the Government or from municiplities are to be free of taxation. 9. No tax is to be levied on 50 percent of income derived from agricultural lands. 10. Amounts received as pensions, retirement allowances, and life insurance policy payments are to be exempt. 11. Amounts paid as life insurance premiums are not to be taxed. 12. In computing the taxable income of companies, an amount equal to 15 percent of their paid-in capital is to be deducted. The deputies should also keep in mind that the proposed income tax is not entirely an additional tax. In part, it is merely a substitution of one tax for others. According to our original proposal, the passage of the income tax law would be followed by the abolition of several taxes.including the real-estate tax, the 3% tax, municipal weighing tax, and the electric tax. 1 he I inancial Laws Commission propose the following changes. 1. All taxpayers will receive an exemption of 12,000 rials. We have proposed an exemption of 6.000 rials. I he exemption in the present law is 2,400 rials and no exemption, is given for children and other dependents. We have agreed, as above stated, that all persons receiving an income of 12,000 rials or less will pay no taxes, lo give a general exemption of 12,000 rials to the rich as well as the poor is not only unnecessary but it will cause a serious loss of revenue. 1 he C ommission proposes that one-half of the landlord’s share of agricultural income shall be Iree of taxation, regardless of whether the landlord uses any part of his income for the improvement of his property. We proposed that one-fifth of his income should be free of taxation and an additional one-fourth should be deducted, provided the landlord had made improvements on his property. We agreed in the Commission that the one-fifth should be increased to one-fourth; but we do not agree that the additional deduction of one-fourth should be made unconditionally. It is unfair to treat in the same way the landlord who makes improvements on his property and the landlord who makes no improvements but keeps all of his share to himself. 3. W e proposed that 15 percent of the rentals of properties for resi dential and commercial purposes in towns should be free of taxation. The Commission proposes 25 percent. In view of the exhorbitant rents now being exacted by landlords, a higher exemption than that proposed by us is unnecessary. If this percentage is raised, revenue much needed by the Government will be lost. 4. We proposed that the income of newly-cultivated lands should be free of taxation for two years. The Commission proposes three years. 5. We proposed a deduction of 3.000 rials for each child under 18 dependent on the taxpayer. I he Commission proposes that, in case a tax payer has more than five children, an amount of 4,000 rials should be de ducted for each extra child. I can see no reason whatever for this proposed Change. In the present law, no deduction is allowed for any children. 6. 1 he Commission makes a surprising proposal that an additional amount of 4,000 rials should be deducted for each disabled child and also- a — for the taxpayer's disabled or sick father. The Commission apparently did not consider that the disabled or sick father might have a large income and be himself a taxpayer. Moreover, disablement or sickness is often tempo- ^ rary. The determination of disability or sickness would be administratively impossible. 7. The Commission, on the other hand, omits our proposal to give a deduction of 3,000 rials for each child over 18 and under 25 whom the tax payer is maintaining at an institution of higher learning. 8. The Commission proposes the permanent exemption of Government employees. We proposed they should be exempted during the years 1322 and 1323. During this time of rising prices, the employees need help; but, when the war is over, prices are stabilized, and the salaries of Governmnt employees are raised to level of other classes, their exemption from taxation will no longer be necessary. 9. For the purpose of encouraging savings and thus combatting infla tion. the original project provided for a deduction amounting to nine times the total amount received as interest on savings and fixed deposits and on bonds of the Government of Iran. Fhe Commission changes the nine to three. In my opinion, if only three times the interest is deducted, little it au\ en couragement will be offered to those who have money which should be withdrawn from speculation and the free market. 10. The project written by the Commission exempts the interest paid by a taxpayer on his debts. \\ e proposed that this deduction should apply only in the case of companies. In the case of individuals, such a deduction would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to administer. 11. In computing the taxable income of a company, the Commission proposes a deduction of 18 percent of its paid-in capital. We originally pro posed 12 percent, which represents the legal limit for dividends in Iran.1 he Commission should consider in this connection that 75 percent of our re venue from income taxation comes from companies and that the present law allows no deduction at all. To provide a deduction of 18 percent would mean a very sizable loss of revenue, a loss that the Government can not afford to suffer. 12. The project as revised by the Commission includes an entirely new deduction: the amounts expended in maintaining the health of the la borers and workers. Since the health of the laborers and workers contributes to the productivity of the company and therefore to its income, I can see no reason— 9 — for tliis deduction. Furthermore, it would be, in my opinion, impossible to administer. 13. Hie Commission proposes a serious alteration relative to the com putation of the expenses of partnerships. \\ e proposed that “reasonable amounts paid to the partners for services rendered to the partnership ’ should- be considered necessary expenses of the partnership. The Commission project omits the word “reasonable' and requires that all amounts paid to the partners for services rendered should be deemed necessary expenses. Such a provision would permit the partners to pay all of the profits to themselves in the form of salaries. The result in practice would be that little if any taxes could be collected from partnerships. Rates. The Commission leaves the rates proposed by us unchanged on incomes up to 160,000 rials. These rates in our project were made sub stantially lower than in the present law, in order to give relief to the mid dle classes. What the Commission has done with the rates on the higher in comes is shown in the following table. These rates are. of course, levied only on increments of income, not on the total income. Original project Commission project Incomes Hates Incomes Kates 140,000-160,000 25 &lt;7o 140,000-200,000 25 0 / 0 160,000-200.000 35 200.000-250,000 30 200,000-230,000 45 250,000-350,000 35 250.000-300,000 55 350,000-450,000 40 300,000-350,000 60 450,000-500,000 45 350,000-400,000 . 65 500.000-600,000 55 400,000-500,000 75 600.000-700,000 65 Over 500,000 80 700,000-1,000,000 70 Over 1,000.000 80 If the project were to be passed with the rates proposed by the Commission, my estimate is that less revenue would be produced by the new law than by the old one. If, in addition, the new law were to include the exemptions and deductions already accepted and proposed by the Com- mision, the new law would be absolutely worthless. Administration. 1 have already mentioned certain provisions pro posed by the Commission which would be administratively difficult, if not impossible. The following additional changes seem to me to be adminis trative impracticable.1. Article VIII of the orginal project gives the Ministry of Finance the choice, when receiving a tax-payment in foreign currency, to convert such currency into rials or permit it to be paid in foreign currency at the rate of exchange on the date the tax is due. I he same Article, as revised by the Commission, requires the Ministry of Finance to convert all income into rials, Obviously, the Ministry of Finance may at times need the foreign currency. 2. The original project provided ( Article XVII (c) ) that, in case a false declaration or false information is intentionally given the Ministry of Finance by a taxpayer, such taxpayer shall pay double the amount of underpayment, shall be prosecuted in the courts, and if found guilty, im prisoned for not less than one year nor more than five years. The commis sion proposes (Article X\I c) that a taxpayer guilty of fraud shall pay 3. In place of the Tax Appeals Commission proposed in Article XX of the original project, the Financial Laws Commission proposes a l ax Appeals Commission appointed or elected as follows and to act under the Presidency of the Governor: One member by the Financial Agent. by other departemental chiefs as determined by the Governor and the Financial Agent, by the Governor, by the taxpayer. by the trade union or class to which the taxpayer who appeals belongs. According to this proposal, a different commission would have to be established for each case, thus introducing inconceivable administrative difficulties. Furthermore, the Commission constituted as above would al most certainty decide in favor of the taxpayer in every instance. With such a Tax Appeals Commission, every taxpayer would be encouraged to appeal and thus delay the collection of his tax. In the end, the fair exe cution of the law and the collection of the Government s revenues would be rendered impossible. 4. The Commission proposes that the new law shall not apply to 1321 incomes. Other Changes. Other changes have been proposed by the Financial~ 11 — Laws Commission; but in some cases these present no difficulty and in other cases the differences between the revised and the original project ^ can probably be easily removed by discussion. Possible Bases of Agreement. During the time that this project has been under discussion, I have agreed to various changes in the project. Certain proposals made in the Financial Laws Commission have been wise and constructive, have been welcomed, and should be included in the law. 1. At the last meeting of the Commission which Mr. Robinson and 1 attended, we offered to accept a very substantial change in the project. Our offer was (1) to remove from the law Clause (a) of article XIV, which imposes an additional tax of 10 percent, the revenue from which would be paid to the municipalities, and (2) retain the 3°/ 0 tax until the end of 1323. This proposal, if accepted, would reduce the income tax on all taxpayers alike. At the same time, it should be taken into consideration that the abolition of the 3% tax will probably not result in any reduction of prices. In other words, the tax would continue to be collected from the consumer without any revenue accruing to the Government. The change proposed still seems to me to be reasonable and I am still willing that this change should by made. Its effect will be to reduce all income-tax rates by about 9 percent. 2. It is impossible to agree with the changes proposed by the Com mission with respect to exemptions and deductions. 3. Even if the Commission accepted the exemptions and deductions as proposed in the Government s project, it would still be impossible to accept the scale of rates proposed by the Commission. The rates so propo sed are unfair and will not meet the needs of the present emergency. 4. For administrative reasons, due to the delay that has occurred in the passage of this law. I am willing, it the law is a good one, to have its execution begin on first Farvardin, 1323, and not to have it apply to 1321 incomes. This concession is made most reluctantly, since it will permit many big profiteers to escape the taxes that they should justly pay and will also mean a serious loss of revenue at a time when the Government and the country need the revenue. 5. If the Maj 1 ess desires to relieve the rich of their just share of the tax burden, it can raise the rates on the lower - income and middle classes, so that these classes, will pay approximately at the present rate. If this is done, the law will not be, in my opinion, equitable; but, if the exemptions and deductions proposed by us are accepted, the law will produce an in-~n,e. f — 12 = crease of revenue and will exert an anti-inflationary influence. It will, however, be less equitable than the project proposed by the (rovernment and will contribute less to the redistribution of wealth and to social re- ^ forms. 6. With respect to the Tax Appeals Commission, I propose that the Commission be constituted of one member appointed by the financial Agent, one member appointed by the Chief Justice, and one member elect ed by the chambers of commerce or municipal councils, and that provision be made for an appeal either by the taxpayer or by the Ministry of Fi nance to the Finance Tribunal at Tehran. At the last meeting of the Financial Laws Commission that I atten- ted, 1 explained to the Commission the position that I would take if the Commission and the Majless insisted on a drastic reduction of the income tax rates imposed in this project on the higher incomes. I desire at this time to repeat and amplify these explanations. In the first place I want to say that 1 would be extremely reluc tant to leave Iran. I have many personal friends here. I have a genuine affection for the Iranian people. 1 like my w ork.I With the loyal and and efficient aid of my American associates and with the support and assistance of all Iranian and foreign groups, authorities, officials and employees, I firmly believe that this American Financial Mission will, in the end, achieve as great a success as the previous Mission that I had the honor to head. It is my conviction, however, that the passing of a good Income Tax Project is not only essential to our success but is also conclusive proof of what we may expect from the Majless in the future. The difference of views between the Financial Laws Commission and myself is not slight and inconsequential. It is a real, a wide, and a vital difference. If the Financial Laws Commission is right and I am wrong, then the Iranian Government should either get another Administrator Gen eral of the Finances, or dispense with this official altogether. The rejection of my advice in this instance would assuredly demonstrate lack of con fidence in me and would constitute a blow at the prestige of the American Financial Mission. Without confidence aud prestige, no one can work suc cessfully or happily. If the Majless should fail to pass the income-tax project or pass it with a significant raising of exemptions and deductions and lowering of rates, 1 would still be held responsible for the financial situation and for rising prices. U this vital project should not be passed, 1 could not assume Tax'Bill ^ ^ 0ri /l ^^. Tl^c Fl.A.'or, y J^ 5 mresponsibility either for the finances or for prices. My feeling is that when an official can not assume responsibility, he should resign. Finally, if Iran is to be governed by small privileged classes and if these classes are to be guided primarily by their own selfish interests, I have no desire to be their instrument and serve their shortsighted purposes. I am convinced that the project as prepared by us and accepted by the Government is for the good of the Iranian nation and the Iranian people. It demands no great sacrifice from the well-to-do or the rich. It is favored, I believe, by the vast majority of the people and by the most enlightened elements. If this majority and these elements can not make their view pre vail on an issue as clear as this, what hope can there be for the success of the American Financial Mission? Without hope of success, why should I wish to to stay? In closing, then, 1 appeal to the deputies of the Majless to renew their confidence, extend their support, and thereby prove their farsighted and impartial statesmanship as well as their sense of social responsibility. Grain and Bread. Providing for the food supply of the cities, especially the city of Tehran, is our most important and critical task. Because the grain and bread situation changes from day to day and because it is our intention to keep the Government and the public currently informed, it does not appear desirable to present detailed information in the present report. We do not desire to minimize the difficulties; but the harvest is abundant this year, the necessary quantity of wheat is in the country, and, if it can be collected and transported to Tehran, there will be no need of exceptional measures to assure an adequate supply of bread for the people. I believe that the organization of collection is working better. The stocks in the Tehran Silo are increasing. The transport problem will be dealt with in a separate section. The other problem for which the Soviet authorities are now helping us to find a solution is the problem of obtaining grain from the northern provinces—Azerbaijan. Gorgan and Khorassan. In Khorassan, the Governor-General has assumed complete responsibility for grain-collec tion and he has been informed that the city of Tehran must receive at least 18,000 tons of grain from that province. In Gorgan. it appears at pre sent that the required quota will be collected, provided no one except the Cereals and Bread Section is engaged in the direct purchase of grain. In Azerbaijan, the situation is not yet completely satisfactory, but, in view of the assistance that has been promised by the Soviet Authorities, for which weare fully appreciative, we believe that the required quantities will be avail able from that province. It goes without saying that we have been ready and willing to coop erate with the Soviet authorities in obtaining the grain necessary for local needs, for Tehran, and for the Soviet military authorities. We are appreciative of the assistance that the Soviet Union has extended to Iran in the past and we agree with the Iranian Government that Iran should extend all possible assistance to its Allies in the war. The Government and the public may be assured that we are conside ring and taking every practicable step to insure the food supply of lehran; and we are equally mindful of the need of improving the quality of the bread and the means of its distribution. T ransportation. In transportation, as in grain-collection, we have been seriously handicapped by lack of personnel to supervise and control operations, al though the Council of Ministers has assisted by approving the engagement of a number of additional men of American and Scandinavian nationality. While we are purchasing additional trucks, 1 do not feel that the country is seriously deficient in transport facilities. I he main problem is to im prove the efficiency of operations and to keep the existing facilities, both rail and truck, engaged in the carrying of essential goods. \\ hile the trans port of grain is a prior need, it must be remembered that the Road 1 rans- port Department as well as the Railway must transport also such essential commodities as coal, charcoal, petrol, sugar, tea, and cotton piece-goods, as well as materials and supplies for the Government and its industrial en terprises. 1 have established a Coordinating Commitee with authority to allocate transport facilities and thus regulate the movement of goods ac cording to priorities. The higher freight rates that are paid in the free market furnish a tremendous inducement to contractors and drivers to divert trucks from the carrying of grain and other essential goods. W e are taking steps to lessen this inducement and to institute more effective control of the trucks. The Government and the public will be informed of our action, as it is taken. t or the movement of civilian goods by rail from Persian Gulf ports,the British authorities have allocated to the Government of Iran a daily wagon capacity of 260 tons. Formerly the British Movements authority ^undertook to specify how the 260 tons should be used. As a result of dis cussions, the 260 tons daily capacity is now available for the movement of Government-owned and privately-owned goods as the Section of Price Stabilization may determine. Goods are scheduled for movement according to the urgency of the needs of the ultimate consumers. W hen priorities for the various classes of goods are established, priorities in allocating wagons are determined first by the relative urgency of the needs for Government owned goods and privately-owned goods of the same class and second according to the order in which applications for the movements of privately-owned goods of the same class are received. Prior to the time the Section of Price Stabilization waiwgiven con trol, the allotment of wagon capacity was never fully utilized and. there fore, there was no basis for supporting the claim for additional capacity. The daily loadings since 20 Mordad (August 12) have varied from the 260 goal but results are being achieved and with improved coordination of customs activities, the spotting of wagons for loading, actual loading, actual movement and unloading, it is confidently expected that the full capacity can be utilized and the organization perfected for handling more than 260 tons daily. Until the ability to use without delay' all wagons allocated has been demonstrated, there is no purpose in requesting additional wagons. With respect to the movement of goods by rail from the North, steps are being taken to comply with the requirements of the U. S. S. R. autho rities, in order that the maximum possible wagon capacity may be secured and utilized. l Arrangements are being made to provide adequate staffs at Persian Gulf Ports. When both Khorramshahr and Ahwaz are stalled with forward ing agents and assistants, it should be possible to load 260 tons daily, provided that wagons and labor are available and the personnel sufficiently experienced to arrange alternative loadings in the event of inability to ad- here to scheduled movements. The rate of clearing goods from the customs area exceeded the rate of arrival, which is satisfactory. The position of goods despatched from Portsbv rail to Tehran as at ill Shahrivar was as follows : (a) Received at Tehran ( ustoms (b) » » Silo {Flour) (c) Direct from port to provinces (d) In Transit Total During Shahrivar the only goods moved North by rail was 190 tons of sugar. The Government’s share of traffic from the North, including the Iran ian State Railway, amounted to an average of five daily which is not up to the 9 wagons daily allocated by the Soviet Military Authorities. During the month of Shahrivar 3988 tons of coal were brought to Tehran aecTTrding to information obtainable from Road Transport Department. The quantities hauled from the various mines were as follows: Kajere to Tehran 1814 Tons Kajere to Kara] Sugar Factory 46 3 &gt; Shimshak to Arms f actory 1369 &gt; Shimshak to Karisak Sugar f actory 75 » Nissa to Tehran 239 2 &gt; Zan Goleh 445 Total 3988 Tons The number of lorries employed totalled 275, but they were not work ing continuously. A total of 549 tons of Government charcoal was hauled from the Polesefid Bandar Gaz area during the month of Shahrivar by 231 vehicles, not working continuously. Approximately 20 tons arrived in 2 wagons by rail. 95 tons, 31 wagon loads of fire-wood for the Govermment, arrived from the Polesefid Bandar Gaz areas. Price Stabilization. The two chief problems of the Price - Stabilizaton Section relate to the preparation of requirements and the distribution of commodities. The pre- 1417 2521 146 1022 ons 5106 Tonsparation of requirements is under way, but has by no means been completed. Distribution is hampered by transportation difficulties. In all ways, the Price- Stabilization Section has been handicapped by lack of sufficient American supervisory officials. Improvements have been made in 1 ehran with respect to warehouses and stocks; and, as shown in the preceding section, progress has been made in the movement of goods from the ports. Automobiles. On 27 Tir, 1322, ihe Council of Ministers passed a decree establish ing the State General Supply Corporation, and in this decree placed all Government automobiles in the service of civil departments under the complete control of the State General Supply Corporation. I his action was taken because of the scarcity of automobiles and tires and because it was necessary, in order to obtain tires from the American Lend-Lease Adminis tration. to confine their use to essential purposes and prevent their waste. In the execution of this Decree, it has been necessary to depi i\ e many officials of the Government of cars that were formerly kept perma nently at their disposal, although essential transportation for such ollicials is still being provided to the greatest extent and with the utmost con's en- ience possible. In general, Government officials have accepted the restric tion in a spirit of cooperation. Lhey understand that we have had to send almost one-half of our cars to the provinces for wheat-collection and that the remaining cars must be centrally controlled in order to pre\ent chaos and paralysis in the Government’s operations. If all Ministries were to be left as before to determine how many automobiles they require, we would have chaos and paralysis and the most essential operations of the Go vernment, such as grain-collection, inspections, etc., would be left un provided for. Finance and Currency. The Majless has passed the Internal Loan Project, prepared and submitted bv us some months ago, and the I reasury General is making preparations for the issue of the bonds, which will provide an opportunity for safe investment, as well as an additional means of combatting inflation. The terms of the proposed stabilization agreement between ihe Ministry of Finance and the Banqe Mellie and the United States Ireasuiy— 18 — Department have been submitted to the Government, along with a project of law authorizing the signing of the agreement. As soon as the Income-tax project is passed, it is hoped that the stabilization agreement may be, concluded, thus assuring the financing of the Government during the present year. Provision is being made for the minting and issuance of small coins. Press Criticisms Recently, many of the newspapers have been printing articles about the American Financial Mission audits problems, which present the truth with courage, intelligence and wisdom: To these newspapers, 1 wish to express my appreciation. On the other hand, a few of the newspapers continue to print articles that are absolutely false and without any foundation whatever. Some of these articles have appeared in Mr. Movagher’s news paper, the Mehr-i-Iran. As a matter of public information, 1 may say that the Ministry ol Finance has a considerable claim against Mr. Movagher, who has not yet arranged for the payment of this debt. If he does not pay, it is our intention to prosecute him. along with all others who have debts to the Government, Personnel I he Majless has approved a credit of 500,000,000 rials for help to the employees of the Government; and regulations for the execution of the law were promptly prepared. 1 he Budget Commission and the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Majless have approved the project authorizing me to engage up to 60 Amer icans for the Financial Mission. Mr, Arthur S. Cann and Mr. Fred A. Shuckman have arrived from the United States. The former has been placed in charge of the procurement of civilian supplies in the Section of Price Stabilization and the latter has been appointed Administrative Assistant to the Administrator General of the Finances, being detailted temporarily to handle rationing matters. Mr. William I. Williamson and Mr. Stephen Nyman have been engaged with the approval of the Council of Ministers for service in the Road Transport Department. Col. Speaks arrived in Iran to take the position of Chief Adminis trator of the C ereals and Bread Section; but, because of a heart condition which was aggravated by the altitude, he was compelled to return to Amer-ica. Col. Speaks was entirely in accord with my policies; and his health was the only reason for his return. I deeply regret, also, that it has been necessary for Mr. Robinson to return, solely for reasons of ill-health. Mr. Robinson, as Chief Administrator of the Price-Stabilization Section, has rendered most valuable services, and his departure at this time will be a serious loss to the American Mission and to the Iranian Government. In closing this report, permit me to convey to Your Excellency the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. Administrator General of the FinancesREPORTS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR GENERAL OF THE FINANCES OF IRAN FOR THE MONTHS of TIR, and MORDAD 1322 23 June - 23 August 1943 His Excellency. The Minister of Finance. Your Excellency, I have the honor to submit herewith my report for the Month of Tir. 1322 (23 June —23 July, 1943). In my previous monthly reports, I have emphasized the general fea tures and the critical nature of the economic and financial situation of Iran. The situation remains extremely critical. In some respects it has become worse; in other respects, it is essentially the same; and, in still other res pects, it shows some improvement, or, at least, more encouraging aspects. Financial Position of the Government. Because of the chaotic condition in which we found the accounts and records of the Government, the almost complete lack of reliable financial statistics, and the neglect, up to our arrival, of any careful auditing of claims by and against the Government, it is impossible, even vet, to state precisely the financial resources of the Government. Under the circums tances, it has seemed wise to estimate with the utmost conservatism the revenues and collectible claims, while taking care not to understimate the expenditures of the Government. Since the submission of the 1322 budget to the Parliament, we have had to approve new, unforeseen and substantial obligations; for example, for the expansion of the armed forces, necessitat ed by disorder in the country. This same disorder, on the other hand, is a cause of unforeseen losses of revenue.Neverthless, the reports thus far received of revenue receipts during the first four months are by no means discouraging and certain large amounts due the Government and probably collectible have recently come to light. Increase of Salaries. because of the somewhat more favorable view that we can now take of the Government s financial position and because of the aid that we have received or expect to receive from the Allied Governments through advances and loans or through the payment of amounts owed by them, we have prepared a project of law, which has been submitted to the Majless, author izing the Ministry of Finance to expend up to 500.000.000 rials for help . to the employees wholly or partly in kind. Such help will do much, 1 am confident, to improve the morale of the employees, preserve their honesty, stimulate them to better work, increase revenues, and, in general, strengthen the Government. The employees will understand that help to all of them can not be given at once, in the same way, or in the same amount. To do so would perpetuate existing inequalities. When this project of law has been ap proved by the Majless, we shall start its execution without delay and we hope that in a short time, help may be given to all deserving employees and at the same time the compensation of employees in general be placed on a more equitable basis. Position of the American Financial Mission. Neither I nor my colleagues nor the American Financial Mission as a whole, nor, in fact, any administrative organization in this country, Ira nian or American, can work successfully unless certain conditions are fulfilled. These conditions are the following: 1. Adequate powers. In the financial sphere, substantial powers have been given me by the law of my engagement and, in the economic sphere, by the Law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322. Und er these laws, authority and res ponsibility are delegated by me to my American and Iranian colleagues. These powers should be sufficient, if other essential conditions are fulfil led. It will be necessary, however, in view of the complex and changing 1 situation with which we have to deal, to ask the Majless to grant in spe cific laws to the Government, to the Ministry of Finance, or to myself more discretionary authority than would be granted in normal times.2. Support from the Government. I lie Government, it is true, has not been, on the whole, unfriendly' and in many matters it has been markedly' cooperative. We appreciate these esidences of support. But, in these critical days, more is required. Having been given powers, we must be given the freedom and the means to exercise these powers. The Law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322, gives me wide and exclusive authority to decide certain matters. This law was enacted with the full approval and support of the Government. Presumably', authority was entrusted to me because of general confidence in my disin terested purposes, honesty' and ability. It should have been distinctly' un derstood, and I believe it was so understood, that I would exercise these powers for the benefit of the Iranian Nation and the masses of the people, disregarding the pressure of self-seeking politicians and the selfish interests of profit-seeking individuals and classes, and disregarding also the intri gues, propaganda, disturbances and clamor which are customarily' instigated by those whose interests are adversely affected by Governmental action. Obviously, we shall make some mistakes and we can not please every body. When 1 have reached and announced a decision under the authority gran ted me, it is quite clearly the duty of a strong and courageous Govern- ment to take one of three courses: ( 1 ) To give me full support, ( 2 ) to ask the Majless to curtail my powers, or (3) to request my resignation. In the recent past, I have reached and announced decisions after due deliberation and after listening to all shades of opinion. Yet, the Go vernment has failed to take any r one of the three courses of action men tioned above. Moreover, we can not take responsibility for the feeding of the peo- ple, for price stabilization, or for the financial administration unless the Government and the various Ministries give the needed assistance to us in specific cases. For example, in Azerbaijan, the most important grain-pro ducing province of Iran, the Governor-General and the agents of other Ministries have interfered in our work, held up transport facilities, and practically assumed responsibility for grain-collection and food supply. In Khorassan, the Governor-General has taken over the grain-collection work. practicaJly in its entirety'. In Tehran, the Municipality' has created diffi culties in our effort to obtain materials, in the possession of the Munici pality,’which are needed to complete the Government Store. The Ministry of Commerce aud Industry has delayed the transfer of activities and per-sonnel engaged in the control of imports and exports, a power given to me by the Law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322. 3. Support Ironi the Majless. 1 am not a dictator. No one can be a dictator who refuses, as I do, to interfere in politics, who has no control whatever over the armed forces, the courts and the press, who can neither make a payment nor create a debt without the approval of the Minister of Finance, and who acknowledges his obligation to obey the laws enacted by the Majless. During the recent clamor over Price Stabilization Regulations Nos. 14 and 15 I was charged with disregarding a law passed by the Majless. This law was in the form of a clause attached to the law granting a credit to the Ministry of Food for the purchase of grain. This clause reads as follows: I he food Ministry is bound, in all the regions where its branches exist, and as per the application of the applicants, to issue flour permits without asking (or coupons within the limiis of anti-Hoaring Law regula tion.” After approval of this credit, with the above clause attached, the activities of the Ministry of Food were transferred to my control, to be exercised under the Law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322. My interpretation was that this restrictive clause did not apply to me and that the Majless had no intention of amending or repealing the Law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322. If the Majless does not agree with this interpretation, it has only to make its meaning clear; but, when the Law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322, was under discussion, I took care to explain that I could not assume responsibility for price stabilization without the powers included in the Law. Since my position is not that of a dictator but of a public servant, I must ask the members of the Majless either (o discharge me or to give me a reasonable measure of support. We cannot work unless the Majless enacts without undue delay the projects of law that are essential to our success. Nor can we work if the deputies themselves encourage opposition and unrest or become our enemies whenever we refuse for administrative reasons their political and personal requests. The administrations under my supervision must be made increasing- ly free of political influences. Only when this is .lone will officials and employees give their full time and devotion to their work and their full loyalty to their administrative superiors.given to can be a 10 control n neither 3 Minister /s enacted tions Nos. e Majless. g a credit 3 reads as ; branches ir permits iw regula- ached, the trol, to be tation was ajless had teslit, 1322. y to make was under ponsibility ic servant, or to give he Majless dial to our opposition ainistrative increasing- fficials and :1 their full 1 hope that before this report is published, the Majless will have approved the Income Tax project and the Internal Loan Project. The first- named project is essential to the balancing of the budget, as well as to the combatting of inflation. The second-named project is both anti-inflationary and a means of financing the Government. 4. The landholders and the merchants must refrain from becoming the eneouragers and instigators of opposition and unrest. If they persist in opposing measures that are in the interest of the masses, they not only discredit and endanger themselves but seriously threaten the success ol our work. Their long-run interest lies in a patriotic willingness, already shown by some of them, to sacrifice immediate profits for the sake of the general welfare, security, and prosperity. 5. The newspapers must be honest with us. \\ e welcome their criti cisms and suggestions; but if they persist in creating popular misunder standing and unrest they make our work impossible. If failure results from their misleading propaganda, they must bear their share of the res ponsibility. Ultimately, they, too, are likely to suffer. 6. Order and security. At present, a state of rebellion in two large regions, and recurring disorder in other places, seriously reduce revenue recei pts and interfere with grain-collection. If rebellion and disorder spread, our work will become hopeless. In the budget of 1322, substantial financial assistance has been given to the Army, the Gendarmerie, and the Police. They, not we, are responsible for maintaining order. And the Government has the duty of adopting statesmanlike measures to remove the causes of unrest among the tribes. • 7. Cooperation and support from the Allied Governments. In pre vious reports, I have taken the liberty of indicating some of the ways in which these Governments can help Iran and help the American Mission to help Iran. At this time, three means of help may be emphasized: (1) Cooperation in clearing their financial accounts with the Iranian (.overn- ment and in paying as promptly as possible all of their legal debts to this Government; (2) cooperation in facilitating the collection and transpor tation of grain; (3) cooperation in the maintenance of strong and effective administration. 1 he latter means of help implies, in my opinion, that the organizations and agents of the Iranian Government must be free to lunc- tion in all parts of the country, in the collection of revenue, the purchase of grain, the supplying of food, and the execution generally of Iranianlaws. The Iranian Government can hardly be held responsible for failing to meet the demands of the Allied Governments unless the Allied authori ties cooperate with and assist Iranian officials and desist from interfering directly or indirectly with the administrative operations of the Iranian Government. 8. The American Mission must he adequately manned. The slow ness with which we have thus far made progress is largely due to the inadequate number ol Americans in the organizations under my direction. Without more Americans, we can not cope with the prevailing disorgani zation and corruption, with the demoralization of the Iranian officials and employees, and with the huge burden of work that has been loaded on our shoulders. After careful consideration, I came to the conclusion that we need at least sixty Americans in our organizations. With that number, we can have one American stationed in each of the provinces, several au ditors to assist in establishing control over expenditures and accounts, a proper technical staff for the Price Stabilization Section, the Cereals and Bread Section, and the Road Transport Department, and the needed assis tants for the Ministry of Finance itself. It is necessary also, 1 am conviced, that, after the Majless has ap proved the employment of these men and fixed the terms and conditions of their engagement, I should be left free not only to select them but also to engage them without further reference to the Government and the Majless. The names of these men can mean nothing to the Deputies; and the delays that necessarily occur when their names are submitted individually makes it practicallv inpossible to engage them with the neccessary promptitude. I he above are the conditions that appear to me now to be essential to our success. Unless these conditions can be fulfilled, the conclusion will be inescapable that our task is hopeless and should therefore be abandon ed. Personally, I should deeply, regret to have to come to such a conclu sion. Its effect on the welfare of the masses of the Iranian people and on the future of the Iranian Nation might be of the most serious nature. Cereals and Bread An important occurrence during the period under report was the transfer of the functions of the Ministry of Food to my control. This Mi nistry had been formed before my arrival in this country, at the time of an acute food crisis. The collection of grain and distribution of bread, until about a year ago, had been under the Ministry of Finance. After the se-paration of this work from the Ministry of Finance, numerous functions not properly related to food administration had been put under the Min istry of food as a matter of expediency. Moreover, the supply and prices of food commodities bear a very close relation to the supply and prices of non-food commodities. Thus, although I was reluctant to assume this added responsibility, I did so in the belief that the transfer would contribute to administrative efficiency. Mr. J. P. Sheridan, the American Adviser to the Ministry of Food, had already, for personal reasons, decided to avail him self of the clause in his contract permitting him to resign at the end of his first year; and his resignation had already been accepted by the Go vernment. He, however, agreed to be appointed by me as Chief Adminis trator of the newly established Cereals and Bread Section, so as to ensure continuity of work at this delicate time, and to stay in that appointment until 3 Shahrivar (August 26). Mr. Crawford, also an American citizen, has been temporarily engaged by decree of the Council of Ministers, and appointed Asstistant Administra tor of the Cereals and Bread Section. Col. Speaks, also an American, with previous experience in Iran, has been likewise engaged and has been ap pointed Chief Administrator. He is expected to remain for a considrable time; and, under his direction, with the temporary assistance of Mr. Craw ford, the work of grain collection and food supply should be adequately taken care of. Mr. Sheridan came to Iran when an acute food crisis had already developed. He was given no powers and was compelled to work under most difficult administrative conditions. Yet, with the help of the Allied Governments, the crisis was satisfactorily met. All the people were fed. The proper control of food prices, as I have intimated above, is a vital part of any effort directed towards the stabilization or lowering of the general price level. The transfer referred to was therefore both logical and desirable, in that it should enable me to control and coordinate more effectively all the important factors which determine the .cost of living. But the time at which this decision was taken was in some respects un fortunate. The process of collecting this year s harvest was just commencing, and a change in the central authority responsible for this collection might easily have produced a certain amount of uncertainty in the minds of the public and vacillation on the part of the provincial officials with disas trous results. I considered it necessary, therefore, to clarify without delay the position and the policy that 1 intended to follow. In times such as these, in respect of a commodity which forms thebasic diet of the nation, there can be but one policy; namely, to ensure that whatever is available is distributed at a price within reach of all and in a way by which everyone, whether he is rich or poor, gets his adequate and proper share. Fortunately, the present grain harvest is abundantly sufficient for the whole year. In fact it is our aim to collect enough to leave a reserve for the next year. But, however good or bad the harvest may be next year, every individual must be willing to be equally secure or equally short. Hence, unless or until the siocks are ample to supply food for all, it would be wrong for the Government to give permits to any individuals or groups to lay in private stores, merely because they are in a position to do so by reason of their wealth in cash or in land. The strongest motive behind the demand for “permits” is undoubted ly the desire for profit on the black market. Everyone knows the large gains made last year by unscrupulous people from the distress of their countrymen. 1 his state of affairs must be prevented from repeating itself. It was with this end in view that I declared wheat and barley to be a Government monopoly. But the end will be attained only if the monopoly is strictly and efficiently administered. To have a system of issuing “per mits” on a large scale would defeat the twin objects of getting in a maxi mum supply and ensuring everyone his just share; and would play into the hands of those people who are waiting for an opportunity to make illegitimate gains on a large scale, and who are unfortunately to be found in all countries and in all nations. It was in accordance with these principles that, when grain-collection and food distribution were transferred to my control, I issued Price -Stab- lization Regulations Nos. 14 and 15 (See Appendix). These regulations were concerned in part with administrative reorganization. All agencies and functions, except those relating to cereals (including rice) and bread, were assigned to the Price Stabilization Section, where they are now under the dirction of Mr. Robinson. I hese Regulations were concerned also with policies and procedures. As above stated, they declared a complete Government momopoly of wheat and barley, prohibited all sales of such grain except to the Cereals and Bread Section or with the permission of that Section and prohibited all transportation or movement of such grains within Iran except by permit from that Section. Grain transported without permit or sold in the free free market or hoarded is subject to confiscation. The Cereals and Bread Section was authorized, however, to sell wheat and flour to householders.ensure all and lequate idantly f- )ugh to harvest secure supply to any are in )ubted- e large »f their ; itself, o be a nopoly = “per- maxi- ly into ) make found lection -Stab- s were 3s and , were ler the idures. wheat Is and ted all permit ic free Bread olders. I he price of wheat and barley is to be lowered by one-third on 1st Azar, 1322 (November 23, 1943). The transportation of wheat and barley was also made a Government monopoly and placed under the sole jurisdiction of the Hoad Transport Department. Unfortunately, Regulations Nos. 14 and 15 were misunderstood, and, ***■ ' * in in part, the misunderstanding was deliberately instigated. To correct misunderstandings, I issued Price Stabilization Regulation No. 16 (See Ap pendix), and, with it, a statement to the press. From this statement I quote below: « r | lie householders who are accustomed to buying and storing a six- months’ or year’s supply of grain or flour constitute a very small mino rity of the people of the cities. They can now buy bread from the independent bakers. Nevertheless, I am told that they are in a state of anxiety; and I am therefore directing the Cereals and Bread Section, beginning on first Mehr, to sell to housholders grain or flour against their bread coupons. The quantities which can be thus distributed will depend in large part on the cooperation that we receive from the land lords, on the promptness and completness with which they fulfiill their engagements. «Some of the landlords doubtless desire to sell directly and freely to the householders. We offer the landlords a fair price for their grain. The Government monopoly, no doubt, will deprive them of an opport unity to make greater and unreasonable profits. But, at this time espec ially, they must subordinate their own privaie interest to the welfare of the masses. \\ e offer, after they have fulfilled their engagements, to buy their surplus and we are hoping to enter the next year with a substantial stock of grain as a reserve, for the purpose of guaranteeing the food of the masses and, incidentally, the special needs of the householders. As a convenience to the landlords, the Cereals and Bread Section is authorized to permit any landlord who resides in a city to import grain to meet the requirments of his family. «To the middlemen and speculators, whose buying and selling of grain in the black market has been one of the causes of rising prices, we have nothing to offer. Their only aim is profits to be gained at the expense of the consumers. «We have no intention of interfering with the peasants’ share or to pre vent movements of grain from village to village. Such transportation may be done freely without permits except where it occurs through a city,in which case a permit will be given. “We shall do our best to eliminate annoyances to the public caused by the inspection of vehicles and also to eliminate dishonest practices on the part of our employees. We hope very soon to provide better compen sation for Government employees, so that the temptation to indulge in dishonest practices may be, so far as possible, removed. “In addition to misunderstandings regarding the food program itself and the int rigues that have sought to take advantage of these misunder standings, 1 am told that there are two other principal causes of the pre sent unrest. One is said to be lack of confidence in the Iranian Govern ment and the other, lack of confidence in the Allies’policy with respect to purchasing and exporting grain. “So far my own powers are concerned and particularly so far as grain collection and food-distribution are concerned, 1 am expecting the full support of the Government and the Majless. With this support, I feel sure that the results will do much to restore the people’s confidence in their Government. “With regard to the Allies, I am confident that all of the Allied Go vernments, if they have not already done so, will take every appropritate step to reassure the people on the subject of purchasing grain. All gave substantial help last year in providing food for Iran. None of them, 1 am sure, will do anything to contribute to the creation of a shortage this year. 1 am satisfied that two of the Allied Governments have done and are do ing no buying or collecting of grain in Iran and have no intention of do ing any. Surplus rice is normally exported from Iran. A surplus exists this year and there can be no objection to its export. 1 understand that the Soviet authorities desire to buy a certain quantity of wheat and barley for their needs. 1 feel confident, judging by their past cordial relations with our food officials, that the Soviet authorities will prefer to buy Irom the Iranian Government and that, in any event, they will not expect to be supplied unless or until the grain necessary for the food of the people ol Iran has been collected by the Iranian Government. I feel, therefore, that suspicion or anxiety regarding the purposes ol the Allies has at present no foundation.” The public may be assured that we shall enforce these Regulations to the best of our ability, amending them when and as circumstances— 11 — may require, but not in response to self-interested pressure, clamor or in trigues. The work of surveying the harvest with the object of taking ‘Ta’a- hods' from landlords vas continued during the month of Tir. As the har vest is reached earlier in the southern and warmer areas of the country, this survey was also naturally more advanced in those areas. In fact in some of these areas grain had already begun to reach the Government be fore the end of Tir in satisfactory quantities, General reports had indicated for some time that the crop through out the country was good. But we are now in the fortunate position of be ing able to confirm this fact as a result of an official survey. The progress made in Khuzistan. bars, Bushir, Kerman and Sistan indicates that in each case the minimum targets set for these areas will be reached and probably exceeded. In Ahwaz the sale of bread at official price has already com menced, though initially certain elements attempted to create trouble. As the collection proceeds and at the earliest possible moment the Govern ment plans to start the issue of flour itself to bakers and to see that the bread is sold by them at the Government price in all towns. The public must realize that the people who have been making large profits from the sale of Tree bread, including the bakers, will try to dislocate these arrange ments, by attempting riots, spoiling the quality of the bread, and any other means they can think of. Any one who lends his ear to such elements is in effect clamoring — though possibly unknowingly — for more expensive bread. Road Transport Since the monthly report for Khordad, steps have been taken to place the Road Transport Department under my control; but, for the pre sent, the Road Transport Board possesses and exercises its supervisory functions as usual. Anticipating the termination of Mr. Birkle s contract and his depar ture, Mr. Vivien was appointed Acting Director of Road Transport. A project of law has been submitted to the Majless for authorization to pro vide the Department with a revolving fund of 30,000,000 rials. It is planned to place the Department on a profit-making basis; and it is expected that eventually it will not only pay for its equipment and operating expenses out of its receipts, but also return a substantial income to the Iranian Go vernment.r* ■ — a ^ Adiuinistrative Operations The various reports from the Administrations for the montli of Tir demonstrate, for the most part, commendable energy in administration, a praiseworthy purpose to carry out the general policies and instructions that have been communicated, and definite accomplishments in many directions. I regret that, because of the length already reached by this Monthly Re port, T cannot publish these reports in full. Excerpts from two of them may be of particular interest. The Administration of Accounts and Audits reports in part as follows: ^During Hr the first report was prepared showing by months for the remainder of the \ear the amount of cash which each agency estimated it would need for operations as well as estimates by agencies and months of the receipts which would be received. This was the first time we have been able intelligently to review, on the basis of estimates from all agen cies, the monthI) financial situation ol the Ciovernment. ihe report pro- \ ed io be of inestimable value in planning the measures which had to be taken for Tir and Mordad to meet the cash needs of the Government. The report will be prepared as of the first of each month and will be available for use in anticipating financial needs throughout the remain der of the year. «A11 agencies were requested to submit to the Ministry of Finance a statement showing all claims which the Iranian Ciovernment has against individuals, corporations, or other governments. In the case of the indivi dual claims exceeding 100,000 rials it was requested that complete details be given in order thaHhis Ministry could intelligently consider them. A Claims Section is being established to review these claims and, wherever possible and feasible, amounts owed by the Iranian Government to such individuals, corporations or governments will be offset against claims which the Government has against them. In order to aid in this important pro- blem the claims against the Iranian Government which had been included in the detailed estimates of the 1322 budget were deleted and are being submitted to the Ministry of Finance for rev iew, decision as to their vali dity, as well as possible offset as outlined above. After the above has been performed the resulting claims which must be paid will be included in a separate Claims Bill and submitted to the Majless for its considera tion and approval.» A portion of the Report of the Correspondence and Archives De partment is quoted below:— Vi — «Extreme care has been taken in the execution of work, the progress of which has become quite noticeable. «1. Letters are distributed within one day at the most. An urgent let ter is delivered to the addressee in the city whithin a maximum of one hour, and in Shemiran within two hours, and the receipt is reported. This is particularly noteworthy at a time where two-fifths of the couriers have been dismissed, Tn the past, with 25 couriers, there was a noticeable difference between urgent and ordinary letters. «2. 1 have prepared two registers for Section 3, one to be used for •circulation of work, and the other for items referred by the Minis ter or yourself to the Administrations. This will prevent correspondance by Ministries and private individuals asking for reply. The first register will show where the urgent and important matters as well as files have gone and upon reference to this register we shall be able to ascertain where matters have been held up. This will enable us to watch the progress of work, and if we find that a matter of importance has been held up in any one of the Departments we can make the relative Director-General responsible. «The second register will show in the morning of each day whether work referred to the Subject Administration or other Ministries have been carried out or not. If not, and the replies to your instructions have not been received on that day, the matter will be notified to the Administrations or Ministries concerned. ^Actually, for ordinary works 10 days and for urgent matters 5 days are given and in case your order holds a fixed date and the reply or report is not received on the required day, the relative Department is reminded and asked for a reply. «3. Regarding the dossiers, a very useful decision has been made, i. e. none of the sections are allowed to send a file which bears a letter to any of the Administrations, or interfere in asking or giving away the files. This work has been solely entrusted to the 1st Section, i. e. the Archives. In practicing this scheme, the Archives may always be able to know the whereabouts of the files, and even the person who holds it.» Personnel Changes. Since the Report for Khordad, various important personnel changes have taken place. The departure of Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Birkle and theappointments of Col. Speaks, Mr. Crawford and Mr. Vivien have already been mentioned. Following his resignation, Dr. Groseclose left for the Uni ted States. I he contracts of Messrs. Gzzard, Wiens, Hutchins and Soloman have been approved by the Council of Ministers. Mr. Ozzard and Mr. Wiens join the staff of the Road Transport Board, Mr. Hutchins is assigned to the Administration ol Accounts and Audits, and Mr. Soloman remains in the service of the Cereals and Bread Section.Because of my illness the preparation and publication of the above report for Tir has been greatly delayed. As a matter of fact, it covers a considerable part of our activities during the Month of Mordad. It has seem ed desirable, therefore, to add a brief report for the remainder of Mordad and the first ten days of Shahrivar. The major occurences that may be noted include the following: 1. The beginning of negotiations with the United States Treasury Department relative to a stabilization agreement between the Department on the one side and the Iranian Ministry of Finance and the Banque Mellia Iran on the other, under which, if the Majless grants the necessary autho- ization, we shall be able, unless wholly unexpected difficulties arise, to finance the Government during 1322. 2. Approval by the Financial Laws Commission of the Majless of the Internal Loan Project. 3. Di scussions with the financial Laws Commission of the Income lax Project. (Many members of the Commission have insisted on a drastic reduction ol the rates proposed by us. Such a reduction is impossible if the Government is to balance the budget in 1322, lighten the burden of taxation on the poorer classes, and combat the rising cost of living. The Commission linally agreed to prepare its report and let me see it and comment on it before its submission to the Majless.) 4. I he setting up of a commission to prepare the regulations under whch help will be given to the Government employees as soon as the re- relative law is passed by the Majless. 5. Progress in the formulation of a basic circular dealing with per sonnel matters. 6. Drafting of permanent rent regulations by the Price-Stabilization Section and discussion of these regulations with His Excellency, the Minis ter of Justice. 7. Transfer of money from His Imperial Majesty's trust-fund for the construction of water-works at Ahwaz. 8. Progress in the organization of the Price-Stabilization Section and the transfer of organizations dealing with Quotas and foreign trade con trol Irom the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to the Price-Stabilization Section.— 16 — 9. Active steps to expedite grain-collection and to improve the bread situation in Tehran, and inauguration of a census as the basis of a new coupon system and to make possible the sale of wheat to householders. 10. An arrangement under which the distribution of tires, in addi tion to the allocation of Government automobiles, will be the responsibility of the State Supply and Service Corporation. 11. Various major inspections and investigations in cases of alleged frauds. 12. Reorganization of the Khouzistan Agricultural Society. 13. Important personnel changes, including that of Mr. Le Count as Treasurer-General, Mr. Brinck as Acting Director of the State Supply and Service Corporation, Mr. Sahba as President of the Agricultural Bank, and Mr. Hadji-nouri as Acting Administrator of the Foreign Trade Control Division of the Price-Stabilization Section. 14. Approval by the Council of Ministers of the temporary employ ment of several additional Americans, an evidence of support and aid for which 1 am deeply appreciative. 15. Continuance of popular clamor, instigated by various elements and from various motives, accompanied by misrepresentation of my work and the work of my American associates, and having the effect of making our task more difficult. Permit me to close this Report, Your Excellency, with the renewed assurances of my distinguished consideration. Administrator General of the Finances. A. C.

Administrator General of the FinancesREPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR GENERAL OF THE FINANCES OF IRAN FOR THE MONTH of KHORDAD, 1322 23 May -22 June, 1943 His Excellency. The Minister of Finance. Your Excellency, I have the honor to submit herewith my report for the Month ol Khordad, 1322 (23 May—22 June, 1943). Since the submission of the report for Ordibehesht, the major prob lems that have occupied our attention are (1) the critical financial situation of the Government, (2) the preparation of the Government budget for 1322, and (3) the organization and administration ol Price-stabilization under the law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322. In close relation to these problems we have continued to give attention to the revenue system of the Govern ment, to the organization and personnel of the financial administration, and to the problems of other Ministries and Agencies of the Government in so far as these problems affect or are affected by financial administra tion and price-stabilization. Permit me at the start to point out a fact that Your Excellency fully recognizes bui perhaps is not recognized by all others, namely, that the solution of the major problems mentioned above is a highly complex un dertaking, demanding action, not only by the American Financial Mission and not only by the Ministry of Finance, but also by the other Ministries, by the Government as a whole, and by the Majless. In many important directions and in many fundamental ways, no progress can be made until laws have been passed by the Majless. Moreover, during the present emer gency, cooperation and assistance by the Allies is also necessary.Another fact, which I know Your Excellency fully appreciates, con cerns the urgency of action. A\ hen a Government has a deficit in its finan- cial operations, steps must be promptly taken to increase the revenues and eliminate waste in expenditures. Otherwise, the deficit grows larger and becomes more difficult to handle. \Y hen a Government is attempting to sta bilize prices, it can not afford to lose any time; because, as prices become higher, they become harder to control and, in turn, they make it more difficult to bring the budget under control and to cover the deficit. imru raci wmen seems worth me c ^ i.ppuiviniy smi... actions may be indispensable before ihe larger steps can be taken, Fo example, I have been criticized for slowness with respect both to the sta bilization of prices and the preparation of Ihe budget. It should be under stood, however, that an American Administrator General of the Finance: must work through an adequate number of American assistants. Of course lie will depend in the main on Iranian officials and employees; but, il the Iranian Government and people desire an American-directed financial administration, Americans must be given the authority and responsibility in various key positions throughout the organization. My American col leagues have been doing their best; but we have all been overburdened with work and necessarily have not been able to give personal attention to all important and urgent matters. Fortunately, the Majless has now approved ie engagement of six additional Americans for my staff. When they arrive, more rapid progress will be made. I have authority to select more mencan assistants and these also are urgently needed in order that he American financial Mission may assume its full responsibility in the solution of the larger problems and meet the expectations of the Iranian people. May I express the hope, therefore, that when the names of these additional assistants are presented to the Majless, prompt action may be On the basis of the budgetary requests that have thus far been pr sented and approved bv me we estim„*» il j- 1 Government i„ ' . nate the ord,nar y expenditures of tl vj vernnient in 1322 at about 3 ^97 71^ r; i r n . • , , , i8,o3 1 Kin Is. 1 hese expenditures r ;:cto , ':; ude w r::,:!,; 1 : r ern r’* ~ ciai — L -«« innate the ordinary revenues nf ihrv n 1,89079509ft Ri^lc ri • r , ,ues 01 t,lc Governmenta deficit for the current year in the ordinary operaiions of the Govern ment amounting to about 1,406,923,441 Rials. In the operation of the com mercial enterprises, including the factories and the activities carried on by the Ministry of Food, we can not at the present time foresee either a cash surplus or a cash deficit, although stocks of goods will be on hand at the end of the year valued at a very substantial sum. The deficit for all govern mental operations is therefore estimated at 1,406,923,441 Rials. These figures do not include any estimate for general increases of salaries. All agree that such increases are absolutely necessary to extend law and order in the country, to restore efficiency and honesty among the employees, and to insure the collection of the revenues, on which the so lution of the financial problem ultimately depends. An increase of only 50 per cent in the present salaries will require an additional expenditure of about 500.000,000 Rials. Adding this figure, we estimate a total deficit for the year of about 1.900,000,000 Rials. This amount can not be obtained by the Iranian Government either by taxation or by internal borrowing. If prices can be stabilized, we hope that next year the budget can be balanced by reduction in the budget, and by an increase of tax reven ues and of income from the commercial enterprises and factories. Of the tax projects that have been or will be submitted to the Majless the most important is the income-tax project. We are unable to make any estimates of the revenue from the new income taxes, because we do not know when or in what form the law will be passed. If it were passed promptly, essen tially as submitted, it would take a considerable time to get the law into effective operation. A complete reorganization of the Internal Revenue Ad ministration both at the center and in the provinces is first necessary. Such a reorganization can not be completed in a day. The power of the Government to borrow from the Banque Mellie is now practically exhausted. The Government owes the Bank an amount of about 3,200,000.000 Rials, most of which was borrowed in previous years. Up to about seven months ago, when an Act was passed by the Majless requiring 100 per cent reserve for the notes issued, the only condition for government borrowing from the Banque Mellie was the approval of the Majless, and the only limit to the Banks lending power was the amount of printed notes held by the Bank. Since the passage of that Act, theBanks power to lend to the Government is limited entirely to the Bank's own resources. These resources are not now sufficient to meet any part of the expected deficit. Of course, I am not suggesting that the above - mentioned Act should be repealed. In my opinion, the Act is necessary to maintain the sound ness of the currency. Some relief may be obtained by means of internal borrowing through the sale of Treasury bonds. An internal-loan project was submitted to the Majless some weeks ago. It is hoped and expected that, by the time this report is published, the project will have been passed. It is certain, however, that the deficit can not be covered, except in small part, by bor rowing from the public. A deficit does not appear suddenly at the end of the year. An an nual delicit takes the form oi monthly delicits. So far as current expen diture and current income are concerned, we have had a deficit at the end of each month of this year. I he problem of financing grain-purchases is a most urgent one and has received appropriate attention. Under the plan of grain purchasing that has been adopted by the Ministry ol Food, that Ministry requires a revolving fund of 500,000,000 Rials. At the end of Khordad no means of borrowing more than a small part of this amount was in sight. In the presence of the grave emergency created by the financial situation, we took action along three lines. We approached the Anglo-Ira nian Oil ( ompany with a view to obtaining advances on the oil royalties payable in 1322, such advances to be used to cover the deficit in Tir and Mordad. The Company promptly agreed to make the advances. We propos ed to the Iranian Government that it ask the Allied Governments for an ad\ance of 500,000,000 Rials to finance grain - purchases. Further, we re commended that the Government seek a loan from the outside sufficient to repay the above advance of 500,000,000 Rials and to cover the total de ficit of 1322, including provision for such general increases of salaries as may be necessary to restore strength and efficiency to the governmental administration. I hose who read my monthly reports will notice that the figures presented by me are changed somewhat from month to month. They are still subject to revision. The budget itself is not yet approved by the Maj less;and, for this and other reasons, ii is impossible to make an exact es timate of expenditures. At the present time and under present circumstan ces, it is equally difficult to predict receipts. Nevertheless, the gloomy out lines of the financial picture can be seen with essential, if approximate, clarity; and the picture is not likely to show any substantial alteration for some time. Of course, if help from the outside is given, we shall be in a position to plan and work on a surer basis with the hope and purpose of balancing the budget in 1323. The Govern me nt Budget. At least a year’s experience in the execution of a budget is required for its intelligent revision. \et the preparation of this years budget was thrust upon us as soon as we arrived. t he work was complicated by the rise in prices that had occured, by the need of eliminating many waste ful and unnecessary expenditures, and by the necessity of postponing outlays on construction and other postponable items. 1 take this occasion to express my appreciation of the work done in this connection by Mr. Shambarger and his Iranian associates in the Administration of Accounts and Audits. Except for two or three of the Ministries none of them, when pre senting their budgets, had decreased personnel and as a matter of fact a number of the Ministries requested increases in the number of personnel. Many Ministries recommended new activities or extensions of present ac tivities with little regard to the increased price level or the possibility of obtaining required materials. Many budgets were reduced by large percentages below the amounts requested; but, due to the increased price level, it was neccessary in most cases to allow an increase over the budget of 1321. With respect to those objects of expenditure affected by increased prices we used a uniform percentage for all Ministries in allowing the 1322 amounts as compared with 1321. To facilitate the Ministries in making later adjustments in their budgets a clause is being included in the budget project which will allow the Ministries to transfer between articles within a prescribed percentage. Construction items were reduced to a minimum and all construction allowances are being consolidated into one amount to be used during the year only in those cases where the completion or partial completion of some construction is absolutely necessary. At the time of writing, the budgets of the various Ministries have• ' 1M j G — not been completed and the figures of expenditures authorized for l;}22 can not be finally stated. I wish to state my views on two or three points that seem of special interest. first, it will be clear from the tentative figures already given above that it is impossible to provide this year for any large increase of expen diture for the development of agriculture, the expansion of health facili ties, or the extension of education. Something will be done along all of these lines: but expenditures this year for economic development and social welfare must be kept at a minimum. We must think now solely of maintaining the governmental organization as it is, preserving order in the country, and providing for the collection and augmentation of the Go vernment s income. Attention must be concentrated now on meeting the financial emergency and preserving the fundamental conditions of future progress. In the future, and I hope that this future will not be far distant- we shall plan and strive for a reduction in those budgets which now seem excessive, for the increase of expenditures on irrigation, health and education, and for the enactment and enforcement of sound social legisla tion, including workmen’s insurance and some form of health insurance. Let us hope, too, that we may abolish once and for all child labor in the factories, provide a proper diet and healthful housing for both factory workers and peasants, and enable the peasants to own the land on which they toil. It is a tragic misfortune that the country should have to postpone the achievement of these objectives, on which His Imperial Majesty and the people have so wisely and sincerely set their hearts. Price — Stabilization. I nder the direction of Mr. Robinson, Chief Administrator, satisfac tory progress has been made in the organization and administration of the Section of Price Stabilization. He has a task of the utmost magnitude and difficulty and he has been greatly handicapped by lack of American assistants. In general, a measurable stabilization of certain prices has already been accomplished; or, to put it more conservatively, the rise in certain prices has been checked or slowed down. Evidently, speculation has lessened to a market extent; and we have fioted a more general diposition on the Part of business-men to return to normal practices and to the expectation of normal profits. On the whole, we can say that the psychological fac tors in inflation have changed for the better. tr\I he Pharmaceutical institute is in operation. The Government store near the Banque Mellie is nearly ready for business and stocks are being z-s moved in. 1 lie Cotton Piece-goods Department lias been transferred from the Ministry of food to the Price Stabilization Section. Progress has been made in the handling of the large consignments of goods in the customs warehouses. Steps have been taken toward a better control o! the move ment of goods. Attention has been given to the preparation and coordina tion of requirements. I he proposed Supply and Service Corporation, when established, will provide a means of coordinating governmental require ments and procurements, as well as controlling governmental supplies and property. Moreover, we are ready to cooperate with private merchants in order that, so far as may be practicable, they may continue import and export trade at a fair profit. The permanent rent regulations are under preparation. I he Section of Price Stabilization has wisely undertaken and, it is believed, has successfully achieved a reasonable and necessary measure of control over Government and private automobiles, including accessories, parts and tires. The aims of this measure were (1) to conserve essential transportation facilities in a time of increasing scarcity, (2) to facilitate increased purchases of automobiles and tires by giving assurance that such purchases will be used for essential purposes, and (3) to provide the Go vernment with the automobiles and tires that it needs for its essential opera tions. Due to lack of transportation, many operations of the Government have been seriously delayed and hampered and some have been practically paralyzed. These include such vital work as grain-collection, opium collect iou, and combatting locusts. Long delays have occurred in the sending of officials to their posts and it has been practically impossible to make any inspections outside of Tehran. The damage that has occurred is incalculable, measured by losses of revenue, waste in expenditure, disorganization, and demoralization. A strict control and reasonable distribution of automobiles and (ires arc clearly in the public interest. Price Stabilization Regulations Nos. 9-12 are printed as annexes to this report. We have never maintained and do not believe that the Section of Price Stabilization can alone stabilize prices. Emergency taxation and internal borrowing are necessary. Both are provided for in pending pro jects. In addition the Government is selling silver and the Imperial Bank of Iran is preparing to do so. Both the Iranian and British Governmentshave imported gold for sale in this country. These sales are to he handled in cooperation by the Banque Mellie and the Imperial Bank of Iran. The latter Bank has agreed to limit its profit on the sale of its silver and to hand over to the Iranian Government whatever proceeds may be in excess oi the limits agreed upon. We cordially appreciate this action. We hope to be in a position soon to mint and issue small coins to meet the existing shortage. Reorganization.- In the Ministry of Finance an Administration of Industrial Supervi- sion has been established. Its general function is to handle all those mat ters relating to the factories and mines which come within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of finance or within my jurisdiction under the law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322. Dr. Atkins has been appointed Director-General of the new Administration. Considerable attention has been given to the Road Transport Depart ment and some progress has been made toward its reorganization. We also have in view the reorganization of the administration of the Agricultural Bank. We have kept in increasingly close touch with the operations of the Ministry of Food, t hese are of interest to us because of the large expen ditures involved, the effect of food prices on the general price level, and the relation of food supply to the fundamental condition of the country. In closing this report, 1 wish to convey to Your Excellency the re- newed assurances of my highest consideration. A.

Bank Melli IranREPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR GENERAL OF THE FINANCES OF IRAN FOR THE MONTH of ORD1BEHESHT, 1322 22 April-22 May, 1943 His Excellency. The Minister of Finance. \ our Excellency: 1 have the honor to submit herewith my report for the Month of Ordibehesht, 1322 (22 April —22 May, 1943). The economic situation of Iran and the finanial situation of the Government remain extremely critical. Three fundamental problems demand solution: (1) the problem ol lowering or stabilizing prices; (2) the problem of the governmental deficit; and (3) the problem of governmental person nel, a problem that involves the strength and efficiency of the Government itself. Price Stabilization. The Majless enacted on 13 Ordibehesht (4 May) a law vesting broad powers in myself for the control of non-food commodities and the stabliza- tion or lowering of the prices of such commodities. The responsibility for the control of foodstuffs remains with the Ministry of Food. The Law of 13 Ordibehesht is not merely a price-fixing law in the narrow sense; it also provides for the control of the actual goods, their procurement, transporta tion, storing, and distribution. The law also provides for the control of rents, wages, and charges for other services. (The text of this law was printed as an Appendix to my report for the Month of Farvardin (22 March- 21 April). Luder this law we had issued, up to 29 Khordad (20 June) eight ■kM— A 2 regulations (See Appendix A of this report) These Regulations set up the administrative organization for price - stabilization, regulate the method of fixing the requirements of foreign governments for local purchases in Iran establish a general classification of commodities, specify the non-food Stabilization and are declared to be government monopolies, lay down rules governing the import and export of non-food commodities, and freeze rents as of 1 Esfand, 1321 (February 20, 1943). With respect to requirements, it is our purpose to establish organiza tion and procedure that will properly determine Iran's needs, appraise and coordinate the requests that come from various quarters for imported goods, and submit to the Combined Supplies Committee in Iran and through it to the Middle East Supply Center at Cairo a properly prepared and ade quately supported statement of what this country needs and what it would like to have imported. Requirements fall into three classes: (1) general civilian, (2) industrial, and (3) governmental administrative. All requirements will be centralized in and coordinated by the Requirements Division of the Section of Price Stabilization. Governmental administrative requirements must be centralized before they can be intelligently handled. To centralize the handling of such requirements and to control governmental supplies after they are re ceived, we have proposed that the Administration of General Supply of the Ministry of Finance be changed into a General Supply and Service Cor poration. A decree with this object in view has been prepared. An im portant aim of this proposed decree is to centralize the control of the Go vernment automobiles. Such centralization is absolutely necessary to pre vent waste in the use of automobiles and tires. At the present time, vital operations of the Government such as grain - collection, opium - collection, combatting locusts, and inspections, are seriously handicapped by the lack or improper distribution of Government automobiles. What can be imported into this country depends, of course, on the shipping space that the Allies can make available after providing for the necessities of the war effort and with due consideration of the needs of other Middle Eastern countries. We feel confident that the Allied Governments and their subsidiary supply organizations will give sympathetic considera tion to the requirements of this country; and we shall be constantly seeking their advice in the task of determining requirements. commodities that are brought under the control of the new Section of Price\\ 6 have also taken steps to effect a better control over the movement of goods within the country; and it is evident that the responsibility vested me by the Law of 13 Ordibeshesht requires a complete and effective control of exports. A\ e have no objection to the export of surplus com modities—in fact we are in favor of such exports; but we do object to the exportation of commodities, with respect to which a shortage exists in the country. Should such commodities be exported, we should be placed in the position of asking the Allies to provide shipping space for the replacement of such commodities or for the importation of substitutes for them. For example, on the ground that necessary work cattle have been exported from the country, we are now asked to approve an application for the importation of tractors. I he Price Stabilization Law audits execution can not be expected alone to lower or stabilize prices. We have therefore proposed and the Government has approved several projects designed to reduce purchasing power by reducing the amount ol bank notes in circulation. The Allied Governments and the Imperial Bank of Iran are also cooperating to this end. I hese measures have been referred to in preceding reports. Among them, the Internal Loan Project (See Appendix B of Report for Farvardin) is considered to be both necessary and important and we anticipate that it will be passed by the Majless at the earliest possible moment. As a means of lowering or stabilizing prices, the income tax project now pending in the Majless isof major importance It will have the effect of drawing off a substantial portion of the excess purchasing power now pressing on the market. It will also eventually provide the Government with funds to cover the deficit, which is now so large that it threatens the stability of the. Government itself. 1 he income-tax project, furthermore, is a part of the plan for financing the increase of the salaries of Government employees. I inally. this law, when enacted by the Majless, will take away some of their ill-gotten gains from the profiteers and speculators who have grown rich at the expense of the masses, and will help to bring about in Iran a more just distribution of wealth. Although the rates of taxation prescribed in the income-tax project are low compared with those that are imposed in otht'r countries, this project when presented to the Majless w as greeted with a storm of criticism and opposition. Lvery attempt w r ill doubtless be made to misrepresent this project and mislead the people with regard to its effects. If an organizedcampaign develops against this project, the people should understand quite clearly the sources of the campaign and the selfish motives of the instigators. The Governmental Deficit 4 Let me turn now from the problem of price-stabilization to the prob lem of the governmental deficit. Price-stabilization is, of course, a means of stabilizing the budget — preventing it from growing larger — because the chief justification for increases in governmental expenditure is found in the increased cost of supplies and equipment and in the need of adjusting salaries to the cost of living. Faced with decreased revenues, this Ministry asked the Council of Ministers and the other Ministries several weeks ago to bring about a re duction in the ordinary budget of the Government of about 600.000,000 rials. Such a reduction, if had been promptly achieved, would have improved the situation by making possible increases of salaries to the necessary and useful employees who remained in the service. 1 he morale of the empolyees would have been improved and the various Ministries would have been working more efficiently. The result would undoubtedly have been further savings and elimination of waste and a substantial increase of revenue. When this report is published, we shall have probably completed our examination of the budgets of the various Ministries; and, it is hoped, the whole budget of the Government will have been submitted to the Majless. We have no criticism to make of the various Ministers who have asked for increases in their budgets; we realize the need of new or expanded items that some of them have recpiested; and we deeply regret that the financial situation of the Government prevents immediate approval of various projects of a constructive and humanitarian character, particularly those relating to health, education, agriculture, and irrigation. In general, the difficulty of reducing governmental obligations has three causes: (1) the rise in prices during the past year, (2) the natural reluctance of high officials to dismiss employees during a disturbed period, and (3) the necessity of assuring the living of the needy employees who are dismissed and increasing the salaries of the necessary employees who remain in the service. We have felt compelled to approve an increase for the Ministry of War of 300,000,000 rials. This increase is largely explained by the increased cost of supplies and by the need of raising the pay of the soldiers. While l do not have exact figures, my rough estimate is that the Government is now incurring a deficit in its ordinary expenditures ofat least SOO,000,000 rials. It is evident that, if present conditions continue, we shall he unable to pay this year a considerable portion of the Go vernment’s ordinary obligations. I he I reasury-General reports the income and expenditure of the first two months of 1322. as compared with the same period of 1321, as follows: 1-J21 1322 Increase 1 ncome 309,358,191-15 315,036,872-35 5,678,681 -20 Expenditures 396,699,977 442,912,256-35 46,212,279-30 I he situation regarding extraordinary expenditures to be met by borrowing is also extremely critical. We can borrow this year from the Banque Mellie an amount of not more than 500.000,000 Rials. We had already borrowed at the end of Ordibehesht for the purchase of cotton and for the Ministry of Health 57,500.000 Rials, leaving an amount of 442,500,000 Rials. 1 he purposes of borrowing and the net requirements for money to be borrowed for revolving credits are shown below: PURPOSES NET REQUIRE Ministry of Food 500,000,000 Price Stabilization 90,000.000 Opium Collection 107.000,000 Khouzistan Agricultural Society 100,000.000 Ministry of Commerce and Indu stry 38,600.000 Veramin Sugar Factory 20,000,000 TOTAL 855,600,000 RIALS. Rials To provide this amount in revolving funds we had a borrowing capacity of only 442,500,000 Rials. It should be understood that the above figure represents the amount required for revolving funds to conduct these commercial operations. It is not the estimated deficit in these operations. We have allocated our borrowing capacity to those obligations that seem most urgent and essential; and we find ourselves unable to assure the financing from our own resources of a large part of the requirements of the Ministry of Food, of a part of the Pric e Stablization program, of lend-lease purchases from the United States Government (which the Iranian Government has been expected to pay for on delivery), of the Khouzistan Agricultural Society, of the munitions factories transferred from the Minis try of War to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, of the project forrehabilitation of the \ eramin sugar factory, and of any new obligations that may later be presented to us for payment. Ceriain of these obligations which we are now unable to finance we hope to take care of, at least part and for a time, with the cooperation of the Allied Governments ana the Imperial Bank of Iran. The Government of Iran does not wish to es cape any of its justified obligations; but it is imperative that as many as possible be postponed. The amount that is necessary to meet the present obligations of the Government, both ordinary and extraordinary, may be estimated as at least t.000,000,000 rials, in excess of the expected revenues and of borrowings from the Banque Mellie. Hence, it is absolutely necessary and extremely urgent that the incomme-tax project, as well as other tax projects that may be later proposed, should be enacted by the Majless. Only through taxation can the Government tide the country over the present critical situation and lay the basis for a balanced budget in the future. With regard to increasing the Government's income from sources other than taxation, the most logical and necessary measure was to increase the price of bread. This has been done by the Ministry of hood with the per mission of the Council of Ministers and w 7 ith my approval. The decision was not a pleasant one to take; but if it had not been taken, it would have been impossible to continue the grain collection program and thus assure food to the people in the future. Governmental personnel. Let us turn now to the third fundamental problem, that of govern mental personnel. 1 he situation of government employees, particularly the insufficiency of their salaries, presents a problem of immediate and pres sing importance. The situation is now so bad that it threatens the stability and strength of the Government including our efforts to place the finances on a sound basis and to stabilize prices. Lntil prices are stabilized it would be useless and in fact harmful to give a general increase of salaries. Such an increase would lead im mediately to an increase of prices, as it has led on previous occasions. The employees would be no better off than before. 1 lie general public would be worse olf; and our effort to stabilize prices would be rendered more difficult. Numerous proposals have been made that assistance in kind should be extended to the employees. This form of assistance was recommendedby a special commission of Under-Secretaries. The Commission recommen ded, in brief, that essential goods should be supplied to the employees at Aow prices through government stores. It is our purpose to establish go vernment stores for the distribution of essential goods. These goods will, of course, be available for purchase by the employees. This system of distribu tion will be organized and put into operation as quickly as possible: and it is evident that the Government should not undertake to establish and oper ate two systems of stores. Unfortunately, this system of distribution can not be put into opera tion immediately; and, therefore, it does not offer a means of quick relief for employees, f urthermore, my opinion is that it will not, in any event. pro\ide adequate and equitable relief for all employees. To give such relief in an equitable manner, the most deserving groups of employees should be given cash allowances, which the employees may spend according to their individual needs. Later, after prices have been stabilized, general increases should be gi\ en, provided funds are available. \\ e have in view, therefore, two distinct steps in the granting of help to the employees: (1) Cash allow ances and (2) adjustment of salaries. Lack of revenue to meet the ordinary expenditures of the Govern ment, combined with our exhaused borrowing capacity, will make it im possible for us to pay all of the expenses of the Government. We may be compelled to leave a considerable part ot these expenses unpaid. Under the circumstances, any additional grants or increases paid to the employees will mean simply that more of the employees will have to be left unpaid, belief to the employees depends on obtaining more income for the Govern ment . ( losely connected with the question of increases of salaries is the question of the overstaffing and waste that now exists in the Ministries. I he budgets must be reduced to the absolute necessities. This action is necessary for three reasons: (1) because reduced spending by the Govern- ment is anti-inflationary; (2) because the Government can not function efficiently so long as employees are kept in their jobs on the basis of need and not on the basis of merit; and (3) because it would be financially wasteful, unjust, and demoralizing to give help or increases to all imploy- ees, including those who are unnecessary and useless. When these employ ees are dismissed, the Government will have to sec that they do not starve and will have to try to find other work for them, but it is not possible to* — 8 — keep them in Government jobs and- give them help orincreases along with the employees who are necessary and are doing good work. My conclusion is that, before any immediate help can be given t** the employees, it will be necessary for the Ministries to cut out all un necessary, useless, or postponable expenditures. When this is done and the budgets of the Ministries are approved by the Ministry of Finance and the Council of Ministers, l shall be willing to approve that the amounts rep resented by the expenditures so eliminated shall be used for giving help to the employees who are retained in the service. With regard to later and permanent increases of salaries, we must wait until the means of financing are assured. Otherwise, we shall merely find ourselves in the position of increasing salaries and then being unable to pay them. Furthermore, we must not deal with such increases as a matter of aid or relief but rather as a matter of giving employees their rights to just compensation according to their grades and the quality of their services. I have spoken above of the natural reluctance of high officials under present conditions to dismiss employees, even though they may be unneces sary. Certainly, employees can not be turned out to starve; but the matter of relief to persons in need must be separated from the matter of govern mental employment. If persons are employed or kept in employment because they are in need, the result will be continued inefficiency, a continued and mounting deficit, and a total failure to solve the problem of personnel, which, as I suggested in the beginning, involves the strength and stability of the Government itself. The Ministry of Finance has established in the Administration of Personnel a Reemployment C ommission. This Commission has for its duty(l) the finding of work for dismissed employees of the Government and (2) executing the measures that may be approved by the Ministry of Finance for helping those dismissed employees who can not find work. Any person, company, or organization in Iran who desires to employ additional persons is urged to notify the Reemployment Commission or myself of such op portunities for employment. The representatives of the Allied Governments in Iran are especially invited, if and when they are in need of additional employees, to give an opportunity to those dismissed employees of the Government who possess the requisite qualifications. Cooperation in finding work for those dismissed employees is one means of helping the Iranian Government out of its present critical situation.Other means hy which outside agencies may help the Government are (1) to refrain from accepting for employment any employee of the Go vernment without the approval of the Ministry or administration in which such employee is working; and (2) to refrain from paying wages above the present general wage scale of the country. Many of the good employees of the Government have left the service to take outside jobs. Others have threatened to strike because of the insuf ficiency of their salaries. The Ministry of Finance has endeavored to make its employees understand that we thoroughly sympathize with them and are doing everything possible to relieve their situation. I he Ministry of finance is largely responsible for collecting and controlling the funds out of which salaries are paid. To increase salaries it is necessary to increase these funds. If employees leave work or strike, they hurt both the Go vernment and themselves. 1 hough the conditions under which these employ ees work are well - nigh intolerable, it is their duty to continue to work faithfully, efficiently, and honestly. By so doing, they will help us to help them. It is impossible to select any one class of employees and give them help, without at the same time giving help on the same basis to all classes of employees. Least of all can we give an increase of salary to employees who have gone on strike against the Government, as a condition of their going back to work. To do so would be to reward those who have refused to help the Government and their country at a most critical time. Such action would encourage strikes among other classes of employees. Those who strike do not deserve an increase of salary; they deserve instant and permanent dismissal from the service. Reorganization. Since my last report further progress has been made in the reorgan- iztion of the financial administration. A Department of Correspondence and Archives has been established, separate from the Minister s Cabinet. The Department of Information and Sta tistics has been abolished and the statistical function transferred to the De partment of Correspondence and Archives. The Mint has been placed under the Treasury General. The Department of Government and Municipal Pro perties and the Department of Miscellaneous Goods have been transferred to the Administration of General Supply. As above stated, a project has been prepared changing that Administration into a Supply and Service1 — 10 — Corporation. A considerable internal reorganization in the Administra tion of Accounts and Audits is being carried out under the direction of Mr. Shambarger. Progress can be reported in the organization of a statist^ cal system. Attention has been given to the organization, as well as the ad ministration, of the Agricultural and Industrial Hank, the Kdiouzistan Agri cultural Society, the Khorassan Agricultural Society, and the Road Fransport Department. A commission has been formed to study the finance High School and make recommendations regarding it. I he biggest organizational job of all, that concerned with price stabilization, is going forward under Mr. Robinson, who has been appointed C liief Administrator of the Section of Price Stabilization. Asa part of this reorganization, the Foreign Transac tions Department, formerly in the Ministry of food, has been transferred to the Section of Price Stabilization. Administration It is impossible in this report to review, except in the most general way, the significant actions that have been taken in the various adminis trations. The following, taken from the reports of the administrations, are called to Your Excellency's attention. Under Mr. Manoocherian s direction commendable progress has been made in the Administration of Personnel with reference to the handling of numerous arreared dossiers and the preparation of fundamental projects. The Administration of General Supply, under Mr. Robinson, has made progress, despite extraordinary difficulties, in locating and handling the movable properties of the Government and in putting the procurement, cus tody, and distribution of supplies on a sound basis. This Administration has devoted considerable time to the temporary conversion of one wing of the new Finance building into an emergency typhus hospital, to the improve ment of the bread service of the Ministry of Finance, and to the obtaining of automobiles and tires for use in the collection of grain and opium. The Administration of General Inspection is being built up under the direction of Mr. Xelli. its work is of major importance and, I am con fident, will be increasingly useful. It has already conducted a number of important inspections. Thorough investigations will be made in the provinces as soon as transportation means are available. The work of the Administration of Internal Revenue is at this time peculiarly vital to the solution of the country’s problems. Under the direc tion of Mr. Robinson and, more recently that of Mr. Nariman, this Admin-istratiou has prepared the income-tax project and is studying and preparing other tax proposals; regulations have been issued governing the collection W the 3°/ 0 tax; instructions have been issued regarding the municipality taxes; steps have been taken to safeguard the revenues from alcoholic be verages; through the Department of Mines and Concessions, the Adminis tration has cooperated in the improvement of the distribution of petroleum products. In this connection we may express our gratification over the ar rangements that have been made with the Anglo-lranian Oil Company, whereby the Government will receive this year a sum of £ 4,000,000 as roy alties. The Administration of Tobacco and Opium Monopolies, now under the direction of Mr. Nikpai, has taken effective steps to reduce administra tive expenses, to encourage tobacco cultivation, to obtain more revenue from tobacco products, and to increase the collection of opium and thus augment the revenues while reducing the illicit trade. The Customs Administration, though foreign trade is at a low ebb, plays an important part in the price - stabilization program; and, through its director, Mr. Gresham, is expected to assist materially in the promo tion of Iran’s trade after the war. The Administration of Ceded Properties, Domains and Exploitation, directed by Mr. Emami, is engaged in settling the cases of the ceded pro perties, a work which, I am assured, will be completed, so far as the Ad ministration is concerned, in a few months. In addition, more energetic action is being taken with regard to the public domains, certain construc tion work has been accomplished and improvements in cultivation intro duced, and new regulations have been issued governing the sale of do mains. In addition to the internal reorganization, already mentioned, in the Administration of Accounts and Audits, this administration, under Mr. Shambarger, has brought about commendable economies in its own staff, has effectively handled the preparation of the Government budget, has tak en steps to improve and expedite the accounting work of the Govern ment, and has made progress in the handling of claims against the Govern ment. Besides the performance of its routine functions, which are of the greatest importance, the Treasury - General under Mr. Ardalan has, in cooperation with Mr. Shambarger and Dr. Groseclose, reorganized andsimplified the Government s accounts at the Banque Mellie. The Treasury- General has made arrangements to obtain more electric power at the Mint to provide for the minting of small coins. In general, the Treasury - Genqflfc ral has cooperated in working out emergency financial questions. Dr. Atkins’ work during the Month of Ordibehesht has been research and advisory in character, relating in the main to agricultural prices, prices of non-food products, rents, rationing, and industrial conditions. He has attended numerous committee meetings and conferences. The rent regulation pre viously mentioned was based on Dr. Atkins studies. While the Banque Mellie Iranis not, of course, a branch of the Min istry of f inance, in the same sense as the Administrations just mentioned mentioned, its relationship with this Ministry is close; and its Gover nor, Mr. Ebtehaj, has been uniformly cooperative and helpful in the work ing out of financial programs and in the effort to find solutions for the Government’s financial problems. I hope for the same relations with the Mortgage Bank, the Iran Insurance Company, and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and trust that these institutions may become more useful parts of the financial structure of Iran. The most important personnel changes to be reported are the above- mentioned appointment of Mr. Robinson, the appointment of Mr. Nariman as Director- General of the Internal Revenue Administration to succeed Mr. Robinson, the appointment of Mr. Davoud Pirnia as Director of the Depart ment of Correspondence and Archives, and the assignment of Mr. Majid Zadeh as provincial Director of Finance in Azerbaidjan. In closing this report, I wish to convey to Your Excellency the assur ances of my most distinguished consideration. A. €. MillspuughAppendix A. v IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT OF IRAN.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 129 of the 26th April, 1945 T I have ' ' the honour to transmit the following figures obtained from Mr. Johnson, the ^- C American Treasurer-General to the Persian Government, relating to the Persian budget for the year 1323 (21st March, 1944—20th March, 1945). The budget is divided into two parts : the Ordinary budget, which covers ordinary revenue and expenditure; and the Commercial budget, which relates to the operations oi yt *^ Government commercial enterprises, factories, &amp;c. . /W* ^ 2 . The results for the Ordinary budget were as follows :— Rial a. Ordinary Revenue 3.924,678,000 Ordinary Expenditure 3,844,532,000 Surplus 80,146,000 The results of the Commercial budget were as follows: — Rials- Commercial Revenue ... ... 3,459,572,000 Commercial Expenditure ... ... 4,001,853,000 3- fa 4? 0.0. %. Deficit 542,281,000 The total deficit on the two budgets was therefore Rials 462,135,000. 3. For the sake of comparison I append the corresponding figures for the previous year 1322 (21st March, 1943-20th March, 1944): — Million Rials. Ordinary Revenue Ordinary Expenditure Surplus Commercial Revenue Commercial Expenditure Deficit Total deficit 4,386 3,697 689 2,132 3,873 1,741 1,052 4. The results in 1323 therefore show some improvement over those for the previous year, for which a great deal of credit must go to Dr. Millspaugh and to the efforts of his mission to restore order to Persia's finances. The deficit in 1323 was due to the uneconomical operation of the Government commercial enterprises and monopolies and there is little doubt that if this millstone did not hang around the neck of the Persian Government the public finances of this country would be in a much healthier condition. Stocks of goods in the possession of the Government are thought, however, to amount in value to at least as much as the deficit on the 1323 budget, though with the fall in prices to be expected now that the war in Europe is over the value of these goods will in the future become progressively less. 5. The Government’s budgetary difficulties, reflected in the delay in the payment of the salaries of civil servants and in the inability of the Government to settle its current debts to the Allies (particularly to the British) and its other claims, are due mainly to the shortage of liquid cash. Government expenditure is being met on a hand-to-mouth basis, and there is no reserve available from [66—60] , ’ BECo. POL. DEPT- 13 JUL19* Cwhich to meet any unexpected outgoings in addition to the outstanding liabilities referred to above, if the need should arise suddenly. For example, it is hard to see where the Persian Government would find the money with which to bu\ expensive surplus military installations—such sales would almost certainly have to be on a credit basis if the Persian Government is to be the buyer. 6 . There would seem to be only one obvious solution to these difficulties and that is the more efficient and determined collection of taxes. There is plenty of money in the possession of private persons and with normally efficient taxation the Government should be able to meet its current obligations easily. The foreign exchange position is strong, so there is no justification for a foreign loan. For the last two years the Persian Government has come to rely increasingly on the A.I.O.C. royalties to help it out of difficult situations, and there are indications that this year also the Persian Government will expect to keep itself going by receiving royalty payments before the due dates, if possible, free of interest. This, of course, is no satisfactory substitute for obtaining sufficient revenue from taxation as the royalty payments are made in sterling and the subsequent conversion into rials increases the quantity of notes in circulation and merely adds to the already unsatisfactory position in that respect. 7. The prospects for the future are not particularly bright. It is reported in the press that owing to the clamour against the present rates of income tax, the Government has promised to introduce a new income tax Bill. No mention has yet been made of the nature of this Bill but there seems to be little doubt that the rates will be lower and the conditions easier. Nor has there yet been any proposal to counter-balance this probable loss of revenue by the imposition of extra taxes in other directions, though it seems possible that the Government will look rather to import and monopoly dues to provide revenue than to any form of direct taxation. 8.

(b) Lnder the Anglo-Persian financial agreement the value of the rial is fixed at 128 to to the pound sterling. This deficit is thus equivalent to rather over £8 million. [65—49] HECfl. POL DEPT. -» JULIW INDIA OrTIcI2 4 The ordinary budget covers normal administration. The commercial budget covers in the main two entirely different types of activity, viz. (a) administration of the Government factories and (b) the purchase, transport, distribution and sale of food-stuffs and certain other goods. Although the provisional position for 1944-45 is better than that for the preceding year, it will be seen that the small surplus on the ordinary budget is not sufficient to ^ compensate for the deficit on the commercial budget. This deficit is caused - chiefly by (a) food subsidies and ( 6 ) wasteful and corrupt management of thg State factories. 5. The ordinary budget for the year 1945-46 balances at 4,412 million rials, but only by the optimistic transfer of a surplus of 500 million rials from the commercial budget, which has not yet been prepared.

The internal debt of the Government (to the National Bank) is 4,800 million rials. There is only one item in external debt, viz., a loan from Great Britain, of which about &lt;£750,000 is outstanding. II. 9. Since the autumn of 1941 the position of the Persian Government has been rendered more difficult by Allied military expenditure in the country. Nevertheless, before the Allied occupation Persia had already become accustomed to the inflationary process, and given a reasonably able Government much could be done by the Persian authorities to avoid heavy budgetary deficits and the increase in inflation. It was not until the beginning of 1943 that, after continued Allied pressure for administrative assistance from abroad, Dr. Millspaugh, an American, was appointed as Administrator-General of Finance with extensive executive powers covering both the ordinary budget and the Government’s commercial activities. The next two years are a record of expectation on the part of the Persian Government and people that Dr. Millspaugh would work miracles in spite of the continued and calculated obstruction to him in his task by the Government and business community generally. He finally resigned in disgust and left the country last February. 10. Those of Dr. Millspaugh’s American staff who have remained are not of high efficiency; and of some of them it must be said, with regret, that they appear likely to acquiesce in measures of which they do not approve in order to retain thei i ,# own positions. In spite of the slight improvement shown in the figures for 1944-45, compared with 1943-44, the country’s finances are in a ( 2 ) Estimated.3 serious condition. The largely increased rates of income tax imposed by Dr. Millspaugh have failed in their object. This is partly because he himself underestimated the difficulty of accustoming the community to the payment of high direct taxation at short notice. In the event, the reluctance of the tax payer to contribute and the extreme willingness of the underpaid and corrupt officials to accept bribes instead of taxes have resulted in the receipts for 1944-45 being considerably less than under the lower rates current in the vprevious year. It is probable that the rates will be reduced from the beginning of 1945-46. It is uncertain whether collections will improve, but it is clear enough that arrears will be forgotten. Some effort is being made to bridge the gap by the retrograde measure of increasing indirect taxation on essential goods such as tea, sugar, petroleum, &amp;c. 11 . The Government has reached its statutory limit of borrowing from the National Bank and is living from hand to mouth. Thus, the salaries of Government servants (amounting to *200 million rials monthly) are normally a month in arrears. Some weeks ago the Government found it necessary to request payment of the periodical instalment of royalties from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company ten days before it was due because it could not carry on for even this short period. It is also endeavouring to obtain parliamentary sanction to borrow another 200 million rials on short term from the National Bank. The organisation of the commercial activities of the Government is virtually in chaos now that Dr. Millspaugh has retired. Post-war plans are of the vaguest. 12 . It is probable, therefore, that, although owing to the favourable war news, there are some small signs of a downward turn in the circulation and price figures, a financial crisis is to be expected in Persia within, say, the next six or twelve months. This will be accentuated by the deflation following the end of the war with Germany, involving among other things even greater difficulty in collecting taxation ; by the expectation of increased imports from abroad, which will result in an over-sudden fall in prices within the country; and by the handicap to exports of the still high internal level of production costs. Unemployment will be increased by the withdrawal, in due time, of the Allied military forces ; and there may well be civil disturbances, possibly on a serious scale. III.* 13. If Persia were competently governed she could be financially self- supporting, and could provide a considerably higher standard of living for the undernourished and ragged millions of her population. Under the ordinary budget at the present time some 25 per cent, of expenditure (both in 1944-45 and 1945-46) is allocated to the army, the almost useless plaything of Reza Shah Pahlavi and the present monarch, instead of to irrigation and agricultural development. Another 15 per cent, is spent on the gendarmarie and police. About 20 per cent, goes on the management of the monopolies and the, at present, abortive administration for the collection of taxes. Education and public health account for no more than 6 per cent, and 4 per cent, of total expenditure. On the side of receipts, 16 per cent, is estimated ibut it is an over-estimate) to come from direct taxation, while indirect taxation produces 50 per cent. The propertied classes are without conscience in their evasion of taxation; and the officials are so rooted in corruption that it would persist to a large extent even if they were adequately paid. Successive Cabinets do not expect to remain long in office and have no incentive towards reform ; in the last year there have been four Ministers of Finance. 14. If a new dictator, endowed with a keener financial sense than Reza Shah, should come into power, and exercise the ruthlessness that is required— selling or giving away the State factories, cutting down the Government officials by 50 or 60 per cent., reducing corruption and collecting taxes from the rich as well as the poor—the situation might perhaps be retrieved. There are, however, strong political obstacles to the rise of a dictator so long as foreign troops are . in the country, and the remedy must be sought for elsewhere. The only alter- | native, in my view, is the engagement of another and a better Dr. Millspaugh, j presumably from the United States, to take charge of Persian financial adminis tration. This is a particularly unfavourable moment for such a suggestion, since the one good deed with which the late Cabinet is credited by the majority of the vocal part of the Persian population, is the liquidation of Dr. Millspaugh. Unless, however, something drastic is done, Persia will fall into a state of chaos and thereby play into the hands of her northern neighbour. E. N. R TRENTHAM.

Financial Situation. 3 . r ,^HIS report follows in series my general reports of the 3rd July and the cr, 0ctober ’ 1944 (enclosed with despatches No. 283 E, of t he 9th July, and yu-qiP^No^l io of the_26th Octobe r, 1944b Public Finance. The figures of revenue and expenditure for the first nine months of ioooA^x 1 year 1944 - 45 . ( be g inn ing on the 21st March, 1944—the Persian year 1626 A.H ) are now available. They compare as follows with those for the corresponding period in the previous year :— Ordinary Budget — Revenue Expenditure (Million rials.) 1923-U. 1944—25. 3,287 2,972 2,841 2,716 Surplus 446 256 Commercial Budget — Revenue Expenditure 1,537 2,820 2,640 3,115 Deficit 1,283 475 Net Deficit 837 219 3. The estimates for the whole year 1944-45 are as follows Ordinary Budget— Million rials. 3,958 4,569 Revenue Expenditure2 4. As to the Ordinary Budget, the situation is less favourable than appears from the figures in the second paragraph. For one thing, the expenditure does not include the salaries of Government servants for the ninth month (some 200 million rials). The budget, although submitted to the Parliament (Majlis) last June, has not yet been approved, and expenditure is being authorised in the meantime by periodical Votes on Account, the last (like some of the others) haviny*** been passed too late for the punctual payment of salaries. More important, however, is the fact that receipts from income tax, which were estimated at v 885 million rials for the year, are likely to fall far short of this figure. Although the rates are considerably higher than in 1943-44, receipts in Tehran have been no more than 284 million rials in the first nine months of the year, compared with 273 million in the same period of the preceding year, and this figure has only been reached because the income tax paid by the National Bank has amounted to 140 million as against 40 million last year. Similarly, receipts (including income tax) from the provinces over the period have so far been 430 million as against 500 million in the first nine months of 1943-44. 5. The recent history of income tax in Persia has been unfortunate. There , was long and widespread opposition to any increase in the previous inadequate rates, and the new rates were only voted, as from the 21st March, 1944, after Dr. Millspaugh, the American Administrator-General of the Finances, had threatened resignation. Their operation was further delayed by lengthy I deliberations of the Parliament over the tax regulations. When these were finally I passed, there ensued a widespread movement of something approaching passive resistance on the part of the taxpayer; refusal to fill in returns, obstruction, threats of strikes fomented by the industrialists and bribery on a scale remarkable i even for Persia have all contributed to the present position. Dr. Millspaugh attributes the smallness of the collections to the elaborate provisions for appeal against assessment which were attached to his draft Bill by the Parliament; but there is no doubt that he underrated the difficulty of making a country such as Persia submit to heavy direct taxation at short notice, and as matters stand at the moment his scheme must be accounted a failure. If an adequate staff were available, the taxation, or a great deal more than at present, could in fact be collected, as has happened in one province in which the American finance director is of outstanding ability. It may be possible to balance the Ordinary Budget by cutting expenditure. But, except for the a,rmy (which accounts for 25 per cent, of total expenditure, with a return of nil), the public services of the country, j education and public health in particular, are already starved. As to the future, taxation will be even more difficult to collect when deflation sets in. 6. The shortage of income tax receipts has also, as stated in an earlier report, affected seriously the finances of the municipalities, since they were to be financed by a 10 per cent, surtax on income tax payments, in place of other taxation which has been abolished. They are for the present subsisting on loans from the National Bank guaranteed by the Central Government, which will have to honour its guarantees sooner or later. At the present time the Government has reached its statutory limit for borrowing from the National Bank. 7. The activities covered by the Commercial Budget fall into two chief parts: (a) purchase and sale to the public of food-stuffs and piece-goods; (b) administration of the Government factories and properties. Under the latter heading, outgoings during the first nine months of the year have been 820 million rials as against receipts of 376 million; Dr. Millspaugh’s plans for closing or , turning over most of the factories to private ownership have not yet materialised. Under the former, large stocks are being held by the Government, particularly of cereals and grain; the budgetary position at the end of the year will depend partly on the extent to which they have been disposed of, and partly on the cost of food subsidies. The figures on each side of the account are likely to be considerably short of the estimates. ! r £&gt; enera l.fi nanc i a l situation is aggravated by the Russian occupation of the northein provinces of Persia, which has impeded the collection of taxation in that area, wheie in normal times two-thirds of the country^ revenue is i collected. Further, until about a year ago the Russians refused to pnv customs duties on their imports; and, although they now pay, they estimate the amount payable themselves ana do not allow the Persian officials to examine the goods j Again, they are dilatory in their payment to the Persian Government for purchases made (although there is some sign of improvement in this respect) while they demand immediate cash'for their sales. They are also in arrear in their payments for munitions from the Persian factories; and they obtain local ; currency which they require largely by selling goods imported from Russia (and3 ' v 1 L t L ) possibly Japan) on the open market at prices much higher than the Government- controlled price. 9. As a result of the change of Government, M. Ammanullah Ardalan succeeded M. Zarrinkafsh as Minister of Finance towards the end of November. He is a former official of the Ministry of Finance, and has already been Minister. He is about as good a man to fill the position as anyone whom Persia can provide. Banking, Currency and Price Indices. 10 . The following table brings up to date the figures given in previous reports of notes in circulation and bank deposits :— {Million rials) June 1941 June 1942 June 1943 June 1944 July 1944 August 1944 September 1944...

I he following index (prepared by the National Bank) shows wholesale prices and the cost of living:— % (1939 = 100) June 1941 June 1942 June 1943 June 1944 July 1944 August 1944 September 1944...

It appears from these figures that {a) the inflationary process is still continuing after a break following on the invasion of western Europe, and ( 6 ) prices which fell partly from the same reason and partly because of improved distribution have now begun to rise again. There is probably, however, some seasonal element in this increase. It is satisfactory to note that the marked difference between the wholesale and cost-of-living indices, the reasons for which were given in a previous report, is now tending to disappear, and the two sets of figures are coming more closely together. The general trend of prices should now be on the decrease, apart from seasonal factors and such fluctuations as may occur in the course of war operations. Generally, however, it is of advantage to Persia that the decline in prices should be cushioned and gradual. The country is far from ready to meet the shock of post-war economics. 13. Sales of gold in Persia for the account of His Majesty’s Government, which began in the summer of 1943, were suspended on the 15th January, 1945’ During this period they amounted to a total of £6-95 million. These sales have had no appreciable effect in checking inflation, the purpose for which they were originally designed, but have been useful in the past in enabling His Majesty’s Government to obtain local currency at a cheaper rate than that fixed under the Anglo-Persian financial agreement of May 1942. Ultimately, however, the market for gold in Persia reached saturation point, and it appeared about two months ago that (on the best estimates available) about 90 per cent, of the gold sold was being smuggled into Iraq for Iraq itself, Egypt, Syria and beyond. Since the volume of goods obtainable in Iraq in exchange for this gold is very small and the supply of Persian currency there has greatly decreased, the result has recently been that Iraq dinar notes have been finding their way into Persia, with the result that the Government’s sterling balances have correspondingly increased. In view of the provision in the Anglo-Persian financial agreement that 60 per cent, of the increase in sterling balances from quarter to quarter is to be converted4 by His Majesty’s Government into gold, its gold sales in Persia have, for the present at least, been discontinued. Prospective Position. • 14. A few months after Dr. Millspaugh came to Persia as Administrator- General of the Finances in February 1943, he took over at the request of the Persian Government certain economic powers in addition. These were mainly (a) the purchase, transport, distribution and rationing of food-stuffs and certain other goods, (b) price control, and (c) administration of the Government factories. When the Government proposed, in the summer of 1944, to take these powers away from him on the ground that he had not exercised them with sufficient competence, he resigned; the Government then withdrew from their position and Dr. Millspaugh withdrew his resignation. Not long afterwards he issued a letter of dismissal to his sworn enemy in Persia, M. Ibtihaj, governor of the National Bank, from his post; but the Government considered that he had exceeded his powers and M. Ihtihaj continued in office. Largely as a result of this exceedingly ill-judged (even if possibly legal) action on Dr. Millspaugh’s part, the agitation against him was renewed; and theParliament, after atypical two or three weeks’ debate punctuated by public holidays, lack of a quorum and interpellations on other subjects, passed early in January an Act depriving him of his economic powers as distinguished from his functions in the Ministry of Finance. They did so, however, without having reached, or attempted, any conclusion as to how these functions should be discharged; but they have now appointed a committee (consisting of Persians only) to deliberate on the subject. Some are in favour of establishing a new Ministry of Economic Affairs for the purpose; but it is to be hoped that this will not be done since it would be many months before the Ministry would function with anything approaching efficiency. A better solution would be to attach these functions to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and to appoint a more energetic Minister than the present aged M. Hedayat. This new organisation, if it is to be at all effective, will need to be bolstered by those of Dr. Millspaugh’s American staff who have been concerned with this work in the past, using executive rather than merely advisory authority; but the Government’s decision is to be deplored. 15. At this juncture Dr. Millspaugh has stated that unless the Government uphold his action in dismissing M. Ibtihaj, he will resign; and a number of his staff have announced a similar intention. These resignations have been deferred for the present until the issue between the two protagonists has been discussed and determined by the Parliament; but it is unlikely that they will decide against a Persian in favour of a foreigner. Nevertheless,^ Persia is a country devoted, perhaps excessively, to compromise; Dr. Millspaugh does not wish, if he can avoid it. to leave Persia as the failure which he would be accounted to be if he went at the present time, and he has not yet made up his mind whether to leave or to stay. In view of his defects in temperament it is not desirable that he should remain here much longer; but his presence in the country at a time when the financial situation is serious and plans for the post-war period are inchoate would present certain advantages, especially since if he leaves now the more competent of his American staff may go with him. If he remains for a few months (as at any rate M. Ardalan, the Minister of Finance, hopes he will do), he will be able to see the end of the current financial year, to present the budget for 1945-46; to do something through the American staff to set the new economic organisation on its feet; and to prepare the way for the successor from abroad who is required if the financial affairs of this unhappy, incompetent and corrupt country are to be administered with any degree of success.

This figure jrovides only 16 per cent of the estimate of total receijits. Indirect taxation (including tlie monoxiolies on opium, tobacco, sugar and tea) recounts for 50 per cent end the .hngl o-hei* si an royalties recount for 12 &gt;er cent. The estiiikj.ted revenue from Posts and Tele-y&amp;pha of 120 million rials will not cover the expenditure on the service, which is estimated at 145 million. The budget Iso includes receipts of 125 million from the public domains and ceded properties which previously farmed part of the Commercial budget; expenditure under this liead is estiiaA.tod at 76 million for the year. 4. The expenditure aide of the bulget is divided up nnrth in tlie s^no proportions as in 1944-45. Thus expenditure on the Amy is estimated at 1100 million rials or no less than 25 per cent of the total.

Administration of the tobacco and opium monopolies is estimated to cost 550 idillion rials, repcesentin- 11 per cent of the total, while the Ministry of finance require rather over 300 million, mainly for tlie collection of taxation.

Revised figures have been issued by the Government for the out-turn of the financial year 1943-44 {i.e., the Persian year 1322, beginning on the 21st March, 1943); and the deficit for the year is now given as 1.052 million rials instead of 1,372 million as stated in my last report.

Even though seven months of the current financial year have passed, the budget is still under consideration of the Budgetary Commission of the Parlia ment, and has not yet been before Parliament itself; although the commission has endeavoured to accelerate its deliberations by the threat of stopping the salaries of the Ministers and senior officials of those departments which are dilatorv in supplying the budgetary details which it requires.

Surplus 398 1,430 1,537 Deficit 146 Commercial Revenue Commercial Expenditure 2,516 2,318 Deficit 107 Surplus 198 The higher figures under the commercial budget compared with last year are due to increased purchases and sales of food-stuffs and other goods; not to any increased activity in the Government-owned factories. ^ , , 6 It is not yet possible, however, to make any reliable forecast oi the out turn for the year! The budget as prepared (see paragraph 5 of my report ot the 3rd July) showed a small deficit on the Ordinary and a small surplus on the Commercial Accounts (611 and 612 million respectively), i.e., the budget was, in effect, in balance. Dr. Millspaugh at the moment expects no deficit, or only a small one; but receipts from direct taxation will almost certainly be below the estimate. At the present time the Government are embarrassed financially owing to these receipts for the earlier part of the year not having come up to expectation, and have only been able to pay their way by obtaining an advance on royalties from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; but income tax receipts should increase materially in the coming months, there remain, however, the difficulties in collecting full revenue from that part of Persia, and by far the richest part, occupied by the U.S.S.R. 7. The municipalities are similarly embarrassed, since the 3 per cent, tax on goods entering their areas was abolished at the end of last year and the 10 per cent, surtax on income tax payments which was to replace it has not yet come in. They are being assisted by short-term loans from the Central Government to an amount of 36 million rials, the loan in the case of Tehran being 9 million. Much effective work is being done by the American financial directors in the provincial districts. In one instance taxation receipts have gone up by nearly two and a half times as a result of more efficiency and less corruption in collection. The municipal authorities need considerable guidance in financial affairs; they are liable to produce a draft budget in which often as much as 80 per cent., and sometimes the full 100 per cent., of revenue is taken up by the salaries of officials and other staff. 8 . Some six weeks ago, among other Cabinet changes, M. Ferochar was succeeded as Minister of Finance by M. Zarrinkafsh. Although M. Zarrinkafsh could not be called a strong man, he is a great improvement on his predecessor. He has served in London and Washington as well as on the Continent, and has a wider knowledge of the world; and, more important, the relations between him and Dr. Millspaugh are excellent. He deplores the high percentage of expenditure (25 per cent.) on the army, that maladministered and useless body, when, as a result, services such as agriculture, public health and education are starved—although this year a beginning is, it is hoped, to be made with a system of compulsory education. How far, however, he or Dr. Millspaugh can succeed in redressing the present lack of proportion in the expenditure on the different Government services is another matter.3 Banking, Currency, Price Indices. .9. The following figures show the amount of notes in circulation and of bank deposits over the last three years and in recent months : 10 . Notes. Deposits, {million rials.)

The recent fall in prices has been due in part to improvements in distribution, but mainly to the favourable course of tlm war, and apart from possible seasonal causes it may be expected to continue. Until about a month ago the fall in wholesale prices was not reflected in the retail market, since the retailer, although he could now buy more cheaply, was unwilling to deplete the huge gains which he had made in the past by foregoing previous rates of profit on stocks in hand. There are now signs that he is bowing to the inevitable, with the exception for the moment of the important semi-industrial district of Isfahan. A certain number of bankruptcies are to be expected, but according to the most recent reports of bankers through the country no immediate economic dislocation ' is likely; although a sudden ending of the European war at the present juncture and an attendant steep decline in the price level might well result in a crisis of considerable severity. 12 . As stated in the last report, the proceeds of the sale of gold for the account of His Majesty’s Government amounted to £3-9 million up to the end of June 1944. For the period from the 1st July to the 15th October they were £1-6 million. During this period fluctuations in sales have been considerable, owing partly to the war news and partly to an interruption in the smuggling traffic into Iraq by the temporary arrest of some prospective smugglers. It is estimated that at the present time gold to the value of some £150,000 a week is leaving Persia for Iraq and Saudi Arabia. These sales of gold have had no important effect in combating inflation in Persia, but are useful in providing rials at a cheaper rate than that of 128 to the £1 fixed under the financial agreement with the Persian Government. The Future. 13. When, by agreement with the Persian Government, Dr. Millspaugh withdrew his resignation last July he informed the Government that he expected within a few months to be able to show more palpable results than had been possible so far. A week or two ago he addressed a letter to the Prime Minister, which was also published in the press, to the effect that (1) Every possible action had been taken to obtain adequate imports. (2) Prices are falling. (3) Distribution and transport have steadily improved. (4) Persia has the largest stocks of grain in its history. (5) Revenue has greatly increased. (6) Sound plans for the post-war period are in hand.14. In the meantime, fair consideration of this letter has been obscured by one of Dr. Millspaugh’s characteristic errors of judgment. In my last report (paragraph 17) I referred to the unveiled hostility between M. Ibtihaj; the governor of the National Bank, and himself. Some weeks ago Dr. Millspaugh requested that his staff be permitted to examine certain of the bank s accounts. M. Ibtihaj refused, whereupon Dr. Millspaugh wrote to him dismissing him from his position. The Council of Ministers decided by a majority vq*^ (M. Zarrinkafsh voting with the minority) that Dr. Millspaugh had exceeds his powers and that his dismissal of M. Ibtihaj was invalid. Whether or not Dr. Millspaugh was within his powers is doubtful; but there is no doubt that his action was high-handed, most inexpedient politically, and is likely to have a lasting effect on his credit in the country. It is such ill-judged actions on his part that make it sometimes difficult for the American Embassy and this embassy to give him full support. On the other side of the scales, his position has to some extent been improved by a recent letter from President Roosevelt to the Shah in which, to all accounts, the President commended the work which the American Mission is doing. 15. The statement of the present economic position given in Dr. Millspaugh’s letter to the Prime Minister is accurate enough—except that revenue has not greatly increased. ”( l ) But the improvement in the situation is in fact due to •the development of the war in Europe to a greater extent than to the efforts of The mission. There are still many difficulties ahead; revenue from income tax will fall greatly short of the estimates; all idea of raising an internal loan has had to be abandoned, largely owing to the high rates of interest current in the country generally ;( 2 ) plans to cushion an eventual sharp fall in prices and to relieve post-war unemployment are not yet formulated. 16. Two other matters, mainly involving finance, are understood to be in hand. One is a detailed statement of claims on the part of the Persian Govern ment for what the Shah in a recent speech called quite seriously the immense sacrifices endured by Persia during the war and her incalculable assistance to the Allied cause. The other is a document to be laid in due course before the Peace Conference setting out Persia’s claims for compensation in general. Both no doubt will be drafted with a practised eye on the procedure of bazaar negotiation. 17. It may well be that Dr. Millspaugh will have left Persia before these j documents see the light. He is at the moment anxious to leave in February 1945, j when he will have completed two years as Administrator-General of the Finances, jand to train his successor during the interval. This successor may be one of the additional staff whom he hopes shortly to import from the United States; or it may be Dr. Black, who is at present his deputy in charge of distribution, but, in the view of some people at least, has hardly proved himself adequate to fill the higher position. Plainly it will be necessary when the times comes not merely to find the right man, but to ensure that his powers are sufficient. Persia at the present time is entirely unfitted to cope unaided with its post-war problems; and His Majesty’s Government is not without its share of responsibility in having, although of necessity, made more difficult the task of a Government which, it was known, could not govern competently even in normal times.

The deficit is the result of (a) the necessity for subsidising food-stuffs and (b) the incompetent and, in a number of cases, dishonest management of the Government industrial under takings. The budgetary deficit for this year, as for previous years, was met by borrowing from the National Bank. 5. The budget for the year 1044-45 was recently presented to the Parlia ment. The estimates are— {Million rials.) Ordinary budget— Revenue ... 3,958 Expenditure ... 4.569 Deficit 611( 2 ) 6. The ordinary budget provides for receipts from income tax under con siderably higher scales than formerly. They were adopted reluctantly by the Government last autumn in face of Dr. Millspaugh’s threatened resignation. Nevertheless, direct taxation bears a proportion of no more than 20 per cent, to total revenue. The opium, tobacco, sugar and tea monopolies provide 40 per cent., customs and other indirect taxation 14 per cent., and Anglo-Persian oil royalties 13 per cent. On the expenditure side, no less than 25 per cent, is taken up by the Persian army and 12 per cent, by the gendarmerie and police; even so, heavy cuts were made in the draft estimates for these services. The monopolies account for another 15 per cent, of expenditure, and agriculture and industry for 12 per cent. Education and public health bring up the rear with 6 per cent, and 4 per cent, respectively. 7. Under the commercial budget for 1944-45 the financial mission has provided for {a) the purchase and distribution by the Government of food-stuffs and other goods on a large scale with a view to bringing down prices, and (b) the transfer to private enterprise of part of the Government industrial undertakings, and either discontinuance or the competent financial and general management of the remainder. These undertakings are mainly an inheritance from the grandiose, but somewhat unbalanced, schemes of Shah Reza. They have been inefficiently managed and are in some cases honeycombed with graft. The whole system of Government industrial undertakings admittedly needs fundamental reorganisation. 8. At the end of the year 1943-44 the Government debt to the National Bank was 3,882 million rials and its total internal debt 4,440 million rials. Its external debt consisted of one item only, the Sterling Loan of May 1911. The original amount of this loan was £1,250.000, the rate of interest being 5 per cent. The balance outstanding at the end of 1943-44 was £876,816. In his speech to Parliament on the budget for 1944-45 the Minister of Finance (M. Foroohar) stated that he had no intention of borrowing either from abroad j or internally. The observation as regards internal borrowing shows how little he understands his business.

The National Bank is considering a more uniform method of compilation, but there is not much doubt that the figures given substantially represent the increase in the level of prices. 11. Responsibility for the serious situation disclosed by these figures is to be divided between— (i) Allied military expenditure since the occupation of August 1941( 3 ); (ii) Budgetary deficits and the failure of the Government to take adequate steps for the control of inflation; and also (iii) The closing of trade channels owing to the war, the partial failure of the harvest in 1941-42 and the disorganisation of internal transport. I It is clear, however, that the major cause of the existing position has been the military expenditure of the Allies.( 4 ) 12. It was decided a year ago to sell gold in Persia for the account of His Majesty's Government, with the double object of (i) absorbing part of the surplus of the country's purchasing power, and (ii) providing some of the currency required for military expenditure without a corresponding expansion of the note issue. The results of sales in Persia, however, have been disappointing compared with those in other Middle Eastern countries in which the same policy was later followed. They amounted to £3-9 million up to the end of June 1944, and have been very greatly less than Allied or British military expenditure, and than the increase in the note issue. The sales have had no tangible effect in lowering the price of commodities (although real estate values have fallen because investors have put their money into gold instead); nevertheless, it can justly be said that if gold had not been sold the situation would have been still more difficult than it is. There are signs, however, in the last few weeks that sales in Persia, may go up considerably owing to the policy of His Majesty’s Government, adopted recently, of curtailing them in neighbouring countries. The additional sales are no doubt increasing the volume of smuggling from South-West Persia to Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the only or main effective limit to this traffic being the amount of suitable goods which can be obtained in exchange. 13. It may be added here that up to September 1943 the rial proceeds of gold sales for the account of His Majesty’s Government were used by the British military authorities towards meeting their local expenditure. This arrangement provided a considerable saving compared with the purchase of rials at 128 to the pound sterling, the rate fixed under the Anglo-Persian Financial Agreement of May 1942; a rate which is now something like one-sixth of the internal purcbas,hmg power of the rial. For the last nine months the proceeds of gold sales have been transferred to the United States authorities. Sales have not been sufficient to meet the United States requirements for rials and there has therefore been no surplus (except in one comparatively small instance) for British military expenditure. ( 3 ) An additional cause was expenditure, financed by His Majesty’s Government, on the considerable number of Polish refugees who came into Persia from Russia in 1942. This expenditure, however, has recently decreased considerably. ( 4 ) It is hardly possible to show this in figures. The theoretical calculation would be—Allied expenditure less import surplus plus budget deficits ;^but exact data are hard to obtain. Very roughly Allied expenditure is probably 66 per cent, responsible. [55—65] b 24 The Millsvaugh Mission. . 14 It will be apparent that when Dr. Millspaugh reached Persia with his mission in the spring of 1943, the situation was gradually but sure y. of control. In such a situation it was, of course, impossible to f re f‘ (as the Persians expected) the progress of the disease, apart fiom the fac in this case wholesale administrative reorganisation was required as well as tPe specific measures necessary to check the inflationary pr°(*ss. In the last fa months Dr. Millspaugh has faced squarely the twin problems nurchasine power, whether by taxation or borrowing; and of pine control, wiiSe distribution and the prevention of speculation. His powers were increased in the autumn of 1943 by the addition of economic «mtic the two are, of course, inseparable and he was rightly unwilling to leave t e former in Persian hands while only the latter was m his own. 15 His difficult task has been made more difficult for two reasons. The hist concerns his own personality and his staff. Dr. Millspaugh is in his sixties, and not in o-ood health. Perhaps because of this, although to an outsider he shows the greftest charm of manner, it is credibly said that this is by no means a ways the case to his own staff; and he certainly is sometimes far from diplomatic in his dealings with the Persian Government and its Ministers, although it is easy to excuse impatience or irritation in anyone who is in constant coutactatclose quarters with the Persian official character. He has not been able to obtain as large a staff from the United States as he requires, and some of them, engaged without being known to him before, have turned out to be unsatisfactory. Others found the country not what they had imagined it to be and left aiteI a shot time In addition. Dr. Millspaugh is by training a theorist rather than an administrator, and one of the not unjustified complaints against him is that he centralises the work of the mission unduly in his own hands. 16 The second difficulty is even more important, viz the enemies whom he has made because he is doing his work conscientiously and well. T he hhah is against him; for no one has ever before dared to interfere with the army estimates, and Dr. Millspaugh will not give back the huge sums misappropriated bv Shah Reza, which the present Shah handed over to the Government and would now like returned to him in order that he may continue his present scale oi living, subsidise worthless politicians and newspapers and bolster his popularity b\ well-advertised charitable endowments. The Russians are against Dr. Millspaugh because they dislike any influence on the affairs of Persia, even though invited, except their own whether invited or not. Many of the well-to-do 1 ersians, m politics or not, are against him because of his intention that they should pay more jin taxation; only half realising that a ruined country will bring them down with jit The press, subsidised and egged on by these various elements, is nearly uniformly unfavourable to him. Worse possibly than this unconcealed opposition is the pusillanimity of the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, whose intentionally half-hearted efforts in defending him against public criticism in Parliament'where he cannot defend himself have passed into a determination to subiect him to Persian control. 17 One particular and bitter opponent of Dr. Millspaugh must be mentioned. He is M. Ibtihaj, the succesful Governor of the National Bank. M. Ibtihai’s powers of intrigue are levelled equally against the Imperial Bank of Persia, where he was once employed in a subordinate post, and Dr. Millspaugh Bv open opposition, by intensive and unscrupulous (though not a ^ a ys very subtle) propaganda, M. Ibtihaj is bending all his efforts to undermine Dr Millspaugh s influence and force his retirement. He stated publicly that within five days after his arrival in the United States, where he is now leading ^the Government delegation to the Monetary Conference, ( 5 ) he would f£ have Dr .Millspaugh out. While M Ibtihaj is handicapped by the inability to control his temper, he is, on the other hand, a person of mental vigour, powerful concentration and high ambition He says that he was recently offered and refused the post of Minister of Finance, which is very possibly true. In any case, if he wishes, his power to influence Persian affairs in the future is likely to be substantial. The Civil Service. 18 Even in normal times the pay of the ordinary official was low; and the Persian’s natural acquisitiveness has been intensified in the case of the civil servants bv the fact that owing to the rise in prices it is long since many ot them have received a living wage. In addition, the practice of making numerous (») It may be remarked that the Prime Miaiater nave this mission to M. Ibtihaj without consulting Dr.' Millspaugh.5 «' (jovernment appointments for political services, given or expectec , or from nepotism, has resulted in a service which is, in general, well below even (he mod average standard of Persian competence. The outcome is a comh Inat.inpf 1 inefficiency and corruption which, although it always existed, has growrTsfeacl over the last few years. The diversion of taxation receipts to the officials’ 0 1 pockets, thefts and embezzlement of public money and stores by public servants, collusion between dishonest officials and tax-payers or contractors, have had their effect both on revenue and on such morale as the service possesses. 19. Soon after the American Mission’s arrival, expenditure at the rate of 500 million rials a year was added to the budget for increased pay to civil servants, but this did not fully compensate them for the higher cost of living, and additional amounts (not yet specified) are being provided in the current year. Further, a Civil Service Bill is being introduced which will revise existing methods of appointment, salaries and increments, methods of promotion, pension rates, &amp;c. this measure is being prepared by Mr. Brownrigg, a member of the mission, who has had long experience of similar work in the United States. An American field inspection system is being set up in the provinces to supervise in particular the administration of the Government’s commercial undertakings. Efforts are being made to improve methods of accounting and audit. A number of prosecutions for the misappropriation of public funds or property are already in hand. 20. Plainly the civil service, as it at present exists, is an inadequate instru ment for financial or any other administration. The mission is doing all that it can; but to create an efficient and honest public service might well take something like a generation, if indeed in Persia such a thing (without continuous and intensive foreign supervision) is possible at all. Prospective Position. 21. The resolutions of the Middle East Financial Conference held in Cairo during April cover fully the measures necessary in the countries concerned, including Persia, for (a) the balancing of the budget, {b) absorption of surplus purchasing power by taxation, internal loans and savings, and (c) the progressive reduction of prices. Persia was represented at the conference by a small delega tion headed by M. Ibtihaj, which was a party to all the resolutions passed; although there was at times a tendency on the part of each delegation, even the Persian, to regard the others as the only legitimate targets for criticism. 22. How far is Persia ready to face the changes which will take place in its economy at the end of hostilities with Germany, or indeed earlier, if the develop ment of the war in Europe makes it no longer necessary to use Persia as a transit route to Russia ? Dr. Millspaugh is fully alive to the situation. He has put in hand arrangements for post-war planning by the appointment of a variety of interlocking committees to cover the mam problems which will arise—involving, to use his own words, currency, foreign exchange, falling prices, foreign trade policy, budgetary readjustment, unemployment, settlement of claims, property transfers and internal security. The committees consist of Persian officials and members of the American Mission, together with Persian merchants and others in cases in which they are likely to be of use. 23. Although there is no doubt of the progress made by Dr. Millspaugh since he came to the country, both in laying the foundations required for financial reform and erecting in part the superstructure, there is much still to be put in hand. Persia can well stand higher rates of direct taxation than those now levied; and an increase is necessary to absorb purchasing power and stabilise prices. Methods of tax collection seriously need reform. Internal borrowing, alien as it is to the country’s tradition, needs to be tackled with greater success.( 6 ) As to prices, it appears likely that the peak has nearly or quite been reached. transport, which are coming into being as the result of Dr. Millspaugh’s powers of economic control, they should turn downward slowly. The effect, in addition, of the recent favourable war news has been to bring long-hoarded goods on to the market and materially to depress the prices of certain articles.( 7 ) All in ( 6 ) (a) The deposits in the Government Savings Bank were 146 million rials at the end of 1943_44 as against 54 million at the end of 194*2-43, a large increase but a very small total. (b) In September 1943 an issue of 500 million rials in Treasury bills was authorised—the first internal loan in Persian history. So far only about 160 million have been taken up, of which about 50 have been subscribed by Government departments. ( 7 ) Although the less scrupulous merchants have been spreading rumours of German successes in the hope of keeping prices up! and that with the improved methods of purchase and improved distribution andall, and given that in Persia it is necessary to hasten slowly, the financial mission has reason to be content with its work so far. 24. Further, the recent crisis caused by the resignation of Dr. Millspaugh and his colleagues, as the result of the Government’s proposal to deprive him of the economic powers given him by Parliament last autumn, has cleared the air. The Government have decided that for the present they cannot do without ^ him; nor could they face the probable displeasure of the United States Govern- ment with its possible practical effect on lease-lend supplies. In his turn Dr. Millspaugh proposed that he should appoint two members of his mission, Mr. Pixley and Mr. Black, as his deputies for finance and economic control respectively; this has been accepted, and he and his mission are remaining for the present with their existing powers. It has been a wise decision on both sides; and on the assumption that Dr. Millspaugh is able to carry on his work with only that modicum of opposition and interference which is to be expected in any case, it seems reasonable to take the view that within a year to eighteen months (although hardly earlier) the economy of Persia will be on a sufficiently stable basis for the country to face its future problems successfully. It is, however, indispensable to this success that there should be foreign advisers to guide it through the post-war period. E. N. R. TRENTHAM, Financial Counsellor.

I have the honour to address you as follows on (I) the revenue and expenditure of the ^ersidik Government for the year 1322 (March 21st, 1943. to'fflirch 20th,1944), which are covered in the enclosed copy of the report of the Administrator General of the Finances of Persia, Dr. Millspaugh, for the month of Farvardin, 1323 (March 21st to April 20th, 1944 ), and for the year 1322; and (II) the budget for the year 1323 (beginning on March 21st, 1944) which has recently been presented to the Majlis. I. Revenue and Expenditure for 1322 2. The report of Dr. Millspaugh, which may well be his last, follows on that for the month of Esfand (February 21st to March 20th, 1944). which was summarised in my despatch No .249 ( 252 / 8 / 44 ) of June 11th. It is, he states, deliberately brief and therefore in general terms owing to the lack of full printing facilities. It gives, however, a cool and balanced account of the financial and economic position in Persia as it existed when Dr. Millspaugh arrived in the country for the second time; of the difficulties which he and his Mission have experienced in carrying out the task for which they were engaged; and of the considerable extent to which these difficulties have been surmounted in the last fifteen months. 3# The following figures, taken from the report, show the outturn of the financial year 1322. That for 1321 and the original budget estimate for 1322 are given for comparison. Ordinary Expenditure ' Revenue • • • • (1) Actual 1321 (2) Actual 1322 (3) Estimate 1322 Million Rials 2,603 2,484 3,990 3.551 3,297 1,890 119 439 1,407 3,003 2,369 3.903 ^,970 5,896 5,795 634 933 101 5,606 4,853 7,893 6,521 9.193 7,685 753 1,372 1,508 Details of the figures given in columns (1) and (2) are not yet available.jmmercial budgets taken as a whole, the deficit for the year 1322 is very much as originally estimated even though some 34 ^ million rials were later added to the expenditure side of the Ordinary budget to provide increased salaries for Government servants# Owing to an underestimate of revenue and to the transfer of certain sums from the Commercial to the Ordinary budget, the deficit on this budget has been considerably less than estimated. On the other hand the Commercial budget has turned out badly o*ing to (a) the necessity for subsidising food stuffs and (b) the incompetent administration of the industrial undertakings operated by the Government# It was however recognised at the time the Commercial estimates were prepared that they were hardly more than conjectural. The Government industrial plants, says the report, have been 'sadly mismanaged”# Dr# Millspaugh’s proposals for their reorganisation were given in his report for the month of Bahman 1322, covered by my despatch No.217 (252/7/44) of May 18th. 5* It has to be added that the figures given in the third paragraph above are still not final. There is at present no Governmental audit system; and no Appropriation Accounts have been published within memory. There is said to be a 'Persian Accounts Tribunal” constituted for the pre paration of such accounts, but it is not known ever to have functioned. II. Budget for 1323 Tlle budget for 1323# as presented to the Majlis# Is as follows:- 9 Ordinary Budget Expenditure Revenue • • • • • • • • • • Deficit .. .. Million Rials 4.569 3,958 611 Commercial Budget Expenditure Revenue • . . . . . . . . . 5,755 6,367 612 Surplus .. .. The overall surplus is 470,391 rials. 7. As from the beginning of this year revenue and expenditure under the opium and tobacco monopolies are trans ferred from the Commercial to the Ordinary budget. The iigures for both taken together are:— Estimate Million Rials 1322 1323 Revenue .. Expenditure 1,051 258 1,425 359 tJ!- m Ttle “ ain increase in revenue for I 323 comes from Income iax, which is estimated to produce 885 million as—- 3 - (23^ compared with the estimate for 1322 of 290 ; owing, however, to expected delays in payment as the result of corresponding delays on the part of the Government in passing the tax regulations, Dr#Millspaugh has had additional direct taxation under consideration* There is also, apart from the increase in the receipts from opium and tobacco, an estimated ^ 111 million additional from the sugar and tea monopolies and an increase of 84 million from the export and import tax. As is to be expected the estimate for Customs receipts is reduced, from 234 million in 1322 to 183 million, in 1323* The yjo tax on goods brought into the municipalities (the estimated receipts for which were 150 million in 1322 ) is abolished, following on the introduction of higher income tax rates as from the beginning of the year. In general, it appears clear that the estimate of revenue is a conserva tive one. 9 . Expenditure under the Ordinary budget is placed at 4 , 3^9 million for 1323 as against the estimate for 1322 of 3,758. The estimates as originally put forward by the Departments have been cut by the Administrator General to the extent of 1,770 million. The principal cuts made have been 532 million from the Army estimates, 382 million from the estimates for the Gendarmerie and 77 million from those for the Police; the figures having been brought down to the 1322 estimates of 1 , 000 , 298 and 187 million respectively. It remains to be seen how far these cuts will survive the deliberations of the Majlis. Other reductions made in the departmental estimates are 45 million on the vote for the Ministry for Health, 108 on that for Education, 40 on that for Agriculture and 250 on the vote for Government Buildings. On each of these four votes, however, increases have been allowed on the estimates for 1322 of 40 (improved sanitation, and mobile dispensaries), 50 (provision of new schools), 23 and 50 million respectively. There are also increases in expenditure on the opium and tobacco monopolies which are more than offset by increased revenue (see paragraph seven above), of 40 million for staff required to administer the income tax regulations and of 64 million for communications. There is the novel provision in the budget bill that 'the payment of cost of living allowances to officials is dependent on the economies provided for in the estimates of each Ministry being faithfully carried outV 10. As stated in paragraph six, the Commercial budget shows a slight surplus of 612 million with revenue estimated at 6,367 million and expenditure at 5#755* This compares as follows with the figures for 1322 , the first year in which the separation into the Ordinary and Commercial budgets was made 1322 1322 Estimated Actual Revenue 5#795 2,970 Expenditure . ... 5,896 3,903 Deficit . ... 101 933 11. The figures as between 1322 and I 323 require, as stated earlier, certain adjustments owing to the transfe of the opium and tobacco monopolies to the Ordinary budget; transfer %but tlx© large discrepancy between the estimated and actual figures for 1322 shows the extreme difficulty experienced by the Financial Mission in forecasting the outcome of the trading and industrial undertakings of the Government. 12. In the Commercial budget for 1323 Dr* Millspaughl | has had in mind (a) price stabilisation and the Governmental ourchase and improved distribution of foodstuffs and other goods on a large scale, with a view to reducing prices, and incidentally in due course relieving the budget itself, and (b) the transfer to private enterprise of those undertakings which are not proper to Government control and the competent management of the remainder. Dr.Millspaugh*s resignation (given after long provocation, and assumed in the writing of this despatch to be final) will not only probably have the effect that his Commercial budget for 1323 becomes so much waste paper (unless it should so happen that he is adequately replaced) but will result in a maladministration which makes it impossible at the present stage to forecast the course of the budget for 1323 ns a whole. 13 . In the meantime, the Majlis has transferred the budget to its Budgetary Commission for consideration. The Commission have, it is understood, so far refused to approve it on the ground that the detailed estimates for Government Departments in the budget for the year 1322 have not been approved by them. 14 . The following Appendices are attached to this despatch A. Ordinary budget. Estimated revenue for 1322 and 1323. B. Ordinary budget. Estimated expenditure for 1322 and 1323 - C. Commercial budget.

A * T 2. In his introductory remarks Dr. Millspaugh point out that real progress is not possible without the effecMve co-operation of the Persian Government and of the Majlis, and that to have any prospect of success prompt action is essential to deal with the budgetary situation and price stabilisation. Still more A.merican assistants are required, and the prompt assent.of the Majlis to their engagement is requested. (D.o '4 hVty' 3. Ordinary expenditure of the Government during the / current financial year is estimated at 3,297,718,537 Rials, ^ and ordinary revenue at 1,890,795,096 Rials. These figures, which are exclusive of expenditure on or revenue from Government commercial enterprises or factories and of substantial stocks of gooes held by these institutions,reveal a deficit on ordinary account of 1,406,923,441 Rials. If tie possibility of the need for all-round increases of salaries of Government employees is taken into consideration, the deficit would amount to about 1,900,000,00.0. The Income- Tax Bill is still being held up.by the Majlis, and even after it has been approved it will be some considerable time before it becomes effective. There has been a deficit at the end of each month of the year so far, and meanwhile a revolving fund of 500,000,000 Rials is required to finance : grain purciases. Help from out si ie has been required, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has agreed to make advances against this year’s oil royalties. Allied Governments hive been asked for an advance of 500,000,000 Rials to finance grain purchases, and the Persian Government have been advised to seek an external loan sufficient to renay this advance and to cover r the entire deficit for the year.’ His figures, Dr. Millspaugh states, are subject to revision, but 'the gloomy outlines of the financial picture can be seen v.ith essential clarity'. v 4. On the.expenditure.side, every effort had been made by Dr. Millspaugh to keep down the budgets of the various Ministries to a minimum. Large increases of expenditure for agricultural or economic development, health or education will not be possible, together with the regrettable necessity of postponing its enactment until the financial situation . of the country has been restored. ‘l m r~- 1 &gt; 5. In the field of price stabilisation claims that satisfactory progress has be organisation and administration of the Stabilisation, that speculation has less or ices lias been checked or slowed down, psychological factors in inflation have &gt; Right Honourable Anthony Eden, DC., M.P., etc., etc., etc., His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, N LOT DON, -S. W. 1. , Dr. Millspaugh en made in the ection of Price ened, the rise in and that 'the changed for the better' /(One ... W. 1.(One can only hope thai this optimism is justified; to the layman the signs are not very clear). A Pharmaceutical Institute, the report continues, is in operation; a Government store for the sale of goods is being prepared and stocks accumulated for sale to the public; a Supply and Service Corporation is being established to co-ordinate * Government requirements and procurements. The intention is expressed to co-operate with private merchants so that they may continue, so far as practicable, to import and export at 'a fair profit’. A measure of control over Government and private motor vehicles, spare parts and tyres, has been achieved. Sale of gold and silver is being;- effected. An Administration of Industrial Supervision has been set up to deal with factories and mines, and the organisation of the Road Trainsoort Deoartment is being improved. These- measures alone are not expected to stabilise prices, but t ney will be suo.plemented with* emergency texact ion and internal borrowing. 6. Together with its predecessors, the Report gives a clear picture, of the unsatisfactory financial position of Persia to ay, and sets forth some of the proposed remedies. In spite of all *he measures initiated by Dr. Mil'lspaugh since his arrival,, it is in fact difficult to see any essential improvement in any direction. This is no doubt due to a large extent to the lack of co-operation by Government and Majlis to which the Report refers, but it is also a fact that, in Persia to-day, it is easier to pass w r ell- intentioned Regulations than to get them implemented. There is also a suggestion that team work between Dr. Millspaugh and his American,colleagues is not as close as it might be, and this co-operation and mutual confidence, will be even more essential if, as is intended, the team is to be considerably augmented. I have sent copies of this despatch with enclosures to the Minister of State, Cairo: to His Majesty 1 s Ambassadors at Washington, Moscow and Bagdad; to the Government of India and to the Department of Overseas Trad'S*. r 4 ———* I have the honour to be etc. etc. etc. (signed) R. W. BULLARD.pi3 It is to be expected that in the undeveloped eountdlgtee or the Middle 3ast the Government will be obliged to rely in great part for its revenue on the produce of indirect taxation, but in Persia the principle has been unscrupulously pushed beyond the bounds of decency, not so much because of the administrative difficulties that beset the collect ion of direct taxes as because the legislature and the administration are recruited from th&lt;fese sections of the community on whom direct taxation would main ly fall. (c) ’Profits on Government Trading’ (item C.a) of Re ceipts in the Summary above) constitute another large element of indirect taxation, and this item throws still more into relief the unfair incidence of taxation as between the rich and the poor. (I have reason to believe that the receipts from this source are grossly over-estimated at Rials 1,040 millions. But the argument is unaffected even if the yield is only half of the estimate.^ (d; Of the total of Rials 2,299.48 millions allocated to the ’Supply’ Services, 40' is accounted for by the following three items:-. Army 700.— Gendarmerie ••••••••• 150.— j olice 90.— T otal: .... 94lT.-~ Note s Tho admin!etrative coats of the Ministry of the Interior appropriate to the Gendarmerie, and the costs of adminis t^^ing the Conscription Law are not included in the aboye figures. While it is to be expected that the costs of maintaining security in a country still largely in habited by a tribal population will absorb a large part of the national budget, there is no doubt that Persia does not get anything like value for the sum she expends on her security services. A conscript army on the continental model is a luxury and an ex travagance, and the existence side by side of two forces, the Army aid the Gendarmerie (neither of which is ever likely to be needed, or to be effective, for any purpose except the maintenance of internal law and order) is wasteful in the extreme. Dr.Mi11s- paugh has his eye on the Army A&gt;timates, but he will encounter much onposltion from the Palace to any at tempt at retrenchment. (e) The provision of Rials 54.41 millions for the Ministry of Health and of Rials 177.30 millions for the Ministry of Education (a total of Rials 331.71 millions) in dicates how little of the proceeds of the Government’s exactions from the people goes back to them in the form of Goeial Services. 7. Dr.Millspaugh informs me that he is determined that the Budget for the coming year shall be balanced. He says ho can achie* achieve this only by substantial cuts in expenditure and by substant ial increases in taxation. He thinks that indirect taxation is at as high a level as the country can stand, and ha therefore proposes to introduce new measures of direct taxation. Pawed as he is with the need to increase taxation in order to balance the Budget, it is unlikely that he will find it possible politically to introduce further taxation for debt extinction on any serious scale or for loans to the Allied Governments. The utmost that can be looked for from the forthcoming Budget, by way of a contribution towards arresting inflation, is, therefore the extent of the relief that will/. &lt; ■i No.£29 &amp;.

The dividends paid in 1315 and 1316 (1936-1938), representing respectively 35.1 and 26.7 per cent of the paid up capital, give an impression of making hay v/hile the sun shines, and, indeed, such figures are not likely to recur in view of the recent considerable increases in income tax. It may safely be presumed that the Rial values of capital invested in United Kingdom companies, as shown in Table No.2, have been handled carelessly.

' April IX, 1939. 959 J Section 1. Copy No. 115 Mr. Seymour to Viscount Halifax.—(Received April 11.) (No. 80 E.) My Lord, Tehran, March 16, 1939. WITH reference to Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 93 E. of the 9th March, 1938, I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith extracts^) from the &lt;/ ournal de Tehran giving details and estimates of the budget for the Iranian year 1318 (the 22nd March, 1939, to the 21st March, 1940), which was approved by the Majlis on the 5th March. 2. For the first time since 1928—29 a deficit is revealed, which is larger than the total expenditure in 1928-29. Estimates of expenditure in the coming year, apart from credits from State reserves in sterling, amount of 2,613,481,987 rials (£32,668,525 at the official rate of 80 rials to the £), and revenue is estimated at 1,930,096,700 rials (£24,126,210), leaving a deficit of 683,385,287 rials (£8,542,316). 3. On the revenue side it will be noted that receipts from the sugar and tea monopoly tax, as well as the road tax, are now included in the ordinary budget, increasing the revenue from customs and from monopolies. 4. Lomparative lists of the chief sources of revenue and of the chief headings of expenditure herewith transmitted show the increases over the hgures of the previous budget. Attention may be drawn to the estimated increase in indirect taxation, though direct taxation remains at the same figure. Estimated revenue from industries is increased by 20 million rials from the tar and sleeper factory, 10 million rials from “ Factory No. 5,” which is thought to be the gas mask factory, and 10 million rials from the glycerine and soap factory. 5. On the expenditure side, the outstanding increase is for roads and communications, the new estimates amounting to 853,550,000 rials (£10,669,376), or about 33 per cent, of the total expenditure. A sum of 150 million rials (£1,875,000) for the Administration of Mines and for iron and brass foundries brings the estimates for the Ministry of Industry and Mines to 455,430,000 rials (£5,693,000), or about 17 per cent, of the total. Sixty million rials have been added to the estimates for the Ministry of War, bringing the total up to 415,408,380 rials (£5,192,600), representing about 16 per cent, of the total expenditure: to this may be added the credit out of reserves of £2 million. 6. To meet the declared deficit it is stated that 140 million rials will be available from the sale of the cotton mill at Behshahr (late Ashraf), which, it is understood, has been purchased by the Shah, payment to be made by instalments. A further sum of 160 million rials “ en devises etrangeres ” is to help to diminish the deficit: it would appear that half of this sum (or £1 million) is to come out of reserves—out of which £2 million has already been earmarked for the Ministry of War and £1 million for the railway and ports. The other half is to be raised by long-term credits. The rest of the deficit is to be covered bv unforeseen receipts, revenue from commercial enterprises of the State and by borrowings from banks in the country. I have heard of the possibility of an increase in income tax on large profits, that‘is to say, that the present rate of 4 per cent, on such profits may be raised considerably. 7. A copy of the Bill for the supplementary law to the budget, published on the 9th March, is also furnished herewith^ 1 ) 8. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. H. J. SEYMOUR.
