Sir, With reference to my circular despatch W 6716/20/49 of the 29th April, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith, an addendum to the memorandum on anti-sabotage precautions enclosed therein* 2. This addendum is not being issued direct to masters ani shipowners of British vessels, and is for your own information. 3. Additional copies of this circular are enclosed for transmission to the Consular Officers under your superintendence. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, ALEXANDER CADOGAK. His Majesty’s Consular Officers at maritime ports. 172/1940) 11160 21706 - 4( V 9772/20/49 ) Enclosure. ANTI-SABOTAGE PRECAUTIONS. Addendum to Memorandum dated January i t 1940. (M.O. 1767/39). Possible Methods of Sabotage. 1. Investigation of two recent cases of sabotage of British merchant ships in foreign ports has revealed the following facts. In each case an explosive charge fitted with a delay action fuse was probably concealed in a package, part of a consignment of similar packages Kttk which formed part of the ship^ cargo. These were a container of strawbex'ry pulp and a case of canned beef. The loading ports were a Bulgarian port and Buenos Aires respectively. 2. Information has been received that bombs or incendiary devices may be concealed in the following objects which, although not part of the ship’s cargo, may be placed on board by enemy agents in the hope that they may be overlooked:- Tea canteens, thermos flasks, water bottles, jam jars and similar articles, containing explosives set off by delay action fuse. Packing cases, specially treated to make them inflammable and liable to spontaneous combustion. Portmanteaux or trunks delivered on board immediately before sailing and purporting to belong to a passenger or member of the crew. Clothes, rags or dunnage, pretreated to render them inflammable and ignited by an acid capsule secreted among them. These clothes, &amp;c., have a dusty or greyish appearance owing to the chemical treatment. Lactometers, fountain pens and coloured pencils may be small incendiary bombs with delay action. Imitation lumps of coal, briquettes, &amp;c., containing xx explosives. Lead objects in the shape of a cigar containing an incendiary liquid and a delay action fuse. Lubricating oil to which a substance has been added which will cause the oil to catch fire when the engines are xtxx started. It will be appreciated that no list of this nature can fee. possibly be exhaustive, and therefore objects which do not appear on the list are not for that reason to be regarded as free from suspicion. Bombs have been discovered which consist of two cartons of cardboard, 4-£-in. by 2£-in. containing sulphur and Jjotassftun nitrate. These charges are ignited by means of a percussion cap operated by a small watch which has a maximum delay of one hour, rhese are contained in a brass cylinder which may be inserted in one end of the carton or between two cartons. Only by exercising the strictest vigilance can such attempts at sabotage be prevented.Additional Precautions. 3. attention ie drawn to the following additional precautions to prevent sabotage. These should be applied particularly as regards loading at night, with full regard to the necessity of clearing vessel:; from port with the minimum delay. Precautions in Case of Passengers - All agents of passenger carrying vessels, before booking a passenger, should take stringent precautions to see that the documents of the passenger are absolutely in order, and if in doubt obtain Consular advice. Passengers baggage should, if considered necessary, be opened and examined before it is stowed away. 5. Pilots- Particular scrutiny should be kept on pilots and masters warned against any considered suspect, a special pilot must be chosen whenever any doubt exists as to the integrity of the one appointed. 6. Check on Chip’s Stores. Master should, when obtaining Utx&amp;x stores in foreign ports, required the ship’s chandler who is supplying them to provide his delivery men with passes signed by him. a notice should be hung near the gangway, giving the name of the chandler concerned, and the watchman should not allow any men to bring stores on board unless they are provided with such passes. The Oificer in charge of receipt of stores should carefully check all stores and as far as possible examine them for signs of tiering or interference. 7. Ship’s Ventilators and Portholes- While the ship is in port ventilators should be sealed down or otherwise protected, and all portholes closed or protected, in such a manner as to prevent any material which x could be of danger to ship or cargo being introduced through them. 8. Wire netting grid. When loading grain in bulk by cutting bags on the. hatch, a wire netting grid must be suspended in the hatchway. This sh uld be supplied by the stevedores. 5. Night Work. &lt;*8 a general rule there is no objection to discharging at night. Masters and agents with the help of Consular advice, should as far as possible satisfy themselves that employees and labourers who board a vessel loading at night do not carry any sabotage material and that all precautions that would be taken in daylight are strictly carried out. Bales of wool, hair or cotton, grain - grain offals'and oilcakes in bags should, not, if possible be loaded during dark hours. Night bundering is undesirable. If. 5742/40.
