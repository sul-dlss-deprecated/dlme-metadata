Will you please refer to your demi-official letter Ho. P 8,' dated the 19th August 1945, on the subject of Bahrain Development and connected questions. The action proposed in paragraph 6 of your letter is approved. In addition you could perhaps stress that the removal of the power house to a central site, together with the installation of a suitable plant to avoid the mushroom plants otherwise likely to be installed by the Services, is an urgent matter; that the people of Bahrain, now grown rich owing to various factors, have the right to the attention of the State in regard-to their comfort and the provision of the every-day amenities of life, that electricity is one such, and that students and others returning from Egypt will not tolerate miserly tactics when the State is known to be overflowing with money; and that similar considerations apply to road construction and repairs.

X have had a word with Smith this morning about the electricity here. He tells me that the peak demand during this hot weather has been for 312 to 315 kilowatts while the existing generators were only able to give 250 kilowatts. They are installing a new generator at the moment and Leigh hopes to be able to have a second new one in by May next and then to be able to generate 600 kilowatts to meet an estimated (optimistically framed) peak load of 400 kilowatts. If these arrangements materialise, you will see that there will be a 50 per cent reserve which is thought to be adequate. Smith does not think the removal of the power house will then be necessary. In the circumstances, I doubt whether we can reasonably press for it. Yours sincerely, • ■ % 'Honourable Lieutenant colonel A.C.

Under local conditions this would be reduced to 12 years. The date of obsolescence'would therefore 1 be sometime during 1942 in each case. This period has been confirmed by competent engineers in BAPGO.^ From actual running data which has not been recorded but simply memorised, it is apparent that these two sets v/ere able to generate the normal percentage of their rated output until 1943. They therefore became obsolescent after 13 years service during 1943. No.3 set of a rated output of 200 K.W^was installed in 1938 and put into service in June,1938. This set rttould have an estimated life of 12 years under local conditions of running and maintenance. From runping data -which has not been recorded but only memorised ^ it is apparent that this set first showed signs of deterioration in 1943 when it was only able to generate 85$ of its rated output. This figure was reduced to 80$ in 1944 and to 65^&gt; in 1945. The date of obsolescence of No.3 set could therefore be assumed to have been sometime previous to 1943. (bi No steps were taken to replace Nos. I, 2 and 3 sets before the appointment of the present State Engineer but an order for a f OTth generating set of 206 K.W. capacity was placed in 1943 to provide increased load requirements only. This fexeth sot is now in process of installation and should be ready for service before the next hot season commences subject to the arrival of several deficient components from the makers. Action for the replacement of the first three sets c was first taken in December,1944 when the present State Engineer discussed with the Adviser the necessity of ordering four 300 K.W.sets as an entire replacement for the then existing plant and additional capacity for increased load requirements over a period of 5 years. The first of'these 300 K.W. sets is now firmly on order, and no application to the Agency for assistance in obtaining has been required or requested.

I have now been informed by Air Headquarters, * Iraq that while the policy regarding R*A*F. Station Bahrain has not been finally promulgated the poss ibility of the Bahrain Government taking over the power house can be consid ered. The following figures have been forwarded as a guide to such preliminary consideration. 5. The Power House building was designed and constructed to accommodate the following plant 2/250 K.W. Generating Sets, (in transit from U.K.) f] C . Ac ■ &lt; A rough estimate of costs has been made as a guide and the Bahrain Allow 20$ contingency r say £5^,000. It is emphasized that these figures are for guidance only. A* It is unlikely that the R.A.F. requirements are now going to warrant the installation of the 2/250 K.W. seta so that these sets could probably be disposed of as a store. On the other hand if representations were made to Air Ministry it is possible, in view of the special conditions at Bahrain, that the Air Ministry Works Directorate, • Iraq, would be prepar ed to install the sets for the Bahrain Government. It is probable that this and any other equivalent work required by the Bahrain Government would be charged at cost to the Directorate plus an establishment charge. 5* If it is decided to continue to use the R.A.F.

March 1946, enclosing a letter from the ASLO abo electrical plant. 2. The Bahrain G-overnment wishes to buy the tw 250 K.W. sets vvhich are in transit from the United Kingdom. 3. As you are aware the State Engineer recently visited Hassa to advise the local Government about installing electricity in Hofuf. In his opinion the three 135 K.W. sets referred to in para 6 of ASLO r s letter would be eminently suitable for the requirements of Hassa and if the R.A.F. authorities would agree to this plant being sold to Hassa this new undertaking would be able to acquire plant at once which if ordered in England would most likely take a very long time to materialise. I understand that the Hassa concern is anxious to buy British material. I am told that they refused the help and advise of Aramco in this matter because this assistance was conditional upon American material being installed. 4. If the Bahrain Government acquires the two 250 K.W. sets our generating position will be as follows Now installed and being installed four sets, No. 1, 2, 3 and 4. Sets 1 and 2 are 15 years* old. Set 3 is 10 years* old. Set 4 is new and will be running almost immediately. They are rated as follows:- Sets 1 and 2. JDO K.W. each. Actual output 65 K.W. each. Set 3. Set 4. 200 K.W. Actual output 150 K.W 206 K.W. Actual output 206 **In addition we have on order No. 5. Set 5. 500 K.W. Actual output 300 K.W. If we acquire the two 250 K.W. sets from the R.A.F. the total rated capacity will be 1406 and the actual capacity 1286. ISxcluding sets No. 1 and 2, which are no longer economical to run, the actual capacity will be 1206 K.W, which is slightly more than our total estimated require ments for the next five years. 5. Before giving a definite reply about the Power House building in Muharraq and the smaller engines I should like a conference to be held between the R.A.F. Officers, myself and the State Engineer, as suggested P 71 in the ASLO’s last paragraph. Any date suitable to the R.A.F. will suit us.

It is understood that the plant in question is now in Transit from the United Kingdom and it is presumed that delivery could be made direct from 'ship to the Government Power House* as the voltage rating of the plant is 440 Volts, two step up transformers will in addition be required in order that the alternator may be coupled direct on to the existing 3,300 Volt Mains system. If these could be supplied from R.A,F. sources on a repayment basis it would preclude the necessity of ordering them from out side sources* With regard to the projected Electricity Supply Undertaking in Hassa, Sua.di Arabia for which ^ I recommended the purchase from the R.A#F* of KW Generating Sets which had been tentatively offered for sale. It is now understood that these'will not be available owing to Indefinite local R.A.F. requirements, but alter- . natively, 4/50 KW Sets have become surplus. These would probably suffice in the initial stage of the project and their combined rated output of 200 KW is the equivalent of the Bahrain Government’s initial installation. It is requested that full details of the engirB s, ancillary plant and generators together the cast may bb supplied in order that these may be forwarded to Saudi Arabia, also precise instructions as to the method of application for purchase by the undertaking concerned. oTHE OFFICE OF THE AIR 3TAFF LIAISON OFFICER, BAHRAIN. 6th.

In the new K.A.F./B.O.A.C. Agreement we are ashed to guarantee an emergency supply for R.A.F. Muharraq of 100 K.W. Owing to the delay in receipt of our spares for the three old engines' from England and increased local demands, most of which we have refused, it will not be pessible to supply the R.A.F. emergency demand without curtailing local supply. Would it be possible for you to use this as an argument for asking the R.A.F. to agree to cancelling their demand for 100 K.W. emergency supply for Muharraq ? Lieut. Colonel A.C. Galloway, O.B.F., H.

Adviaerata, January 24, 1948. Dear Dredge, I have seen your letter No.109-15/14 dated 20th January 1948 to Leigh on the subject of electric current. We are in an extremely difficult positihn ourselves, owing to the loss of 200 K.W. due to the bteak down of our 200 K.W. generating set^. Although we have lately installed a new 300 K.W. set we are only able to meet the existing demands by borrowing 80 K.W. from the R.A.7. at Muharraq. We have now been informed by the R.A.F. that their supply will have to cease on 15th February as the R.A.F. plant is also in a precarious position and is shutting dovm for repairs on that date. Another one of our engines, installed 21 months ago, has been run continuously since it was put on* It is absolutely essential that this engine should be shut down for replacement of worn parts immediately on their arrival m from Bngland. We are having the greatest difficulty in obtaining quick delivery of these spares, they should have been shipped before Christmas but in spite of three cables asking the probable date of shipment we have no word of their being dispatched. When these spares do arrive it will take, at a minimum, 14 days to fit them. 2. In addition to our existing commitments we have demands from new consumers amounting to over 94 K.W. which include supplies to Cable and Wireless, a number of government buildings. His Highness's property, hospitals, flour mills, work shops and many shops and houses. All these places have been wired and are awaiting connection. In addition we have about 150 2 / ConfidentiaL &lt;i&gt; ....- 2 - additional applications for other buildings which have bean refused permission for wiring, owing to our present inability to supply power* 3. A further generating set of 300 K.W. capacity was promised by the makers for delivery here in September 1947* Owing to delays in England we are now informed by the makers that they will not be able to ship this set till March 1948 and the switchgear for the set will be delayed for another eight months. This will mean that when the new engine is Installed we shall have to run it on an existing switch board panel which will only allow us to generate 200 K.W. instead of 300 K.W. 4 . I am explaining our position in full in order that you can realise that it isat present extremely difficult for us to give you any help. We are prepared however to supply you 10 K.W. continuously,for as long as we can, until we begin to carry out the repairs on the engine which I have mentioned above. If by any unfortunate chance the spares do not arrive before we lose 80 K*W. which is now being provided by the R.A.F. we should have to discontinue supplying you until our repairs are completed. We propose to do as much repair work as possible while we are still on the R.A.P. supply, but we cannot shut down the engine until we know that the spares are on the way. Major A.L.A.

KV-w- V tXLj When Belgrave came to see me recently I called his attention to the great discontent that would be caused by a continued inadequate supoly of electricity during the hot weather. I have asked him to let me have direct details of the equipment required with a view to asking His Majesty's Government's assistance in expediting its supply. C.J. Pelly, esquire, O.B.E., Political Agent, BAHRAIN. . Confjiantia!. B AJn A &gt; IT nor mam MU No. 818 &gt; 15 /$, My dear Burrows, mtSIAN GULF RiuoIDKKCY. BAHRAIN. 22nd March, 1948. $ r ® I forward herewith ©note prepared by Belgrave on the Bahrain electricity su ply. I are afraid the note is rather iengtny but the gist of it is that unless the alternator and switch-gear referred to in paragraph 8 can be delivered within the next three months the new set mentioned in paragraphs 3 to 6 cannot be Installed and Bahrain will have to face another hot weather with an Inadequate electric supply. 2. nt present very few refrigerators and no air conditioning sets are allowed to be operated in Manama and the current Is switched off for several hours per day owingr to the Inadequate supply. Similar conditions have prevailed for several years except during 194b. The situation is due largely to luck of fore-sight and imperfect planning by the Bahrain authorities. At jufair we have our own generating set end are not affected wy but the personnel of the Agency and the general public in Manama and Muharraq suffer severely. The lack of fans and refrigeration in the hot weather naturally brings tne Bahrain Government in general and its British officers in particular into disrepute and is calculated to cause that type of irritation and discontent which leads to disorders. 3. Although the situation is the result of the inefficiency or indolence of the Bahrain authorities I think in the circumstances described in the last aaragraph we should do our best to rescue thorn from their difficulties. I should therefore be most grateful for any assistance that H.i.G. can give in ensuring (a) that the 300 K.W. sat which is on the programme for completion at the end of .March vide paragraph 6 of nelgrave's letter is comdieted and despatched at once and (b) that the alternator and switch-gear for this engine vide paragraph 8 of 3elgrave*s letter are completed and despatched not later than lay. 4. I should also be grateful if an endeavour could be made to ensure that the delivery of the two additional 360 K..V. sets referred to as Nos. 7 avid 8 sots vide paragraph 9 of Belgrave*s letter is effected by February 1949. 6. Could you kindly let me know as soon as :x)ssible the result of any action taken on paragraph 3 above. B.a.B. Burrows, Esq., Foreign Office, LONDON . Copy to P.A., Bahrain. / Yours sincerely, Sd. W.R. Hay. Confidential. !EIPT./ n BAHRAIN RECEI .Date. ~ n—rt iiNote on the Bahrain Electric Supply This time last year we had four sets in working order giving a total output of 606 KW which was sufficient to supply the demand for electricity at that time. On 16th August 1947, the crankshaft of one of the sets, barely ten years old, broke during running. Thisentailed a loss of 200 KW and left us with the two original engines, now nearly 20 years old, and a 206 KW set which had been brought into service in April 1946. These three sets were not capable of carrying the summer load and we therefore made arrangements with the R.A.F. to supply us with 100 KW which was all that they could provide. The R.A.F. supply was subsequently reduced to 80 KW and finally, on 18th February 1948, it was diecontinued at the request of the R.A.F. 2. On 6th January 1948 we brought into service e new 300 KW let. Our total rated output, with this set, was 706 KW but the actual output was only 530 KW. This difference was mainly due to the low factor of mechanical efficiency of the two original sets and also the decreasing efficiency of the set which was installed in April 1946 which had been kept running continuously, without a shut down for essential routine maintenance. Continuity of supply could fe not be maintained if this set was shut down. * 3. In June 1946 wte had placed an order through British Insulated Callender’s Cables Ltd., with whom wo have been dealing since this Company originally Installed electricity in Bahrain, for a new 300 KW set, Mirrlees - Metrovick, BHT switchgear. We were informed that the engine would be ready in 65 weeks, (by April 1947) and that the alternator would be ready in 9 - 10 months (about April 1947). 4. We pressed the supplier for an earlier delivery, but with no success and after incessant enquiries, telegrams and letters Callenders informed us, on 6th August 1947, that the new set was nearing completion and should be ready for ship ment during September 1947. This was a delay of about five a months over their original estimate. 6. We continued to press for earlier delivery. At the end of October 1947 we were informed that there had been a further delay in the dispatch date of the set but they expected to have the set ready for shipment by the end of January or early February 1948. 6 . 6. In a letter dated 17th February 1948, of which I enclose caf xfcigk 1 r a copy, Callenders stated that the engine was on the programme for completion at the end of March, but the alternator, which was being made by Metro-Vic (Metropolitan Vickers) would not be completed before October 1948. The explanation was that Metropolitan Vickers had found it necessary to review the whole of their commitments as they were late with deliveries and so their delivery promises had to be extended drastically. The engine without the Alternator is useless. They suggested that we should waive combined trials and owing to the urgency of ouy need we agreed to do so. 7. In addition to the sets referred to above we have on order two 350 KW sets, complete, which are promised for delivery in June 1949, from Mirrlees - Brush. We have also ordered a 55 KW generating plant, complete, which we expect to receive here in April/May 1948. Small sets of this type are not an kx economical proposition but we have ordered/ —i- ■ ordered this t one in order to reliwye the situation during the hot weather* These sets are readily available as special material has been allocated for their production for export and for home supply* 8 . What will relieve the situation is if the delivery of the Alternator and switchgear for No* $ engine, which was originally ordered in June 1946, from Metropolitan Vickers and British Thoms on-Houston, now promised for October 1948, can be accelerated. The engine will be installed as soon, as it arrives but until its alternator and switchgear are here it cannot be used* If the alternator and switchgear cou^d be delivered at the same time as the engine we could immediately supply all demands except one unusually large demands, by the B*0.A*C*, for their new premises, which can only be supplied when we have Nos^7 and 8 set£ in working order. 9* If the delivery of Nos. 7 and 8 sets, each of 350 KW., now promised for June 1949, could be brought forward by four months these two sets would be working in time to cater for the summer of 1949 and for all future requirements for some years to come. With four new engines installed, after scrapping the three old ones, we shall hsve 1561 KW. The maximum, demand recorded in 1947 was 421 KW. and the maximum demand this year, during cold weather, was 396 KW. but we have about 250 new applications for current in houses, shops and business premises. 10. Since last month, owing to the incessant delays in deliveries, we have ceased from placing orders through Callenders and are dealing direct with the manufacturers.No, 1317-15/6.

It is suggested that if he sees no objection this should be communicated to Mr. Belgrave. t- Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian GulfD.O.No.C/R-88. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 24th June, 1948. Dear Sir Rupert, You may have seen the Bahrain Governments notice dated the 21st June, 1948, announcing the 'shut down” in the electricity supply. The last reference I have from you about it is your endorsement No.1340- 15/G, dated the 19th May, 1948. S SH- 2. To my certain knowledge , complaints and warnings to the State authorities about the electricity supply, have, for the last four years, been either disregarded or met with a smoke-screen of technicalities - usually followed up by a barrage of wishful thoughts. A par ticularly good example of what I mean will be apparent from my D.O.No.C/905, dated the 22nd September, 1945 r — £ in which.I told Galloway how I had been ridden off my suggestion that the power house should be removed and set up on a central site, 3. In a Municipal undertaking in England or in any commercial organisation, break-downs in the power supply might be forgiven once, but the Engineer in charge would not escape responsibility for their constant recurrence. It is at last time for us to refuse to be put off, by the excuse that the delivery of equipment is so long delayed. This of course is true, but it does not explain why No.5 engine which was installed only in January last should now be out of order owing a seized up piston. The further excuse that it was overloaded merely suggests a further question His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.question as to why it was overloaded. Belgrave has throughout shown a lack of foresight due to the fact, I think, that he is unable to face the expenditure which would have been involved in a scheme providing for needs only foreseeable in the future. But these constant break-downs argue inefficiency on the part of Leigh, or that he has not got enough staff - which comes to the same thing, as he has never complained of short ages in that respect. 4. Belgrave is looking for a replacement for Leigh, but, in order to try to escape from this chronic elec tricity headache, I think the considerations I have just mentioned as to Leigh*s work should be put before Belgrave and he should be asked to insure that a reason able time after his appointment -Leigh’s successor certifies that he has adequate, adequately paid, and efficient staff, and that all possible arrangements have been made to ensure sufficient electricity supply within a stipulated time; or alternatively he should state what his require ments to that end are and he should also report on the suggestion to transfer the power station to a central site where the remaining efficient generators in the old /()* station, and the 4 sets under order would be installed. 690-15/11, dated the 11th March, 1948, is now an actual fact and I should be grateful, if there is no objection, if you would again take up the case with Belgrave on the lines I have suggested. had a talk with Bloodworth of Cable and Wireless who was here on a short visit. He tells me that the time in The discontent referred to by you in your D.O.No 6 I wrote the above yesterday and since then have which£ -3- which his Corporation contracted with the Automatic Telephone Company Limited to instal the new telephone system in Bahrain is getting short and that in order to avoid breaking their contract Cable and Wireless have had to spend over £300/- on the purchase of a small generator to supply electricity merely for the instal lation work of the telephone system. He also said that in 1946 he offered to help Leigh to obtain generrtors from England, but Leigh stated that the only help required was in obtaining a compressor in which Bloodworth had no interest. A more serious matter for the present is that the local electricity supply instead of being at about 230 volts is merely giving 180 to 190 volts to the transmitting station of Cable and Wireless. The result is that for the last few days they have been unable to transmit any message and have been receiving them f blind* (without acknowledging) from London and other outside stations. As I am sure you will agree the break-down in wireless communication will result in serious reper cussions from the Oil Company’s and other interests, I think Belgrave should also be warned about this.

He said that he would write to Clear, who is Mirrlees* Middle-East Repre' seatafcive, and would ask him to come here to give an independent opinion on the staff and equipment needed to ?ive an adequate electricity supply in view of foreseeable requirements. Brammer, the P.C.L. Engineer, whom Belgrave interviewed, might take the place of Leigh, but I gather he is rather frightened of the size of the job and is going to think about whether he will take it on or not. Belgrave seemed to tend to the opinion that more European assistance is required and this may well be the case.

We have had discussions on the inadequacy of the electric supply in Bahrain, and the situation also has changed since the receipt of your letter, making a reply possibly unnecessary. 3. A particular remark I might, however, now make is that I think that Belgrave does not take the interest in the electrical department of the State that he should. My guess at the reason for this is that it is in such a rotten state that he wishes to hide behind us by maintaining that we provide the engineers - we have found Steele and Leigh in the past - and that his hands are, therefore deem but tied. 4. I think Belgrave should be made to understand, if this is possible, the grave reflection on his ability as a financial adviser, which is his real appointment, which follows on his parsimoniousness in withholding full support from a productive and, if properly run, profit- making department of State business C.J.

C L E A R Bahrain, September 2, 1948* ^ \ , REPORT ON THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY OF BAHRAIN . # General , At the request of the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., I arrived in Bahrain on August 30th to make some investigations into the Elec tricity Supply Undertaking which is owned and administered by the Government of Bahrain. The original of this report will be handed to the Adviser. Survey of the Electricity Supply 1944-48 . Reliable gigures can only be obtained from 1944 onwards. The previous five years being war years would not, in fact, illustrate growing demand accurately. I have drawn graphs which are attached to this report summarising the five years under review. The graphs show generated peak loads, total installed power, future installed power and total future estimated demand against a Time basis.n Certain conclusions can be drawn from the graphs immediately. Firstly, the Power Station was heavily over loaded in the summers of 1944 and 1945, although supplies were taken from the R.A.F. Power Station at this time. Secondly, the hot months of May to September nearly always show the maximum power requirement to be in August. It will be seen that this August peak has increased in the five years under review:- 1944 - 308 KW, 1945 - 316 KW, 1946 - 2 /—3 /~ 388 KY/, 1947 - 421 KW, 1948 - 475 KW. During this time total installed power has remained steady at 260 KW until April 1946. At this time No. 4 set (206 KW) was installed giving a total of 466 KW« This continued until September 1947 when No. 3 set broke a crankshaft putting it permanently out of commission. The installation of No. 5 set four months later brought the total up to 586 KW. Finally, in August 1948 another 50 KW was installed - this being a temporary measure - bringing the total installed capacity on 12 hour rating up to 636 KW today. Details are as follows No. 1. No. 2. No. 3. No. 4. No. 5. Original Mirrleex Set which was giving 50 KWfnow 40 KW. As No.l At pre sent being removed. Mirrlees UL over hauled April 206 KW Mirrleee HFB4 Metrowlet 300 KW. To be re placed by No. 7 - To be replaced by No. 8 No. 6 set to go in, Mirrlees/ set, iden- identi- Brush 350 tical to cal No.5 KW set. No. 7. In addition one McLaren/Brush set of the standard 55 KW type developing approximately 50 KW at site conditions. An additional set is on site to be connected when the coolers of Nos. 1 and 2 sets are removed.4 /— - 3 - Knom Additional Demands August 1948 , In addition to the 475 KW maximum demand the following definite applications for light add power have been made. These havd been separated into applications from Companies.and Large organizations such as B.O.A.C., Cable and Wireless, Imperial Bank of Iran, Gray Mackenzie Ltd., etc., and app lications from private individuals and shopkeepers. Additional demands from large organizations 742 KW Additional demands from private individuals 168 ' Total • • • • 910 KW Thus the present peat of 475 should be able to cope with 1385 KW. This is not altogether correct as some of the applications are not requiring supply immediately. Distribution factor is estimated at nearly unity, for in all cases the requirements^of which will be switched on at the same time. Plant Changes . As already shewn, discernible by the graph, Nos. 1 and 2 sets are to be removed thus reducing output by 80 KW. This should be possible in October, and the second 50 KW set will go in during the following month. Thus November of this year will show 606 KW of capacity installed. Mean while No. 6 set (300 KW) and the cooling tower will be in course of erection, and in April 1949 the maximum installed capacity should be up to 906 KW.i 0 - 4 - and 8 to be running, and this will bring the total power station capacity to 1606 KW. Estimated Future Demands , It is quite clear that the summer of 1949 will again be a bad one, in that many hopeful applicants will still be unconnected. In the summer of 1950 all demands as known today will be covered. It is feared, however, that there will be increases by 1950 in the applications from both types of consumers. I think it is logical to allow 50$ increase on the present known additional demands from large organizations, i.e. 50$ of 742 « 371 KW. Also, I think one should allow for 100$ increase on the private demands, i.e. 168 KW. Total esti mated increase is therefore 539 KW. Thus the estimated demand in 1950 hot weather may be 1385 f 539 a 1924 KW. Installed power at 1606 KW gives a deficit of 318 KW in 1950. The blue curve on the graph is some effort to show the demand, the only points plotted being today’s known demand of 1385 KW and 1950 estimated demand of 1924 KW. Re commendation s . If the above is agreed it will be obvious that new plant should be ordered immediately, in order to have it 5/—in Bahrain as early as possible in 1950 The State Engineer has suggested installing a new set on the seaward side of No, 5. This would get over the crane difficulty, as the set could be erected with the help of a mobile 15 ton crane and the building extended (including crane gantry girders) afterwards. The existing 5 tonscrane would then be sufficient for removal lifts during maintenance and overhaul. As to the size of the set, it is suggested that a 600 KW set as offered early this year, or preferably the super charged set of about 900 KW should be installed. Load factor today is around the region of 50# which is reasonably good. The main reason for this is the complete lack of standby plant as both large sets are doing a steady 18 hours per day. Load factor w^ill be reduced with a 900 KW set installed, although a 24 hour supply will tend to keep it up. (At present the large sets are shut down from 12 midnight to 6 A.M. regardless of demand). The Switchgear will have to be carefully studied as the circuit breakers as they stand are inadequate for the increased output. Even at 1400 KW it has been recommended by the suppliers that sectionalising of the busbars should be carried out in order to reduce the maximum short circuit duty on the circuit breakers. If a 900 KW set is installed the installed power will reachsome 2500 KW and it is quite 6 /evident that ancomplete review of the existing layout of the H.T.^aad alternator panels, outgoing feeder panels and power house transformer feeder panel would be necessary# It would t*' probably be necessary to move the L.T. panel* from iite? existing position. The cooling of the new set is a vital factor, and the new cooling tower is reported by the State Engineer to be up to only half capacity for Nos. 4 and 5 sets and the future six, seven and eight# This needs carefully watching 0 Conclusion # At the time of writing this report I have hot had the pleasure of meeting the new State Engineer, Mr. Braramer. I flew over to Qatar today in the hopes cf seeing him but he had just left by launch for Bahrain. I have every hope however of meeting him before I leave on September 3rd (tomorrow). I would like to suggest, however, that due consideration be given to effecting a proper take over from Group Captain Leigh, as this seems to be very necessary. With the present arrangements Group Captain Leigh will have left Bahrain before Mr. Brammer returns from leave. Group Captain Leigh has planned all the extensions to the Power Station, and I have suggested verbally to the Adviser and to the Political Agent that it would be advisable^ V - 7 / the new plant in order to be certain that the water cooling tower and No. 6 set are running before next hot weather. This plan would have the added advantage of allowing the new State Engineer to concentrate on the distribution system and the maintenance of existing plant in his first few months, the former being in particular need of close examination. / M.C.

May I now know whether the 900 k.w. set has been ordered and whether it is intended to carry out the recommendations in the last two paragraphs of Clear's report under that head? It is a pity that Leigh*s advice given in 1944 to order what then seemed to be adequate generating equipment, and my own given on similar lines in 1945, was not taken, because it was as true then as it is to-day that within very wide limits it is impossible to lose money on installing generating equipment, and I must say that H.H. is financially ill-advised if he does not appreciate this. The bad advertisement for the State, the retarding of its development, and, by no means least, the amount of real hardship caused by the inadequate electricity supply are also factors to be considered.
