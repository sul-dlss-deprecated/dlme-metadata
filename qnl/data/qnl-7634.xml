See folios 164-166 for details on the Italian instructors. The file therefore also contains a limited amount of correspondence related to importing these aircraft, to Kabul via Karachi, and the issue of transit visas to Italian personnel. A considerable amount of correspondence is dedicated to comparing the performance of the Italian Mission and their aircraft with a similar British Mission sent by Hawker Aircraft alongside eight Hinds sold to the Afghan Government.Also contained in the file is discussion surrounding an offer from the Government of India to train an additional batch of students in India in 1938, as a counter to the possibility that the Afghan Government may send a party of students to Italy, and future British policy over supplying aircraft to Afghanistan. There is also some discussion towards the end of the file over the possibility of supplying spare engines and parts from Italian aircraft captured during the course of the Second World War (1939-1945).The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Kabul (William Kerr Fraser-Tytler, later Giles Frederick Squire), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, and officials of the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Afghan Air Force</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Military aircraft</topic></subject><subject><topic>Flight training</topic></subject><subject><topic>Breda Ba.28 (Training plane)</topic></subject><subject><topic>IMAM Ro.37 (Reconnaissance plane)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kabul</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arms sales</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022e#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022e#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022e#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
