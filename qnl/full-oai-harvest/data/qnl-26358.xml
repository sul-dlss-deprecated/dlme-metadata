There is evidence in the letter itself with its request for things to be forwarded
                           toBasra and the fact that it was delivered by cossid (an overland messenger) rather than by boat. The mistake may have been made by the scribe who copied the original letters.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189854.0x00001e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
