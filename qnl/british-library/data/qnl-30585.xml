(Mu'in-ul- Vizareh). Born about 1884. Son of the late Prince Ala-es- Saltaneh, for many years Persian Minister in London. Educated at Westminster School, where he seems to have received rough treatment, which resulted in a strong anti-British bias, at any rate for the next few years. Created C.M.G. in 1905, when he accompanied his father on a special mission to London for the coronation of the late King—&gt;■' l ** 1111 *' ! '' ■ l,, Ur Edward VII. Appointed “ chef de cabinet ” in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1906, his late father being then Minister for Foreign Affairs. He remained as “ chef de cabinet to various Ministers until 1915. Appointed Minister of Public W orbs in January 1918, and continued to direct that Ministry during the Cabinet presided over by Samsam-us-Saltaneh, which was in power from May to August 1918. This Cabinet abrogated the Treaty of Turkmanchai. Ala was hostile to Sir Charles Marling, His , * * Majesty’s Minister from 1915 to 1918, and caused ^ repeated complaints to be made to the foreign Office through his brother, who was then Persian Minister in London.

Was also very active in the organisation of the “ Red Lion and Sun,” and in the Ferdausi Memorial Committee. In 1931 his transfer to the post of Minister in London was mooted, though it did not materialise. On that occasion His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to receive him, on the ground that his attitude in reporting a libel on His Majesty King George V rendered it difficult to suppose that he was then animated by friendly sentiments. Appointed Minister in London, . July 1934. Recalled in the summer of 1936; returned to Tehran in October. Appointed Supervisor of Monopoly Companies, December 1936. Director-General of Commerce in 1937, and given the new appointment ^^f Minister of Commerce in September 1937. Removed from this appointment, April 1938.

Was very active in giving publicity in the United States to the Persian case over the Azerbaijan problem and showed ability in presenting Persia’s case to the Security Council. A hard worker and a staunch patriot; intelligent and well-read; interested in the literature of many countries and quite a good pianist. Has a perfect command of English and speaks good French. In the past he has had a reputation for anti-British sentiments. In 1943 and 1944, however, his relations with the British Legation were good; he seems a good deal more anti-Russian than anti- British, and is doubtless more pro-Persian than either. He is a sensitive Persian Nationalist who realises the failings of his fellow-countrymen. Tends to overrate the virtues of the Shah. 4. A mini, Dr. Ali Fourth son of Mohsen Amini (Amin-ed-Douleh). Born at Tehran in 1903. Educated in Persia and in France. Studied law at Paris. Married one of the daughters of Hassan Vussugh (Vussugh-ed-Douleh).

When the army was reorganised in 1922 he was given the rank of Amir Lashkar (chief of a division) and placed in command of the Western Division with headquarters at Hamadan. Was recalled on account of his shameless robbery and for his treacherous oppression of the Lurs; but, being a favourite of Reza Shah’s, he was appointed to command the amnieh or road guards. Appointed in 1926 to command the North-West Division, while retaining command of the amnieh. Recalled the next year, and appointed to command in Luristan in the spring of 1928.

Suspected by the Russians and disliked by the Shah and Yazdan-Panah for his attempt to insist on the authority of the Ministry of War and to limit the Shah’s intervention in matters of command and administration. Ambitious and always hopeful of becoming Prime Minister. Though his record of bribe-taking and his sketchy education do not make him a satisfactory candidate4 for a head of Government, he has shown himself a man of action and determination in times of crisis, and has been very friendly to us since Reza Shah’s departure. Minister of War in Qavam’s Cabinet, February 1946. Speaks Russian. His accumulated wealth and large properties appear to have satisfied his desires, so that he seems to have got over his youthful inclination towards robbery. 6.

Capable and helpful but exposed himself to criticism for failing to suppress corruption and for introducing nepotism which, it was alleged, flourished in his Ministry on an excessive scale even by Persian standards. 23. Bahar (Malik-ush-Shuard) Born in Meshed, 1882. Son of a well-known poet named Sabouri. A member of the old Democratic party, and edited a paper in Meshed called the No-Bahdr. A member of the third, fourth and fifth Majlises from Meshed, and of the sixth from Tehran. Edited his paper No-Bahdr in Tehran during the7 war of 1914-18, and was pronouncedly pro-German. Nevertheless, he supported Vossugh-ed-Douleh’s Cabinet of 1918-20 during which time he edited the Iran newspaper. Opposed the Government during the term of the fifth Majlis and was an opponent of the change of regime. An attempt was made on his life when the debate on the change of regime took place in the Majlis; but another unfortunate man who resembled him was the victim. Seyyid Hasan Mudarris helped him to get elected to the sixth Majlis. Nothing much was heard of him during Reza Shah’s reign, except that he composed some odes in celebation of the Firdausi centenary in October 1934, and translated into Persian verse a poem by John Drinkwater on that occasion. He has been exiled from Tehran on more than one occasion. In spite of a fondness for opium has been fairly active at Tehran since the change of rdgime in 1941. Up to August 1942 he and Massoud Sabeti actively supported Qavam-es-Saltaneh’s candidature for the post of Prime Minister. After the latter’s fall early in 1943, he obtained newsprint from the Russians with which he kept his paper No-Bahdr going, and published a series of articles apparently critical of but really supporting Qavam. In fact a shifty and over-subtle politician. Acknowledged to be a leading poet, and a practical spaper writer. He himself maintains that he if &amp;bove all anti-Russian but has been associated with the Tudeh for some years. On Committee of Russo-Persian Cultural Relations Society, March 1944. Minister of Education in Qavam’s Cabinet, February 1946, dropped when Cabinet was re-formed in August 1946. 24. Bahrami, Farajullah (Dabir-i-A ‘zam) Born about 1890.

In July 1930 '^appointed Governor of Isfahan, and a year later Governor-General of Fars. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in March 1932. Resigned on the fall of the Hedayat Cabinet in September 1933, and was sent to Meshed as Governor-General in the following January. Superseded as Governor-General of Khorasan in October 1934, for reporting that adequate facilities did not exist at Meshed for the accommodation of the orientalists attending the Ferdausi millenary. Since that time under a cloud. In the summer of 1935 he was suspected of complicity in some plot and was exiled to Malayir. Allowed to i-eturn to Tehran under surveillance, October 1936. After the change of rdgime in 1941 he has been a prominent member of the Adalat party. Minister of the Interior in January 1943, but he very soon became involved in a quarrel with his chief, Qawam- es-Saltaneh, which led to the collapse of the latter’s Cabinet. His criticisms of his chief in that episode did not create a good impression on this Legation; he is evidently self-opinionated and stubborn. Is very alarmed at the Soviet menace to the indepen dence of Persia. Governor-General of Isfahan, 1943-44. A very friendly person, who always appears to do what he can to help British consular officers. Has great aspirations to literary eminence; a great admirer of Hafiz. As Minister he incurred some criticism from his fellow-countrymen for inaccessi bility and lack of hospitality. Speaks very little French. Businesslike and hard-working. 25. Bahrami, Fazlullah Bom about 1897. For some time a colonel in the police, and in charge of the detective force. Acting chief of the Tehran Municipality in 1937. Director of Census and Civil Status, January 1938.

A large individual with some energy; but he seems to have made a good deal of money by dubious land transactions when head of the municipality. Obstinate like all the Bahramy family. Governor-General of Kerman 1944-^15 where he showed great initiative by organising various schemes for improving water supply, raising money for orphanages, &amp;c.—popular there. Offered post of Governor-General, Kermanshah, in August 1945, but refused. Health undermined by malaria. Friendly and co-operative when in Kerman.

He escaped the fate of his fellow khans, and has assisted the Government in their policy of inducing the Bakhtiari tribe to abandon their traditional nomadic habits. Appointed Governor of Bakhtiari early in 1943 and did well, suppressing various upstarts like Abol Ghassem and establishing order in that tribal area, thereby serving British interests well during the war. By the end of 1945 he had, however, become unpopular with the other tribal khans who agitated for his removal. Relieved of his appointment by Qavam- us-Saltanah for leaving Tehran for his properties in the south despite explicit instructions not to do so until he had reached agreement with the other khans. Arrested in September 1946 for complicity in joint Bakhtiari-Qashqai rising. Released Decem ber. A clever man, not above intrigue. Quick tempered, jovial and obstinate. Served Reza Shah well. Very pleasant to meet, but not the sort of man one can trust very far, as he is very much in the hands of his strong-minded wife and also places implicit trust in a worthless agent, Misbah Fatemi. 27. Bayandur, Ghulam Husain, Captain (N akhuda-yekum) Elder brother of Ghulam Ali Bayendor. Was a captain in the army until 1930, when he went to Italy on a course of naval engineering.

Prime Minister November 1944-April 1945. He sought to improve relations with the Russians but his efforts only resulted in the paralysis of the administration of the country. Sent as Governor-General to Tabriz in December 1945 but failed to do anything to check the Azerbaijan independence movement and soon returned to Tehran. Joined Qavam’s Cabinet in February 1946 as Minister of Finance, but was not included when Cabinet was re-formed in August 1946. 29. Bushihri-Dehdasti, Agha Javad (Amir Humayun). Born in Tehran 1898.

Governor-General Tabriz, February 1944. Recalled February 1945. Friendly and pleasant in manner. When in Tabriz invariably took the line of least resistance and was regarded as nothing more than an amiable figurehead. Seemed to be completely amenable to the wishes of the Russians. A voluble talker but carries no weight. 31. Danishian, Ghulam Yahiya Is about 45 years old and is believed to have been born in Russian territory. He speaks Russian well, having been educated in that country, and it is said that he served with the Russian army in the Caucasus for a short time. In 1937 he came to Azerbaijan and settled in Sarab, a village about half way between Tabriz and Ardabil. Some time later he was arrested by the Persian authorities on the charge of being a Soviet agent, and was imprisoned in Tehran. On the Russian occupation of Azerbaijan he obtained his release and went to live in Tabriz. On the formation of the Tudeh Party, Danishian lost no time in joining it, and he was given the task of organising a branch at Sarab, and later another at Mianeh. At the latter village he came into active conflict with the Kherieh Party, which was strongly opposed to the Tudeh, and in the course of a skir mish Danishian was wounded. This provoked the wrath of the Russian commander of troops in k baijan, General Glinski, who, as a reprisal, cast several of the leading personalities in Mianeh into prison in Tabriz. The formation of the Azerbaijan Democrat Party brought Danishian an appointment as Commander of Fida’is in Mianeh and Zenjan. The landlords in Mianeh district decided to leave for Tehran for security, and in their absence, Danishian looted their properties for his personal benefit with the result that he is now one of the wealthiest men in Azerbaijan. Pishavari promoted Danishian to the rank of general on 5th April, 1946, his charge being the Fida’is in Sarab as well as in Mianeh and Zenjan. When the agreement was reached between Azer baijan and the Central Government on 16th June, 1946, Danishian was promoted to be Commander-in- chief of the Fida’is and established himself in Tabriz. He made frequent tours of inspection of Azerbaijan in connexion with his duties and is reputed to have enjoyed the confidence of *%■ Russians to the same extent as Pishavari himseify^ Danishian is reputed to be possessed of exceptional courage and determination, and the Democrat Party, including Pishavari, fear and hate him. Fled to Russia in December 1947 when Persian troops occupied Azerbaijan. 32. DashH, Ali Born about 1887. Educated in the schools of the Holy Places of Iraq. Returned to Persia about 1922 and edited a paper called the Shafaq Surkh. As an editor he became notorious for slanderous abuse and the extortion of money by blackmail, and his abuse of Great Britain and British statesmen was frequently the subject of complaint from His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian Government. He was elected a Deputy to the fifth Majlis in 1924, but he was refused a seat by the Parliamentary Commission, whose duty it was to scrutinise his election proceedings. He was prominent in the abortive Republican movement in 1924, and is said to have received and pocketed large sums from Reza Pahlavi, on whose behalf he worked. After acquiring a share of this world’s goods he appeared to become more human and ceased the abuse and vituperation for which he had become famous. He espoused the cause of Reza Pahlavi against Ahmed Shah, and was elected a Deputy to the sixth Majlis in 1926. He was invited to Moscow in October9 1927 to attend the tenth anniversary of the Soviet regime. From Moscow he went to Berlin and Paris and returned to Persia early in 1928. He was elected a Deputy to the seventh Majlis in 1928 and to the eighth Majlis in 1930. Edited or controlled his paper till about July 1935, receiving subsidies now from the Shah and now from the Soviet Embassy. He is a hot-headed firebrand with no scruples and no principles, and is capable of the basest villainy if it will help him to attain his ends. He speaks no European language, except a little French. In July 1935 he fell into disgrace and was said to have uttered disparaging remarks about Reza Shah’s regime. His paper was suppressed and he himself was allowed to plead sickness and to retire to a Government hospital, where he was made to pay well for his maintenance. At liberty again at the end of 1936. In charge of the Press Bureau of the Ministry of Interior in 1937. Since the fall of Reza has returned to the fore front of Tehran politics. A severe critic of Feroughi and Soheily in 1942, he worked hard for the return of Qawam-es-Saltaneh as Prime Minister. When the latter came back to power and did not make Dashti a Minister, he turned against him and criticised him in many speeches. Dashti is •^Viinly a persuasive orator, who holds the attention of the Majlis as few other persons can do. A prime mover in the Adalat party, he now utters the most enthusiastic praise of democracy on the British model, and evidently hopes that his past will be forgotten by us. As he appears to have much more audacity and forensic ability than most of his rivals, he may well go a good deal further than his present position as a Majlis Deputy. Elected to fourteenth Majlis 1943. Since the oil crisis of 1944 he has opposed the spread of Russian influence in Persia, and has strongly supported the “ resistance ” Cabinets preceding Qavam-us-Saltan eh’s. Was consistently attacked by Tudeh press during this period. Trusted little even by his friends who regard his excessive attachment to women (which he publicly displays) as not in keeping with high office. Arrested May 1946. Released December 1946.

Minister of the Interior of Soheily’s Cabinet, July 1942, and in spite of Majlis opposition maintained his place in the Cabinet. Qawam-es- Saltaneh, in August, made him Minister of Food, in which post he displayed a sort of crazy activity which irritated many and did not achieve much. Having fallen out with the American adviser Sheridan, he left the Ministry of Food on the fall of the Qawam Cabinet in February 1943. Elected a Deputy for Zabul in the fourteenth Majlis, November 1943. Appointed Governor-General of Fars, December 1945, but was recalled in February 1946. 36. Farzaneh, Hassan Born about 1892.

Intelligent, entirely unscrupulous, and very ambitious; speaks good English and has studied English and English literature, and can remember many extracts. At present (1944) it suits him to appear pro-British; he is certainly anti-Russian. Has many enemies, both Persian and British, but is a man who can, when he wishes, make himself very useful. Was largely responsible for organising the anti-Tudeh Workers’ Union in Isfahan. Before Qavam came into power in 1946, he pretended to be passionately opposed to him (a ruse enacted to please the British). In fact he almost certainly supported him as was shown by an article appearing in his brother’s paper Bakhtar on the day that Qavam was elected.

Elected to the fourteenth Majlis for Isfahan 1943, being supported by the Tudeh party, of which he is a member, though he disclaims being a Communist and is not looked upon favourably by the Tudeh party in Tehran owing to his moderate views. He is thought not to have had any direct relations with the authorities concerning the elections. He is7 c ^ course, disliked by most of the capitalists of Isfahan, though some of them accept him as a fairly single- minded man. His main political following is among the factory workers and guilds and small bazaar men, who are naturally opposed to domination by the few rich families of Isfahan. Lost his political following among the factory workers of Isfahan during 1944—45 when the Isfahan workers’ union broke away from the Tudeh. On coming to Tehran as a Deputy he immediately fell under Soviet influence. In April 1946 succeeded in re-establishing Tudeh influence in the Isfahan factories. 42. Firuz, Muhammad Hussein Born about 1895. The fourth son of the late Farman Farma. Educated at the military college at Petrograd. Entered the Persian army during the 1914—18 war, and was regarded as one of Hie promising young officers of the army. Appoil^d Chief of Staff of the Southern Division in 192 ^ and did very good work in organising the troops in Fars and enforcing discipline and efficiency. Sent to Delhi as representative of the Persian army at the Indian army manoeuvres early in 1925. Fell under suspicion for some reason about 1929 and resigned his commission. His Qajar origin was no doubt the cause of his collapse. Very attached to his brother Firuz (Nusrat-ed-Douleh) but not on good terms with his father. Married a Miss Namazi, who was educated in Hong Kong and speaks English perfectly. Returned to Persia late in 1941, and was sent to Fars as G.O.C. and Governor-General in March 1942. Superseded in both appointments by Marshal Shahbakhti a year later. He had succeeded in keeping a rather precarious order in Fars, but never succeeded in repressing Nasir Qashqai’s rebellious movement. Head of the air force, 1943. Again appointed Governor-General of Fars in early summer of 1944 but did not get on with the influential Qavam-ul-Mulk or the Qashqai Khans. His enemies accused him of weakness and of truckling too much to the Tudeh, but His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, on the contrary, considered that his refusal to take unnecessarily repressive measures against the Tudeh was more sound. Appointed Minister of War in Sa'id’s reconstituted Cabinet in August 1944 but refused the appointment. Minister ofCommunications in Hakimi’s Cabinet November 1945. Resigned a month later. Returned to the same Ministry in Qavam’s Cabinet in February 1946, but was left out when Qavam re-formed his Cabinet in October 1946. Appointed Inspector- General, Persian Air Force, March 1947. Speaks very good French and some English; intelligent and enlightened. A brilliant talker, he seems capable of proving with most convincing reasons that he is always right—but one feels sometimes that he is too convincing. 43. Firuz, Muhammad Vall Mirza (Far- man farmaiyan) Third son of the late Farman Farma. Born about 1893. Educated at Beirut and Paris. Sent to Tabriz as head of the Finance Department, 1915. Said to have taken many bribes while in that appointment. Is very thrifty and has large properties both in Tehran and Tabriz. Elected a Deputy to the fourth, fifth and sixth Majlises for Tabriz. On the fall of his brother, Nusrat-ed- Douleh, in 1931, he retired from public life and was seldom seen. Has been in Europe a good deal. Elected to the thirteenth Majlis for Sarah in September 1941, and again to the fourteenth in November 1943. His appearance being that of an underfed bird of prey, seems to keep him in the ^^ikground, but he has a good deal of his father’s intelligence. Became Minister of Labour and Propaganda in October 1946 but resigned in December to stand as a candidate for the fifteenth Majlis. Went to Switzerland February 1947. 44. Firuz, Muzaffar Born about 1910, grandson of Farman Farma, brother of Muhammad Shah, and accordingly uses the title of Prince in social life. Educated at Harrow and Cambridge. Speaks excellent English and fair French : is bitterly hostile to the Pahlavi dynasty and his sole raison d’etre is to avenge the murder of his father by Riza Shah. His hostility has recently been sharpened by the fact that his wife’s relation, Ismit-ul-Muluk, one of the wives of Reza Shah, was recently evicted from the palace on a charge of improper behaviour. At one time employed in Persian Legation in Washington, whence, it is believed, he was removed at the request of the U n ited States Government for abuse of diplomatic privileges. r*' It was Firuz who went to Palestine and brought from there Zayyid Zia’s first manifesto. He remained an ardent supporter of Sayyid Zia until May 1945 when he broke with him. He says that the breach was caused by Sayyid Zia’s becoming more and more dictatorial, but Sayyid Zia’s version was that they had to part because Firuz would not abandon his newspaper campaign, in the newspaper Ra’d-i-lmrvz which he owns and edits, against the Shah, and Sayyid Zia‘felt that it was impossible to fight the Russians and the Shah at the same time. Towards the end of 1945 he became one of the chief supporters of Qavam-ul-Saltaneh. As a reward for this, Qavam, when he became Prime Minister in February 1946, appointed Firuz Political Under secretary, an office apparently created for the pur pose, and Director of Propaganda. He became Minister of Labour and Propaganda in August 1946, but was dropped when Qavam-ul-Saltaneh re formed his Cabinet in October 1946 and sent to Moscow as ambassador. He has a bent 'for propa ganda and sensational journalism and has succeeded in making himself extremely unpopular even with his colleagues. His madness is enhanced by a titanic conceit but not by conspicuous courage. Rash, unbalanced, dishonest, untruthful and malicious, w'ould probably sacrifice anything to bring about the downfall of the Shah. 45. Furdhar, A hhas Bom about 1895. Though his junior in age, is an uncle of Abul-Qasim Ferouhar. Member of the Protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1934, and acted as head of that depart ment in 1935 and part of 1936.

Married in 1939 a daughter of Muhammad Ali Muqaddam. Polite, friendly and well-meaning, but the head of the Protocol Depart ment under Reza Shah had a thankless task. Nevertheless, M. Ferouhar, unlike his colleagues at the Court, survived the ordeal of the Crown Prince’s wedding celebrations. Sent to Beirut with the vague title of “ Del4gu4 ” at the end of 1942. Recalled temporarily in 1943 to give explanations about the conduct of Muzaffar Firuz. Chargd d’Affaires to Greek Court in Cairo, June 1944. Minister to Yugoslavia April 1946.

Head of the Mortgage Bank 1939. Realised one of his ambitions when he became president of the National Bank of Iran (Banque Mellie) in September 1942. In that post he has worked hard and been of great service to us in many ways. He seems to be one of the few Persian financiers with intelligence, ability and energy. On the other hand he is hasty, hot-tempered and easily upset, and his persistence in an unwise legal attack on the Imperial Bank of Iran (a suit which he eventually lost) seems to show that he bears that institution a grudge. Pro-British and anti-Russian to such an extent that he is also regarded as a British agent by his numerous political rivals. Sayyid Zia and his supporters, however, were bitterly opposed to him on the Millspaugh issue. His attitude towards the latter was consistently obstructive.

Intelligent and fairly well educated, he is enthusiastic about sport, which he has done much to encourage in the Persian army; plays polo and tennis moderately well.

Minister of War, March 1942, and employed in the autumn at court as a kind of aide-de-camp in general to the Shah.

Kazemi is socially agreeable and friendly, and speaks English and some French. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he was not a success.

Then Minister of Finance in Qawam- es-Saltaneh’s Cabinet of August 1942, but resigned before its fall in circumstances which did him little credit.

Reza Shah made him resign in June 1940, and his conduct of the various negotiations which had taken place while he was Prime Minister gave rise to a strong suspicion that he was favouring the Germans. In fact, in the speech which he made to journalists and Majlis Deputies shortly after Matin-Daftary’s dismissal, Reza Shah accused him of not reporting fully to the Shah. However, it is difficult to believe this; the Shah being an absolute autocrat, receiving detailed reports from numerous sources, it seems unlikely that any Prime Minister would risk the Royal wrath by suppressing anything. He himself says it was the Shah who ordered him to favour the Germans. Retired into seclusion in June 1940 until two years later. In 1943 was evidently hoping to re-enter the political arena. Arrested as a suspect June 1943, but soon released. Minister without Portfolio in Qavam’s Cabinet, February 1946. ^ Stood unsuccessfully as candidate for Tehran in ''Sections for fifteenth Majlis.

Pahlavi, Shah Muhammad Riza The eldest son of Riza Shah by the daughter of Teymour Khan; this lady was the ex-Shah’s chief consort and was known as the “ Malikeh.” Born on 26th October, 1919, and proclaimed Yali- ahd, or heir-apparent on 1st January, 192fi Educated in Tehran under tutors at first, and tl^^ in Switzerland at La Rosey, under the direction Dr. Muadab Nafisi.

Betrothed in June 1938 and married Princess Fauzieh, sister of King Farouk of Egypt, at Cairo on 15th March, 1939. The marriage was preceded by a very pompous journey through Iraq, Syria and Egypt. The principal wedding festivities took place in Tehran in April, on the couple’s arrival,.and were attended by delegations from many countries, including the Earl of Athlone and Her Royal High ness Princess Alice, the Duke of Spoleto and General Weygand. The only offspring so far is one daughter, Shahnaz, born in 1940. Queen Fauzieh has been living in Egypt since 1943 and seems un likely to return to Persia. Muhammad Reza succeeded to the throne, on the abdication of his father, in September 1941. He is determined to interpret literally the provision of the Constitution which says that the Shah is the com mander of the armed forces, and has hitherto . delegated little if any responsibility in army matters to the Minister for War. As yet he has no male heir and he has not yet declared any of hi* brothers to be “ Vali-ahd ” or next in succession to the throne. His attitude in the riots of 8th December, 1942, and in the reshuffle of Suhaili’s Cabinet in Decem ber 1943 showed him to be on the one hand prone tolisten to the advice of worthless subordinates, and on the other hand determined to emulate his father and (in the reported words of Stalin to him at the Tehran Conference in November—December 1943) “be a King in fact as well as in name.’’ His admiration for his father, and the influence of his bitterly anti-British mother, must both tend to make him believe the theory which his mother instils into him, that the British expelled Iteza Shah, whereas in actual fact the latter abdicated at the advance of Bussian troops on Tehran. He has become a good amateur pilot and is a skilled horseman. At heart he distrusts Qavam-us-Saltaneh and has had a number of serious differences with him since he became Prime Minister in 1946. In the latter part of 1946 and early months of 1947 the Shah’s popularity steadily increased. He has intelligence, courage and a capacity for intrigue. In public utterances and official inter views he is plausible but he has no discrimination in the choice of his advisers and tends to take the advice of the last person he sees. 110.

Has not come back to politics since the fall of Reza Shah, though he is often mentioned in terms of extravagant praise as the most honest man, if not the only honest man, in Persia.

Governor of Kermanshah in 1897; of Zinjan in 1899 and 1900, and of Arabistan from 1901 to 1904, where he married the daughter of a local chief. Fled from Tehran to Luristan in April 1904, but was brought back and appointed Governor of Kurdistan in 1905. Collected tribesmen from Luristan and rebelled against Muhammad Ali Shah in . June 1907. A fight occurred in that month between his followers and the Shah’s troops outside Nihavend. He was defeated and took refuge at the British consulate at Kermanshah, but was handed over to the Persian authorities under a promise of personal safety. Thereafter he was placed under surveillance and was considered mentally deranged. Expelled to Europe after coup d’Etat of 1908. Entered Persia again in May 1911 from the direction of Bagdad. In the following July he seized the capital of Kurdistan and advanced on Kermanshah. Having arrived there he collected a large force of Lurs, including the Kalhur tribe, and marched on Tehran via Sultanabad. Bakhtiaris and Armenian irregulars were sent against him and inflicted a severe defeat on him near Nubaran in September 1911. He then retreated to Luristan and was again defeated in November 1911. Having been at large in Kermanshah and Kurdistan for some time, he suddenly appeared near Tehran and threatened, but did not actually attack, the capital. He then betook himself to Asterabad whence, with the assistance of Russian influence, he carried on negotiations with the Persian Government to be appointed Governor of Gilan. After some further adventures he was persuaded to leave Persia with a pension from the Persian Government and resided in Switzerland till 1918. In that year he formed a project to enter Persia through Transcaspia and raise a revolt in the Asterabad district. He was caught by a British detachment in about December 1918 before crossing the Persian frontier, and was sent via Kazvin to Bagdad where he was interned till the following autumn, when he was again allowed to return to Switzerland. He slipped over the Iraq-Persian frontier in June 1926 somehow avoiding the Iraq police authorities. His presence caused considerable embarrassment to the new Pahlavi Government who realised that Salar, however mad, was a possible rallying point for the forces of reaction. However, after fruitless negotiations with various Kurdish chiefs, during which he contracted marriage with the daughters of some of them, he left Persia in the autumn of 1926. The Persian Government from that date paid him a subsidy of 1,500 rials per month from secret funds up to September 1933. Salar was persuaded to settle down at Haifa after having given an ambiguous promise to behave himself. On the cessation of his subsidy in 193a he was informed by British authorities that he was free to do what he liked.

Minister of Justice in Qawam-es-Saltaneh’s Cabinet of August 1942; resigned in the following January without having accomplished anything valuable. An honest politician, but much too old to learn anything new or useful. Lives in Tehran; used frequently to visit Paris. A queer and eccentric man, with a reputation for honesty. 118.

After the fall of Reza Shah was not employed in Government service until he became secretary to Dr. Millspaugh at the end of 1942; and in May 1943 was employed at Court, his brother-in-law, Ala, being Minister of Court. Charming but ineffective; his failure to fulfil his early promise has been a disappointment, but a believer in Anglo-Persian co-operation. An idealist with a certain intelligence and a reputation for honesty. Speaks perfect English and French. 119. Nizam-Qaraguzlu, Husain Quli (Amir Nizam). Born in 1883, the eldest son of the late Amir Nizam. A member of the Qaragozlu family of Hamadan and a nephew of the late Regent, Nasir- ul-Mulk. Educated in England and Austria Passed through the Military Academy at Vienna, and served with a commission in an Austrian25 33860 infantry regiment for three years. Inherited large estates from his father in the district of Hamadan, but owing to his absence in Europe from 1921 to 1929 these estates have been allowed to deteriorate. Was appointed Governor of Kermanshah by Vossuq in 1919, where he was very popular on account of his honesty and integrity. Being a rich man he was imprisoned at the time of the coup d’Etat in 1921, and made to pay 20,000 tomans as the price of his release. He was so disgusted at this unmerited treatment that he left Persia and vowed never to return. During his stay in Europe he lost heavily at Monte Carlo and Deauville. Teymourtache met him in Europe in 1928, and persuaded him to return to Persia, which he did in 1929. Appointed Grand Master of Ceremonies at the Court in March 1929.

Qashqai, Muhammad Nasir Born 1904. The eldest son of the late Isma’il Qashqai (Saulat-ud-Dauleh). Elected to the eighth Majlis as a- member of the Qashqai. Ilkhani and the most influential chieftain of his tribe for a short time during 1930. Deprived of parliamentary uiamunity and arrested for conspiracy in 1932. Fled _ l7\n Tehran during the general disorder in Septem- •taer 1941 and recovered his old position in Fars where he is now the accepted but not entirely undisputed leader of the Qashqai. Is the only one of the four brothers who is married. Does not smoke or drink and is a model family man. Tall, broadly built, staring eyes, slight smallpox marks on face, of com manding presence. A fast talker and a good raconteur. Fond of town society and, when living in civilised surroundings, is very reasonable and amenable. When living with the tribes he seems to lose his balance (where matters outside the parochial affairs of the tribes are concerned) and to be easily misled. This instability probably results from his varied earlier experiences including imprisonment in Tehran with his father who died in captivity. Until the summer of 1945, when he eventually screwed up courage to come to Tehran, he seems to have been generally in fear of re-imprisonment. His anxiety to consolidate his position leads him, at the prompting of others, to see in himself a future Governor-General of Fars. Prime Minister and even Shah of Persia. Speaks a little English and understands much. He had two Germans with him in 1943 and made a landing ground, intended for German aeroplanes, near Farrashband. He rebelled in 1943 and was attacked by troops under Marshal Shahbakht but the operations were very half-hearted and soon fizzled out. In April 1944 he handed over the Ger mans who had taken refuge with him and undertook to co-operate with the Allies. Was a leader of a tribal revolt in Fars in summer of 1946 in which his brothers also took part. After some fighting the Qashqais came to an understanding with the Government and peace was restored. One of his brothers, Muhammad Hussain, was a Deputy in the fourteenth Majlis, for Abadeh. Studied in England but left because of chronic asthma and studied economics at Berlin University. Voluble speaker and very excitable, unreliable and not to be trusted. Khusru, another brother, is the youngest son of Saulat-ud-Dauleh and was born in 1921. The reprobate of the family. Great personal bravery and recklessness. Inherits his father's cruelty and sadism : credited with a number of wanton killings. Was appointed Governor of Firuzabad in November 1943 but is never at his post, preferring to make frequent trips to Tehran. Made large sums of money by selling monopoly goods destined for the tribes at an enormous profit in the open market. Has per sonal charm, considerable powers of persuasion and a boundless capacity for making mischief. Is generally described as a “ child ” which is intended by some in excuse of his excesses and by others to mean that it is time he grew up. The fourth brother, Malik Mansur, was born in 1907 and studied at Reading University. Tall and lithe, hawk-like appearance, very attractive per sonality, talks much but slowly and tends to repeat himself. Speaks good English, German and a little French, Turkish and Turki. Reported to be loved by the tribespeople where Nasir is feared. Devoted to tribal pursuits of hunting and riding. Says that he will do his utmost to oppose any Government attempt at interference with the tribe and that he is prepared to fight the army. 121. Qawam, Ibrahim (Qawam-ul-Miilk) Bom 1888. The son of Murza Habibullah Khan Qawam-ul-Mulk, who was killed accidentally in May 1916. During the war of 1914-18 was very friendly to us, and carried on his father’s traditional policy of opposition to the powerful Qashqai group of tribes headed by the late Ismail Khan Soulat-ud-Douleh. Having inherited vast properties in Fars from his father, as well as the titular headship of the “ Arab ” tribes of that province, he wielded immense authority in the south of Persia at the time of the coup d’Etat of 1921. Reza Khan (late Reza Shah) when Minister for War met the Qawam at Isfahan in August 1923 and expressed a wish that he should reside at Tehran; he therefore became elected to the Majlis as member for the Khamseh (Arab) tribes and thereafter has resided a good deal in Tehran. Always on terms of close friendship with His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, the Qawam engaged in 1926 a British agricultural expert to develop his vast estates; the experiment proved a failure through local opposition and the Qawam’s stinginess; the British expert left in 1928. In 1929 fled to Europe, doubtless having foreseen the Qashqai revolts of that year. Visited London 1929. Returned to Tehran the following year, having put his two boys to school at Beirut. His vast properties were left in the hands of his servants, who remitted him a monthly subvention. In 1929 various questions of validity of title to property were raised by the Ministry of Finance; and in 1931 the whole question was settled by the exchange of lands. The Qawam was given crown lands in Nishapur, in the neighbourhood of Tehran, and elsewhere in the centre of Persia, in exchange for his Fars properties. It is believed that he did wellout of these transactions, and that he is one of the wealthiest landowners of Persia at present. In the ninth Majlis of 1933 he was a Deputy for Baluchistan. He had also accompanied Keza Shah on several of his journeys, and was generally supposed to enjoy His Majesty’s full confidence. In November 1933, however, on the arrest of the Minister of War, Sardar Asad, while in attendance on the Shah at the Turcoman races, the Qawam seems to have become the object of suspicion, and he was placed under arrest with Asad. He is an attractive personality to meet. Very pro-British in sentiment, he sent his two sons (Ali Muhammad Qawam and Muhammad Reza Qawam) to England to be educated. Until his arrest he appeared to have settled down permanently as a peaceful courtier at Tehran. Quiet in voice and retiring in manner, he is yet capable of driving a very hard bargain with his own countrymen. He does not appear to have much ambition. Though his name is still a household word at Shiraz, he cannot be considered a tribal leader in the sense that the Qashqai chiefs are; he is best considered as a Persian noble whose family had for some time held suzerainty over a group of tribes and who attained great wealth and influence in Ears, partly through backing the right side in the 1914 war. His son, Ali Muhammad, married Princess Ashraf Pahlavi in March 1937 but the' marriage was dis solved. He subsequently married a girl of the Sheibani family, daughter of Muhasib-ul-Mamalik. He had previously been an undergraduate at Bristol where he did badly. The other son, Reza, married a daughter of General Muqaddam : one daughter is married to Asadullah Alam son of the late Shaukat- ul-Mulk and the other to Dr. Abul Qasim Nafisi. Played his part in the “events of 1941’’j he and his family at one time “ took bast ’’ in the British Legation at Gulhek; and when Reza Shah abdicated and went to Isfahan it was Qawam who was sent by the Government to obtain Reza’s signature to documents handing over his properties and private fortune to the State and to his son respectively. Visited India 1941-42 and bought a house at Bangalore. Sent back to Shiraz to help Marshal Shahbakhti with his attack on the Qashqais in June 1943. His elder son, Ali Muhammad, went to Washington as Assistant Military Attach^ at the end of 1941. Appointed Governor-General of Ears September 1943, but could not agree with any of the military chiefs about tribal policy, and returned to Tehran November 1943. He still enjoys considerable influence in Ears but resides generally in Tehran. The general tendency among his own family, whose obedience but not consciences he commands, is to regard him with the utmost respect as the survival of a day that is gone. He himself does not seem to be conscious of, or will not admit, this passage of time. His elder son, Ali Muhammad, has now returned from Washington. 122. Qavam, Ahmad (Qawam-us-Saltanah) A brother of Hassan Vossuq, than whom he is younger by a few years. Began his career in the Ministry of Finance.

Banished to Europe in October 1923, being accused of having plotted against the life of Reza Khan (Reza Shah). Was allowed to return to Tehran at the end of 1928 and arrived in March 1929, when he went to reside quietly on his property at Lahijan near Resht. Came back to live in Tehran after the fall of Reza Shah. Prime Minister, August 1942, after the fall of Soheily. Worked hard, but gradually surrounded himself with his own relations and friends. Tried hard to gain control of the Ministry of War, but failed to counteract the young Shah’s enthusiasm for the control of the army. The Shah’s opposition to him was shown in the disturbances of the 8th December 1942, in which Qavam did extremely well and undoubtedly performed a great public service in re-establishing governmental authority. Thereafter, however, he became more and more involved in petty intrigues and favouritism, and had to resign in February 1943; since when he has been more or less openly accused of being the real instigator of the riots of December 1942. Believed to have been in touch with the Japanese Legation early in 1942, and to have received, when Prime Minister in 1942, messages from persons whom he knew r to be German agents, without informing us. This was brought to the notice of Shah in January 1944. Became Prime Minister in February 1946 with additional offices of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior.

In June 1927 he fell from favour and confined himself to journalism, and accompanied the Shah on his journey to Khuzistan in October 1928 as press representative. Rahnema is an ambitious man, with plenty of “ push.” His great ambition has always been to obtain a Government post, which he hoped would culminate in a ministerial appointment.

Controlled the Kermanshah area pretty thoroughly, ignoring completely the civil governor, till he was transferred to Fars to quell the Qashqais under Naser Qashqai in February 1943. He was not very successful in that campaign and after the defeat of the garrison at Semirum in July 1943 came to Tehran to report. In his old age he seems to have become more arrogant and unapproachable. Sus pected of taking large bribes when at Kermanshah. An almost entirely uneducated survival from the Cossack Brigade, resembling in appearance and manners the more famous product of that corps, Reza Shah. Placed on retired list October 1943. Recalled to active list 1947. 143. Shaibani, General Habibullah Born about 1885, the son of Nazm-ed-Dowleh, who came of a middle-class family of Kashan. In 1906 Shaibani went to Saint-Cyr, where he graduated in 1910 and joined a French regiment. Returned to Persia in 1913, and was commissioned into the Swedish officered gendarmerie as a captain. He was highly regarded by the Swedish officers, and was promoted major in 1914.

He entered the French Staff College and graduated with distinction in 1925.

Promoted general of division in June 1929, he was sent to command the army*, in F ars to deal with the rebellion in that province. He was suc cessful in restoring order, as the Qashgai, although in a fighting mood, were short of munitions. In 1930 he commanded the operations in the Mama- senni district and against the Kuhgelus, and by October he had succeeded in reducing the Kuhgelus, only one of the khans still refusing to make his submission to the Government. Tried by a military court-martial in the autumn of 1931, on a charge of military inefficiency in his 1930 operations against the Mamasenni and the Boir Ahmedi tribes, resulting in some 500 Persian casualties. Sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and deprivation of all his ranks and dignities. He was released after a few months in prison, and is said to have gone abroad during 1935. Said to be either in Berlin or in Switzerland 1942. Shaibani is a man of independent views, and Is somewhat rigid and narrow-minded. He is a str' “ ^riA A disciplinarian, and does not play to the gallery, military ideas are conservative and sound, and he is perhaps the only French-trained officer who has not been led away from the realisation of realities. He regards Russia as the enemy of Persia; of the motives underlying British policy he has a fair understanding, and he thinks that Britain can and should help Persia in her own interests, but he believes that Britain will always sacrifice Persia if it should be in her interest to do so. He is intensely patriotic, and will stoutly oppose what* ever he considers to be derogatory to Persian sovereignty or detrimental to Persian independence. At the same time he views with disfavour Persia’s hasty efforts to play the role of a civilised nation. He is remarkably honest, direct in speech, and prompt in action. He has little sympathy with Persian officialdom. His nickname in the army is “ Feranghi,” not by reason of any imitation of Europeans, but rather because of the un-Persian nature of his character. ^ He speaks French fluently. 144.

His Cabinet fell in July 1942, partly owing to lack of support from the Court and the army. Again Prime Minister on the fall of Qawam-es-Saltaneh in February 1943, once more unexpectedly; this time it was largely because Mu’tamin-ul-Mulk could not stand and the Majlis did not want the Shah’s candidate, Saed.

A very reasonable, matter-of-fact person, with a businesslike manner. Hard working, and a good deal more approachable than some of his colleagues. In his contacts with this Legation he has always given the impression of his willingness to help and to arrive at a reasonable settlement.

Elected President of the fourteenth Majlis. An opium addict for thirty years, he frequently found it difficult to keep awake when he was pre siding over the Majlis. Moreover, sessions could not last till after 1-30 p.m. because the time for his pipe had come. An incorrigible intriguer he stands close to the Shah to whom he has always offered bad advice, favouring a conciliatory policy towards Soviet aggression. His “ liberal ” ideas are not to be taken seriously. He and his friends pride them selves on their patriotism and the pursuit of the middle way between Britain and the U.S.S.R. For reasons unknown he is generally regarded as a “ national ” figure Would like to be Prime Minister. Unsuccessful candidate for Tehran in elections for fifteenth Majlis. 154.

In 1942, being by that time the owner of a very prosperous farm near Chazza in Palestine, which he had developed himself, he began to think of returning to his native country, and Muzaffar Firuz began with great energy and indiscretion to run a newspaper campaign in his favour in Tehran. He published a letter from the Seyyid in which the Russians were praised in fulsome language. His name came forward a good deal in the Tehran presa during 1943, and quite a number of Deputies in thirteenth Majlis seem to have favoured his retunf^ The Russians and the Shah, however, were stead fastly opposed to his return, the former because they mistrusted Firuz’s unfortunate letter, and the latter through fear that the Seyyid might become a dictator. However, he returned to Tehran in September 1943 and was elected to the fourteenth Majlis from Yezd, his native place. Caused annoy ance by insisting on wearing a woollen hat of Caucasian style, and alienated some of his friends by an appearance of stubbornness and obstinacy. Founded a political party which in the summer of 1945 was officially launched under the name of § “ Iradeh-i-Milli ” or National Will. His followers claimed that the party numbered about 9,000 in Tehran, at the end of 1945. Is the particular bug bear of the Tudeh and the Russians, who never tire of vilifying him as the arch-enemy of his country and the principal tool in Persia of imperialists, reactionaries, &amp;c. During the near-panic whid^y prevailed in Tehran in November-December 19&lt; as a result of the approach of the Azerbaijan ^ Democrats towards Qazvin many leading politicians and Deputies began seriously to consider that Seyyid Zia should be exiled from Persia as a sop to the Russians. Arrested by Qavam-us-Saltanah on 19th March, 1946. Released to house det-ention in March 1947 on account of ill-health. It is no exaggeration to say that Seyyid Zia rallied the anti-Tudeh forces in Persia and thus made it possible to resist intensive Soviet pressure when it came. Alone among Persians he has never allowed personal or even party interest to interfere with his policy. By his uncompromising resistance to Russian encroachments he became the symbol of Persia’s will to resist. Though suspicious of Sa’id when he first came to power, he nevertheless sup ported him wholeheartedly when he proved that he was determined to resist Soviet demands. Simi larly, he strongly supported Hakimi’s foreign policy, - although his party suffered severely at his hands. Again, when Qavam-us-Saltaneh did not surrender to the Soviets he gave him his support, although &gt; the latter has a personal feud with him since he was one of those imprisoned by him in 1921. A man of outstanding singleness of purpose and courage. Personally attractive, religious without being fanatical or obscurantist, he is at the same time short-tempered and impatient of criticism. These defects, however, were very much less notice able during the last few months of the fourteenthMajlis. He is both honest and energetic—a very rare combination in Persia. In matters non-political he tends to have very wild ideas which he defends with unreasonable obstinacy. The comparative lack of success of his party was due first to furious Soviet opposition, secondly, to his having been out of contact with the country for twenty-three years, and thirdly to the impossibility of reconciling his progressive ideas with the con servatism of many of his followers on whose financial aid he was dependent Speaks French and English. Has something of the mystic in him 155. Tadayun, Sayyid Muhammad Born about 1884, a native of Birjand in East Persia; educated in Tehran, where he graduated and became a schoolmaster. After the split up of the original Democrat party in 1912, Tadayun became the leader of one of the more important Democrat factions. He was elected a Deputy from Tehran to the fourth term of the Majlis, and from Birjand to the fifth and sixth terms. Was elected President of the Majlis in the second half of the fifth term, and again at the beginning of the sixth term. In February 1927 he was appointed Minister of Edu cation, but in December he resigned that appoint ment owing to disagreement with his colleagues in /'e Cabinet, but he resumed office nine days later ■'*c the personal request of the Shah. On the 7th January, 1928, the Shah ordered him to resign, and his fall was said to be due to the personal animosity towards him of Teymourtache. In June 1930 he was appointed Governor of Kerman. He was recalled from Kerman in March 1931, and he appears to believe that one reason for his recall was that he was too friendly with Lieutenant- Colonel Noel, then British Consul. Returned to politics on the fall of Reza Shah; was Minister of Education in Feroughi’s Cabinet of 1941-42, and spoke eloquently in favour of the Tripartite Treaty of 1942. Minister of Food after Farrukh in 1942; resigned in July 1943. Minister of the Interior, September 1943, and did well in running the elections. But was not included in the reshuffled Cabinet of December 1943. The Russians, who for some reason are against him, seem to have secured his exclusion. ^&gt;56. Tahiri, Dr. Hadi Born at Yezd about 1888. Son of a mulla. Land- owner and proprietor of various concerns at Yezd. A great rival of the Nawwab family of Yezd. Elected to the Majlis on various occasions, and has served as president of the Financial Commission of the Majlis. In the thirteenth Majlis was one of the vice-presidents and was considered one of the leading members of the Majlis. Served on the Committee of the Anglo-Iranian Relief Fund, 1943, and was helpful in providing local knowledge. Was largely responsible for the success of Seyyid Zia-ed- Din in the Yezd elections of 1943, thereby incurring the dislike and distrust of the Shah. Very friendly to us. Accused of various peculations at Yezd, but nothing has been proved, and he is considered one of the most solid and reliable Deputies. In the fourteenth Majlis he was, with Sayyid Kazim Jalili Yazdi, the most influential Deputy. Bitterly anti-Soviet he worked hard to maintain the Majlis majority against Soviet pressure. Though very slow in speech and manner he is extremely astute and had a profound knowledge of his Majlis colleagues and particularly of their weak points. Though patriotic he would not allow his patriotism to interfere unduly with his personal interests in Yezd. He has a congenital aversion to the obvious course and delights to achieve his objectives by devious means through the agency of others. It would be idle to pretend that he has progressive ideas. Although ostensibly on excellent terms with Sayyid Kazim Jalili, he is secretly jealous of him, a sentiment that is reciprocated. Arrested November 1946 for political activities against Qavam-us-Saltaneh. Released February 1947. 157. Taqizadeh, Hasan Born in Tabriz about 1880, the son of a small preacher. He was educated in his native town, and used to haunt the booksellers’ shops, where he showed great eagerness to acquire knowledge. In his early youth he was an ardent Nationalist, and was connected with the Nationalist movement in Persia from the beginning. He was elected to the first term of the Majlis and was one of its most prominent members. Mohammad Ali Shah hated and feared him, and, when the Shah made a coup d’fitat in 1908 against the Majlis, Taqizadeh took refuge in His Majesty’s Legation. The demand made by the Shah that he should be given up was refused, and Taqizadeh was eventually amnestied, on the condition that he went to Europe. He visited London and Cambridge, but returned to Tabriz at the end of 1908. He was elected to the second term of the Majlis in 1909, and, after the capture of Tehran by the Nationalist forces and the abdication of Muhammad Ali Shah in July 1909, Taqizadeh became a prominent member of the Nationalist Committee, which was set up to decide on the Government of the country. Went to Europe in 1910. He was elected in his absence to the third and fourth terms of the Majlis, but did not take his seat. He stayed in Europe and America during the whole period from 1914 to 1923, and was for years in Berlin, where he edited a paper called Kaveh. For publishing certain articles of an anti- Islamic nature he was excommunicated by the Mujtehids. He negotiated the Perso-Soviet Com mercial Treaty in Moscow in February 1921, and finally returned to Persia in 1924. He was elected to the fifth term of the Majlis 192L-26, and to the sixth term in 1926. He visited America again in 1926 as Persian delegate to the Philadelphia Exhi bition. Appointed Governor-General of Khorasan in January 1929; he was recalled in May and appointed Persian Minister in London, where he remained until April 1930, when he returned to Persia and became Minister of Roads and Communi cations. In August 1930 he was appointed Minister of Finance in addition. Taqizadeh fell from grace in September 1933, for reasons which are obscure. The Shah is said to have suspected him of intrigue with Majlis members in connexion with the purchase of gold. He was, however, soon re-employed as Minister in Paris. Recalled from Paris in August 1934, but obtained prolonged leave of absence and did not return to Persia. Appointed Iranian representative at the Congress of Orientalists at Rome in September 1935. He is married to a German and talks German fluently. He speaks English and French less well. Appointed Minister in London by Feroughi 1941, and has been suggested as Prime Minister on more than one occasion since then, but he has always preferred to stay in London. Became ambassador in 1944. Headed Persian Delegation to the U.N.O. in London in January 1946 and ably presented the Persian case when the Security Council considered the Perso-Russian dispute about Azerbaijan. Appointed to act as Persian representative in winding up the League of Nations in Geneva, March 1946. Elected Deputy for Tabriz in fifteenth Majlis and decided to return to Persia.■■■■■■■ 34 158.

A man of great ability and character. He became unpopular over the Anglo-Persian Convention, but, after a most able arid convincing defence of his acts as Prime Minister during the period 1918-20 before the Majlis, he regained a large measure of popu larity. Went to Europe for a serious operation 1940; survived it, unable to return to Persia; he was appointed ambassador to Turkey by his brother, Qawam-es-Saltaneh- in 1942, but could not proceed. Speaks French fluently, also a little English. Returned to Persia summer 1946. Is now too old to take an active part in politics. 161. \ Yazdan Panah, General Murteza Born about 1891; son of Mirza Ali Akbar, a small shopkeeper in the village of Serdasht. In 1907 Murteza Khan entered the Cossack Cadet School. Received his commission in 1912, showed strong pro-Russian sympathies, and consequently gained rapid promotion. Made lieutenant-colonel in 1919 and colonel in 1920. During the whole of his service he was intimate with Reza Khan, and accompanied him on the march to Tehran in February 1921 which culminated in the coup d’Etat. Was promoted general and given command of the Central Division. In July 1927 he fell from favour, and was put under arrest for a short time for an unknown reason. Whatever the suspicions against him were, they appear to have been unsubstantiated, for he was released very soon. In the autumn of 1928 he was appointed inspector of the gendarmerie, but was superseded in 1930 and left without any active command. Murteza Khan was always regarded until 1927 a very loyal supporter of Reza Shah, but after h*5 arrest in 1927 he appeared to have lost confidence in Reza Shah. He is active, intelligent, ambitious, and a strict disciplinarian. His military ideas and his general education are very limited, but he has shown anxiety to learn. He is not popular amongst the troops, but is feared and respected. Holds aloof from foreigners, and is a strong opponent of foreign interference in Persia. Inspector of Infantry in 1932. Commandant of Tehran Cadet College, 1933. On the fall of Reza Shah, Murteza Khan became Chief of the General Staff, and worked as a loyal supporter of the young Shah. On the appointment of Amir Ahmedi as Minister of War in 1943 it became apparent that the two could not work together, and Murteza’s department became quite separate from that of the Minister of War; in fact, the Shah took to giving orders to the Chief of the Staff without the knowledge of the responsitW Minister. Murteza took two months’ leave in Juil^ 1943, but was soon appointed commander of the Tehran garrison. Appointed adjutant-general to the Shah, autumn 1943, a post he still retains. Member of the Perso- Soviet Cultural Relations Committee, Februarv 1944. • Speaks Russian and has a Russian wife. Leader of military contingent chosen to represent Persia at Victory Parade in London, June 1946. Honest, genial and staunchly patriotic, he urged the Shah strongly to oppose the candidature of Qavam-us-Saltaneh in February 1946, but without success. Although he is one of the Shah’s closest advisers, he does not have a very high opinion of him personally, though he is devoted to the monarchy. He is one of the few senior army officers who are incorruptible. He is reputed to have had close relations with the Soviet Embassy, but this is most probably untrue. 5 162. Yazdi, Dr. Murtaza Born about 1900. Educated in Germany where lie is reported to have joihed the Communist Party. * Often represents Tudeh workers in negotiations between them and their employers. In early months of 1946 made a tour of the south and south-east iri an effort to whip up Tudeh support and was res ponsible in large measure for the troubles in Isfahan in April of that year. Often translates for the Russian Ambassador. A member of the Directing 0 * * r ♦ \ &gt; V / i • 11 ■■■Committee of the liusso-Persian Cultural Relations Society 1946. Minister of Health under Qavam-us- Saltanah in August—October 1946 when he used his position to fill important posts in the Ministry with Tudeh members and sympathisers. 163. Zahidi, Fazlullah (Basir-i-Divari) Born in Hamadan about 1883. His father was for many years in charge of the late Nasir-ul- Mulk’s property at Hamadan. Joined the Consti tutional movement and was wounded. Joined the Cossacks and thus came into contact with Reza Khan, under whom he served. Rose to the rank of general in 1921. Commanded the troops at Shiraz in 1922. In 1924 commanded the troops sent to Khuzistan, and helped to arrest the Sheikh of Mohammerah in 1925.

Reinstated in the rank ^&lt;^tgeneral 1932 and made A.D.C. to the Shah. xnber of the Iranian commercial delegation to Russia in April 1935, and subsequently visited Central Europe. More of a politician than a soldier. Made a good deal of money in Khuzistan. Being capable of generosity he was not unpopular with the troops under his command. Married the daughter of Hussein Pimia (Mo’tamen-ul-Mulk) in 1927. Commanded troops at Isfahan 1942, and gradually took charge of all departments of Govern ment; proof was found that he was working with the Germans, and he was arrested by British troops and taken out of Persia in the autumn of 1942. Released in 1945. 164. Zand, Ibrahim Born about 1890. Educated at the Cadet College at St. Petersburg. Then sent to study law in Eflance, where he was a contemporary and friend &lt;^\jawad Amery. Towards the end of the last 0|var became an active member of the Musawat party in Azerbaijan, and in 1919 became a member of the short-lived Azerbaijan Government. After its fall he went back to France, and a few years after returned to Persia, where Davar employed him in the Ministry of Justice as an adviser. He was subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and in 1938 became a member of the board of the National Bank. On the appointment of A. H. Ebtehaj as director of that bank he left the bank and was employed at Court as Comptroller of the Royal accounts. Minister of War in Soheily’s third Cabinet, December 1943. Minister of War in Sa'id’s Cabinets, March and April, 1944, in Bayat’s Cabinet, November 1944, Hakimi’s Cabinet, May 1945 and Sadr’s Cabinet June 1945.

Had sound ideas about eliminating corruption in the army but lacked courage to enforce his will. Married to the sister of Farajullah Bahramy. Speaks Russian extremely w r ell, probably better than Persian. 165. Zarin-Kafsh Ali Asghar Born about 1885, of a Tehran family of Kurdish descent. Educated at the Political School in Tehran, and employed in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in subsidiary posts for several years. In 1923 and 1924 was head of a section of the Ministry and was always very courteous and helpful whenever referred to by members of this Embassy. Served as chef de cabinet ” to Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Feroughi while the latter was Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was subsequently posted to Washington, where he spent more than a year as secretary to the Persian Legation. He 'was recalled to Tehran in about 1927, and served in the Ministry of Justice for a time under Davar, at the time when the Ministry was being funda mentally reformed. He was for a time a judge of the Cour de Cassation. He then was transferred to the Ministry of the Interior, where he was serving as Under-Secretary when the Minister of the Interior, Mirza Ali Khan Mansur, was trans ferred to the Ministry of Roads on the 26th January, 1933. From thenceforward he served as Acting Minister of the Interior until Feroughi’s Cabinet was formed in September 1933. At the Ministry of Justice earned a reputation for severity, which was no doubt needed.

(Received 3rd September) (No. 301) Sir, Bagdad, 22nd August, 1947. With reference to Sir Hugh Stonehewer Bird s despatch No. 461 of 25th November, 1946, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a report on the leading personalities of Iraq as on 1st August, 1947. 2. Last year’s report has been brought up to date and the names of two newcomers to Cabinet rank have been added. I have, &amp;c. DOUGLAS L. BUSK. Enclosure Royal Family 1. King Feised II. Born in Bagdad the 2nd May, 1935. Succeeded to the throne on the death of his father, Ghazi I, on the 3rd April, 1939. His mother is a sister of the Amir Abdul Ulah. He and his mother were confined in the Qasr Zahur during most of May 1941, but were removed to the summer palace at Pir Mum (Arbil) just before Rashid Ali and his associates decamped. He is a bright, intelligent child, though somewhat delicate with a tendency to asthma. His Majesty visited Egypt in April l943, proceeding and returning via Palestine and Transjordan. In 1944 he again spent the summer at Alexandria, In 1945 he did not leave the country. . In June 1946 the King paid his first visit to England. He was present at the Victory celebra- Bons on 8th June and afterwards was the guest of . ’&gt;^ie King and Queen at Buckingham Palace. He was accompanied by the Queen-Mother and the ^ Princesses. Early in 1946 an English tutor was appointed to succeed the governess who had previously been in charge of his studies. The Regent decided that, on his return from England, the King should start to learn Kurdish. He returned to Bagdad on 8th October. There is reason to hope that his asthma has been reduced by treatment in the United Kingdom. It has been decided that his Majesty shall continue his education in England. He will go to a prepara tory school for one year and then to Bryanston. He and the Queen-Mother, who will stay in England with him, left Iraq at the end of July 1947. His health has been better during the year and he shows promise. 2. Abdul Illah, His Royal Highness the Amir. . Only son of Ali-bin-Hussein, ex-King of the Hejaz, who died in 1935. Born in the Hejaz 1912 Came to Bagdad as a child with father m 1926, after the latter’s expulsion from the Hejaz. Educated partly at home and partly at Victoria College, Alexandna. He speaks good English. j j j.. In November 1936 he married in Bagdad the daughter of Salah-al-Din Fauzi Beg and grand daughter of Amin Yahiyah Pasha of Cairo. He is keenly interested in Arab horse racing and maintains a large stable. Became Regent on the death of King Ghazi on the 3rd April, 1939. In November 1943 he was declared Heir to the Throne under the provisions of an amendment to the Organic Law passed in October. Divorced his wife in the summer of 1940. During the Cabinet crisis of January 1941, which led to the fall of Rashid All’s Cabinet, he endeavoured to resist the Prime Minister s demands for the appointment of new Ministers, but fled to Diwaniyah to escape the threats to his life made by the four army officers, Salah-ud-Din Sabbagh, Kamil Shabib, Fahmi Said and Mahmud Salman. Rashid Ali thereupon resigned and Taha al Hashimi succeeded him. The Regent then returned to the capital. During the night of the 1st April the four army commanders already mentioned occupied the city with their troops and went to the Palace to demand the resignation of Taha al Hashimi and the appoint ment of Rashid Ali as Prime Minister. The Regent was, however, warned in time, eluded them and took refuge in the American Legation. Thence he was smuggled out to Habbaniya on the 2nd April and flown to Basra. On instructions from Bagdad the Officer Commanding, Iraq army, at Basra attempted to arrest the Regent, who took refuge on board one of His Majesty’s ships. By now any hope of rallying support for his cause in the south had been lost. On the 16th April he was flown to Jerusalem, together with Ali Jaudat and Jamil Madfai, who had mean while joined him at Basra. During the hostilities in May the Regent remained in Palestine. He returned to Bagdad on the 1st June after the collapse of Rashid Ali’s regime and was welcomed by a large gathering of officials, notables and well-wishers. Since then, he has taken his public duties seriously and has done his best to establish his position among the people. He has undoubtedly developed in character during the past five years and has, on several occasions, shown marked firmness and powers of decision, but he lacks the personality which appeals to the imagination of the public and is painfully shy. Like all weak men he suffers from too much advice and is apt to believe the last person he has spoken to. He was made an Honorary Air Commodore in the Royal Air Force in September 1943. He caused a Cabinet crisis in September 1943 by injudicious interference in the choice of Government candidates for the General Election. He has, however, shown sound sense in his desire to reform the Administra tion and improve the general condition of the country. At the invitation of His Majesty’s Govern ment the Regent paid an extensive visit to the United Kingdom in December 1943. For three days he was the guest of Their Majesties the King and Qtieen at Buckingham Palace. He returned delighted with the hospitality shown to him and much impressed by Britain s war effort. During 1944 the Regent toured extensively within the country and paid particular attention to the army manoeuvres which he constantly attended. In June he visited Alexandria, returning early in July. 35143 B2 In September he again visited Transjordan and Egypt. He paid a second brief visit to Transjordan in lebruary 1945. In the spring of 1945 he was much discouraged by Mr. Churchill’s failure to invite him to join King Ibn Saud and others for talks in Cairo. This led to a threat of abdication. In May 1945 he left on an official visit to the United States, returning via Canada and Britain. In London he was twice received by the King, met the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet and attended the Victory Thanksgiving Service. He also visited the occupied area of Germany. He returned via France and Italy, whence he proceeded on an official visit to the President of the Turkish Republic before returning to Iraq in September. While in the United States he displayed irresponsible extrava gance, spending over $200,000 on jewellery. He has also invested heavily, at the cost of grave indebted ness, in speculative industrial enterprises in Bagdad. All this is generally known and has markedly decreased his prestige, and may give rise to serious political complications. In 1946 the Regent again visited London and was present at the Victory Celebrations on 8th June. He returned to Iraq at the end of July. He greatly enjoyed his visit and there is no doubt that he finds English life and methods increasingly congenial. This has its disadvantages from the Iraqi point of view. He was widely accused of capricious interference in the elections of 1947 and is consequently un popular in Reformist and Leftist circles. He main tains, however, his interest in and influence over the army, particularly the younger officers, a number of whom were sent to England during the summer of 1946. There is no doubt that this step produced excellent results in that all the officers came back with pro nounced pro-English views. The Regent was created G.C.M.G. in 1942 and G.C.V.O., with the award of the Royal Victorian Chain, in 1943. 3. Zaid, His Royal Highness the Amir. Born in Constantinople in 1900. Youngest son of the late King Hussein of the Hejaz. Half-brother of King Ali, King Feisal and the Amir Abdullah (of Transjordan). His mother was a Turk. Educated in Constantinople. Fought with the Arab Nationalist forces during the Great War, and won the good opinion of the British officers with the Sharifian army. Made a G.B.E. for his services in the war of 1914-18. Came to live in Iraq in 1922, and was commis sioned in the Iraqi cavalry. Acted as Regent for a short time in 1924 during King Feisal’s absence. In 1925 he went to England and studied agricul ture at Oxford for nearly three years. During this period he took an active part in the social life of the university and rowed in the torpids for Balliol. In 1928 he joined his father in Cyprus and remained there until King Hussein’s death in 1931. Appointed Iraqi Minister at Angora in January 1932. In 1933 it became known that one of his sisters had contracted a clandestine marriage with Atta Beg Amin, some time first secretary at the Iraqi Legation at Angora (and later at the Legation in London). The Royal Family were indignant, and Zaid was transferred to Cairo in January 1934 as the first Iraqi Minister at King Fuad’s Court. He did not, however, proceed to this post, which he ultimately refused to accept. At the end of 1934 he was busy in Athens engaged in litigation concerning extensive properties which he claims to have inherited in Greece. Appointed Iraqi Minister at Berlin in September 1935. In the spring of 1937 it was suspected that he had been using his position as Iraqi Minister to give false certificates for arms destined for Spain. He was recalled to Iraq for enquiries, but apparently established his innocence and returned to Berlin. He is a pleasant, well-mannered man. A shrewd and somewhat cynical observer. He likes his easy • private life in Istanbul and is reluctant to assume official responsibilities. He speaks excellent English and Turkish. In 1933 he married a Turkish lady who had been divorced by her husband. She is agreeable and flamboyant with artistic pretensions. She is never seen in Iraq. This mesalliance mattered little so long as he was not living in Iraq, but when he was withdrawn from Berlin in the spring of 1938 and came to live in Bagdad it was counted against him locally. But for his wife he would probably have been made Regent after the death of King Ghazi in April 1939. In the summer of 1939 he went to live in Istanbul. Came to Bagdad in October 1941 to meet his brother the Amir Abdullah on the occasion of his State visit to the capital and remained for some time living quietly in a small house.

On his return he went into business. Early in 1941 started a trans-desert transport ser vice between Bagdad, Syria and Palestine. Was suspected of working for Rashid Ali.

He taught in various schools in Bagdad until 1943, when he was appointed “ Specialist Inspector ” in which capacity he was undoubtedly an evil intluence.

During the war he worked hard against “ the Nazis ” but at the same time worked equally hard with the “underground” campaign against the Government and made preparatory propaganda against the British. He was the founder of Hizb el Ittihad el Watani (Party of National Unity) and the chief instigator of Hizb el Sha’abi e. Watani (Popular National Party). He is sympathetic to communism but his name was not connected in any way with those tried during 1947 for underground Communist activity. 7. A bdul Hadi Chalabi Shiah.

Appointed Judicial Adviser, Ministry of Finance, August 1944. Too rich to have to work, his intellectual vitality is such as to prevent his sitting in idleness, hence his legal activities. His governmental work may be partly ascribed to the same cause. More of a student than man of action, but not afraid to assume responsibility and take decisions. Like Sa’ad Saleh, a bitter opponent of Saleh Jabr. In view of his wealth, unlikely to be corruptible. Minister of Economics in Tawfiq Suweidi’s 1946 Cabinet. 10.

Member of the Iraqi delegation to San Francisco Conference, and of the delegation to the United Nations Educational Conference in London, has also represented Iraq at the cultural conferences of the Arab League. Quiet, sober, of a studious turn of mind, his brain is one of the best in Iraq at the moment. Backed by sound administra tive experience he is not afraid to take decisions or responsibility. As a result of his fairly extensive travels is a sincere Nationalist and convinced Shi’a, but is yet the reverse of narrow-minded. Convinced of the need of British aid for Iraq and has many British friends. Dislikes Saleh Jabr and Fadhil al Jamali. His name has never been linked with any suggestion of corruption. His English is perfect. As Minister of Supply in the Suweidi Cabinet of 1946 he was an outstanding success. In September 1946 was appointed Director-General of Communica tions and Works. His unpopularity with the Prime Minister, Saleh Jabr, blocks many of his progressive ideas and he is a disappointed man. 12. Abdul Latif Nuri Born in Bagdad 1888. Gazetted as officer in the Turkish army in 1908. Joined the Iraqi army in 1921. Promoted aqid (lieutenant-colonel) in 1926 and zaim (colonel) in 1929.

On the 21st December, 1944, he joined the Cabinet of Hamdi al Pachachi as Minister of Social Affairs. He talks English well, if rather pedantically, and has always been consistently pro- British.

When it collapsed he took refugee in Persia. After the Allied occupation of Persia he was arrested by the British forces, and after some months’ internment in Ahwaz he was sent to Southern Rhodesia.

Although he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment, the Regent intervened and he was detained in the Police School, Bagdad, and later transferred to Amara. Released in October 1944. H as been described as arrogant and selfish, he certainly gives the impression of being a faux bon- homme. During 1946 he and his wife have made determined J^Torts to return to public life and to win the favour this embassy. 16. A bdul Qadir-al-Rashid Sunni of Bagdad, related to the Gilani family. Born 1894. Speaks English well. Appointed secretary to the Council of Ministers in 1924 in succession to Hussein Afnan.

Public Prosecutor in 1932. Sub sequently held post of Mutessarif of Kerbela and Diyala. Appointed Minister of Social Affairs by Nuri Said in November 1942.

Abdul Wahid, Shaikh Chief of the Fatlah tribe, son of Haji Sikkar, once the most powerful sheikh on the Euphrates. Abdul Wahid cultivates extensive properties on the left bank of the Mishkab from Abu Sukhair to the Ibrahim. Throughout recent years he has steered his course with a view to maintain to the utmost his political and tribal influence. His support and loyalty were carefully cultivated by King Feisal. and all political parties have thought it worth while to try to make him an adherent.* He has many friends and many bitter enemies, and is reputed to deal harshly with his fellaheen. He was prominent as a leader of discontent in the Middle Euphrates area in the spring of 1935. working with Rashid Ali-al-Gilani to overthrow Ali Jaudat’s Cabinet. He had much influence during Yasin-al-Hashimi’s tenure of office, but so abused it that after Yasin’s fall in October 1936 he was afraid to return to his tribe. He was elected to the Chamber in February 1937, but in July 1937 he was arrested and imprisoned for fomenting tribal disturbances in Diwaniyah. After the fall of Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government in August 1937 he was released from prison, but kept under surveillance first in Sulaimani and later in Samawa.

Transferred to the internment camp at Amara in the summer of 1942. He was released in 1944 and lived in residence forcee in Mosul till April 1945, when he was allowed to reside in Samarra. The compulsory economy of his exile leaves him the richest tribal leader in the Euphrates. His influence is still probably greater than that of any other chief of the Fatlah tribe. 21. Abdullah-al-Damluji Formerly called Abdullah Said Effendi. Bom 1895. A native of Mosul. Studied medicine in Constantinople and calls himself doctor, though it is believed that he did not graduate. Seems to have been serving in the Turkish army when Ibn Saud occupied Hassa in 1913, and to have transferred his allegiance to Ibn Saud. Soon rose to a position of influence in Ibn Saud’s Court, and came to Bagdad as his unofficial representative in 1921. Was Ibn Saud’s Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1922 and signed the Uqair Protocol. Went with the Amir Feisal-al-Saud to London in 1926, and took part in the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda in 1927. After this his influence waned owing to the intrigues of Fuad Hamza and Yusuf Yasin. In August 1928 he represented the Court of Nejd, the Hejaz and its dependencies at the Medina Railway Conference at Haifa. The conference was a failure, and when it ended, instead of returning to the Hejaz, Abdullah Damluji came to Bagdad, posting his resignation to Ibn Saud. Arrived Bagdad, September 1928. Appointed Iraqi Consul-General, Cairo, in 1930, recalled October 1930, and appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. This at first was resented by Ibn Saud, and for a short time Damluji’s presence at the head of the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs seemed likely to embarras Nejdi and Iraqi relations, but when Nuri Pasha visited Jedda in April 1931 Ibn Saud stated that he no longer wished to raise any objection to Damluji’s appointment. Was left out of office when Nuri Pasha reformed his Cabinet in October 1931. Appointed Director- General of Health, July 1932, and succeeded Safwat Pasha as Court Chamberlain at the end of 1933. Returned to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Jamil-al-Madfai’s second Cabinet in February 1934; resigned in July and was reappointed Director- General of Health in September. He was suspended in 1935 and tried for misappro priation of public funds. He was acquitted and reinstated in his post at the end of December, but resigned a few months later. For nearly two years he remained out of public life, but in July 1937 he was appointed Master of Ceremonies at the Palace in succession to Abbas Mahdi, He headed the Iraqi representatives at the funeral of Ataturk in November 1938.

In June 1946 joined Arshad al Umari’s Cabinet as Minister of the Interior, but resigned in August owing to a difference with the Premier. He has since been appointed Director-General of the Date Monopoly. Awarded King’s Medal for service in the cause of freedom 1946. 23. A hmad, Shaikh of Barzan A chieftain of the Kurdish Barzan tribe. Head quarters at Barzan at the foot of the Chia-i-Shirin. Exercised powerful influence over the Barosh an^^^ Mazuri Bala areas to the north-west of Rowandi^V^^ Friendly relations were established with him in 1919, but no administrative control was exercised in his tribal area. In 1920 he was implicated in the murder of two British officials. He and Faris Agha of Bera Kapra were declared outlaws with a price on their heads, and Barzan was destroyed by troops, but his country was not occupied. In 1922 he welcomed Turkish agents into Barosh and Mazuri Bala, and in September 1922 his men made an unsuccessful attack on Amadiyah. A month later Barzan was again destroyed by the Royal Air Force co-operating with Assyrian irregulars. In 1923, the Turks having been driven from Rowanduz, Sheikh Ahmad turned on their retreating columns and came into Aqra to make peace with the Anglo-Iraqi authorities. His outlawry was cancelled, and he was permitted to continue in unmolested control of his tribal villages and mountains. In the summer of 1931 he began a private war with a neighbouring chieftain of Baradost, Sheikh Rashid of Lolan. He was ever^^ where successful, drove Sheikh Rashid to flight in^^ Persia and set fire to his villages. Government inter- vention became necessary to restore order. Iraqi troops were concentrated early in 1932, and after some sharp fighting, followed by intensive air action by the Royal Air Force, Sheikh Ahmad was defeated and driven across the Turkish border in June He and his two brothers, Muhammad Sadiq and Mulla Mustafa, were interned for a time in Turkey, but the two latter contrived to find their way back into their old haunts in the following winter. After holding out in the mountains for some months they surrendered and were pardoned in July 1933 and allowed to return to their villages. A short time afterwards the Turks surrendered Sheikh Ahmad to the Iraqi Government on condition that his life should be spared. For a little over a year he lived in comfortable and honourable detention in Mosul, but in November 1934 it was found that he was in collusion with Khalil Khushawi, who was disturbing the peace of the Barzan area, and he was thereupon removed to Hillah. Permitted to come to Bagdad in April 1935. A short while later he went to live in Sulaimani. After the escape of Mulla Mustafa from Sulaimani in the autumn of 1943 Sheikh Ahmad was removed to Hillah and remained there until a settlement was made with Mulla Mustafa in January 1944. There after he was permitted to return to Barzan. He is now heavily overshadowed by Mulla Mustafa in local■■I 7 tribal affairs. His own home-made religion, which is tolerant to Christianity and which brought him into conflict before with Sheikh Rashid of Lolan, led him to arrange for the liquidation of various Mullahs in 1944-45. There is evidence that he is mentally unbalanced and his “ dervish ” influence is so strong that Mulla Mustafa dare not directly oppose him and resorts to flattery and cunning to get his way. Throughout 1945 he w r as opposed to the moderate course pursued by Mulla Mustafa and expressed his disapproval by announcing his inten tion of retiring into the background; but his feud with the Reikan tribes has never died and in July 1945 he came forward again and ordered his tribe to overthrow the local Government. Disorder has spread and the Barzanis, with Mulla Mustafa, are committed to wholesale resistance to the Govern ment’s intention to crush them, for the fourth time in 25 years. Despite warnings, disorders started and a cam paign was necessary to crush the Barzanis.

He headed the Iraqi delegation to the Arab Unity Congress in Cairo, signed the Protocol and returned to Iraq in October 1944. As leader of the Iraqi delegation to San Francisco, he failed to substitute the ideal of independence for that of trusteeship (with Palestine in mind) and refused to sign the Charter. Returning to Iraq in July 1945, after discussions in Cairo, he was coolly received and resigned in August 1945. In June 1946 he formed a Cabinet. It was to be a caretaker Government for the express purpose of holding speedy elections. It developed, however, into a headstrong dictatorship which threatened to bring into disrepute not only the Cabinet and the British connexion but also the Regent and the Royal House. Resigned November 1946 very reluctantly.10 His obstinacy and inability to endure the slightest criticism are the worst faults of an otherwise most likeable and hardworking man. Created K.B.E. for war services, 1946. 36. A sim-al-Naqib, Saiyid The fourth son of Saiyid Abdul Bahman and younger brother of Saiyid Mahmud. Born Bagdad 1879. Appointed Naqib on the death of Saiyid Mahmud in July 1936. A man of little character, but he has successfully acquired the conventional appearance of a Sunni Alim and holy man. 37. A ta A min Born 1897. Appointed secretary to the Iraqi Legation in London, September 1932, on transfer from a consular post at Angora. In the summer of 1933 it was discovered that he had, while in Turkey, married one of the sisters of the Amir Zaid, a younger brother of King Faisal 1.

Transferred to Paris as charge d’affaires in August 1938 and to Berlin in February 1939.

Educated up to middle school at Anah he entered the Secondary School Teachers’ Training College and the Law College, Bagdad. He graduated from the Law College in 1931 and set up practice in Basra. He practised before the Basra Courts until 1941 when he was appointed to the Judicial Service and posted as judge at Hillah. Later he was transferred to Bagdad. In 1945 he resigned and returned to practice in partnership with Nadhim al Zahawi. He always has been anti-British and anti-Govern- ment but came to particular notice as a Communist only some ten years ago. During the war years he did good work in combating “ the Nazis,” but always with.an anti-British bias. After the Rashid Ali rebellion he, with other extremists including Muhammad Saleh Bahr el Ullum, tried to form a society Hizb el Wahidah el Wataniyeh el Demo- cratiyeh. 'Owing to its combination, particularly the association of the latter individual, the good intentions of the proposers were doubted and sanction was not accorded. They continued to work and eventually the Hizb el Sha’ab was formed with Aziz Sheriff as the first President. Previously he had worked for a time with Kamil al Chadarchi (q.v.) but the views and policy of al Chadarchi were not sufficiently advanced for him and his associates, most of whom were employed in underground activity, and in the publication of secret Communist literature, e.g., El Shararah, El Qa’idah, El ’Aaml, &amp;c., and in forming Communist “ Cells ” all over the country. Working with this group were many capable men and the publications, always published at the right moment, had considerable effect. Throughout they were extremely critical of Britain, belittled her efforts and praised anything and everything Russian. Aziz Sheriff himself owns the very strongly Leftist paper El Wattan, which openly publishes in a milder form matter formerly published in the “ underground ” press. The Communist trials of 1947 did not produce any evidence to link Aziz with the underground organisations. Nevertheless, it is probable that his party, the Shaab, is to some extent penetrated by Communists properly so called. 39. Baba A li Shaikh Mahmud Son of the well-known Shaikh Mahmud {q.v.). . Spent much of his early life in Persia while his father was engaged in his various rebellions. After Shaikh Mahmud’s surrender to the Iraqi authorities in 1927, Baba Ali was sent to school by the Iraqi Government in Bagdad and later at Victoria College, Alexandria. In 1933 he went to America and studied political economy at Columbia for five years. On his return he was given a minor post in the railways, but resigned after a short time as he did not like the life of a Government official. In 1941 he was ill in Sulaimaniyah and did not join his father, who escaped from Bagdad. His open criticism of the Administration led to his arrest and exile in July 1943. After his release in November he settled down to the improvement of his agricultural property, but again in February 1945 openly attacked the short comings of the Mutesarrif of Sulaimaniyah. This incident almost led to his arrest again. Baba Ali speaks excellent English and possesses an attractive though not very forceful personality. Is very keen on improving the tobacco situation^n^^ Kurdistan and on preserving the remaining Kurc^P^^I forests. He has considerable practical knowledge of and enthusiasm for agriculture and if not blocked by bureaucratic methods may achieve something as Minister of Economics. Resigned with whole of Nuri Pasha’s Government in March 1947. As a Deputy, attacks the Govern ment of Saleh Jabr on frequent occasions for their alleged anti-Kurdish policy, signs of which he distinguishes in the most improbable matters. 40. Babekr A gha A powerful chief of the Pizhder (Kurdish) tribe of Qalali Diza (on the Lesser Zab River, north of Suleimani). Has always been honest and friendly in his dealings with the Government, whether British or Iraqi. An able and most estimable man, who has been liked and respected by all who have had close contact with him. His rival for tribal influence is Abbas Mahmud Agha, who has always tended to be against Government. Both, however, visited Bagdad m October 1933 and protested their loyalty and obedience to the Iraqi Government. He behaved well after the Iraqi Government established normal administration in the Pizhder area in 1938. On the outbreak of hostilities between Rashid Ali’s rebel Government and the British forces in May 1941, Babekr Agha, together with Sheikh Mahmud and many of the Suleimani tribal chiefs, planned a revolt against the Government. Rashid Ali’s regime was, however, overthrown before their plans could materialise. He visited the ambassador in December 1941 and pledged himself to act always under British guidance. Operated on at I.P.C. Hospital in Kirkuk early in 1947 which may keep him alive a few years longer. 41. Darwosh al Haidari Born in 1907, graduated from an American agri cultural college and entered Iraq Government service in 1930. The greater part of his career has been spent in the Department of Agriculture, and for a long time he was manager of the Abu Ghuraib experimental farm. In 1942, however, he became Acting Director-General of Grain. He was suc cessful on the whole, but his term of office was marred by a quarrel with the then Mutesarrif of11 » Bagdad, Ja’afar Harnandi (q.v.), as a result of which he appeared before the Officials’ Disciplinary Com mittee on a charge of illegally disposing of sixty sacks of grain belonging to the Supplies Depart ment. He was transferred back to the Department of Agriculture. In June 1943 he went to America as a member of the Iraqi delegation to the Hot Springs Food Con ference, and in July 1946 he was appointed to his present post, that of Director-General of Agriculture. His political views have generally been regarded as pro-British. He has, in the past, been considered a “ Leftist ” and a “ Nationalist he now claims to be a “ Democrat.” He is not politically active, but in August of 1946 he was associated with Tahir and Nadim al Pachachi and others in an attempt to found a “ United Nations Society,” the aims of which were stated to be the enlightenment of the people on U.N.O. and the putting forward to the U.N.O. of suggestions in the Arab cause. Thanks to the period spent in the United States, he has acquired many American ways. He speaks excellent English, as does his British-educated wife, who is the sister of Yusif and Abdul Qadir al Gailani. Though apparently jovial he is reported to be over bearing with his subordinates among whom he is most unpopular. His conduct of his Department does not arouse enthusiasm among British experts jjjho have inspected it. 42. Daud-al-Haidari Sunni of Bagdad. Born about 1880.

Educated at the American University of Beirut 1921-27. Columbia University, New York, 1927-29. Wrote a thesis on education among the tribes for his doctorate. On his return to Iraq he was appointed to the Ministry of Education. In 1933 he was made Director-General of Instruction. He has a natural predilection for American methods and is a disciple of Mr. Dewy. In early 1938 he was invited by the British Council to visit the United Kingdom to study British educa tional methods. He was well entertained and shown the best colleges and schools of all kinds. As a result he became far more favourably disposed towards British education. Although he posed as pro-British and generally collaborated in a friendly manner with the Embassy in developing the work of the British Council, he cannot escape responsibility for the deplorable state of education in Iraq. He was determined to do his utmost to resist British influence and opposed the appointment of a British adviser and the establish ment of a boarding school on public school lines under British control. He was finally transferred from his post of director-general and appointed counsellor at the Iraqi Legation in Washington in January 1943, but at the end of May he was still in Bagdad hoping to contrive somehow to return to a post in Education. A year later he was still in Bagdad as transport by air could not be found to take him and his family to the United States. He has a Canadian wife, and is on friendly terms with the United States Legation. Appointed Director- General for Foreign Affairs in 1944. Member of Iraqi delegation to the San Francisco Conference in April 1945. Returned to Iraq August 1945. Still desirous of returning to Education. Is outwardly zealously pro-British nowadays, and professionally always obliging and helpful. 35143 c 212 In June 1946 joined Arshad al Umari’s Cabinet as Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which capacity he attended the Palestine Conference in London in September. He is a self-made man and the first of the type to reach a prominent position. He is intensely ambi tious, but has to feel his way carefully and is there fore something of a “ Yes-man.” No one has ever been able to accuse him of corruption. He is rabid on the subject of Zionism. He has remained Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Governments of Nuri Pasha 1946-4:7 and Saleh Jabr March 1947 but has spent much time outside Iraq, at U.X.O. on the Palestine question and later in London leading Iraqi delegation for Sterling Balance talks. His trips abroad have brought him greater self- confidence but he does not pay enough attention to the internal political situation. He is, therefore, apt to underestimate the difficulties of the policies he urges. 46. Hamdi Pachachi, K.B.E. Born about 1890. Sunni of Bagdad. Belongs to the Pachachi family, who are one of the richest families of the city. He himself owns valuable property in the town and also agricultural land outside in the liwa. In the early days of the creation of the Iraqi State he had the reputation of being a young hot-head and a leader of the extreme nationalists. Became Minister for Auqaf in June 1925 under Abdul Muhsin al Sadun, and resigned with the Cabinet in November 1926. After this he remained outside politics for many years but returned to public life as Minister for Social Affairs in Taha al Hashimi’s Cabinet in February 1941. He took no part in Rashid Ali’s adventures in May 1941 and in November 1941 was elected President of the Chamber. He was re-elected to this position in November 1942, and again in October 1948. Ceased to be President of the Chamber when he became temporarily Minister of Economics in December 1948. Was not reappointed a Minister in Nuri’s ninth Cabinet formed on the 25th December, 1948. Succeeded Nuri Said as Prime Minister in June 1944. Appointed Senator, May 1945. In order to drop the obstinate Tahsin Ali from Defence, he put in a formal resignation of the Cabinet in August 1944 and reformed the Ministry without Tahsin Ali. His Ministry resigned in February 1946. Dignified and firm, he is a typical landowner with the advantages that he has no ambition to increase his holdings and gives a personal boost to any schemes for agricultural development (such as the Dujeila collective farm project). Has taken a prominent part in the Arab Unity Conferences and signed the Protocol. Despite prophecies, he has held his Cabinet together for a record period for recent years by steadiness, modera tion and good sense, which were notable in his handling of the Levant crisis of May 1945. Speaks a little English and French. A violent anti-Zionist. Created K.B.E., for war services, 1946. 47. Hanna Khaiyat Syrian Catholic of Mosul. Born 1884. Medical diploma at Beirut and Paris, much medical and administrative experience and extremely able on both sides. Head of the Mosul Hospital iinder the Government of Occupation.

Appointed Director-General of Posts and Tele graphs in January 1943. • Headed Iraqi delegation to Arab Medical Congress 1943. Elected a Deputy, October 1943. Became an invalid in April 1944. 48. Has him Jaw ad Born Bagdad 1911. Muslim, Shiah. Educated in Bagdad schools and at Beirut and London Universities. After graduating he returned from London in 1936 and shortly afterwards was posted to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and nomi nated as Iraq’s representative on the permanent International Labour Office at Geneva. In that capacity he took part in several conferences. He returned to Iraq in 1941 and has been employed on labour affairs in one capacity or another ever since. In 1946 he was transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs, as Director-General of a newly created Labour Department, in which capacity he attended the I.L.O. Congress at Montreal in September. A very quiet, serious and studious man; wdl balanced and moderate of speech. He holds str^R^^ views on the rights of “ Labour ” and undoubtedly tries to act up to his principles. Since the Trades Union Movement and Labour questions have come more to the fore in Iraq he has gained much valuable practical experience in the settling of disputes and labour conditions generally, and there seems reason for hoping that in time he might be able to do some thing tangible to better the working and social con ditions of the Iraqi working classes. He is not lacking in personality, but is more of a quiet, solid plodder than an enthusiast, such as is really wanted for the task. As might be expected, in politics his conversation indicates an inclination to the Left, but he is neither a member nor an associate of the members of the Political Leftist Parties recently established in Bagdad. He was removed from his position as Director- General of Labour by Arshad-al-Umari in 1946. After bis removal the Department of Labour has sunk into a powerless desuetude. In Geneva at International Labour Organisatyj Conference July 1947. - 0 ^ 49. Hikinat Sidaiman Sunni. Born 1886. Director of Education in Bagdad under the Turks. Also Assistant Governor. Member of C.U.P. Was in Constantinople at the time of the occupation. Returned in January 1921 and was a candidate for the Ministry of Education. Made Director of Posts in April 1922 and Director- General of Posts and Telegraphs in April 1923. Minister of Interior in the second Sadun Cabinet. Lost his seat in the Chamber in the general election of 1930, but became Minister for Interior in March 1933. Resigned from Cabinet with Rashid Ali in October 1938, and from Chamber in November 1933. He played an active part in organising intensive opposition to Ali Jaudat’s Cabinet in the early months of 1935, but refused office in the Cabinet formed by Yasin Pasha aft-cr Ali Jaudat’s fall. Paid a long visit to Turkey in the summer of 1935 and returned full of praise for modern Turkish methods. In the autumn of 1935 he was offered the portfolio of the Ministry of Justice, but did not accept it. Is very influential in political circles, where his intelligence is much respected. In October 1936 he joined with Bakr Sidqi in the plot which resulted in the successful military revolt against Yasin-al-Hashimi’s Government, and upon Yasin’s resignation he became Prime Minister. He13 remained in office until August 1937 when, after the murder of Bakr Sidqi, he and his Cabinet resigned. As a Prime Minister he was disappointing. His intentions were excellent, but his impatience with detail and administrative routine, coupled with the malign influence exercised by Bakr Sidqi over the Cabinet, prevented him from achieving anything of importance. A well-mannered man of wide Liberal views. In 1938, though he took no active part in politics, he was on the alert to keep Nuri-al-Said from returning to power. When Nuri-al-Said formed a Government in December 1938, he sent messages of goodwill to Hikmat and later calls were exchanged between Hikmat and Sabah, Nuri’s son. In spite ol their reconciliation, he was arrested early in March .1939, tried by court-martial for treason and sentenced to death. This was at the same time commuted to five years’ imprisonment. In the summer of 1939 he was removed to Sulaimani, where he was interned in a comfortable house. In April 1941 was released by Rashid Ali and allowed to go to Persia, where he remained through out the May rebellion. He afterwards returned to Bagdad and gradually began to take part in social life. He is now a flourishing farmer and apparently determined to give up politics altogether. His wife is a Daghistani, a sister of Mrs. Najib-al-Rawi (q.v.). jMThe Regent does not like him. 50. Husain Fauzi-bin~Hassan Sunni of Kurdish origin. Born in Bagdad in 1889.

In 1934 he was appointed Commandant of the Staff School, Bagdad, and in February 1935 he was given the command of the Northern District. In August 1935 he became a brigadier, and in November 1936 he was made G.O.C., 1st Infantry Division. A pleasant man with good manners. He speaks good English. He had nothing to do with the military revolt of October 1936. After the murder of Bakr Sidqi in August 1937 he was appointed Chief of the General Staff. Relieved of his appointment 0^d placed on pension in February 1940 for interference in politics. 51. Ibrahim Akif-al-Alousi Sunni. Born Bagdad 1894. Educated Bagdad and Turkey.

On the 21st December, 1944, he joined the Cabinet of Hamdi-al-Pachachi as Minister of Defence. Became a Senator in May 1945. He is generally considered to be pro-British. He is a man of sound sense. He has not, until 1944, mixed in politics, and disapproved of Bekr Sidqi’s cowp d’fitat. His venality has been the subject of comment, but he is quiet and temperate. Speaks good English. He is at present in retirement, but may well return to the Cabinet later. The Regent likes and trusts him. Created K.B.E. for war services, 1946. 53. Ibrahim Saleh el Kabir, O.B.E. Born Bagdad 1885.

He remained in Persia for some time, but after the fall of Bagdad he returned and found an appointment in the Ministry of Finance, Accounts Department. He remained in this Department and by gradual promotion became Accountant-General. Later he was transferred to the Directorate-General of Railways in the same capacity. He held this appointment for some years, but has now returned to his former post. Ibrahim el Kabir has never been a politician: he is a typical civil servant. Absolutely trustworthy but extremely guarded in his speech. He, however, is known to have a very bitter tongue on occasion. He is not very popular, on account of a rather sneering expression and manner, possibly due to somewhat weak eyesight. A sound, reliable public servant, but too timid ever to make a mark for him self. In 1946 he gave evidence before the Anglo- American Commission of Enquiry on Palestine. Awarded the O.B.E. for war services, 1946. Speaks good English. Was chief negotiator in the Iraqi delegation to London for Sterling Balances talks, where he won golden opinions from the British delegation. 54. Jafar Hamandi Born 1894.

Visited Palestine in early 1945. Elected a Deputy for Bagdad in 1947 he has been active in Opposition in the Chamber to the Govern ment of Saleh Jabr. 55. Jalal Baban Kurd of the Baban family.

Appointed Minister for Justice in Nuri Pasha s Cabinet March 1930. Resigned with Nuri Pasha in October 1932. Reappointed Minister for Justice in Jamil-Madfai’s Cabinet in November 1933. Retained his portfolio when J amil-al-Madfai. re formed his Cabinet in February 1934 and remained at the Ministry of Justice in Ali Jaudat’s Cabinet formed in August 1934. Resigned with the whole Cabinet in February 1935, and in October joined the party organised by Jamil-al-Madfai to oppose Aasin Pasha. Owed his continued presence in successive Cabinets perhaps more to the tradition that each Cabinet must have one Kurd than to his personal abilities. Returned for Arbil in the elections of June 1939. After practising as an advocate, returned to public life again by his appointment as Minister of Social Affairs in the Cabinet formed by Nuri-al-Said in October 1941. Resigned in October 1942 and began practising again as an advocate. Minister of Justice in Saleh Jabr’s Government of 1947 and appointed Senator on 2nd July, 1947.

Jamil-al-Rawi A Bagdad!; born 1892, officer in the Turkish army. Served in the Shereefian forces during the Arab revolt. Chief aide-de-camp to King Ali in Jedda, and came to Iraq with His Majesty after Ibn Saud s conquest of the Hejaz.

Entered Tall Afar after the murder of laptain Stuart, which he had instigated. Styled limself leader of the Northern Mesopotamian army. 3n the approach of British troops from Mosul •eturned to Dair.

Became President of the Chamber in December 193^ following Jafar Pasha’s resignation. Resigif 1 October 1931, at the same time resigning from Nuri Pasha’s party as a protest against the high-handed actions of Muzahim Beg A1 Pachachi, then Minister for the Interior. Composed his quarrel with Nun Pasha in November and was re-elected President of bhe Chamber on the 30th November. Again elected President in November 1932 and March 1933. Became Prime Minister in November 1933. Resigned in February 1934, but resumed office with a reformed Cabinet about ten days later. Resigned again in August 1934, but accepted portfolio of Defence in Cabinet which was then formed by Ali Jaudat. Became Prime Minister in March 1935, but was forced to resign by Yasin Pasha s agitation in the Euphrates after being in office for only twelve days. In October 1935 revived the party of National Unity as an opposition to Yasin Pasha s Cabinet, but received little support. Declined an invitation to join the Cabinet formed by Hikmat Sulaiman in October 1936. In the winter of 1936-37 he went to the Yemen to obtain the adhesion of the Imam to the Pact of Arab Brotherhood, signed by Saudi Arabia and Iraq in April 1936, and in August 1937, after the resignation of Hikmat Sulaiman’s Cabinet, he became Prime Minister. He lacks administrative ability, but is a figure in the political world. Is generally popular because he expresses his opinion in an honest, downright manner.15 Throughout 1938 he held his Cabinet together and carried on the government of the country in difficult circumstances with success. Forced to resign on the 25th December, 1938, by a military demonstration organised by Husain Fauzi, the Chief of the General Staff, and Taha-al-Hashimi in favour of Nuri-al-Said. Continues to enjoy considerable political influence. When Rashid Ali seized power by a coup d’Etat at the beginning of April 1941, Jamil Madfai fled to Basra, where he joined the Regent. Both narrowly escaped capture by the Iraqi rebel troops and took refuge on a British warship. Thence they were flown to Palestine, where Jamil Madfai remained during Rashid Ali’s rebellion of May. He returned to Iraq with the Regent on the collapse of the rebellion, and after considerable hesitation was persuaded to form a Cabinet. Faced with the difficult task of restoring public confidence and security, he showed that he had lost his former resolution and energy. An ageing man, susceptible to the intervention of others, he inclined towards a policy of appeasement and refrained from drastic action against the pro-Nazi elements. Within these limits, however, he co operated loyally with His Majesty’s Government, and during the four months of his premiership conditions in Iraq were largely restored to normal. Feeling unable,' however, to carry out the policy of strong action which was pressed on him from many sj^es, Jamil Madfai, together with the whole Cabinet, igned in October 1941. Since then he has been active in the Senate. In March-April 1943 he visited Syria, Transjordan and Egypt at the request of Nuri Said to canvass support for the idea of an Arab congress to plan the closer union of all Arab States. He met with little success but was pleased to have had an opportunity to maintain his part as a veteran of the Pan-Arab movement. Elected President of the Senate in December 1943, in which position he used his influence against Nuri Pasha’s Government. Superseded as president in December 1944 and resigned from Senate in February 1945. His name was widely canvassed in May and June 1947 as a possible leader of an anti-Government bloc to be composed of the Left and Reformist Parties together with a few old-time politicians; this bloc appears to have come to nothing. Is now very rich. Has much land in favourable ^Nations and is interested in many commercial ven- lures whose success is at least partly due to his influence. 59. Jamil-al-Wadi Sunni of Bagdad. Brother of Hamid-al-Wadi, aide-de-camp to the Amir Abdullah, and Shakir-al- Wadi, formerly aide-de-camp to the late King Feisal (g.u.). Appointed a judge in 1923 and became director of the Land Registry Department (Tapu) in 1931. Appointed Minister for Justice November 1932. Resigned with Cabinet in March 1933. Appointed Director-General of State Domains Lands (in the Ministry of Finance) October 1933. Returned to the Ministry of Justice in June 1934 as member of the Court of Cassation, and a month later was appointed Chief Public Prosecutor. Appointed Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs in April 1935. Appointed principal private secretary in the Palace in July 1937, but lost this post when Hikmat Sulaiman’s Cabinet fell, and was passed into obscurity as an inspector in the Ministry of Justice. Appointed Director-General of Tapu in January 1938, and of Land Settlement in August 1939 when the latter Department was amalgamated with Tapu. Land Settlement was taken away from him in the autumn of 1941. Dishonest and corrupt. 60. Jamil A bdul Wahhab Born about 1900 of a comparatively unimportant familv, he was able to contract an alliance with a niece of Nuri Pasha-al-Said and it is to this influence that he probably owes any political distinction that he has obtained. Educated at the Bagdad Law College, he was for some time a judge. A keen political intriguer, he was at one time arrested and deported by Jamal Madfa’i. His attitude during the Rashid Ali rebellion was ambiguous, nevertheless he was elected Deputy for Dfyala in October 1943 and became president of the Lawyers’ Association in March 1946. His first ministerial appointment was in Nuri Pasha-al-Said’s coalition Government of November 1946, in which he was Minister of Social Affairs. He retained this portfolio in the succeeding Cabinet of March 1947 under Saleh Jabr. He appears to devote any talents that he may possess to political intrigue and is said to take practically no interest in his Ministry. He is personally spiteful, ambitious and untrustworthy. He speaks a little English. 61. Jebran Malkon Was at one time associated with Rafael Butti in the publishing of Al Bilad. In 1940 he refused Ger man Legation offers made by Dr. Grobba to publish anti-Jewish articles. Malkon is now proprietor of Al Akhbar, although he does not write the articles as he himself does not write good Arabic. Malkon comes from a large and wealthy family in Mardin. He and his sister were the only two who escaped a family massacre in 1917 when the remainder of the family was wiped out by the Turks and the Germans. Malkon and his sister found refuge in Deir-ez-Zor. After the British occupation he was appointed a director of customs and excise. He is a man of a mild and affable disposition but he has more courage than his meek appearance suggests and has always resisted pressure to publish articles unfriendly to Britain. He has, in fact, resolutely kept clear of all political controversy, a very creditable achievement for any editor in Bag dad. Al Akhbar is now generally accepted as the leading vernacular newspaper and has the largest circulation. Malkon is scoffed at by his fellow- editors but has no real enemies. He visited Britain in 1945 with a delegation of Iraqi journalists and came back full of wonder and admiration for all he had seen. He has a large happy family. He speaks a little English. 62. Kamil al Chadirchi A Moslem (Sunni) born in Bagdad in 1901. His brother is Raul al Chadirchi who was Iraqi Charg6 d’Affaires in London. Kamil was educated locally and graduated at the Bagdad Law College. He obtained a minor post in the Ministry of Finance but soon gave up this job for journalism and political agitation. In 1930 he was editor of .4/ Ikha al Watani (National Brotherhood) which paper was suppressed for its attacks on the Government of Nuri Said. In May 1934 he was convicted for publishing false news in Saivt al Ahali, and in September of the same year he was arrested for publishing pam phlets against King Ghazi, but was released for lack of evidence. He was at that time well known for his Left-wing views. The coup d’Etat of Hikmat Sulaiman in 1936 gave him his first Cabinet post as Minister of Economics and Communications in October of that year—a post which he resigned in June 1937 because of a difference of opinion on the Cabinet’s policy regarding the Euphrates. He left the country for a few months, returning after the Bekr Sidqi incident, and from that time he has been an active leftish politician. He formed the Demo cratic Party, described as “ left of centre,” which includes among its members Mohammed Hadid, Majid Mustafa and Hikmat Sulaiman (q.v.). Given16 the right conditions his party might expect strong support from the middle classes, particularly the younger professional men. Kamil al Chadirchi was asked to enter Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet in 1943 but refused to do so on the ground that he could only take office if he could head a Government formed of his own party. In the autumn of 1946 he fell foul of the Government. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned for attacking the Government in his newspaper Sawt al Ahali. His sentence was subsequently quashed and a re-trial ordered (October). The trial made a considerable stir which his party exploited, but the affair showed that he is no leader. He has progressive ideas but is unable to co-ordinate them or to form any stable or consistent policy. Chadirchi is a rich landlord, cultivated, and a pleasant dinner-party companion. He is no Com munist and has had little personal contact with the working-classes whose cause he champions in the clubs and drawing-rooms of Bagdad. His English is weak but his Turkish is good. He is friendly to us and has just sent his son to study at an English university. As the leader of the National Democratic Party he has given expression in his newspaper to strong views against various aspects of the policy of Saleh Jabr, notably the Turkish and Transjordan treaties. This has again led to his trial on press law charges. 63. Khalid Sulaiman Brother of Hikmat Sulaiman (q.v.). Born 1877. Returned in 1926 from Constantinople, where he had spent most of his life in commerce. Was Minister for Education under Taufiq Suwaidi in April 1929. In the reshuffle of portfolios which followed Abdul Muhsin Beg’s suicide in November 1929, Khalid Beg was made Minister for Irrigation and Agriculture under Naji Pasha Suwaida.

A striking personality with a romantic record as fighter and leader. Supported the Iraqi Government in their efforts to settle the Assyrians satisfactorily in Iraq and thereby incurred the bitter enmity of Mar Shimun. Many of his followers were, however, quite innocently massacred in August 1933 in spite of their friendly attitude towards the Iraqi Government. He desires to leave Iraq, but does not wish to be resettled in the same place as Mar Shimun. Since hope of moving all the Assyrians from Iraq has been abandoned, Malik Khushaba has settled down to a quiet life in his village. Now resides in Mosul. 67. Mahmud A bdul Karim Aged about 32. Reuters correspondent in Iraq. Worked as a secretary in the Royal Bilat from 1932-38. Started a daily newspaper called Al Diyar in 1945 but it was not a success and folded up in July 1946.

Transferred to the Ministry of the Interior as Director-General of Municipalities in November 1936. He soon quarrelled with Arshad-al- Umari, the Amin-al-Asimah, and resigned. He was made a Senator in October 1937. Pleasant, well intentioned and noticeably more moderate in politics than in his earlier days. Became Minister of Justice in Cabinet formed by Nuri-al-Said in December 1938, but devoted more attention to his entertaining than to his official duties. Resigned February 1940 with whole Cabinet. Made a Senator in 1940. Made Minister for Foreign Affairs in Nuri Said’s Cabinet in December 1943, a post which he obviously enjoyed enormously. Resigned with the whole Cabinet in June 1944. 69. Mahrut-bin-Hadhdhal, Shaikh Chief of the Amarat, Anaiza (Arab) tribe of Iraq. He succeeded his father in 1927. Born about 1896. Intensely proud, but wiser than he appears to be.17 He has endeavoured to maintain good relations with the Iraqi Government, though the Nationalist element in Bagdad regard him with some suspicion on account of his father’s close friendship with the British. His tribal area is from the Euphrates southwards to the Nejd border. He obtained a good contract for the supply of labour on the Haifa-Bagdad road in 1940. During Rashid Ali’s rebellion in May 1941 he lost control of his tribe, parties of which attacked and looted some of the road camps. His estate al Razza, near Kerbala, has been expropriated for the Abu Dibbis reservoir and Mahrut has experienced great difficulty in obtaining compensation from the Government. He is now (1947) trying to get the pre-1941 division of labour and guards on the pipe-line restored. This division divided these lucrative services between the Anaza and the Dulaim tribes on a geographical basis. 70. Mahmud, Shaikh Of the family of Barzinja Sayyidis. He has inherited from his father and grandfather great tribal and religious influence throughout Southern Kurdi stan. He was made Hukumdar of Suleimani in 1918, shortly after the British occupation. In June 1919 lui. revolted against British authority, was wounded 1 deported to Henjam Island in the Persian Gulf. He was reinstalled as Hukumdar of Suleimani in 1922, after the Turks had forced the British political officers there to withdraw. In 1928 armed action had to be taken against him to check his endeavours to establish his influence in the Kirkuk and Arbil Provinces. Suleimani was reoccupied in 1924, but Shaikh Mahmud was not brought to terms until 1927. These were that he was to abstain from politics and live outside Iraq in one of his Persian villages close to the border. He chose Piran and stayed there quietly until 1980, when an outbreak of Kurdish Nationalist feeling in Suleimani again tempted him into the political arena. Ai* 1 and ground forces had again to be sent against him, and on the 31st May he surrendered at Panjwin. He was granted an allowance and sent to live at Hilla. From there he was later removed to Ramadi, and in the summer of 1933 he was permitted to take a house in Bagdad. He receives an allowance of 900 rupees a month from the Iraq Government. He has three sons, *Vuf, Baba Ali and Latif. Rauf is quiet and industrious and is a student in the Law College. Elected Deputy for Sulaimani in December 1938 and again in June 1939. Baba Ali, after completing his secondary schooling at Victoria College in Alexandria, was sent to Columbia University, New York, to study political economy. On his return in 1938 he was given employment in the railways. Latif is the pet of his father, and will follow closely in his footsteps, if he has the chance to do so. His properties in Sulaimani were confiscated in 1931, but restored by special Act of Parliament in December 1938. Towards the end of May 1941, during Rashid Ali’s rebellion, Shaikh Mahmud escaped from Bagdad, and in company with Abbas-i-Salim, brother of Babekr Agha (q.v) he raised a tribal force to attack Sulaimani with the object of ejecting Rashid Ali s officials. Before their plans could materialise, how ever, Rashid Ali’s rebellion collapsed and most of the chieftains returned home. Shaikh Mahmud himself endeavoured to exploit the occasion to obtain conces sions to the Kurds, but he was persuaded in the end to disperse his followers and to settle down in Darikella, one of his villages in Barzian. His youngest and favourite son, Latif, is restless and unreliable, and a source of anxiety to the Mutesarrif of Sulaimania. 71. Majid Mustafa A Kurd of Sulaimani, born about 1894. During the war of 1914—18 he was an officer in the Turkish army, and for some time after the Armistice of Mudros held pro-Turkish views. He was an active supporter of Shaikh Mahmoud 1924—26. When Shaikh Mahmoud submitted to the Government Majid was made a Mudir in the Kut liwa. His administrative ability was soon apparent. In 1928 he became Qaimaqam of Nasiriyah, and in 1935 he was promoted to be Mutesarrif. Two years later he was posted to Amara where he remained until 1941. His attitude in the Rashid Ali disturbances of 1941 was equivocal, but he seems on the whole to have favoured Rashid Ali’s cause rather than that of the Regent. Rashid Ali did not, however, trust him and brought him in to the capital so that he could be watched. After the Regent’s return to Bagdad at the beginning of June 1941 Majid took leave in Turkey. He returned in September and was then suspended for four years on account of his compliance with the orders of the Rashid Ali regime. Nevertheless, in December 1943 he joined Xuri Pasha’s Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio, with the special task of finding some means to stop the fighting with Mulla Mustafa in the Barzan area and of redressing Kurdish grievances. The Regent disliked his appointment and only reluctantly agreed to it. Majid succeeded in bringing about a peaceful settlement with Mulla Mustafa in January 1944 and remained in the Cabinet, without Portfolio, but charged specially with advising the Government on Kurdish affairs. Resigned with the whole of Nuri Said’s Cabinet in June 1944. Has gone into business but has not abandoned politics. Made a vigorous and impressive speech on Kurdish needs in the Chamber in January 1945. By the Kurds he is not trusted as they consider he is only interested in the fruits of power. Has been careful to advertise on the surface his dissociation from events in Barzan. Not a member of the 1947 Chamber, he is concen trating on business, he has business connexions with the war millionaire Shibly Bishara of Transjordan. 72. Mar Shimun Eshai, Mar Shimun, Patriarch of the Assyrians (Catholicos of the Church in the East). Born about 1909. Succeeded to the patriarchate in 1920 when a child. Educated in England at a seminary in Canterbury. Since coming of age and assuming the authority of his position, Mar Shimun has actively fostered discontent among the Assyrians. Whatever his position as the head of a spiritual community, his temporal authority is not acknow ledged by a large number of Assyrians, estimated at a maximum at 12,000. His aim has been to establish the whole community in a compact enclave under his own spiritual and temporal authority. He was the inspirer of the mutiny of the levies in 1932 and of the exodus to Syria in 1933. Deported by the Iraq Government in the summer of 1933, he was given an asylum in Cyprus, where his father David and his aunt Surma joined him. In October 1933 he went to Geneva to protest to the League of Nations against the massacre of Assyrians which followed the Assyrian attack on the Iraq army at Dairabun (Faishkhabur) in August 1933, and in November went to England to obtain support from friends and sympathisers there. On his deportation King Feisal granted him and his family a provisional allowance of £780 a year, subject to his correct behaviour. This allowance was stopped by King Ghazi in the summer of 1934 on account of the ft 35143i 18 warn propaganda which Mar Shimun persistently carried on against Iraq. While paying lip-service to the League of Nations and always ready to petition that body on behalf of the Assyrians, he has proved disloyal to its decisions whenever they have conflicted with his personal ambition. By preferring temporal power to spiritual leadership, he has been the means of inflicting much needless suffering on a deserving people. During the year 1934 he was mostly in England, paying several visits to Geneva when Assyrian affairs were under discussion. He remained in Europe throughout 1935 and 1936, spending much time in London. In 1939 he was granted British naturalisation and went to live in Cyprus. Since 1940 he has been living in the United States. His 1946 Christmas message to his flock, though innocous enough, roused the suspicions of the Iraqi Government. 73. Maulud Mukhlis Sunni. Born about 1875. A fine soldier, he behaved with great gallantry with the Sharifian army and was badly wounded. His exploits do not lose in the telling. Served in Syria and was sent in 1920 to Dair, where the agreement between the British Government of Occupation and the Arab Govern ment was reached under his auspices in April. A hot Nationalist, he continued to spread anti-British propaganda among the tribes until he was recalled by King Feisal in June. Remained in Syria after the fall of the Arab Government and returned to Bagdad in July 1921. He lost no time in joining the extreme Nationalist group. There was no post to offer him in the Iraq army, but he was given some land near Tikrit and settled down to cultivate it, with occasional visits to Bagdad and Mosul to take part in Nationalist activities. In May 1923 he was appointed Mutessarif of Karbala, to deal with the Ulema. He is no administrator, but he kept things quiet at the time of the exodus of the mujtahids. An impulsive man, who allows his pan-Arab sentiment to rule his actions. He was bitterly hostile to the Cabinet formed by Hikmat Sulaiman in October 1937 after Bakr Sidqi’s coup d’Etat and openly condemned the murder of Jafar Pasha. In February 1937 an attempt was made to assassinate him and three of Bakr Sidqi’s aides-de-camp were suspected. Maulud then went to live in Syria, but returned soon after Bakr Sidqi's murder in August 1937. Has been a Senator since 1925. He was elected president of the Chamber in December 1937. Attended the Arab Parliamentary Conference on Palestine arranged by Alubba Pasha in Cairo in the summer of 1938. Re-elected president of the Chamber November 1938 and again in June and November 1939. Was not re-elected in November 1941. In recent years his drunkenness has increased and discredited him. 74. Muaffaq-al-Alousi Born about 1894. Belongs to a learned family of Bagdad. He is a graduate of the Sorbonne whence he returned to Bagdad in 1926. Was appointed a professor in the law school and afterwards in 1928 Director-General in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Two years later he quarrelled with the Minister, Abdullah Damluji, and withdrew to Beirut. In 1931 he accompanied Nuri Pasha to Mecca to negotiate the Iraq-Nejd “ Bon-Voisinage ” Agreement. In the autumn of 1932 he went again to Mecca, this time to take up a post as judicial adviser to King Abdul Azziz-al-Saud. He remained in Arabia for about a year and then returned to Bagdad. In May 1934 he was appointed first secretary in the Iraqi Legation in Tehran. Transferred to be consul at Beirut in May 1935. Appointed consul-general at Bombay December 1936. Dismissed from the Foreign Service in November 1937. Remained in Syria until January 1939 when he returned to Iraq.

Transferred to Istanbul as consul-general in July 1941. Recalled in November. A heavy drinker, with unsavoury habits, he is not a good consular officer and is suspected of pro-Nazi sympathies. He was dismissed in April 1943 for insubordination and in the early summer was seeking official employ ment in Saudi Arabia. In 1944 he was living in Turkey on an allowance supplied to him by Ibn Saud. 75. Mudhdhafar Ahmed, O.B.E. Born Hillah, 1899. Sunni Muslim. Married. His wife (who appears in public) is of the Partow family and a sister of the wives of Ibrahim Kemal and Tahsin Askari, to which family, and to that of Nuri al Said, he is related through his mother. Educated in Bagdad he served in the Turkish army as an officer. He was among the first direct officer-appointments to the police after the forma tion of the National Government having been Gazetted Assistant Commandant on 10th December, 1921. He received his initial training under various British officers and by the mid-1920s had established a good reputation in the Diwaniyah Liwa. He promoted commandant in 1932 and was one of’ a group of officers sent for training in the Birmingham City Police School. After completing this course he returned to Bagdad and was appointed Principal of the Inspectors’ Training School, which post he held for some years. Thereafter he became Director, Passport, Residence and Nationality Department, Director, C.I.D., and held other posts on the head quarters staff. After the 1941 rebellion, working under the orders of Saiyid Ahmed Al Rawi, as Director, C.I.D., he was most energetic in clearing up the chaos remaining after the collapse of the Rashid Aaly rdgime. He hunted out and deported foreign Arab “ Nazis,” and was equally active in regard to Iraqis of the same type. In September 1941 he was appointed Director-General of Civil Defence which post he retained until appointed Mutasarrif, Basrah, on 12th August, 1944. Here he distinguished himself by his cordial co-operation with the British forces, but he was equally popular with all shades of Iraqi opinion and classes. Sir(i^ then he has served for a short while as Mutasarrir, Mosul Liwa, and in October 1946 became Mutasarrif, Bagdad Liwa. Mudhaffar Ahmed tias matured slowly. In his younger days he did not show outstanding promise, although he always was looked upon as being steady and reliable. Always keen on sport, he was a keen “ soccer,” polo and tennis player and did much to foster keenness for the first and third (polo had always been played) in the police, and later in the Royal Olympic Club, Bagdad. He has developed into a sound steady public servant and in the normal course of events, being still under fifty, should go far in the service. Awarded the O.B.E. for war services, 1946. An attractive personality. He speaks excellent English and some French, as does his agreeable wife. 76. Muhammad Ali Mahmud Sunni. Born 1895. A lawyer who has served in many posts under the Ministry of Justice, including that of Director-General of the Ministry, Director- General of Tapu and judge of the Court of Appeal.

Imprisoned at Ahwaz and subsequently sent to Southern Rhodesia to be interned. Sent back for trial in March 1944. Sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. Released in July &gt;1947. 77. Muhammad Amin Zaki A Kurd of Sulaimani. Born 1880. Well educated and speaks French, German and English. Formerly staff officer in Turkish army. Was made Minister for Communications and Works in November 1926, and subsequently held the portfolios of Education and Defence. Exerted little influence in the Cabinets in which he has held office. His policy is to try to please the Kurds by supporting Kurdish Nationalists without compromising his position with the Arabs. Lost his seat in the Chamber in the general election of 1930. Again Minister for Economics and Com munications July 1931. Resigned October 1932. ointed Director-General of Economics and Com- n.anications March 1933, but became unemployed when this post was abolished in September 1934.

Muhammad Hassan Kubba Shiah of Bagdad. Born 1891. Belongs to the old family of Kubba. In 1920 was associated with the Nationalist activities of Ja’far Chalabi Abu Timman. In 1923 he entered the service of the Ministry of ^stice. Served as a judge in many parts of the . country and also held posts in the Ministry. In December 1943 he joined the Cabinet as Minister for Social Affairs under Nuri Said. Retained this position in the Cabinet of Hamdi al Pachachi which followed Nuri’s resignation in June 1944, but became President of the Chamber of Deputies on the resigna tion of Muhammad Ridha-al-Shabibi in December 1944. Joined the Al Umari Cabinet in June 1946 as Minister of Justice. The Prime Minister’s inter ference with the Courts however soon caused him uneasiness and he w r anted to resign in August, only remaining in office at the Regent’s request. Senator 2nd July, 1947. 79. Muhammad Hussein el Had id Born Mosul 1906. Sunni Muslim. Merchant. Muhammad el Hadid was educated at Mosul Mutawassit School until 1924, when he went to Beirut. He returned from Beirut in 1928 and almost immediately went to England to continue his edu cation at the London School of Economics. After returning to Iraq in 1931 he was appointed to a post in the Ministry of Finance which he held until 1937, when he was elected as a Deputy for Mosul. He then went into business with Kamil el Khedeiri, Muhammad Ja’afar Abul Tummen and others and formed the “ El Skerikat el Ziyut Wal Nabitiyeh and engaged in a considerable export trade. He is still (1946) a partner in that company. His father, Haji Hussein, is reputed to be one of the wealthiest men in Mosul, w'hile Muhammad el Hadid himself has married the daughter of the man who, by common talk, is probably the richest in the Liwa, if not in the whole of Iraq. Through his friendship with Kamil el Chadarchi, and possibly through contacts while in England, he became interested at an early date in the “Pro gressive ” Movement and w r as one of the signatories to the application for the founding of the Hizb el Watani el Democrati, of which he is the vice- president. He has made many heated speeches attacking “ colonisation ” and professing to support “ Pro gress,” all with a strong anti-British bias, but it is stated that he has always opposed violence and was against the general strike of July 1946. He has many British friends, to whom his frankness appeals. His son is being educated at Victoria College. Is generally looked upon as being a pleasant, shrewd man. In September 1946 he wrote an article on Iraq in the New Statesman and Nation wffiich attacked the Umari regime, as a result of which the paper was excluded from Iraq. He was defeated in the 1947 elections, owing to Government pressure, but he appears less em bittered than others who underwent the same experience. Unconfirmed reports state that he is not unconnected with the Russian Legation. 80. Muhammad Husain Kashif-al-Ghata (Saiyid) Shiah Alim of Najaf. One of the few Arab Divines of importance. Attended the Moslem Conference at Jerusalem in 1931 as Iraqi delegate. Visited Persia on a prolonged tour in the summer of 1933, and returned to Iraq in February 1934. In the spring of 1935 he took a prominent part in the tribal insurrections on the Euphrates, and gave his full support to the tribes which took up arms against Yasin Pasha’s Govern ment. He hoped to persuade them to make a united front with the Ulama in an attempt to force on the Government a series of sectarian demands intended to secure for the Shiah community a greater share in the government of the country. He was only partially successful and, after the defeat of the tribes by the army, he wisely withdrew to silence in the shrines of Najaf. Declared a jihad for Palestine in the summer of 1938. In 1939 it was suspected that he had accepted money from the German Legation to foster anti- British feeling. Issued a fatwa against the British during Rashid Ali’s rebellion in May 1941. His nephew, Ahamad Kashif-al-Ghata, actively supported Rashid Ali and was interned in August 1*941 at Fao, but was released in August 1944. 81. Muhammad Ridha-al-Shabibi Shiah of Bagdad, born about 1880. Belongs to a well-known family. Member of Constituent Assembly and Minister for Education in Yasin Pasha’s Cabinet in 1924. Again given the portfolio of Education in the Cabinet formed by Y'asin Pasha in March 1935. His reactionary views soon brought him into conflict with his colleagues and with the chief permanent officials of his Ministry, and he resigned in September 1935. He became President of the Senate, February 1937, and was reappointed Minister for Education in Jamil-al-Madfai’s Cabinet in August 1937. He is president of the Bagdad branch of the Pen Club and has a considerable reputation as a man of letters. Resigned with Jamil- al-Madfai in December 1938. n 2 3514320 Appointed Minister of Education in the Cabinet formed by Jamil-al-Madfai in June 1941. Resigned with the rest of the Cabinet in October 1941. Appointed to the Board of Education created in April 1943. Elected President of the Chamber of Deputies in December 1943 and again in December 1944, but resigned almost immediately. A genial old bigot determined to have nothing to do with anything modern. Speaks no English. Took a leading part in debates of Parliament during spring session 1947, criticising the Govern ment and getting in some shrewd blows at the British. 82. Muhammad Salih-al-Qazzaz Bagdad mechanic. Born about 1898. At one time came into prominence as a labour leader and agitator. A professional demagogue, he used to thrust himself in the van of any bazaar troubles, and was especially conspicuous in encouraging discontent among the labour employed by the foreign companies operating in Iraq. Played a leading part in organising the boycott of the Bagdad Electric Light Company in the autumn and wdnter of 1933. During the premiership of Yasin-al-Hashimi he was not allowed to agitate, but when Hikmat Sulaiman came into office in October 1936 Muhammad Salih became the treasurer of the Popular Reform League w r hich was organised by Kamil Chadirji with a left- wing programme. His activities became so tiresome that in February 1937 he was sent to live in Ramadi, where he remained until December 1937, when he was released. Little has since been heard of him. 83. Muhammad-al-Sadr, Saiyid Born about 1885. An influential Shiah divine of Kadhimain. Was a violent Nationalist in the early days of the British occupation, and played a prominent part in the insurrection of 1920. He fled to Syria when the insurrection was put down, but returned with the Amir Feisal in June 1921. Took an active part in the anti-mandate controversy of 1922, but after the proclamation of the Constitution in 1924 greatly modified his views. Appointed a Senator in 1925, and elected President of the Senate in 1929. He has subsequently been re-elected to this position at each new session, until February 1937, when Ridha-al-Shabibi was elected instead. He was re-elected President of the Senate in December 1937 and again in December 1938, June 1939 and November 1939. Re-elected President of the Senate in November 1941 and November 1942. A dignified and picturesque personality with an acute and sometimes embarrassing idea of his own importance. Ceased to be President of the Senate in December 1943 on the election of Jamil-al-Madfai. An overpowering figure familiarly known as “ God ” from his resemblance to Byzantine repre sentations of a bearded deity. Appointed a member of the Council of Regency during the Regent’s absence in the summer of 1947. 84. Muhammad Salim el Radhi Born Bagdad 1899. Muslim. Public servant and landowner. Educated in Bagdad primary and secondary schools, he graduated from the American University, Beirut, and later went to the United States, where he studied at Texas and California Universities, from which he took doctorates in Agriculture and Science. He returned to Iraq in 1926 and joined the Depart ment of Agriculture, in which he has continued until he became the Director-General, which post he has held for several years. A quiet, capable man, with many friends in all communities. He has shown no pronounced political tendencies or attachments and this, perhaps, explains his undisturbed service as Director-General of a Department. However, owing to the fact that he is connected to the wealthy Shabandar family— Ibraham al Shabandar being his cousin—and that he himself is a considerable landowner, it is unlikely that he holds any “ advanced ” views, in spite of his ' associations in the United States. He was made Director-General of Labour in the Ministry of Social Affairs in November 1946 and v appointed minister at Tehran in June 1947. He and his attractive wife speak excellent English. 85. Midla Mustafa Born about 1898. Brother of Ahmad of Barzan (q.v.). Was the fighting leader of the Barzanis in the troubles of 1931-32. He surrendered with Shaikh Ahmad and was banished to Sulaimani. There he lived for ten years in poverty on a small allowance from the Government. In the autumn of 1943 he bolted back to Barzan and a few months later became involved in skirmishes with the police. The fighting gradually developed, and Mulla Mustafa successfully resisted the considerable forces of police and Iraqi troops sent against him. In the beginning he was concerned only with his own position, but later on he began to put forward political demands and to pose as a champion of Kurdish nationalism. He won a good dealj^ . Kurdish sympathy and support. In January 101^^ a settlement was arranged whereby he was promised a pardon after paying a formal visit to Bagdad to make submission to the Regent. Thereafter he returned to Barzan, but he remains restless and untamed, and the Government have not yet been able to re-establish control over the Barzani tribal area. Was formally pardoned in April 1945 by the Barzan Amnesty Law, and the Government embarked on a programme of improving security and of developing agriculture in his area. However, he became impatient in the summer and took up arms against the Government again in August 1945. He was eventually defeated, more by the agility of the Minister of the Interior in distributing gold than that of the army in occupying his country. He fled with his brother to Persia, whence photographs of him have since found their way back to Iraq showing him as General Mulla Mustafa in a uniform strangely reminiscent of that worn by Generalissimo Stalin. Recently his fortunes seem to have declined an^ many of his followers have returned to Iraq. W After the collapse of the Kurdish independence movement led. by Qazi Muhammad, he was forced ^ to return to Iraq retiring before the Persian forces. His brother Shaikh Ahmad surrendered with his forces to the Iraqi authorities. Mulla Mustafa with about 500 men attempted to come to terms with Iraqi Government, who demanded unconditional surrender. The Mulla thereupon returned to Persia via Turkey and made his way through Azerbaijan to Soviet territory where he and his men surrendered to the Russian authorities. 86. Musa Shabandar Bagdadi Sunni, born 1899. Elder son of Mahmud Shabandar, a wealthy land and property owner of Bagdad. Went to Berlin soon after the armistice, and lived in Europe, mostly in Zurich and Berlin, until the autumn of 1932, when he returned to Bagdad. In January 1933 he was appointed secretary of the permanent Iraqi delegation at the League of Nations. Speaks English, French and German. Appointed first secretary to the Iraqi Legation in Berlin in October 1935. Early in 1937 he was accused of giving certificates of export to Iraq for munitions destined for Spain and recalled to Bagdad, where he was placed under arrest. In December proceedings against him were dropped and it seems doubtful whether there was21 ever any real evidence against him. Elected Deputy for Amarah, December 1937. Lost his seat in June 1939. Reappointed to the Diplomatic Service in June 1939 and sent as charge d’affaires to Berlin. Returned to Bagdad October 1939, and was appointed Assistant Director-General in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the unconstitutional Cabinet formed by Rashid Ali in April 1941. His polished and friendly manner hid a close and sinister co-operation with Rashid Ali in his pro-Nazi intrigues. On the collapse of Rashid Ali’s rebellion in May 1941, he fled to Persia and was handed over to the British military authorities in September 1941. Imprisoned at Ahwaz and thence sent to Southern Rhodesia for internment. Sent back to stand his trial with internees in March 1944.

Elected Deputy for Hillah in the Constituent Assembly, March 1924, and sat in the first Chamber in 1925. Minister of Communications and Works in the Hashimi Cabinet, August 1924. In 1927, while in ^I^yidon, he made a close study of British politics, ^^ealled to Bagdad in February 1928 and joined the active Nationalists. His ideas seemed to be tinged with communism. Was prominent in anti-Zionist manifestations in summer of 1929. Became Minister of Economics and Communications in January 1931, and, shortly after, Minister of the Interior, in which post he unexpectedly gave satisfaction to his British advisers. Resigned in October 1931 on account of a difference with his colleagues regarding his dismissal of the Amin-al-Asimah. Towards the end of May 1932 he was charged with complicity in the circulation of scurrilous anonymous letters, making allegations against the personal honour of the King. Resigned his seat in the Chamber and was committed for trial with four others by Bagdad magistrate’s court. Acquitted in October 1932. In October 1934 he was appointed Minister at Rome and permanent delegate at Geneva. In November 1935 he was relieved of his duties at Geneva. Appointed Minister at Paris in July 1939. ^Remained in France as Minister to the A ichy ^%vernment after the collapse of I ranee in 1940. Recalled in November 1941, when Iraq severed relations with the Vichy Government, but did not return to Iraq. In 1943 he appeared to be living in Rome. Later he went to Geneva and sought but was refused facilities to return to Iraq. Eventually returned in November 1945. He is now said to be working with the Opposition group of Hikmat Sulaiman and Jamil IMadfai. He is very deaf. 88. Mustafa-al-Umari Sunni of the Umari family of Mosul. Born 1893. Graduated in Law School in Bagdad just before the war. Served as an officer in the Turkish forces fighting in Mesopotamia during the war and was made a prisoner just before the fall of Bagdad. Returned to Iraq after the armistice and entered Government service. Since then he has served in the Waqf Department and in the Ministries of Finance and Interior. His posts included the following: kaimakam in several districts. Accountant General, Director-General of the Ministry of the Interior and mutessarif in a number of liwas. In 1936 he was appointed Mutessarif of the Muntafiq liwa and in June 1937 he joined Hikmat Sulaiman s Cabinet as Minister of the Interior. He retained this portfolio in the Cabinet formed by Jamil Madfai in August 1937. During the first half of 1938 he acquired a reputa tion for taking large bribes, and, though no allegations were proved, the Prime Minister thought it well to transfer him to another Ministry'. He accordingly went to Justice in October 1938. In December 1938 he resigned with the whole of Jamil-al-Madfai s Cabinet after the military demonstration organised by Husain Fauzi and Taha-al-Hashimi in favour of Nuri-al-Said. He is a Senator. Appointed Minister of Interior in the Cabinet formed by Jamil-al-Madfai in June 1941. Resigned with the rest of the Cabinet in October 1941. Since then he has been a prominent speaker in the debates of the Senate, and has been a constant critic of Nuri Said’s Administration. Became Minister of the Interior in the Cabinet of Hamdi-al-Pachachi formed in J une 1944. He has the reputation of being corrupt, but he is certainly an able administrator and has as compre hensive a knowledge of the north as anyone. He put this to good use during the Barzani troubles of 1945, when his well-directed bribery made possible the victory of the Iraqi army. 89. Dr. Nadim bin Shakir al Pachachi Born Bagdad 1914. Muslim, Sunni; nephew of Hamdi al Pachachi, late Prime Minister, and of Muzahim al Pachachi, late Iraqi Minister in Paris (q.v.). Educated at Bagdad and London School of Economics. Returned to Bagdad in 1938 on com pleting his studies and was appointed to the Ministry of Economics, of which he is now Director- General. He has a civil service outlook and has never figured in politics. Went with the Iraqi delegation to the General Assembly of U.N.O. in London, where he took the opportunity of searching for British experts to advise his Ministry in certain matters (e.g., co-operative farming) in which he is anxious to see reform and progress—less perhaps from a disinterested love of the working classes than because he believes that to raise their standard of living is the best defence against discontent and communism. Speaks excellent English. He had already left Bagdad as a member of the Iraqi delegation to the Sterling Balance talks in London in June 1947 when he was recalled from Cairo. No reason was given officially but some con nected his recall with his recent divorce of his wife and marriage with a cabaret artiste. His position as Director-General of Economics remains outwardly unaffected but his conduct has done him no good. 90. Dr. Naji-al-Asil Bagdadi, born 1895. First became prominent in 1922 as semi-official Hashimite representative in London. Continued to represent Hashimite interests in London until final conquest of the Hejaz by Ibn Saud. Dr. Naji then became destitute in England, and was deported to Iraq in October 1925. In Iraq he was soon employed under the Ministry of Defence in the Iraqi Military Medical Service.

Resigned with Hikmat Sulaiman in August 1937, and was not included in the Cabinet formed bv Jamil-al-Madfai. Appointed Director-General of Antiquities in 194422 A pleasant man of considerable intelligence who speaks excellent English. He is violently anti- Zionist. He worked very well with the Adviser to the Antiquities Department, but has lately been in per sonal financial difficulties which have had an adverse effect on his work. There are few of the leading politicians with whom he is on really friendly terms and this too obstructs him. 91. Naji Shaukat Sunni of Bagdad, born 1891. Studied in Constan tinople and became a reserve officer. Joined the Sharif and was at Aqabah with Colonel Lawrence, for whom he has a great admiration. Returned to Bagdad in 1919. Early in 1921 he was given an appointment under the Mutessarif of Bagdad, and subsequently became mutessarif. He showed con siderable administrative ability and maintained cordial relations with his British advisers. He was appointed Mutessarif of Kut in October 1922, of Hillah in 1923, and of Bagdad in 1924. Minister for Interior, June 1928, Minister for Justice, September 1929, and reverted to Interior in the changes which followed Abdul Mushin’s suicide.

He declined because of his objection to Bakr Sidqi’s influence. Became Minister of the Interior in the Cabinet formed by Nuri-al-Said in December 1938, but resigned in April 1939. Deputy for Bagdad in the elections of June 1939. Became Minister for Justice in Rashid Ali’s Cabinet in March 1940. After the collapse of France, he Became a strong advocate of reinsuring with the Axis. With Rashid Ali’s approval he went to Istanbul in September 1940 to establish contact with the German Ambas sador, Herr von Papen. It was perhaps more than a coincidence that just before his return to Iraq, towards the end of October 1940, the local Arabic press published the official Axis declaration of sympathy with Arab aspirations, and that just after his return the resumption of direct telegraphic communication between Iraq and Germany and Italy was announced. He resigned in January 1941, but was appointed Minister of Defence in the unconstitutional Cabinet formed by Rashid Ali in April 1941. During Rashid Ali’s rebellion in May 1941 he went to Turkey to try and enlist Turkish support for Rashid Ali’s cause. After the collapse of the rebellion he remained in Turkey. He was tried in absentia by court martial and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. In 1942 he found his way to Europe and moved between Berlin and Rome, receiving a Minister’s salary from the Reich Government. In 1943 it seemed that he had taken up his residence in Rome, where he was in touch with the ex-Mufti of Palestine. In the summer of 1945 he was arrested in Italy, sent back to Iraq and imprisoned. he graduated at the Bagdad Law College. He later returned to the army and was given rank as a senior captain. In 1935 he attended army manoeuvres in England. On his return he was made Commandant * of the Iraqi Staff College. After two years in this „ post he was promoted brigadier and appointed Assistant Chief of General Staff. He was placed on pension in 1939 and became Minister of Defence in the Cabinet formed by Jamil Madfai in June 1941 after the flight of Rashid Ali to Persia. He made a pleasant if colourless Minister and resigned with the whole Cabinet in early October 1941. 93. Najib-al-Rawi Born about 1896. Sunni of Bagdad. Brother of Ahmad-al-Rawi. Married to a sister of Mme. Hikmat Sulaiman. Has for many years practised successfully as a lawyer and in 1942 was elected president of the Law Society. In 1940 he was suspected of being in too close intimacy with the ex-Mufti of Palestine (then a fugitive in Iraq) and with the Italian Minister. He was careful, however, to avoid becoming involved in Rashid Ali’s coup d’Etat in 1941. Sleek and mondain, he is a prominent figure in upper class social life in Bagdad. Elected a Deputy in October 1943. He represented Iraq at the Arab Lawyers’ Conference at Damascus in August 1944. He has performed useful services for us, but % difficult to say how trustworthy he is. He and fi'is ^ wife speak good English. She is a sister of Mme. Hikmat Sulaiman (q-v.). Minister of Education in Suwaidi Cabinet of 1946. Returned to presidency of Lawyers’ Association as soon as the former president had become Minister for Social Affairs in the next Government but one. 94. Nasrat~al-Farisi Lawyer of Bagdad, born about 1890. In the early days of the Iraqi Government he held somewhat extreme Nationalist view’s, which he voiced as a Deputy in the Chamber.

In the Parliament of 1947 he has spoken much on financial questions for the Opposition. » ft 92. Nadhif Shawi Born Bagdad about 1890. Educated in Military College, Constantinople, and the Turkish Staff College. Served in Turkish army until the end of the war 1914-18. He joined King Feisal’s army in Syria and fought at Maisalun, where Feisal was -defeated by the French.

Intelligent, resourceful and ambitious. Director of Military Operations. Graduate of Camberley and Quetta. Good man both in administration and in the field. One of the few Iraq army officers with modern military knowledge. Has done several courses in England. Command over men is good, and influence on the army high— as witness his behaviour on the flight of Rashid Ali when he took over command of the army and initiated the Anglo-Iraqi armistice. Does not dabble unduly in politics but sympathises with the Allied cause and was heartily against—and worked against—Rashid Ali. His only strong feeling is apparently for the Kurds, and as long as there is friendship between the Kurds and the British his support can be taken for granted. ►^Kttractive personality. Has been military attach^ in London. Was Officer Commanding 2nd Division at Kirkuk and was transferred to Bagdad as Assistant C.G.S. He visited the battle-fields of the Western Desert on the invitation of the Commander- in-chief, Middle East, in May 1943. Was promoted Amir Liwa in November 1944 and later became Officer Commanding, 2nd Division, in the reorganised Iraq army. He is said to enjoy the confidence of the army to an eminent degree. 97.

Of the old school, he has excellent u^mners and considerable charm, but he has hitherto ^►yed no part in politics and little is known of his character and abilities. Minister of Education in the al Umari Cabinet of June 1946. Dean of the Law College November 1946. 98. Nuri-al-Said, G.C.V.O., C.M.G., D.S.O. Sunni of Bagdad, born 1888, son of an accountant of Mosul descent. Educated in Constantinople, speaks Turkish, German, French and English. Served in Balkan War. He was one of the founders of the Ahd in 1913 and came from Constantinople to Iraq in order to start branches there. He was in Basra at the time of the occupation as a patier t in the American hospital; joined the Arab army in tht Hejaz in June 1916, and commanded the troops till the arrival of Jafar Pasha (his brother-in-law); served as C.G.S. till the fall of Damascus. A good strategist very receptive of ideas, clever, hard working, rash and hot-headed under fire. A modernist with an exceptionally alert intelligence. Was awarded the D.S.O. 1917 and the C.M.G. 1919, and accompanied Feisal in London. Paris and Syria in 1919 and 1920. He always wished for a reasonable rapprochement between the French and the Arabs, and dissuaded King Feisal from offering resistance to the French on the ground that he could not hope for support from the British. When the break came in July 1920 he went with Feisal to England. Returned to Bagdad in February 1921 and took charge of the Ministry of Defence during the absence of Jafar Pasha at the Cairo Conference. On his return he became C.G.S. and Director-General of Police, and held these appointments till October 1922. Acting Minister of Defence from November 1922 to November 1923. Held the same portfolio in Jafar Pasha’s Cabinet. Minister of Defence again in November 1926, and retained that portfolio with only short intervals out of office until he became Prime Minister in March 1930. Negotiated and signed the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of June 1930. Visited Jedda in 1931 to negotiate a “ Bon-Voisinage ’* Treaty with Nejd and the Hejaz. Resigned with the whole Cabinet the 19th October, 1931, but reaccepted office on the same day in a reformed Cabinet. Visited Angora with King Feisal July 1931, and again in December-January 1931-32. During latter visit he signed with Turkish Government an Extradi tion Treaty, a Treaty of Commerce and a Residence Convention. Resigned premiership in October 1932. Appointed Minister at Rome, February 1933, but did not proceed. Became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Cabinet of Rashid Ali Gilani in March 1933. Resigned with Rashid Ali in October 1933 and accepted portfolio of Foreign Affairs and Defence under Jamil-al-Madfai in November 1933. Resigned in February 1934, but returned to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in August 1934 under Ali Jaudat’s premiership. Resigned with Ali Jaudat in February 1935, but retained the portfolio of Foreign Affairs in the succeeding Cabinet formed by Jamil-al-Madfai, and returned again to the Ministry in the Cabinet formed by Yasin Pasha in March 1935. In October, after Bakr Sidqi’s successful military revolt, Nuri Pasha, fearing for his life, fled to Egypt with his family, where he carried on a restless agitation from Cairo to secure his return to Iraq. He came back in October 1937 after the murder of Bakr Sidqi and the fall of Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government. He was offered the post of Iraqi Minister in London, but did not accept it. In early December he went to Syria with the intention of working privately for a solution of the problem of the future of the Jews and Arabs in Palestine. But for two short visits to Bagdad, Nuri-al-Said spent the whole of the year 1938 outside Iraq, occupied principally in desultory conversations about Palestine with politicians in Syria, Egypt and London. On each of his short visits to Bagdad his presence gave rise to rumours concerning his political intentions, but these died away as soon as he left. In December 1938 he came back to stay, and a few days later a military demonstration in his favour organised by Taha-al-Hashimi and Husain Fauzi overthrew Jamil-al-Madfai’s Cabinet and brought Nuri-al-Said into office as Prime Minister. He represented Iraq at the opening of the London conversations about Palestine in January 1939. Resigned the premiership in February 1940, but at the Regent’s request reformed his Cabinet and continued in office until the end of March when, with his own collaboration, a new Cabinet was formed by Rashid Ali. Remained in office as Minister for Foreign Affairs until the end of January 1941, when he and several of his colleagues resigned because of Rashid Ali’s increasing inclination towards the Axis. In April, shortly before Taha-al-Hashimi’s Cabinet was over thrown by Rashid Ali and the army, Nuri Said wisely withdrew to Transjordan, where he remained until he was able to come back with the Regent at the beginning of June. Before the end of the month he was appointed Iraqi Minister in Cairo, but was recalled to form a Cabinet on the resignation of Jamil Madfai at the beginning of October 1941. From that time onwards he collaborated closely with&gt;24 His Majesty’s Ambassador in eradicating pro-Nazi propaganda in Iraq and it was due to his initiative that Iraq declared war on the Axis Powers in January 1943. In the summer of 1943 Nuri Pasha visited Egypt to discuss Arab unity with the Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas Pasha. He also went to Syria and Palestine for talks with Arabs there. He remained Prime Minister throughout 1943, but there were many changes in his Cabinet, and he formed his ninth Government on the 25th December, 1943. Resigned in June 1944 wdth his whole Cabinet after an unedifying brawl in the Chamber between some of his supporters and the Opposition, which convinced him that he did not enjoy the Regent’s confidence and support. In any case he was tired and needed a rest. Accompanied the Regent on his travels in America and Europe during the summer of 1945. In July 1945 he was elected President of the Senate. In April 1946 he negotiated a treaty between Iraq and Turkey covering economic and commercial matters but the Tawfiq Suwaidi Cabinet which had come into power during the negotiations wished to recall him on the ground that he had gone too far. When he returned he contrived, with his usual ability to have all his actions sanctioned retro spectively, and the treaty was accepted. During the summer he went to London wuth the Regent and then returned to Syria and Turkey in the hope of arranging an understanding, and perhaps a treaty, between the two countries. He refused to represent Iraq at the Palestine conference partly through jealousy of Azzam and partly because, having been one of the negotiators who obtained the 1939 White Paper, he feels it beneath his dignity to attend a conference whose point de depart is its abrogation. Nuri Pasha is still amazingly youthful and vigorous, both in mind and body, and is likely to remain for some years one of the few Arab states men with an international outlook and an inter national reputation. He again became Prime Minister after the collapse of the Cabinet of Arshad-al-Umari in the autumn of 1946. In this position he missed no opportunity to declare that the long-postponed elections would be free and neglected no step to ensure the return of his and the Palace’s nominees. Still incomparably the ablest Iraqi politician, he has gained no affections from the others by this display of his superiority in intrigue and manipulation. He refused to form the new Government himself on grounds of health, but is thought by many, not altogether correctly, to be the real power in Saleh Jabr’s Government. He accompanied His Royal Highness on his European trip and was selected to represent Iraq at the U.N.O. General Assembly on Palestine. 99. Rafail Petrus Butti Born Mosul 1901. Christian. Journalist and editor. Educated at the Syrian Orthodox School, Mosul, and at a secondary school in Bagdad, he graduated from the Law College after extra-mural studies in 1929. He entered Government service as a clerk in the Ministry of Interior on the recom mendation of Razzuq Ghannam, for w’hose paper El Iraq he contributed articles. He himself also published a weekly magazine El Huriyeh which was violently anti-British but which also criticised the Administration for subservience to the British Advisory and Inspectorate staffs. There is no doubt that he received encouragement and support for this as part of the general propaganda campaign for the termination of the Mandate. He over-stepped the mark in 1927 when, after a particularly venomous attack on the British Inspector-General of Police, British policy and the Government, he w’as dis missed. Within a few weeks, however, he was given a better job in the Ministry of Interior as Translator. Here he was comparatively safe. He remained so employed until he graduated from the Law College when he resigned and in partnership with Jebrun Melkun published El Bilad. Until the conclusion of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty he backed his patron, Nuri el Said; then he switched over to Nuri Pasha’s chief opponent, Yasin Pasha el Hashimi and the t Hizb el Ikha el Watani and became a constant and bitter critic of Nuri and his pro-British policy. This was his first change of raiment: there were others, viz., 1921-23, Nuri el Said. 1923-29, mainly Nuri el Said, but occasionally el Hashimi. 1930-35, Yasin el Hashimi and Rashid Ali. 1936-37, Bekr Sidki. 1937, he toadied to Jamil Madfai after the murder of Bekr Sidki, but el Madfai would have nothing to do with him and, when his paper became abusive, suppressed it for a year. 1938-42, Rashid Ali. 1942-43, Interned. 1943-45, Rashid Ali when he dared. 1946, anti-British. He has been a Deputy on two occasions, first in 1935 for Mosul and secondly in 1939 for Basra. He was rabidly anti-British both in Parliament and in his paper but his seat in Parliament protected him until July 1942 when in a clear up of probable Fifth Columnists he was interned. Within a short time he whined, said he repented his folly and asked for release. In spite of every opposition he was released in July 1943, but on conditions. These he respect|^^v more or less, and in January was permitted to restart publication of El Bilad. Censorship prevented a good deal, but the cloven-hoof showed occasionally and called forth reprimands. As soon as the war ended and the internment camp was cleared, he came forth with all his old-time venom. Recently, for reasons at present unknown, he suddenly removed himself to Egypt whence he wrote saying that he intended to take up permanent residence in that country. His wife sold up the house and furniture and has joined him. He still owns El Bilad although he has for the moment leased it at a monthly rental of ID. 25 or ID. 30. Butti is probably the most capable of the Iraqi journalists and is curiously fearless in his comments. Since he first came to notice he has been bitterly anti-British and anti any Government or Politician whom he considers to be in any way favourable to Britain or British policy. It has been suggested that this is a phobia the result of extreme disappointment at not obtaining preferment as a Christian on occupation by British forces. This has been observed, although in a lesser degree, in other Christians—particularly of Mosul—of about his age. The real reason for his presence in Egypt is as yet unknown, but it has been suggested that it is not unconnected with Iraqi interests in the Arab League. It is probable that he could be induced to support any policy for a consideration. 100. Rashid Ali-al-Gilani Sunni of Bagdad, born 1892. A distant relation of the Naqib. In Turkish times was a clerk in the Waqf Department. Fled to Mosul with the Turks on the capture of Bagdad, and after the fall of Mosul practised as a law’yer. In May 1921 he was appointed a judge in the Court of Appeal. His work as a judge won him the good opinion of his advisers. Was appointed Minister of Justice in Yasin Pasha’s Cabinet in 1924. Resigned over the signing of the Turkish Petroleum Company’s Concession in March 1925, which, at Yasin Pasha’s instigation, he strongly opposed. Became Minister of Interior in the second Saduniyah Cabinet in June 1925, but resigned almost immediately on being elected President of the Chamber of Deputies. From November 1926 to January 1928 was Minister of the Interior. Re elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the general election of 1930. but resigned his seat in March 1931, in company with Yasin-al-Hashimi, Naji-al-Suwaidi25 and Ali Jaudat, as a protest against the conduct of Nuri Pasha’s Government. Became a prominent leader of the Hizb-al-Ikha-al-Watani (the party of National Brotherhood). He encouraged the general strike in July 1931, hoping thereby to embarrass Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet. Appointed chief private secretary to the King in July 1932. Became Prime Minister in March 1933. Resigned October 1933. Appointed Senator in summer of 1934. Helped to organise the disturbances on the Euphrates which forced Ali Jaudat to resign in March 1935 and, as Minister for the Interior, joined the Cabinet then formed by Yasin-al-Hashimi. After Bakr Sidqi’s military revolt against the Hashimite Cabinet in October 1936, Rashid Ali fled to Constantinople. He came back in October 1937. During 1938 he made several speeches in the Senate attacking the policy of Jamil-al-Madfai’s Cabinet. Deported to Anah December 1938. Returned a few days later when Nuri-al-Said succeeded Jamil- al-Madfai as Prime Minister. Appointed chief private secretary to the Palace in January 1939, and remained in this post after King Ghazi’s death in April 1939. Became Prime Minister in March 1940. Throughout 1940 he moved steadily towards a break with His Majesty’s Government and a closer understanding with the Axis. He refused to break ^diplomatic relationswith Italy when Italy entered *\5\f war, but remained in the closest personal contact with the Italian Legation. He also gave full support to the Mufti’s intrigues with the Axis Governments and sponsored the overtures which Naji Shawkat made to the German Minister at Angora in October 1940. In Iraq he gave free rein to the Palestinian agitators and to the pro-Nazi elements of the Press, even allowing it to be stated officially that the policy of his Government was one of strict neutrality in the war in spite of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. Pressure from the embassy forced his resignation at the end of January 1941, but he returned to office by means of a military coup d’Etat on the 1st April. He then set aside the Regent and installed Sharif Sharaf in his place. At this juncture, as part of their war plan, His Majesty’s Government began to move troops into Iraq, but Rashid Ali, backed by the army, refused to agree to the presence of more than one brigade. At the beginning of May the Iraqi army attempted 4*^ surround the British air base at Habbaniyah and ^stilities broke out. Throughout the month Rashid 1 Ali and his colleagues endeavoured to unite the country in a campaign against us, but, though the townspeople were with him, he received little support from the big tribes and fled to Persia after a compara tively small British column had defeated the far larger Iraqi forces opposed to them. From Persia he contrived to make his way to Turkey, and in December, having broken his parole, he escaped to Germany and joined the Mufti in Berlin, where he became a feature of the Berlin Arabic broadcast. Tried in absentia by court martial and sentenced to death in January 1942. Throughout the years 1942-44 he continued to conduct an active campaign against Great Britain from Berlin and Rome and was recognised by the Axis as the legitimate Prime Minister of Iraq. It is now known that the struggle for predominance between him and the Mufti led to a split in the ranks of the Arab traitors. When in London the Regent reiterated his determination that when caught he would be executed. When the Germans realised that the end was near they offered to fly him to Egypt. He said he preferred Saudi Arabia but the Germans said they could not fly him so far. He therefore was taken through the German lines in a car and went to the Tyrol, thence through Austria to Prague where two Syrian friends 35143 gave him a passport. Apparently with the unwitting assistance of American, British and French military transport he finally arrived at Marseilles and thence sailed to Beirut. On the morning of the 24th September, 1945, he arrived in Riyadh in disguise. When he declared himself Ibn Sand gave him asylum. This at once precipitated a crisis in Saudi- Iraqi relations and there were many acrimonious and futile interchanges between Ibn Saud and the Regent. The Prime Minister, Hamdi Pachachi, insisted on regarding it as a personal matter and not a political one involving the two countries. The Regent was finally persuaded to accept this view and seems now overtly reconciled to Rashid Ali’s con tinued presence in Riyadh. Covertly, however, there is no doubt that he harbours this additional grudge against Ibn Saud. There has been a press campaign recently in his favour in Egypt and various requests for his pardon have been forwarded to the Regent. Reports indicate that he is recognised by the Iraqi Istiqlal Party as their leader 101. Rashid-al-Khojah Sunni of Bagdad. Born 1884. Staff officer in Turkish army. Came to Damascus after the armistice. Prominent member of the Ahd-al-Iraqi. He returned to Bagdad in November 1920 and was appointed mutessarif in January 1921.

He was Mayor of Bagdad at the time of the cutting of New Street and earned a great deal of personal unpopularity thereby. Left for Berlin shortly before the occupation, and subsequently went to Switzerland, returning to Bagdad in the summer of 1920, up to which time permission to return had been refused him. Speaks French, English and German well. He set up practice as a barrister and consorted much with British officials. He took no part in the Nationalist agitation; nevertheless, when his father was deported to Constantinople in August, he was asked to return with him. He came back in 1921 and resumed his legal work without taking any part in politics. He has most of the business of foreign firms in his hands owing to his knowledge of English. He was in England on a visit during the summer of 1923, returning home in September. A retiring man of modernist opinions. Deputy for Hillah in the Constituent Assembly in March 1924.

Appointed Iraqi Minister in London in December 1936, and proceeded to his post early in 1937.

At one time he employed Rafael Butti, but soon fired him when he realised his true feelings. Pan-Arabist. According to a speech he made while a Deputy, he had no time for those who supported the merchants and landowners at the expense of the people. “ Parliaments were not collected for the protection of the profiteers and opportunists.” Invited to visit Britain as one of the delegation of Iraq journalists, autumn 1945, but refused on the grounds of ill-health. He holds rather w r oolly views on political theory, but is sincere and means well. Speaks good English. Recently his newspaper has been losing ground. It comes out only two or three times a w r eek and circulation is said to be only about 300. He apparently does not depend on his journalism for a living as he has a large house and his daughters, who are progressive and modern, take a prominent part in the social life of Bagdad. 106. Sa’ad Salih, C.B.E. Shia. Born about 1898. Of a poor family from Najaf. Kurdish grandfather. He was one of the young Shias chosen by King Faisal I to study at the Law College (where he graduted in 1927) prior to receiving an administrative appointment.

During the 1941 rebellion kept his Mutasarrifiyah (Kut) free from trouble. Bitter enemy of Saleh Jabr, who displaced him from Amara (Sa’ad Salih had annoyed him whilst at Hillah). Deputy for Diwaniya since 1944. An efficient administrator, he is less biased than many Shias, and his name is comparatively free of any hint of corruption. An able writer and impressive speaker. In December 1945 he led the attack in the Majlis on the Pachachi Cabinet which finally brought about its fall. Minister of the Interior in the succeeding (Suweidi) Cabinet. Created C.B.E., for war services, in 1946. 4k Now, since the resignation of Tawfiq Suwaidi, ti,i7 leader of the Liberal Party, Sa’ad was very dis gruntled with the conduct of the elections of 1947 and roundly accuses the Regent of bad faith with him and his friends. 107. Sabih Najib Born 1892. Gazetted to the Turkish army in 1912. Joined Iraqi army 1921, and reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel 1929.

He reached the rank of colonel, resigning from the army as a result of a disagreement with ^Hia Pasha al Hashimi, then Chief of General Staff. has subsequently held posts as Director-General Jails, Director of Civil Aviation and finally Keeper of the Privy Purse at the Palace. He leads a quiet life and politically and socially is almost unknown. Appears friendly disposed to the British, but speaks no English. Became Minister of Defence in the al Umari Cabinet of June 1946 while retaining his post as Keeper of the Privy Purse. 110. Salih Saib, al Fariq Has served as chief of the Iraq army General Staff since 1944. He began his military career in 1916, when he was commissioned an infantry officer. He became instructor in the army’s small arms school in 1921 and later pursued staff college work in both England and Iraq. Following a period of inactive service during which he served as assistant director-general of the Iraqi State Railways, he was ^called to active service, became a Zaim in 1940 ^*'fd al Liwa three years later. In August 1944 he was appointed commanding officer of the First ~ Division of the Iraq army. His promotion to the rank of al Fariq took place in November 1945. A stupid man and basically anti-British. He is nevertheless popular in the army, but not with the Regent, who would like to see him go, if only because he was a member of Bekr Sidki’s staff. He attended the Victory celebrations in London in 1946 and came back slightly more reconciled to the British, though full of complaints about his accommodation. So long as he is Chief of Staff, he will be a potential danger to Britain and to the ruling House. Speaks good English. 111. Salman-al-Barrak Shiah and a tribal notable of Hillah, Minister of Irrigation and Agriculture 1928—29. Has been in the Chamber of Deputies for many years and has frequently held position of Vice-President. Appointed Minister of Economics in November 1942.

A lawyer with a large practice and a forceful personality. Given to women and drink, but a staunch supporter of democracy. He was the first person of note in Iraq who openly and independently attacked the Axis in speeches and press articles. Elected a Deputy in October 1943 and was prominent in debates as a critic of Nuri Pasha s Government. Arab News Agency representative, for which he is very well paid. Visited Britain as a member of the Iraqi journalists’ delegation, autumn 1945. Wealthy, generous and good company, but a light weight politically. Speaks French, but almost no English. 113. Salih Jabr, K.B.E. Shiah lawyer of Najaf, born about 1890. Employed for some time as a judge. Elected Deputy February 1930 and resigned from the bench. Acquired notoriety in the Chamber as a persistent asker of questions and ready speaker. Appointed Minister for Education under Jamil Madfai November 1933. Resigned February 1934. Elected Deputy for Muntafiq December 1934. Appointed Mutessarif of Karbala in April 1935, where he proved successful In October 1936 he accepted the portfolio of Justice in Hikmat Sulaiman’s Cabinet.

Joined the Cabinet of Hamdi-al-Pachachi as Minister of Finance in June 1944. Took on portfolio of Defence in August 1944 when Tahsin Ali refused to dismiss senile officers as part of the scheme for reorganising the army, but in the reshuffled C abinet he took up Supplies, only to hand them over in December 1944, and return to Finance. During the absence of Hamdi Pachachi, the Premier, he acted for him. When the Pachachi Cabinet fell it was expected that Saleh Jabr, who was one of the Ministers who accompanied the Regent to the Amman Conference, might become the first Shia Prime Minister. He was not chosen, however. He spent much of the summer of 1946 in England, where he had gone for treatment for an arm which had been broken in a motor accident on his return from Amman. He is undoubtedly the leading Shia statesman and has shown himself to be a good friend of Britain, though a hard bargainer for the interests of his country. Unfortunately, Shia opinion is by no means all behind him. particularly the tribes from the Middle Euphrates. This is largely due to his wife, who is a strong-minded tribal woman of Hillah e 2 3514328 who causes her husband and others much trouble by interfering in politics. Created K.B.E., for war services, in 1946 . He formed a Government after the elections of March 1947 and presented an ambitious programme, largely concerned with economic development, to the Majlis on 10th April. He worked both Parliament and himself extremely hard during the Extraordinary Session of 1947 and laid some of the financial foundations of his pro gramme. 114. Sami Fettah Has been in command of the Royal Iraqi Air Force since June 1941. He is a graduate of the Higher Teachers’ Training College (1922) and served several years as an instructor in Iraq schools. Turning to a military career in 1925, he attended the Military College at Bagdad and later studied at Sandhurst in England. Shortly after his appoint ment as a second lieutenant in the Iraqi army in 1928 he became air-minded, joining the Iraqi air force and later training with R.A.F. units in England. In 1932 he flew an Iraqi air force plane from England to Iraq. He joined the Iraq Staff School and graduated from it in 1937. He has shown himself determined to clean up the R.I.A.F. and to prevent its dabbling in politics, and in this he has had considerable success. During the summer of 1946 he was in London where he attended the Victory celebrations and also visited a number of aircraft factories. 115. Sami Shaukat Born Bagdad 1893. Sunni. Brother of Naji Shaukat. Graduated at Military College of Medicine, Constantinople, 1916. Joined the Arab army in Syria in 1919. Appointed to Iraqi Health Service 1921 and subsequently served for several years as Director-General of Education. Became Director- General of Public Health in 1936. An ardent Arab Nationalist. Appointed Director-General of Education in March 1939. He did much to increase military education in the secondary schools. Became the first Minister for Social Affairs in September 1939 and Minister for Education in February 1940. Resigned in March with whole Cabinet and was reappointed Director-General of Education in April 1940. Retained his position throughout the disturbances of 1941 and survived subsequent changes. Is believed by many to have had pro-German leanings, but he himself stoutly denied these allegations. However this may be, he has done little himself to eradicate pro-Nazi sentiment from the Iraqi educa tion system. Appointed Director-General of Social Affairs and Health in January 1943. Resigned and started the newspaper Baath al Qawmi (“ National Resurrection ”) in the autumn of 1945. It was extremely nationalistic, anti-Com- munist and anti-British. In tone it somewhat resembled Dio Stunner. Fortunately it kept falling foul of the Government and was suspended for a year in the summer of 1946. Since then little or nothing has been heard from Shaukat and his followers. Speaks Arabic and Turkish but no English. A buffoon, but potentially dangerous through his influ ence on young fanatics. 116. Selim Terzi, O.B.E. Born Bagdad 1899. Jew. Educated at the Alliance School, Bagdad, he entered the Posts and Telegraphs Department and has remained there until he became acting Director-General. Presumably his religion has prevented his permanent promotion, as twice or thrice completely unfitted incumbents have held the post, e.g., an eye specialist, London- trained, and an unwanted official from the Royal Bilat. Like most Jews in Iraq he has never been involved in any form of politics, nor has he expressed any strong political convictions. Is a quiet, decent and capable man and co-operated whole-heartedly with the British forces (for which he was made an O.B.E. in 1946). It was the Government policy that this should be, but he added the personal touch which made the co-operation successful. He and his wife speak good English. 117. Shakir-al-Fia'ama Editor and owner of Al Thaghr, a Basra paper. A quiet intelligent man with no liking for the Iraqi methods of administering the supply situation and its attendant corruption. He was, in 1943, involved in a little trouble with the Mutasarrif of the Basra Liwa for publishing articles in his paper criticising the local supply distribution methods. He was told to cease such publications but he asked for such instructions in writing—presumably he w’ould have taken the matter further. The instructions in writing were not forthcoming, but from that time he has been the subject of persecution by the Mutasarrif. A good friend of Britain. Visited Britain as a member of the Iraqi journalists’ dele gation, autumn 1945, and wrote several glowing articles for his newspaper, Al Thaghr, the only regular daily newspaper in the south, has always been pro-British. He speaks good English. 118. Shakir-al-Wadi, M.V.O. Sunni of Bagdad, born 1894. Brother of Jamil-al- Wadi (q-v.). Served as an officer in the Turkish army from 1915 to the armistice. Joined the Iraqi army in 1921. Captain 1928. In 1929 he was attached for training to various units in England, and in 1930 he was promoted major and made aide-de-camp to King Feisal. He was on King Feisal’s staff during His Majesty’s State visit to England in 1933. Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1935 and attended the Staff College course. Returned to Iraq 1936 and was appointed G.S.0.1 in the Kirkuk Division, of which Bakr Sidqi’s was the G.O.C. He was right-hand man to Bakr in the military revolt of October 1936. He is intelligent, capable and ambitious. After Bakr Sidqi’s murder in August 1937 he was appointed military attach^ in London, but a few weeks later he was dismissed and placed on the retired list. Banished from Bagdad in December 1938 f^t intrigues against Jamil-al-Madfai’s Government, permitted to return in January 1939 after Nuri-al- Said had formed a Government. Appointed to the Iraqi diplomatic service in June 1939 as second secretary to the Iraqi Legation, Tehran. At first he seems to have done well and kept in close touch with His Majesty’s Legation. Later on, however, he seems to have yielded to the blandish ments and bribes of the German Legation and, as charge d’affaires during April and May 1941, he dutifully carried out instructions sent to him by Rashid Ali’s Government. Daud Haidari, who was appointed minister at Tehran in June 1941, was asked to keep a close watch on Shakir. Appointed consul at Jerusalem in November 1941. Transferred to London in October 1944 as first secretary in order to take charge of the Iraqi Legation during Daud-al-Haidari’s absence in Iraq. Return to Bagdad in October 1946 to become Master of Ceremonies at the Palace. Minister for Defence in Salih Jabr’s Government formed in March 1947. He owes this position to his close personal friendship with the Regent. 119. Dr. Shawkat al Zahawi A Kurd, born in 1898, son of a Turkish army officer by the name of Colonel Abdul Hakim al Zahawi. Educated in Bagdad and Istanbul. In the latter place joined the Military Medical College, and30 Rashid Ali’s rebel regime. When the Regent had been restored Taha Pasha wished to return to Iraq, but Nuri Said (the Prime Minister) did not want him back and it was arranged that a transit visa through Syria should be refused. He was still in Turkey in May 1944. There were rumours during 1946-47 of his being appointed Chief of General Staff of the Swrian army. These have so far, August 1947, not materialised. 123. Tahsin Ali A Sunni Moslem born in Bagdad in 1890. Educated in Bagdad and Istanbul. Participated in the Balkan War, fought against the British at Basra, and after the fall of Bagdad joined King Hussain of the Hejaz. Fought under Faisal and was a brigade commander in the Arab army at Aleppo. Was awarded the M.C. Returned to Bagdad with Faisal and became Secretary to the Defence Ministry. Commandant of Police in Mosul in 1922, he was removed because of his connexions with the Sabunchi faction and transferred to the Dulaim area in 1925. Between 1927 and 1938 held a number of administra tive posts, including those of Mutessarif of Mosul and Basra. Director-General of the P.W.D. in 1938. Was largely connected with the activities of the local Palestine Defence Committee while in Basra. Became Mutessarif of Mosul again in April 1939, but was removed by Rashid Ali after his cou'p d’Etat in May. Was restored when the Madfai Cabinet was formed in June. Not particularly clever, and apt to be pig-headed. In Mosul he was too much under local influence and showed a strong prejudice against the Yazidis. He was slow to take action against Nazi sympathisers and favoured a policy of “ appeasement.” Appointed Minister of Education in the Cabinet formed by Nuri Said in October 1941. Transferred to the Palace as Rais of the Royal Diwan in June 1943. Became Minister of Defence in the Cabinet of Hamdi-al-Pachachi in June 1944, where he proved obstructive to the reorganisation of the army. Transferred to Works and Communica tions in August 1944 and finally dropped from the Cabinet altogether at the end of that month. Now, 1947, Director-General Awqaf. 124. Tahsin Qadri, K.C.V.O.

Married the daughter and heiress of Abdul W T ahhab Pasha Qartas of Basra. Appointed Master of Ceremonies in the Palace March 1932. Accompanied King Feisal on his State visit to England in 1933 and received the K.C.V.O. In June 1936 he was compelled to resign from the Palace on account of the scandal of the marriage of Princess Azzah. He was later appointed counsellor to the Iraqi Legation in Tehran and took up his post in November 1936. Appointed consul-general at Bombay in December 1937. Speaks English and French. Pleasant and clever. Appointed Director of Ceremonies in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in February 1939. Became consul-general in Beirut in July 1939. In May 1941, like all Iraqi consuls, he seems to have carried out his orders from Rashid Ali without protest and his behaviour was strongly criticised by the British authorities. In September 1943 he was appointed charge d’affaires at Damascus, when the Iraqi Government recognised the new Syrian Government. On the 27th January, 1944, he was accredited as first Iraqi Minister to Syria and the Lebanon to reside at Beirut, where he has been active in Arab Unity affairs, at the same time maintaining close touch with His Majesty’s Minister. Recalled early in 1945 and appointed Acting Director-General for Foreign Affairs in the absence of Fadhil-el-Jamali at San Francisco. Appointed minister in Tehran, June 1945, but in September was still in the Lebanon. In 1946 appointed Iraqi Minister to Paris. July 1947 he was appointed Master of Ceremonies in the Royal Diwan. 125. Talib Mushtaq Sunni of Bagdad, born 1900. Father w T as minor official. Took part in the anti-mandate agitation of 1922 and in the spring of 1923 was one of those responsible for anti-British posters issued over the signature of the Supreme Committee of Iraq Secret Societies.

Appointed Accountant- General in January 1939 and Director-General of Propaganda, Publicity and Broadcasting in May 1939. Became consul-general in Jerusalem May 1940. During May 1941 he carried on an anti-Bri propaganda campaign and zealously supported Rashid Ali’s rebel Government. He was recalled in June and subsequently interned. He was appointed manager of the Bagdad branch of the Arab Bank in 1945, in which capacity he sought, vainly, for embassy co-operation. 126. Taufiq-al-Suwaidi Born 1889. Studied law in Bagdad and Constan tinople and international law in Paris. In 1913 became first interpreter to the Ministry of Educa tion, Constantinople.

President of the Chamber 1929. Iraqi Minister at Tehran March 1931. Joined Jamil-al-Madf.^^ Cabinet in July 1934 as Minister for Foreign Affaub^i but resigned with the whole Cabinet in August.' Held Cabinet office for twelve days as Minister for Justice in Jamil-al-Madfai’s short-lived Cabinet in March 1935 and in October was appointed Comptroller-General of Accounts. He became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Jamil-al-Madfai’s Cabinet in August 1937, and headed the Iraqi delegation to the League of Nations in September. There he handled the Assyrian and Palestinian questions with tact and moderation. Again represented Iraq at the League of Nations in the autumn of 1938, and afterwards visited London as the guest of His Majesty’s Government. There he had conversations with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and with the Secretary of State for the Colonies about Palestine. Resigned w r ith the whole of Jamil-al-Madfai’s Cabinet on the 25th December, 1938, as the result of a military demonstration made against them. Represented Iraq at the London conversations on Palestine in 1939 after Nuri-al-Said had returned to Iraq. Joined Taha-al-Hashimi’s Cabinet in February 1941 as Minister for Foreign Affairs and did what he could to break up the military clique which during 1940 had established a stranglehold over the Govern ment. Was forced out of office by Rashid Ali’s coup d’Etat of April 1941. Tried to join the Regent at Basra, but failed. He took no part in the eventsof May and would have been asked to join Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet in October 1941 if the fact that his brother Naji had been summoned to stand his trial for treason had not made it difficult to include him. He is aggrieved that he has not been appointed to the Senate and blames Nuri Said for his exclusion. He is not well disposed towards the Regent. Never theless, an attempt was made to get him into the t Cabinet in 1942, but was unsuccessful owing to the exaggerated conditions he sought to make. In the summer of 1943 he reached an under standing with Ibrahim Kemal to co-operate in political matters. But by the end of the year he was reconciled to Nuri and joined the latter’s 9th Cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister in December 1943. He was violently attacked both in Parliament and outside, and the legality of his office was called in question. Resigned in March 1944, when a High Court was appointed to consider the constitutional validity of the appointment of a Deputy Prime Minister. Went to San Francisco Conference. On his return appointed Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Arab League. Became Prime Minister in February 1946. Resigned May 1946. Is intelligent and very good company but sly as his nickname (“ the red fox ”) shows. Appointed Senator 2nd July, 1947. Taufiq Wahbi Maroof, C.B.E. Kurd, bom Sulaimania 1887. Educated Sulai- mania and Turkey. Graduated from Turkish Military College in 1904, and thereafter served in many military stations in European Turkey. During the war 1914-18, he held a regimental command, and later a staff appointment with the 13th Corps, commanded by General Ali Ihsan Pasha. After the war he returned to Iraq, and entered the Iraqi army. He was appointed Military Adviser and Staff Officer to Shaikh Mahmud in Sulaimania in 1923, but left him when his attitude became pro- Turkish and his conduct impossible. He returned to Bagdad and re-entered the army, and with the rank of colonel became Commandant of the ^Military College, Bagdad. In 1929 he was sent on a course to the United Kingdom. In April 1930 he was appointed as Mutessarif of Sulaimania, but lasted only until July, when as the result of election troubles he was removed. For several years he remained unemployed, but ^jmately obtained appointment to the post of ^^Director-General of Surveys. After the conclusion of the operations against Rashid Ali, Taufiq Wahbi resigned from Government service, took pension and made a comfortable fortune as a contractor for the British forces. In June 1944 he was appointed Minister of Economics in Hamdi Pachachi’s Cabinet, in which capacity he has toured the north to investigate possible relief and developments. It was largely owing to his initiative that the Director of the Sudan Forestry Service was engaged to prepare a compre hensive survey of the economic possibilities of forestry in Kurdistan. To the young Kurdish nationalists and hot-heads he pleads moderation and gradualism, but his influence on them is not effective. Taufiq Wahbi is keenly interested in Kurdish culture, and has devoted much time to modernising the Kurdish language. He has given valuable help to the Information Department of the embassy in the production of propaganda in Kurdish. A charming and cultivated man who speaks good English, Persian and Turkish. Created C.B.E., for war services, in 1946. Minister for Education in Salih Jabr’s 1947 Cabinet. 128. Thabit A bdul Nur Born 1890. Son of Aziz Abdul Nur, a prominent Jacobite Christian of Mosul.

This post was abolished and he was appointed Iraqi Oil Representative in London in July 1934. Appointed Director of Oil Affairs in the Ministry of Economics and Communi cations in June 1935. His post was abolished in November 1936, and he remained without employ ment until December 1937, when he was appointed to the Iraqi Diplomatic Service. Early in 1938 he was appointed Iraqi Charg6 d’Affaires at Jedda. There he put forward a number of fantastic proposals to the Saudi Arabian Govern ment for which he had been given no authority by the Iraqi Government. The Saudi Government soon detected the folly of his schemes and gave up taking him seriously. In December 1938 and January 1939 he was in Sanaa visiting the King of the Yemen. He was on leave in Germany on the outbreak of w r ar in September 1939 and chose to remain there rather than return to Iraq. It is believed that he helped in the preparation of Arabic broadcasts from Berlin. He is now living in retirement at Lausanne and has shown no sign of wishing to return to Iraq. 129. Umar Nazmi Kurd.

Owung to his discharge from the railway directorate, which, while being an Iraqi Department, has a British director, he was somewhat embittered against the British. He is an active member of a group of advocates known to have advised the Railway Union to strike. He was for a time a member of Kamil Chadirchi’s Demo cratic Party, but resigned following personal differences. He visited Britain with a party of journalists in autumn of 1945, and stayed on in Britain for several months.

He is personally very friendly with us and has not published any anti-British articles or comments for some time. He is outstanding among the young Socialists. His English is rapidly improving. 131. Tunis Bahri Born about 1904. Of the Jubur tribe of Mosul From his early days he has been well known for his unprincipled character and immoral private life. From 1923 to 1926 he held minor clerical posts in Government offices. In June 1926 he went on a journey round the. world and was repatriated destitute from Paris after having served a term of imprisonment for a misdemeanour. Between 1929 and 1933 he travelled in Arab countries, including Tripoli, Tunis and the Hadhramaut, and also Java, India, Afghanistan and Iran. On his return to Iraq he took up journalism and gave his support to extreme nationalism. He also published a news paper called Al JJqab. He was subsidised in 1935-36 to publish articles favouring the Italian conquest of Abyssinia and in 1936 he sold himself to the German Legation. ’In April 1939 he went to Berlin and soon afterwards became the announcer of the Berlin Arabic broadcast. In this position he has been very successful, and his broadcasts were a powerful instrument of German propaganda. In the spring of 1942 he “ went off the air ” and it is rumoured that he was put into an internment camp in Germany. Broadcast from Berlin in connexion with the Lebanese crisis of November 1943. In the autumn of 1946 he was living in Paris, under the name of B. Jabourij, and w r as in corres pondence with former friends in Bagdad.

Note on Titles, &amp;c. 1. Sherif. —Said to apply strictly in Arabia to persons recognised as being in the direct male descent from Hasan, the son of the Caliph Ali. There is, however, much confusion as to the exact meaning of this and the following term. 2. Seyyid. —Said to apply in Arabia, though much abused in some other countries, only to persons recognised as being in the male descent from seyn, the son of ’Ali. Amir. —Given as a title to all princes of the blood and describes the office of practically all provincial governors. 4. Sheykh .—Applied very widely, but not indis criminately, not only to tribal personages, but to townsmen of consequence, especially, perhaps, though not exclusively, to those in official positions, e.g., Sheykh Yusuf Yasin. 5. Bey .—Still used, sometimes in preference to Sheykh, by persons who would have been so called by right or courtesy in the Turkish system and who , may dislike the association of “ Sheykh ” with age or desert life, e.g., Fuad Bey Hamza. 6. Hajji. —Convenient, in a country where every Hejazi adult has made the pilgrimage, for certain persons not otherwise easy to give a title to, e.g., Hajji Yusuf Zeinal. 7. Effendi. —Still applied to persons hardly entitled to be called Sheykh or anything equally honorific, e.g., Muhammad Effendi ’Ali Ridha. Ibn, (fc.—Means, like its variant, Bin, “ son or by extension, “ descendant of.” Replaced ^sometimes by the article “ al,” which it is not always easy to distinguish from ” al,” meaning “ of the house of.” All four forms are illustrated by the name of the King, “ ’Abdul-’Aziz ibn (son of) ’Abdurrahman al (son of) Faysal al (of the house of) Sa’ud,” and the abbreviated names ibn Sa’ud or bin Sa’ud. The use of the patronymic ” Ibn So-and- ? So ” is so common as often to make a man’s personal name difficult to trace. 9. Abu .—Means “ father.” Used in combination with the name of an actual son or the name of an object to form a familiar name or nickname, which sometimes becomes an accredited surname. Thus, Colonel Glubb is known in the desert as “Abu Hunaik,” or the father of the Little Jaw. Similar names are sometimes formed from other terms of relationship. 10. Composition of Names. —The most normal formation is to build from a person’s own name by adding that of his father and sometimes names of remoter ancestors and/or a family name. It is not uncommon to omit at least the first Ibn and place the father’s name immediately after that of the person described, e.g., ’Abdullah Ibrahim al-Fadhl. It cannot be assumed, however, that the second of two unseparated names is that of the father, especially if the first be Muhammad, which is often little more than a prefix. 11. The following index gives, except in two cases, the first name of all living Arabs mentioned other wise than incidentally in the report, but where Muhammad appears to be no more than a prefix it is reduced to M. and ignored for purposes of alpha betical order. Secondary entries have been made in many, but not in all, cases, where a patronymic or a family name seems likely to help to trace particular individuals: — ’Abadila. 52 ’Abbas ibn Yusuf Qattan. 44 (2) Abdul-’Aziz ibn Abdurrahman.

Royal Family. (1) ’Abdul-’Aziz ibn 'Abdur-Rahman al-Feysal dl Sa’ud. —Ki'ng of Sa’udi Arabia, commonly known as Ibn Sa’ud. Born probably in 1882. Accompanied father on flight from Riyadh upon its occupation by Ibn Rashid in 1891. Grew up under tutelage of Sheykh Mubarak of Kuwait, who gave asylum to family. Seized opportunity in course of local warfare in Eastern Arabia to deliver surprise attack on Riyadh in January 1902 with very small force and retook it. Became recognised head of the family although his father ’Abdurrahman survived until 1928. Extended • his authority gradually over whole of Nejd and Qasim • and in 1914 took the coastal province of Hasa from the Turks, who then made an agreement with him. Entered into treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government through the Government of India in 1915. Took Hail in 1921 and finally destroyed power of Beni Rashid. Next fought King Huseyn, an old enemy. Took Mecca in 1924 and completed con quest of Hejaz by compelling abdication at end of 1925 of Huseyn’s son and successor ’AH. Acquired suzerainty over ’Asir in 1926. Converted position into one of practical sovereignty in 1930 and later reduced ’Asir to status of ordinary province, follow ing on repression of a rebellion there. Consolidated this position by the Sa’udi-Yemen Treaty of Taif of th£ 20th May, 1934, which secured his legal title to Hr and Najran. Has thus become ruler of territory, seaboards of which extend from just south of Aqaba to just north of Medi in Yemen and 1 om Kuwait neutral zone to north of Qatar Peninsula. Ibn Sa’ud has measured his titles by his acquisi tions. He became in 1902 Amir of Nejd and Imam of the Wahhabis; in 1921 Sultan of Nejd and its Dependencies; in January 1926 King of the Hejaz; in 1927 King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies; and finally in September 1932 King of the Kingdom of Sa’udi Arabia, defined as a single and united State, comprising his existing dominions, though without express mention of ’Asir. The hero of this spectacular aggrandisement is a man of fine presence, some 6 foot 3 inches in height and handsome except for a blotch across the left eye due to neglected leucoma. He combines a strong character with courage, much native shrewdness and a charm which, though now a little stereotyped, is still attractive. He is feared rather than loved by his subjects on all of whom except those of the Shi’a ^^■suasion he imposes at least the forms of ^vvahhabism. His own Wahhabism is sincere, but tempered by a readiness to compromise when his temporal position requires innovations contrary to the prejudice of extremists or sometimes even to the original principles of his sect. On his own ground he is an efficient ruler and a hard one, a Napoleon of the desert, but too much of the desert to cope quite successfully with the problems with which his con quest of the Hejaz and his attainment of an inter national position have confronted him. In diplomacy he is normally fairly honest, but difficult. He is as well disposed towards foreigners as is compatible with his fundamental belief that Islam is all in all. He has tried a strong constitution very high by living hard and by innumerable marriages. It was reckoned some years ago that he had already had over 200 wives, though never more than the permitted four at a time. He is known to find the natural decline in his powers in this direction dis concerting. Was made a G.C.I.E. in 1920, but does not now greatly prize an honour which he considers too reminiscent of a past connexion with the Govern ment of India only and in some sense vassalish. Received the G.C.B. in November 1935, at the time of the visit to Riyadh of Sir Andrew Ryan. His relations with Great Britain have been mainly friendly, and since 1939 he has acted as though he firmly believed in his repeated asseverations, that his interests and those of the Arabs in general are bound up with those of His Majesty’s Government. In earlier editions he was described as expecting much for love, but his attitude throughout the Palestine crisis of 1937-39 and during Rashid Aly’s rebellion in Iraq in 1941 entitles him to the cancella tion of that description. He was unwavering in his sympathy for the Allied cause throughout the present war and he proved by his acts that he is ready to give “ his friends, the British Govern ment,” every support possible. In January 1945 King Farouqof Egypt visited Ibn Sa’ud at Yenbo. The visit was ostensibly a private one, but was marked with much oriental pageantry and much publicity. This was followed by a visit from the Syrian President, Shukri Kuwatly, early in February. In the same month, Ibn Sa’ud, at the invitation of President Roose velt, who was on his way home from the Yalta confer ence, went to Egypt on a United States destroyer and met the President at the Bitter Lakes. As Mr. Chur chill was also in Egypt at the same time, the King was very anxious to see him, and a meeting was arranged in the Fayoum on the 17th February. He returned to Jedda on a British cruiser, His Majesty’s Ship Aurora, after an absence of eight days. On the 1st March, Ibn Sa’ud declared war on Germany and Japan (with reservations in respect of the Holy Places) thus qualifying Sa’udi Arabia for membership of the United Nations and participation in the San Francisco Conference. A personal visit by the \ iceroy of India to Riyadh, on his way to India, in early June gave the King great pleasure. British army medical specialists who examined the King in February at his request, found that his general physical condition was excellent and his expectation of life unusually good for a man of his age, but warned him against abuse of the stimulants upon which his private life now depends for its satisfaction and prestige. He is, however, much crippled by arthritis in both knees and cannot, for instance, walk up or down any stairs. The strains set up by Rashid Ali al Gailani’s un fortunate arrival as a suppliant for sanctuary in Riyadh in September 1945, and by the elevation of Ibn Sand’s dynastic enemy, the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan, to independent Kingship, have increased Ibn Saud’s unsleeping suspicions of Hashemite designs against him; and the abandon ment of His Majesty’s Government’s 1939 White Paper policy in Palestine was a grievous shock to him. He used his influence constantly, however, to urge caution and a realistic outlook upon other Arab leaders, and to avert at all costs a hostile Anglo- Arab confrontation. A State visit to Egypt lasting from 10th to 22nd January, 1946, considerably exhausted Ibn Sand, but a few weeks in his desert camp at Rawdat Khafs availed to re-establish his health and vigour. He made his first aeroplane flight, from Afif to Taif, in September 1945. Ibn Sand came to the Hejaz for the pilgrimage in the autumn of 1946, when many of those who had not seen him for some time noticed that he had aged markedly and seemed to be very tired. Indeed, one dinner party was cut short by his Majesty’s dozing off soon after the repast. However, a few weeks in the more bracing climate of Riyadh, whither the King returned by air, seem largely to have restored his vigour. Between 21st and 29th January, 1947, Ibn Sand paid his first official visit to the oilfields near the Persian Gulf coast. A very full and costly pro gramme of entertainment was arranged by the Arabian American Oil Company. The Shaikh of Kuwait visited Ibn Saud at Riyadh between 31st May and 21st June, 1947. He is reported by the Political Agent in Kuwait to have benefited by the change and to have acquired from the King’s company a new confidence and authority in dealing with his own relatives and subjects. p q 349614 In the autumn of 1947, the King spent several weeks at Hofuf in the Hasa oasis, in the hope that the warm springs there would help to relieve his arthritis, which had been troubling him more than usual. The visit of a party of Egyptian doctors to supervise his “ cure ” gave rise to a wave of rumours throughout the Middle East that his Majesty was in failing health, and the Saudi Arabian Government felt obliged to issue a formal dementi. He appeared to members of the legation staff, who visited him at Hofuf, to be in no w r orse health than usual; however, he decided not to per form the pilgrimage which, with its elaborate cere monial and many social obligations, imposes con siderable strain on the sovereign or his representa tive. The King’s eldest son Turki died in 1919, leaving issue. The following is a list of the King’s immediate relatives, many of w’hom also have issue. Philby s Arabia is probably the best English authority on the Sa’ud family as a whole, but does not claim to be absolutely accurate. Sons. All Amirs. (2) Sa’ud ibn ’Abdul-’Aziz.—Born at Kuwait in 1901 or early 1902 of a lady of Sa’udi stock. Has for some years been Viceroy of Nejd, and until 1934 seldom visited the Hejaz. Until 1935 he was less travelled than his half-brother, Amir Feysal, having only left the country once when he went to consult an oculist in Egypt shortly after the “ Mahmal ” incident of 1926' In 1935, however, he visited Europe and visited several capitals including London where he stayed about five weeks (he received the G.B.E. on that occasion), and he represented Sa’udi Arabia at the Silver Jubilee and at the Coronation of His Majesty King George VI. In 1940 he visited India. Sa’ud’s designation as Heir to the Throne was formally announced on the 11th May, 1933. He resembles his father in appearance and physique. Also suffers from eye trouble, but has inherited Ibn Sa’ud’s “ magnetic smile.” Said to have had some schooling from Dr. ’Abdullah Damluji and Sheykh Hafiz Wahba, but to be in the main untutored. May in other respects be a chip of the old block, but has had little opportunity of displaying his quality to Europeans. Is strongly Islamic, but since his return from Europe has shown many signs of a broadened outlook and little, if any, of the fanaticism which seemed to characterise him earlier. Had com manded on the Eastern front in the Sa’udi-Yemen war. He now affects a European style of entertain ing—even serving afternoon tea to his English visitors—and prides himself on his skill in the management of Christian cutlery, to the amusement of his father, who calls him ‘‘ Sa’ud the Civilised.” He professes a desire to see Sa’udi Arabia progress on Western lines (e.g., introduction of air com munications, modern architecture, &amp;c.). He claims that he himself designed his country house at Badia near Riyadh, the amenities of which include a swimming pool. He owns a cinema projector and shows British news films. When His Majesty’s Minister visited Riyadh in February 1942 Sa’ud broke with Arabian custom by inviting the ladies of the party to dinner. His eldest son, Fahad, was born about 1925, and was married to a daughter of the Amir Faysal, No. 1 (3), in May 1943. Is being allowed by his father to take an increasing share in the internal administration of the country and is present at many of the audiences between His Majesty’s representatives and the King. Appointed Commander-in-chief of the Sa’udi army in March 1944. Came to Mecca on pilgrimage in November 1945 and acted as Viceroy during his father’s visit to Egypt, January 1946. Attended the meeting of heads of Arab States in Egypt 28th-30th May, 1946, but as a figure-head only, King Farouq having been appointed as Ibn Saud’s spokesman. The Amir Saud has latterly been at pains to indicate that his father’s policy of friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government is emphatically his own, also. In January 1947 flew' to the United States for a visit as the guest of the United States Government and of various American firms with Arabian interests. On the return journey visited the United Kingdom between 20th February and 1st March, as the guest of His Majesty’s Government. Unfor tunately, this visit coincided with a spell of exceptionally cold weather in England, and keeping the Amir and his party adequately fed and warmed, let alone entertained, created a considerable problem for those who were responsible for their programme. Performed the pilgrimage in 1947, taking in the ceremonies the place of his father who, for reasons of health, apparently, decided at the last moment to remain in Riyadh. (3) Faysal ibn ’Abdul-’Aziz.—Yiceroy of the Hejaz in his father’s absence and permanently President of the Council of Ministers, Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Interior, and, in theory, War. Born of a lady of the family of ’Abdul-Wahhab in or about 1905. ' Educated partly by Sheykh Hafiz Wahba. Intelligent and has at least had more opportunity than most of his brothers of cultivating his intelligence and powers of observation as he has lived mostly of late years in the comparatively civilised surroundings of Mecca and has travelled^Jy^' Europe : in 1919, when he was in England; in 19zoT' when he visited England, France, Holland and per haps other countries; and in 1932, when he headed the Sa’udi mission which visited London and many other capitals, and often since. In physique a much feebler version of his father and elder brother owing to excessive delight in the harem from his youth upwards. At first very listless and rather nervous in European company, but could rise to an occasion, as he showed in 1932 by playing his part in London, albeit that of a figurehead, with a good deal of distinction. Believed not to see eye to eye with his father and joined in the onslaught by Fuad, Philby and others on Ibn Sa’ud’s principal hench man, ’Abdullah Suleyman, in October 1931. Although ’Abdullah Suleyman had the best of this in the end, the King has continued to treat Faysal with consideration. Received many decorations during his tour in 1932, including an honorary G.B.E. In 1935 showed surprising dash as a horseman in races held at Riyadh on occasion of Sir Andreev Ryan’s visit. Reported to have married in October 1935 a daughter of his aunt Nura. Represented Sa’udi Arabia at the London discussions on Palestine in 1939, and seems to have played the part well. In the last two years or so he has acquired much more self-confidence and tries to fill his role as Foreign Minister by showing an up-to-date knowledge of events. He talks freely and intelligently in the com pany of Europeans whom he knows. He has none of his father’s picturesqueness of language, but speaks a very pure Arabic, clearly enunciated, with little trace of the Nejdi accent which all his brothers possess. On occasion he is capable of acting with firmness within the instructions given to him by the King, as was shown in the expulsion of the Italian Minister in February 1942. Visited America and England from September to December 1943 with his brother, Khalid (No. 1 (5)). The two Amirs, who were accompanied by the Shaikh Hafiz Wahba (No. 25), travelled all the way by air. On their return journey, in December 1943, visited the battlefields in North Africa. Headed the Sa’udi delegation to the San Francisco Conference in April 1945 and to the Preparatory Commission and First Assembly of the United Nations, November 1945 to January 1946. Represented his father at celebration on 17th April in Damascus of withdrawal of foreign troops from Syria and went on to pay an official visit to the Lebanon.V *; W / — He spent some time in England on his way back from San Francisco in August 1945 undergoing treatment for severe gastric ulcers and alternating dignified appearances at the Dorchester Hotel with the entertainment at a country house near Dorking, on strictly non-Wahhabi lines, of the more dubious disjecta of Mayfair. After a brief visit to Saudi Arabia, he returned to England in November 1945 until late February 1946 and now appears to have recovered from his ulcer trouble. Represented Saudi Arabia at the London Confer ence on Palestine, October 1946. At the end of the year visited Amman as the guest of King Abdullah. His Majesty’s Government had hoped and suggested that the opportunity might be taken for a friendly discussion of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier ques tion, but in the event no politics were discussed. In 1947 represented Saudi Arabia at U.N.O. meetings in the United States. Is tending increasingly to spend long periods in the United States—possibly in order to see as much as possible of a Californian girl for whom he is said to have fallen. (4) Muhammad ibn ’Abdul-’Aziz. —Born in or about 1913. Headed the Sa’iidi forces which entered Medina in 1925. Was made acting Viceroy when the Amir Faysal went abroad in 1932, but got beyond himself and was replaced by his brother Khalid. let Faysal at Kuwait on his return and shared in bout of dissipation there. Visited the United .Kingdom with the Amir Sa’ud in 1937 and 1938. Lives mostly at Riyadh, visiting the Hejaz only for the pilgrimage. Said to be popular with the tribes. Appears to be being brought gradually into his father’s counsels; was present, together with the Amir Sa’ud, at several interviews between His Majesty’s Minister and the King at Riyadh in March 1942. Visited India for health reasons in June 1943 together with Mansur No. 1 (9) and Shaikh Abdullah Suleiman (No. 11). Owing to their indiscreet and extravagant living their visit was not a success. Returned in October 1943. Accompanied his father to Egypt for the meetings with President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill in February 1945. He, together with two other joy-riding princes (Fahad and Nawwaf—see list of sons below), accompanied the Sa’udi delegation to the San Francisco Conference in April 1945. (5) Khalid ibn ’Abdul-’Aziz. —Born in or about 1916. Acted as Viceroy of the Hejaz in 1932 (see (4) ^pove). Visited the United Kingdom with the Amir Faisal in 1939. Full brother and constant companion of Amir Muhammad (4) above. Accompanied his brother Faysal when they visited America and England in the winter of 1943. (6) to (27). Sons of 20 and less in 1939 numbered twenty-two. The following is a correct list in order of age: Nasir (1920), Sad (1921), Fahad (1921), Mansur (1921), ’Abdullah (1922), Bandar (1924), Sultan (1924), Musa’id (1927), Mish’al (1927), ’Abdul-Muhsin (1928), Mushari (1932), Muteb (1933), Talal (1933), ’Abdur-Rahman (1933), Turki (1934), Badr (1934), Nawwaf (1934), Navef (1935), Fawwaz (1936), Ma’jid (1937), Sulman (1938) and (?) (1939). Mansur, No. 1 (9), deserves separate notice. His mother, a Caucasian concubine, was the King’s favourite until her death in 1938. A favourite of his father, he is perhaps alone among the King’s sons in being interested in something other than political gossip, field sports and domestic pleasures. He likes machines, personally sees to the maintenance of his cars and spends a good deal of his time at the Royal garage in Riyadh. Usually in charge of arrangements when the King moves from Riyadh to the Hejaz or to camp, and is said to be responsible for the maintenance of the electrical installation at the Royal Palace at Riyadh. Visited Egypt in March 1942 as the guest of the British Commander-in-chief. On his return to Jedda he gave an interview (with his father’s approval of his remarks) to a representa tive of the B.B.C., which was recorded in the Royal Palace at Jedda and later broadcast from London. He owns a cinema projector. Visited India, for health reasons, in June 1943 with his brother, Muhammad and ’Abdullah Suleiman. In October and again in November he visited Palestine for further medical treatment, returning with Faysal, whom he joined in Egypt, in December 1943. Appointed Minister of Defence in March 1944. Visited Khartoum in December 1944 to arrange for the training there of Sa’udi army personnel in driving and maintenance. Accompanied his father for the meetings with President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill in Egypt in February 1945. Acting Viceroy during the absence of the Amir Faysal at the San Francisco Conference, and from November 1945 to February 1946. The Amir Mansour prevailed upon Ibn Saud to ask His Majesty’s Minister to request His Majesty’s Government to provide a military mission to train the Saudi Arabian army. As the result of this request, a small military mission was established early in 1947 at Taif. the headquarters of the Saudi Arabian armed forces, where the Amir is generally in residence. Co-operation between the Amir, in his capacity of Minister of Defence, and the head of the British Military Mission has been generally very satisfactory. He is certainly very keen, but is almost completely devoid of knowledge of the organisation of his own forces. The Amir Mansour is also in charge of the State- owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, and relations with the British Civil Air Training mission at Taif will also be his responsibility. Talal, No. 1 (18).—One of the King’s favourite sons. His mother, Umm Talal, one of the royal concubines, is the King’s favourite. Talal w’ent to Egypt in August 1944, on board H.M.S. Sagitta, for medical treatment. He was found to be suffering from syphilis, and after not very successful treatment returned by air in October. Nawwaf (22), a full brother of Talal, is an animated and friendly hoy who is becoming something of a traveller. He has already visited the United King dom and Egypt, and in the summer of 1947 went to the United States with Shaikh Khairuddin al- Zureikly (q.v.) in attendance. When passing through Paris he seems to have given an interview as a result of which one evening paper came out with the headline “ Mon pere a 200 femmes.” Brothers. All Amirs. No. 28 in 1943 report, Muhammad ibn ’Abdurrah man. —Died July 1943. (28) and (29) Sa’d and Sa’ud, who died in 1916 and 1939 respectively. The former left three sons: Faysal, Sa’ud and Fahad; and the latter two: Muhammad and Faysal. (30) ’Abdullah ibn 'Abdurrahman. —Born about 1894. Accompanied King on his visit to Egypt in February 1945 for the meetings wdth President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill. (31) to (34) Ahmad, Musd’id, Sa'd and ’Abdul Muhsin. —Younger men, the children of the old age of ’Abdur-Rahman ibn Faysal. ’Ardif Branch. Also Amirs. Certain of the King’s cousins are dealt with in separate notices, but a general mention may be made of the ’Araif as being members of a senior branch of the family by virtue of descent from Sa’ud ibn Faysal, an elder brother of the King’s father and a former ruler at Riyadh. Their generic name of ’Araif is one applied to raided camels, subsequently ‘‘ recognised,” as the root implies, and recovered by their owners. It seems to have been given to them because they had remained in the hands of the Beni Rashid, but escaped to Ibn Sa’ud in the course of battle in 1904. Some of them rebelled against him in 1910, but the present members of the family form portion of the King’s posse of satellite princes.Although inconspicuous, they might produce a claimant, by right of senior descent, to the throne. Various names are given in the Almanack de Gotha and Philby’s Arabia. The most important of these princes, who bear individually the surname of al- ’Arafa, would appear to be— (35) Sa’ud ibn 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Sa'ud ibn Faysal. —Married the King’s sister Nura. Seems to play a certain role in Ibn Sa’ud s entourage. Probably the same Sa’ud al-’Arafa who was described in a report from Kuwait as being, according to a reliable informant, a friend of the ’Ajman tribe and secretly hostile to Ibn Sa’ud. Daughter reported to have married Amir Pay sal (q.v.) in October 1935. 2. 'Abdul- Aziz ibn Ibrahim. Governor of Medina (technically Acting Governor vice the King’s son Amir Khalid, who never actually held the post) until May 1936, when he was replaced by Abdullah as Sidayri (No. 50 (1)). Had the reputation of being a severe and arbitrary Governor. Was Governor of Abba in 1926 at the time of the clash between the Akhwan and the Yemeni pilgrim caravan, the ’Usba, in the Wadi Tanuma. In 1936 appointed a member of the Council of Ministers. 3. A bdul- Aziz ibn Mu ammar. Governor of Jedda until June 1935, when he was appointed Governor of Taif in the room of Amir Abdullah, maternal uncle of Amir Faysal (No. 1 (3)). Born in or about 1904. Comes of a former ruling family of Nejd, apparently the same Beni Mu’ammar of Ayaina, who were prominent in the early days of the Wahhabi movement and are mentioned several times in Philby’s Arabia. Brought up principally at Riyadh. Was Governor of Yanbu’ for some time and earned a good reputation there. Was appointed to Jedda in August 1932, with the title of Amir, on the death of Hajji ’Abdullah ’Ali Riza, a leading local mer chant who had been governor with the old title of Qaimmaqam since King Huseyn’s time. He is good- looking and pleasant, but pretentious, probably on the score of his blue blood. He was keen on riding and other forms of sport until afflicted by paralysis in 1939. He went to India for special treatment in March 1941, but returned incurable in October 1941. Now completely deaf and unable to walk. 4. A bdul-'Aziz ibn Musa'id ibn Jiluwi ibn Sa'ud. Second cousin to the King. Governor of Hail since 1925 or earlier. Said by the Sheykh of Kuwait in March 1932 to be only 40, but to have aged greatly owing to worry. Was much in evidence in 1929 as one of the King’s right-hand men at the time of the Akhwan rebellion. Came into prominence in February 1930, when, apparently without the King’s authority, he conducted a raid on the scale of a punitive expedition, which it was, in fact, intended to be, into Transjordan. Disavowed by the King at the time, but maintained in his governorate. Was in November 1932 put at the head of the principal force despatched to reduce the ’Asir rebels, and proceeded from Riyadh to ’Abha and Jizan, where he assumed supreme command of the forces in ’Asir. Said then to be intended for the Governorate-General of the w r ho!e ’Asir area, but eventually returned to Hail. A man for occasions requiring drastic action. Appointed inspector of the frontier area on the Sa’udi-Iraq frontier in 1936, duties he combines with those of Governor of Hail. In 1939 was said to have aroused suspicion at Riyadh as having designs on the throne which he might try to carry out on the death of Ibn Saud. 5. 'Abdul-'Aziz (ibn Hamud) ibn Zeyd. Inspector of Bedouin in Transjordan frontier area Born probably about 1897. Comes of a Hail family said to be related to the Beni Rashid. Said to have been educated in Constantinople. Sent to ’Amman in summer of 1926 to discuss claims in respect of raids, and attended with two other Sa’udi delegates an abortive conference at Ma’an in September. Was one of the two Sa’udi delegates on tribunal which sat at Jericho from February to May 1927 in accordance with the Hadda Agreement. Was later an Assistant Governor of Jedda. Sent to ’Amman in August 1930 as Sa’udi agent at the MacDonnell investigation regarding raids. Appointed Inspector of Beduin in the frontier region in January 1931, and held meetings at long intervals with Captain Glubb, his opposite number in Transjordan. Personally amiable, but will take no responsibility without reference to the King. From 1936 to 1938 was inspector of the whole Transjordan-Saudi frontier, under a scheme for dividing the northern frontier area into three sectors under inspectors with wide powers. In May 1943 was appointed Saudi Consul at Damascus in succession to Rusheyd Pasha. 6. 'A bdullah ibn Blayhid. A leading figure among the Wahhabi Ulema. Comes from Hail. Qadhi of Mecca after its occupa tion by Ibn Sa’iid, and was described in Eldon Rutter’s account of him (1925—26) as a “ bent and wizened little man.” Appointed Grand Qadhi of tl^ Hejaz in January 1926. Was instrumental in 1926 in obtaining a fatwa from seventeen Ulama Of Medina in support of the Wahhabi policy of destroying tombs. Head of the Nejdi delegates at the Moslem Congress of June 1926. Again visited Medina in November of that year in attendance on the King and in the company of ’Abdullah ibn Hasan (see 12 (1)), bent on purging the place of iniquity as Mecca had been purged. Vacated post at Mecca in 1928 and returned to Hail. Was thought at that time to favour the extremists of the Akhwan move ment. Still visits Mecca at intervals. Thought to be embarrassing in high places owing to his frankness and fanaticism. Signed the pronouncement by the Ulama of Nejd in favour of Jihad at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932. 7. A bdullah Kdzim. A Hejazi said to be of Cossack origin. Born about 1887. Was employed in the Mecca Post Office in King Hussein’s time. Appointed Sa’udi Director^ General of Posts and Telegraphs in 1926 and stP^ _ holds the post. Went to Port Sudan in March 192b as one of Ibn Sa’ud’s delegates to negotiate about the E.T.C. cable and showed himself an obstructive negotiator. Was again pretty sticky in taking delivery of Marconi wireless in 1931-33, but created a good impression at the time of the cable and wireless negotiations in the spring of 1935. 8. 'Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn ’Aqil (or 'A qeyil). In 1926 Governor of Jauf. but had vacated the post by March 1928. when he was put in command of a force sent to quell the disturbance created at Wejh by Hamid ibn Rifada. Probably identical with the ibn ’Aqil who was mentioned in May 1931 as a possible candidate for the governorship of Tebuk. but w T as not appointed. ’Abdullah ibn ’Aqil commanded the Ikhwan mobilised in June 1932 to repress the further rebellion of Hamid ibn Rifada. 9. 'Abdullah ibn Muhammad, al-Fadhl. Vice-President of the Legislative Council and Assistant Viceroy. Probably born about 1883. Principal member of the Fadhl family q.v. Was formerly a merchant in Jedda. Described in 1917 as ” anti-Sherif and pro-English ” and as goinsr by the sobriquet of ” Englisi ” in Jedda. Put in prison at that time in Mecca for some unknown offence.JPIayed no particular role subsequently (and was so little valued for brain-power as to be known as “ the Sheep ”) until ex-King ’Ali sent him on a delegation to negotiate with Ibn Sa’ud at Mecca. Went over definitely to Ibn Sa’ud and acted as his representa tive at Kabigh for the 1925 pilgrimage, in which employment he is said to have feathered his nest. Attached to the King’s son, Muhammad, as adviser when the young Amir occupied Medina later in 1925. Figured as a Hejazi delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. Obtained about the same . period, in partnership with Indians settled in Mecca, a contract for motor transport, but lost it. Did better as purveyor to the Government. Sent on an unsuccessful mission to Eritrea in 1927 in connexion * with negotiations for the recognition of Ibn Sa’ud bj Italy and proposed treaty arrangements. Also had some part in the treaty negotiations with Great Britain. Became assistant to the Viceroy at Mecca and so on to appointment to his present post in or before 1929. Went in that year on a mission to Persia. Alleged in the same year to have done nicely in the company of ’Abdullah Suleyman by cornering bezine, &amp;c., just before new duties were imposed. Appears to enjoy the King’s confidence in a high degree and to steer an even or waggly course between rival factions. Not impressive in appearance or con versation; still somewhat of a sheep; but wears his recent dignities with an acquired air of dignity, ^§c^)riety and sagacity, which may be a part • of his success. May still have commercial interests, but has long been dissociated from the business of the other Fadhls. Acting Viceroy during Faisal’s absence in 1939 and again during Faisal’s absence in the winter of 1943. 10. ’Abdullah an Nafisi. , Important as being Ibn Sa’ud’s agent at Kuwait, where he is established as a merchant and once did a large business in rice, &amp;c. Now elderly and less active. Seems sensible. 11. 'Abdullah ibn Suleyman al Hamddn. Minister of Finance. Born about 1887. Of plebeian ’Aneyza origin. Started life in a small way with the Qusaibis, originally, it is said, as a coffee boy. Spent ten years as clerk in their Bombay office. Returned to Nejd about 1919. Said to have gone bankrupt as a broker. Recommended by the Ousaibis to replace his brother, who had died, as a ^|rk in the King’s Diwan. Rose to be head of the *** Lmvan. Became Director-General of Finance and had acquired complete control of all financial matters by September 1928, when it w r as remarked that he travelled in greater state than the King himself between Mecca and Jedda. Has since been the most powerful of the King’s advisers. His position was strongly assailed in October 1931 by a cabal, which included the Amir Faysal, Fuad Hamza, ’Abdullah al Fadhl (perhaps a doubtful enemy) and Mr. Philby. Was sent for a time to lend a hand with the Tawil mission in Hasa, but had his place kept warm for him and returned to it. Was promoted in August 1932 from being Director-General of Finance to the post of Minister of Finance for the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies, thus obtaining the title of Wazir, hitherto enjoyed only by the Amir Faysal. fontinues to be supreme in the financial administra tion and has his finger in many other pies, being in effect Comptroller of the Privy Purse, Grand Master of Ordnance, Quarter-Master-General on occasion, general manager of the King’s establishment of slaves and pilgrimage-organiser. Appointed in 1935 to the specific additional post of Deputy Minister of Defence. Probably entirely faithful to the King, whose needs he supplies at the expense of others having demands on the Treasury, and who gives him a free hand in finance regardless of the effect on public opinion. A man of rather mean appearance, but emphatically a “ live wire.” Ready and energetic in conversation and full of ideas about development. Has spent long periods at J edda acting as the representative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The main burden of dealing with the Italian Minister’s procrastinations and evasions in January and February 1942 fell on him and he acquitted himself very creditably. He was the originator of the agricultural development scheme at Al Kharj and show'ed great energy and enthusiasm in the face of much hostility, envy and ill-natured criticism from his brother advisers. A keen fisherman and a tireless traveller, his other pleasures include tobacco, and the bottle. He has a good sense of humour and repartee sharpened in many verbal battles with his rivals. His position was weakened somewhat by the dismissal in April 1944 of his friend and prot^g£ Najib Salha (No. 69) whose pro-American enthusiasm he is thought to share. Was a very harassed and worried man during 1944 when faced with the prospect of having to reorganise the country’s finances and economy on sounder lines. Accompanied the King to Egypt in February 1945 for the meetings with President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill. Is cultivated by the Americans whose increasing tendency to play the role of Lady Bountiful to Saudi Arabia naturally appeals to him as Minister of Finance. The abuse of his official position by his brother Hamad, and the latter’s sons, is gross and scandalous. . In August 1946 visited the United States, accompanied by a rabble of official and unofficial hangers-on, for the purpose of negotiating a loan to be used for purchase in the United States of essen tial supplies and rehabilitation equipment. A 10 million dollar line of credit for these purposes was granted by the Export-Import Bank, secured by an assignment of royalties due from the oil company. It seems that the Minister and his entourage took the opportunity afforded by* their presence in America to make a large number of purchases on private account. 12. Abdul-Wahhdb, Descendants of. The following seem to be the most notable of the descendants of the founder of Wahhabism: — (1) 'Abdullah ibn Hasan. —Is one of the leading Wahhabi Ulema in Mecca. Played a role in 1926, with ’Abdullah ibn Blayhid (q.v.), in the Wahhabi purging of the Holy Cities, and was in 1929 thought, like him, to favour the Ikhwan extremists. Signed the pronouncement of the Ulama in favour of Jihad at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932. Now Grand Qadhi. Proud and fanatical. Known as ” Shaikh al-Islam,” he is thought to exercise considerable influence over Ibn Saud in religious and non-religious matters. (2) Muhammad ibn ’Abdul-'Aziz ibn Sheykh, nicknamed as-Sahabi, formerly Governor of Taif, transferred to Riyadh in 1932 as Assistant to the Amir Sa’ud. (3) ’Abdul-Latif Family. —Four sons and a probable grandson of a descendant named ’Abdul- Latif were among the ten signatories of the declara tion of Jihad referred to under (1). No. (2) and the mother of the Amir Faysal (q.v.) also probably belong to this connexion. 13. 'Abdul-Wahhdb Abu Malha. A personage of consequence in ’Asir, possibly of the Sheykhly family of Malha near Sabya, although this cannot be affirmed. W^as described in 1927 as Director of Finance in ’Asir, and was in that year one of four delegates sent by Ibn Sa’ud to negotiate with the Imam Yahya. Probably still has the title of Director of Finance and commanded the Sa’fidi forces which entered Sabya in November 1932. 14. 'Abdur-Rauf as-Sabbdn. Born in the Hejaz probably between 1888 and 1393. Grandson of an immigrant from Egypt.Educated in the Hejaz and in Egypt. Associated with his father, Hasan, and others in what was in 1917 the principal hide and skin business in Jedda and Mecca. Impressed the Hejazis at that time by his knowledge and European manners. Was made Director of Education in Jedda, but was dismissed and reverted to trade in cotton goods and skins. Edited in 1925 the anti-Sa’udi paper Al-Umma in Cairo with the help of one of the Dabbaghs. Given a post by the Amir ’Abdullah as manager of his estates in Transjordan in or before 1931. Was an active supporter of the Hizb-al-Ahrar-al-Hijazi, and was concerned in 1932 in the press propaganda and financial arrangements of the outside promoters of movements against Ibn Sa’ud. Seems to have gone at least once to Eritrea in this connexion. Was dismissed by the Amir ’Abdullah in the autumn of 1932 as a result of these political activities, but went on with them. Excluded from Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan, whereupon he retired to Bagdad, where he was understood to have become a private secre tary to the late ex-King Ali. Returned to the Hejaz with or at the same time as Ahmad-al-Mujallid in July 1935, and was appointed in 1936 a member of the Legislative Council. In 1938 did some propa ganda for Ibn Saud in Egypt. Appointed Director- General of Waqfs in December 1942 in succession to Seyyid Abdul-Wahhab. Appointed president of the Mecca Municipality in November 1945. 15. Muhammad Sa’id al Kurdi. Formerly Director of Police in Jedda. Of Kurdish origin, from Zakho. Was previously Director of Police at Rabigh and gave offence to the legation by trying to commandeer a car which was taking the Nawab of Bahawalpur to Medina. Was transferred to Jedda in 1932 and confirmed in the post early in 1933. Was removed from his post in Jedda and apparently reappointed to Rabigh in 1933. Officer Commanding troops in Jedda in 1936, in which capacity he was in charge of aviation during the presence of the Italian Air Mission 1937-39. According to a Russian pilot, showed ability and a real desire to learn about aviation. Was cultivated assiduously by the Italian pilot, probably received bribes from him, and learned Italian. Very anti- British when the Palestine trouble w T as at its height. 16. 'Ahdur-Rahman al-Bassdm. Formerly Second Assistant in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Educated in Egypt. Speaks English. Helped Sheikh Yusuf Yasin with the English versions of the Sa’udi-Koweit Agreements signed at Jedda in April 1942. 17. AU Taha. Assistant Governor of Jedda since 1928. A Hejazi born about 1894. Rose from a small post as secre tary to the Governor. Cadaverous and unhealthy. Speaks Turkish well. Well meaning, and not with out intelligence. Acted as Deputy Governor of Jedda from April 1944 and showed himself helpful and co-operative over routine matters with His Majesty’s Legation. Has a working knowledge of French. Reverted to his former post of Assistant Governor on the appointment in April 1945 of a new Governor, Abdurrahman Sidayri (q.v.). 18. Bujdd (or Humayd) Family. A leading family in the notoriously fanatical Ghutghut section of the ’Ateyba tribe. For an account of individual members of the family see Personalities Report for 1946. 19. Dahhdgh Family. A Mecca family of “ Moorish ” (t.e., some North- West Africa) origin. Appear to be Seyyids. Became prominent in 1932 in connexion with plot behind the revolt of Ibn Rifadah and the prepara tions for the retarded revolt in ’Asir. The family is numerous. For an account of individual members of the family see Personalities Report for 1946. 20. Dawish Family. A leading family in the Mutayr tribe. Its best- known member, Faysal ad-Dawish, famous as a raider, as one of Ibn Sa’ud’s principal lieutenants and as a rebel against him, died as a State prisoner , at Riyadh in October 1931. His name is, however, still potent in Eastern Arabia, where he was regarded as more than an ordinary sheykh—a kingly man and a king maker. This gives importance to his * sons, two of whom have figured in reports from Kuwait. (1) Bandar ibn Faysal ad-Dawish .—Said to be looked to by the Mutayr as the leader they desire, but to be himself very cautious and unwilling to move at present. Reported in December 1932 to have countered a question by Ibn Sa’ud as to whom the Mutayr wanted for a leader by saying “ No one but Your Majesty.” (2) Al-Humaydi ibn Faysal ad Dawish .—Visited Ibn Sa’ud at Riyadh in the autumn of 1932, when the King was making efforts to reconcile the ex-rebel Mutayr and ’Ajman, still hostile to him, and was well received and rewarded. The ladies of this family seem to count. Tne political agent at Kuwait, who had befriended them when Faysal was surrendered to Ibn Sa’ud in January 1930, was visited by various of them on several occasions in 1932. They included Faysal’s mother, who hid bitter hatred of the King beneath copious praises; a sister, whose rumoured marriage to a Harb Sheykh was regarded as an augury of reconciliation between his tribe and the Mutayr, but was afterwards denied; and a cousin, still a woman of considerable charm and humour, who had been married to Sheykh Mubarak of Kuwait, to a deceased son of Faysal ad-Dawish and, lastly, as prize of war, to Ibn Sa’ud’s brother ’Abdullah. 21. Fadhl (al-Fazal) Family. Nejdis of Aneyza origin long settled in the Hejaz. An original ’Abdullah had at least five sons, all now deceased, with one possible exception. Each of these had issue. Members of the first and second genera^ tions after the original ’Abdullah were concerned ' firms doing important business in the Hejaz and India, where they had a high reputation, enhanced by their position as business agents of Tbn Sa’ud, until 1930. Family differences and bad trade led to the collapse of their business at Bombay and Karachi in that year. The two partners most actively concerned in the business in India absconded to the Hejaz, where a third tried to dissociate himself from the partnership. The affairs of the family have for some years been the subject of very complicated litigation and have engaged the attention of various British authorities for reasons too long to recapitu late. The family still have influential connexions in the Hejaz, and several members of it have been given employment by Ibn Sa’ud. Apart from ’Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn ’Abdullah, who is the subject of a separate notice, the following deserve mention : — (1) Muhammad, son of the ’Abdullah just men tioned. In business in Jedda and did a tidy trade in grain. Disinherited by his father in 1943 as a result of a quarrel. Died in 1946. (2) Ibrahim ibn Abdurrahman. —One of the two who absconded from India in 1930. Appointed a member of the Legislative Council in October 1930. Became later a secretary to the Amir Faysal. Was called on to resign, ostensibly on grounds of ill-health, by Amir Faysal. He is now living in Mecca and engaged in trade in an unimportant way; but is still said to enjoy the confidence of Amir Faysal.9 (3) Muhammad ibn Abdurrahman ibn’Abdullah .— Was a partner in the firm which collapsed in India in 1930, but resided in Jedda and tried to dissociate himself from the other partners, his brother and cousin. (4) ’Abdullah ibn Ibrahim ibn ’Abdullah .—Private secretary to the Amir Fay sal in 1926. Afterwards one of the partners who absconded from India. Selected in 1931 for the post of chargd d’affaires in Holland, under scheme which did not materialise for having a legation there with the Sa’udi Minister in . London as minister. Appointed Treasurer to the Government later in 1931, as a result of the cabal against ’Abdullah Suleyman. Later became Director of Finance in Jedda, then Government representa tive to the Arabian-American Oil Company at Dhahran and Sa’udi representative for supply matters in Bahrein. Speaks English. Appointed member of the Council of Ministers in February 1946. (5) Ibrahim ibn Suleyman al ’Aqil. —Son-in-law of father of (4), and has taken the place of (2) as Rais-ul-Diwan of the Amir Faysal. Is an impor tant official and enjoys Amir Faysal’s complete confidence. Accompanied him to London in 1939 for the Palestine discussions. As a young man spent considerable time in India. Speaks a very little English and some Urdu. A man of culture and pleasing manners. Accompanied the Amir Faysal San Francisco Conference in April 1945. Has oeen suggested as a possible minister in London; but for some reason Ibn Saud does not like him. 22. Fahad ibn Zu ayr. Late Governor of ’Asir. Was head of the mission sent to ’Asir in May 1930 to make the arrangements which subsequently culminated in its practical annexation by Ibn Sa’ud. Was later appointed Amir, though probably not the first to hold the post. Reported to Ibn Sa’ud with increasing urgency in the autumn of 1932 that the Idrisi was getting beyond himself. The Idrisi, professing complete loyalty to the King, complained bitterly of Fahad’s rough treatment. The King, anxious to placate the Idrisi, steered a middle course and sent a commis sion to investigate. Before it could reach the spot the Idrisi had gone into open revolt and Fahad had to escape from his seat of government at Jizan. Was little heard of for some time afterwards, but was ijP^ointed Governor of Qunfida in or about June 1933. 23. Fawzan as-Sabiq. Formerly Sa’udi Charge d'Affaires in Egypt and consul-general in Cairo. Appointed in August 1936 upon the conclusion of the Sa’udi-Egyptian Treaty of May 1936. Previously Sa’udi agent in Egypt. Born about 1888. Belongs by origin to the ’Uqeyl, the guild, as it were, of recognised caravan-guides. Educated in a Turkish school at ’ Amman. Said to have lived for many years in Bombay. Is by pro fession a dealer in camels and horses and still appears to do this business. Was Ibn Sa’ud’s agent in Damascus before 1924. Is described by Sir Walter Smart as a devout Moslem, plain, slow, courteous and old-fashioned; politically rather innocent, but possessed of a certain native shrewd ness. He is never used by Ibn Saud for important political work. A keen race-goer who spends much of his time at the races in Cairo and Alexandria. Promoted to rank of minister in January 1946 during Ibn Sand’s visit to Egypt. During the last years of his mission became quite deaf and probably rather feeble-minded. 24. Fuad Bey Hamza. Born about 1900, he is a Druze of Abeih, in the Lebanon, where the family are less prosperoi&gt;s than they were. One brother Sa id was accused of com plicity in the murder of a Christian priest at Abeih in 1930, but was finally acquitted in April—May 1934. Educated in Turkish schools in Syria, the Teachers’ Training College, Beirut, and the Syrian Protestant College, Beirut. Was Inspector of Schools at Damascus for a time. Obtained a post as clerk under the Palestine Department of Public Health in 1921. Resigned after a few months and took service under the Department of Education as a teacher in Acre. Transferred in 1922 to a secondary school in Jerusalem as teacher in English and remained until 1926. Studied simultaneously at the Law School, got a certificate of Legal Studies in 1925 and qualified in five subjects, including Consti tutional History and Public International Law, for the Diploma, but did not complete the course. Had a uniformly good record in Palestine, but was mixed up in politics and the Druze insurrectionary move ment. May have feared arrest, although he was not, in fact, in danger of it. Left for Egypt on the 2nd December, 1926. Apparently was to go to India on a Syro-Palestinian delegation, but w T as drawn to the Hejaz, where, after giving English lessons for a time, he was taken into the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by Yusuf Yasin, then acting for Dr. ’Abdullah Damluji. Became Acting Minister in July 1928, when Dr. Damluji left on a mission, never to return Had probably worked earlier to undermine Damluji’s position. Remained Acting Minister until the Amir Faysal became titular Minister with Fuad as Under secretary, but still effective head of the Ministry in December 1930. Retained his post, with a seat on the Council of Ministers when the latter was con stituted early in 1932. Visited Europe for the first time as a member of the Sa’udi Mission under the Amir Faysal in the spring of 1932 and did all the real business. Was made an honorary K.B.E. during the visit to London, and for several years carried a pass port in which he and his wife appeared as Sir Fuad and Lady Hamza. Visited Europe again in 1934 and 1935 and conducted important negotiations with the Foreign Office, and in 1939 went to London with the Amir Faysal and took a prominent part in the Palestine discussions. Fuad Hamza is alert, intelligent, well informed on matters pertaining to his work and industrious. Speaks English well and Turkish and some French. Equally devoted to his own ambitions and to the cause of Arab nationalism, serving Ibn Sa’ud as its exponent, though inclined sometimes to despair of the system of which he has made himself part. Keeps in touch with other Nationalists in Palestine, and probably Syria. Very hostile to ’Abdullah Suleyman and took part in the unsuccessful drive against him in 1931. Is a very poor Moslem, and conforms to Wahabism no more than he is obliged to. Would like to see Sa’udi Arabia, a name of which he was one of the authors, develop on modern, more or less constitutional lines. Rather bumptious and sometimes difficult to deal with, but responds to personal handling. His attitude towards foreign Powers is determined by Arab nationalism, and if, as there is some ground to believe, he accepted a large bribe from the Italians at the time of the Ethiopian w r ar, it does not follow that this affected his advice to Ibn Sa’ud. Possesses a splendid villa in the best part of Beirut which could not have been built out of legitimate savings, even supplemented by a sum of £3,000 which Ibn Saud is said to have contributed to this object. In 1939 was appointed first Sa’udi Minister to Paris. Removed to Vichy after the collapse of France in 1940, where his record was not reassuring. Withdrawn from there and appointed first Sa’udi Minister in Angora where he proceeded in April 1943. The King did not want him to return to Sa’udi Arabia, and the great power he once wielded passed entirely into the hands of his rival, Yusuf Yasin. 3490110 Incurred the King’s displeasure by intrigues and attempts at mediating between the French and the Syrians and the latter and the Lebanese when on a visit to the Lebanon during the troubles in Novem ber 1943. Was permitted to return to Sa’udi Arabia in April 1944 and was present at most of the inter views between His Majesty’s Minister and Ibn Sa’ud in April and May. Left for Angora again in the autumn of 1944 but lingered on in Beirut on the way and meddled in the abortive Franco-Syrian negotia tions early in 1945, before returning to Turkey. After a brief visit to Saudi Arabia in the autumn of 1945, he left again for urgent medical treatment (heart trouble), lleturned, rather unwillingly, in April 1946 and has since completely re-established himself in the King’s confidence as His Majesty’s adviser on foreign affairs, in Riyadh. Ibn Saud twice went out of his way to assure His Majesty’s Minister in May and June 1946 that Fuad Hamza is an able and much-maligned man. In 1947 was appointed Minister of State with the duty of regularising the Saudi Arabian Government’s relations with the concessionary companies and the contractors engaged upon the various public utility projects. He seemed to set about his new duties energetically and with an uncompromisingly legalistic approach to all matters in dispute but after a month or two he vanished, apparently to Beirut. It is not clear whether or not this appointment is to be held concurrently with that of minister to Turkey, whence he seems never to have been recalled. In his new capacity, his relations with Abdullah Sulaiman (q-v.) are inevitably difficult, and likely to remain so. 25. Hafiz (Hdfidh) Wahba. Sa’udi Minister in London. An Egyptian born probably between 1885 and 1890. Educated at Al-Azhar. Mixed up in Nationalist and pan-Islamic politics in early manhood and was closely associated with Abdul-’Aziz Shawish. Definitely anFi-British at time of Great War and said to have been deported from India. Said to have been in Bahrein at one time. Started a school at Kuwait and passed thence in Ibn Sa’ud’s service. Became tutor to the Amir Fay sal and accompanied the prince to London in 1919. Was one of Ibn Sa’ud’s delegates at the abortive Kuwait Conference in 1923-24. In supreme charge of the civil side of the Administration at Mecca in 1925, with a viceregal title, and did well. Read the King’s inaugural address at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. Much employed on missions and negotiations during the ensuing years. Inter alia took part in negotiations with Sir G. Clayton in 1925, 1927 and 1928 and expounded Ibn Sa’ud’s views and fears regarding Italian policy in the Red Sea, Bolshevik activity and Hashimite sovereignty in neighbouring countries to the Residency at Cairo early in 1928. During all this period waged a ding-dong struggle against the Syrian influences around the King, and had ups and downs. Was occulted towards the end of 1926, but returned to favour soon after and became Assistant Viceroy beside the Amir Faysal. Thought to have indisposed the Amir by his masterfulness as a tutor and his disregard as Assistant Viceroy for the Amir’s position. Relegated in July 1928 to the post of Director-General of Education. Went to London in 1929 to represent Ibn Sa’ud at the International Postal Congress. While there was selected for the post of Minister in London, but did not take up the post for over a year, during which interval he went on a sort of undefined mission to Kuwait and was also employed much about the King’s person, though he appeared on the whole to have lost ground to the Syrians. He and Fuad Hamza are deadly enemies. Has during bis tenure of the legation in London represented his country on international occasions, at Geneva and elsewhere. Was designated in 1931 to be Minister at The Hague, but the arrangements have never materialised for reasons of economy. Represented Sa’udi Arabia at the opening of the Tokyo mosque in 1938. Hafiz Wahba has sown his political wild oats. His anti-British sentiments are supposed to have under gone a change in or before 1928, when he was reported as being accustomed to say that, as regards Egypt, he would always be against Great Britain, but, as a servant of Ibn Sa’ud, believed the King’s interest to lie in friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government. He has certainly shown himself -well- disposed in London, and has been distinctly helpful. » He is a good propagandist for Ibn Sa’ud on the lecture platform and in society. Neither taciturn nor talkative, he appeals by his sense of humour and looks anything but a Wahhabi (except that he abstains from alcohol and tobacco) at the Hyde Park Hotel or the Savoy. Likes the theatre too, and alleged to have a passion for night clubs to which he gave full rein in New York in 1938. Speaks moderate English, but is not fluent. A useful servant to the King, whose respect and confidence he commands. He was on leave in Sa’udi Arabia early in 1940 and returned via Koweit, where he settled with the Political Agent the temporary form of the Sa’udi- Koweit Agreements, which were then brought into force pending the drawing up and signing of the final texts. Accompanied the Amirs Faisal and Khalid on their visit to America and England in the wintej^H 1943. He returned w r ith them to Sa’udi Arabi^^^* December 1943 and was present at most of the inter views between His Majesty’s Minister and the King in March and April 1944. Showed himself genuinely concerned at state of country’s finances and general corruption of Sa’udi officials. The King appeared to consider him as one of his most trustworthy coun sellors. He returned to England in April 1944. Visited the King again in January 1945 and accompanied him to Egypt in February for the meetings with President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill. Was a member of the Sa’udi delegation which attended the San Francisco Conference in April 1945. Was Assistant Saudi delegate to Preparatory Commission and First Assembly of United Nations. Made a K.C.V.O., 10th May, 1946. 26. Hamad Suleyman. Under-Secretary of State for Finance, brother of ’Abdullah Suleyman, q.v., and has worked under him. Once a petty trader in Bahrein and fled country to evade payment of debts. Acted for brother as Director-General of Finance during hK relegation to Hasa towards the end of 1931. Was appointed Wakil or Under-Secretary when Abdullah was made Wazir or full Minister in August 1932. Has been employed on missions in ’Asir, notably in November 1932, when he was sent with Khalid-al- Qarqani to investigate the differences between the Idrisi and Ibn Sa’ud’s Governor. They were too late to reach the spot before the Idrisi went into open revolt. Went with a Sa’udi mission to the Yemen in 1933, and was reported to have been detained by the Imam at San’a on the situation with Sa’udi Arabia deteriorating. Returned well before the outbreak of hostilities in 1934. In 1935 was a member of Sa’udi delegation which visited Bahrein, to negotiate the Transit Dues Agreement, and to Kuwait, to dis cuss the question of the Sa’udi blockade of t neighbouring State. Whilst at Bahrein he was-^ued by a local Persian merchant, the political agent reported, for an old debt. Fell into disgrace with Ibn Sa’ud in the spring of 1936 (as he had done at least once previously) but was apparently begged off by his brother ’Abdullah. Of even meaner appearance than his brother, a poor talker and not, apparently, very intelligent. He disclosed to His Majesty’s Minister at Taif in 1942 that his favourite outdoor sport was throwing stones. His eldest son, Suleyman-al-Hamad, born about 1917, takes some part in public affairs : he was for a time director11 of the agricultural project at Al-Kharj, and early in 1943 he went to Egypt to buy machinery and spare parts for the Minister of Finance; Suleyman repre sented Shaikh Yusuf Yasin as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs during the latter’s absence in October and November 1943. Visited Egypt again from May to July 1944, ostensibly on Government business, but managed to find time to indulge in lavish personal expenditure on the Government’s account. He is a shallow, self-seeking man. • 27. Hamdi Bey. Formerly Director-General of Military Organisa tion. Born about 1892 to 1896. Believed to be an A ’Iraqi Kurd and to have risen to non-commissioned rank in the Turkish army. Was a colonel in the army of King Huseyn, but passed to the service of lt)n Sa’iid and was officer commanding troops at Yanbu’ before 1928. Became officer commanding in Jedda in that year. Appointed Director-General of Military Organisation in 1931 in succession to Fawzi Bey Kawokji. Hamdi seems to be a man of indifferent character, with a gift for intrigue, which he displayed in connexion with the vicissitudes of the British staff of the Hejaz air force in 1931-32. Now insignificant, having ceased to hold any important military position and to be confined to duties as A.D.C. to the Amir Faysal. Stated in 1939 that he had resigned and wanted to return to Iraq, ^K^iwasnot allowed by Ibn Saud to leave the country. Boon companion of the Amir Faysal’s Albanian step-father-in-law, Ibrahim Adham. In spite of a gorgeous uniform gives an impression of seediness and has been known to touch a member of the legation for a loan of 2 riyals. 28. Seyyid Hamza al Ghauth al Madani. At one time consul-general designate for Java. Became first Sa’udi Minister to Bagdad 1938. A Hejazi of Medina, born perhaps 1895. Said to have , been educated in Turkish schools and to have frequented Turkish society. Sided with Turks at time of Arab revolt, and edited an anti-Huseyn paper at Medina in their interest. Continued to be anti- Huseyn after the success of the revolt and fled. Said to have been sentenced to death by default during his absence. Seems, nevertheless, to have been given an important post at Damascus, which he continued to hold under King Faisal’s regime there, even after King Huseyn had launched against him ,^(accusation, probably trumped up, of having stolen valuables from the Prophet’s Tomb. Was in Ibn Sa’ud’s service by end of 1923 and was one of his delegates at the abortive Kuwait Conference of 1923-24, an appointment which led to a revival by the ’Iraqi delegates of the robbery charge. Became Assistant Governor of Medina after its occupation by Sa’udi forces in 1925. Was later employed in the Palace. Selected in 1931 for the proposed consulate- general at Batavia, to the creation of which the Netherlands Government agreed, but which has never been opened, probably owing to financial difficulties. Filled in time as a member of the Legislative Council, whence he was transferred to the Amir Sa’ud’s Diwan in September 1932. Came in King’s train to Mecca in March 1933. Much of a palace man evidently. Fell into disfavour during his ^ visit to Medina in 1941, but was later pardoned and reinstated in the King’s entourage, and is now frequently present at meetings of the “ cabinet.” 29. Hithlayn Family. People of importance in the ’Ajman tribe, much concerned in the Nejd revolt of 1929. Its principal member, Dhaydan ibn Hithlayn, was slain treacherously in April of that year. For an account of individual members of the family see Personalities Report for 1946. 30. Huseyn aVAwayni (or Aoueiini). A Syrian merchant established in Jedda. An enterprising fellow, who derives some importance from being a friend of Fuad Hamza and Yusuf Yasin and having connexions in Manchester; notably with another Syrian, ’Abdul-Ghani Ydlibi, the naturalised British head of a small company there. This associa tion was closed early in 1932, when Ydlibi visited Jedda in order to work up business and with great ideas of getting concessions of all sorts. They claimed to have important support in Lancashire, specifically that of the Calico Printers’ Association (Limited). It was understood in 1932 that ’Awayni was leaving Jedda for good, but he still returns occasionally. In February or March 1933 he went to Riyadh on behalf of certain merchants to try and dissuade the King from proceeding with the conces sion to the ex-Khedive’s group for the creation of a national bank. A man likely to have ups and downs of fortune in dealing with whom commercially great jare should be used. Closely associated in business with Najib Salha and Ibrahim Shaker {qv.). Spends most of his time in Beirut, where he is said to act as Ibn Sa’ud’s semi-official purchasing agent. Although nothing has yet been proved against him, the British security authorities regarded him for a long time as suspect and only reluctantly agreed to his return to the Lebanon. Visited Ibn Sa’iid in February 1944 and returned to Beirut in April. Ibn Sa’ud wished to appoint him first Sa’udi Minister in Beirut, but later agreed with His Majesty’s Government that his appoint ment would be unsuitable. 31. M. Huseyn Nasif. Awell-known Hejazi of Jedda of Egyptian origin. Born about 1882. Inherited much property from his father, ’Omar Nasif, who was a notable personage in Turkish times, as well as the agency in Jedda of the Sherifs of the ’Abadilah branch. Occupies the largest house in Jedda and was once very properous, but is now probably less so. Was said in 1917 to have lost favour with King Huseyn, who had previously been accustomed to stay with him when in Jedda. Was said also to be desirous of British naturalisation at that time. Described as having been a Wahhabi by conviction, even before the Sa’udi invasion. Deported to ’Aqaba during King ’Ali’s short reign. Figured as a Hejazi delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. Was given the privilege of putting Ibn Sa’ud up during the years following the fall of Jedda. Has not held office, as was expected, under the Sa’udi regime, perhaps owing to doubt as to his trust worthiness. Rather a dark horse nowadays and may both dislike and be disliked by the regime, but keeps quiet. Said to be a good Arabic scholar and possesses what passes in Jedda for a remarkable library. An aldermanic figure. His eldest son, Husain Nasif, has written a book on the history of the Hejaz and has held the post of Director of Waqfs, Jedda, which he has now relinquished in order to become a director of the Arab Car Com pany. He is a nasty piece of work. A cousin, M. Salih Nasif, was the figurehead president of the Palestine Defence Committee in Mecca in 1937-38. 32. Ibrahim al Mu ammar. t QaTmmaqam of Jedda 1937. Identical with the Ibrahim al Junaifi mentioned in The Heart of Arabia and, according to the author, Mr. Philby, has a very doubtful claim to the historic name of Mu’ammar, which he subsequently assumed. In early life travelled much in India, Persia Egypt and elsewhere in the East, as trader and probably also as journalist and propagandist. About 1926 became head of Ibn Sa’ud’s diwan; transferred to that of the Amir Sa’ud in 1932. In 1933 w’as appointed Charge 34901 c 2 ■ '12 d’Affaires at Bagdad. His alleged undiplomatic activities were the subject of complaint on several occasions, and in 1987 necessitated his removal. An active, able man, interested in world affairs and with a great sense of humour. Improved Jedda con siderably, was useful in pilgrimage matters, and was helpful to foreigners within the limits of his powers. At one time was the principal channel of communica tion between the legation and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His eldest son, Abdullah, born about 1920, formerly served under Yusuf Yasin in the Political Bureau at Riyadh and has now (May 1943) been appointed first secretary at the Sa udi Legation in Bagdad. Another son, ’Abdul ’Aziz, born about 1923, formerly a student at the American University of Beirut, now acts as interpreter for Ibn Sa’ud. A hearty rogue, he was dismissed in April 1944 as a result of a scandal connected with a slave-girl and his unblushing peculation of Government stores and smuggling activities. 33. Ibrahim Shaker. Born about 1903 in the Hejaz of Turkish-Syrian parents. Was employed as chief clerk in the Jedda Quarantine Department during the latter part of the Hashimite regime. Next heard of as partner of Hussain-al-Awayni (g*u.) in 1927. Has since managed Awayni’s piece-goods business in Jedda and acquired a considerable personal fortune in con junction with Awayni and Najib Salha (q.v.). Acts as land agent for the Amir Faysal. In 1943 built a large mansion outside Jedda, which he has now (July 1944’; let to the United States Legation at an exorbitant rental. Has also built a luxurious villa in Cairo. A close friend of Yusuf Yasin. Director of the “ Sa’udi Arabian Trading Company ” formed in January 1945 which advertises itself as importers of cars, tyres, refrigerators and miscellaneous machinery. The Dodge car agency formerly held by ’Awayni has been taken over by the company. According to Ibrahim Shaker two-thirds of the capital are owned by him and a third by Najib Salha. Ibrahim Shaker has also obtained the agencies of the Banque Misr and other Misr organisations, including the Misr Steamship Line in Sa’udi Arabia, and he is associated with Abdullah Suleyman in the exploitation of a valu able agricultural area near Hadda in the Wadi Fatma. He is used also by American big business. 34. Izzeddin Shawa. Born about 1905 in Gaza. Palestinian of a well- known family. Educated at St. Catherine’s College, Cambridge, where he took a diploma in agriculture. Speaks flawless English. Joined the rebels and took an active part against the British during the Palestine troubles in 1937-38. Was at one time private secretary to the Mufti. Violently anti-Jew. Came to Iraq in 1940 with his wife, who is French, and joined Rashid Ali’s rebel army in May 1941. Escaped after the rebellion had been crushed and was granted asylum by Ibn Sa’ud provided he refrained from political activities. He kept his word. Appointed Director of Agriculture at A1 Kharj early in 1944 and in April Director of the Office of Public Works at Jedda in succession to Najib Salha. A sincere Nationalist, he is outspoken about his views on Palestine, but is not really anti-British. The lega tion found him to be an intelligent and co-opera tive colleague in his new job, and therefore a pleasant change from the majority of Sa’udi officials. Has a son at Victoria College. He found the task of cleaning out the Augean stables of the Directorate of Transport, while fighting against Nejdi and Syrian influences, too much for him and, in June 1945, resigned. He then claimed that Ibn Saud had appointed him one of his personal advisers, but there has been no evidence that the King’s goodwill towards him can resist the constant intrigue and innuendo of Abdullah Suleyman, Yusuf Yassin and others, to whom a relatively honest and go-ahead Palestinian is a menace and a danger. Indeed, Izzeddin Shawa, who has been absent from Arabia for some months, is said to be moving heaven and earth to find some other employment. He was heard of in June 1946 lecturing in United States and is now representative in London of the Arab Higher Committee. 35. Muhammad' Id Rawwdf. Formerly Sa’udi Consul in Damascus. Born about * 1898. One of a Sherari family which migrated from Jauf to Damascus in 1910. Family not highly considered in Damascus, but ’Id’s father maintained 4 close connexion with Ibn Sa’ud and was helpful to him in negotiations with the Turks. He, the father, made a fortune in camel-dealing and left wealth to his two sons. According to his own account, Muhammad made a large sum of money during the Great War by buying up English bank notes in Damascus at a discount of 20 per cent, to 40 per cent., stealing away to Bagdad as soon as it fell into British hands, and cashing the notes at par. Appointed to his Damascus post in 1929 in sucession to his brother Yasin. Had then only had primary education, but was stated last year to be busily improving on it. Was considered by His Majesty’s present consul in Damascus rather stupid, thou^Ji pleasant and useful. Well informed on local curreHM®* of thought and pushes in Syrian Nationalist circles, without apparently carrying much weight, the idea of an Arab Empire with Ibn Sa’ud as a suitable ruler for it. The brother Yasin Rawwaf, whom he succeeded, is said to have become Governor of Medina in 1929-30. He was appointed second assistant to the Viceroy of the Hejaz in September 1930, but has faded out of Sa’udi official life and now lives at Damascus. Muhammad Td Rawwaf was superseded as consul at Damascus by Rusheyd Pasha (q.v.) in May 1933 and appointed an Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In 1935 was appointed Acting Governor (Kaimakam, not Amir) of Jedda, but in 1937 exchanged posts with Ibrahim ibn Mu’ammar. Ceased to be charg^ d’affaires at Bagdad in 1938, when a Sa’udi Minister was appointed, and was made a member of the Council of Ministers. 36. Idrisi Family. ^ Founded by Ahmed al Idrisi, a native of Fez, became a notable religious teacher at Mecca and^^ created a Tariqa, or school of religious doctrine. Moved on to Sabya, in ’Asir, where he acquired land and died in the odour of sanctity about 1837 and where his tomb is still venerated. The Idrisis supplanted the Sherifian family, which had ruled at Abfi ’Arish in the time of his son Muhammad and Muhammad’s son ’Ali. All members of the family have the title of Seyyid. There is a close connexion between the family and the Senusis, whose founder was a disciple of the original Ahmed al Idrisi. The spiritual relationship has been reinforced by intermarriage at various times. The Idrisis have also a connexion with the Mirghani family, whose head resides in the Sudan, and is chief of yet another Tariqa, once powerful and still important. For a fuller account of the family see Personalities Report for 1946. 36a. Kaaki Family. The war has brought into the limelight the previously unknown family of Kaaki. Reputedly of Syrian origin but long resident in the Hejaz, this family followed the traditional family calling of baking, as their name suggests. They dabbled in the money market and various members of the family were small independent money changers. They are■ 13 X now the real financiers of Sa’udi Arabia, and no money transaction ever now takes place without the Kaakis being directly concerned. They owe their present position first to Najib Salha (q-v.), the venal right hand man of Abdullah Suleyman and former Director of Public Works, and to Abdullah Suleyman himself. While His Majesty’s Govern ment were paying an annual subsidy to Ibn Sa’ud the Kaakis made money at will. A high pro portion of the subsidy goods that came into the country were dealt with by this family, and through their machinations and those of Najib and of Abdullah Suleyman much of the gold presented by His Majesty’s Government eventually found its way into the coffers of one or other of the various Kaaki firms. In 1944 Sadaka and Siraj Kaaki. the most important combination, were discovered in an attempt to smuggle f.gold 25,000 to Egypt. This money was confiscated and there were rumours of dire reprisals on the law-breakers. These however gradually faded into the background and when Ibn Sa’ud arrived in Jedda after meeting King Farouq at Yenbo. Sadaka and Siraj Kaaki petitioned His Majesty on the grounds that they did not know that they were doing wrong and the King, fresh from his successful entertainment of King Farouq, pardoned the Kaakis and returned them the money. It is certain that Abdullah Suleyman arranged this, Sadaka and Siraj having advanced the money by ^hich Ibn Sa’ud was able so royally to entertain ^Ang Farouq. A rough estimate of the family fortune is about £.gold 300,000 of which Sadaka and Siraj have, at the very least, £.gold 175,000, besides valuable property in Mecca. In April 1945 they started to interest themselves in real estate and began by purchasing from the Minister of Finance, Abdullah Suleyman, the Banque Misr Hotel and several other buildings in Mecca. The Banque Misr building alone cost £.gold 30,000. The most important members of this family are: (1) Sadaka Kaaki and (2) Siraj Kaaki. —Brothers, these two are partners in the most lucrative business in the country. They are the Government brokers and are represented in every town in the Hejaz and the Nejd with the exception of Medina where the financial activities of Sheikh Mohammed-al-Khuraiji are protected by his son-in-law, Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman. The firm of S. &amp; S. Kaaki is by far the most important of the Kaaki firms. Its 1940 capital was about ^fcgold 10,000—and is now at least £.gold 175,000. ^k\See also remarks above.) (3) Abdul Aziz Kaaki. —A money changer in Jedda who also owns a bakery business. Abdul Aziz’s pre-war worth was about T.gold 2,000—and now he can boast of something like £.gold 20,000. He also partners his tw'o uncles (see 4 and 5) in another firm of money changers in Jedda and Mecca, the capital of this being separate from the figure £.gold 20,000—mentioned above. (4) Salah Moussa Kaaki and (5) Abdullah Moussa Kaaki. —These two are brothers, and uncles, it is believed, of (1), (2) and (3) above. Before the war they were the most affluent of the Kaaki family and flourished in Mecca with a capital of something like £.gold 15,000. Their present capital exceeds £.gold 60,000—and from their partnership with Abdul Aziz Kaaki ((3) above) they have a share of a business which hardly existed before the war but is now worth £.gold 15,000. 37. Khdlid Al Qarqani (alias Al Hud, alias Abu’l Walid). A Tripolitan, who is said to have served under the Senusi, fought the Italians and retired into exile in Egypt, where he has a daughter married to Abdur-Rahman ’Azzam Bey, formerly a desert fighter in the Senusi cause, former Egyptian Minister to Iraq and Sa’udi Arabia and now Secretary- General of the Arab League. Al Qarqani was brought to Ibn Sa’ud s notice, it is said, by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, and came to the Hejaz in 1930. Was appointed in September 1930 First Assistant to the Viceroy, but apparently soon vacated the post and went into business with the German merchant, afterwards honorary German Consul, de Haas. W as re-employed by the Government to accompany the American engineer Twitchell on his tours of survey for water and minerals. W as sent with Hamad Suleyman {q-v.) to Asir in November 1932 to investigate the dispute between the Idrisi and Ibn Sa’ud’s Governor. This mission could not be accomplished by the two delegates, who, in the following year, with Turki al Madhi, formed an equally unsuccessful delegation to Sana before the outbreak of the Sa’udi-Yemen war. Was a Sa udi delegate to the Bahrein Transit Dues and Koweit Blockade Conferences of 1935. Was also a Sa’udi representative at the negotiations over the Red Sea oil concession with Petroleum Concessions (Limited) (added in 1939). Acted as buyer for certain German goods for the Sa’udi Government. In 1938 was found to be on the staff of Amir Sa’ud, but later in the year officially appointed to that of Ibn Sa’ud. Said to have a large salary. Seems to be a trusted adviser, and said to be honest in negotiation, though not necessarily scrupulous in financial matters. Accompanied Dr. Mahmud Hammuda to London and Paris in 1939 in connexion with the proposed amendment of the Sanitary Convention. A isited Germany in 1939 before the outbreak of war on a mission to purchase arms for Sa’udi Arabia. Had an interview with Hitler, but was otherwise unsuc cessful. Has a slight impediment in his speech. Speaks French and Turkish and perhaps Italian. Claims to have travelled a good deal in Europe, including Russia, and is regarded by Ibn Sa’ud as an expert on European affairs. An interesting talker but can be waspish. Said by some people to be anti- British but is probably only rather sourly pro-Arab. Is now in poor health (1943). Attempts by His Majesty’s Legation to obtain permission for Khalid (who has been given only tw r o years to live by his doctors) to settle in Egypt with his family have so far (June 1945) proved unsuccessful, but he paid a short visit to Cairo in the winter of 1945. In 1947 w r as hale and hearty at Riyadh. 38. Muhammad ibn 'Abdul 'Aziz ibn Mddhi. A Nejdi, formerly Governor of Jizan. Transferred about 1940 to be Governor of Al Khobar, which post he now holds. Speaks nothing but Arabic and that with a strong Nejdi accent. Comes much into contact with the Americans of the Arabian American Oil Company at Dhahran and was lavish in his hospitality to His Majesty’s Minister when he visited Dhahran in March 1942. Earned the gratitude of the Royal Air Force for his help when one of their aircraft forcelanded on Tarut Island in January 1942. A younger brother is Governor of the towm of Al- Qatif, and another brother, ’Abdul ’Aziz ibn Madhi, is Governor of Dhiba. 39. Mehdi Bey. Director-General of Police, with headquarters in Mecca, for several years, but in 1938 was made Director-General of Public Security, though no change in his functions was announced or observed. An ’Iraqi, wdio has, however, lived little in ’Iraq. Said to have been a regimental clerk in the Turkish army, in which a brother of his is still an officer. Was employed also in King Huseyn’s army. He appears to be arbitrary and ruthless and to wield considerable authority. A man of organising ability, and the Mecca orphanage, which is under his charge, has been declared by a competent Indian witness to be the best-organised concern in Sa’udi Arabia. In 1938, when he had extended the system of regular14 police to Hasa, he was given by Ibn Sa’ud the title of al Muslih (The Reformer). Went on leave in autumn 1945 and has not yet returned. 40. ’Abdur-Rahman ibn Mubarak. Governor of Wejh. Little known to the Legation, but worth mentioning because of the importance of his post in relation to Egypt and Transjordan, and because he was one of the leaders of the forces, with advanced base at Dhaba, employed against Ibn Rifada in 1932. Is possibly a tribal personage rather than an administrative Governor, and may be of the family of Huseyn ibn Mubarak of the Harb tribe, who was a power at Rabigh at the time of the Arab revolt. 41. Muhammad at-Tawil. A native of Jedda of Egyptian origin. Got a small post in the customs in Turkish times and rose to be Director of Customs in Jedda under King Huseyn. Played a leading part in the movement of the Hejazi notables to compel Huseyn’s abdication and the accession of King Ali in October 1924. Remained in theory Director of Customs only, but wielded great influence under ’Ali, and was described as being “ practically dictator ” in November 1925, after his triumph in a dispute with Ahmed Saqqaf, the Prime Minister, who decided to leave. Promised at that time to devote to the cause of the Hejaz every penny of “ certain economies ” which he had effected while Director of Customs. Left the Hejaz on the fall of Jedda, but returned in 1927 or early in 1928 and started a motor transport business. Was said in 1928 to have been president of the Hizb-al-Ahrar al Hijazi, but made his peace with Ibn Sa’ud after an absence at Riyadh, which was described in February 1928 as a deportation. Was slow to receive official employment, and was perhaps considered unsuitable for such employment in the Hejaz, but was in September 1930 placed at the head of a commission to study and reorganise the financial and economic situation in Hasa. Remained for some time in this employment, despite rumours of assassination or flight. Appeared to have tightened up regulations and trodden on Qusaibi corns in the process, but not to have made the Hasa Customs as paying as he hoped. A capable and well-reputed man, liked by the authorities at Bahrein, but he fell foul of the Arabian American Oil Company to such an extent that Sayyid Hashim was sent to look after their business with the Government in 1935. At-Tawil was recalled in 1936 and replaced by two separate officials in his posts as Director of Finance and Director of Customs. In 1938 appointed (against his will) manager of the Nejd Motor Transport Company. Since 1943 appears to have lived in retirement on his estate in Hasa. The company is now defunct. 42. Mustafa Badruddin. Formerly Director of Customs in Jedda. A North African or of North African origin. Born probably about 1892. Was given a small post in the Jedda custom-house some years ago, and later became Director of Customs at Yanbu’. Transferred to Jedda in the same capacity in 1930. A man of little ability, obstructive and not very honest. Popularly supposed to hold “ Axis views ” and certainly conceals very well any affection he may have for the British. Is reputed to be well in with gangs of dhow-men smuggling goods across the Red Sea. Arrested in May 1944 when a large consignment of gold was caught being smuggled out of Jedda to Egypt. Released shortly after. Finally dismissed in Decem ber 1945. Now resident in Medina. 43. Ibrahim an-Neshmi. Formerly Amir of Jauf. Said to be a Nejdi; to have been originally a maker of native foot-gear; to have been in Medina while the Hashimites still held it; and to have escaped to the Sa udi side, where his knowledge of the situation in Medina was so useful that he was given a command. He appears to have been employed at Tebuk and perhaps at Yanbu’ in the ensuing years. He became notorious in February 1930 for a large-scale raid into Trans jordan similar to that of ’Abdul-’Aziz ibn Musa’id (q.v.) about the same time. He was apparently at the time already Governor of Jauf, a post from which the King dismissed him about the end of the year, not, it was explained, because the man was bad, but because the King desired to eliminate causes of quarrel with His Majesty's Government. Reappeared subsequently as Governor of Al-’Ula, but was trans ferred to an unspecified post in or about June 1933. Later one of the more important subordinate com manders in the Western Army on the Sa’udi-Yemen border. Governor of Turaba in 1934 until September 1935, when he was appointed Governor of Najran. 44. Qdttdn Family. (1) Yusuf ibn Salim Qaitdn, said to have been originally a servant in a coffee-shop in Mecca and afterwards of the original Qattan family whose name he took. Became a guide for Javanese pilgrims. Rose to be president of the Mecca municipality under the Turks, but was still so uneducated that he was said to be unable to tell “ the letter Alif from a telegraph pole.” Became Minister of Publf^^^ Works under King Huseyn. Was said in 1930 to be full of schemes connected with the pilgrimage and the advancement of his son No. (2) below. Has also come to notice as one of the agents concerned with the properties of the Sherifian family. (2) 'Abbas Qattdn, an ambitious man, born about 1901, who was himself president of the municipality in Mecca in 1930 and occupied that post until Novem ber 1945. Also formerly director-general of Waqfs. 45. Qusaibi Family. An important merchant family in the Persian Gulf The legation is indebted to the political agent in Bahrein for an account of them, of which a summary appears in the Personalities Report for 1946. The Qusaibis formerly had great influence owing to their position as agents of Ibn Sa’ud in Bahrein and buyers of his requirements for Nejd, as well as to their wealth and their hold on many to whom they had lent money. Their most distinguished debtor wa^ the King himself, who owed them in 1930 somethin/ ^ like £80,000, and who, although about half of this ? had been paid off by June 1931, still owed them the balance. Abdurrahman was given in the latter year a roving commission to try and raise the wind for the Sa’udi Government in Europe, but failed completely. The relations of the Qusaibis with the King no longer seem to be as close as formerly. They resented the reforms introduced by Muhammad at-Tawil {q.v.). They were driven by bad business to press the King for money. He has of late employed other persons to buy for him, but he is not known to have deprived the Qusaibis of their general agency for him at Bahrein. The Amir Sa’ud frequently employed the Qusaibis to buy goods for him in Bombay, but was said in April 1942 to have become dissatisfied with them and to be employing other agents. 46. Rashid Family. Former rulers of Hail. Little is known of the remnants of this family once so powerful and later so fallen, even before its final collapse, that it was “ accounted infamous, even in such a land of violence as Arabia, for its record of domestic murders.” It deserves attention, however, because of the possibility of its reappearance on the scene, e.g., if the Shammar tribes from which it sprang should go against Ibn Sa’ud. It is understood that, after the fall of Hail, the King pursued a policy of15 absorption, not of annihilation, and that many persons belonging to the Beni Rashid, or connected with them, passed into his entourage. Two lads who are being brought up with his younger children and are included in the list of his sons are said to be the children of a Rashid lady, whom Ibn Sa’ud married after their birth. Their names are— (1) Sultan and (2) Mish’al — the latter of which corresponds with that of an infant child of the last ruling ibn Rashid, as given in the 1917 volume of Personalities in Arabia. Two other persons have come to notice, who are said to be related to the Beni Rashid, viz.: — (3) Mansur ibn 'Asaf, who is said to have been taken into Ibn Sa'ud’s service and to have served for a term as Governor of Tebuk; and his brother— (4) Ndsir ibn ’Asaf, who also served Ibn Sa’ud, but was reported to have deserted into Transjordan in 1931. As the information about this family is so meagre, it is worth noting that the following members of it accompanied Ibn Sa’ud from Riyadh to Jedda in March 1934: — (5) Muhammad ibn Talal (a daughter of his was married to Ibn Sa’ud in 1938). ( 6 ) 7) ( 8 ) (9) Mash’al ibn Mas’ud ibn ’Abdul ’Aziz. Rashid al Muheysin al Jabr. Sultan ibn Talal al Jabr. Fahad ibn Hamud al Jabr. Of these (6) and (8) may be identical with (1) and (2) given above. The Umm al Qura early in 1935 gave a list of the Beni Rashid who came to the Hejaz with Ibn Sa’ud in March of that year. This list gave all the names, except (6), unless the name Mash’al al Sa’ud in the 1935 list corresponded with the same person. Two other names appear in the 1935 list. (10) ’Abdullah al Mit’ib, who died in 1947. (11) ’Ubaid al ’Abdullah. At least one Ibn Rashid accompanied the King’s son, the Amir Faysal, to the Yemen front in April. 1934 - The younger princes are greatly in evidence in Ibn Sa’ud’s entourage, being treated generally very much like his own younger sons. The only member of the family outside Sa’udi ^rabia, and therefore of some importance, is (12) Muhammad ibn ’Abdul Muhsin ar Rashid, bom about 1910. Lives at the Court of the King of Iraq (according to a 1935 report), out of whose privy purse he is said to receive a pension of about £20 a month. Twice stated to have set out, with the cognisance of the late King ’Ali, to raise the Shammar, cross the frontier and take Hail, but returned on each occasion with standards still unfurled, having judged the moment not propitious. Still keeps in touch with the Shammar and maintains bedouin mode of life. Described as ordinarily a rather dull, brooding young man, and perhaps not very resourceful, but, presented with a good enough opportunity, he would quickly be off across the desert to recapture his ancestral home. Two members of the family, Saud and Abdul Aziz, w r ho had been living in Riyadh, “ escaped ” -by car in October 1947 and subsequently turned up in Iraq. This event seems to have considerably upset the King, w r ho may fear that they are hatching some plot with his enemies. 47. Rifdda Family. Chiefs of the Billi tribe, with an urban establish ment at Wejh. The most notable recent member of the family, Suleyman Afnan, played a not incon siderable role during the Great War, but was killed in a raid in 1916 and left two sons, Ibrahim and Ahmed. His brother Salim, who had died earlier, left a son, Hamid. The cousins in this generation were at enmity. Hamid made a bid for the Sheikhship on his uncle’s death. He was one of several Hejazi Sheikhs who approached the Residency in Cairo in 1924, complaining both of King Huseyn’s tyranny and his inability to protect them against the Wahhabis. He came into greater prominence in 1928, when, having returned from Transjordan and taken to brigandage, he attempted a coup at Wejh, hoping to dislodge his cousin Ibrahim, who was Governor there and head of the tribe. After a further period of exile he came into still greater prominence in 1932 by invading the Hejaz at the head of a rebel band. He and two, it was said, of his sons were killed, but there may be survivors of this branch. At the outset of the revolt Ibrahim visited the King at the head of a loyal delegation. He is still head of the Billi tribe in the Hejaz, but the Governor of Wejh is now r Ibn Mubarak (see No. 40). The family have attaches with a section of the Billi established in Egypt. 48. Rushdi Malhas. Was editor of the Umm al Qura, the more important of the two weekly newspapers published at Mecca and the unofficial organ of the Sa’udi Government. A Palestinian from Nablus. In 1937 or before was appointed Assistant Director of the Political Section of the Royal Diwan. The following year had a violent quarrel with his chief, Yusuf Yasin, but retained his position and eventually succeeded him as Director of the Political Section of the Royal Diwan. In appearance a down-trodden little man, but away from his chief he is affable and talkative. Well read in Arabic literature and history. Speaks good Turkish and some French. 49. Salih ibn A bu Bakr Shdta. Born probably not later than 1890. Comes of a learned family in Mecca, where he was born. Much employed on Committee for Waqfs, grain distribu tion, kc., under the Hashimite regime. Fled to Jedda after the Sa’udi capture of Taif. Was one of the Hejazi notables who compelled the abdication of King Huseyn in October 1924 and rallied in due course to Ibn Sa’ud. Became one of two assistants to the Amir Faysal in his capacity as Viceroy. Spoken of in 1930 as a possible Minister of Educa tion in a Cabinet then rumoured to be in contempla tion, but, if the rumour was true, the project was not pursued. When the Cabinet was eventually organised on its present lines early in 1932 and the Amir Faysal was given the Ministry of the Interior, as well as others. Salih Shata was made his chief assistant in that Ministry. In 1986 was a member of the Legislative Assembly. Related to No. 67. Referred to in 1943 as “ Second Deputy ” of the Advisory Council. 50. Sidayri Family. Take their name from the district of Sidayr in Nejd. Are related to Ibn Sa’ud through the fact that his mother was a Sidayri. He has, moreover, taken two wives from the family. Six members of the family are worthy of notice, viz.: — (1) ’Abdullah as-Sidayri, Governor of Tebuk since about the beginning of 1931. Transferred early in 1936 to Medina (see No. 2). (2) Turki as-Sidayri, Governor of Asir, with head quarters at Abha. (3) ’Abdul 'Aziz as-Sidayri, Governor of Jauf, with headquarters at Qariyat. Because of the proximity of his Governorate to Transjordan and his frequent contacts with the authorities of that country he is the best known and most important member of the family. (4) Muhammad as-Sidayri, younger brother of (3), Governor of Sakaka. (5) Ahmad ibn Turki as-Sidayri, Governor of Al-Qunfida.■■■■■■■■ 16 (6) Abdur Rahman as-Sidayri, formerly Governor of Dhofor, appointed Governor of Jedda in April of 1945. A handsome, cruel-looking man. Not par ticularly bright, but wisely relies on Aly Taha (q.v.) for advice in his post. Fond of motoring and hunting. Probably born about 1910. 51. Shaibi Family. Important in Mecca as the Keepership of the Key of the Ka’aba is hereditary in the family. The prerogative is very lucrative because all persons entering the Ka’aba are supposed to make a present to the Keeper according to their means. The family are admittedly descendants of the Quraysh tribe, but not of the Prophet. It is claimed that the pedigree is continuous from pre-Islamic times and that the right to keep the key also dates from that early period. According to one story, there was a blot on the escutcheon in the 19th century, when the male descent failed and the succession passed through a lady of the family who married a slave. The late Keeper’s physical appearance suggested that this might be true, but there is no proof of it. Another branch of the family, claiming similar descent, formerly lived in Tunis, but now resides in Mecca. The present Keeper of the Key is— (1) Muhammad ash-Sha’ibi, an elderly man, probably the nephew of the late Keeper, who died in January 1934 and whom this relative was appointed to succeed. (2) Abdullah ash-Sha'ibi, next in succession as Keeper of Key. Is member of the Legislative Assembly and has held numerous other important posts of an honorary nature. Highly respected. 52. Sherifian Family. Also called Hashimites by virtue of descent from the great-grandfather of the Prophet, but this name seems to be more particularly affected by the family of King Huseyn. There have been in the past and are in the present numerous families claiming this descent through one or other of the sons of ’AH, the fourth Caliph and son-in-law of the Prophet. There are in Arabia itself many individuals bearing the title of Sherif, which is held to imply descent from Hasan, the elder son of ’Ali, and the whole clan is known collectively as Ashraf. The strains most con spicuous in the Hejaz trace this descent through an intermediate common ancestor Hasan ibn Abu Numey, who was Grand Sherif of Mecca in the latter part of the 16th century. Three groups of his descendants are accounted specially important, viz.: — The Dhawl Zeyd, The Abadila, a particular branch of whom are the Dhawi ’Aun, and The Dhawi Barakat. All Grand Sherifs of Mecca in the 17th century were drawn from the rival Dhawi Zeyd and Dhawi ’Aun. The last Grand Sherif belonging to the former was ’Abdul-Mutallib, who held the post three times at long intervals. The majority belonged to the Dhawi ’Aun, of whom came the late King Huseyn and his sons. Although the most important members of the Sherifian family now live outside Sa’udi Arabia, their connexion with the Hejaz is so close as to justify this general notice. The following list, very incom plete, shows those who are worthy of notice : — (A) Dhawi Zeyd. (1) ’Alt Haydar. —Formerly resided in Constan tinople. Worked in with the Young Turks and was at one time Minister of Auqaf. Appointed Grand Sherif to supersede King Huseyn in or about 1917, but was naturally unable to assume the post effectively. Sought early in 1926 for British support in obtaining post of Regent or Governor of Hejaz under Ibn Sa’ud. Moved later that year to Beirut, where he died in 1934. Had several sons, the eldest of whom, Abdul-Majid, is married to a Turkish princess (w'ho is not, however, as stated in a previous Personalities Report, a daughter of the ex-Caliph ’Abdul Majid), and showed signs of political ambition after the Armistice. He is now Transjordan Minister in London. One of AH Haydar’s wives and the mother of two of his younger daughters is of British birth. Yet another son studied at St. Andrew’s and had the distinction of acting as best man at the marriage of a Scotch divine at St. Giles’s Cathedral. Civilised people, important to keep in mind, though of no obvious political importance at present. (2) Ja’afar Haidar, brother of the above. Also lived in Constantinople. If alive, may be identical with the elderly Sherif ’AH Ja’far who lived at Lahej in 1932 and was described as a descendant of ’Abdul- Mutallib. (3) Sharaf 'Adnan Pasha al Ghdlib as-Zeyd .— Formerly frequented both Constantinople and the Hejaz. Spoken of in 1925 as a possible ruler of the Hejaz, if Ibn Sa’ud won the war. Elected president of the Moslem Congress at Mecca in June 1926, and was later the vehicle of Ibn Sa’ud’s refusal to hold another owing to attitude of the AH brothers. Represented Ibn Sa’ud in 1927 at conference at Jizan to deal with the Red Sea Petroleum Compands concession in the Farsan Islands. Described in 1^^ as “ grizzled and doddering.” Still resides in Mecca, but apparently a back number. (4) Sharaf Ridha, usually called Sherif Sharaf tout court. —Appointed Acting Minister of Finance under Ibn Sa’ud in January 1926. Resides in Mecca and is now a member of the Legislative Council. In 1936 appointed to be a member of the King’s suite. Appears to spend all his time at Mecca and Taif. A courteous, dignified man, rather silent and with something of a brooding air. (5) Khdlid. —A nephew of the ’AH Ja’far mentioned at (2). Implicated in the conspiracy against Ibn Sa’ud in 1932 and was active in and around Aden. Perhaps the same as Sherif Khalid Sadiq Adnan. (B) Dhawi ’Aun. (6) ’AU ibn ’Abdullah.—Formerly Grand Sherif. Dismissed by the Turks in 1907. Resides in Egypt. Described in June 1932 as an active supporter of the Hizb-al-Ahrar al Hijazi. (7) ’AU ibn Huseyn. —Ex-King of the Heji^P^^ Succeeded King Huseyn on his abdication in October 1924, but was compelled to abandon untenable position in Jedda in December 1925. Resided mostly in Bagdad, where he died on the 13th February, 1935. (8) Faysal ibn Huseyn. —King of Iraq. Died in 1934 and was succeeded by his son Ghazi, who died in 1939 leaving an infant son Faysal. (9) ’Abdullah ibn Huseyn. —Amir of Transjordan. (10) Zeyd ibn Huseyn. —Had a Turkish mother, a granddaughter of the well-known Grand Vizier Reshid Pasha, and has property interests quite distinct from those of his brothers. Born in Constantinople in 1900—formerly Iraqi Minister at Ankara. Appointed Iraqi Minister at Berlin in September 1935. Now resides in Turkey occasionally visiting his nephew’ the Amir ’Abdul Hah, Regent of Iraq. All these, except perhaps (10), have issue. So had King Huseyn’s brother Nasir, now’ deceased, whpdeft six sons and four daughters. (10a) ’Abdul Hamid Al’Aun. —Understood to be a grandson of (6). Chiefly noteworthy as being the principal figure in the Sherifian plot against Ibn Sa’ud in 1940. Arrested and sentenced to death, he was pardoned (Amir ’Abdullah of Transjordan interceded for him). After a period of detention at Riyadh he w’as allowed to leave the country with the tw T o younger brothers and some other relatives who w’ere also implicated. Now believed to be in Egypt.(C) Dhawi Barakat. (11) Sharaf ibn 'Abdul-Muhsin. —Seems to have served King Huseyn in Egypt, but entered the ser vice of Ibn Sa’ud and became Amir-al-Arban, or Director of Tribes. Appointed President of the Inspectorate of Government Departments in 1930. His present official status is not known, as the inspectorate is understood to have been abolished. (D) Apparently of the Abadila stocks though not of the Dhawi ’Aim. (12) Shakir ibri Zeyd ibn Fawwdz. —Formerly Governor of Taif, a post which seems to have been hereditary in his family. President of the Beduin Control Board in Transjordan and intimately associated with the Amir ’Abdullah, with whom he has thrown in his lot. Died at Amman in December 1934. Was a tenacious enemy of Ibn Sa’ud and much less a play-boy than his master. (13) Hamud ibn Zeyd, brother of the preceding.— Probably the same as the ‘ Sharif Hamud ’ who joined the plot with No. (10a) and was carried off to Riyadh, dying, it is said, on the road. (14) Sharaf ibn Rdjih, a cousin of (12) and (13)— Said to have also been Governor of Taif at one time. Now resides at Bagdad. Identified both in Jerusalem and Bagdad as being the Sherif Sharaf mentioned by Tahir ad-Dabbagh in February 1932, in a letter which fell into the hands of the Sa’udi Government, a man who might be enlisted in the conspiracy ‘against Ibn Sa’ud. (E) Even less easy to place, but perhaps of the Abadila. (15) ’Alt ibn Ahmad ibn Mansur. —A younger member of a family, two of whom were prominent in King Huseyn’s time and had great mfluence in the Harb tribe. This ’Ali has only come to notice as having been one of the persons arrested at Mecca and deported to Riyadh at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair in 1932. (16) ’Alt ibn Huseyn al Harithi. —One of the Sherifs of Muda’iq, near Taif. Took part in the Arab revolt and is remembered as one of the conquerors of Damascus. Described by Colonel Lawrence as having been at that time an attractive young man, physically splendid and full of courage, resource and energy. Seems to have resettled in the Hejaz, as he was arrested at Mecca and deported to Riyadh at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair in 1932. (17) Muhammad Mohanna. —One of the Jedda ^\mily, one member of which was chief of the Con- trolling Department in 1917, and was then described as a “ bottle-nosed bandit,” while his brother, still alive, was said to have acquired wealth by smuggling and general robbery. This Muhammad is only interesting because he was arrested at Jedda and sent to Riyadh at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair. (18) and (19) M. ’Ali and Muhammad al-Bedeywi (a diminutive of Bedawi). Members of a family distantly related to King Huseyn and formerly important in the Juheyna tribe and in the coast towns of the Northern Hejaz. Despite the similarity of name, they would appear to be two distinct, though closely related persons. Both w T ere mixed up in the Ibn Rifada affair in 1932. M. ’Ali became an object of attention in Transjordan and was more or less arrested in July to the displeasure of the ’Amir. Muhammad seems to have been in trade at Suez and Dhaba and was concerned in attempts to get supplies by sea to Ibn Rifada. It was probably he who was reported killed in the defeat of the rebels. 53. Suwayt Family. Leaders in the Dhafir tribe. Two members of it figured in reports from Kuwait about 1936: — (1) Ja’ddn, a disgruntled man, hovering between allegiance to King Faysal or to Ibn Sa’ud and too proud to come to terms with either; and (2) 'Ajemi, recognised as chief of the tribe by Ibn Sa’ud. 54. Abu Tuqeyqa Family. Formerly chiefs of the Tihama, mainly Hejazi, section of the Huweytat tribe, with an urban con nexion at Dhaba. Rafi’a, their common ancestor, was chief of the tribe prior to his death in about 1870. One of his many grandsons, Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Rafi’a, was chief in 1917. He came to notice in 1924 as one of several Hejazi sheykhs who approached the Residency in Cairo with a com plaint of King Huseyn’s tryranny and his inability to protect them against the Wahhabis. He appears to have been Governor of Dhaba in 1927, but in that year the family were apparently in serious trouble with the Government, as it is said that Ahmed and four others were ” killed by Ibn Sa’ud,” and others fled to Egypt. Numerous members of the family were concerned in the rebel invasion of the Hejaz by Ibn Rifada in 1932. Seven of them lost their lives in that adventure and five more were reported by the Sa’udi commander to have been slain after Ibn Rifada’s defeat. Among the survivors was, how ever— (1) Muhammad ibn [ ?] Abdurrahim ibn Alwdn ibn Rafi’a, who was regarded as co-leader with Ibn Rifada. He escaped, and after many vicissitudes left ’Aqaba for Egypt early in October 1932. May be the person against wffiom an exclusion order was made in Egypt rather later, but whose name is given as Muhammad bin Ahmed. Another probable survivor is— (2) Mahmud ibn Ahmed ibn Rafi’a, who ratted on Ibn Rifada early in the rebellion and tried to make his peace with Ibn Sa’ild. Although the above summary cannot be verified at all points, it is inserted in view r of the obvious tenacity of the family hatred of Ibn Sa’ud, and the survival of (1), who seems to have been an active leader and may crop up again. 55. Turki ibn Madhi. Was in 1932 Inspector-General of ’Asir and was associated with Fahad ibn Zu’ayr in efforts to make Ibn Sa’ud realise the gravity of the situation pre ceding the open revolt of the Idrisi at the end of October. Identical with the person mis-named at the time ’Abdullah ibn Turki ibn Mahdi, who, with Abdul-Wahhab Abu Malha and two chiefs of Asiri tribes, w r as sent on a mission to the Imam Yahya in June 1927. Took part in further negotia tions with the Imam early in 1928. Would therefore appear to be one of Ibn Sa’ud’s experts in ’Asir and Yemen affairs. Accompanied Khalid al Qarqani and Hamad Suleyman on their fruitless mission to San’a in 1933, before the outbreak of the Sa’udi Yemen war. Visited the Yemen again in May 1943, and in the autumn of 1944 as Ibn Sa’lid’s special envoy to the Imam. The real purpose of his visit w r as to report on conditions in the Yemen. He described the people as groaning under the yoke of the Imam and anxious to transfer their allegiance to Ibn Sa’ud. 56. Yahya an Nasri. Formerly principal quarantine doctor at Jedda. A Syrian, like most doctors now employed by the Sa’udi Government. Born probably about 1897. Studied in Constantinople and Beirut. Previously quarantine doctor at Yanbu’. Pleasant and well regarded by the legation. Speaks Turkish and French. Was Sa’udi delegate to the meeting of the International Health Office, Paris, in October 1934. Appointed early in 1943 to be Director-General of Public Health in succession to Mahmud Hamdi Hamuda. (See 1937 report.) Reported to have 34901 D18 suffered a mental collapse and to have left for treatment in January 1945. lielieved of his post in May 1946. 57. Yusuf Yasin, Shaikh. Probably bom about 1898. A Syrian from Latakia, said by his enemies to be of Yezidi origin. Was at school in Jerusalem in 1917. Joined King Faisal at 'Aqaba and went with him to Damascus. Left on the approach of the French and joined King Huseyn in Mecca. Attached by him to the Amir Abdullah at 'Amman, with whom he remained six months. Formed so low an opinion of the ’Amir that, according to his own account, he broke with Huseyn in consequence. Joined Ibn Sa’ud in due course. Came to Mecca in 1924-“25 and started the Umm-al- Qura newspaper. Figured as a Nejdi delegate at the Moslem Congress of June 1926. Remained editor of the Umm-ai-Qura for some years, but was also official Director of Publicity. Took part in negotia tions with Sir G. Clayton in 1925, 1927 and 1928. Acted as Minister for Foreign Affairs in absence of 'Dr. ’Abdullah Damluji in 1926 and 1927. Reported in 1928 to have worked to undermine influence both of Damluji, who resigned that year, and of Hafiz Wahba {q-v.). Employed in various negotiations and again acted at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, for Fuad Hamza early in 1931, and for the Amir Faysal and Fuad as w'ell in 1932, but has for some years been principally important as a personal secretary to the King, who made him head of the political section of his diwan in 1930, and whom he always accompanies. Was intermittently in charge of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, during the absences of Fuad Hamza, in 1934, 1935 and 1936. Went to Bagdad at the end of 1935 to negotiate the Sa’udi- Traq Treaty of Brotherhood and Alliance. Was notorious for his obstructiveness during the Clayton negotiations, and is naturally obstinate and hair splitting in discussion, but can on occasion be amiable and even conciliatory. Takes his cue, in fact, from the King himself, to whom he appears to be genuinely devoted, and who probably trusts him as much as any of his near advisers, except ’Abdullah Suleyman. Is probably a more convinced Wahhabi than most of the King’s alien entourage and is also a strong Arab nationalist, with fewer ulterior motives than Fuad Hamza, having a simpler character and less European knowledge. Has the eyes of a fanatic, but has acquired the figure of a bon vivant. Works very hard but delights in creating difficulties and seeks to earn his master’s praise for solving problems of his own manufacture. He feels sufficiently sure of his usefulness to the King and the real power of his position to allow' himself to be the butt of the King and of those who aim their wit the same way as the King, and often deliberately plays the clown when he judges the King to be in the mood. His gluttony and monogamy are standing palace jokes. He is very jealous of Abdullah al Suleyman and of the latter’s powerful assistant, Najib Salha. As the principal channel of communication between the King and the legation he has in practice exercised the functions of Foreign Minister, the Amir Faysal being little more than a figure-head. He was the negotiator for Sa udi Arabia of the Sa’udi-Koweit Agreements which he signed at Jedda on the 20th April, 1942. He still exercises control over the Umm-ul-Qura and drafts official communiques for publication in it. He has much increased the stock of English w'hich he acquired during a short stay in Surbiton w'hen he accompanied the Amir Sa’ud to England for the coronation of King George VI. Speaks Arabic with perhaps greater rapidity than any other man in Arabia and retains something of his native North Lebanon accent. Went on a visit to Lattaqia, where he and his two brothers own farm property, in May 1943. A rapprochement took place between him and Najib Salha (No. 69) in 1943 and he bitterly opposed the latter’s dismissal in April 1944, remaining in close touch with him after his departure to Egypt. During the discussions between His Majesty’s Minister and Ibn Sa’ud early in 1944 on the reorganisation of Sa udi finances and economy was mostly obstructive and supported Abdullah Suleiman in opposing any proposals for reform. A pompous busybody, his loyalty to the King appears to be genuine though it occasionally serves as a cloak to hide personal motives. A difficult colleague with the small-mindedness of a Latakian grocer but not unpleasant if taken with a pinch of salt. His English continues to improve, thanks to the successive efforts of legation secretaries and, latterly, he claims, of the American pilots of the Sa udi air craft in which he so frequently flies. He has, perhaps, mellow'ed somewhat with the passing of time. He can be genial and amusing in the conduct of official business, though on occasion he can combine the stubbornness of a mule with the slipperiness of an eel. Was the Sa’udi delegate at the Preparatory Committee Meeting of the Arab Conference at Alexandria in October 1944, and signed the covenant of the Arab League on behalf of Sa’udi Arabia in March 1945. Accompanied Ibn Sa’ud on his visit to Egypt for the meetings with President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill in February 1945. Was the Sa’udi delegate at the special meeting of the Arab League assembly in June to discuss the Syrian crisis. /■ He has been Saudi delegate at all meetings O- the Arab League Council, and this has kept him for long periods away from Jedda, much to the relief of the local foreign missions. Unfortunately, he leaves no one responsible or intelligent in charge during his absence. His feud with the Minister of Finance grew in bitterness during 1945-46, and, as a sop for one uncomfortable scene between the two of them, Ibn Sa’ud appointed him to the rank of Minister of State. Shaikh Yusuf, when accompanying the King on his state visit to Egypt, pocketed considerable sums intended for the remuneration of Egyptian journalists. He also asked King Farouq’s Chief Aide-de-camp to find him a little estate in Egypt costing from £E.40,000 to £E.50,000. Like most of those around the King, he is busily making hay while the sun shines. His wife, who lives in a Cairo suburb, is said to be dissolute and a drunkard. 58. Muhammad Surur as-Sabbdn. Administrator of the Finance Department. Soi of a slave of the Sabban family (mother stated to have been Abyssinian), and became the moving spirit in their hide and skin business, which was at one time important, but became latterly bankrupt. Was a clerk in the municipality under King Huseyn, and is said to have tried to assassinate Ibn Sa’ud when he conquered the Hejaz in 1925, and to have been subsequently incarcerated at Riyadh. Returned to the Hejaz about 1929 and was taken up by the Minister of Finance, whose powerful influence got him appointed to his present post. Became second only to him in the Ministry of Finance in practical importance, and during the latter’s absence at Hudeyda in May 1934 was in effective control of it. Manager of the Arabian Export Company, a corpora tion formed to promote the export trade of the country. Continues to have great influence and to be much concerned in commercial enterprises. Reported in 1936 to have a great following in official circles. Pleasant, generous and most capable. Has a younger brother, Abdullah, w r ho is not, however, of any importance. By 1939 Muhammad Surur had lost all influence, and was kept strictly to the limits of his post as head of the Accounts Branch of the Ministry of Finance. Since the dismissal of Najib Salha (q.v.) has rapidly regained his influence. Early in 1945 was reported to have quarrelled with Shaikh Abdullah Suleyman owing to the appoint ment over him of an Inspector in the Ministry of ra19 Finance. Left for Egypt in a huff in June. He returned in the autumn of 1945, apparently recon ciled. As head of the newly-created Department of Pilgrimage Affairs, he has produced a more reasonable tariff than usual and has shown himself most forthcoming and helpful. 59. 'Abdul Kerim ibn Zeyd. Appointed Governor of Qaf in 1936. Nephew of ’Abdul-Aziz ibn Zeyd (No. 5). 60. 'Abdullah Khawaiter. Of Nejdi origin. Born about 1887. Intimate of ’Abdullah Suleyman and Hamad Suleyman with A ^ whom he spent many years in Bombay. Head of a section of the Ministry of Finance and may be a coming man. Is spoken of as a rival to Muhammad Surur (No. 58). Najib Salha. Attended the Preparatory Committee Meeting of the Arab Conference in Alexandria in October 1944 with Yusuf Yasin and also the discus sions which led up to the signing of the Covenant of the Arab League in March 1945. Sent for to Jedda June 1946 and on several subsequent occasions to act for Shaikh Yusuf Yasin during the latter's absence on Arab League business. It may be that this practice will be followed on similar future occasions. Though Shaikh Khairuddin is probably un scrupulous and something of an intriguer, he has maintained good relations with His Majesty’s Legation and has generally been friendly and help ful, when he has considered it to be within his power to be so. He is not anxious to assume responsi bility in any form—but he is not unique in that. In 1947 accompanied the Amir Nawwaf (q v.) on a trip through the United States. 61. Asaf ibn Huseyn. Appointed Governor of Najran and the “ territories of Yam ” in 1934, after the conclusion of the Treaty of Taif with the Yemen. Had previously been Governor of Rus. 62. Ibrahim Shura. Egyptian. Born about 1897. Came to the Hejaz ^m about 1928 as a teacher. Appointed head of the ^^'^ducation Department at Mecca in 1930. Friendly with Sheykh Hafiz Wahba. Amiable but unimpres sive. Has a smattering of English. In 1936 appointed head of the Sa’udi Pilgrimage Propaganda Bureau at Mecca. 63. Jamil Baud al Musallimi. Legal adviser, or assistant, in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Born about 1906. A Hejazi trained in Egypt. Good knowledge of English. Received his present appointment vice Td Rawwaf (No. 35) in January 1936. This was notable chiefly as a Hejazi encroachment on what has been for some time almost a Syrian preserve, and was attributed to the influence of Amir Feysal. Jamil Daud is brother of a pilgrim guide whose activities have come to the unfavourable notice of the legation. Has been found on many occasions obstructive and tactless. Is probably neither very intelligent nor energetic. Has shown himself latterly (1944) to be more co-operative ^in his dealings with the legation. Accompanied the ^YSa’udi delegation to the San Francisco Conference ' in April 1945. Appointed first secretary at the London legation, August 1945. 64. Kamil al Qassdb. Syrian. Born about 1875. Formerly Acting Director of Education in the Hejaz under King Huseyn. Later threw in his lot with Ibn Sa’ud and became Sa’udi propagandist. Prominent in 1936 during troubles in Palestine on account of his activities as Ibn Sa’ud’s go-between with the Supreme Arab Committee at Jerusalem, where he went from Egypt when charged with communica tions from Ibn Sa’ud. Paid an unobtrusive visit in summer of 1936 to the Hejaz, and in 1937 tried to persuade Ibn Sa’ud to take part in a Moslem conference on Palestine. In 1942 was fishing for the post of Syrian representative to Sa’udi Arabia. 65. Khairuddin Zuraikli. Syrian journalist. Born about 1880. Editor of Al Qibla, Mecca newspaper, official organ of King Huseyn for some years. Later was Hashimite propagandist in Egypt. Go-between between King Ali and Ibn Sa’ud. Later joined the latter. Adviser to the Sa’udi Agency in Cairo in 1935. Now counsellor of the Sa’udi Lega tion there. A crony of Shaikh Yusuf Yasin and 66. Muhammad Sddiq ibn Abdullah. Born in Hejaz about 1888. In 1920 was principal of the Military School at Mecca. Was commandant of the Jedda garrison during last days of King Ali. Left for Egypt in 1927. An associate of Tahir ad-Dabbagh in anti-Sa’udi activities abroad. At instance of Sa’udi authorities was required to leave India in 1933. Subsequently travelled in Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine. Returned with Tahir to Sa’udi Arabia under the amnesty of 1935 and in 1936 was made successively Assistant Director of Auqaf and Director of the Census. Reported to be a man of integrity. 67. Seyyid Muhammad Shata. Younger brother of Salih ibn Abu Bakr Shata (No. 49). Born about 1908. Holder of an Egyptian degree in religious law. Inspector in the Ministry of Education. In 1935 member of an unofficial delega tion for the collection of Waqf moneys in various Islamic countries and India, which did not, however, leave this country. In 1936 appointed Inspector of Sharia’ Courts. 68. Muhsin at Tayyeb. Moroccan by origin. Born about 1887. Held police appointments under the Hashimite regime. Under Ibn Sa’ud he was similarly employed. Promoted at the beginning of 1936 from a post in the Sa’udi police to be secretary and A.D.C. to the Deputy Minister for Defence. Attached as liaison officer to the British R.A.C. training unit which arrived in Taif in May 1944 to instruct the Sa’udi army in the handling of armoured cars presented to the Sa’udi Arabian Government by His Majesty’s Government. An intriguer who is not popular with his colleagues and who in September 1944 was replaced by a younger officer. In 1947 described as an army inspector. He sits in the War Ministry at Taif and acts as a staff officer (Q) for the Minister of Defence. Has a knowledge of French and served in the Turkish army. A suspicious, crafty, clever and unlikeable man who loves intrigue and is generally unpopular. Has some knowledge of military matters but has never seen a military unit since 1918 when he fought in Syria against us. He has made little attempt to hide his dislike of the British military mission. It is believed that he fought in the Balkan War, with King Hussein and, later, joined Ibn Saud when the Hejaz w r as captured. He is said to have been employed formerly by the King as an informer and, possibly for this reason, may still be suspected. 69. Najib Ibrahim Sdlhd. Of Syrian origin, educated at the American College, Beirut. Born probably about 1902. Came in 1927 to the Hejaz via the Sudan, where em- 34901 Eployed for a short time by Gellatly, Hankey and Company (Sudan) Limited. After a short but troubled period of service with that firm in Jedda, he entered the Ministry of Finance. Speaks English well and has an easy manner. Made himself useful to the Minister of Finance, whose secretary he became. In 1936 placed in charge of a newly-created department of the Ministry of Finance, styled the “ Office of Public Works,” established to deal with the growing number of foreign concerns holding con cessions in Sa’udi Arabia. By 1939 he had estab lished himself in the confidence of Abdullah Sulainian to the detriment of Muhammad Sunir, was employed as purchasing agent for the Govern ment, and was enriching himself almost openly by bribery and commissions. Became indispensable to the Minister of Finance and was specially commis sioned by the King to deal with supply matters, but found it difficult to exercise his functions without much interference from Yusuf Yasin. After the out break of war he was in constant contact with the legation and showed himself intelligent and frank. He worked very hard and co-operated most helpfully with the legation in the endeavour to organise the provisioning and finances of the country. Was free in his criticism of the ignorance and incompetence of most of the members of the Sa’udi Government and made many enemies but was loyally backed by ’Abdullah al Suleyman, and was probably the most efficient of all the King’s servants. He was said to have enriched himself but this is scarcely remarkable in a country where emoluments are certain of payment only if the official is in a position to help himself. Although he abstains from tobacco and alcohol he makes no pretence of being a Wahhabi or even a very devout Moslem. Early in 1944 evidence came to light which showed him in his true colours. It was found that he had made use of his position to enrich himself, and one of his associates in crime now estimates his personal fortune at £360,000, in addition to a handsome account in the Guaranty Trust Bank of New York. It transpires that he had deliberately misinformed the legation about the true supply and financial situation of the country in order to ensure the continuance of His Majesty’s Government’s generous assistance to Sa’udi Arabia and thereby to increase his own fortune. When in Cairo early in 1944 he began intriguing with the Americans, whom he had always sought to play off against the British, and warned His Majesty’s Minister that the Sa’udi Arabian Government would ask for his recall if he were not more complacent over the matter of supplies and finance. Ibn Sa’ud, who learned of Najib’s activities, was furious and dismissed him in April, in spite of strong pressure from Abdullah Suleiman and Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. telling His Majesty’s Minister that he had always disliked Najib and had only kept him on because he enjoyed British support. He is at present (July 1944) in Cairo, where he has started a transport company. Ibn Sa’ud. always generous to those that have served him, is said to be paying him a ” retaining fee.” His place as Director of the Office of Public Works at Jedda was taken by Tzzet Din Shawa (No. 34). Najib remains in Egypt, where he acts as unofficial agent of the Sa’udi Royal Family, and is in close touch with Yusuf Yasin and his associates. He has acquired valuable house property in Cairo, for which he has paid about half a million pounds. He is busy trying to obtain the agencies of American cars and is a partner of Ibrahim Shakir (q.v.) in the Sa’ftdi Arab Trading Company formed in January 1945. Continues (June 1946) to reside in Cairo, posing as Saudi purchasing agent. His name stinks in British and United States Disposals Board nostrils because he is known to have been assisted to acquire vehicles, Sic., on Saudi Government priority and to have sold them to Egyptian purchasers privately, at large personal profit, within 24 hours. 70. Sa'ud ibn 'Abdullah ibn Jiluwi. Appointed Governor of Hasa upon the death of his father in October 1935. Born about 1900. Made an unfavourable general impression on Sir Andrew Ryan, who was received by the new Amir at Hofuf with a singular lack of ordinary Arab politeness, in December 1935. Described as repulsive in appear ance owing to a super-squint. Reported from Bahrein to take an even stronger line with the Bedouin than his father did, and that much of the father’s work in the last four years of his life was, in fact, done by the son. Shows nervousness in the presence of foreigners, but this can be overcome. In 1938 it was reported that his powers were being curtailed by the King, and that troops not under his control were to be quartered at Hofuf. Maintains his “ court ” on an almost Royal scale and appears now to enjoy Ibn Sa’ud’s confidence. Whether he would remain loyal to the King in all circumstances is not certain. 71. Sand ibn Hedhlul. Appointed Governor of Tabtik in 1936 in succes sion to ’Abdullah as-Sidayri (No. 50 (1)). Reported from Transjordan to have made a popular start, partly by recruiting his bodyguard locally, a departure which created a favourable impression. 72. Tala at Wafa. ^ Born about 1900 in the Hejaz. In 1934 member of Sa’udi boundary commission for the Yemen- Sa’udi frontier after the conclusion of the Treaty of Taif. Police official of importance, being Director for the Provinces of Asir and Najran, and O.C. regular forces in Najran and Abha in 1936. Appointed Deputy Director of Public Security in 1943 and Director of Police, Jedda, in 1947. 73. Ibrahim Tdsdn. A Nejdi born and brought up in Asir. Formerly in the Ottoman army. Now Commandant of the Jedda military district and “ Director of the Air Force.” Served in the Arab army of Sharif Hussein and was associated with Colonel Lawrence. An extremely pleasant and entirely harmless individual with a sense of humour but little military ability. Has been most forthcoming as far as the British Military Mission is concerned, but lacks initiative and has long ago reached his limit. 74. A s'ad al Faqih. A native of ’Aley, in the Lebanon. Coun sellor to the Sa’udi Legation in Bagdad in 1938. Afterwards charge d’affaires and appointed in 1943 to be minister there. Has some knowledge of English, and speaks French well. Member of the Sa’udi delegation to the San Francisco Conference in April 1945. Became first Saudi Minister in Wash ington, December 1945. 75. Khalil Hajjan. Late Director of Police, Jedda. Formerly in Turkish army. Captured by the British during the Great War, but volunteered to join the Sharifian forces. Joined Ibn Sa’ud after the fall of Jedda in 1925. A heavy drinker. Appointed Director of Police, Medina, in 1947. 76. Khuraiji, Shaikh Muhammad aT. Father-in-law to Shaikh Abdullah Sulaiman, to whose influence is attributed the fact that he has become the wealthiest man in Medina. 77. Sa'd ibn Faisal. Governor of Duwadmi, 1938. Born about 1898. Son of a Royal slave.1 21 78. Shaikh al Ardh. Family name of two Syrians, brothers. The elder, Midhat, who is doctor of the Royal ladies, accompanied the Crown Prince to England for the Silver Jubilee. He came to Riyadh as a penniless refugee and is known to have become rich in a few years, not by doctoring. Stated on very good evidence to have brought with him from Syria as maid to his wife an Armenian girl (entered on his passport as his sister) and to have handed over the I unwilling girl to Ibn Sa’ud as a concubine. Accompanied the Amir Mansur on a visit to Egypt in March 1942. The younger brother, Fakhri, who describes t A i himself as an agricultural expert, was in charge of a small experimental garden at Riyadh in 1939, and was also employed that year as Courier to Paris. Fakhri was appointed first secretary to the Sa’udi Legation in Baghdad in 1942 and trans ferred in 1943 as first Sa’udi Consul to Basra. Midhat was dismissed by the King in July 1943 but later reinstated at the request of Yusuf Yasin (q.v.) and other Syrians in the Sa’udi Government. 79. Shaikho, Muhammad. A young Syrian formerly in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Accompanied the Amir Sa’ud to the United Kingdom in 1935 for the Silver Jp^^^ilee. Sent to the Yemen in 1937 to sign various agreements on behalf of the Sa’udi Government. Assisted Yusuf Yasin in negotiating the Sa’udi- Koweit Agreements at Jedda in 1940-42. Appointed private secretary to the Amir Mansur in February 1945. 80. Yusuf ibn 'Abdullah al Fauzan. Formerly lived in Bombay, where he acted as unofficial agent for Ibn Sa’ud. Appointed consul- general at Jerusalem in February 1941. An intelli gent young man with pleasing manners. Speaks English well. Replaced in Jerusalem, 1945. Cairo in the summer of 1946, and his application to visit his home was welcomed by them and approved by Ibn Sa’ud. He now spends much time in Egypt. 82. Ndsir ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Aqil. Director of Finance at Jedda. A cousin of Ibrahim al Suleyman ibn ’Aqil. 83. Suleyman Nainih. Director of Coastguards. A Nejdi, like nearly all the rest of the service. Friendly and helpful. Dismissed in May 1944 for incompetence in dealing with the smuggling of gold from the Hejaz, but was reinstated shortly after. 84. A bdul 'Aziz ibn Fawzdn. Manager of the Royal garage at Riyadh. A Koweiti by origin who claims, although it is not known on what grounds, to be a British subject. Said to have served with the British Red Cross in Iraq during the war of 1914-18. A fat, sly, talkative man. He likes strong drink and has an inexhaustible fund of humorous reminiscences and anecdotes. During the Yemen war he was in charge, under the Amir Sa’ud, of the Saudi army’s mechanised transport. Although not likely to become a figure of political importance he is worth mentioning as being on intimate terms with the King and his advisers and as having proved from time to time that he has a pretty accurate knowledge of what goes on in the King’s councils. He is much in contact with the Amir Mansur who frequents the garage. Appointed Deputy Minister of Defence in December 1944 but resigned in January 1945, owing, according to him, to the intrigues of Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. Seems to be genuine in his dislike of the latter as of the rest of the Syrian gang whose influence in the government of the country he constantly deplores. Headed a Purchasing Mission to Cairo, to acquire Disposals Board materials, May 1946. ' 81. Bashir as-Sa'ddwi. A Tripolitan, believed to be related to Khalid a: Qarqani (q.v.). Like Khalid, fought against the Italians. In 1939 used by Ibn Sa’ud as emissary in Syria and was present at all but the most confidential talks between the King and His Majesty’s Minister at Riyadh. Holds no definite post but ranks as one *4^he King’s advisers. Talks Turkish in addition ®*o Arabic but no European language. Was not much -in evidence during His Majesty’s Minister’s visit to Riyadh in March 1942, nor during his visits to the King in the spring of 1944. Accompanied Ibn Sa’ud to Egypt in February 1945 for the meetings with President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill. He was sent to Damascus in February 1946, after accompanying Ibn Saud on the state visit to Egypt, to act as His Majesty’s spokesman to the Syrian President on various issues. He was one of the advisers accom panying the Amir Saud to Inshass, May 1946. He especially cultivates the Amir Saud, and seeks to instruct and develop him. His presence in Tripoli seemed useful to the Civil Affairs authorities in 85. Sharif Mohsin, Qaid. Chief of Staff. A husseini trained in the Military College at Bagdad who rose to the rank of captain in the Iraqi army. Born about 1897. An excep tionally keen and comparatively efficient officer with considerable personality and intelligence. Has plenty of initiative and ideas but holds the Minister of Defence in such awe that he will not give a decision on even unimportant routine matters before consulting him. He is a hard worker and is anxious to learn. Is at present studying English with the British Military Mission and attends the minor tactics courses and exercises as a student.
