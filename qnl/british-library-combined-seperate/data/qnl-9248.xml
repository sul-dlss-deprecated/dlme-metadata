The additional reservations, which largely covered uncultivated, but also some cultivated land, were required for refinery installation, pipeline and road rights of way, and drilling and operating water wells.The papers include letters of application from BAPCO, describing the additional reservations required; blueprints (folios 12, 18, 23, 27); and correspondence from the Political Agent, Bahrain forwarding the applications to the Government of Bahrain.The file also contains a description of lands privately owned by Shaikh Sir Hamad Bin Issa Al Khalifah [Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah] outside the municipal boundaries of Manama and Muharraq (folios 48-50), and a survey of the municipal boundaries of Manama and Muharraq (folios 42-50). These were confirmed as correct by the Shaikh in a letter in Arabic, with English translation (folio 39).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Oil refineries</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Bahrain Ḥamad bin 'Īsá Āl Khalīfah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Bahrain</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a2#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a2#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
