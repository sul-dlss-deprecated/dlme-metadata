The scale is basest more or less on the articles of furniture supplied to the clerical staff of Messrs Cable and Wireless Ltd., Bahrain. The Indian staff of the A.I.O.C., I understand, are supplied furniture oh a much higher scale. Two nawar (or iron) beds, one dressing table / ~ h . one dining table 4 dining chairs -— one dinner wagon one meat safe, one stove two wicks one ice chest, one water filter, one writing desk 4 tea-poys one wardrobe six drav/ing room chairs. - t ' two table fans, two easy chairs, two durrees. two commodes. I suggest only one scale for all the clerks as !nore or less the requirements of all the staff coming from India are practically the same, whether they work in the Lower Grade, Upper Grade or Special Division. It would of course be greatly appreciated if the Selection Grade clerks are given a pair of settees for drawing room as usually theyL- r entertain on higher scale and have also to keep their position vis-a-vis senior clerks of Bapco, who of course draw a higher rate of salary. At present the staff hardly have any furniture of their own. Not being able to pay for the furniture they usually borrow from friends wo are either on leave or transfer, and the same furniture passes from one hand to another. Some of them however have given lists of their furniture which are given below:- 'H (a) Head Clerk .(Mr. Ras Masaud). ^ Nawar beds two v Ordinary bed one. ^ one dining table ^4 dining chairs.

The proposal was to start supplying furniture from the Head Clerk down to the other Agency clerks, but what actually happened was that each clerk was provided with certain articles of furniture which were necessary at the time fo^ his immediate needs. The stock of articles of furniture then purchase^ and its present distribution is given on the attached list. In the meantime the staff of Agency has further increased by two temporary clerks(Mr.Menien and Mr.Souza) and the third one may be expected shortly. The proposal made in March 1942,§erteined to fnojL- the permanent staff only and it was not at time forecast V that the strength of the Agency staff will be increased by the exegencies of war. Owing to the various changes that occured in the /gency staff from October 1341,and the departureof focjor /Iban,0,F.E.,from Lehrein,till the return of Mr.Retbanifwho has nov^ re-opened the question) the proposal of supplying furniture to the clerks in accordance with the scale remained in abeyance. /t present distribution of furniture to the . , avoid clerks is not on &amp; uniform^scale and to/complaints of this nature it is considered necessary that each clerk should have furniture on a uniform scale. It is suggested that at present the fillo'ing furniture which is considered absolutely necessary for each clerk should be provided:- Cot l(for single) 2(for married) Chairs 6. Fan 1.

You are probably arare that the Telegraph Staff are given furnished Quarters throughout the Gulf and recently a month ago some furniture Fas made here for their addition staff.
