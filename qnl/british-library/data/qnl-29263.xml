Dear Mr. Ballantjne, Many thanks for your letter of 20th November about the Bahrein li^htbuoy, a copy of which is being sent to the Government of India. 2. As regards the position of the lightship, we understand that it is proposed to place it in the position on the ten fathom line which was originally suggested for the outer buoy of the Company's proposed approach to Khor Khaliya, (viz. latitude 26° 31' N., longitude 50° 59$' E.)• The above position is described as being 22 miles from the outer lightbuoy of Bahrein and 32 miles from the proposed oiling berth, a direct course leading to each. Yours sincerely, J.G. LAITHWAITE. H.R. Ballantyne, Esq., Bahrein petroleum Co.Ltd., 19, Moorgate, E.C. 2.uUr i &gt;yr P.Z.7144/34. THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED. 19, Lborgate, London, 2.C. 2. 20th Novemher 1934. Dear Mr. Laithwaite, I have received instructions to reply to your letter p.z.5916/34 of the 26th September. As I informed you at our meeting on Friday last, the Company note, with pleasure, that the Government of India have ordered a Lightship for Banrein Harbour for the Persian Gulf lighting service and that when this Lightship is placed in the position in which it is at present proposed to put it, the Lightbuoy required by the Bahrein petroleum Company Limited will no longer be necessary. Assuming, as the Company do, that when the Lightship is in position it will not be necessary any longer for the Company to maintain the Lightbuoy at present on loan to them, the Company will then be able to return it. perhaps you could indicate to me some time, the precise position it is intended the Lightship snail occupy? In the meantime, I am instructed to ask you to thank the Government of India for its kindly offer of the Lightbuoy which, it is observed, is a new one, and to say that if, in the events which might happen, it is desirable for the Company to have a Lightbuoy, they will be pleased to accept the offer of the Government to retain the Lightbuoy at present on loan to them. As you assume, it is not the wish of the Company to proceed, at present, with the proposal to provide a new buoy. Yours sincerely, J,G.Laithwaite, Esq., H.R. BALLANTYNE.

Dear Captain Edgell', - A semi-official lettepfcy Air Mail seems the best way of telling you about the situation here. The instructions for the work arrived a.m. Monday 12th February, being in a mail received from POWEY on her way from Bahrain to Henjam, at a rendezvous off Nabiyu Tunb. I had left Henjam the previous evening to carry on with the main survey and but for orders from the S.N.o # that night to send the Doctor ashore to the A#P«0«C. oil field at Ras Tarkun where there had been an accident I should have been down off Bu Musa landing a triangulation party and so some way south of FOWEY’s course. As it happened I could not have received the instructions at a more opportune moment being complete with coal and having only one party ashore - that at Nabiyu Tunb, being landed when POWEY was sighted; further it was rather important to be back at Henjam about 1st March when our store ship arrives, a variety of provisions being very low. Anyhow we were on our way to Bahrain by 1100 though a shamal springing up in the middle watch t hat night out oi as comolete a calm as could be and reaching force 7 with a beastly sea'the next day, prevented our arrival on the survey area till noon on Wednesday, 14th. Thenceforward all went well, a spell of finecalm weather lasting exactly long enough until completion of the sounding p.m. Thursday 22nd. Next day another strong shamal arrived but I was able to land from an anchorage off the entrance to Khor Kaliya and delivered the tracing to the B.P.C. The sounding done was rather more than the check lines and quite sufficient I think to say that the channel is clear for a ship drawing 32 feet, the presence of any undiscovered sudden shoals being unlikely from the even nature of the bottom which only varies 12 feet over most of the area. Messrs. Deacon, Skinner &amp; Nelson lunched with me at an anchorage in Bahrain Harbour on Saturday 17th and from them I learnt of the proposed buoyage of which I had also happened to hear a few details from,the S.N.O. our last week-end at Henjam, but before we knew of our job.Hearing that the NEARCHUS of Basrah Port Authority would he laying the buoys in the near future and observing that the two outer positions were well out of sight of land I got the B.P.C. to construct two mark buoys which Captain Nelson met the ship with last Wednesday evening. He was taken out and transferred at the outer end of the channel to the EL SEGUNDO who ha^ened to arrive on the Thursday. I then laid the two mark buoys accurately in positions for the outer buoys to be, my idea being that it seemed such a pity to lose such positions and that without such mark buoys the NEARCHUS, presumably on star sights, might be a mile or more out with the result that the tankers might ply quite a different channel to that sounded. I am uncertain whose is the responsibility for assigning the final positions for the buoys nor could the B.P.C. help me yesterday. They said however that they would send a blue print of my tracing by Air Mail to Hamilton, their representative in London, in the event of the decision on buoy positions having to be made there. Meanwhile the S.N.O. being at Basrah I have informed him of the existence of the mark buoys and asked him to inform the Port Authority, so that they may if they wish take advantage of them. Perhaps it is too much to hope. The second mark buoy has been laid about 4 miles 206° from its proposed position half way down the channel, in order to guard a 33 feet shoal to the eastward of it. This was the shoalest water found. My main reason for writing Air Mail is to acquaint you of the possibility of your being shown a blue print of our work before the official tracing is received. The latter is in hand but it is not proposed to send it Air Mail. This is being our worst shamal. The visibility is 2 to 3 miles and the wind a very good force 7. Our anchorage about 1 mile east of Kassar Diwan rock is however sheltered^nd preferable to Bahrain harbour. Doubt if the wind can last long at such strength and I hope to be able to recover beacons on Monday and return to the Main Survey. I shall be able to check whether the mark buoys have dragged though they are well anchored. I have a provisional idea of remaining in the Gulf until Friday 13th April td make the time on the main survey long enough to be worth while but that is about the limit of our coal supply. I shall try not to expect to achieve too much as it is doubtful if we shall get the required clear weather. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) A.

In view of the decision of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited to ship oil to the extent of seven hundred tons a day by July 1st, 1934, (nineteen thirty-four) traffic (both the carriage of materials and supplies for the workers) is likely to increase and I hope that it will be possible to hasten the provision of the Lightshin for Bahrain Harbour. 3. It is, moreover, to our interest to increase the facilities offered by the Bahrain Harbour as quickly as possible in order to prevent, or at any rate postpone, the establishment of a oort on the mainland. If the Standard Oil Comnany of California find oil in Hasa, they will naturally have to make terminal arrangements on the main land for shipping oil. ^hey are now, however, only at the beginning of their operations and I hope,also,that if they find the Bahrain harbour offers marked facilities for deal ing with traffic they may prefer to avoid helping to create a comnrrcial port on the mainland.

The Director added that it was desired to proceed with the erection of this 1 ught at an early date, and asked me to inform the Persian auinorities. 2. In reply I informed the Port Director that I should have to refer the matter to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and that I personally considered it very im probable that the Persian Government would agree to it, or that His Majesty’s Minister would consider this an opportune moment at which to appro/deih them in the matter, aud I a sked for a full statement of the reasons for this light. Colonel 7 »rd has now sent me copies of some corraspondence on the subject including a letter U 0 . 6 -P &amp; L (9) 31 of the 1st August 19 31 from the Government of India in the Department of Commerce to the Flag Officer Commanding and Director Royal Indian Marine, Bombay, according their sanction to this work. 3 # The proposal for a modification of the lights at Henjam was originally made by the senior Mav&amp;l Officer two years ago in his letter Ho. 159 of the 5th August J9 30. Since that time, however, the position at Henjam has radically INDIA FOREIGN SECP ■* - ’ etter No '125 changed, and I have recently discussed this matter *ith the Dated 8 SEP 1932 Recer. ‘26SEP.' 1 ' ' Senior.... ±Senior Naval officer, who has teen on a short visit to Bushire. As the Govermient of India are aware, the position &amp;t Henjam at the present tirie is one of considerable delicacy and uncertainty. There is a possibility that the Naval base at HCnjam may have to be transferred elsewhere; if so it is obviously undesirable to incur any more expenditure on the provision of facilities there. In any case the whole question of Hen jam is at present under discussion with the Persian Government, and it seems to me most undesirable and most inopportune at the present time to seek any further facilities from them. The senior Naval Officer, at whose instance this additional light is being provided, entirely concurs in these views and is of opinion that the matter is hot one of great urgency and may well stand over until a definite decision has been arrived at regarding Henjaaw I would therefore suggest that the matter anauld remain in abeyance for the time being 4 . in conclusion I would suggest that before sanction of the Government of India is accorded to the provision of additional lights, buoys, etc. in the Persian Gulf, the opinion of the Political Resident might be ascertained, juju since these matters frequently have political reactions.
