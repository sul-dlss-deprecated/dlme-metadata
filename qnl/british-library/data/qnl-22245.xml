One of the main problems is to pet the hanun ail to ,ether in one place on ,one dap and the early arrival pet tmed of wait inf for the later ones. 73.

Ubeid denied that he had ever sipned the truce and Anr bin Awa&amp;l seemed inclined to believe him. The matter was later referred to I Tup add a; is a copy of the letter which Ubeid.

It does not need to be proved that they replenished their ammunition supply there because they would not be satisfied until Ubeid Saleh had yiven them some. It is also not at all improba' le that lie pave them some encour aye men t to loot on the Seiyun Tarim section of the road and assured then that Government could not take action ayainst them. This follows closely on the visit of the F.A.R.A. to Ghurfa (see 8S)duriny which the suspicion of trmid Saleh’s activities in trying to prevent to prevent the Hamum cominy to terms with Government'were conveyed to him, ■ On the day of the fiyht the Olerk Seiyun intended to visit Ghurfa t akiny with him a letter'from the R,A, and the Bond for him to siyn and conveyiny to him the yood news that if he siyned he would be permitted to remain for a further period in the Hadhramaut. The Clerk went to Ghurfa since it wa s unlikely that Ubeid Saleh would have heard of the affair and there appeared no danyer of reprisals beiny taken at such an early staye after the fiyht. It also seemed a yood moment to find out whether there was any reaction in Ghurfa to the incident, 186, \ Ubeid Saleh did not siyn the documents, the-contents of which had been air ady explained to him carefully duriny a visit by the clerk three da^s previously on the yrounds that the new Governor, with whom rested the decision about Ubeid’s yood behaviour since May 1840 would be influenced ayainst him by his many enemies n which did not yive Ubeid a fair chance. He expressed his pleasure and yratitude at the efforts made on his behalf and asked to sec the F.A.R.A, in order to discuss with him the matter which he described as beiny for him :{ one of life or death”. It seems certain that at the time of this visit he had no news of the Uneizat . icident* The F.A.R,A. intends to yive Ubeid Saleh a few more days in which to.think matters over and then to pay him a third visit, 187, The normal W/T inspection by the R,A.F. happened at a most opportune moment occurriny on the day after the Hamum fiyht 'so that most of the local people were of the opinion that matters had been so arranyed. Their landiny was somewhat complicated by three factors. The Seiyun Wireless Station was in bad receiviny condition, the road situation between Seiyun and Ghuraf was uncertain, steady r ain had fallen on the previous niyht. ' However all turned out well except that the R.A.F. had to walk thropyh mud from Ghuraf to Tariba where the cars had stuck. Owiny to a wrong diagnosis of the complaint of the wireless messages have still to be recieved on a private receiver pending the arrival of grid batteries which are thought to be on the way* 188. Rain has been 'loot welcome and it gives one an insight into the minds of those living in a parched country to notice the uplift its arrived brings to the local people and to watch the children splashing happily a' out in the pools left by it and the women washing their clothes in them.

The great difficulty is always the every one is so scared of reprisals (even twenty years ahead) that they will never dare to bear witness and regard perjury in a very different light from a European country. 190, It is reported that Al Tania have helad a general •meeting of the tribe at which they have decided to insist on trie -ooll-^c-t-ion of 'Shain* and ’Al Harf’ and to disregard the orders of the Qu’aiti government.

By prompt action, such as has been taken in this affair, it is generally possi le to nip Hadhramaut wars, always very slow to start in spite of alarmist talk, in the bud. The onlj^ disquieting news of the affair is that Bin Aj^aj, failing to have confidence in Mukalla support and because the land is rapidly drying, is rumoured to have made or be about to make an agreement with bin Thabit which probably would exclude the Mukalla Government from interference in the land and which would be most unfortunate from Government point of view. Steps have been taken to assure Bin Ajjaj that assistance is coming at once. 2Q 93* The Seiyun postal runner has been'intecopted by a band of Hamum, probably returning from Ghurfa, at Al Jilda above Madi Shu huh nos far from .Seiyun* owing to igne The mail bag was opened but smbe on the part of the B e du as to its contents and the assurance’ of the runner that he was on his way to Wadi binAli not Seiyun, the consenss was not tampered with.

Whether in peace of tine of trouble with the Mamun thrue entrances into the Wadi must always be carefully wot cued and'tho'ogb trio is poroiblo on the stretch between geiyun ana ^it is not pessibie at present to take any steps to prevent them coming to Ghurfa.

Tne truth is that the above seems to be one of the rare incidents of which Ubcid was probably ignorant unt.l afi’ci' it had hapuehed,- 294, (184) The casualties of the enemy at Unoizat have not been confirmed nor is it likely that they ever will as the Hamum always taxe steps to remove their dead, strip them of their worldly possess ton and abandon them to natural decay under some rocks on the djolc The wounded soldier in 3hubam is progressing satisfactorily. It is reported from a reliable source- that the Hamumi wounded were cared for in Ghurfa and that one may still be there* 295 0 (186) The F.A«R A,, paid a further visit to Ubeid Saleh* It was not a success* ubud did his best to side track the main issue of she Bond by a complaint about the passports of the Bin Kudda being stopped and this incident reported below has gone deep with Ubeid Saleh who has obviously been blamed by Bin Kudda for what has happened. When the talk did reach the point the same old complaints were raised about the decision of his behaviour resting with His Bxcollcncy. It wa s necessary to4 remind Ifboid that he was not negotiating with Government hut Government wore make concession to him of an extremely generous kind. He then said that the trouble was that the English phraseology of the Bond corld not he understood even in translation by an Arab, A deadlock was reached and it was then suggested that he might draft a Bond in Arab style but with a smiilar meaning and this was done on the following day.. It was an into roe ting document and had a very different meaning as it contained clauses about his right to defend himself against aggression etc. which has always been the excuse for anything Uboid Saleh has ever done/ The F,A,R.A. was subjected to a number of small indignities during his visit which even allowing for Ubeid Saleh's abnormalities showed that things were nrt making good progress. The general atmosphere of the discussions was outwardly pleasant enough and the usual or coll out ‘iunc.h wrss f. alren T+. i « 1 i 1rr»T tr +Vto&lt;f- and the usual excellent lunch was taken, Ubeid was seriously perin: ed by the Unc iz; It is likely that iction and the response oia. 113 ^ win cm may eventually be pinned on liiny 296. The ’eras of Hms Barakar to negotiate in the Manaliil-Bin Yemani dispute on behalf of the Mukalla Go Vermont have not yet. proved success:bi- Ho has received u letter from Mugaddam Bidha bin Hrriz bin Tannaf of the Manahil ompha** sizing that ‘the protection of the roads was undertaken to'be maintained by the British Government as stated in a previous proclamation* and that Bin Yemani has committed many offences against road safery including building a fort on •chc road,, He demai-ds the arrest of the murderer of the Llanah.il or else he w5.ll take the law into his own hands. This kind of threat is very frequent-and it is difficult tv U i i i G. iu vJ G il. O &gt;030021 realise that Government is constandly at work to settle all cases but that eveiyth^.ng takes tinio, ’Tlie- cause of the original incident was partly that the kananil collected certain illegal taxes from the people of 3cm and partly that the Manahil having refused to allow the Belyids of Tarim and Soiyun to go to the Hud Fair without paying escort foes, Bin Yemani refused to allow the Mahah.il to pass through his village of Qasm wlif.-re ho lives. It appears x-aut tr- Kanah.il are considerably more to blame for the pres- -nt : feeling in • wl Oii^. bet\.’ - on the two tribes but the aifricuioy is that rhoru appears some uncertainty of the extent erf control of the Mukalla Government over the Malic.ill, If it. is only possible to arrange a meeting between the two Hue ad dams and Be is Baraka: something may be done but at present Bj-. ± Yemcmj. ..s 'vex-^y sxxy as suspe c^s Gove mien w may arrest him for the part ho played in the killing of the Manahil* 297^ Settlement between the Seiyids and Kashcikh in Hautat Ahmed bin Zein has not been reached and the work of the Sciyun Seiyids appears biased in the direction of clericalism,, The old. Mansab Umar bin Abdulla lias announced his resignation. The reasons are not clear and the local Seiyids here do not show much wish to discuss it which leads one to believe that he has found his position as a just man incompatible with his position as leader of the clerical party, He has also suffered cruelly from the poisoned tongue; al opponents who actually accuse him of selling Ai Hauta to the British Government by a series of monthly instalments of two hundred dollars. On the surface the whole dispute appears trivial but unfortunatoly both sides seek support from local tribesmen which complicates the affair. The fickleness of Ubeid Saleh is very evident. He is an admitted 1 Irshadi* but in this case he is throwing in his lot with the Seiyids because he considers them the more powerful as having greaser influence over the tribes than the mesheikh. It is rumoured that he has told the Hamum in Ghurfa to stand by ponding orders to occupy Hautat Ahmed bin Zein. 5 hc rumour should be trea ted lightly as he would never dare to do such a thing but in one of his frequent expansive moment# he has doubtless spread such a story to see if Government will make a protest. Efforts at local nett lenient continue but it scorns doubtful if am/thi: g srtisinclsor/ will happen until Ubeid Saleh's case is ..oetu-i-^ finally one way or another. /5 298, (292)Troops from IInl'allc have arrived in Haura and events have* talccn a swift and satisfactory turn., A letter was sent to Al Hakim Mubarak to ascertain his attitude as the rumour that he had made an agreement with Bin Thabit, to the exclusion of Government, was confirmed. His reply, as Seiyid Bubakr expressed it, gave one a f holiday feeling 1 » Bin Ajd^j had apparently met the officer commanding the troops as soon as they arrived, prompt! ■ broke his agreement with Bin Thabit and side by side his tribesm~i. and Government troops occupies positions on tho mountain above Muheiniq, which recently had been in tho hands of Al Thabit, Cultivation then proceeded. All this without a shot being fired and only a strong protest being made by Bin Thabit to Hukalla, It therefore appears that the Muhciniq. incident is settled and it only remain for the Mukalla envoys to arrive and gu into the far from' easy question of rights on the half of the land not in tho posse ssion of Bin Ajjkj* Besides this if the present situation can bo consolidated there will be a substantial and regular sotr ce of revenue for the Mukalla Government from the Huheiniq land, 299, Two facts of the greatest importance emerged from correspondence of Al Hakim Mubarak to Seiyid Bubakr, The first was a spontaneous offer to Government to erect forts at strategic points in the vicinity of Muheiniq which was remarkable coming as it did before any overtures aad been made to Bin Ajjaj on this essential matter. Without.his agreement there would bo no possible means of Government building as the influence of Al Hakim is very great and he has a large triban following not only of Hahd, These gorts do not mean merely the protection of Muheiniq land but the covering of all the Western approaches to the most important pojPt of the valley. The control of ammunition smuggling would be simplified and' if at any time ,t was required to tax goods arriving from the Yemen, and the r^evone . from this source will be considerable, these forts would provide bases from which the work could be carried out, Al Hakim also suggested that Government should take steps to control the smuggling of mimu.nitj.on and as he holds the key to this at Qa’udha it is most significant. Just before he wrote the letter two boxes arrived from tie Yemen which ho promptly bout in order that the Government soldiers and his own tribal irregulars might use them in the defence of Muhoiniq 0 He has expressed a wish to have a talk with Fa A* Id A.- end it is hoped that this can be arranged aw some perotica! uggistious far maintenance of security on the roads and elsewhere might result. 300c *hq question of the collection of Pate and House Ta x in the Kathiri .State has been discussed in Council as the result of the decisions made by the Resident Advisor at his recent meeting with His Excellency in Aden, During thv past year the matter hag frequently been under discussion but one excuse after another was put forward in opposition to such taxation which admittedly will not bring in substantial revenue (at least until there is sufficient armed force to enable the taxes to bo collected from tho Shonafir tribes) but which when balanced by the collection of an exit tax on goods loaxing tho ports for tho interior will produce the necessary State revenue and at tho same time will be a signal of administrative submission to the Suit are When the Resident to suonoct Adviser 1 s te 1 ograil,was rocc 1 ved and some firmness by thdsjih A, JR, A c the mooting members demanding to know whore tho audit to have a. ddod to the Customs in order peace had gone.

The F.A.R.A* promised to take up die matter of Customs increase and its purpose with the Resident fdv-is. r end to have an explanation given and he’ said ho ’e; rv ■ the Rosidenu Advise.' would carefully consider and -onward to Aden any reasonable petitions,~ 6 - although ho warned Council that the. technical objections to tho inposition ox the tajc had already boon i’oiw/ard.od and considered, ho administrative valtK. of tho proposed taxation v/as also stressed* The- question was then raised as to whether it was understood that at present the ourdon would 1 all onl 3 ? ’ on tlio townsmen ox Seiyun and Tarim and the reply was that this was understood hut that as the money came in and as the security forces could be- built uo so the taxation would bo-extended, it was then ashed if a proposed reduction on present taxation would be considered to which the reply was that this_depended entirely on the amount of revenue rccuired for the adtministration but that wt v/as the dut^^ - of Government to soothat incidence was fairly placed. After considerable discussion during which Sciyid xjubalir slasned at the unwillingness of PadhrsextB to assist their country 1 s progress it was agreed to approve-'the taxation in principle out to roouost that it should not be nut into exccimtion until His Excellency had received, considered and' replied to certain comments which the- local people wished to make. A committee to do this consisting of Seiyid Huhammad bin Kashim, Sciyid Alawi bin Abdulla and Seiyid ga Ich A1 Kamdi was then annointed after Sciyid Bubakr had declined to sit. The text of a'tolegrara to be sent to the Resident Adviser was then drafted arfl signed Various points of interest are shown by the above. The Sultan worried both about his own Civil List and about the bankruptcy of his State did not dare to open Ms mouth as he might well have do no in defence of such a plan. The .reason that the royal family is completely dominated by the ruling class of Soiyids and both Soiyid Alawi and Soiyid 3alch ? members of the Council, are exempt by ancient family custom xi-om paying; any dues no the otato and should certainly not bo exempt * men there was an underlying objection with which Soiyia BuLcikr was in. agroeturt ? To the Arab it is one tiling to give a charity payment to the State or an individual (i.e. Zikat) qpito another to givo a regular and forced payment. Being fully aware that their country is not able to run on air they do not have great objection to paying an indirect tax. but a direct tax Is a different matter. At all events the Seiyun Government has at least agreed in principle to the taxation so it is therefore not necessary to use the extreme clause in the Advisor Treaty bu the assessment and collection of the tax will not be easy. The resist tance within Sciyun and Tarim will be passive but widespread. How soon the taxes could be collected from the Shanafir Confederation depends entirely on the local armed force that can be built up as there will certainly be more than passive resistance from its members, Z C1 v (195) IIcre dot Ali bin Kathir incident* .a are now to hand about the Aw amir ** was connected with the incident that occurred in fa.-riir..an wren some I.ahra, accompanied by two Al Aii bin Katnir, raided an Amiri of the- Hat at aba section at Annoid* Al Ali bin no-.Ciiii •.'v-i.o live on one ocigc l-j. ^ia-ii-a counery freeuontly travel wibh bhe-ru and uiay almost oc regarded as part of the tribe* Sultan Llunannad Din nulls in had made an a x/r engement that the Bin Kathir and the Al Wo ? il section of the Aw amir should meet in Tarim and that an exchange oi stolen property snould take place. This v/as done at the suggestion of Al ’ ■/o ? i 1 , but unfortunately when the repre'sontai* tives of both tribes were present the Aw amir changed their minds about handing, over the stolen property and the Sultan, not heeding the advice given him oy nais narakat, \-L:.o had just left Tarim fox* Seiyun, failed to take a pledge from both parties and the shooting was the result, 302* ^ On --larch 22nd 0, a H, B&lt;L, received word in Tarim that a fight had scarted between two Av/amir .sections near Tariba. He at once left for the scene and. found the sections occupying their mot in the air and with envoys hwrryiiig^ - in an effort to keep the peace* Tho arrival of the soon disposed of the ? battio { and having collected a rifle from each side Barnkat • summoned the disputants before him* The trouble was as usual over a piece of land and he decided to bring various sectional heads into Seiyuii to discuss clatters with Sciyid Bubakr and the Sultan, as it was by'now near nightfall. On the following day ho returned to Tcriba, at the rc^^st of the Sultan, and carefully went aver the land in dispttt# forts, firing an occasa betv/eon the linos of battl7- and over which the Sultan had already given a decision. Barahat found'it possible to confirm the Sultan's decision but the aggressor, one of the Bin Kartin still refused to acknowledge it although the other sections of the tribe are in unanimous agreement with the Sultan over the mattorIt has been suggested that Bin Kartin should again be summoned to Seiyun, The effectiveness of a mobile force such as the II. B* L, has once more been demonstrated and there is no doubt that in most Hadhrami incidents a quick arrival on the scene will generally prevent the situation becoming serious, 303 o (190). The Tamim are still being a nuisance but are said to be some what subdued as they have heard of the prompt action taken by the Mukalla Government over the Muhoiniq affair, and believe that 200 not 100 soldiers have been sen- to srpport Bin ADjaj. There s no morw known resuls of the mooting about illegal t esc at ion ,ne iesua s lixgiuiess 1 gram then Qaim has given orders forbidding anyone to pay money to the tribes men 0 Rais Barahat has visited Inat during the week and reports that some of the Yafc'a soldiera are going a nuisance and tnat the slaves in the garrison arc more than that. The main complaint is insufficient ammunition, Thu Taim is anxious to build some forts around the town which is anwallcd, in order that the soldiers can stay on the outskirts rather than in the centre of 'Inat, This seems-a sound suggestion and he wishes to get an advance from Mukalla for building which he will repay when he collects ’ashur. The most successful result of Barakat 5 s visit was to be able to arrange to send a section of the Qu'aiti garrison to Mishta, which is an important outpost near the twon and covering the Bcdu approaches to the badi. The fort needs repair and was included in the sites visited by, the h*A* when he was in the area last January, Thv.ro is no change in the Husn Iiutahir situation which is still rnanied by A1 Tamim* The F*A.

If the linheiniq affair turns out as well as it appears to be at the moment Seiyicl Bubakr is anxious to pay a visit to Tarim to try to meet various Tamimi heads and talk things out with them. Be is anxious however to take with him some soldiers in order to gi;o evidence of Government (ie.Mukalla Government) interest in tno matter, 304, The P.A.'ihA^ paid a short visit to Shibom in order to investigate reports of fresh trouble between the Kaib and his Treasury Clerk., The main cause seemed to be that the Clerk regarded himself as the Shibam State Treasurer and was doing a number of things over the head of the Kaib. An attempt was made to reduce the Clerk to his proper level and it was made easier by the discovery of a cortai^ G nnmber of irregularities in accounting procedure which have boon/down to Mukalla for informa- strong .Lo n Dm bam, whicn shows tion. There is .. _ ^ far more interest in progress than either Soiyun or Tarim, that a local boy should fill this post hs thoy say that from Shibam have come some of the best Clerks in tne service of the Gcvei’n*** monts in Aden and in British Comaliland a 505c There was also an opportunity to have a number of general discussions with the Kalb, who m spite of certain woIX known faults is without doubt exceptionally honest and loyal to_ his Sultan.

If it proves possible to come to an agreement with Al Hakim Hubarok bin to control at Qa^dha then the matter would be comparatively simple. This howoVer will be far from easy to obtain. It is unlikely that in any circumstances he would agree to troops being permanently garrisoned in Qa’udha alt ough he might well offer to assist in other ways. Full control and inspection at Al Abr and Bir Asakr would be the most effective of a 11 but ae there would be constant armed rveis-tanc\i to any^atsh attempt by Government, necessitating a substantial increase of the garrisons at these places the results might not justify the raoetts used. 307. Bnough Barseom has now been sown at the Demonstration plot in Sviyun to supply fodder for the II.B.L. camels and the first crop will very shortly be ripe. Local wheat has suffered on account of the recent rain and the crop will not be so good as at first anticipated. There seems however no doubt that the Date crop will be better than last year though it will be unfortunate if there is more rain within the next month. 308. (180) F.A.R*A. ?

The Sheikhs protested_against the levying of market duos in Jol Ash Sheikh* and against the pros-o&amp;ce of Balhaf Tribal Guards in Jol Ash Shaikh* The R.A. informed them that it was necessary for a garrison to he posted there to control the collection of Customs duo. The strength of the guard wa s influenced by the amount of traffic passing though the post. He was of opinion that a force of 6 soldiers was insufficient but If would prdbablj 7 ' be -Adequate. The Sultan made vehement protests that they should not be forced to accept Balhaf Tribal Guards, who were under the Balhaf Suitan ? to whom they denied any allegiance, but affirmed that they were under the orders of the British Government* The R.A. then saw Sultan Abdulla 5 the Balhaf Regent. ^The Regent agreed that it would be satisfactorj? - if the Sheikhs bound themselves under bond to provide the necessary force for collection of Customs due. The actual collection would be under the super vision of a clerk. As regards tim Market Buec, the R.A. informed the Regent, that as the dues had been imposed only^in^April 1940, and the previous R.A. had apparently been dubious about its collection, he was prepared to allow a moratarium of one year, after which the position could be reviewed. The Regent made some protest but the R.A* assured him that there v/as no inoontion of departing front .ancient customs in this or any other area of his territories. The Abdul liana* Sheikhs were then recalled and given the option of accepting ten Balhaf Tribal Guards or signing a bond proper supervision of the collection of the Customs at Jol AS Shcildfe. They will consider this and reply in 24 hours.

It was therefore uecided that Government should regard Beit Ali’s attitude as inimical for which they deserve punishment and the strict confiscation of their Keilas and other available interests. It was further decided that the responsibility for carrying out these arrangements should be entrusted to the Military Section and that the ILA.R.A. and the Military Secretary should go to Shihr to organise patrol work, to decide the_building of Kharid fort and to take other steps as they Q.eem expedient, out the interests of the friendly and ally tribes should, be observed, 33Ch The Assistant State Secretary then suggested that the friendly and ally tribes should be su intoned for the purpose cf coniirming to them Government 3 friendship and alliance on the one hand and to warn them against helping the enemy on the other, Without prejudice to what further action the Military Secretary may think necessary to take to make the bar. very effective the following points should be made clear to all friends and allies (a) The camel h for all Beau camels must be within Shihr wall. (b) Friendljr tribes and allies to be allowed only their normal rations and no more that might enable them to supply the enemy, (c) Government would seise all enemy camels and livestocks that may be lllicited into Shihr, (d) Necessary steps to be taken to ensure that the friendly tribes and allies' camels are not serving the enemy any purpose. The Military Secretary will see that the ban is imposed as strictly as possible on Beit Ali and Resident Adviser impressed upon Qu'aiti State officials the necessity of full co-operation in this respect. 331. (287) Dicision was given that Beit All’s keila should be detained by Government until a time to be considered later for the disposal thereof. Instructions already given to detain their Keila. Qu’aiti and Kathiri forces in Hadhranaut will also be asked to extend all possible help in making the ban effective on Beit Ali.

Some time a^o Beit Ajil looted 75 goats from the Sibai trihe. Teh days ago the Sihai looted 25 goats from the Ajil tribe. Beit, though enemies of Government, complained to Qaim Dis. Beit Ajil having heard about Beit Ajil complaint lodged a complaint against Beit Ajil for looting 75 goats from them. They also expressed their fear that Beit. Ajil may attach them any time and ashed for Government’s help. The Baivi Dis commenting on this incident suggested that help may he extended to Beit Sibai who have and are friends and helpful to Government. The matter was discussed and it r as decided to write to the Beit Ajil enquiring if they would agree to Government's intervention for settlement between them and Sibai and simaltaneously that a letter to the Sibai 336. for peace, gave them recovered be sent to Qaim Bis to enquire as to what sort of help request Government to extend to them.

The Kathiri State ( as reported be A, R. A. Seiyun) 337. After repeated efforts on the part of the Siltan the Awamir Huqaddams arrived in Seiyun to discuss the building of a fort at Uneizat. Discussion followed devious routes and was thoroughly irritating but after six hours talh Seiyid Bubahr successfully, divided the tribesmen amongst themselves and having tahen the variou groups into darh corners returned to the council chamber and annou nced' to the Sultan that he thought he had settled the matter. In fact the muoaddams agreed to have the fort built and that it should be manned half by Government troops and half by localt ribesmen. A paper concerning this decision was after a further hours discussion signed and the reluctance of the various parties to put their signature to the document indicated the delicate structure of the foundations. After the usual ’coffee’ had been paid the nuq&amp;dc-anuP returned homo. It is necessary to g et the money and build at once otherwise there may be backsliding according to the general politi cal situation throughout the 'Tadi. The most significant fact which came out of the discussions was the Awanir objection to Government picking on them about the Kamum when Government was taking no steps to stow the main door which was Ghurfa. The Awamir are a good tribe and if the general situation can improve there will_be help from them. The troube is as alwa 2 ws that they fear reprisals from such Bedu as the Hamum should they commit themselves to Government and Government not be able to control the Hamum or Bin Abdat. 338. At a meeting of State Council further discussions wore held on the new taxation and the report of the conmittee set up to look into the matter and produce the estimates was put before the meeting. Houses with the required number of rooms were placed at 3,000 and date palms in the Seiyun town and suburbs (excluding those of the tribesmen) at 150,000. The Tarim date figures have not yet arrived and a reminder was sent to Seiyid Abdul Rahman, It is a pity that Seiyid Alawi A1 Kaf is in Aden as he has had many diScussion^ with the B.A.R.A. on the matter over the past year and it is in his Rahman is searching.

Prom there he was taken to Ghurfa keep him as they did not want e under customary obligation by Beit Ali who asked Ubeid Saleh to to be in trouble with Government but were . . to shelter and even fight in protection of any murderer. tlboid $ a leh refused. This is nothing to his credit as there is no ’ ayb among settled tribesmen greater than to shelter a murderer at a time when the r a .re in peaceful relations with Governmend and ho^ was far more afraid of 'Tibal than Government re—action should no4 57 have taken him in. ' Actually he advised the Bedu to keep because being Bedus, he told then. Government would not interx^W^ with them. This is very typical of ITbeid Saleh’s tactics in opposing Government. At the moment it appears that ITasr Awadli is frequently pljring between the Beit Ali camps and a_place on the djol, not far south of the v /adi by the name of 3a Jud. it is inliabited by A1 Siquer and Ali-Ash Shein nomadic sections of A1 Kathir. This news was received by Sei.yid Bubakr from a number of A1 Qitban who are working for him. 340. The problem is now to capture ITasr Awadh. While he is in a Beit Ali camp it would be impossible firstly because their car. jp sites vary and secondly because the present military resources not adequate to start trouble which would develop on a large scale with Beit Ali. Steps are being taken to find out if. his visits to A1 Kathir are regular and if so the whole H.3.L. force could be sent to fling a cordon round the village and attempt to capture him. Bighting would certainly take place as the utmost secrecy must be maintained, and if suddenly surrounded A1 Kathir would fight. It is however just possible that if there is sufficient force and if it is possible to surround the village by night and then immediately to inform A1 Kathir what Government is after they may hand him over. As ITasr Awadh is a notorious killer with seven murders already to his credit it is unlikely that he wi11 be taken alive. The completion of investigations will take a week or two. 341. The compilation of information about Ubeid Saleb’s - --behaviour is a great problem, Bverything said about him has to be checked carefully because the feeling against him locally is more angered than the feeling of Government who naturally wishes to play fair with him knowing how many personal scores his enemies wish to pay off which date back over a long period. It seems to be reliably reported that he has sent one of Ba Abbud of Ghurfa to the Hanium. Ubeid Saleh is never foolish enough to write letters to.the Hamum nowadays as he knows that Government will try to g et adequate proof before pinning anything on him. He generally makes use of Ba Abbud as envoys. Sheikh Hud Ba Abbud was the man sent and it is reported that he met, on the djol Amr bin Awadh with five men and a flock of sheep on their way to market in the Hadhramaut. The message was passed between them and Amr bin Awadh told Hud to go and meet Ahmed bin Kabreish, The relations between Ahmed bin Habreish and Arm* bin Awadh are interesting. Outwardly they are quarelling on the subject of Ubeid Saleh because some time ago Ahmed neatly double crossed Ubeid Saleh over some amiuntion. Ahmed is supposed to hate Ubeid Saleh and also Amr because Amr is ct present very close to Ubeid being clever and playing his cards carefully till he sees what Government is going to do to Ubeid Saleh. In actual fact it seems likely that in spite of disagreement about Ghurfa affairs and friendships Ahmed and Amr pretend for some subtle reason of internal politics and the necessity of keeping the section divided until the Huqaddam is elected that they are at variance but actually they work in eo-operation. The reason for tlx? message being sent by Hud is probably that Ubeid Saleh is annoyed at the success of the treaty with Ba Hasan and is sending for a number of Hamum to come to Ghurfa. It seems beyond anjr doubt that Ubeid Saleh in spite of, perhaps because of warnings, is working to wreck the Hamumi negotiations and he has so far certainly succeeded in the case of Seiyid Bubakr*s efforts which has greatly disheartened him. 342. It is reported from Shibam that the Board of Survey there found certain irregularities in the Treasury. The matter is connected .&lt; with revenue receipts and requires full investigation. The F.A.R.A. found certain other irregularities of a purely technical kind during a visit a week a go and these have been reported. It appears necessary / for a complete and thorough investigation to be made at the earliest possible moment, 343, (298) Disquieting rumours are circulating about the Muheiniq affair but it is fatal to become alarmed over rumours in ♦ the Hadhramaut. It is known that A1 Hakim bin Thabit sent a letter to the Kukalla Goverment written in similar style to t hat favoured '^j by Ubeid Saleh. It now seems that Ubeid Saleh prompted the writing r 1 of the letter.' It is also reported by ITaib Shibam that Ubeid Saleh has sent, ammunition to Bin Thabit and that he is about to send him a nu :ber of Hamum. It is very unlikely that the story of the Hanum is true because it would bring out the help of Ubeid Saleh too openlyand start a crcs.t deal of trouble between t hem and Bin A,j jaj wliicli it does not seen would be of advantage to Uboid Saleh. It is possible that Ali bin Salah is trying to pet the Hamun to cone fron Ghurfa because the troubleeene citizens of the Western Hadhranaut were both surprised and worrie at the prompt arrival of the troops. It is said that Ubeid Saleh is particularly concerned and thinlis Government is preparing for a campaign against him. It is hoped that this nay press upon his mind and encourage him to sign the Bond and -pay the fine. Apart fron the rumours the facts appear at present to be that the Uuheinia situation is well in hand, A1 11 ahin Mubarah is most friendly and pleased at the help given to him, that the building of the forts is to begin and that generally if the trouble makers can be kept out of too much intrigue there is hope of making arrangements with the help of Bin Ajjaj which will con rol the general situation in the area. 344. A scheme for thedevelopnent of a demonstration market garden is under discussion between the F.A.R.A. and Seiyid Abdul Rahanian A1 Kaf, Seiyid Abdul Rahman seems prepared on generous terms to give the large garden of his simmer house in Seiyun for t..i purpose and that it might be possible to run this in addition to the Seiyun Demonstration Plot which is of a rather different nature. , The F.A.R.A. is shortly proceeding to Tarim where hewillg o into’ details with Seiyid Abdul Rahman and transmit a proposal to the R.A. 345. A Thai’ ani has arrived at the office, very disgusted that he has not received full payment for seve al cases of'R.A.F. petrel which he brought to Inat some months ago. He was paid trnsp©-riW 13 1s. He comes from Reidat Abdul. Wadud and was offered by the F.A. R.A, aV'to be given suitable , f Q_ahwa (b) to be given a note to his Qaim c;. to be given agnote to R.A. in Hukalla. He refused the *gahwa’ and the notes and was somewhat abusive/ He Was warned to behave „ himself 'and a note was written to Qain Inat where he would return telling him to keep an eye open. It is surprising that there have not been more of his kind arriving here as the collection of tHe'small .qu ailtTty. which was possible here was rather a hard task. •, ■ , .. 346. Seiyid Bubakr Al Kaf has left for Tarim- in an attempt to settle the Tamim troubles which do not improve. It is pretty evident Jfint.yUbeid Saleh- i-^g noW;^ilV triosc‘ ceTTt.act wfth Ali bin Falluga and Al Abd bin Ycnani and his pressure on thou ;n will be increased rather .than.-.decreased by the‘arrival of forces In the Halid area. -He is alsnost certain to try to have part of them transferred to the eastern part of. the Wadi- and' this aspect of the'general situation needs wat chit If Seiyid'Bubakr cannot achieve success # particularly with Al Tamim, the, situation-is bad. v • . ' • . - &gt; 347. SaLim bin Hus.€i.n Al.Afif .a Yafe f i tribesman from Al Uada near'Al'Qath lias arrived in Seiyun saying that his house has been occupied by a. number of slaves of Ali. bin Sal ah who on being asked by'' Salim why they had. come announced that they were Government soldiers. Salim was unable or did not wish t 0 give 'rGason for the action and a letter was sent to Ali bin Salah suggesting that the story might not bo t rue and asking for his comments. It was also pointed out that should the slaves have taken the action reported they must be withdrawn as there were only throe Governments operating'in the Kadhramaut. Salim bin Hussein was told to return to the friends with whom he was staying since his enforced evacuation and warned that he must provoke no warlike action pending the reply from Ali. bin Salah. A prompt but unsatisfactory reply was received mgrom^li giving no details of the affair but vaguely mentioning that it was a decision of the Yafe T i Board and that it could not be expected to report on decisions of the Board. This apart from being a rather rude reply is nonsense. At present the Board is defunct as its members'have guarelled among themselves generally and particularly with Ali bin Salah. A further letter has been sent to Ali bin aaXah saying that it cannot be agreed that Yafe 1 ! Board decision are to be kept secret and asking for a report on the matter. A helpful rcplj is not to be expected. It is thought that the affair may have some connection with a two year old ouarrel between Salim Affif and his cousin Abdulla, a professional wrestler who used to exhibit his prowes on Salim who is not in the same class. For doing this Abdulla was some time ago fined by the Haib of Shibam and later Salim shot and wounded Abdulla for which he was taken to Hukalla for trial. The Haib is conducting an investigation but is not easy for him to interfere with the affairs of Ali bin Salah who make no pretence of7 D Seiyun and Tarim arc too well off s as they are to wish to Toe w freed” hut that slaves of Shanafir tribesmen may wish to take advantage of the facilties offered, 357^ (267) The O.Cf ILB.L,-, reports that he met the Ilahra Uuqaddans at Tarim on 1st April, They expected to meet the Aw amir Ituqaddams to discuss the recovery of their property which had been Tooted ’'oy Aw ami r 3 but the date of meeting was postponed to allow wo rlv in the fields recently irrigated by the rains, and the news had not reached thorp ’Thilo they were in Tarim, one of the camels looted from them came into the town, was seized and returned to thw 'together with two of their camels which had been recaputred from hpeit Qatban in Shihr last year, which pleased them very much. The; were also given a small money present. ' They signed n. document extending their truce with the Awamir for 2 months from the middle of Hay; they also signed a 6 month’s Truce with Beit Qatban starting from 1st April, 358. The 0.G o H.B»L, believes that the Mahra wish the roads from their country to the Hadhramaut to be kept safe but that the Hadhramaut tribes are not be trusted unless a force is available to keep them in order. He expects that the Awamir will.try to avoid meeting the Mahra Huqaddams and that confiscation of their camels will be necessary to force them to restore the Mahra’s property. Yemen. 359. The P,A. R.A, reports that according to information received from A1 Abr, the King of the Yemen has sent a special envoy to the Sei’ar to make a series of pacts with them. The Sei’ar according to the report appear to have refused the offer and confirmed that they are :f sons of Government ”. When the report was received its significance was carefully discussed with Seiyid Bubakr and it was felt that the matter was of little concern as it referred to the annual treaties made between sections of the Sei'ar and sections of the Ycmani tribes just over the border. This appears to be the season of peace pacts in that area. Further letters were however sent to the Jemadar at A1 Abr to send -1 once more information but it is'''possible that he was unaware o:. me annual pacts as the garrison has lately been relieved, . The Hahidi Sultanates of Bir Ali and Balhaf . 350,. (3.09) On 30th April the B,A. saw the Abdul Liana’ Sheikh in the'presence of Sultan Abdulla.

They were referred to another agreement which confirmed. &lt; the status of Sheikh; Muhammad.

They now find that the obstacle of the waterless desert is beyond their powers and they are stranded without funds. They are being returned to the Coast and inquiry is being made whether they were permitted to land'at any controlled port without the prescribed papers and money, or whether they came in through uncontrolled country. Another pilgrim has reached Mukalla, a Hausa who has come overland from San’a, and says he is on his way to Baghdad, 368, Further rain has been falling all over the interior of the Hadhramaut, more heavily in the western areas.

The sain point however is tnat uhe peace has temporarily been kept and as a sign of good faith by Abdalla he agreed through Seiyid Bubakr to make an advance ox a hundred o.oiiars co salim. The furure of this case will _ have tobe carefully watche cl as it nay have serious repercussions and it is noped to be able to put off any crisis until the arrival of the Resident Adviser in the Hadhranaut when the natter can be discussed with Ali bin Sulah who is without doubt the cause of all the trouble. 3S1« F.AoR.A, accompan during the Y7oek a -he with the new taxation tion with Raish Barakat anc journey of return was made. .act :&gt;y Pais Shibarn went to Tarim lain business of 1?,A* R.

A large party of fifteen cars containing' the returning Seiyun guests at the recent A1 Kaf wedding decide^ not to be delved by the rain and so numerous stout dhafa from Tarim were employed to drag aack car over the r iver bed as the water was not deep. The process took about three hours but was accomplished without mishap. 332. (346) No success has been achieved in the Ternini talks. There is no dbour that A~ Abd bin Yemani is having pressure put upon him to resist from outside intriguers almost certainly b y Ubeid Saleh. A1 Abd is insistent that the Shaim and Harf collected oeforo the peace should be again collected and in the case of Shaim this has already been taken in a few cases. It was felt that peace efforts at present were of little use and that the; 7 would be wrongly interpreted as weakness and so little more was done than to draw up a plan of offensive action by Government which would enable strategic points to be soused or handed over under pressure which when manned would mei oirc-rol L 1 .um 6 , The plan which at first appeared an ambitious one on investigation appeared possible if 100 soldiers for the actual purpose of seizing the strategic points and the spear head of waon would be the H*B 9 L« were made available. Once the points had been seized a much smaller force could occupy them. i ;, .A.R.a o was strongly opposed to the suggestion that some troops from Eahd country should be sent to strengthen the garrison at Inat and stressed the necessity of completing one thing properly rather than trying to get the Mukalla Government to do two things at once. The apparent sense of this was agreed to although Rais Barakat took a serious view of the situation which he felt was urgent in order to keep up the name of Government. This may be so but plans must be made according to available resources and being comparatively new to the politics of the V/adi he does not yet realise, nor is there any reason why he- should because it is strange'and difficult for any foreigner Arab or English to understand, that e.g. the successful conclusion of the Muheiniq. affair might of its own accord quell the Tamim troubles which are more easy to localise then those in Nahd country and no less urgent. There is however no deubt that the situation of A1 Tamim is very serious even if it is liable t‘o exaggeration at the hands of the Bely ids of Tarim. It was decided ch&amp;t the plan na de should not be submitted to ment in the matter was cl a: local efforts at diplmatic i/:umaxxa uxiuxx one policy of that Govern- ‘ifiee. It was decided to moke no more approach to Bin Yemani as he only translated them as weakness and because masterly inactivity as a weapon is at times cf considerable use. Bluff is dangerotrsr au» iis— may be called, a genuine attempt to find out the true facts is usually mistranslated but if nothing is said in a situation such as this a rumour is apt to be spread that Government is going to pounce r/ithout warning, and the trouble makers often sit back to await furthe developments,-_ 4 ~ 383, A most unfortunate incident has occurred at A1 Mishta near Inat. This village is inhabited by Seiyids and poor men who are for obvious reasons very loi^al to Government. They have no armed power at all. Bin Yemani called a meeting of A1 Taming at Mishta and its purpose appeared to be anti-government, Seiyid Bubahr at once advised the Qaim Inat to send a fev? soldiers frora Inat to go there and see that no Incident took piace 3 The Qaim agreed but the Arif in charge of the garrison who is a talkative fellow and has caused the Qaim a lot of trouble refused to send his men or perhaps fairer to say could not persuade them to go. The plea was the old one of insufficient ammunition. This is nonsense. To conduct an operation there is a shortage which was brought some weeks ago to the notice of Mukalla and wmch is being dealt with. But each man has 50 rounds and there was no likeli hood of fighting taking place. Seiyid Bubakr’s advice was simply in order to show the flag and if possible thereby curb the tongues of the meetingo As a result of the refusal of the soldiers to go, A1 Tamim behave like hooligans and looted a shop. Most unfortunate -ly the main body of the H.B.L, was temporarily at Leijun and the looters are safely back in their dars. Those who were said to have refused to go were partly slaves and partly Yafe’is. They were summoned before the Naib in Tarim and told their fault pretty plainly by him supported by Seiyid Bubakr and P.A R.A Rais Barakat who had gone to Inat to investigate as soon as the incident was reported had brought back a report that the discipline of the garrison was bad. This was certaily confirmed by the meeting although whatever his other faults may be the Naib certainly has a powerful influence over the Yafe’is and slaves who respect him and are afraid of his anger, IkA.R.A. told the men what they might expect on the arrival of the M,A.R,A, but their attitude was sulky and it is not easy to deal with incidents with soldiers of the character of slaves or Yafe’is, Among the latter at least there is some stupid kind of tradition that unless they are bristling with ammunition they^cannot leave their bases as it is a kind of ayb 1 . The slaves are just plain afraid and useless except when sitting in a fort. The unfortunate fact that the Qaim is a slave may also have had to do with the matter as although he is a good enough trier and honest he has little influence and without a good deal of indirect help from Seiyid Bubakr would be useless. When a complete inquiry is made by the Ik A,R,A, on arrival it may be found that the whole blame really rests on the Arif- Action for this looting incident must^ be taken but it is a prt of the general Tamim trouble. The meeting itself appears to have done little more than to re—afiirm the rights for collecting dues. 384, F.n.R.A, discussed with the Tarim Council of Seiyids the proposed new taxation. It was received coldly but rather more easily than in Seiyun and general approval was expressed at the new taxation on imports at the coast. On the suoject oi o.ace palms ic was pointed out that if Government wished to levy a tax it must guarantee (a) that the constant menace ox Tarim palms being seized Vjy Tamim was removed and (b) that the method of collection was more strictly controlled than in the past as the slaves coinmit various minor atrocities in collecting ’Ushur’. Tno Tarim^slaves, uncontrolled by Sultan Muhammad bin Muhsin* who lives in Seiytin most of the time are more troublesome even than the Seiyun slaves. Then the inevitable difficulty arose. The meeting said that it could come to no decision without the written instructions of bultan Muhammad bin Muhsin, 385. The situation of the Sultanate of Tarim is perhaps the most important problem of internal administration in the State. By written agreement the kingdom was divided in 1918, The British Government does not recognise this agreement and regaras Sultan Muh d as Governor only of Tarim. It is generally recognised in the Stat-e that the Sultan of Seiywu- is the Kathiri Sultan although ohe lac-c of recognition by the Government of Sultan Muhammad is no fully understood,. Sultan Muhammad by himself can be managed. He is a -jealous and hot tempered person but has little wish it seems lor power of any kind, ' The prohlen of the slaves in Tarim is mu oh more difficult. Any open suggestion that Sul van Munam.iao. was not Sultan in his own right in Tarim and a word from Sultan Muhammad to the slaves would cause a considerable amount of trouble which could not; n: has been built up* - b - be coped with at least until a strong K.C.C. There is no power in Tarir.i_but the slaves. Up to the present anc. owing uo che difficulties of getting Seijnm on its feet Tarim ne G‘lccted although the administrative position and records ox Tariii are wacched by the F.A.R. 3 A. as best as they can be, Un— fortunacely di ring 'che past month trouble has occurred between the Town Council of Seiyids and the Sultan. B3 7 ' agreement this body usee, to handle with fair efficiency the internal administration of Tarim dug now rather than attempt to rea.ch a settlement with the Sultan they have simply given up the reins to him which means in effect to the slaves for Sultan Muhammad seldom goes to Tarim, a 3; so ^ported that the slaves are discontented with him'and that a few of them have complained to Sultan Jafar, The situation has possibili g ies provided tha.t the Kathiri Sultan can e^cert his influence over the Tarim slaves, Sultan Muhammad can have the situauion explained to him without interference by the palace and clerical intriguers and the Seiyids of Tarim can be brought of their' sulky mood. If these three far from easy things can be^achievcd it will be possible to gain as much control of the Tarim administra- in Seiyun and new form that provided the control shocu tion as of that built up in its 386 0 (295; A visit was paid to Ubeid ord.er go convey a letter to him about paying discussing the technical points in the wording of the Bond later, F.A,R,A, decided not go go personally to Churfa as a form of protest agains g his treatment by Ubeid Saleh during his previous visit.

The suggestion has been transmitted to the Resident Adviser but Ubeid Saleh nas not put anytning m writing yet to confirm this suggesGion and it is bnouglit that he is merely testing the barometer about the holding his money. It is not insignificant that there appear^ to be a number of people who previously had been advancing money go Ubeid and OGhers who had been acting as his agents who are now refusing to deal with him and this without Government pressure being put on them, Muheirez told Ubeid Saleh that he must submit his proposal in writing to the Resident Adviser, Fo letter has yet been received and one is not to be* 388, Some indication of the difficulties of intrigue even in small matters are shown by trouble over the recruitment of a single tribesman from Minebari in the K.A„C, Having been taken on his relations (his parents are dead) have written to the Sultan asking that he should be released at once.. The reasons given are that he is a 1 harami : , On investigation it was found that the youth had quarelled with his relations and did not now dare to live with them ^he Sultan was anxious to have the man released for fear of getting into trouble with the tribesmen who are strong and previously were in league with Ubeid Saleh, It was pointed out to him by the F.A.R.A. that he must be c areful of his reputation v/ith tribes if he always gave in to them in matters such as this. On going to Tarim F.A.R.A, found that Seiyid Bubakr had also received a letter from the tribes— men asking for the soldier's release and that for political reasons he was anxious to have him released. It was poihted out to Seiyid Bubakr that when the youth himself was most anxious to join up and had the appearance_of being a fair recruit, it would be difficult to discharge him without damaging both the reputation of the Solytni' Government and the K«A»C, He pressed for his release on the grounds that it was politically important at the moment to keep on good terms v/ith Minebari. A decision pends the return ofSeiyid BulDakr to Seiyim so that he^natter oat with the Saltan hat alt ho a oil it woald ho ahsard to nake a political moantain oat of a military molehill eve;ry effort mast he made to avoid bringing too much ’siasa T into military matters. The present political difficalties in the Hadhramaat althoagh always exaggera ted are troahlesome and antil the Bin Ahdat affair is settled there mast he a certain amoant of compromise hat too much of this when coupled with the many unpleasant and lying tongues which there will always he here only makes the situation worse, 389. Naih Shiham has seized 250 rounds of Mauser and 50 rounds of 303 ammunition brought into Shiham by two Hamami carriers. The men are ’teeing kept in Shiham pending inquiry into the destination of the ammunition which is said to he Qaudha hut it has not yet been satisfactorily explained why ammunition coming from the Yemen to Al Ajjaj should pass through Shiham, Prom jftll local advice it appears that the traffic of small quantities of ammuntion such as this could he stopped by a notice issued by the Resident Adviser or the Aden Government hut dealing with such as Uheid Saleh is a more difficult matter and will certainly require the co-operation of Al Hakim Mubarak bin Ajjaj* It will he interesting to hear the t rue story of the place from which the 303 ammuntion came. The Wahdidi Sultanates of Bir Ali and Balhaf, 390, (360) On 5th JJay the Abdul Man a* Sheikhs again called at the Residency office and this time wished to sign the agreement under which they will he responsible for the supervision of the collection of Customs at Jol Ash Sheikh.

Miss Viney, Child Welfare Worker, left on 15th May on relinquishing her appointment. She has been in Mukalla since May 1939. 398. Hadhrami merchants who have recently arrived at the Coastal ports from Mogadiscio highly praise the tranquillity established by the British Forces in Somaliland. They paid a tribute to the facilities and a ssistance extended to the' Arab merchants particularly the Hadhrami by the British authorities in Mogadiscio. The swift sweep of the British Forces over the Italian Somaliland ports is said by the Kadhrami to have prevented the retreating Italian Forces from plundering the shops in the way they did in several areas in interior of the Italian Somaliland. The Qu^aiti State. 399. Prince, Sultan Awadh, has re-married the daughter of Sheikh Muhammad Abdulla Afif a Thulud Yafa , i of Shihr. This is his ninth adventure in matrimony. 400* The teacher of the Mukalla Girls School daughter of Sheikh Abdulla bin Ahmed Nakhibi, headmaster of the Arabic School Mukalla has married a teacher of the Mukalla Arabic School. There are 90 pupils in the Girls School and it is doubtful whether another teacher can be found to replace her. 401. The Educational Assistant to Resident Adviser, in his first report upon the Coastal Schools of the qu'aiti State reports that owing to undue conservatism and religious prejudice he has been unable'to introduce the full scale of improvement which he had wished, and has had to concentrate on (a) Preparation of courses for all schools (b) General improvemnts in Arabic and Arithmetic in lower classes (d) improvements in the organisation of the Education Department and in the management of schools (e) Improvement of teachers training. In addition the first Girls School has been opened. Work is now being done on the improvement of post primary education. 402. (113) The F.A.R.A* reports that the culprits were 20 men of Beit Ali and Beit Shineni. No other info nation is yet available, 403. (243) Sultan Jafar has reported to the Resident Adviser that the Assumah who arc accused of murdering of Al Amiri are available with Abed Alwi Attamimi but he asked the Sultan not to interfere with them as they arc his tribesmen and sons. The Sultan has answered him that he should detain thorn awaiting the R.A. f s orders.01 404, the Lower Ahmed Court, - 2 - Salim 3a 1 aehan has been appointed to he Jud Hukalla, under the Courts Decree. 405. On loth I!ay a shoot was carried out by M.R.A. Artillery The guns in action were 1 12 pdr. and 2 10 pdrs. Three Targets were used (a) a small tower at 1950 x (b) Representing a Machine Gun area 2010 (c) Representing troops in the open on a forward slope 2500 . v The Military Assistant to Resident Adviser who was present was of the opinion that the shooting was not at all bad considering the small amount of training carried out and the fact that all^the Artillery personnel for the past few months had either been on detachment in Aden or in defensive position on the hill overlooking the Town, . 10 rounds shrapnel per gun were fired and one rouno. of H.3. by the 12 pdr. H*S. has to be economised as there is none for the 2 10 pdrs. and only 50 rounds for 12 pdr. The Target areas (b) and (c) were hit but the tower target (a) was not. Error was mostly liffceral. The estimation of ranges being pretty accurate. Subeidar Wadi Khan, commanding M.R.A. Artillery obtained ranges by triangulation as he has no range finder This latter is essential, for an operation in a rough and broken country such as this, it will seldom be possible to pace out the base line which is neejssary for obtaining ranges by this method. The rate of fire was slow as only the 12 pdr, has any recoil appa ratus and the resultant time spent on relaying is excessive. It should however be improved by training. 405. (Hi) Mr. A.C.Paul, Tobacco Specialist, left on 15th May for Aden where he will enter into negotiations for a contract for the manufacture in Aden of cigarettes containing locals grown tobacco. 407. ' The P.A.R.A. reports a fight between Bena Andh Yaf’i and A1 Badr bin Muhammad at A1 Part near Qatn in which it is believed that one each side was killed, 408, The Naib Shibam has telegraphed that there has been an exchange of shots amongst Lahmadi. Sons of Abdulla bin Nasir Lalimadi provoked a fight against Salim Abdulla bin Said Lahmadi who has been shot dead. 409. On 10th Kay Sheikh Abdulla bin Hasan Ba Abbad of Seihut previously Mansab of 'G-hurfa came to R,A. and Sultan Saleh with documents alleging his ancestors to have been the owners of a large portion of the Kathiri and qu’aiti States. He told the R.A. that the present rulers in the Hadhramaut were in the past political agents of his ancestors who were the real kings. It seems he is suffering from delusions and had presented similar demands to Mr. Figgis. He went back to his country. • 410. (375) No success has been achieved in the Awabitha talks. Instructions were therefore given to the Naib and gain, to arrest persons or animals of the Awabitha'entering their areas. The Awabitha took the initiative and damaged the water stream at Gheil and interfered with the subjects. Government decided to write to the A abith asking them to come to Hukalla to reinstitute their actions or else their privileges and customs and properties will be confiscated. Their Keila and rights will be forfeited in the event of fresh approaches for reconciliation, 411. The gaim Gheil reports that the soldiers who were in persuit of the Bedus (Awabitha) met them at a place called Tahamein trhere they exchanged shots. The Bedus ran away and left behind them 2 donkeys which they had looted. The Qaim has asked for more soldiers# 412. The State Secretary saw■Mana 1 a bin Abdulla Banas of Awabitha tribe and confirmed to Government his.loyalty and assistance to Government, He discussed with him the question of his Keila and the State Secretary authorised the payment. 413. S&amp;id bin Salim, Abdulla bin Umar and Umar bin Ali JIuqaddans of A1 Haio who have been accused of participation in W** raids carried on by the Awabitha (Ba Zor) have written a bond to the Government whereby they bind themselves to fulfil any provedX - 3 ~ Having given this guarantee their hostage last Africa charge against then, was released, 414, Four of the Awabitha arrived at Shihr fron were arrested, 415. Two of the fazor Awabitha settlers at Shiheir cane to Ilii hall a and. confirned. their loyalty to Governnent. .41G, (334) Fron preliminary investigations by cross examination of the witnesses produced, it seems that there are grouncis to reope^ tlie case against Said bin Salim A1 Khanbashi for the murder of Shellih Ubud -Al Anoodi. it appears that when tne ^aahi proceeaed co Duan to investigate the case no witness was produced by the relatives of the victim. Investigation is still proceeding, ^ .f 16 * The State Secretary saw the Khanabisha guarantors for uhe alleged murderer of Sheikh Abud Al Amudi who protested against their long stay here. The State Secetary told them that Government suumonod onl u tne accused and asked them v/hother tn hand lum over or remove their guarantee. They replied that they still guarantee him and will hand him over if anything is moved against him. The Zei left Mukalia dissatisfied because thev ^submLS 1 ;i writin £ that all murder cases should '^tted to, Shari a. ihey were informed that murders in unsettled areas would be tried according to tribal customs.

The ban against the Beit Ali is still being enforced as they have refused to sign a truce with Government, The ban is far from fully efficacious, as sections of the Kamuni which are not under ban still enter Shihr and take sup lies which they trade to the Beit Ali at'Dufweiga and other places. A raid by the liilitary Secretary recently caught 6 men at this traffic, and they are now in prison. It is ho- ed that the presence of Mr. Fletcher in Shihr willh ave so :e restraining influence, 47S 0 Meanwhile overtures have been received from Mugaddams of the Beit Ali asking for a four or six months truce. The reason for this is obvious • it would enable them to enjoy the harvest, draw their annual payment, and then get the benefit of the fish season, for a mere four months cessation from looting, and would be a good bargain for then On the otter hand though Governemtn would far rather see a truce for a year, yet if the position deteriorates in the north it nay be necessar 3 r to conclude a short truce with the Beit Ali so as to avoid while the Government military resources are so a 5 'war on exiguous. two fronts' 477, (§543)A further attempt to settle the Hukheiniq. question has failed owing to Bin Thabit’s unwillingness to cooperate.

Bin Thabit however refused Aieir offers of mediation.

Rais Barahat Trad, 0/G, II.B.L. , and Saleh bin Sueida, Subedar' Road Guards, left geiyun for Leijun on the 3th June to encuire into the natter.

In the engagement which followed a few Yafa’is from gatn gave support to the soldiers and after some time the Huqad&amp;a'is of the Sharash.ir intervened and succeeded in stopping the fight, ^he i:uq.addams were taken to Shibam where the Haib imprisoned them for several days: they have since been released after paying a fine of $30 and agreeing to collect the crop under dispute and send it to the gaib. 484*. Ac coring to information received fro:: Shihr by Bubakr, there are indications that the Beit Ali section of Hamumis might make offers of a short truce with Government, the underlying intention being to secure the collection of the Kharif at Gheil bin Yomein. Seiyid. Bub a In? is of opinion that considera tion should not be given to any offers of peace for a period of ' less than one year. It has since been learnt that A.ir bin Awadh, the unrecognised head of the Beit Ali, loft Ghurfa to attempt collection of the date crop belonging to that section at Ghoil fria. Yomein i ho is said to have been supplied with ammunition by Bin Abdat. A special messenger was immediately despatched to Leijun convoking this information to Rais Barakat, O.C. II.B.L. 485. It is reported from Shibam‘that the Havramis’ visit to gain caused much discontent among the Yafa’is in Ali bin Salali’s pay: they voiced fhi r disapproval of Ali bin Salah’s new friendship in no uncertain -.manner and informed him that if the Hanumis remained they would leave the town.

He is now in prison awaiting trial, and Sultan Jaafar is enquiring into his alleged co plaints. 492. It is reported that Hanuiis who were in Ghurfa when the H.3.L. patrol passed by to effect the arrest lentionsd above, immediately seized their rifles and attempted to attack the patrol. Bin Abdat’s son and several slaves interfered and prevented the Hauumis leaving the town until the patrol had passed. According to information received by Rais Barakat from a beduin then within Ghurfa, the Hamumis took steps to intercept the patrol on its return but pulazim Khalid who was in command returned by another route and thus avoided the clash. 493. Several unpleasant incidents have occu. red between slaves ana the H.B.L. in Seiyun and on one occasion the slaves demonstrated near the Pastern Gate on the way to Husn Hawarith where the H.B.L. a~e stationed: the Sultan and Seiyid Bubakr bin SheikJi Al Kaf drove to the ispot and restored order. It has been cstablshed that the slaves have been mostly responsible for provoking these incidents but there are otto rs at work, and although vague hints of circulate the real ins tig, tors are probably nearer at hand. The situation al l» .ougr a.pyar ontly quiet, remains tense and the least incident may provoke another outburst. It is evident that the continued presence of the H.B.L. in Seiyun nor the slaves nor oven the Seiyids: prefer to see the II.B.L. :oved/ The force which might eventually sup lant Legion’s intrusion in whet they cons id. the Seiyids 1 alleged objection to the is because their families spend the su pleases neither the Sultan Seiyid Bubakr would sense j. i-, in the II.B.L. a even slave then and they resent the er their sphere; of influence; ::y\L. staying at Husn Hawarith . or there, while the Sultanwishes to avoid trouble at all costs and does not at bottom desire any change in the slave situation, although he has only nominal control over them. 494. The Sultan of Tarim has been' approached as to whether the H.B.L. could be stationed at Ghuraf: he stated he would not mind their- staying the night there on their way but considers it preferable that they should not remain at Ghuraf for any length of t inie. 495. Date Tax. The advisability of proceeding with the assessment of date palms in Seiyun was disc :ssed with Seiyid Bubalir, the State Secretary and the Assistant State Treasurer who all agreed that there is unlikely to be any insuperable difficulty. The main stumbling bicob at the present juncture remains one of finance to meet the wanes of the assess been sought on this issue from hub payment from advance account.

The message from the Resident Adviser* advising Bin Yemani not to take actam. likely to prejudice the hearingVf his case pending the R.A’s arrival in Hadhraiaut to settle the Tanini Date Racket has been communicated to Bin Yemani who has made no reply. There is however evidence tint the hug add am who had held his hand on first hearing' of the R.A’s visit has renewed attempts to extend the levy of ’Shaim’. The present position will become even more delicate when the corn harvest is to be gathered and is likely to come to a head, within a month, with the ’Kharif*. This has now in fact occurred and the Resident Adviser is at Tarim engaged upon negotiations.. '498. The Hamumis continue their raids in the Wadi On Mav 31st, a party of hammamis from W.

After some argument the Jfa .namis were requested to leave the town not however before the sale of their corn nad been negotiated. The motive for this murd&amp;r is ascribed ch theit oi a fine Mauser rifle belonging to the victim whereas it is pointed out that the purchase of thejr corn at Ghurfa was evidently to prevent their coming to Seiyun. The Hanmanis have lodged a complaint with the raib of Shibam formally accusing the the Hamumis of the murder.- 6 - v Pnr?

The J.A.Rm'n reports thaw the g .neral opinion in the Wadi Hajr is that Alawi bin Salih bin An .od, son of the last Sultan but one, will be elected Sultan of Bir Ali in succession to Rasir bin Talib who died in April 1940, T}ie J.A.R.A. met Alawi bin Salih in Keif a on 23rd May and pressed him to come'to Mukalla to see the Resident Adviser* He was unable to come, however, becatse he was not empowered to do so by the Kuqaddams of Bir Ali. At present any overtures from the Government are regarded by the people of Bir Ali with suspicion because of past attempts to make Sultan Nasir accept an Adviser Treaty and because of the ban reported to be imposed in Aden on exports to Bir Ali. Thissuspieion is one of the main causes of the delay in electing a Sultan; M the people of Bir Ali believe that if they have no elected hSd, they can avoid accepting a Resident Adviser treaty, 507. The fle-rk at Balhaf reports an outbreak of lawlessness among the Al Ba Qudha tribe. About Oth June 150 men raided Keif a but finding substantial armed opposition there they returned discomfited.

It has been ma e clear to Suleili that the most important part of his negotiation is to^ arrest the murderers of Seiyid Al Beiti and that on tnis point tlr R.A. the Governor of Ad©n p^ace much importance as the Qu aiti Government officials do themselves* It ’nas also been remembered that thet ribal aspect of the dispute appears to be easy of settle ment and hope was expressed that Suleili v/ould be able zo secure the arrest of the murderer by negotiation out ix the employment of force is absolutely necessary Government should uphold him in his actions. 539, Meanwhile complaints ha’ve been received that At if Husein Al Kaldij a Yafa muqa&amp;dan, who was sent to Hajr to assist Suleili. has been encroaching upon tribe’s rights.

It has now been decided that the slave while retaining his rights must either pay cash for the well and young palms or hand over a portion of the land to Bin Quteimi in accordance with their value* 628* The K* L C* are training well and hard but recruits are scarce and a complete blank among the Tarim mesakin was drawn as they are said to be receiving considerably more than ten dollars per month for building and agricultural work*. 629* Hie Information Officer in Aden has sent a package of propaganda newspapers and magazines personally addressed to Ubeid oaleh who handed them back to the postal runner v/ith the comment that he wished to have nothing to do with such staff* The copies are being distributed in Seiyun* 630* (§§ 54.8, 5c 0 etc) On the fourth September ten slaves of the Lanqa house who a* 0 - e sponsibae for fie’ murders m Tarim left Tarim' and were reported to be heading for Gheil bin Yomein.

The Sultan Muhammad Governor 01 Tc.riii was immediacely inxormed that the Governor v/ould take a no|t grave view of his conduct if the slaves were admitted to Tarim during his aosence in Seiyun.

The Assistant Resident Adviser again pressed Sultan Muhammad to take all possible steps to secure the slaves from the Aw&amp;kTir, but he replied that these were a tribe not under his authority who already harboured several murderers whom they were unwilling to release, and ne had no hopes that they would surrender the Lanqa slaves. The Assistant Resident Adviser stressed that he must not allow them to re-enter Tarim, and it was time that he returned to his town, which v/as obviously in need of firm governmenti The Sultan said he had written to his ..gent there, and unless lie received a favourable reply within two days he would return. It is know that the collection of his date rents, which is the reason for Sultan Muhammad s presence in Seiyun is almost completed, and there willshortly be less difficulty in persuading &amp;in to return to Tarim, 637# Soiyid Bubakr has been of the greatest assistance in tracing the fugitives and in keeping Government informed. He has nis agents and spies in many places which the normam Government channels do not touch, and his resources have been unhesitatingly put at the disposal of H.M.G. who are thus able to remain in the background as Instructed. ,, The position at the time of writing this report is therefore that the subOTdinate Bor incident has been satisfactorily beared up, but the mam question of the Tarim slaves is far from settled. The first object, of excluding them from Tarim, in accordance with the sentence of banishment, has been temporarily accomplished, but their permanent deportation is far from assured. Sultan Muhammad has little authority to effect this. o Seiyid Alawi bin Ubeid Al Aidarus a resident of the 01 Al Falluga of Al Tamim has for some time been in dispute with his cousins over property. Seiyid Bubakr is anxious that the man should be arrested and Bireiki Muhammad Qasir has offered to accompany the soldiers in carrying out this work. The matter is at present under consideration between Seiyid Bubakr, F. A*R. A. and i . 8 regard to possible repercussions as it is felt that All bin Awadh bin Falluga the worst of the Tamimi , badmen , may be m the affair*. 640. A meeting of the unofficial Kathiri State Council was held on 30th September.~J ** while he does not wish to condone v/ith any arbitrary measures to which Sultan Husein may have had r course* they must realise that no administration could function smoothly without taxesv.'&amp;nd that unless and until Habbanis would agree to pay sufficient taxes to meet the cost of such administration there was little possibility of resisting such levies by the Sultans every now and again., It was also stressed that anyone who encourages or supports outside interference or intrigues in Habban would find little sympathy at the Residency. Certain possible measures to improve the situation in Habban were discussed and the two Seiyids promised their co-operation in settling the troubles at Habban. This Mansab and certain of the A1 Mihdhar Seiyids were among those who opened their houses to the Aulaqis during their recent raid on Habban and there Te reasons to believe that their trip to Mukalla may have been with the intention of finding the attitude of the authorities towards them. 651. After insistent reminders over a period of months to the Managers of Schools in Wah'idi country s one of the three sfthools that of Hauta has at last consented to send a teacher to Mukalla to follow the training course for teachers held under the supervision of Sheikh Gaddal Seiyid Gaddal.

In the interview, after the usual protestations of friendship,. Abdulla complained of the stoppage of the privileges previously granted to Bir Ali, The R-A, replied that this was probably due to the attitude of the late Sultan Nasir bin Talib to the Government and his misunderstanding the position, ^ All that the Government wished to do was to a.ssist the people of Bir All and encourage them to establish security and good government. The R 0 A 0 did not wish to force upon then any administrative measures that would not be supported by the Sultan and dispeoples Abdullah said he would return to Bir Ali to inform his fattier about the interview and would try to persuade him and other Bir Ali Aqals to visit the RoA. after Ramadhan. 653. It is reported that the A1 Adlim have sought the Sultan of Ahwar’s help against the Gashuiri at Radhom, and that he has promised to lend then a gun but has asked for two hostagej and £ 700 as a guarantee for its return. The Political ' Officer i/c Western Aden Protectorate has been asked to advise the Ahwar Sultan not to encourage A1 mdhm intrigue. 651,o The A1 Adhm are said to have served old bombing operation notices on the Gashuri and to have exploded dud R.

At the present moment the worst offenders are the Raowdhah tribe who are daily raiding their neighbours: they derived considerable kudos from the'troaty they signed w*th the Uukalla Givernment about Hajr and,as thet reaty is fairly recently they dare not at present raid Ou’aiti territory, and are concentrating their efforts on Wadi Heifa’a, This is most unfortunate far as a result of their raids and counter raids by their victims, a number of fields cultivated by peaceful subjects have been destroye many of these subjects labourers employed at Lahej and other places had only recently returned to Wadi Meifa’a after the bombing and they are once r^ain leaving the rr adi for Lehej, Shaqra etc. 733 0 A few months ago the Mansab of Rudhom complained that the Al Adhm had occupied the t own and later that they had built a husn within the 'Hauta' there. While in Wahidi country Mr*Kennedy called at Rudhom and Heitha, the G-ashouri village, to enquire into the position. He was warmly received by all parties,: The Al A&amp;hm avowed intention is to prevent further Gashair infiltration in Rudhom and to secure payment by the Gashair of one fifth of the fine imposed on them (the Al Adhm) by HoMeG* two years ago,. This claim is made in virtue of a treaty of brotherhood between the two tribes although the Gashair consider the treaty moribund on account of the numerous murders between the two tribes since they cquarelled 40 years ago,. The Gashair ovn date groves near the town and some time ago built a husn within the Hauta to protect one of their groves from an adjoining husn belonging to an unfriendly Gashauri section: it was in reply to this that the Adhm erected their fort* It turned out after enquiry that the main trouble maker was Muqaddam Abdulla bin Hadi himself for some time back he nad sponsored an agreement among the Al Adhm to occupy Rudhom whose rich date groves ko covets and the Agils of the Al Kus and Al Obe^d sections had somewhat reluctantly subscribed to the proposal,, Abdulla bin Hadi evidently did not desire the other Agils to have the_r say and unsuccessfully tried to keep them out of tie way,, The Mansab's attitude is one of complete helplessness for he desires neither tlx Gashair nor the Al Adhm tobecome too powerful in Rudhom, but he evidently fears the latter more as they a re by far more numerous and powerful. Meanwhile he is suspected by both parties of intriguing with the othci nde,&gt; The situation was also discussed lengthily with the Gashair at Keith. As a result of those discussions Ali bin Ahmed bin I.o a jam, the only person accept phi o to both parties, was appoint c to arbitrate tne Al n In: G shourx differences* The Al Kus Muqaddam (Al Adhm) however iQ^usoa to accept Bin Laajam 5 s arbitration where upon Muqaddam Abdulla bin Hadi Adhm.' was requested t o deal with the dissenting muqaddam us he had mentioned Bin Laajam as a suitable person. Abdulla bin Hadi who had kept silent so far then denied having agreed to Bin Laajam. but by that time the other felt suspicious of his Rudhom venture in^cnticns^rc fu sed ect ions 7 who -operate with him in d returned to Ham, after destroying some houses they had occupied* According to the latest information Abdulla bin Hadi has only four supporters in Rudhom at present, all close relations of his&gt; Further efforts arc being made to get him to leave the place and it is hoped that in order to obtain the release of their hostages now in Mukalla the other sections will bring pressure to bear on him to return to Kamia 734. Habban* (I 589) Tho situation at Habban was carefully enquired intoTy Ur. Kennedy., He came to th r ' coi.olus.LoL that tho whole attack had been'planned beforehand and very likely financed by Ahmed pasir uleiwa. the prisoner* Sul-an Kssein bin Abdullah’s version of events was found to be substantially correct* Briefly~ 5 - there had been series of burnt 'sidah^in Habban c^id while the criminal responsible therefor could not be found, the epidemic was acutest when Ahmed iiasir Uleiwa and a close friend of his Ilahdi Obad Uleiwa were in residence. Last February some elb trees were found burnt and evidence received pointed to Ahmed ITasir Uleiwa as having financed the criminal c He refused Sultan's order to answer the clx.rce against him and sought the protection ox Bedus; but a month later the Sultan took advantage of a suitable opportunity to arrest him. V/ithin 24 hours^of his arrest 250 Awaloqs were in Habban requestinc his immediate release. Although it was evident they had come to make trouble, the flihdhar Seiyids opposed to the Sultan welcomed them in their houses, and supplied them with food and water and no doubt ammunition during their five days battle* They broke open about ten houses belongin' to the subjects, robbed everything of value and raped the women.' ■'ehidi supportors however soon came to the rescue and after the first night in tlx* town the attackers found themselves unable to leave: Sciyid Ali Hass an Al Jifri v/as sent from Yeshbum to arrange a truce, but Sultan Hussein who had already been cheated by the Al Jifri years ago refused to come to terms. With the help of Soiyid Al Hamil Al I.Iihdhar of Hhbban some of the bedu supporters of the Sultan were bribed to leave a sector of the town unguarded as a result of which the Awaleqs escaped during the early hours of the morning after remaining five days in the town* They lost one killed andtWo wounded, while the defenders suffered five casualties, The prisoner refused to answer Hr«Kennedy's Qucstions,prctcndc to bo ill and asked for one month's temporary liberty before trial. He is a nasty looking individual with sufficient contact with western legal procedure to be dangerous in a hot bed of intrigue like Habban: with the large fortune at his disposal he is^decidedlv dangerous individual. He is also suspected of strong Italian sympathies.^ neither he nor anyone in Habban advanced a claim of being Aulaqi subject and that argument has probably only been Aulaqi Sheikh to justify the raid* Sultan Hussein Pc&gt;Soed judgment against him for ton months imprisonment, five thousand dollars.fine and he was required to furnish Rs*1,500 to the Resident Adviser for good behaviour for a period of one year,. His associate Ilahdi obad was fined ^500, end Re* 500 security for 5°2- ^ or mic Yuur while six Ilihdhar seiyids who had been definitely proved of sympathising with the Awcloqs during the attack were fined between dollars 50 to 175^ The Mihdhar proved entirely unscrupulous crowd with no loyalty to the Sultan they had themselves selected a few years back or to the Awalcqs they wore harbouring. They arc responsible for two changes of regime# at Habban already within the past- 25 years and they have been made to understand that their roic of Sultan-Maker must come to an end* Every one in Habban thought the fine on the Sciyids much too low and the Sultan who had put in a ,bill for over /10,000 expenditure as^a result of the raid was greatly disappointed that Bm Uleiwa s fine was not increased,, in order to protect Habban more effectively against a possible recurrence of such attacks a project to build a wall round the town is at present under* consumer- : at ion. 735* (H 651) Four more teachers for the towns of Habban, Rowdha and Azzan and the village of Said Ba Gadr in Wadi Meifa'a in the Balhaf Sultanate have arrived at Mukalla to follow the Teachers course* There arc already schools at Habban and Rowdha: Azzan has so far no school although, like Seiyun, it possesses a learned Sharif, and it in proposed to build a new school^. Sheikh Fndhl Muhammad Ba Gadr has promised to supply a suitable building for a school in his village. 736. Arrangements are being made for the recruitment of two young boys as dispensers for training in Aden: they will bo stationed a t Habban and Hauta Bil Fngih Ali. 737, After considerable difficulty arrangements, wore completed for a. well digger to proceed to Balhaf after Ramadhan to dig a well below Husn Mcdnab: no water has yet been found at Balhaf but Mr. Beeby Thompson thought there might be a 'sporting chance' of finding water there.

To understand the occur reneea at Hau^a^AhmeSr^brn 2efn ft may 'be 'we TT to give ah short history of the place as a background to nresent events. About two hundred years ago rivalry for spiritual predominance was rife a.t Ghurfa between the Sheikhs of Al Ba Abbnd and Seiyid Ahraed bin Zein Al Habshi. For lack of support the letter lost ground pnd had to leave Ghurfa. He settled down at a &gt; 0-0 Called Sha r b Ra at time a well knov/n thieves’ nearby plawe ~ — -- , - . . r ■ ndez-v ous. The seiyid built a house and as time passed others were aitrao^ed to the place and settled down near him. By. his spiritual influence Seiyid Ahmed kept the settlement secure from tribal interference and owing to the high esteem in which he was held enemies would meet there without fighting*, thus the nla.ce became known as his sanctuary or Hautat Ahmed bin Zein Al Ha.bshi. When the founder died his successor as spiritual head assumed the title of Mansab and this has become hereditary. For many years the merchants and other townsmen (or 'meskin”) who settled there lived nuite cheerfully under the most rigid restrictions ruled cut to them by the seiyids, who considered themselves alone entitled to display and a, gay life. While the seiyids could wear whatever they li’^ed the meskin must go about in humble rags: green shawls and turbans were a perquisite of the seiyids: meskin women ^ must not decorate them selves with henna or attend the sherifas 1 parties: only small sized drums might be used at a meslin dance : hajir (shrill cries of joy) was the privilege of seiyids only and wedding eerie monies amongst meskin had to be of the simplest kind. About 25 years ago, however ; Seiyid ’Tima- b in ^ 'Abdulla Al Habshi became mansab and he removed most of the restrictions on the me skin who beg*n to realise what they had missed. The mansab's action was disaporoved by most of the seiyids who considered the meskins* gaiety and enjoyment an encroachment on their hereditary rights and nrivileges, so they approached the m^nsab proposing tha'it four of them should form a council with him, the idea of course being to control his actions, but the mansab refused and in this way an opposition party was formed. . ' ^ . It wns well known that the mansab could not protect the me skin so the opposition began interfering with them m order to exasoerate and humiliate the mansab, Uok'nown persons bur no iihe gauss of meskin hou-oes, rifle bullets would pierce the windows where meskin were holding a party, and no one could trace the offenders, In fact the dispute betweenjthe sieiyids *-e u omced an to the heads of .the November I94d a -.er? avis fight took place during a. no skin we ding celeoration a^d was only ended with the intervention of a tribesman, one of the Bin Ye man i family. Both parties lodged complaints with the Kathiri Sultan out the seiyids failed to appear for the hearing of the case and it was allowed to drop. The state of unrest, however, continued in Ha.uca, More gates ^were burnt and two months ago a car belonging no a seiyiu oi the opposition was burnt. Merchants, with their god owns fu'l of kerosene and other goods, were alarmed and many of nhem evacu.aieo u O be ly uu and Ts.rim, ^ In normal times Hautat Ahmed tin Zein has a population o, about 1500 and is a secondclass caravan centre.

The next morning he with his servant and escort were Said more prayers though hoped to make a parade £f his sanctity throughout the journey to MUKALLA but the bus was given orders not to stop in any village and the night put into the mail bus, but not before DABBAGH had ostentatiously more prayers though a crowd was not allowed to collect,, DABBAGH was spent in the open.

To this AHMAD BIN HABREISH replied xhpt he ^’a s ready f or a meeting but without an extension of truce he and his tribesmen were unable ^ to come. The State then agreed to ah extension of tr ,i ce of one month which was accepted by BIN HABREISH who came to DUFEI.OA with a detachment of the Had hr a mi Beduin Legion and the RESIDENT ADVISER went tc SHI HR to meet him on June I2th.

The .RESIDENT ADVISER told AHMAD BIN HABREISH that he saw no noint in further meetings of this kind r id that negotiations for the future could not be entered into except with an elected Munaddam: that AHMAD and any other BEIT : ALI were free to come and go as thev liked as long as they were of good behaviour: t t,t if discussions or advice were wanted the door was open and the R.A. and State representatives would always be ready to receive them: that if any BEIT 1 ALI committed an offence ail would be held responsible. BIN HABREISH said that if he were sufficiently 'insulted' he would be^ab&amp;e t ; sraange anything required. A few days latetf a letter was received seating that the BEIT 5 ALI were ready to agree to a truce on the follow ing conditions A 5 years truce with tha withdrawal of nosts from GHEIL BIN YOlvExN with the exception of HUSH LE1JUN, The granting of the usual privileges and customs to the BEIT ALI, A monthly salary to the Muoaddams, The pay men t of nahwa fees of Rs. 4 00 to AHlvE D BIN HABRBISH, Rs.4CX) to FARAJ BIN KARAMA and Rs ,2 00 to others.

( IOT5e) The news from BARI that Mr. EMERSON*s visit to RadHRA- IiAUT was not on behalf of the British Council but in order to p.ipare the ground for the raising of troops has caused much amusement in all circles. 2.

BLN ’ ABILT has constructed a kut on the SHI BA Mi side of the road near AL^GHURFA's western gate t and the acting F.A.R.A. wrote to him expressing the hope that he was not and ould not interfere with traffic on the roed a The piecing together of information from various sources results in the following ~s the reason for the added defences to AL GHURFA. About a fortnight before the RESIDENT ADVISER went to the HADHRAMAUT the Royal Mall van, which has been in store in MUKAILA for about two years, was brought out to be nut into commission and tested, and it was also stated that i' would accompany the R.A. to the HADHRAMAUT on a tria* run. One of BIN 'A*'DAT*.? snies in MJK/.LLA, pro- bably^AL JERU, then wrote to BIN 5 ABDAT that the R.A. was preparing a military expedition to go to the HADHRALAUT On receipt of this news BIN ;ABDAT placed iron bars across the road and built the kut referred to. Informers from AL wlERSF confirm that these erections were made with the sole intention of preventing the R.A* : s passage. On the R.A.'s arrival at AL Q;\T;f he was asked by MUSELLl (see 1058) where his soldiers were, which a ga in conf irms that AL GHURFA was ex- necting soldiers to come, though in fact the van was only carrying labourers for road improvements. II3I. It is thought in HADHRAMAUT that BIN 'ABDAT's influence will disappear with his cash resources, now seriously restricted, but though he is believed to have only about $10,000 left he has three or four houses stocked with gr^ in, ri^e, kerosene, ghee etc. probably enough to last about two ye^rs. It is interesting to note ths.t it is reported he has now reduced his HA MU MIS to 40, the lowest figure for a long t ime , AL MARA' I BINJTALIB TTBBM * After 1 s irr hours argument with len.d p rs of both sides the at ting F, A* R.A. settled the dispute betv/een AL SA ’ ID BIN MARA 1 I and AL SALAM B_N MIARA ! i and both ' Aoils d'^cide^ to call off the whole show and lunched amicably together.

The looting was in retaliation for several robberies suffered by Al Jufan at the hands of the Hamumis. Hone of the parties concerned complained to the Government, There was keen rivalry between the Naib of Shibam and £ It an ’Ali bin Salah to settle the case and the ITaib eventually succeeded in securing the return of the loot to Shibam, A curious feature of the case was that ba Matraf refused to take the rice back, although as consignor ho was still responsible for its safe delivery to bin ’Abdat; he said it belonged to bin ’Abdat and he would have nothing to dp with it. The rice was therefore delivered direct to bin ’Abdat from Shibam, 1271, The F.A.R.A. reports thr.t three of the ba Matrafs later called on him while he was in Qatn and said that they had acted on the traditional lines of the Hacauma.x.ut mercantile community in refusing to cooperate with the ITaib,over the return of the looted rice.

As the Rais was unable to shov/ that Beit All’s attitude h^d improved his proposals were ultimately rejected, 1326. On 10th October H.B.Lo Jundi TTo.5 Sahal Said Al Qarzi and Bo.30 Bubakr Salim bin Mas’ud Al Qarzi were shot, hilled and looted of their arms by two Beit Ali tribesmen in Gheil bin Yume in ; a iriend,, a tribesman of Beit Al Qarzat, who was with them, was also hilled. The killers were pursued by an H.B.L. patrol which caupht up with them after a fifteen miles’ chase and hilled then in turn. 1327. As a result of the killing Beit Ali automatically forfeit their riwht to enter Government towns and steps were taken at once in the v/adi Hadhramaut and on the coast to enforce this ban, Ahmad bin Habreish, one of the Beit Ali leaders, has already sent to the O.C,., II.

It is unlikely now that even the 0,0,, who was before inclined to be over§ym?athotic with Beit Ali, will bo willine to apree to this proposal* 1328. An important side issue of the hillinp is that Beit Al Qarzat, another Hamumi* section, are determined to avenpo themselves on Beit Ali for the death of their two men. They have already offered the O.C., H.B.L, any assistance he may require at Leijuri. AL JUHIYIIT: 1329.

Several of the doubtful characters of the tribe have for long been trying to strike a blow at Salim bin Ja*far’s position and this is undoubtedly the result of their intrigues* 1342* Having trapped Salim bin Ja’far and his party, the other Al Mara’i bin Talib tried to avoid signing the 'Peace', but Ubeid Salib, knowing this, paid a visit to Al Mara’i bin Talib country where he was cordially received by Salim bin Ja’far and their other Chiefs.

Later Mr. Kennedy interviewed Seiyid Hasan Al Jifri. 1410. After heariny this and the Wahidi point of view Mr. Kennedy summed up the position as follows (i) Althouyh no action has been taken ayoinst the Aulaqis for their surprise attack on Habban they are much worse off as a result oi it because its failure and- their ban from the town irritates them. They want to recover their ' sha.ruf 1 by securing; bin ’Uleiwa’s release. (ii) By releasiny bin ’Uleiwa Sultan Hussein be bound to suffer loss of what ’sharuf’ he has left of Ilabban would with the tribes. P.T. 0. . • • • • .,(iii) Ahmad Hasir4 . ( ) Ahriacl IJaBir bin 1 Uleiwa is probably beinr enconraged y some third party not to pay the fine. He is a-rich;-nan who could ^easily afford it. His status is that of ’’subject” v/ho has intrigued against his Sultan, and any sympathy extended to him would be so much encouragempnt to the numerous intriguers of Habban, Mr.^Kennedy therefore suggests the removal of bin ’Uleiwa to Lluhalla after he has deposited the fine of ^. 5,000 with the G-overnment and that the ultimate decision as to how much of the ne should pay be left with the Resident Adviser, 7 Idll, Mr, Kennedy adds that he made widespread enquiries in LciO.j&amp;n to ascertain whether the people would like to see the Aulaqis back either as rulers or as visitors. There was complete unanimity as to their undesirability as rulers and only a small ° f were prepared to welcome their return as visitors ihe majority thinly they will only cause trouble: they are not bona iae Pa. ei s anct v/ill only blackmail the inhabitants for money. Moreover, an Aulaqi would be bound to be shot sooner or later in Habban market in retaliation for their killin- Habbanis. ^ '■ PART II. - ADMINISTRATIVE. I* GENERAL: POOD POSITION: 1412.

This the poor considered to be sheer hypocrisy. They could not control their indignation and one of the merchants who gave Zakah to Government officials was pursued in the market place by an angry crowd of beggars who shouted after him that he had abused the custom of Zakah. The matter gained sufficient importance to compel the Chief Qa&amp;hi to. declare in the mosque in the presence of a large congregation that he had heard with regret of the merchants’ behaviour and emphasised that both the donors and receivers of such Zakah were wrong. 2, ADM II T IS T RATI VT: 1418.

The persuading; tl lease docuncnt com lission found ic Hukalla Secret that iriat v/hi ch mV r/e the syndicate had succeeded in to insert a small clause in the it entire rights over another piece of JLan'. called Ruwcikan. The addition.'of this clause was made in such a way as to convey the impression that Ruwcikan was an insignificant patch of ground of little or no a: rxcultural value. In I act it is a larpe area covering; much of the round bctvuen Gheil ba V/azir ana Snincir (8 miles av/sy) and including in. particular an area ox cultivation watered by another Mxiyan and owned by local cultivators^ Ly inserting the clause the syndicate hoped to dispossess these cultiva tors and'it was significant that when the land division started the syndic at e proceeded at once to this area iti Ruwcikan., In aaciition the syndicate had broken local custom by attempting go aiviae gIig lane, of Zahar before it had been watered; the custom is that only that land v/hich can be covered by the water is divisible, all that is not so covered remains the property of the Government, . -By a ma.jority^ decision the commission decided that no lane, should be divided until it had been seen what land was waterable and that the original cultivators of the coveted area of Ruwcikan should oe coniirmed in j . their possession, 1431 9 Mugaddam Ahmad Nasir disagreed with the decision and fought a losing battle which lasted deep into the night* His arguments were so specious that his enemies might have thought he had some interest in the syndicate* (1160), Similarly the AG. State secretary had should a marked reluctance in sending out any commission of enquiry wlu ^soever and had eventually to be 'advised'’ that a commission must be sent; he contended that the Governor of Ghcil was on the spot and was in control of the situation; it was therefore unnecessary to send out other Government officials'. Mr. Leslie learnt however at Gheil ba Wazir that the Mukalla Government had prevented the Governor having anything to do with the land distribution. In sum, there arc grounds for suspecting that the mo st influential elements in the Mule all a Secretariat conspired with the syndicate to defraud the Mukalla Govt t ■ 1432, Hamumi tobacco is now fetching excellent prices in Aden, roughly double*.the normal price.

GENERAL. 1473. In Seiyun the ’id al Haj was celebrated with the customary cere mony. The Sultan attended the ’id prayers in the Jumaa mosque in pro cession and afterwards a large crowd called at the palace to congratu late him, including Mr. Kennedy on behalf of the Resident Adviser and Mr. Cox the .!• A* 1474. Financial affairs in Tarim reached, a crisis recently when the ^ head of the slaves announced that commitments in respect of th© slaves rations could not be met. It was discovered that besides misappropria- ■'■ion cf funds by the si da a clonks, the two brothers Sultans Abdullah nd Muhammad bin Muhsin had been d awing drafts against the collector of takes at Tarim which the latter could not dishonour. Previously Sultan 7 Abdullah had been content with his income from Java but on this ceasing he was compelled? as he explained, to his irate brother, to claim his share of the Tarim revenue. After some days tension the two brothers agreed that one should be in charge and that both should re ceive sufficient to meet their expenses. Seiyid Bubakr Al Kaf was also called to the rescue and a new administration was suggested^under the supervision of Seiyids Mihdhar and Muhammad bin Hussein Al Kaf. As the, Al Kafs are fully aware that they will have to pay any shortages their interest is not unnatural* 1475. A Committee to examine the control of prices and foodstuffs met in Seiyun a.nd decided that all grain should be purchased by a central committee for resale at cost price to merchants. The margin of profit allowed to merchants on selling to the public was carefully left t unex- uloredc The Sultan agreed that all measures should bo inspected and stamped, which has been done, and it was proposed that the Committee should meet once a week but this is likely to prove too exacting for them. 1475 , Al Bahimeid, Sheikhs of Maduda, who have been in Seiyunjja complained to the Acting F.A.R.A* that their_houses were being plundore-cU There have been a number of major incidents in Maduda or its immediate neighbourhood during the past year and the Sultan is considering sending some slaves to garrison the village. 2 , TRIBAL. 1477,“^^e’id Salih’s position is generally believed to be f- 4 - precarious every day* It is stated that his funds are almost exhausted and that he obtained $ 0 2000 from A1 Grhur^a merchants loir forcing them to accept his own currency in exchange! for M* T, dollars.

ItT has been generally noted that during the latter part of 1942 there has been more peace among the tribes and more seeking after peace by their leaders than has prevailed since the termination of the truce in the early months of 1940# There has been a good deal of discussion as to the reasons for this and the part of the Mukalla Govt. Secretariat dealing with beduin affairs has seen fit to record the reasons which have been ipentionod# These are (1) ”Cessation of communications between East Indies and H^ahramaut”. This means that the well-to-co mischief makers have not the money to stir up trouble and there is not the jealously motive to encourage beduins to stir up trouble to try and get money.

PERSO NA LITIES 1684. (1474) $HE SULTANS OF TARIM. Sultan f Abdullah bin Muhsin is the second of 4 brothers and aged about 44* The eldest brother, { Abdul Qadir, is non compos mentis so 1 Abdullah is regarded as the head of the family. He refused to be ’'Governor’ 1 at Tarim preferring to devote his life to food, women and leisure, but considers himself os much entitled to a share &amp;£ in its revenues as his brother Muhammad who is the Governor* Fat, shinless, very dark skinned, -Abdullah ambles through life, always cheerful and though of weak intellect and a poor conversationalist his house is the rendez-vous of all the interesting characters in the neighbourhood. He is by far the most popular of the Sultans among the Shenafir tribesmen west of So-yum Q; Although : Abdullah does not go to the extent cf beheading his wives he nas a touch of Henry VIII about him and divorces them fairly regu larly,, He has had 38 wives so far and hopes to marry many mere* Besides innumerable love affairs he always keeps the full complement of 4 wived. His matrimonial adventures led him into rivalry with 'Ubeid Salih bin ’ Abdat as they both sought the hand of 'Awadh bin Azzarh s daughter but neither of them su ;eeedeic f Abdullah frequently visits Sciyid ; Abdul Rahman bin ‘iToeidillah As Saqqaf, a well known local intriguer, but he is undoubtedly friendly to the British and for a long time gave one of his houses to the R r A- to be used as an offices His knowledge of the outside world is limited to Mukallao Unreliable, suffering from chronic laziness, on the whole he remains a likeable individual! who has shown determination on occasions and his personality should not be ignored as he might prove useful in in nnectien with the unification cf the future, more particularly Tarim and Soiyurn Sultan Muhammad bin Muhsin, third of the 4 brothers, is about 38 and was recognised as Sultan ox* '‘Governor•• or Tarim seme 20 years ago by an arrangement made between the Sultans* In spite of this he spends all his time in Soiyun as he is in fear of the Tarim slaves and has no interest in Tarim affairs. At the slightest difficulty he runs for help to Seiyld Bubakr A1 Kaf CcB* S 5 who., with other A1 Xafs, virtually run Tarim (see para 1474). He has never travelled beyond Shibam. Badly educated, with no conversation, he has no personality and his blood stained, pepping eyes give an impression of mental deficiency. ’'Lean and hungry” was Philby l s description of him. He never moves without a heavy automatic carried well in evidenceo He has married a number of wives and at present has 2 on the strength. There is an old feud between his branch and A1 Mansur (the Seiyun branch) and a fillmex was-reached in I9S7 when Sultan Ahmad 'bin Ja’faD? .shot one of Sultan Muhammad’s slaves.

He encouraged them to increase their imports of foodstuffs by jointly placing o large order rather than to continue •choir present method of separate orders to their various agents. The appeal had a very good response and a sum of Rsr. 60 ? 000 was there and then raised by aibscriptions and order for large quantities of foodstuffs will soon be placed. ^ Merchants in Dis and Kami were likewise advised and a subscription list of fund was ouened but the total collection is not yet known. Most of the land in Dis is under date groves and there 1 b not sufficient space for a wide cultivation of other crops* Thore ore however patches of land scattered here and there which arc being usod for planting different crops according to the needs of farmers* The State Secretary advised the famers to concentrate on cultivating one crop at a time on these patches as by so doing a good harvest of a particular crop would thus be obtained. The farmers fcpporently agreed* * The State Secretaly inspected theRaudha water spring which is the source of Kami water supply* The aqueduct is narrow and the flow of water is somewhat obstructed by long standing deposits* The State Secretary advised its expansion and repair* The share holders in the spring promised ■&amp;o carry out the work by raising funds themselves* Ho idot Abdul Wodud* The agricultural land in this district is all under foodorops. The farmers have done exceedingly good work and it is estimated that the harvest of grain will be sufficient for the people of Rcidat for the greater pars of a year* 1711* The Yafa*i Muqaddams not Ln service and. other unemployed + v! have been informed by the State Secretary that their request to hold arms without a licence cannot be entertained asit is against the 3a w and they were told they must therefore register their arms and obtain a licence for theme 2* ADMINISTRATIVE . 1712* (1604) The total quantity of petrol sold for consumption in March was 13 drums and 33 oases amounting to 1044 gallons, 1713* Fishermen went on strike for two days as a pretest against the fees charged in the now fish market (para 1662)*' However they have since settled down to their now quarters? the strike was broken by on organisation of fish supplies from outside and the local fishermen found they could not sell except in the market* 1714. There is trouble browing among the slaves who are refusing to comply with orders to hand in their arms or take out licences for them. ^ On their refusal the State Secretary ordered that the issue of their koila should be suspended* it is reported that they wore threatening to beat up their Muqaddoms* They arc said to have gone to the Yafa f i Muqaddams and enquired whether they would be prepared to enter the. lists against them and Muqrddam. wAnlmABGoadi is reported to hove convinced them thr.t he end the others would not hesitate to ohey Government's orders even if they hod to ’'cut the slaves up into smell pieces* ” There appears to he little . sympathy for the slaves in the town end comments ere that ’'they canH go on eating Government money end doing nothing 1 ', thet they are 'the State pigeons' and that they should he forced to work and sent to garrison outposts* 1715* Owing to the rise in prices of certain commodities H*H* the Sultan has approved new rates in the customs tariff affecting the following imported articles* rice, sugar,tea, ground nut, simsim and oocoanut oils, jaffal,coffee, till seeds, condiments and spices, coconuts, grey sheeting, matches, carpets and rugs, waras harori, date juice, date stones, shark liver oil, old newspapers and twist cotton. Export goods affected ore honey, safif, shark fins, shark liver oil, dates, onions and garlic* The increased duties range from As. 2 on such articles as tea, oils and date juice etc. to Rs.40 on grey sheeting, hut in most cases the increase is slight. 1716* The construction of a motor road from Riynn to Wadi Felc&lt;l has hecn completed* This was the worst part of the track he tween Riyan and Mukallo and its improvement was undertaken in agreement with the Air Ministry who agreed to pay half the cost while the Mukallo Government paid the other half. 1717. As long ago as September 1941 the State Council agreed that a Committee should he appointed to enquire into the passihility of n tax on date palms in coastal areas. For one reason or another the Committee did not meet until quite recently and its report now heen submitted and agreed upon.

The AL EUDDA, a section of AL ’ AMR clan of the KA Till Hi tribe have been giving a great, deal of trouble recently in WADI HADKRA&amp;AUT, looting and intercepting travellers. Among &lt; other things they have looted almost half the kharif (dare harvest) of BHIBaM. They have relation with BIR ‘ABDAT of AL GEJRRA who has been suggesting that he could settle the matter, but on the other hand he may be instigating them. As a Kathiri tribe it is up to the Kathiri State to deal with them with the cooperation of the Mukalla Govt, and it is satisfactory to record that the former has made some effort in this respect by sending out patrols to the area concerned. The R.A. has told the State Secretary of the Seiyun Govt, that the matter cannot be satis factorily desalt with unless and until all the Kathiri sections combine in helping to sew up a central Govt, over Kathiri territory, and it would be well to seek their cooperation in putting down these dis orders.

However Mr. KENNEDY visited QISHN again on 21st September in company with Mr. BALL and a site was chosen some 3 miles east of Q, I SHIT and two miles from the coast. The Sultan was very m &gt; IT', i » LCA U 'esirous of helping Govt, but he expleined that lir other Sultans, numbering 30, would have to be consulted. The choice of a site some way from the town is likely to meet with more approval than one near the town as both Sultans and people viewed with reluctance the possibility of a more extensively used landing ground near QISBR itself and they are verp suspicious regarding the construction of any buildings A suggestion was made that some compensation in the form of a stipend might be paid bim it was made cleat' to the Sultan that no payment had ever been made for any landing ground in the E.

It ? !has progressed 37 miles from the junction and is within sight of the WADI HA JR. It is proposed that a branch to NIJSIDIN where the Mans a'b of the Deiyin lives should be made, a distance of about 10 miles* The condition of Deiyin children seen was deplorable and arrangements are being made to send some relief there* 2366. The R. A* inspected the MUITALLA-MDIDA road on 21st April. Cars can now get to within half a mile of the village of BURUM v/here there is still much blasting to be done, but beyond the village the work has progressed about 7 miles. 2367, Transport .of _Grain v In order to facilitate and speed up the transport of grain to the main wadi, H. Q. British Forces Aden/obtained permission xrom M. B. to provide aircraft for transporting erain from RIYAN to QATH landing ground* By the end of the month a start had been made and Wellington aircraft were transporting about 250 bags a day though on some days this was much exceeded* This generous assist^ ’snce has been much eppredated by the public. 2368. During March in order to ensure the continual supply of grain to the interior from the coast a camel transport control^department yae ^t in MUKALLA with a branch in SHI HR* A meeting attended by leading merchants was held when the organisation of the distribution and transport of grain was arranged* The interior was divided into a number of areas, e* g. Seiyun area, A1 Ghuraf ares, Tariio. area, Shibam area, etc«. and .merchants selected to be responsible for supplying each area* The quantity of grain to be allotted monthly to each area was also settled. The Mukalla Govt, issued - a notice in which it re*** ^uired all beduins with transport camels to register them at the camel transport control dept, either in Mukalla, Shihr or elsewhere; all merchants or others requiring’ camel transport to obtain it only through the Dept* The Dept, to allocate the transport and priority to be siven to food supplies, the rates to be fixed by govU,and finally the public were warned that anyone engaging camel transport otherwise than through the Dept, or paying higher than the controlled rates would be liable to imprisonment. The merchants responsible for supplying the areas were warned that the first consideration was the supply c£ grain to the starving people and that all camels would be primarily engaged for this purpose and after that had been satisfact orily dealt with the transport of other commodities could be considered The work of the Dept* proved satisfactory and full cooperation was forthcoming from merchants, beduin brokers etc. The only handicap was the lack of camels due to the drought. But the rise in price owing to the withdrawal of the subsidy caused a considerable falling off in the quantity of grain purchased for sending up country and this at the time of writing has not yet picked up. The result will probably be to reduce those who could purchase subsidized grain to the level of relief* 2369. (2317) In order further to increase camel transport enquiries were made as to the possibility of obtaining camels from RBIDAT AL ! ABDUL WADUD and the MAHRI coast* A reliable merchant who is landing ground agent at RUIDA, Sheikh Taha Ba Humeid, at an interview faith the RAA. on 3rd April stated that from 80 to 100 camels could be obtained from RBIUA from Manahil, Jireiri, Amqi and Symahi beduins* He con sidered that these camels were probably being used between SHIHR and the interior at present as that route is easier for them than the one from REIDA on which there are some difficult passes. Nevertheless Sheikh Taha thought the beduins might prefer to use the REIDA route as it was the■r own locality but would probably require a higher rate* He stated that about half the REIDA oamels in sound enough health to carry loads to the interior. As regards the transport of grain from the MAHRI coast to the interior Sheikh Taha said that camels could not be obtained from SEIHUT (from which place he had just returned) as the beduins there are not hiring their camels for trans port. he though'- possibly Kathiri and Manahil camels- might transport from SEIHUT providing there was a truce between them and the Zueidi tribe whose terrain is in and around SSIHUT. In such a case from 30U to 400 camels might be found* 2370, neighbor i The 0.0. ASAKIR was also notified that camel owners in that hood should be asked if they would transport grain to various- 6 «~ localities in HADHR^MiiUT at the ruling rates hut up to the middle or the month.he had not 'been able to obtain any* 2371. Camel prospects generally were discussed with leading merchants and beduins and the following were the opinions expressed# ^ ibout two thirds of the area supposed to prov *.de the 1500 camels monthly for transport from MUKhLLf* has had rain and during the next 4 months the nuihbor of ca'oels parrying is likely to decrease by about one half 5 becouse (a) grasing will be good and beduins will not want to lose the opportunity of renting and feeding their camels, (o) the summer season begins in May and eveft in normal times, transport camels ere fewer owing to the prevailing best* They considered that in May the beduins will graze their camels, in June and July th£ heat and the beginning of the kharif will keep them in the hills and in .August all beduins atrend to the kharif. On the other hand they expressed the view that with the rain existing camels will be saved from aeath fend if it rains in .August there |s every likelihood of their numbers increasing gradually. From SH1H3 reports are much the same* It is expected there that beduins will now want to graze their camels after the rain but that numbers might increase in the middle of May until the kharif. The condition of camels in the SHIHR area is reported to be good on the whole. But taking the country as a whole reports have it that about two thirds, of the camel population, equivalent to half the working camels, has been killed by drought* Flocks have suffered equally heavily ana areas in which there is now grazing are very empty. Formerly after rain many flocks were seen on the DU’oAII road, but on this occasion tnere are very few. 2372. On I7th April the H. A* spent the day at SKIHR inspecting the work of the camel transport control dept., the customs, the relief works such as the newly opened ,, malos u which had over 40 patients being treated and fed, and the food kitchen serving about 300 men, wd men and children. 2373 c A food kitchen was opened in JtQREIDHA at the beginning if the month. The population of this town, who are mostly seiyids, are without means _•£ support and have no ’work as cultivation is poor in this area. Previously they lived on remittances from the Bast Indies. So accustomed are they to sit and do nothi ig chat they were not at first even prepared to fetth firewood for cooking the grain which govt, was supplying them free together with dates. However they now produce the cooks and firewood and water while H. M. G. does the rest. During the first week the average osily issue of grain was 3651b. and of dates 57 lb. The R. A. asked the Famine Relief Commissioner if ho would be prepared to take over this kitchen but owing to lack of transport and the demands of the main wadi he had not been-able to t so bytthe end of the montin 2374# In order further to assist the Hadhramaut farming class it is proposed to grant land to families in the MBIFA delta of the WADI HAJR. Five families arrived in MUKALLA prepared to settle there and the jfiaixxsfxisasxIncrKSSFA llukalls Govt, is giving them plots of land in MBIFA and loans to help them in the initial stages. 2375. Cultivators in Hadhramaut nave shown much zeal following the advances of govt, grain now being issue-d. Repairs to the Huors dam, situated bel :w QASM the Tamimi capital, and the Shuhuh .. am are in progress. 237S.

EAi.uINS RELIEF : 2660 The improvement in the famine situation which was reported (2628) previously has not been maintained and by the end of the month there were signs of deterioration. The two main ^eas'ns for this were: (a) that the ”shitta i; crop was on the whole poor having been considerably damaged by attacks of a harvest pest locally known as 'Hawat 11 ^ (b) that the cold weather needed for/good/wheat crop had not materialised and since the phase of the 'last star' had begun with the wind blowing intermittently from the South the ' J outlook at the close of the month was not promising. Reports of flying locusts added to the insecurity= Every step was taken to deal with the latter. 2661 There were also certain indications of an increase in the famine conditions; as anticipated, amongst the leisured- classes. For example, no less than 8 or 9 Seiyids were working at Nuqra whilst appli cations were being received from others. The fact that these men had reached the stage of accepting manual labour showed clearly the serious ?/T/0. — li, 1til »«2 if conditions amongst this class# The recent registrations of adults at the Soup Kitchens *as a 'rush job' because of changes, illness and shortage of staff. As such it has proved unsatjsfactory there being too many opportunities for chicanery in obtaining two or more identification discs and then re-selling one* Certain hardships likewise were caused by women being absent, working in temporary jobs, whilst the particular kitchen ■which they attended was registered.

Mr# Fletcher spent some time at G-heil Ba Va gir which is now the educational centre of the Mukalla G-overnment and whi^o contains besides the Intermediate School, Primary Schools and qadhi’s Rubat. One of the Primary Schools is being used for experimental teaching. Teachers 1 ^graining Courses are also being developed on Bakt-er-Rubha lines. After a year's absence Mr. Fletcher was also much struck, by the improvement in the health of the children at the Children's Village outside Mukalla, and. by the advances which have been-made in-teaching them,crafts'on which they may be employed ih later life. Mr. Fletcher considers the work in this school has shown that such-a school, can be most successful. He also coauented on the real spirit of enthusiasm in the Beduin Schools especially in the Boys School. Vvith regard to Adult Bduoation Kir* Fletcher, said that surprisingly good progress had been, made amongst the humbler rort of workmen, many sihudrotwo months being able to read and write qui-i;e adequately and to do simple arith- metic. ^ On the whole ilr.

From the beginning of January 1941 to the end of May 1941 the reports are weekly. From June 1941 they become monthly. The reports are composed by the Resident Adviser, based in Mukalla.Each report consists of an update on the political and tribal affairs of the statelets that make up the Eastern Aden Protectorate, including:the Qu'aiti State of Shihr and Mukalla;the Kathiri State of Seiyun;the Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Sokotra;the Wahidi Sultanate of Bir Ali and Balihaf;the Shaikhdom of Irqa and Haura;the Indeterminate Area.News from neighbouring countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and the Western Aden Protectorate was also sometimes included.From April 1942 the reports expand and include important summarised information on finances, education, medical matters, food security, shipping, military and naval matters, agriculture and fisheries, meteorology, internal security, the effects of the war, and slavery.Most likely due to shortages of paper during the war, the reports are sometimes printed on the back of old documents and maps, including a map of Britain and Europe showing an idealised interpretation of Britain's targets and progress in the Second World War. The title ('Britain - The Spear of Attack') and labels are written in Arabic. There is also a page of text referring to a map of shipping routes (not present) and promoting the work of the Royal Navy and its allies. It is likely these were used as propaganda to garner support in the Arab Middle East.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hadhramaut</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000152#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
