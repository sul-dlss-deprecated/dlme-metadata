Translation of a letter from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Shaikh Mahomed bin Abdullah, son of the Ex-Chief of Bahrein, dated 27 January 1855.The enclosure explains that it is the opinion of the British Government that his continued residence at Demaun is not compatible with the maintenance of peace in the Persian Gulf; it recommends he should accept the proposal made by the Chief of Bahrein for his future maintenance, and move to Koweit [Kuwait].2. Translation of a letter from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Ameer Fysul, Wahabi Chief, dated 27 January 1855.The enclosure informs the Wahabi Chief that the Resident — acting for the British Government — has called on the sons of the Ex-Chief of Bahrein to quit Demaun, and to move to some other quarter. It further invites the Chief to cooperate with the British in promoting this objective.3. Letter from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Commodore George Robinson, Commander of the Indian Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf, dated 27 January 1855.The enclosure is suggesting that the Commodore delivers enclosures Nos. 1 and 2 via the HC Schooner
                           Constance; it notes that the services of the Agent at Bahrein, Hajee Jassem, should prove useful. It further mentions that the Resident has been authorised to intimidate to Ameer Fysul that further interference in the affairs of Bahrein will not be tolerated by the British.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000035#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
