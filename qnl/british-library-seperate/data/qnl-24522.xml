The letter contains comments alongside the paragraph's by Colonel Phayre and Merewether's opinions that many of the comments made by the Colonel are unjust and unfair to Captain Harrison and that his report shows a satisfactory state of affairs and great improvement of the condition of the country as compared to prior years. Merewether's comments also cite correspondence from other frontier officials which support statements made by Captain Harrison and his full support of the concluding paragraph of Captain Harrison's letter and his regret at observing Colonel Phayre's note affixed to the paragraph as well as his opinion that Captain Harrison deserves great credit for his work in Khelat.Letter No.1110 of 1870 from Colonel Robert Phayre, Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind, Jacobabad to Captain Charles Henry Harrison, Political Agent, Khelat, 21 July 1870 requesting further information on several points in the Captain's report (No.29 of 1870) before it is submitted to Government, discussing Captain Robert Sandeman's visit to Kahun and the way in which this had been reported to the Khan, and accusing Captain Harrison of having been enlisted by the Khan to carry out his own aims with regards to certain tribes. The letter also contains comments by Colonel Merewether in regards to its contents including his own opinion that Captain Harrison had appropriately reported news that had been given to him, which Colonel Phayre had objected to; that Captain Harrison was best placed to report on the Khelat troops at Lus Beyla [Bela] and that Colonel Phayre was basing his opinion on what was 'generally believed' instead of accepting the Captain's account; supporting Captain Harrison's decision to turn his conversation with the Khan away from the question of Captain Sandeman's visit as not only as Colonel Phayre not informed the Khan of it, he ad also not given the Captain permission to discuss it, and also stating that the exploring expedition had nothing to do with Captain Sandeman's visit despite Colonel Phayre's claims otherwise. Merewether also raises his concerns over the wording used by Colonel Phayre in regards to relations with Khelat and the Murrees and Boogtees and records his dissent against any possible plans the Colonel may have to contemplate action against those tribes without the Khan's consent. Merewether also contests the 'partizanship' which Colonel Phayre accuses Captain Harrison of, and states his opinion that the Captain has fully endorsed the spirit of the treaty with Khelat. The letter concludes by noting that much of Colonel Phayre's comments and opinions are still based on the incorrect views expressed by Colonel Phayre in 1869, which despite having been corrected on in several correspondence, he still appeared to pursue.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000009#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
