COX, c.i.e., H. B. M.'s Consul and Political Agent, MUSCAT, To POLITICAL HBSIDBNT in the PERSIAN GULF. Dated Muscat jJune L9Q3. Sir, I -think you are aware, from previous reports, that, from various causes, the Sultan's finances have of late been at a low ebb. In this connection I have more than once begged His Highness to give me his confidence and seek my advice, and not to go raising money from all and sundry. On the strength of what I had said to him I have reason to believe that he did forthwith hand back a sum of 2,000 or 5,000 dollars which he had borrowed through a middle man from one Ahmed Dheybah, a Bahreini, trading in Muscat who has always been closely connected with Go- guyer and Mahomed Abdul Wahab of Darein, and since then I had some reason to hope that his finances were improving. It is therefore with the more regret that I have now the honour to report that I learn from an unimpeachable source that last week, when Shai4 al M Wahab passed throug Mus- /■v cat by the mail from Bombay on his way home, he called on the Sultan and offered to make him a loan of 18,000/- dol lars, which the Sultan accepted. When Abdul Wahab was not withHb with the Sultan he was closeted on the mail steamer with Goguyer and the man abovementioned, Ahmed Dheybah, and my informant believes and I myself have no doubt.. whatever, that Mahomed Abdul Wahab was put up to this by Ooguyer and that it is really only a be- nai transaction, and that Goguyer is the real lender: for pur poses of his own. The circumstances are such that if I were to give the Sultan the slightest hint of what I knew, he would at once know who my informant was, I therefore venture to sug gest that as soon as possible, and if you see no objection, you will be so good as to address a letter to His Highness or di rect me to inform him from you something to this effect:- ' That whereas Mahomed Abdul Wahab passed up the Gulf last ' mail, a local report has reached me with regard to him ' that on his way through Muscat he visited Your Highness ' and offered you a loan of money which was accepted. That 'as Your Highness has been specifically warned that Mahomed ' Abdul Wahab is not a desirable person for Your Highness M to have intimate relations with, I trust there is no ' truth in the information which has reached me, but in ' case there should be some foundation for it I deem it 'advisable to intimate to Your Highness that in my opinion ' you would be extremely ill-advised in entering into ' such a transaction with him or to borrow money either ' from him or through him and if anything of the sort has ' taken shape I trust to hear from the Political Agent at ' an early date that you have freed yourself from such a ' regrettable obligation,' If before receipt of your reply I receive similar information from bazaar sources upon which I can approach the Sultan with out betraying my informant I shall do so, but, failing that, a communication from you on the lines suggested would give the desired opening. It is almost inconceivable that the Sultan after his past and present experiences of Goguyer, should descend to borrowing moneyOOOVia / ^ I money from him or from any source with which he is connected, but, unfortunately, when Seyyid Feisal is in difficulties for money there can, I fear, be no certainty as to the sources from which he does or does not get it, I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, &lt; Major, H.B.M.'s CONSUL &amp; POLITICAL AGENT: MUSCAT, ^ -v C ^ fa h- ^ ^P. ft. 1 Um.

POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. / ** Dated Muscat, ^ f - July 1-90^ Sir, In continua-bion of this office letter No. 269 dated 15th June, on the subject of a loan believed to have been made to the Sultan by Shaikh Mahomed Abdul Wahab of Darein, I have the honor to report that His Highness having returned from his cruise in the 'Noor-el-^Bahr' on the 15th instant I called on him on the 15th and in the course of my interview broached the matter to him in the manner suggested. 8. His Highness frankly admitted that such an of fer as had been reported had been made to him by the in dividual under reference, but declared that he had unhesi tatingly rejected the offer. My original information was that the amount of the loan had been handed over on th e spot in currency notes, and prima facie it is somewhat difficult to believe that Seyyid Peisal would have refused such an offer if it had been made to him. On the other hand it is possible His Highness may have been speaking the truth and he certainly did not seem to be the least non-plussed or uncomfortable at my inquiries. In— iBfeSijSSu.. \ J In any case 'the incidents gave me an opporiyunit/y ot intiroduc* the subject of his indebtedness generally and of impressing upon him the folly of placing himself in the hands of such people, when he had several among his own subjects who could and would help him out of any temporary difficulty. He admitted that he had been somewhat in difficulties of late lor reaay money for current expenses, but added that such a condition was nothing new to him and did not exist to an extent which made it worth while troubling me with the matter. If he had done so, he con tinued, his action might have looked like a hint for further help from Government, whereas he was already heavily indebted to them and paying more than half his subsidy in liquidation of his obligations. In conclusion he assured me that he was in no serious difficulty and that if he was he would consult me and not do anything unwise. He asked me to inform you to that the foregoing effect and assure you he had not actually bor- a rowed the money, A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the foreign Department.

(3) The coal consumption of the 'Noor -el- Bahr' is very small and her annual requirements would not, I imagine, amount to any considerahle figure, and for the present at any rate would not necessitate anyalteration in the amount annually indented for by this Agency, oreover, as I think the Government of India is aware / Seyyid Feisal has always been most accommodating to us n the matter of our own depot at the Makulleh Cove, where lie allows us to do exactly as-we please, so that it will perhaps he considered politic to comply with His Highness's request and^let him have the coal at whatever it costs us to put down, including cost of landing.

His Highness sent me a message reQuesting me kindly to have an examination made by tehe Engineer Officer ,of H.M. s/ M Lapwing' which was in port at the time. This was done, .Captain Oldham &amp; 1 accompanying the Engineer who, at the conclusion of his inspection, made to me a verbal report to the effect of the enclosed. 1 called upon His Highness the nelxt morning &amp; told him that there was nothing seriously wrong, &amp; that the Commander of the Lapwing would send me a written Report which if necessary I would forward to .Oovernment. The Sultan was quite satisfiedwith this, &amp; ttonfeed me, but, suggested that if there was any thing radically wrong with the Steamer perhaps the .Government would lower the price to be paid tor her. In reply to this I repeated that there did not appear to be anything serious the matter. It appears to me unfortunate tnat this should have happ ened so soon after the issue of the vessel to His Highness,&amp; I cannot help thinking that possibly under the ci^cuiiistances the Government of India might prefer that the plates should- caulked (as suggested by the Commander of the Lapwing) at our expense.

With reference to my letter No.45S of today's date I have the honour to report separately, for facility of re cord, that Just before he left for the Bafineh Coast last night the Sultan sent me word, by a confidential messenger, to the effect that in view of the calls he was likely to have made upon him in connection with Aysa bin Saleh's raid upon Rosta-v he feared that he might be obliged within the next few days to ask urgently for an advance of Rupees 80,000/- of his subsidy, to be repaid by monthly deductions, and begged me to arrange it if possible. His position is such that if he is placed in difficulties in connection with Rostak, and cannot get money from us he will be driven elsewhere. I therefore recommend that if the request be confirmed the advance be sanctioned and am telegraphing accordingly. 2, Should the Government of India see their way to com ply they may think the opportunity now afforded a good one for addressing Seyyid Feisal upon the manner in which his finances are conducted or of making specific proposals to him. 5.

I. M. S. 'Hardinge' at 1-15 P. M. after the Durbar Investiture. Colonel Kemball, Resident in the Gulf, Major Cox, Political Agent, Maskat, and Mr. Dane, Secretary Foreign Department were present. His Excellency invited the Sultan to state freely and without reserve any subjects which he desired to bring to notice. The Sultan at first said that he did not wish to trouble His Excellency about anything. He did not anticipate any further trouble about Hostak. Of course he might have again to appeal to His Excellency for assistance but he wanted nothing at present. After some further conversation he said that there were two small points that he would like to mention. .First he hoped that we^e- His Excellency would again bring to OJLa, sS *JA. notice the case of his cousin ,, who was presented to His Excellency at the interview at the Sultan's Barza (Durbar room) and who was removed from Zanzibar for intriguing against the present Sultan in favour of Sayad Khalid on the death of Sayad Burghash. He load now been away from his home for six years and his wife declined to live at Maskat • He wished accordingly to return to Zanzibar or at any ra^e to be allowed to go there for a few months to see his wife and would give any guarantees that Government might ask. His Excellency pointed out that about two years ago he had moved in the matter but without success, ne could i^ot now promise that the Zanzibar authorities, wno were not under k his orders, would waive their objections. Still, on the under standing that H ilal bin J Iaaar wished to go for purely for domes tic reasons, and would accept any reasonable condi oioris thao /V,, m.*■&lt;■**** C/ ■ / '^ ^ ^ v ^C'Wv . vM™ might 5? p' ;rz- 4 I .» a , ■ if '31 1 , Pmight be imposed, he would see what could be done in the ma ter. secondly tne oiiltan asked that some mercy might be shown to the ouri slave dealers, who were captured in 1902 by tne Portuguese and had recently been sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment on the west coast of Africa. Some 20 had already died and it would De better to kill them outright than to keep them in such detention. His Excellency pointed out the case was one O j . slave raiding ol the worst type, and it would be hopeless i&gt;o .move ao present. The Sultan might however mention it again before His Excellency's term of office expired and he would see what could then be done. The Sultan thanked His Excellency for his replies and accepted his advice on the second question. Major Cox was then asked if he wished His Excellency to speak to the Sultan on any point. Major Cox suggested that it would be well if the Sultan were to employ a financial exper competent Committee to audit his accounts. His revenue was practically provided b3r the Customs; but the Sultan was in the habit of drawing against the receipts as/ though they were a bank account without qny any enquiry or knowledge as to the balance, if indeed such existed. The result was that he never knew hi s/ income and was habitually overdrawing. His Excellen cy pointed out to the Sultan that the step thus recommended was riecessary in the case of every Government and particularly necessary in the Sultan's case as lie had himself told His Ex cellency that he did not know what his revenue was. His ; 11 a j'of' drawing ch^^lle^''oh~ his 1 Excellency reminded the as B^^rtnicaiywhether there was a balance jj 3 credit or not was radically unsound { Sultan that he had at sr honest the Superintendent might be. f ^ L resisted the re form of taking his customs out of the hands of the farmers; and yet he would be the first now to admit that he had profited greatly by taking the Viceroy's advice. The same results would ensue from the further step which the Viceroy now proposed. The Sultan said thatthat lie could not well introduce another change so soon. The Hindu i esiaen uS V;ei e c ^I t eady annoyed at losing the Custoin.s contrac o and v/ould be set against him. Besides he trusted his pre senCustoms cupcnntendent a,r&gt;dj &gt;as his revenue was always in deficit, the audit of his accounts would not help much. All would cone right in the time of his son Sayad Timur, when the Government of India could do what they pleased. His Excell ency replied that he hoped it would be years before there was any question of a successor to His Highness and that the matter was of the greatest importance. If this was to be the argument employed why should not the Viceroy postpone the consideration of the Sultan's requests until his own successor came. The Sultan smiled and was understood to say that he would do what he could, and Major Cox was told to speak to him again and im press on him the necessity for some adequate settlement of the question. The interview which had lasted about half an hour and was entirely free and informal then closed and the Sultan withdrew after repeatedly thanking His Excellency for the great honour that he had conferred on him in coming to Maskat and investing him with the G. C. I. E. He assured His Excellency that he and his son were entirely at his orders, as was his whole State, and that he hoped again to meet His Excell ency. The Sultan's bearing throughout the visit and at the interview was dignified, courteous and most friendly, and his pleasure at the receipt of the Gr. C. I. E. was very marked. He wished to come out himself in a boat at His Excellency^ departure but was told that this was unnecessary. It may be here mentioned that there was no hitch or contretemps of any kind throughout the proceedings. At the return visit at ^ he Barza^ Sayad Muhammad the Sultan's brother stood up and sta-ted that he wished to have a private interview to make a representation. He was easily quieted and i was understood that he wanted to 'ay something aoout a remark which His Excellency had made to the Sultan with reference to Sayad* Timur T s visit to India and his wearing the^elhi gold medal.

The Viceroy instructed Major Cox to inform Muhammad if the question were raised again that he had not come v to Maskat to discuss any such matter as 4mis.the future success ion and that if Muhammad had 'been passed over once, when his younger 'brother Peisal had 'been made Sultan, it was probably 'because he deserved it; and the same thing would doubtless happen again.

Regarding an interview which took place between the Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieut~Colcnel Kemhall), the Political Agent at Muscat (Major P. Z. Cox) ancL Seyyid Mahomed bin Turhi, elder brother of the Sultan of Muscat r on 19th November 1903 m On 18th November His Excellency the Viceroy- Lord Curzon~ arrived at Muscat and having received the visit of the Sultan in the morning returned it in the afternoon at His Highness f s residence * During the course oj the interview at which aoout 70 Durbaris were pre sent f Seyyid MahomBd bin Turhi brother of the Sultan suddenly rose from his seat ^ towards the close of the visit, and exclaimed heatedly that he urgently wished for a personal interview with His Excellency the Viceroy at any time or place appointed, either at the British Consulate or on board the 'Hardinge* a:id that ne wished his brother the Sultan to be confronted with him there.00068 there. He was pacified by the Political Agent who was in terpreting and told that anything he had to say he could speak to the Resident later and that his present interrup tion was out of place. He then sat down and the formali ties of the visit were concluded. The reason for his strance action no doubt was that His Excellency the Viceroy, in actznowledgmg the Sultan's welccme and expression of senti ments of loyal attacnment to Great Britain, jruade the natura ooscTvat ion that he hoped that His Highness would give his son Seyyid Taimoor (whom His Excellency had entertained at the Delhi Durbar) a training which would fit him for follow-uw in his father's footsteps. Seyyid Mohammed evidently took this observation as ignoring his own claims to the succes sion. His Excellency directed the Resident to interview Seyyid Mahommed and to ascertain from him what was his ob ject in seeking an interview with him* Seyyid Mahormed was accordingly invited, if he so desired f to meet the Resident and Political Agent at the Consulate at 8 a.m. next morning, 19th November, and this he did, be ingbeing received with the usual compliments. He at first pre - tended that he had come to protest at not having been ac** corded n i s proper salute from His Majesty * s ships when re™ turning the preceding day from the 'Mi zaJ-Purs i» visit to the 'Hardinge n ; he claimed that his proper salute was 17 guns and that he had only been accorded 13. He continued that he considered that he should have had 21 guns, as re presenting the Sultan, but in any case not less than 17 m It was explained to him that it was altogether contrary to our Naval usages to have fired any salute at all for a de putation or official of the Sultan during His Highness 9 s presence in Muscat and that it had only been at the very special request of the Sultan strongly supported by th@ Resident that a salute had been fired at all* The salute that had been fired was that which the Sultan had official — ly intimated to the Political Agent as being the proper one m The Resident expressed the opinion that Seyyid MahoiwriccL ought to feel very much compliWBnted at rece iving 13 guns instead of feeling aggrieved and that it seemBd useless to pursue the topic as we could not admit that Seyyid Mahommed had the slightest grounds for complaint, on the contrary0007.0 contrary. Colonel Kemball added that he considered Seyyid Mahommed 's hasty action during the Viceroy' s visit of the day before to have been in the worst possible taste. Seyyid/ Mahommed then went on to broach what was no doubt the real object of his visit. He said he wanted to know excatly where he stood as regards the future succession to the Sultanate as it seemed to him that his claims were being ignored and that his brother the Sultan was constantly putting Seyyid Taimoor forward in a way which gave him cause to feel uneasy about himself % He claimed that Colonel Ross had clearly promised his father Seyyid Turki on his deathbed that the British Govern ment would always stand by his sons and now why should he be lejt out in the cold and his claims ignored ?If any thing happened to the Sultan he claimed the prior right to the succession. He was informed in reply that according to the experience of the Political Agent the Sultan showed himself always most anxious that Seyyid Mahommsd should be treated with all possible distinction that his position entitled him to, and, as he had mentioned Delhi as an in~ stanceijistdTicQ, it was pozjited out that it was pur&amp;ly his own faulu that he nad not gone to the Durbar. The GrOvemrnBTit of India would have oeen ready to welcome both him and Seyyia Taimoor but he, Seyyid Mahonuned, had refused to go if Seyyid Taimoor went. As to the succession he was re~ minded that Seyyid Feisal was still quite a young man and that as far as human foresight could prophesy i no question of succession was likely to arise for many years to come± hut that as a matter of fact seeing that at the time of his father's death he (Seyyid Mahomned) had not succeeded in obtaining the Sultanate [ had in fact effaced himself al~ together? it was not a little surprising to hear him put forward such claims now, which in any case he could hardly expect to be considered seriously seeing that there was no reason to do so m After some further repitition and ar gument on his part he took his departure and was escorted down stairs by the Political Agent. On the way down he said to Major Cox:' I ask your canaid 'advice* Is it any good my pressing this matter further o - 'am I to sit down under it and be quiet ?' Major Cox repli If00072 'If you take my advice you will certainly drop the matter 'for you can get no possible good by pressing it'. He rejoined 'Very well I will do so, but I beg you to say 'nothing to my brother as to the reason for which I came 'here, as it will only make further mischief: tell him I came about the salute question', Major Cox replied that he did not suppose that His Highness would make any en quiries but that in any case Seyyid Mahomed might be sure that he-Ma J or Cox- would not make any mischief * By that time Seyyid Mahommed had reached the door and bade the Political Agent goodbye* (Sd) C.

SIR, In contiuation of my No;182 of 26th April last I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of M.Delcasse's reply to the Sultan's request regarding M.Goguyer, which came by last mail. 2. It will be seen that Goguyer is therein described as being the representative in Muscat of some persons of importance; &amp; that the French Government do not consider that they have sufficient reasons to order his expulsion as he has conunitted no acts of violence, &amp; is carrying on his business in an honourable manner. These statements throw some light upon M.Laronce's position in regard to this matter as explained by him to my predecessor &amp; reported by the latter in para 3 of his No;453 dated 11th October 1902. Just prior to the arrival of the reply from M.Delcasse I had some interesting conversations with my Colleague on this subject &amp; he repeatedly told me that he would like nothing better than to agitate himself for Goguyer s removalremoval but, that, the latter's supporters were, although fewer &amp; less influential than formerly, still t,oo powerful for him to dare to move in that direction, le assured me however that were representations made by us at the present time, they would indoubtedly be well received, as the French Government know well enough now that Goguyer's presence in Muscat does them more harm than good. Two days after this conversation the reply arrived. M. Laronce says that it is much as he expected it would be, but I think he is a little disappointed at the failure of what was to a great extent his own scheme. 4e is of opinion that the measures proposed will be sufficient to keep Goguyer quiet as regards his writings against the Sultan &amp; Oman Government, but is grieved to find that his countryman's supporters are still possessed of so much influence with the Foreign Minister. K. Mr Russell in Ms No:2566 S.A. dated 27t,h October last, mentioned that Lord Lansdowne intended shortly to ascertain from the French Ambassador whether the French Government would not be willing to agree to his removal, &amp; since then I have heard nothing further. In view therefore of the possibility that Lord Lansdowne has not yet had an opportunity of discuss ing the matter with the French Ambassador; &amp; taking into consideration the fact that M.Laronce still thinks that representations from us would meet with success. I beg re.pect- fully zosuggest that the Secretary of State be again approached on the subject. The reasons for desiring M.Qoguyer's removal from Oman are too well known to need anv ^ need any further allusion hera. I have &amp;tc., Signed W. G. GRSY, Captain I.

From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian T0-S - \ r F eig A n D^Senu 1 ®-' t0 the Go v'nment of India in the In accordance with Foreign Department letter No. 2S43-E..A., dated the 10th August .904, 1 have the honour to submit my views on the subject of a ds to navigation in the Persian Gulf. J I have to express regret that for the reason explained in my letter No 6, of the 4th February 1905, 1 have not been in a position to do so before. ' 2. The Government of India were of opinion, and on general 'rounds it is not open to doubt, that a lighthouse at or near Ras Mussandam is of more importance than the provision of a light at Maskat. I, therefore, refer to this question_ first. The point for consideration- as regards Mussandam is the precise sue on which the light should be placed. In this connection I have recently consulted confidentially the commanders of several ships and have personally examined the locality. Some suggest the north-east point of Mussandam Island, but the majority are. in favour of the Great Quoin, and bearing in mind that the important object to achieve is that the light should be equally useful to ships coming from the north as well as from the south, and that this would be best met by the Great Quoin, which in other respects appears to be inappreciably less convenient than Mussandam, I would recommend that the Great Quoin be selected as the site for any lighthouse which may be oro- jected for this locality. 3. Next in importance to the above, the provision of a similar light at Maskat or on one of the islands of Tamb, Farur or Kais, claims consideration. From the point of view of navigation simply, i should be inclined to give priority of claim to the island light, but from a combined political and nautical standpoint, I am of opinion that Maskat is the more important. For the latter place, it is recommended that a fixed white light or 20' flash light be placed on Maskat island, at or near the place where the British India Steam Navigation Company's flagstaff now is, and that there should also be two leading lights, so placed as to enable ships to reach their anchorage in har bour at any and all hours. 4 The additional lights would be similar in construc tion to the ordinary ship's side-lights, shielded where necessary. 4. In considering the question of a light on Tamb, Farur or Kais, it is to be noted that this would be chiefly for the convenience of ships coming down the Gulf, as the Mussandam light would enable up-going ships to verify their course with regard to the islands ahead. Coming down the Gulf from Bushire, there is nothing to guide a ship after nightfall, and it is little short of phenomenal and a standing credit to British navigation, that so many fast ships habitually traverse this course without mishap. The three sites mentioned as suitable are, the north end of Tamb, the north end of Farur, or the south centre of Kais. The fact that these are variously recommended by equally expert men would seem to indicate that there is not much to choose between them, but, for the purposes of the accelerated mail service, and presuming that there be a light at Mussandam, I am advised that Kais would certainly be the best site. These lights should one and all be of such a strength and nature as to be readily recognisable for what they are on being sighted by navigators. For this purpose, experts have informed me that a light visible at 20 miles distance would be desirable, preferably a flash light. 5. The above are the three most important requisites clearly recognised by all navigators as being essential to facilitate the navigation of Gulf waters. In conclusion, I may mention that lights wonld be welcomed at the follow ing other ports of call and in the positions as stated :— (1) Bahrein islands ... ... at the north end of Muharrag island.

It will be of interest to note that the doings and position of M, Goguyer in Muscat have been explained to him by M, Laronce in accordance with a promise previously made by the latter to me, and I do not anticipate a reappearance of Goguyer*s influence at the French Consulate and the trouble ensuing, therefrom.

For this I believe the Dragoman Abd-ul-Aziz to have been primarily responsible, he having probably represented to Monsieur Laronce that he should receive the same Salute as that accorded to H. B.

Muscat, 22nd Noveinoer 1904. Sir, I have the honour to observe that the Sultan's Wazir, Mahomed Din Azzan, besides being very old suffers from an incurable malady and may reasonably be expected to die at any time, perhaps suddenly, and that in my opinion it would be well to select a candidate for the succession at an early date, so as to have his name ready for suomission to Bis 'lighness. It is true that the Office is at present practically a sinecure but it would be well to be prepared for eventualities however remote. I beg to recommend that Mahomed bin Saeed the late Wazir' s son be selected as our nominee. He is not clever as you know, but may be relied ujon to consult 'iis Majesty's representative in all important patters, and is undoubtedly the best man available at present from our point of view.No /73~ of 2904 # nfll^ y British Residency and Consulate-General, Bush ire, ^ ^ Decembe r 1904 9 To The Political Agent and His lajesty's Consul, ff uscat, Vir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of yo^r letter Ko 061 dated 22nd November 1904 on the subject of Seyyid fuhomed bin Saeed as a possible successor to Seyyid Uahoimd bin Azzan. 2 % I quite endorse the good opinion which you have formed of the fomer but the Sultan is within limits at liberty to choose his cum *Vazier n and I fear he would he unline~ ly if the post fell vacant in the near future to choose Ifahormd bin Faeed as he has never liked either him or his fatherand in 1 dhomed 's case would be able to say with so 'B reason that his tender years and experience ixxrdly gave him the influence at present fi cial of the St a te . 3, I think it will be really to our interest if the life of the present dotard incumbent is spared for so ie ti to, to come , feanwhilQ, the excQlIent service which Sey/id Mahomd bin Xaeed has Just rendered to ourselves and the Sultaii in connection ivith the H -aron Inner dale ' incident gives you an excellent opportunity for publicly patronis ing him and quietly pushing his interests aizd insinuating him where possible as a go-between between yourselj and His Highness , You might also find an opportunity Oj informally re~ cownending the Sultan to increase his allowances in view of his recent services 9 4.

My Lord:- I have the lionour to rec^ueEt the f:..vour of Your Lordship's instructions in the following matter. A few months ago two Indians presented them selves at the Vice Consulate of Adana and applied to 'be register ed as British subjects. They were respectable men with farms and had been several years in the country. They had no documents of any kind to shew their nationality and had taken no steps in the matter before. Captain Townshend therefore declined to re commend them to me for registration unless they produced proof. They then left Adana and three months later returned bringing documents of which I have the honour to forward copies herewith. Prom these Your Lordship will see that they are Indians from Muscat, but although they hold certificates of registration frcm H.M.Political Agent at that pl ^ce, I am in doubt v/hether Your Lordship would consider them entitled to the permanent protection of this Consulate.

The Baluch Shadad bin Nasaf came to Maskat from Syria in November last, and after explaining his circumstances to me desired to be registered as a British subject. He was unable to prove to my satisfaction that he had a right to be considered as such, little or no evidence beyond his own statements were forthcoming, and as he had undoubtedly been born in Matrah I did not consider myself justified in assuming him to be other than a subject of the Sultan of Maskat. I therefore dismissed his application. Two days later Shadad was sent to me by His Highness with a request that I would give him a certificate which would entitle him to protection equal to that enjoyed by our own subjects. I replied that I would not do this without instructions and offered to refer the case to the Government of India. After further discussion with His Highness during which I was informed that the man had made all arrangements to leave on the following day, I agreed in the cir cumstances to register him as a &lt;c British protected person ' noting specifically on the certificate, in order to avoid possible future difficulites, that such action had only been taken at His Highness the Sultan's request. The latter express ed his gratitude and satisfaction. Case (II). The document granted in this case is a non-committal one it amounts only to a request for such good offices as His Majesty's Consul might feel able to give. 3. As similar requests for British protection as that recorded in connection with case (1) will probably be made by His Highness the Sultan in future, I take this opportunity of soliciting instructions as to what action should be taken thereon in case I have over-estimated the amount of protection which it is con sidered desirable to afford to Maskat subjects, 4. The remarks contained in paragraph 2 of Foreign Office Circular, dated 3rd July 1893 (Treaty,) dealing with spheres of influence would appear to be of interest in this connection. G- C.

T he R ight H on'ble S t . JOHN BRODRICK, Bis Majesty's Secretary of State for India, S imla, the Uth September 1905, S ir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret despatch No. 13 of 5th May 1905, relative to an application made to His Majesty's Consul at Aleppo by two supposed natives of Maskat for registration. 2. In reply, we transmit copies of correspondence with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and with the Political Agent at Maskat, which explain the circumstances in which the documents referred to were granted. The document issued hy His Majesty's Consul in regard to Hai Mahmed-bin-Ahmed was merely a recommendation for good offices, and expressly says that he is an Omani subject. Major Grey's action therefore in this case does not seem to call for any remarks. As regards Shadad-bin-Nusaf, there seems no doubt that Major Grey's action was irregular, in view of the fact that that individual, being a subject of the Sultan of Maskat, clearly failed to satisfy the conditions necessary to entitle him to be certified as a British-protected person. 3. In answer to Major Grey's request for instructions, we propose to inform him through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (1) that he should on no account give a certificate of registration to any person who cannot prove British nationality or the status of a subject to a Ruler under British protection, his conduct in cases of the latter kind to be regulated by the principles laid down in your despatches Nos. 55 (Political) of 23rd June 1905 and 67 (Political) of 30th June 1905; (2) that such personal requests as Major Grey refers to as being made by the Sultan {e.g., in the case of Shadad-bin-Nusaf) should be met by the grant of letters of recommend ation, due care being taken to grant even these with discrimination and for thoroughly good reasons only. In order that there may be no mistake as to their purport and intention, the letters of recommendation should be issued in such a form as cannot be mistaken for a certificate of any sort, ^preferably in the form of a letter addressed to one or more of His Majesty s Consular officers.4. 'We also propose to inform Major Cox that the instructions contained in Foreign Office Circular (Treaty) of 3rd July as to natives of spheres of influence do not apply to subjects of the Sultan of Oman who enjoys the status of an independent ruler.

Referring to Lieutenant Shakespear's Memorandum of 10th November 1906, it seems evident from the terms of paragraph 6 thereof that the latter quite realised that he was not in a position to judge of the value of the reports which he had heard ; at the same time I think it is probable that he might wish to qualify Major Grey's declaration as to the source from which his information was derived as he well knew that Ali Hussein-bin-Nasir was an inveterate gossip. Lieutenant Shakespear, however, is now in England, and in view of the satisfactory conclusion in regard to Seyyid Taimoor at which Major Grey has anived, it does not seem to me that a reference to him on the point would serve any useful purpose. Demi-official, dated the 3cth November 1906. F lom __MAJOR P. Z. COX, CLE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— major W. G. Grey, Political Agent and Kis Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. I enclose a Memorandum recorded by Shakespear on the subject of Seyyid Taimoor and his friends, which he brought away from Maskat. It was his intention to finish it and to make copies for you and me on board, but among other distractions he had not time to make the copies and left it here as it is on departure with Somers Cocks. I send you the original for record and shall be glad if you will let me have your views on the subject at leisure. 1 daresay Shakespear has received exaggerated reports, but anyone whom I meet from Maskat now-a-days comments on Talmoor's attitude towards his fatner, and 1 is a matter which we obviously need to watch closely, both in the Sultan s interests and our own. Who is the Mulla from whom the boys are receiving secular or religious instruction ? 1 was told the other day but 1 forget. * No. 213 (Confidential), dated Maskat, the 27th April IQ 0 ?* Frot n major W.

In a Memorandum attached to y 0OT ^ ,905. to the address 0 f rt ; el .G^^ t nc ^ In o t g^W^aimoo^ eldest son ofr While my enquiries and investigations were in progress the murder of the Wali Sulaiman occurred, and I thought it better to wait until the elucidation of f the circumstances attending that event had been completed, and^ the negocia- tions following it had reached some conclusion, before complying with your request. 2. Turning first to your Memorandum of 1905, I may say that Seyyid Taimoor abandoned the idea of the pilgrimage of his own accord, and that the sword to which you refer was recovered by him with his father's knowledge and approval. His correspondence with the Mutawwas is genercdly, though not always, read by the Sultan ; and I have myself seen letters from them in connec tion with the negociations referred to in paragraph (1), which contained hypo- critical expressions of wonder and regret that His Highness himself could not be brought to believe in their profession of good-will, but nothing could lead one to* suppose that a secret understanding inimical to His Highness exists between the writers and the person addressed. Up to the time of my departure from Maskatinjuly last all that could be said was that Seyyid Taimoor was in clined to blame his father for want of friendship and lack of sympathy with the Mutawwa religious tenets ; there was no question of ill-feeling between them then, neither is there at present. 3. The information upon which Lieutenant Shakespear's Memorandum is based was obtained from Ali Husain bin Nasir, the most inveterate mischief- maker in Maskat, upon whose statements no reliance can be placed. When first asked by me he denied being the author, and it was not until I came to him with overwhelming proofs that he confessed. I append a copy of this Memo randum with comments. 4. Shortly before my return from leave. Sheikh Muhammad bin Sheikhan As-Salimi, a Mutawwa priest, arrived in Maskat from the Sharqiyah and took up the post of tutor in religious law, etc., to Taimoor and his brother Nadir. Upon arrival I pointed out to His Highness the dangers which seemed to be involved in this new departure, but he made light of them saying that he was merely humouring his sons and the Mutawwas at the same time, and that perfect con fidence exists between the former and himself. Although the Sheikh, who is at present with Seyyid Nadir in the Samayil valley, has not done much harm hither to, it would probably be safer for His Highness to dismiss him ; but I doubt whether he will feel inclined to do that, even in the light of recent Mutawwa perfidy, 5. I quite agree that this matter requires close attention, and such it will continue to receive from me. At the present time the relations between Taimoor and his father are quite satisfactory, and I do not think there is the slightest cause for anxiety. Mr. Shakespear's Memorandum. ft Nearly a year ago Major Cox noted upon the ultra-religious tendencies of Seyyid Taimoor bin Feisal as being hardly serious enough to need any special notice. At this date therefore it may be use ful to place on record that Seyyid Tai moor so far from having given up the mode of life which led to the previous rumours continues to furnish matter for remark and gossip in his attitude to his father and to foreigners. Comments thereupon. This Is grossly exaggerated. Sfeyyld Taimoor has renounced the white or Mutawwa turban for an ordinary one, and has resumed smoking which is contrary to the Mutawwa doctrines. His attitude to foreigners leaves little to be desired, and he is on excel lent terms with his father.3 00 Mr. Shakespear's Memorandum. Comments thereupon. His particular friends and advisers are:— (1) Mahommed bin Sa'id Al-Kundi who was his tutor in his youn gest days and with whom he still maintains the closest inti macy. This man is reported to be one of the few rabidly fanatical people in Maskat, as he apparently preaches a kind of ' Oman for Omanis ' doctrine into which of course Islam as a religious argument against the Christian ' Kafir ' is no doubt very largely imported. He is said to have immense influence with Seyyid Taimoor. (2) Sheikh Msa of Sharqiyah, a man who has already been mentioned in the Memorandum above refer red to. He is said to have great influence with Seyyid Tai- moor and to keep up a corres pondence with him of an ex tremely intriguing, if not treason able, character. He advocates the same doctrine as the Mullah above noted and adds more force to it by suggesting that, as Seyyid Feisal has betrayed his country into the hands of foreigners and is himself so bound by his debts, subsidv, etc, f to them, it behoves all true Arabs to rise and depose so weak a ruier and substitute a more capab .e man, Se\* yid Taimoor is to be the 'chosen one, and I am informed that this suggestion has already been broached to Sevyed Taimoor, There is even a stor\ ^ (froin a not very trustworthy source) that Seyvid Feisal, having heard of the treasonable correspondence between his son and the Sheikh of Sharqiyah ac.uai- ly intercepted one of the lat .er s letters to Seyyid Taimcor. Seyyid Feisal is reported to have then convened a private meeting of his son and brother and to have discussed the gravity of tne situa tion and then to have added that it would have to be a choice between Seyyid Taimoor's life and his own. This is supposed to have taken place about two months ago, but be yond threatening the Sheikh of Shar qiyah with punishment His Highness has done nothing. This is exaggerated though undoubt edly this man is inclined to be a fanatic. His influence is not very great in Maskat, and that with Seyyid Taimoor is decreasing, as the latter is rapidly ceasing to be a child and is beginning to have ideas of his own. This man is too well known to need any description. His object in corres ponding with Se5 T yid Taimoor and the result that correspondence has had hitherto have already been stated by me. His object generally is to contrive the transfer of Government from the ruling branch of the family to another. This is denied by everybody I have questioned, and it is extremely unlikely to be true. The Sultan savs that this story is nonsense. Seyyid Feisal would not be so foolish as to threaten the ' Sheikh of Sharqiyah ' with punishment which he knew he was not able to inflict. The story is utterly denied by everybody I asked.&lt; Mr. Shakespear's Memorandtim. Comments thereupon. IS (3) Aii bin Salim, Seyyid, who^ Taimoor's father-in-law and according to popular rumour not particularly well inclined to the present Sultan Seyyid Feisal. (4) Abdul-Aziz Ar-Ruwahi, the drago man of the French Consulate. (5) Abdullah bin Suleiman, onp of tbe Sultan's clerks, and (6) Ahmad bin Bidar bin Saif. All the above are said to have serious ly discussed the disposal of Seyyid Feisal and the possibility even of his murder, after which Seyyid Taimoor would be Sultan and will take measures to make things unpleasant for foreign ers. There is not much of the Pan-Islam- ism movement in this but rather an agi tation and intrigue in my opinion, by Seyyid Taimoor distinctly ultra-reli gious (as compared to his father) atti tude and the weakness of Seyyid Feisal. Unfortunately I cannot judge of the value of the information received owing to my short acquaintance with Maskat, but I imagine that Majors Cox and Grey will be able to value the influence of the persons named at its relative value. Seyyid Yusuf, one of the Sultan's most intimate advisers and a better educated man than most of His Hicrh. ness's subjects, does not, as far as I can ascertain, support this agitation though he may take what little part is possible in Pan-Islamism in Maskat. He is in telligent enough whilst deploring the This man is rather an obstructionist, but has no connection with the Mutaw- was. He does not approve of too much intimacy between Taimoor and them. At the same time he is very anti-Eng lish* still although I have made some Sa *J^ is the, progress with him lately. He is inclin* to vIsiThis ed to run in couples with Abdul-Aziz years agouti Ar-Ruwahi. commendation. P, Z.( The remarks made in regard of Ali bin Salim apply to this man, except' that his being attached to the French Consulate makes it impossible for me to be friendly with him. See the last paragraph of the enclosure to my letter No. 184, dated 15th April 1907. This person seems to have been dragged into this because he is a friend of Ali bin Salim's and also of Taimoor. He seems quite harmless* Son of the War Minister, and known as Seyyid Taimoor's ' VVazier.' A foolish headstrong youth who will no doubt grow out of his follies as Tai moor himself is doing. That any such discussion as this has taken place I hold to be in the highest degree improbable. To begin with some of the parties have never met Sheikh 'Isa, and none of them have seen him for years. ' No remarks are necessary here, as my views on Pan-Islamism here are already known.Mr. Shakespear's Memorandum. Sultan's weakness to see that Seyyid Taimoor with his ultra-religious ways would be a failure here, where interfer ence with British interests would not be tolerated for a moment. There has been considerable gossip of relations between father and son be ing strained and as a case in point the following story is illustrative Early in November Sheikh Ali bin Saleh (brother of the Sheikh of Shar- qiyah) came to Ruwi and desired to call on the Sultan. He was accompanied by the Wali Sulaiman bin Suwailim, His Highness apparently apprehensive of a possible repetition of what occurred in 1895 was exceedingly annoyed and had high words with Seyyid Taimoor who took the Sheikh's part. It is reported that the Sultan has seldom shown so heated a spirit. The incident closed with a present to Sheikh Ali and a request that he would at once leave Ruwi for his home. Comments thereupon. (Sd.) W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Lt., (late) Officiating Political Agent, Ma skat. This story is absurdly exaggerated. Why should the Sultan show a heated spirit? It rested with him to say whether the Sheikh should come or not, and he, probably wisely, declined to receive him. Taimoor tried to per suade his father to allow the interview, but the latter was firm. Taimoor was disappointed, but I am told by everyone that he was little more. The usual gift, and a polite intima tion that he could come to Maskat. N.B. —As already reported by me the Sultan has recently refused to allow Seyyid Taimoor to proceed to Samayil to interview Sheikh 'Isa in connection with the murder of the Wali Sulaiman. Taimoor has shown no disappointment at this, and his relations with his father and myself were never more cordial than they are at the time of writing although he knows as well as I do who it was who really prevented him from going.

These include: debts of and loans to the Sultan of Muscat by the British Government and various individuals (f 44); a report from Cox (October 1903) of Sultan Faisal bin Turki's desire to abdicate (ff 54-56); numerous memorandums of interviews taking place in November 1903 between the Sultan, Political Resident (Charles Kemball), Muscat Agent (Cox) and the Viceroy of India (Lord Curzon) (ff 59-62, 64-67 68-73). During one interview the Sultan is bestowed the honour of Knight Grand Commander of the Indian Empire (G.C.I.E.)
