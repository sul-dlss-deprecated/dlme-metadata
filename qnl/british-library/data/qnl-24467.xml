GENERAL REPORT FOR 1879-80. The classification of the various territories to be noticed is arranged as follows:— 1. The ^Oman or Muskat State. Pirate Coast. El-Bahrain. Nejdj El-Hasa^ and El-Katr. Southern Persia. Bassidore. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 1.—'Oman. The Officiating' Political Agent's report forms Part IV. It is to be noted that for convenience of political administration the Government of India decided that the political jurisdiction of the Agent at Muskat should extend to Ras^ Sajir or Sair so as to include the district of Dhofar. 2.— Pirate Coast. The trucial ports or townships on this coast continue under the government of the same Chiefs^ namely :— 1. Ras-el-Khaimah, under Hameyd-bin- - 'Abdullah^ Jowdsimee. 2. Umm-el-Kawain, under Ahmed-bin-'Abdullah, Al-bil-'Ali. 3. 'Ajman^ under Rashid-bin-Hameyd^ Al-bu-'Ali. 4. Shargah^ under Salim-bin-Sultan^ Jowasimee. 5. Dabay, under Hashar-bin-Maktoom, Al-bu-Falasah. 6. Abu-Zhabbee, under Za'eed-bin-Khaleefah, Beni-Yas. During the year tranquillity was maintained on the sea along this coast, and the various Chiefs have continued to observe the general truce which was reported last year on the land. A collision was feared about November between the people of Shargah on the one side and those of Ras- el-Khaimah, ^Ajman and Umm-el-Kawain on the other. Disturbances had occurred amongst the Noeym tribe near Bereymee, and the Shargah and 'Ajman Shaikhs espoused opposite causes, and afforded active sup port to their respective friends. The three Shaikhs of ■'Ajman, Ras-el- Khaimah and Umm-el-Kawain on this occasion formed an offensive and defensive alliance, but no actual hostilities were reported. The Shaikh of 'AJman proceeded himself to Bereymee. On this the Chief of Shar gah concluded a fresh treaty of alliance with the Chief of Abu-Zhabbee. fhe faction of the Noeym favored by 'Ajman appears to have had the best of the dispute and the ^Ajman Shaikh returned home on 6th De cember. i I: || Hi-H vi J4 administration report of the persian gulf political In July a mutual agreement was signed by all the trueial Chiefs of the Pirate Coast regarding the surrender of fraudulent absconders, or a nnpmiiv r payment of their liabilities. The text of this agreement will be found in the Appendix. The coast was very unhealthy during the year, and there was great mortality from small-pox and fever of a malarious type. At Shargah alone it was reported that 2,500 persons had died. With reference to the proceedings summarized in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Annual Report for 1877-78, it has now to be noted that the Al-Kobeysat branch of the Beni-Yas, formerly residing at ^Odeyd, have of their own accord returned with Shaikh Batye-bin-Khadim to Abu-Zhabbee and resumed allegiance to Shaikh 'Za^eed-bin-Khaleefah, who has restored to them the property they held previous to their seces sion. 3.— Bahrain. The measures adopted by, and at the instance of, the Government of India for the suppression of piracy in the waters between Bahrain and El-Kateef and round the coast of El-Katr have been so far effec tive that only one case of the kind has occurred during the year. The particulars are as follows :— In July a fishing vessel lying at anchor off Luffan on the east coast of El-Katr was boarded by a band of the Beni-Hajir under the now notorious robber, Za'eed-bin-Mohammed, and his brother, Sn'ood-bin- Mohammed. The Beni-Hajir had got possession of two vessels belong ing to the El-Mohandah tribe of Khor Shajeej, who were suspected of connivance in the matter. The property plundered was estimated at Krans 3,026. Inquiry was instituted into the conduct of the people of Khor Shajeej, and as it appeared they acted under compulsion, it was not considered necessary to punish them. Letters of warning were however addressed to the Shaikh of Khor Shajeej and the other Katr Chiefs, to the effect that it was their duty to guard against their boats being used for piratical purposes, and that they would be liable to be called to account for such occurrences. The Hajiree leader, Za^eed-bin-Mohammed, is still at large, not withstanding the reiterated demands of the Political Officers in Turkish Arabia for his arrest. It is of course indispensable, in view to the permanent security of the seas, that he should be captured and punished. In paragraph 18 of the report for the previous year, an account was given of the proceedings of one 'Ali-bin-Jabir, a Bahrain robber, and his arrest by the Turkish authorities of El-Hasa. Through the media tion of the Political Officers in Turkish Arabia, the request of the Chief of Bahrain for the extradition of this culprit and his companions was complied with, under orders of the Wali of Busrah, and ^Ali-bin-Jabir was executed at Bahrain by Shaikh ^Eesa-bin-Ali. A Nakhoda, named 'Abdullah, who had been convicted of lending his vessel to the Heni-Hajir pirates, was arrested by the Chief ol; Bahrain, and was killed in a struggle with his guards.uesidenct and muskat political agency for 1879-80. In October, Shaikh K gso ., Clucf of Bahraiiij proceeded on th© pilgrim- a ge to Mecca and returned in Januaiy. In February, 'Ali-bin-Nasir, one of the persons arrested and taken to India in 1869, was released from Aden and proceeded to Busrah and the Nejd Coast. Several families of the Dawawadah tribe removed in 1879 from El -Kateef to Bahrain, and about 300 of the Na 'eem tribe formerly residing at Zobarah also settled on the islands. On the whole the year as regards Bahrain may be said to have passed satisfactorily. 4.— Nejd, El-Hasd, El-Katr. Nejd. —Accordino' to trustworthy reports received during the past autumn from the interior of Nejd, 'Abdullah-bin-Feysal, who has conti nued to reside at Riadh, has succeeded in greatly improving his position. The two elder sons of Su'ood-bin-Feysal have been residing at Biadh and have become adherents to his cause. 'Abdullah has kept up a friendly correspondence with Sa'eed Pasha, Governor of El-Hasa, and has come to a friendly understanding with Ibn-RasMd, the powerful Chief of Jebel -Shamar, and other Nejdean Shaikhs, and presents have been (exchanged. Some younger sons of Su'ood are said to be ready to revive the family feud, if they can obtain sufficient support. It seems the impression in the best informed quarters that 'Abdullah-bin-FeysaVs star is in the ascendant, and that he will probably ere long establish his authority more securely and widely. More importance and interest may again attach to Nejd than of late years. El-Hasd. —Sa'eed Pasha, whose nomination to be Mutaserrif or Governor of El-Hasa was mentioned in the previous report, had earned the good-will of the inhabitants and a reputation as a good administrator. He was, however, the nominee of Abdullah Pasha, lately removed from the Government of Busrah, and shared the fall of his patron. The successor was Sa'eed Heg, who took charge for the second time in autumn. Sa'eed Pasha directed an expedition against Jabeyl, a fort belonging to the Ameyer tribe who had been implicated in plundering and piracies about Kateef. The fort was sacked, and eventually the Ameyer submitted to Sa'eed Pasha and gave hostages for future good behaviour. The Beni- Hajir seem to have defied his authority, and a respectable merchant of El-Hasa was waylaid and murdered by Za'eed-bin-Mohammed. Sa'eed Pasha visited El-Bida'a on the Katr coast in the Turkish gun boat Zsiw/r/ma in May, and had interview's with Jasim-bin-Mohammed- bin-Thani, Nasir-bin-Mobarik, and other notables. El-Katr. —With exception of the case of piracy referred to under Bahrain, the Katr Coast has been unmolested. It was reported in October that Za'eed-bin-Mohammed Hajiree was prowling about the neighbour hood of 'Odeyd in search of a boat to put out to sea with a view to plunder, and that the Shaikh of Wakrah had embarked to intercept the robbers; but no mischief resulted in this case. In November a section of the Al-bu-Kuwarah, under Mohammed-bin- Sa'eed, dismantled their habitations at El-Bida'a and removed to Foweyrat further north on the Katr Coast. The move seems to have resulted from a quarrel between Mohammed-bin-Sa'eed and Jasim-bin-Mohammed- Thani. A good understanding exists between the Al-bu-Kuwarah and i. ill' 1 1; ilM i l/llit' »6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL the Chief of Bahrain^ and frequent communications passed. A Turkish Government steamer soon after visited Poweyrat to enqire into the cause of the migration. The political status of the Katr Coast generally remains somewhat undefined. El-Bida'a is recognized as a Turkish possession^ and the Governor of El-Hasa on the occasion of his visit appointed Jasim-bin Mohammed-Thani to be Wali of the township. Shaikh Batye-bin-Khadim with his followers of the Kobeysat Beni- Yas, who had fled from 'Odeyd to El-Bida'a, were invited to return to Abu-Zhabbee by the Chief in January, and desired to do so. Shaikh Jasim whilst not openly objecting put obstacles in the way ; and the Kobeysat decamped secretly and. returned to Abu-Zhabbee. 5.— Southern Persia. Arabisian. —-At the expiry of the Persian official year in March 1880, Prince Hamza Mirza, Hishmat-ed-Doulah, was recalled to the capital, and the Shales eldest son, the Zil-es-Sultan, is now entrusted with the Gov ernment of Arabistan and the provinces previously under the Hishmat- ed-Doulah in addition to Ispahan and its dependencies. Haji Jabir Khan, Nusrut-ul-Moolk, Governor of Mohammerah, still lingers in precarious health. The Felahiyah and other districts continue generally in a state of disquietude. Shaikh Rahmah was, during the year, ejected in favor of Shaikh Faris, but is again in charge of Felahiyah' in a feeble and unpopular manner. It is expected that the death of Haji Jabir Khan which may occur any day, will be the signal for general anarchy in Persian Arabistan, for much of the real control of the various districts centres in the aged Shaikh. Pars. His Royal Highness the Motemid-ed-Doulah has remained Govern or-General of tars, and most of the subordinate Governors have retained their posts. I he roads have been safe, but the autumn and spring rains having again failed, very high prices prevail throughout the province. Some disturbances occurred in the Deelam district, where Khan Ali, who had been superseded by Abdullah Khan as Zabit, was said to be refractory. In Dashtee also some local disturbances broke out in connection with the collection of revenue. Shaikh Mazkoor Khan of Kongoon, who was last year reported in revolt, was superseded in the government by Mohammed Ibrahim Beg. After a good deal of petty warfare. Shaikh Mazkoor shut himself up in the fort of Soorkh, and to conclude the story, was made prisoner in May * He has since been strangled. 1 &lt;S80, and. IS now on his way to Shiraz, where he will probably be put to death.* Relations with the local authorities at Shiraz, Bushire and Bunder Abbass have been friendly and satisfactory. 6.— Bassidore. The usual guard has been kept at Bassidore, which station is still under the supervision of Assistant Surgeon Abder Raheem. That officer has furnished me with a useful and interesting report on the salt caveseesidency and muskat political agency for 1879-80 7 of Kishm and adjoining coast, and the trade in salt from the Persian Coast. As I find no previous official report on the subject recorded, the * Part III, Appendix B. paper will be appended to the trade report* Assistant Surgeon Abder Raheem has during the long period of his service at Bassidore furnished much useful information, and has afforded my predecessor and myself valuable assistance in many ways. I take this opportunity to recommend him to the favorable notice of Government. Establishments. Political—In May ]879, Major E. Mockler, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran Coast, proceeded on sick leave to Europe, and in July Captain E. L.

The ap pointment of Assistant Political Agent, Mekran Coast, has not been filled up, and Mr. B. Ffinch, Deputy Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, has been placed in political charge of the Mekran Coast. Detachments of Marine battalion have been maintained at Jask and Gwadur, and the latter place has been less unhealthy of late.

The Beacon, Vulture and Ready have since been on the station. No vessel of war was in the Gulf during last hot season. Postal. The working of the Persian Government postal establishment has not been so satisfactory of late, and complaints have been heard. The British Post Offices at Bunder Abbass and Lingah have been made sub- offices, and the administration of the Gulf postal system has been trans ferred to the Post-Master-General of Bombay.

Therefore in accordance with this agreement we consent— M—In the event of a runaway seeking refuge in our territories, whether by sea or land, to consider it our duty to at once restore him to the Chief from whose jurisdiction he may have absconded. Ind. —In the event of its being proved that a runaway is protected by any Chief, and not delivered up, or his liability accepted, when de manded by the Government Agent, such Chief shall be liable to a fine of 50 dollars in addition to all just claims proven against such runaway. 3n/.—Further, if the Chief harbouring such runaway, refuse to deliver him up, or accept his liabilities when demanded by the Govern ment Agent, and permit him to proceed to the pearl banks in pursuance of his vocation, such Chief shall be liable to a fine of 100 dollars in addition to all just proven claims against the runaway.

MacIvor, Assistant Political Resident, Persian Gulf. At a time when the question of transport largely engrosses the attention of Government and the Military authorities in ludia^ when the Afghan war has taxed to the utmost the transport resources of India and has proved the inadequacy of the camel as a transport animal under certain conditions, and the necessity of recourse to other means of transport, a few notes upon the breeding, treatment, &amp;c., of the Persian mule in Persia, and upon Persia as a source of supply for mules, may not prove uninteresting. The value of the mule as a transport animal, especially in rough mountainous countries and in countries where made roads, if any, are few and far between, cannot well be overrated. The merits of the mule as a baggage animal, compared with the camel and the pony, are tolerably well known, and may be here briefly enumerated. Compared with the camel, the mule, whilst capable of carrying a load but little inferior in weight to that carried by the camel, possesses the following advantagesEarly maturity, the mule being fit for service at four years of age, the camel not until five; greater speed, the average rate of marching of the mule being three and a half miles an hour, while that of the camel is two and a half; for military pur poses this is a very considerable advantage, as it enables them to keep pace with the troops, and also to accomplish longer marches; surefootedness over ' kotuls' or ' ghauts' and bad ground, the mule marching under a heavy load over the most rocky and roughest tracks almost as well as on a made road, while on sharp rocky roads and on slippery wet soil the camel is almost useless; greater hardihood and a stronger constitution, for though the mule is subject to most of the diseases and ills that affect the horse, yet he is subject in a less degree, while the camel is liable to various peculiar diseases that are not in the least understood by the best veterinary surgeons, and the remedies applied by the most skilful camel- men themselves prove that they are equally ignorant and helpless in effecting a cure, e.g., I have seen a cameFs off-ear slit as an infallible remedy for lameness in the near hind leg! also his neck fired for the same purpose, and other equally incomprehensible remedies. Compared with the horse or pony as a baggage animal, the mule pos sesses greater endurance; is more surefooted ; has much tougher sinews, so that his legs stand more work; is more hardy and stronger in proportion to his size, and has harder hoofs, a matter of no small moment when con tinuous marching has to be performed, and shoeing -smiths are not always procurable. The mule is also steadier and less inclined to fight than the pony. I am unable to say how the Persian mule compares with the mule of other countries, not being sufficiently acquainted with any o lei. But the mule of any other country which excels the Persian in enc mance1G administration report of the persian gulf political and carrying power must be good indeed. In 1877 seventeen mules from Fars were shipped to the Bombay Government for service in the mountain batteries, and the Adjutant-General of the Army the follow ing year writes:— ' The mules sent from Persia last year were of a good stamp and have turned out well/' Districts of Persia where the mule is em,ployed.^—W ules are exten sively employed for carrying purposes throughout the south-western and western parts of Persia. In all the eastern districts, Khorassan, Yezd, Kerman, Seistan, and Persian Mekran, the carriage of the country is almost altogether performed by camels, but in the south-western and western districts, Fars, Behbehan, Isfahan, Arabistan, Khuzistan, Luristan, Koordistan, Kirmanshah, Hamadan, Teheran, and Azerbaijan, mules and donkeys replace the camel to a very large extent, and in some places the mule almost monopolizes the carrying trade. For the rough, stony roads, or rather tracts (for roads there are none), throughout these districts the mule is admirably adapted, and the Persians are by no means blind to his good qualities. By whom bred. —The population of south-western Persia may be divided into two distinct classes: the settled, Dehati or Dehnishiu, dwellers in villages; and the nomad, Eeliyat or Chadrnishin, the dweller in tents. It is by the latter that the mules are bred. A few are bred here and there among tL j villagers, but their number is inconsiderable. It sometimes happens also that some of the brood mares among the Eeliyat herds belong to villagers who pay the Eeliyats for sending them and breeding mules from them. Breeding. —Mules are bred from mares. They say that a very few are bred from the female donkey, but that they are small and inferior in every respect. The method of breeding is as follows :—The mares from which it is intended to breed are placed apart and carefully herded in pastures by themselves. The number of mares in each herd varies, and these mares generally belong to different owners, each man owning from one to ten or more. Several donkey stallions of approved breed and size are associated with each herd. These donkeys are carefully selected for their breed, size, and shape, and are considered very valuable animals, and are well looked after. They are taken from their mothers when quite young, and are placed under someof the mares. Mares which have thrown colts are chosen for this purpose, the colts being brought up by hand, and the young donkeys substituted to the mothers. The reason for choosing mares with colts is that fillies are much more prized among the Persians, and great care is taken of them, while colts are but little esteemed, and it is not considered of much consequence if they come to grief. These donkeys growing up thus along with the mares are accepted by them when of age. It sometimes happens that the number of mares in a herd are more than can be attended to by the regular donkey stallions of the herd, and in this case, when donkeys reared under mares are not procurable, recourse must be had to other donkeys. Large, sound, well-bred donkeys are then chosen, but it is necessary first to excite them by means of a female donkey, and then to withdraw the female donkey and substitute a mure.eesidency and muskat political agency for 1879-80. 17 Bearing and castration. —The young mule is allowed to grow up under its mother and to graze with the herd until three years of age, when it is taken away for sale or to be trained to work. At the age of two years all the males are castrated, the method adopted being to make an incision in the scrotum and tie a string tightly round the spermadic cord, when the mule is set free, and in a day or two the testicle falls off. Training. —When three years old the mule is broken in to work. For the first two journeys no weight is put on his back, and he simply follows in the caravan. On the third journey a load of 80 lbs. is put on him and this is gradually increased until he can carry 320 lbs., which is the 'limit of an ordinary load. Some muleteers make the young mules cany small loads after a few days' training. They bind up their eyes with a cloth, and then place on their back a sack containing 20 lbs. or so of sand and walk them about for a short time. They repeat this process for three or four days, gradually increasing the quantity of sand, and on the fifth day the young mules are ready to carry a regular load, A small load of about 160 lbs. is then put on them, and this is increased until they can carry the full load of 320 lbs. The mule is fully trained in a year's time, and at four years old is tit for service. Feeding. —As long as the young mule is at large no grain is given, but when at three years of age he is made to follow the caravan, 4 lbs. of barley per diem is given him, and this is increased to 6 lbs. when he is lightly loaded, and afterwards to 8 lbs., which is the full allowance for a trained mule. Straw (barley or wheat) is given as much as the mule can eat. A full grown mule eats about 20 lbs. of straw per diem, litis complement, viz., 8 lbs. of barley and 20 lbs. of straw, is given to every full grown mule whether on the march or at the halt. It is said that it less be given 'to them, even when unladen and at a halt they will suftei when next taken out for work. At the halt mules are fed twice a day, morning and evening, straw being supplied between times. On the march mules are fed in the hot weather at about 4 o'clock p.m ., and shortly after they finish their march at about 4 or 5 o'clock a.m . In the cold weather they are fed at abou 6 o'clock p.m . and about 2 o'clock a.m . before they march. Ihe evening feed in every case consists of 6 lbs. of barley mixed with straw, an e morning feed of 2 lbs. barley mixed with straw. Straw is given during the day. During the two or three months when the grass is gieen, no giain is given to the mules. About Shuster and in Koordistan the mu es aie then turned loose to graze and do no work; further east an on e Bushire-Isfahan road the mules continue to work, but on y 0 ^ marches, and at the end of the march are turned out to graze. or instance, the caravans generally march from Bushire to S ni z m rom eight to twelve days, but in the grazing season they take about tinr y days to perform the same distance. Watering. —Mules are watered three times a day in the hot weather and twice in the cold. The times of watering on the maici are m cold weather, about half an hour after the evening and morning teecis,18 administration report of the persian gulf political in the hot weather, half an hour after the evening feed, half an hour before the morning feed, and again about mid-day. Grooming. —On the march mules are groomed once about 4 p.m* each day; when halted generally twice, morning and evening. The ratio of drivers to mules in a caravan is usually one to four, and each driver must attend entirely to the four mules under his charge, grooming, watering, feeding, and, generally, taking care of them. The grooming is performed in a very slovenly manner; the pack-saddle being removed, the mule is simply scraped all over with a rattle-trap kind of curry-comb (kushao), and a rub given with a small hair bag (shal), and the groom ing is complete. The saddle is then replaced on the mule's back not to be removed until grooming time again comes round. Equipment. —The following is the equipment required for each mule in a caravan :— Palan, pack-saddle, that universally used throughout Persia, is a large frame-work made of sacking stuffed with coarse rushes. It is shaped to fit the back, the greater part of which it covers, and comes well forward over the withers. Boonahi and Ashirma. —These correspond to breeching, and pre vent the saddle slipping forward going downhill; the roonaki being a broad leather strap attached to the saddle at each side and fitting round under the tail; and the ashurma, a broad piece of carpeting, fitting over the quarters and fastened on each side to the roonaki keeping it in position. Tang —Girth for saddle. Koora —This is a kind of rough woollen saddle-cloth folded and laid over the saddle to prevent the load injuring the latter. In the cold weather also it can be used as a jhool. Sir-Kallah, head-stall, made of camePs hair rope with a chain across the nose. Dum-Ansar —Leading rope, made of camePs hair. To b ra —N ose-bag. Bar-band —Camel's hair ropes to fasten on the- load. Kaf-Koolaba. —This is a kind of broad surcingle to fasten over the whole load and under the belly so as to keep the whole load tight and compact. It is made of leather and hair with iron eyes at both ends by means of which the ends are fastened together by a rope. In addition to these, the following are required for every four or. five mules:— Kushao —Curry-comb. Slial —A small bag made of camel's hair answering the purpose of a brush or wisp. Soozan —A large packing needle to mend broken saddle, &amp;c. Palan-Kran —An iron scraper to clean the sweat off the saddle. The total cost of this equipment is about 37 krans (about 16 rupees), the saddle being the heaviest item, from 10 to 15 krans, and the breeching and koora about 6 krans each. The weight of the equipment is about 60 lbs.residency and musk at political agency for 1879-80. 19 The usual load for a good healthy mule is 320 IBs. This is in addition to his saddle, tkc., so that he really carries 380 H ds . The load is divided into two parts as equally as possible and fastened high up on each side of the saddle with cameFs hair ropes, the kaf- koolabah or surcingle being passed over all. The march. —The length of march made by caravans of mules, de- endino- as it. generally does upon the distance between places where the water, provisions, or protection is procurable, varies greatly through out Persia, as much as from three farsangs or farsakhs (one farsakh = 3i to 4 miles}, up to sixteen or even more farsakhs. The average length of march is about five farsakhs. The halting places, as well as the distances between them, are called manzils or stages, and mules are invariably taken the whole stage, however long it may be, in one march. No halts of any duration are made, but about every hour or farsakh, the leading pboo and all the mules stop of themselves for four or five minutes to stale, and then move on again. In the hot weather mules march about 6 or 7 o'clock p.m ., arriving at the end of their stage about 3 or 4&gt; o^cloek a.m . In the^ cold weather they march about 3 o'clock a.m . and arrive about 9 or 10 o'clock a.m. Shoeing. —Mules are shod about five times during the year; that is, about once every ten weeks. Each shoeing costs one kran (a little less than eight annas). The shoe universally used is a rather thin broad piece of iron which covers the greater part of the hoof, thus pro tecting the sole from injury by stones, &amp;c. It is fastened on by either four or six very largc-liGadGd nails^ two or threG on Gach. sicIg o £ tliG foot. The same kind of shoe is used for horses in Persia, and being small, the toe and outside crust of the hoof is well cut and rasped away to make the hoof fit the shoe, which latter, according to our ideas, would be much too small for the foot. This method of shoeing appears as it it would produce a tendency to contracted feet, but on the rough stony roads ot Persia it seems to answer its purpose very well. Epidemic diseases.— epidemic diseases which attack mules are two in number, ' Ranf or ' Koft' and ' Mashmashi.' These are both considered very contagious, and animals attacked are immedia e y sepaia- ted from the healthy ones and kept apart. ' Ranj is fata, an no remedy is known or attempted. The immediate symptoms are inm mg of the stomach and whiteness of the gums and eyes. ^ 01 ^ vc after attack the mule passes red urine, and its dung is quite re . . an] is said to occur at intervals of five or six years. It breaks ou m e ^ weather, and is very destructive, carrying off, I am told, as umc as e per cent, of the mules in a herd or caravan it attacks. _ Amma s a ac e are placed apart, and die in the cold weather, or (it is sai ) ^ en first drink rain water. Muleteers profess to carefully feed an en any mules attacked in reward for their previous services, but am mc in to doubt the good treatment, humaneness not being one o e vir inherent in the Persian character. 'Mashmashi' or glanders is also fatal, animals affected with it no being known to recover. The symptoms are profuse an mi i charge of yellow matter from the nose, enlargement o e ^ a b the jaw and surrounding the wind-pipe, and refusa o ee .20 administration report of the persian gulf political ' attacked generally die quickly, in twenty days or so, though some are known to linger on for a long time. No remedy is attempted; the mules attacked are simply separated from the others and allowed to die. Serrajak, Sore-hacks. —Serrajah is a malady which breaks out occa sionally in the cold weather. It corresponds to the Indian ' barsauti/' and shows itself as running sores on the legs. It is not dangerous or contagious, nor is it of frequent occurrence. The remedy resorted to in Persia is firing. Sore-backs and girthfalls are very common among the caravans, but little notice is taken of them. The mule with a sore-back is generally worked just the same as a sound mule. When the sore is small, the muleteer sometimes sews some padding on the saddle to prevent the latter pressing on the sore part, but when the wound is spread over a large surface, this remedy is impossible. When the sore is very bad indeed, the mule is laid up and not worked until the wound is healed, but it is very seldom that a Persian considers a sore bad enough to require this extreme (!) measure. The best application for sore-backs is said to be hen-eggs and wheaten flour beaten up together and made into a paste. This should be applied twice a day, the wound being previously carefully washed. I have never, however, seen this used. Miscellaneous. —The female mule is preferred to the male by the Persians, being considered stronger and more enduring. The Persians are probably correct in this estimation, castration accouuting for the deficiency of the males, making them more leggy, and endued with less stamina. There is no doubt that, as a rule, the chest measurement of the female is greater in proportion to her height than that of the male. Major Probyn, late on special duty in Persia purchasing mules, informed me that passing any mule under the standard, and then taking its chest measurement he could, latterly, almost invariably tell without further examination, whether it was a male or a female, from the greater propor tional chest measurement of the latter. Among the articles of a mule's equipment, previously described, I omitted to mention one, that from its universal use among the mules in every caravan would seem to be almost as essential as a saddle or a headstall, I mean a bell. The reason for the use of the bell is not quite clear; whether it is meant to enliven the monotony of the march for the mules (like the band for troops) and make them forget their fatigue, or on dark nights to indicate if the mules stop or stray; but it probably answers both these purposes. A considerable number of the mules in every caravan are decked with bells, generally one or more little merry tinkling ones round the neck and sometimes larger and deeper toned ones hanging down beside the saddle. Another institution in every mule caravan is the yahoo, a strong pony or galloway, which leads the cara van and is followed by all the mules. This leading yahoo carries a load just like the mules, and has, hung round his neck, a large bell of much deeper tone than the mule bells. It is remarkable how the mules follow this yahoo and show no disposition to stray, whereas, when there is no yaboo, I believe they frequently stray away and get lost or stolen. The explanation of this no doubt is that mules from following their mothers, and the herds of mares in their youth, get accustomed to relyresidency and muskat political agency for 1879-80. 21 upon anything in the shape of horse-flesh and thus docilely follow the vaboo. There are often several yaboos in the same caravan each, with their following of mules. In addition to the prevention of straying, there is another reason for the use of the yaboo, namely, to give a lead to the mules. The mule, though a very sagacious animal, is sometimes a very timid one, and, when frightened, exceedingly obstinate. If he takes' fright at anything on the road (and this may occur at a narrow spot with perhaps a precipice on one side) he will obstinately refuse to proceed. Tlie yaboo, a much bolder animal, gives the lead and the trusting mule follows without even noticing the object, which, had he been in front, he would have obstinately refused to approach. The yaboo seems to be a very good institution and might be adopted with advantage among the Commissariat mules in India. The stamina and endurance of the mule is quite remarkable. I have been told that on a route in Khorassan occasionally traversed by mule caravans there are three stages of sixty miles each, and the mules under heavy loads march one stage each day, never resting through fear of robbers. I have myself ridden a mule from Koonar-takhta to Boraz- joon on the Shiraz road, a distance of about twenty-six miles, over bad road. This mule had the same day carried a heavy chupprassee, and two large bags containing luncheon for four persons from Kazeroon to Koonar -takhta, about thirty-two miles, keeping up with us on horseback, although we cantered more than once. This made altogether close upon sixty miles, most of the time at a trot, and although the road was exceedingly bad and stony, and the latter part ridden in the dark, the mule never made one bad stumble or false step. r l his was quite a small, lean, ordinary looking mule, and, 1 regret to say (I discovered too late), had a very sore back. It was not nearly so tired as I was when we halted. I have given 320Ibs. as the load of a mule, but although the muleteers invariably say that this is the load, there is no doubt but that the load is generally muck greater, unless the mule is very young oi old or weakly. When the articles carried are bulky, it is not possible to load very heavily, but with articles like sugar, &amp;c., 4001bs. or more is the amount actually loaded on a strong mule; and they are well able to carry it. 1 am not sure of the limit of load fixed by the Commissariat for the mules employed in that Department, but I think I lemem er being told that it is JJOOlbs. If so, such a light load is simply a waste of force and energy, and by no means economical. Picked mules (as they are) will march just as well and quickly under double that load and without injury to themselves. The Persian muleteer is no oo , is quite well aware of the value of his mules, and would be t e as o load them to such a degree as to cause them ulterior injury. Mules in Persia are considered to be in their prime from four to nine years old, when they are said to commence to detenoia e. ey live and are worked up to fifteen and twenty years of age, ant a ew have been known to live to twenty-five. The rate of mule-hire varies at different times and in different places. On the Bushire-Isfahan road the usual custom is o pay y e22 administration report of the persian gulp political weight for heavy goods, by the box or bundle for lighter bulky articles for the whole journey, and by the day for mules engaged by travellers to carry their kit. Between Bushire and Shiraz the present rate for heavy goods varies from forty-five to sixty krans for 100 Tabreez mans (nearly SOOIbs.). In former times it used to be much lower, down, I believe, to twenty-five krans. For travellers hiring mules, the rates vary from two to five krans for each mule per diem, dependiog a good deal upon the rate at which they wish to travel. Supply of males in Persia. —As stated previously, the mules in Persia are bred by the nomad or Eeliyat tribes of the south-western districts, and it is among them and the professional caravan muleteers on the different trade routes that mules are alone to be found in any appreciable quantities. From the wandering and unsettled nature of these tribes, some of them almost independent of all control, added to the fact that it is quite hopeless to elicit the truth from any Persian, it has been impossible to obtain an accurate list of the number of mules actually in the country. The following list, however, giving the names of the tribes and of their Chiefs with estimated numbers of families and mules in their possession, has been compiled from the most reliable information procurable. For this list and the trouble of collecting the necessary information, I am indebted to Agha Mahomed Raheem, our confidential Agent in Bushire, and one of the most trustworthy Persians I have hitherto met. It must be understood, however, that this list is only approximate and cannot pretend to any high degree of accuracy. The Agent assures me that he has tried throughout to keep the figures rather below than above the mark.administration report of the persian gulf political In addition to the above the following districts contain mules in the possession of villagers, a few bred among the villages, but the majority purchased from the Eeliyats above described. These mules are used on the several routes as well as for local work : — Estimated num ber of mules. 1,300 ISo herds. 400 400 200 800 200 E bmaeks. Ditto. It will be seen from the above list that the three great tribes of the Kashkai, with its numerous subdivisions, the Bakhtyari and the Abu Ghadd^reh, are the chief breeders and suppliers of mules to the rest of Persia. The Kashkai are of Turk origin, and are scattered pretty well throughout the whole province of Fars; wintering in the lowlands and spending the summer in the elevated tracks between Shiraz and Isfahan. The Bakhtyari, also of Turk origin, are a very powerful and in dependent tribe rendering feudal allegiance to their Eel-Khani and caring very little for the Central Government at Teheran. They are divided into two principal divisions, the Haftlang and the Charlang with several subdivisions. Their summer quarters are the mountain pastures in the vicinity of Isfahan, the head-quarters being at Chukakore in the Chharmahal district about four farsakhs from Isfahan. In winter they pitch their camps in the lowlands about Shuster and Dizful, their head-quarters being three stages from the former place. The Abu Ghaddareh are a Kurd tribe living near the borders of Turkish Kurdistan, their head-quarters being not far from Zohab, The number of mules given in the above estimates are quite separate from the mules belonging to the professional muleteers, and employed by them on the principal trade routes. These latter are purchased from the Eeliyat tribes. They are generally purchased when three or between three and four years old. The price paid varies a good deal; a Charwadav (muleteer) informed me he generally paid from 30 I # .[0)111 M 6U fHillliresidency and muskat political agency fou 1879-80. 29 to 35 tomans (one toman =10 krans) for a good, strong, three year- old; but I should say the usual price paid was from 20 to 30 tomans. The number of mules in the possession of muleteers on the different trade routes may be estimated at- about 7,500. Of these about 3,500 are employed on the road between Bushire and Teheran, about 1,500 on tbe Teheran -Tabreez road, and about 2,500 on the pilgrim route from Teheran to Kerbela, on the route from Isfahan to Hamadan, on those from Shuster and Dizful to the Tigris, and other routes. If we allow another 1,000 for all the districts and villages not enumerated in the list, I think all the mules in Persia will be accounted for. The number of mules would therefore stand as follows :— In the possession of— Bakhtyari Eeliyats ... Abu Ghaddareh Eeliyats Kashkai Eeliyats Lur do. ... Arab do. Districts enumerated on list Others ... Professional muleteers Total ... 33,100 This gives a total of a little over 33,000 mules in Persia, and I am inclined to believe that this is a tolerably accurate estimate, though of course it cannot be implicitly relied upon. To show, however, how difficult it is to arrive at any accurate figure and how authorities differ, 1 may here quote the opinion of a resident of Bushire, an Aimenian merchant, who kindly furnished some information on the subject ol transport animals in Persia. This gentleman writes; 'If, however, were to make a good guess upon information I have from time to time obtained upon the subject of rearing mules in the different parts of Persia, I would feel inclined to credit the kingdom on the whole with an army of over 1-50,000 mules \ \' I believe that previous to the year 1870 there was a much larger supply of mules, horses, and other animals, but large numbeis pens iu , in the two years of scarcity, 1870 and 1871, and the countiy las nevei recovered.

The first occasion that mules were purchased in Persia by Govern- NOTE .-For the Crimean war mules ment was for the Abyssinian expedition were drawn, I believe, from Turkish in 1867-68. At the end of August Arabia. 1867 Captain R, Clarke, Assistant Com missary-General, was deputed by the Bombay Government to the Persian Gulf to purchase mules. Captain Clarke appears to have proceeded direct to Busrah and to have confined his attention chiefly to Baghdad and Turkish Arabia, though, no doubt, many of the mules he purchased must have come from Persian Arabistan. At the end of September Captain Clarke's assistant. Lieutenant Hobson, was deputed to Bushire and authorized at first to spend Rupees 75,000 in purchasing 300 mules with equipments and forage; he was subsequently authorized to exceed this amount, and he drew altogether from the Bushire Treasury Rupees 1,73,251. I cannot find out exactly what number of mules he succeeded in purchasing, as- the records do not seem to be complete, and a great portion of the money must have been spent in paying forage, giving advances to owners of chartered vessels, paying muleteers, purchasing shoes, &amp;c. I find, however, applications for passes for four batches of mules between 21st October 1867 and 20th January 1868. The number of mules was 254, and the average prices from 300 to 312 krans per mule. In March there was another batch of 121 mules averaging 390 krans per mule in price. The price of mules therefore on this occasion would seem to have commenced at about an average of 300 krans (about Rupees 130), and to have gone up in the end to an average of 390 krans (about Rupees 170) per mule. No standard of age, height, or chest-measurement seems to have been fixed, but it was left to the discretion of the officers deputed. Lieutenant Hobson, I believe, remained stationary in Bushire, and the chief difficulties he seems to have encountered were runaway muleteers and the obstructiveness of the local Persian officials, necessitating frequent telegrams to and from Teheran. C? Five per cent, export duty was charged on all mules exported from Bushire. The next occasion mules were obtained from Persia was in 1877, when the Bombay Government, with the view of testing the Persian Gulf as a source of supply, on 7th July 1877 addressed the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, asking if the dealers would be willing to supply twenty mules (for use in the mountain batteries) in the ensuing cold season, and saying that Government would be prepared to purchase the animals on the following conditions, viz., age to be between four and seven ypars; height not under fourteen hands; girth measurement sixty- seven inches; price Rupees 300 ; to be delivered in Kurrachee. A dealer in Shiraz engaged to supply twenty mules on these conditions, and they arrived in Kurrachee in December 1877. Three of these mules were rejected, two being over age &amp;ud one unsound.BESIDENCY AND MUSKAT rOLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1879-80. . 31 The seventeen accepted were reported to have turned out very well, and the following: year twenty more mules being required (one for No. 1, and nineteen for No. 2 mountain batteries then in Quetta), the Adjutant-Gene ral of the Bombay Army in November 1878 wrote recommending this number to be procured from the same dealer if possible. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, was again addressed to this effect, and requested to procure the twenty mules at the same rate as in the previous year, viz Rupees 300. It was found, however, that the dealers had increased their prices (probably owing to the rejection of the three mules of the last batehat Kurrachee), and would not undertake the contract at a less price than Rupees 350 per mule. As the second mountain battery, for which the majority were required, was on service, and delay was inexpedient, this price was authorized, and the same dealer at Shiraz accepted the contract. The mules were delivered in Kurrachee at the end of February 1879, and were all accepted, although four of them were over the contract age. Lastly, in October 1879, Major Probyn was deputed to purchase mules in Persia for use in Afghanistan. His instructions were to pur chase 400 mules for artillery purposes ; age between five and nine years; Jie'ioht not under thirteen two and averaging fourteen to fourteen two hands; girth fifty-five inches for all below fourteen hands, and sixty inches for all above fourteen hands. He was also to purchase about a,000 mules for transport purposes, size and standard not so high as for artillery, but to be thoroughly efficient as pack animals. Previous to Major Probyn's arrival, endeavours were made to collect in Bushire a large number of mules for his approval. Batta at twelve annas a day per mule had to be allowed to induce the muleteers to remain, and about 700 were thus collected at a cost of about llupecs (3,000. Major Probyn arrived on the 27th October, and out of this large number of mules collected could only select and purchase seventy-six at an average price of Rupees 216. On the 1st November he proceeded to Shiraz, and between the 13th November and 3rd December succeeded in purchasing at that place 267 mules at an average price of Rupees 182. Major Probyn then returning to Busbire embarked for Baghdad alter buying thirteen more mules in Bushire at an average price of Rupees 2U. He remained in Baghdad meeting with but indifferent succegs, until Apn 1880, when he went to Shuster, and there purchased 2o^ mules at an average of Rupees 181 per mule. Major Probyn had every prospect oi being able to secure large numbers of mules in Shuster, when the purchase of mules was stopped on 7th April, and he was recalled to n la. In February, as the purchase of mules had been proceeding slowly and speed was required. Major Probyn recommended the apP oinfc ment ol Mr. J. R. Preece, Superintendent on the Persian Telegraph Line, to p chase mules in Shiraz. This appointment was sanctioned, and d g the couple of months before the purchase of mu es ^ „oo succeeded in obtaining 850 mules at an average price o u l )e , n of these were for artillery, and 470 of the remainder mea hands and over. , _ r- An export duty of 5 per cent, on all mules shipped was charged by the Persian authorities, but at Mohamm ,32 administration report of the persian gulf political mules purchased at Sinister were shipped, the Governor, Shaikh Haji Jabir Khan, Nusrat-ul-Mulk, would not levy any duty, sayiug that the English Government was his friend. The B. I. S. N. Company carried all the mules to Kurrachee from whatever port in the Persian Gulf at the fixed rate of Rupees 30 per mule. The chief difficulties Major Probyn had to contend with were insufficient information as to the best places to go to for mules, and difficulty in procuring current coin to pay for the mules when bought. To these I think I may add—until the appointment of Mr. Preece at Shiraz—want of assistants. It appears, then, that on four occasions mules were bought in Persia for Government, namely, in 1867-68, 1877, 1878, and again in 1879-80. On the first and last occasions only were officers specially deputed to purchase. In 1877 and 1878 the numbers required being very small, twenty each time, the mules were obtained by contract from a Persian dealer, and were delivered in Kurrachee. In deducing any hints for future guidance as to the best method to adopt for purchasing mules in any considerable numbers in Persia should occasion occur, we must chiefly have regard to the proceedings on the last occasion in 1879-80, as the conditions of the country have con siderably altered since 1867-68. By noting the difficulties Major Probyn encountered, so as to avoid the same as much as possible in the future, and observing where he met with success and the reverse, we may pretty clearly indicate what would be the most advisable course to pursue on any future occasion. I am of opinion, however, that this course might have been apparent from the first to any one thoroughly acquainted with the country and paying attention to the habits of the mule-owners and caravans. It has been seen that the mules are in the possession of wandering tribes and of muleteers, and thus are constantly on the move. The caravan mules never remain more than a couple of days at one place, and, although the same muleteers sometimes go over the whole country, their usual habit is to remain on one beaten track; thus there would be one set of mules continually on the road between Bushire and Shiraz, another set between Shiraz and Ispahan, another between Ispahan and Teheran, and in the same way upon other routes. It is evident that moving about to obtain animals, which are also constantly on the move, is a mistake; and that the proper plan would be to take up a stationary position in a central place where mules are constantly passing and repassing. This is the more requisite in a country void of railways or decent communications like Persia, where travel ling from place to place involves time. Again, if s|teed is required, more than one purchasing agent is required, as there are several routes and centres of mule districts, and one agent cannot be in several places at the same time. At first sight it would appear that Bushire would be a good place to fix upon to obtain mules, as caravans of mules are daily coming andeesidency and muskat political agency tor 1879-80. 33 going bringing down up-country g-oods for exportation and taking back imported goods, and that an agent at Bushire could select from these caravans and ship them off to India. There are several reasons how ever against this plan. In the first place I have said that generally the same caravans of mules ply between Bushire and Shiraz, so the number of these is limited; also the road is a very bud one, with numerous kotuls and forage scanty j the mules on this road are conse quently out of condition, and the majority have sore backs. Again, the muleteers can always find immediate employment, and will not sell their animals except at exorbitant prices, especially as they cannot replace them by purchase among the Eeliyats without returning into the interior. Major Probyn's experience proved this. Out of 700 mules collected in Bushire at a large cost, he was only able to select a small proportion owing to sore backs, &amp;e., and out of those selected, he could only secure seventy-six, the prices asked being exorbitant and the muleteers refus ing to take less. Even these seventy-six cost on an average Rupees 216 each, and were thus considerably dearer than any of the mules subsequently purchased elsewhere. Muleteers live by their profession, and when they sell any of their mules, they immediately purchase others, and naturally they will be more ready to part with their animals in places where they can immediately replace them, i .e., in the centres of the mule-breeding districts. As mules purchased by Government are always required to be trained and fit for service, it is to the professional muleteers chiefly that we must look for a supply. Positions for purchasing agents therefore should be chosen on caravan routes and also, as far as possible, in the centre of mule- breeding districts. Three large towns fulfil these conditions admirably, namely, Shiraz, Ispahan, and Shuster. These three places form a triangle commanding the whole of the mule-breeding districts of Persia. The sea port for Shiraz and Ispahan is Bushire; that for Shuster, Mohammerah, at the junction of the Karoon river with the Shatt-el-Arab. Major Probyn's experience bears out this opinion. At Shiraz Major Probyn purchased 267 mules in a fortnight's time, and subsequently Mr. Preece secured 850 more within two months. At Shuster also Major Probyn met with success, and I believe his opinion is that it is about the best and cheapest place of all. It is certainly in the centre of the Bakh- tyari country and not far from the Abu Ghaddareh. Ispahan was not tried, but had more mules been required, Mr. Preece intended proceed ing to that place and would assuredly not have been disappointed. Should therefore any future emergency arise when mules may be required and Persia be resorted to for a supply, I am strongly of opi nion that the best, quickest, and in the end most economical course^ to pursue would be to depute an officer and two assistants. The assist ants might be drawn from Persia if competent persons were available. One officer should be stationed in Shiraz, another in Ispahan, and the other in Shuster. They should be provided each with a suitable number of sowars or trustworthy Indian sepoys to go with each batch of mules despatched to the port of' embarkation, for no Persian is to be trusted. On the last occasion the Persians sent in charge of the mules fiom Shiraz to Bushire invariably sold their barley, starved them, and on e mM. mm34 administration repout of the persian gulf political one occasion changed some of the mules on the road. Suitable redress from Persian officials it is impossible to obtain. It would be necessary for the officer deputed to appoint native forwarding agents at Bushire and Mohammerah to take over charge of the mules sent down, see after them until shipped, ship them, provide stores of barley and straw, &amp;c. In good years barley and straw can be procured in the country, but in bad years it would be advisable to send compressed hay and barley from Bombay or Kurrachee. A large remuneration would not be requisite for these forwarding agents, as, unless forage is supplied from Bombay or Kurrachee, they can generally make a little profit in supplying barley and straw. Major Probyn succeeded in engaging an excellent man in Bushire. The difficulty of obtaining money to pay for the mules is one hard of remedy. Arrangements made with large firms and sufficient notice given to them that a certain amount of money would be required in a certain place would seem to be the best plan, unless sufficient influence could be exerted at Teheran to force the local Governors to supply money at a fair rate for bills on Teheran or elsewhere. Were sufficient notice given to any large mercantile firm (Gray, Paul and Co. for instance) or to more than one, they could arrange to supply krans at Shuster, Shiraz and Ispahan at a fair rate. Of course to purchase mules it would always be necessary to have the sanction and good-will of the Persian Government. Strict orders from the Central Government should be obtained and sent to all the local Governments concerned, and it would be well if these orders were repeated from time to time, otherwise obstructions are sure to occur. With regard to the price to be paid for mules it must vary at dif ferent times, but it would generally be possible to obtain a good stamp of mule, thirteen hands and over, and girth at least fifty-six inches, at the three places I have named, for an average price between Rupees 180 and Rupees 200. The price actually paid for a mule invariably exceeds to a greater or less extent the sum of money the owner of the mule receives, as a portion, sometimes large, always finds its way into the pockets of third parties, some of whom are apparently quite unconnected with the sale. This annoyance is unavoidable, and all an officer can do is to try and allow as little as possible to be so diverted. The cost of feed, conveyance, &amp;c., of the mules from the place of purchase to, say, Kurrachee would be ;— Per mule. From Sinister about ... ... ...

Shuster is the cheapest place, as it is usually possible to obtain grazing for the mules on the road to Mohammerah. On the last occasion no export duty was levied at Mohammerah, and each Shuster mule's expenses were less by Rupees 10.residency and MUSK.iT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1879 80. 35 To sum up: should mules in small numbers only be required and pwl be no obiect^ it might be most advisable to obtain them from dealers by contract as was done in 1877 and 1878, but i£ delay were ' expedient, it would be best to depute an officer to Shuster. If, however, 1 .ere numbers are required and in a limited time, it would be advisable that three officers should be employed: one officer to be stationed at Sbiraz commanding the mule routes from Bushire to Shiraz, Ispahan to Shiraz and Yezd to Shiraz; one at Ispahan commanding the mule routes from Shiraz to Ispahan, Teheran to Ispahan and Hamadan to Ispahan; and one at Shuster commanding the routes from that place and Dizful to Hamadan, to Mohammerah and to the Tigris, and in the centre of the Bakhtyari country. Three officers thus distributed could, I am convinced, procure 2,000 fine mules, fit for service, in six or seven weeks' time, and 2,000 more within two months. Bushire, 1880.

[Note. —In order to acquire a general knowledge of the Wahabee phase of the history of Nejd from the beginning down to the present time, it is necessary to con sult several published works and official records. It will be found that authorities vary on many points, and in no work have I been able to find a clear account of the family of the Wahabee Amirs. Several years ago Colonel Herbert, then Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, procured me, from Abder-Rahman-ibn-Feysal, brother of the present Amir, and at the time a detenu at Baghdad, some details of the family history and lineage, and on this basis I framed the genealogical table appended to this Memoir. The table was also inspected by 'Abdullah-ibn-Thaneyyan, another member of the Al-Su'ood family, through the medium of Mr. P. Robertson, Assistant Political Agent at Busrah, and pronounced correct so far as it extends. Having subsequently received some Arabic memoranda regarding El-Hasa annals, and having occasion to compare the various accounts of Nejdean affairs by me, it occurred to me that a connected summary of Wahabee history with the table of Amirs, would be convenient for reference, and with a view to adding to any useful ness it may possess, I have, as far as possible, indicated my sources of information.] Outlines of the history of the Wahdbees of Nejd and the Al-Su'ood Amirs. At the period preceding- the rise of the Wahabee power, Nejd* * Vide Administration Report for was divided into numerous petty inde- 1878-79, Part I, paragraph 29. pedent districts or townships, each ruled by the tribal Chief, and from the frequent intertribal feuds, and [Ar. MS.] p re datory habits and disposition of the Bedouin Arabs, chronic disorder and insecurity prevailed. The founder of the Wahabee sect, the reformer, Mohammed-bin- Mohammed-bin-'Abdul Wahab. 'Abdul Wahab, was born in the year 1691 A.D., in the village of 'Eiyeynah [Burckhardt.] ^ ' Ei y a » ah ) near El-Der'eyyah, his father being of the tribe Temeem of the ■'Adnanite or Ishmaelite stock of Arabs. In his youth he went to Busrah, and perhaps to Damascus, to study religious law, and after making the pil- [Mengin, who follows the Shaikh grimag-e to Mecca and Medina, returned Abdul-Rahman-bin-'Abdullah-bin-Mo- to his native country, and soon after hammed-bin-'Abdul Wahab.] married in the village of Horeylama. About the year 1742 A.D. he was engaged in preaching to the A.D. 1742. people of 'Eiyeynah, exhorting them to reform their religion, amend their lives, and abide strictly by the precepts of the Koran. His attention appears to have been primarily directed to removal of the ignorance of their religion which he observed in his fellow-countrymen; to the cor rection of abuses and laxities which he complained had crept into the doctrines and practice of Islam generally; and to the restoration of that faith to its pristine purity. Ignoring all existing spiritual authorities, he appealed direct and solely to the fountain-head of the religion. The points he chiefly insisted on were : observance of the prescribed prayersVft®- ifft) residency and muskat political agency for 1879-80. 37 (five times daily); the fast and the pilgrimage ; abstinence from spiritu ous liquor and tobacco; refraining from games of chance and the practice of magic; condign punishment of prostitution and other social offences, a s well as of bearing false witness; prohibition of usury and of the wearing by men of silk or ornaments; forbiddance of the erection of FMen ..] monumental structures, and demolition of all such as existed as tending to idolatry. The last-mentioned precept led to the destruction by the Wahabees of many monuments and tombs at the various holy places, notably the tombs of Mohammed, Hossein, &amp;c., at Medina and Kerbela. On occasion of performing these congenial religious duties, the Wahabee armies, at the same time, acquired immense booty. The injunctions of the Koran regarding intolerance of unbelievers, and the duty of making war on them were also invested with renewed importance. Exemplifying the proverb, the inhabitants of his native village failed to honor the teaching of Mohammed-bin-^Abdul Wahab. Some instance of his severity was resented, and he was dismissed from ^Eiyeynah, and of | obliged to remove to the neighbouring town of El -Der'eyyah where he was well received by the Chief Mohammed-bin-Su^ood* who adopted the tenets of the reformer. The remainder of Mohammed-bin- , Abdul Wa- hab's life was spent in Der'eyyah where, after marrying twenty wives, . by whom he had eighteen children, he [i engm.j died on the 14th of June 1787 A.D. at the age of ninety-five. Mohammed-bin-Su'ood,t the first Wahabee Amir, belonged to the 'Anazah tribe which derives from 'Adnan through Eabee'ul-Faris and El- Asad. The branch of which Mohammed-bin-Su'ood was Chief was the Mesalikh, an offshoot of the Weled ^Ali. Many of the inhabitants of El-Der'eyyah, following the lead of the Chief, speedily joined the sect of Mohammed-bin-'Abdul Wahab, and others flocking from the neigh bouring districts swelled the number now at the disposal of Moham med-bin-Su'ood who became the temporal head of the reformed religion, and according to the sectarians themselves, the head of all Islam. Guided by the counsels of Mohammed-bin-'Abdul Wahab, and assisted by bis son 'Abdul 'Azeez, Mohammed-bin-Su ood gradually established his authority over most of the districts of Nejd, but El-Hasa under the Benu-Khalid Shaikhs held [Mengin.] sllccess f u lly against him till his death in 1765. The Benu-Khalid had about the year 1669 A.D. established themselves in the province of El-Ahsa or El-Hasa, under the Shaikhs * Note .—According to some accounts, Mohammed-bin-Su'ood married one o is daughters, or gave him a daughter in marriage.

The hardest contests of Mohammed-bin-Su^ood were with the Benu-Khalid of El-Hasa and the people of the neighbouring and rival . town of El-Eiadh under their Chief engm .j Daham-bin-Daus. Over the latter he was successful^, and forced Daham to pay tribute. On the death of the Amir Mohammed, his son ^Abdul 'Azeez was A.D. 1765. elected to succeed him. This Prince had 'Abdul 'Azeez-bin-Mohammed. already seen much active service in command of his fathers armies, and was known to be an able and zealous leader. After his succession, 'Abdul 'Azeez, in his turn^ em ployed his son Su'ood to conduct his military operations. Warfare con tinued to be waged by the Wahabees against El-Riadh, which was at A D length taken by 'Abdul 'Azeez in 1772, and the Chief Daham having evacuated the fort fled to El-Hasa. In the wars between the Wahabees and El-Riadh, upwards of 3,000 men are said to have fallen on either side. Su'ood-bin-'Abdul 'Azeez, the Amir's son and General, was constantly on the move, engaged against hostile tribes towards both 'Irak and El-Hasa. The. latter district he twice reduced to submission—first A .D. 1795. in 1792 A.D., and again in 1795, and [MS.] Wahabee Governors and Mutawa'as were placed in charge of the province. The proceedings of the Wahabee Chiefs about this period excited the attention and indignation of the Turkish Government, their raids having been freely carried into Turkish territory, so that alarm was even felt for the safety of Busrah. Orders were accordingly repeatedly sent to Suleiman Pasha, Wali of Turkish Arabia, to send an expedition to occupy El-Hasa and chastise the Wahabees. An irregular force of Arabs having been first tried, and having failed, the Pasha in 1798 despatched his ' Kahiya' or Secretary, 'Ali, in command of an expeditionary force of 4,000 or 5,000 Turkish infantry and artillery, with a large contin gent of Arab irregulars collected from the Montefik, El-Dhafeer, and r™ . uto o i other tribes under Ibrahim El-Thakib. [ Mengin, MS., &amp; c.] ^ to E ,. Hasa with his force, reduced that province, with the exception of the fort of Sahood of El-Mubarriz and the citadel (El-Koot) of Hofhoof, which held out against him for upwards of two months, after which time, by advice of his Arab colleagues, the Turkish Commander aban- doned the siege and returned with his [ . . engm.] force northwards. Su'ood-bin-Moham- med intercepted the retreat of the Turkish army, and took up a position at the walls of Taj. A battle was imminent, but was averted by the mediation of the Arab Shaikhs. 'Ali Pasha continued his retreat to Busrah, and Su'ood marched into El-Hasa, where he punished those who had submitted to the Turks, and rewarded the garrisons of Sahood andresidency and muskat political agency for 1879-80. 39 el -Koot. The plantations of all others were confiscated, and Snleiman- bin-Majid placed as Governor of £1- L J Hasa. This affair contributed much to the extension and stability of the M ahabee power, and offers of sub mission came from all sides; the Amir, nevertheless, thought it prudent to endeavour to conciliate the Turkish Wali, by amicable overtures and the despatch of valuable presents of horses, &amp;c., to Baghdad. After the settlement of the affair of El-Hasa, Su'ood proceeded on [Mengin.] a pilgrimage to Mecca accompanied by A.D. 1800. some 4,000 armed followers; and in the year 1800 he repeated the pilgrimage. During the year 1800, an attack was threatened by the Wahabees on the possession of the Sultan of Muskat, and Seyyid Sultan went to Eis-el -Kheymah to concert means of frustrating the intention. The [Government Selection.] following year a Wahabee force under [Mengin.] Salirn El-Hark, one of the Amir's Memlooks, invaded 'Oman. In the year 1801 Sn'ood-bin^Abdul 'Azeez marched with 20,000 men to Kerbela, which town he entered A.D. 1801. on 20th of April. The male in habitants were put to the sword, the tomb of Hoosein demolished, and immense booty secured. The slaughter and pillage having lasted for eio-ht hours, the Wahabees withdrew from the town the same afternoon. The 'Uttoobee Shaikhs of Bahrain having been attacked in 1801 by [Mengin.] the Sultan of Muskat, fled to Zobarah a.d. 1802. on the mainland and sought the assist- [Government Selection.] ance of the Wahabee Amir which was accorded in 1802, with the result of recovery of the islands by the Bahrain Chief, who, in return, engaged to pay tribute to the Wahabee. At this period the latter dominated the entire coast-line as far as the Batinah on the Gulf of 'Oman. Several of the 'Oman tribes embraced the Wahabee faith and became tribu- a.d. 1803. taries of the Amir, and the conclusion of a truce alone saved the independence of the Sultan of Muskat. A quarrel having occurred between the W ahabee Chief and Ghalib, the Shereef of Mecca, in the year 1803 A.D., Su'ood-bin-'Abdul 'Azeez marched with a force of Wahabees, and after reducing Tayif, entered Mecca at the head of his army on the 1st of May of that year. 1 hough appearing as declared enemies of the Shereef, the Wahabees, howevei, did not on this occasion demean themselves as a hostile force, but enteied the town in the guise of pilgrims, and strictly refrained from plundei- ing, or otherwise molesting the general body of the inhabitants. At the same time they proceeded, in pursuance of their religious convictions, to raze to the ground ' all the large tombs in the city which the people generally worshipped and believed in, so that there did not lemam an idol to be adored in that pure city.

The Amir Wbdul ^Azeez may be said to have at this period attained to the zenith of his power, all Central Arabia, except the isolated city of Medina, having acknowledged his supremacy. He now turned his attention to the Muskat principality, and prepared for its invasion. This design, however, was frustrated, and his career ended by his murder, on AD 1803 O^ 0 ^ 61 ' 1803, by a Persian Seyyid, at the age of eighty-two years. On the death of the Amir ■'Abdul ^Azeez his eldest son Su'ood was „ , ,recognized as the successor, and issued Su ood-bm- Abdul Azeez. 0 , .. . . , . , a proclamation promising strict protec tion of life, property, and commerce throughout his dominions. In the course of the following year the Amir Su'ood plundered . D 1sn . the environs of Busrah and sent forces to Ras-el-Kheymah on the ''Oman Coast to levy a share of the booty taken by the piratical cruisers of that place. In 1807 he marched to Meshhed-'Ali, but was foiled in an attack on A D 1807 wa ^ e ^ town, and forced to retreat. Two years later he collected an army of 30,000 men with the intention of attacking Baghdad, and had actually commenced his march, when disturbances in his own territories led to the abandonment of the design. In the same year Su'ood made the pilgrimage to Mecca, for the third time, at the head of 50,000 of his people. On the p Men . return journey he visited Medina, which had now submitted to his authority. During the three preceding years Su'ood had acquired a footing, through his agents, in many parts of the 'Oman principality, and under shelter of the Wahabee power the piratical depredations of the Jowasim and other maritime tribes extended so as even to threaten the coasts of India. This led to the interference of the British Government and the despatch of a naval and military expedition against Ras-el-Kheymah in 1809, resulting in the capture and punishment of that place. In 'Oman the Wahabee arms continued to gain ground, and about A.D. 1810 ^ ear -^10' during the Amir's absence on an expedition into 'Irak at the head of 30,000 men, his sons Sa'ad, Nasr, and Toorkee, and his agent, Mutlak El-Muteyree, joined by a Ghafiree Shaikh, Mohammed- bin-Nasir, penetrated to Matrah, and afterwards to Soor and Ja'alan, [Records 1 where they were opposed by the Beni- bu-Hasan tribe, whilst the Beni-bu-'Ali adopted the Wahabee faith.residency and muskat political agency for 1879-80. 41 The Amir Su^ood distrusting the sincerity of the J tJttoobee Chiefs A D 1811- of Bahrain, Selman and 'Abdullah, in vited them to Der'eyyah on pretence of wishing to confer, and detaining- them there, placed an agent of his own in charge of the Bahrain Islands.

Friendly communications were exchanged between the Shah of Persia and the Wahabee Amir, the former having sent an Envoy to [Mengin.] request safe passage for his subjects pro ceeding to M ecca through Nejd. On his return from the last mentioned expedition into 'Irak, Su'ood had made a fourth pilgrimage to Mecca in 1810, and on his homeward march he visited Medina. On this occasion the Amir went so far in the display of sectarian zeal as to cause the tomb of the Prophet to be A D 1810 opened and the rich jewels and precious relics it contained to be sold or distri buted amongst his soldiery. This sacrilegious proceeding excited the indignation of the Mohammedan world generally, and in no small degree contributed to bring about the disasters which subsequently befell the Wahabees. The task of punishing the Wahabees was committed by the Turkish Government to the able Viceroy cf Egypt, Mohammed 'Ali Pasha, who in the year 1811 despatched an army under his son Tousoun Pasha, and Mecca was recovered from the Wahabees without any resistance. The Amir Su'ood, however, collected a force of 15,000 men under the com mand of his son 'Abdullah, and on the army of Tousoun Pasha advancing r . further inland, it was attacked in the eilDl mountain defiles by the Wahabees and defeated. At this juncture Su'ood endeavoured to conciliate the Persian r ~ i. 0 , Government, and sent an Envoy for the LOovernment Selection.! . 01 • ^ tt i a purpose to Shiraz. He also made over tures for an alliance with the British Government, which were rejected. Under Tousoun Pasha the Egyptian forces had made no impression, having advanced only as far as Tayif, 'Garden of Mecca/' and 4,000 out of 8,000 regular troops had perished. But Mohammed 'Ali attached much importance to a successful issue of the operations against the Wahabees, considering that his influence at the Porte would thereby be much strengthened; so on hearing of his son's failure, he determined to proceed in person to Arabia. Proceeding by sea to Jiddah, he landed at A D 1813 that place on the 28th of August 1813, . * and pushing on to Mecca, at once seized L engin,J the Shereef Ghalib, whom he distrusted, a nd sent him a prisoner to Cairo.42 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Tousoun Pasha again advanced and attacked Tarabah, but failed, and his force retreated with some loss to Tayif. Mohammed 'Ali then pre pared to renew the campaig-n. Such was the position of affairs when news was received of the death of the Amir Su^ood-bin-^Abdul ^Azeez, which occurred at El-Der'eyyah on the 17th of April 1814, he having attained the age of sixty-eight years. A.D. 1814. ^Abdullah, the eldest son of Su^ood, had been elected to the succession during his father's lifetime, and, on the death of the latter, took his place as 'Abdullah-bin-Su'ood. Chief of the Wahabees without opposi tion. In January 1815 Mohammed 'Ali inflicted a defeat on the Wahabee A D 1815 army which was 20,000* strong, and shortly after returned with his own troops to Jiddah. Tousoun Pasha continued the campaign, and operating from Medina, entered the town of El-Rass, the capital of the district of El-Kaseem ; the army of the Amir 'Abdullah-bin-Su'ood being then at 'Aneyzah, little further east. At this juncture Mohammed 'Ali, who had again advanced to Medina, received the news of the landing of Napolean from Elba, and immediately returned to Egypt. Tousoun, however, was reinforced in El-Kaseem, and having opened negotiations with the Wahabee Amir, the latter sent his uncle, 'Abdullah-bin-'Abdul 'Azeez,,to the Egyptian camp to conclude a peace which was effected, the terms being on the basis of the Amir's submission to the Sultan of Turkey, and engagement to give hostages, and even to present himself in person at Constantinople if required by the Sultan to do so. 'Abdullah further agreed to surrender Der'eyyah to whomsoever the Sultan should appoint to be Governor, and to make restitution of the valuables plundered from Medina by the Wahabees under Su'ood. The submission of the Amir on this occasion was the more unaccountable that the Egyptian array was at the time in a critical position, and by operating on its communi cations and intercepting supplies, the Wahabees might have destroyed it. The Amir so far fulfilled the terms of the treaty as to despatch deputies and hostages to Egypt, but he nevertheless proceeded to punish those of the Arab tribes who had joined [Mengin.] the Turks, and to prepare for the defence of El-Der'eyyah. The Viceroy, on learning the terms of the peace concluded by his son, refused to ratify them, demanding that 'Abdullah should person- ally appear before him in Egypt to answer for his conduct. He also dismissed the Wahabee Envoys and sent further reinforcements to Arabia. About the same time Tousoun Pasha, hearing of the occurrence of a revolution in Egypt, hastened to return there, leaving garrisons in Medina and other towns. ■jiiarnff ID, 1816. «ij( * Note .— The Wahahee forces were collected and marshalled by clans and districts.

The Amir also wrote at the same time to Tousoun Pasha asking him to intercede in his favor with the Viceroy. The latter refused and returned the presents which accom- . panied the Amir's letter, and announced ' ' his intention of sending his son Ibrahim Pasha with an army to destroy El-Der'eyyah and bring the Amir a prisoner to Constantinople. 'Abdullah thereupon despairing of a peace ful issue prepared to fight. Arrangements having been completed for renewal of the campaign A D 1816 against the Wahabees, Ibrahim Pasha, who was selected on account of his ability to conduct the operations, set out from Egypt in September 1816 at the head of a considerable force and proceeded to the scene of action. The first encounter seems to have taken place at El-Ma'wiyah, where ' Abdullah-bin-Su'ood attacked the May, A.I). 1817. Egyptian army and suffered a signal defeat. On this occasion Ibrahim Pasha put to death all prisoners taken. The Pasha then advanced with 4,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry, besides contingents of the friendly Arab tribes Benu-Khalid, El- Muteyr, El-'Oteybah, El-Harb, and El-Suhool against El-Rass, which was held by a Wahabee garrison. Before this town Ibrahim Pasha suffered a serious check, and after besieging it for three and a half months, having lost 3,U00 men, he was obliged to agree to an armistice and abandon the siege. The Egyptian General, however, masking El-Rass, continued to advance eastward on 'Aneyzah, and the Amir retired south to Bureydah. After six days' bombardment the fort of 'Aneyzah surrendered, and the entire district of El-Kaseem then submitted to the Egyptian Commander. 'Abdullah retired on Shakrah, a town in the district of El-Washam, where he halted two months for reinforcements. During this time the Pasha succeeded in detaching from the ahabee cause many of the Arab Bedoos who at heart disliked the strictness and severity of that sect and government. Amongst those who,^ actuated by ancient enmity against the Wahabee, had from the outset joined the Egyptian side, was the powerful Shaikh of the Muteyr, 1 ey sal-el - Dawis , who trusted in a promise made to him by Ibrahim to place mm in Der'eyyah as Governor of Nejd, a promise which the Pasha had no intention of fulfilling. Having received at Bureydah a reinforcement of 800 men and two guns, as well as supplies of provisions and ammunition, Ibiahim ^ ^ was able to continue his advance on Shakrah at the head o , Turkish, Albanian, and Moorish troops December, A.D. 1817. in addition to Arab contingents. About 10,000 camels accompanied the force, and the infantry soldiers weie usually mounted two on a camel. The \mir Abdulla mean ime retired on his capital wasting the country before the enemy, an sen the surplus cattle and flocks to El-Hasa. This was in the latter part ol44 administration report of the persian gulf political December 1817. In the following month the Turkish army appeared before Shakrah, which was regularly approached under the direction of a French Engineer, M. Vaissiere, and capitulated on the 2nd of January AD 1818 1818. The lives of the garrison were spared, but they were deprived of their arms, and had to engage not to serve again under the Wahabee Amir. Some time after, when El-Der'eyyah had fallen, Ibrahim Pasha caused the fortifications of Shakrah to be demolished, and when seen by Captain Sadleir the place was in ruins. ^Abdullah-bin-Su'ood had now retreated to El-Der^eyyah, and before following him up to the capital, Ibrahim Pasha judged it advisable to turn aside from the direct route to take the town of Dhorama. At that place he encountered a spirited resistance, several of his men being killed. In revenge for this the male inhabitants were put to the sword, the town pillaged and destroyed, and the women given up to the brutality of the Turkish soldiery. Only the Governor and his guard who had shut themselves in a citadel were suffered to escape with their lives. Detained by rains, it was March before Ibrahim Pasha advanced on El-Der'eyyah, which town he invested in April with a force of 5,500 horse and foot, and twelve pieces of artillery, including two mortars and two howitzers. Shortly after, reinforcements and convoys of supplies reached the Turkish camp from Medina and Busrah. The siege operations were for some time conducted without any success to the Turkish arms, and in the latter part of the month of May an explosion having occurred by which the Pasha lost all his spare ammunition, his position became extremely critical. Indeed the indomitable courage and good example of Ibrahim personally alone saved the army from disaster. The troops suffered much from dysentery and ophthalmia, and the Wahabees thought to overwhelm the besiegers by a sortie in force. The attack was, however, repulsed, and the opportunity lost to the besieged; for soon after the engagement caravans with fresh supplies of ammunition and provisions reached the Egyptian camp, and later reinforcements of infantry and cavalry joined. News was also received of the approach of Khaleel Pasha from Egypt with three thousand fresh troops. Early in September the Amir sent a flag of truce to request an audience of the Pasha. This was accorded, and the Wahabee Chief was kindly received, but was informed that the first and indispensable condition of peace was the attendance of ''Abdullah in person at Cairo. The Amir asked twenty-four hours for reflection, which delay was granted, and at the expiration of the time he returned to the Pasha's camp and intimated his willingness to fulfil the condition imposed, provided Ibrahim would guarantee that his life would be spared. Ibrahim Pasha replied that he had no authority himself to bind the Sultan and the Viceroy on that point, but that he thought both were too generous to put him to death. 'Abdullah then pleaded for his family and prayed that El-Der'eyyah and his adherents should be spared. These terms were conceded and a peace concluded. The ill-starred Amir at once set out on his journey under a strong escort, and on reaching Cairo was cour teously received by Mohammed 'Ali Pasha, who forwarded him on to Constantinople with a strong appeal for his pardon.

The Amir ^Abdullah whilst inheriting- the courage, is reputed to have lacked the ability and generosity of his father Su^ood, and it is probable that under the latter the Wahabees would have made a more successful resistance to the Turkish arms. After the surrender of 'Abdullah, Ibrahim Pasha, by order of his father commenced his return march, and the Viceroy insisted on the [From this point Mengin's history destruction of El-Der'eyyah which was ceases to be available for reference.] accordingly burnt.

He joined a Turkish detachment under orders to march westward from El-Hasa, and travelled in their company. Passing- El-Der'eyyah^ he found that town in ruins, and saw not a single inhabitant. Shakrah also had been razed to the ground. The Envoy eventually reached the camp of Ibrahim Pasha near Medina, and, on unfolding- the purpose of his journey, it turned out that, as suggested by the Sultan of Muskat, the General had no authority to enter on the negotiation, and could only refer the proposals to his father, the Viceroy of Egypt. The latter ultimately intimated that neither he nor the Porte desired or needed foreign aid in dealing with the Wahabees of Nejd. In the following winter the projected attack on Ras-el-Khaimah A.D. 1819-20. was successfully made by a British force, [Government Records.] the Sultan of JVTuskat co-operating. In the year 1822 it was reported from Nejd that Mohammed A D 1822 'Ali Pasha had posted a detachment of cavalry in 'Aneyzah, and had ordered the walls of El-der'eyyah to be rebuilt.

It was stated that on his return from Nejd, Ibrahim Pasha took with him several of 'Abdullah-bin-Su'ood's brothers, amongst them Khalid- bin-Su^ood.

As Khalid had numerous adherents amongst the Arabs, ieysal had to retire to El-Hasa, and Kbalid with his Egyptian auxiliaries took possession of El-Der'eyyah and El- Riadh. Some hostilities ensued, but on the arrival of Khorsheed Pasha with further reinforcements, Feysal was so hard-pressed that he suuen- dered himself and was sent a prisoner to Cairo. Khorsheed Pasha then cast aside Khalid who had been merely a tool in the hands of the Egyptian Com- A.D. 1838. manders, and having established the authority of the Egyptian Government over all Nejd, prepared to enforce the submission of the Bahrain Islands also.

One of tbe first steps be took was to prepare to send a force under Sa'eed- bin-Mutlak to reduce 'Oman to obedience. When tbe Chiefs of 'Oman appealed to tbe British to save them from subjection to the Wababee Chief, they were informed that the previous policy of opposition to the progress of tbe Wabhabees in their direction bad reference to extension of the Egyptian power, and, as that was no longer apprehended, no in terference was contemplated on their behalf. Feysal having at the same time made friendly overtures to tbe British Government, they were responded to in the same spirit. Nevertheless, when Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak, A.D. 1845. ^ ie ^ enera l an d Agent of the Amir Feysal, threatened Muskat in the year 1845, he was met by a British naval demonstration on the Batinah Coast. On this occasion tbe Regent of Muskat engaged to pay a yearly tribute of 5,000 dollars, and on that condition peace was concluded. The fort of Bereymee continued in the occupation of the Wahabee Agent, a posi tion from which he could dominate the pirate coast and command the [Government Selection.] passes to Eastei n Oman.

About this period the Beni-Yas Chief of Abu-Dhebbi, Za'eed-bin- Khaleefah, having been ejected from his town by a relative, appealed for aid to the Amir, who instructed his agent in ^Oman, Ahmed El-Sadyree, to assist the Shaikh, who recovered his authority. Mohammed-bin-^Abdullah had, in 1843, been expelled from Bahrain, the government of which he had seized the previous year, and for A D 1859 several years the ex-Chief had resided at Demam under Wahabee protection; until in the year 1859 Feysal determined to support him in recovering the government of the islands, and made preparations to give him active assistance. A demonstration was thereupon made by the British squadron which had the effect of frustrating the scheme to the intense annoyance of the Wahabee Amir. On the British Resident demanding the expulsion of Mohammed-bin-^Abdullah from Demam, Feysal replied in terms of bitter reproach, inveighing against the policy of the British Government in denying his right of suzerainty over Bahrain and the 'Uttoobees. The Amir was able to complain with truth that the actual Chief of Bahrain, Mohammed-bin-Khaleefah, had provoked his resent ment, and rendered himself justly liable to reprisals by inciting the tribes of El-Katr to acts of aggression against Wababee subjects. In 1861 the Bahrain Chief went so far as to 6 cruise with six armed boats against Demam, a proceeding which was disapproved and censured by the British Government. Pressure was brought on Mohammed-bin-Khaleefah to force him to withdraw his vessels to his own waters, and he was bound by treaty, in 1861, to refrain from such acts of aggression in future. , ' Bv the action of the British squadron [Government Records.] towards Demam, the same year, the refugee Shaikh Mohammed -bin-^Abdullah was forced to quit that place. .50 administration report of the persian gulf political In August o£ 1865 a combined force of Wahabees and Jenebah ^ ^ tribe attacked and plundered the 'Oman port of Soor, during which affair certain British subjects were sufferers.

Before further measures could be taken, the old Amir Feysal-bin-Toorkee died. For some years before his death he had been incapacitated for work by blindness and feebleness, and the power had been virtually exercised by his son ^Abdullah, who now succeeded as Amir.

These assur- r .. ,. , rr ^ ances having- been accepted by the Bri- [Aitchison s Ireaties.J j-i/^ , n ji * • tish Government, no further action m reference to past offences was taken. As had been anticipated, soon after tbe death of the Amir Feysal a contest commenced between his eldest son 'Abdullah and the latter's A D 18f71 more popular brother Su'ood. After a course of hostilities with varying uooc- m eysa . results, in the spring of 1871, Su'ood decisively defeated his brother, and was recognized as Amir by the mass of the Wahabees. ^Abdullah, become a fugitive, decided on having recourse to the Turkish Government, and appealed for assistance .. „ ^ , to Midhat Pasha, thenWali or Governor- iue narrative or the events con- „ i c m i • i a i • mi i nected with the Turkish occupation of General of l urkish Arabia, ihe latter El-Hasa is chiefly from a memorandum deemed the opportunity favorable for ™ r *r S , he £ by , M M- J ', C ' RobertsoI1 &gt; establishing the authority of the Porte H.

The inhabitants of Riadh, displeased at the overbearing conduct of Su'ood's Bedouin followers, now rose under the leadership of ''Abdullah-biu-Toorkee, and forced Su'ood to retire to El-Katr. 'Abdullah-bin-Toorkee then wrote to Nafiz Pasha and •'Abdullah-bin-Feysal reporting that he had expelled Su'ood and requested orders. In reply, Nafiz Pasha appointed him (&lt; Mudir' of Riadh pending the arrival there of 'Abdullah-bin-Feysal, and sent him money and provisions to aid him in holding the place. Su'ood next collected a force of the 'Ejman and Al-Morrah and Dowasir Bedoos and attacked the Turks in El-Hasa, but sustained a defeat. It was not long ere the Turkish authorities ceased, even in appear ance, to act on behalf of 'Abdullah-bin-Fey sal. It was alleged that the chief people of El-Hasa had addressed a petition to the Sultan praying His Majesty to take Nejd under his direct rule and appoint a Turkish Governor instead of a member of the Al-Su'ood family. The El-Hasa notables certainly maintained that they were under the impression that the petition they signed related to the assessment of the date groves, &amp;e., but in November Midhat Pasha appeared personally in El-Hasa bearing a gracious and favorable reply to the said petition. A notification was issued that the ' Al-Su^ood had ceased foreign,' and that Nafiz Pasha was appointed Muteserrif or Governor of Nejd; whereupon 'Abdullah- bin-Feysal fled from the Turkish camp to Riadh.. After unsuccessful efforts to induce 'Abdullah to return to the Turkish camp, Raoof Pasha, who had A 1 ' succeeded as Goyernor-General of Turk ish Arabia, opened communications with Su'ood in spring of 1872, but failed to persuade him to place himself in the power of the lurks. He, however, sent his brother 'Abdul Rahman accompanied by Fahad-ibn- Suaitan to El-Hasa to negotiate. 'Abdul Rahman was induced to accompany Haji Ahmed Khan, who had been sent by the Pasha to treat, to Baghdad, where he was retained under surveillance until August 1874. Fahad-bin-Suaitan who had remained in El-Hasa was accused by Mohammed Pasha, who had succeeded Nafiz Pasha as Muteserrii, of intriguing, and sent in irons to Baghdad. 'Abdullah-bin-Feysal held possession of Riadh for a short time, but was again ejected by Su'ood, who retained possession until his deat in December 1874; 'Abdullah during that period residing near Kowey . In El-Hasa, Mohammed Pasha was succeeded by Faizi Pasha, and in 187^ Redif Pasha, now Governor- A - D - 1873 - General, was ordered to withdraw the regular troops from El-Hasa, arid to incur no further expenditure. At the advice of Nasir Pasha, Muteserrif of tlie Montehk Arabs, his brother-in-law Bizee 'a-bin-'Aree'ar, a Shaikh of the Bern- la i ' descendant of the old rulers of El-Hasa, was appointed Governor ot tnat province, and was installed by Nasir Pasha who went to El-tlasa toi me purpose.

Crossing to the mainland he was at once joined by bands of the Al-Morrah, ^Ejman, and other tribes, at the head of whom he marched on El-Has^,. The inhabitants welcomed him, and after a number of the Turkish gendarmes had been slain, the rest with Shaikh Bizee^a were besieged in the fort of Hofhoof. Nasir Pasha, who had pledged himself to the success of the plan of appointing Bizee^a, was called on by lledif Pasha to quell the insurrec tion, and despatching 300 Arab horsemen by land proceeded himself by sea with a battalion of regular infantry to El-Hasa. Discord had broken out amongst the adherents of ■'Abdul Rahman in El-Hasa owing to the jealousies of the leading Shaikhs of the •'Ejman, and on the approach of Nasir Pasha^s force they dispersed, and ^Abdul Rahman joined Su'ood at .El-Riadh. The fort of Hofhoof, in which Bizee^a with his garrison had been shut up, having thus been relieved, the town was by order of Nasir Pasha given up to pillag-e, and for several days the Turkish soldiers and the Arab auxiliaries indulged in the indiscriminate massacre and plunder of the inhabitants; men, women, and children were shot down, and women openly treated with the brutality peculiar to such occasions. It is said that the Turkish officers remonstrated with the Pasha on permitting and even ordering such severities, but Nasir Pasha replied that it was necessary to make an example to prevent revolt in future. , Nasir Pasha left his son Mazyid Pasha with 800 regular infantry and otic hundred cavalry to hold El-Hasa, and^himself returned to Busrah. Su^ood-bin-Feysal having died in 1874, his brother ^Abdul Rahman A 18)75 held Riadh for some time against ^Ab- dullah-bin-Feysal, but the latter gradu- ally got the upper hand, and eventually the brothers came to an amicable understanding, and have since resided together, -'Abdullah being regarded as Amir and Abdul Rahman his Minister, Such is the position at the present time. Negotiations which were recently opened on the basis of 'Abdullah-bin Feysal becoming Governor of Nejd as a Turkish nominee led to no result. In El-Hasa, Sa'id Bey succeeded Mazyid Pasha as Governor on the part of the Turkish Government, and the subsequent Governors have been Hussain Bey, Eneyetullah Effendi, and Sa'id Pasha. The latter was, last autumn, on oocasion of the appointment of a new Wali to Busrah, relieved by Sa'id Bey, who is thus for the second time Governor.

On g u 'ood's death in 1814, a period of decline ensued dating from the defeat and capture of'Abdullah by Ibrahim Pasha and subjugation of Nejd. Under the subsequent Amirs until the second accession of Feysal-bin- Toorkee in 1843, Nejd remained more or less in subjection to Turkey. From the return of Feysal in 1843 until his death in 1865 may be considered as a period of revival of Wahabeeism, as that Amir restored the portion of Nejd he ruled to a position of independence, and main tained the Wahabee faith in its strictness and integrity. On the death of Feysal, the struggle which ensued between his sons, resulted in a second period of decline of the Wahabee power, and the occupation of El-Hasa, the richest of the late Amir's provinces, by Turkish troops. Whether the fall is final or Wahabeeism will again emerge from its present political obscurity it would be premature to predict; the ele ments surrounding the question are eminently uncertain and unstable, but it has been observed that with political power the religious zeal and ardour of the Wahabee sectarians have relaxed. The tenets of Mohammed -bin-'Abdul Wahab are not wholly forgotten, but much of the fierce fanaticism of the earlier converts has disappeared, and the puritanical strictness and austerity which characterized the sect are decidedly on the wane.

The Prophet Mohammed be ong- ed to this stock, and was of the twenty-second generation from Adnan, whose period is placed at about 300 B.C. The great rival division consists of the Arabs of Yemen descende( from Kahtan, and these are designated Yemenite Arabs. Kahtan is often supposed to be identical with Joktan of Genesis, but the period of the latter must have been fully 2,000 years B.C., whilst the Arabs calculate this Kahtan to have lived 400 years before Adnan, or in J3.U 700, leaving a discrepancy of 1,300 years. Kahtan is by some ia ic historians asserted to be descended from Ishmael. Arabian historians employ four terms- in classifying the various Arab stocks, and aie not in accord in the application of those terms. They are . El-'Arab El-Badiyeh. „ „ El-Aribeh* „ El-Mota' Arribeh. „ El-Mosta'ribeh. The terms Aribeh and Mota' Arribeh frequently are taken to indicate the Kahtanite stock, Mosta ntek being applied to the Ishmaelites These divi sions also are sometimes designated re spectively ' pnre' [or ' gennine ] and ' naturalized' Arabs. Abul-Feda says, historians divide the Arabs into three classes • (1) Badiyeh, (2) 'Aribeh, and (3) Mosta'ribeh. The first were the lost tribes of Ad, Thamud, and Jorham the elder, who weie es i J 11 * Also, El'Arab'ul-'Arba. „ „ -'Aribat and 'Ara- biyyeh. Also, El'Arab'ul-'Aribab.

The second are the Arabs of Yemen descended from Kahtan. The third are descendants of Ishmael, son of Abraham. Another account taken from Ibn-Dihhiyeh divides the surviving- Arabs into: 1^, El-^Aribeh, Arabs par excellence, claiming descent from Iram [Aram of Gen.^ X., 23], son of Shem; Ind, El-Mota' Arribeh, naturalized and not Arabs, descended from Kehtan; 3^, El-MosWribeh, still less pure Arabs, descendants from Ishmael. I extract yet another account from a note in Chenery's translation of Hariri:—' Shem was the primate of the earth, after his father, and according to his father's blessing, became the ancestor of the Prophets, all of whom, whether Arabs or foreigners, are of the posterity of Shem. He went as far as Yemen and founded San'a, and settled in the middle region of the earth from Yemen to Esh-Sham, possessing the holy place. Erom him were descended Ad and Thamud and Tasm and Jedis and El-Amalik, and the subjects of Ya'rob and Jorham the elder, who were called El-'Arab El-'Aribeh, because they were creating speaking Arabic; also the descendants of Ismael, called El-^Arab El-Mota' Arribeh, because they acquired the Arabic tongue by settling among the former; also El-^Arab El-Mosta'ribeh, who are defined as specially the descendants of ^Adnan.'

A scanty rainfall in the winter and spring of 1879 entailed partial failure of crops in South Persia. In consequence of this check to the export trade in wheat, &amp;c., there was a considerable decrease in the number of steam-ships sailing between the Persian Gulf and Europe. As the season of 1880 has proved still worse along the Persian Coast, the harvest in Dashtistan and other districts having entirely failed, this condition of affairs must continue at least until the summer of 1881; and should next autumn and winter be equally unfavourable, famine must ensue. Already much distress doubtless exists, but fortunately the extreme scarcity is not universal in Persia, and many have removed to the more favourable upland districts. It is likewise fortunate for South Persia and adjacent lands that the Indian harvests were favourable, as grain is now being imported from India. Nevertheless unusually high prices rule everywhere. The cultivation of the poppy in Persia is yearly extending to fresh districts, and now about Shiraz and in Behbehan it is occupying much of the land. This industry is generally regarded as highly beneficial to Persia, as increasing the revenue, affording employment to a large number of labourers, and lessening the exportation of specie for the purchase of foreign commodities. Notwithstanding the misfortune of the bad harvest, the returns of the Bushire Custom-house, so far as can be ascertained, compare not unfavourably with former years, and it is said that the farmer of the Custom-house, though paying an enhanced rate for lease, was by no means a loser. The Afghan war is said to have caused some increase of exports and imports at Bunder Abbass, as some caravans went there instead of to Kurrachee, but detailed returns have not been procurable. The following memorandum, pointing out some measures which it is deemed would place British trade in South Persia on a better footing, has already been submitted, but is now added to this report for con venience of future reference.

Report on the salt caves and mines and trade in salt in, the Persian Gulf, by Assistant Surgeon Adder RaheeMj dated Bassidore, 20th March 1880. From what is at present known of the existence of rock salt in this part of the Persian Gulf, it would appear that the area lying between latitudes 26° 10' and 27° 10' north, and longitudes 53° 50' and 56° 30' east, is an extensive area, abounding in a large deposit of salt, which crops out at various places on the earth's surface, rising up into ranges of rocks of no little magnitude. The following are the principal places from which salt is obtained in the salt area noted above:—Kowin on Kishm Island, Hormuz, Larak, Pohal (near Khamir), ' Sir-bu-Nafair,' Jabal Bostana, and Hameran on the Persian Coast. The general appearance and character of the salt-bear ing rocks here being that they are of a reddish colour from red ochre, varying from earthy consistence to stony hardness, which covers the salt deposit and is more or less mixed with it, imparting it a red tint. The ochre is associated to a small extent with specular iron ore. The associ ation of this ochre with salt is so constant in this salt area that the ex istence of the former is almost a sure indication of the presence of the latter. Indeed, from the general appearance of the rock at Hameran, I suspected it to contain rock salt, long before its discovery by the natives. About sixteen miles from the Bassidore Station in a south-easterly direction and three miles from the village of Kowin on the Island ol Kishm, is a range of rocks bordering the sea, and consisting veiy large y of rock salt, covered in some parts by red ochre, while in others large masses of salt of stony hardness aud reddish tint are seen to compose the surface and mass of the rock, giving it the appearance of a structure made of red bricks and mortar. The salt cave with its briny stream, described by Mr. . Johnston, is situated in the western end of the range. Besides tins t ere are severa other places in this range where briny water issues foith, an co ec ing in hollow ground close to or removed from these rocks, eposi s eau i ful crystalline masses of salt by spontaneous evaporation. is that some forty years ago the salt was largely proeme y is me 10 , numerous shallow pits were excavated, where as the bime evapoia e , deposited salt, which was then collected for commercia pmposes. since the people took to quarry the salt the pits weie neg ec.e , as process was tedious, and the salt obtained being sir a m quan i y not good in quality for commercial purposes. However e s iea brine and some of the pits still exist, and yield a portion of salt foi home consumption. The working of these salt mines during the past thiity ^ ^ has given rise to large caverns in the bowels ot the ioc .66 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL these caves from the trickling- of brine, stalactites of various shape and magnitude are formed, yielding- snow-white masses of salt of saccharoid description. The salt occurs in four principal forms: 1^, pure white masses easily reduced to granules; Ind, red masses of stony hardness; Zrd, saccharoid masses from trickling of brine; and Uh, translucent and transparent masses of cubical forms. In some of the tianslucent specimens I found pure crystals of sulphur adhering- to or enclosed in the mass. The granular form is the one of commercial value. It is o-enerally of a pure white colour. One specimen was of a darkish colour from an admixture of specular iron ore and to a small extent a metallic sulphide (bismuth ?). The red, hard blocks of salt are principally used by the natives for salting fish. Indeed the existence of such an extensive deposit of salt in a district where fishery is carried on to such a large extent seems to be a provision of the Almighty for the benefit of his creatures. The salt is dug out by means of crow-bars. Sometimes during the working of these mines people are buried alive from earth-falls. The mines which yield the present salt are situated about half an hour's walk from the sea-shore ; the path leading to them winds between the rocks, and is difficult for the camels. The salt is brought on the beach by the camels, costing about four and a half krans per ' Bahar ' of 400 maunds of nine pounds each, and taking the custom charges at one and a half kran and the cost of quarrying at a dollar, the total cost of the salt on the beach would amount to dollars per ' Bahar.' Recently salt of a very good quality is being quarried from the rocks close to the cave described by Mr. W. Johnston, the distance from the beach being only about a hundred yards, so that the cost of carriage is saved to the miners. The salt mines at Hameran are also extensive; they are situated about an hour's walk from the sea-shore. The salt occurs in beds of about four feet thick with intervening layers of earthy material. The salt-beds are hard in consistence, and are broken by means of gun powder, the masses being subsequently reduced to granules by wooden and iron mallets. Some of the specimens here are of a pale greenish colour from an earth of that tint; this earth exists in isolated deposits and mounds varying from earthy softness to stony hardness, the green tint seeming to depend upon Manganese. The quarrying expenses here are about one dollar per ' Bahar/' camel-hire being four and a half krans, and boat-hire to Lingah being three krans, making a total cost of 2^ dollars per ' Bahar.' Should the vessels demanding salt go to Hameran, boat-hire would be saved to them. No doubt in the working of these mines improved implements of quarrying, improved roads and means of carriage would greatly facilitate the work and reduce labour. Large quantities of salt are exported by native boats to Muskat, whence it is carried by merchant vessels to Bengal, Zanzibar, Mauritius, Batavia, &amp;c., and merchant vessels bringing rice, sugar, &amp;c., to the Gulf, also on their return take a cargo of salt, generally at Lingah. On an average from 25 to 30,000 tons of salt are exported annually from these mines; the best specimens being from the KishmT residency and muskat political agency for 1879-80. ^ * i T1 (\ and ' Sir-bu-Na£air.' The price of salt at Lingah varies from 4 to 5 dollars, while at Muskat from 5 to 6 dollars per ' Baliar.' In connection with this subject it may not be out of place to state tliat there are certain springs in the rocks close to the village of ^ lakh' opposite to Henjam, the waters of which are warm and charged th salt yielding naphtha of a reddish colour. It is highly bustible burning with thick smoke. The natives use it for purposes Tr ht and use it locally for rheumatic complaints. The existence of vsfals of pure sulphur in the salt noted above, and the existence in «taia places o£ salt springs charged with sulphuiecus gases, leads one nm analogy, to snspcct the existence o{ sulphur on the Island of Kishm, like what is found associated with earthy gypsum on the Persian mainland. m ■ Mr68 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL APPENDIX B TO PART III.

A t tbe commencement of the official year 1879-80 there was con siderable anxiety in Muskat caused by Tolitica . the intrigues then carried on by Sheikh Saleh bin Ali and Seyyid Abdool Azeez against His Highness Seyyid Toorkee. These two Sheikhs endeavoured to persuade Seyyid Burgash, the Ghaffiree Chief, to join them in rebellion, but as he refused to do so, the coalition collapsed, and by May public confidence had been restored. In June rumours of disturbances were again current, as it was assert ed that the Mettowas acting under Sheikh Saleh's instigation were organizing a rising in the name of His Highnesses brother, Abdool Azeez, but all anxiety on this score was dispelled, when it was ascertained that the call to arms met with a very feeble response, and it became evident that a coalition of the tribes was at all events for the present improbable. In June it was reported that Gwadur, a dependency of Muskat, was in danger of being attacked by the Rinds, a powerful Belooch clan; so Her Maiesty^s Ship Ready proceeded there to protect British interests, as the garrison maintained by His Highness was weak and inefficient for the protection of the place. In a short time the garrison was reinforced, and as a detachment of the Marine Battalion was sent there by the Resident in the Persian Gulf, all fear of an attack being made by the Rinds passed away. In July, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was alarmed by a report, which turned out to be groundless, that Sheikh Hamood bin Saeed El Jahaafee al Wahibeh had left the Jenebeh tribe, under whose protection lie had been living ever since he had become reconciled to him through fliPir i nf.PTPPSftlOTl. Early in August, Major Euan Smith, the. Political Agent visited the chief towns on the Batineh Coast m Her Majesty s Ship Vvltme, and satisfied himself as to the security of the British Indian subjects residing in that part of the country. With the exception of some slight local disturbances in the Semail Vallev between the Hinawi and Ghaffiree tribes, which were speedily and satisfactorily arranged by His Highnesses officers, nothing serious has occurred to disturb the peace of ^Oman. The Khore Jiramab again became an object o£ contention between the people of Has El Had and those o{ Soor; so on the written request of His Highness the Sultan, Her Majesty's Ship to/ty proceeded there, and through her presence there a satisfactory, though piobab y only a temporary, arrangement of the dispute was e ec e . Seyyid Bedr bin Seif, late Governor of Sohar, who in 1^ was deported to Zanzibar, returned to Muskat on the ^ f j ness the Sultan, who shortly after his return appoin Muttrah. V134 administration report of the persian gulf political In February the fort of Bethel Ainan, in the province of Dahireh^ was wrested from the Beni Ghafir tribe by Belooch colonists residing-in its vici nity, who asserted that they held it on behalf of His Highness the Sul tan.' In countenancing this act, His Highness has given offence to Sheikh Burgash, the Ghaffiree Chief ; the policy of the measure is very doubtful. His Highness has added a considerable tract of country on the Hadramant Coast to his possessions during the past year, but his sove reignty over the tract in question is on so insecure, a basis that it would be premature to consider it an integral part of Oman. On the 27th April, Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, Political Agent, proceeded on pri vilege leave making over Official changes. charge to Dr. Jayakar and returned on the 15th M-ay. In June, Lieutenant-Colonel Miles was appointed to officiate as Political Agent in Turkish Arabia and proceeded to Baghdad, making over charge of his office to Surgeon Jayakar under the orders of Government. On the 16th July, Major Euan Smith, who had been gazetted as Political Agent at Muskat, arrived and assumed charge. Major Euan Smith was in turn relieved by Surgeon Brereton on being posted to Kandahar on special political duty. Dr. Brereton held charge from the 3rd January to the 25th February 1880, when he was relieved by Major Charles Grant. This trade is fast dying out owing to the vigilance of Her Majesty's cruisers on the East African station, and no cargoes have arrived in His Highness the Sultan's territories in the year under report. In July the British Ship Fathool Carrim of Singapoor, bound from Jeddah to Singapoor, put into Muskat in distress and was condemned by a board of survey convened under the orders of this Consulate. She subsequently (after the setting in of the N.E. monsoon) sailed to Bombay under a provisional pass, after undergoing extensive repairs, one of the conditions under which she sailed being that she was to have a bughla in tow to save life in case of danger. There has been a marked increase in the trade of the port during ^ j the past year, as will be seen from the trade returns accompanying, the exports being nearly double that of the preceding year, and there has been an improvement also as regards the imports. The date harvest was an exceedingly prolific one, and the exports under this head alone are more than double that of 1878-79; while the rice imports also compare favourably with that of the previous year. As a sea-port, the small town of Soor, situated a few leagues west of Has El Had, is daily rising in importance as a trade entrepot, and this is owing chiefly to the fact that traders are there able to evade the import duty which His Highness is not sufficiently strong to protect. The rainfall during the year under report has been nil. The Muskat customs, which includes that of Muttrah, was farmed for 110,000 dollars. (Sd.) Charles Grant, Major, II. B. MJs Folll.
