The letter notes that the enclosed translation was forwarded by the Agent at Sharga [Sharjah] and differs considerably from the copy forwarded to the Resident by Sooltan ben Suggar.Translation of a letter from Rahma ben Jabir to Shaik Sooltan ben Suggar, received at the Residency 28 December 1826: regarding intelligence that Toorky ben Abdalla [Turkī ibn ʻAbd Allāh] had established himself (as ruler) and had the support of the Badowin [Bedouins] and that his area of influence extended from Jubel Shoomar [Jabal Shammar] to Asseer [‘Asīr]. The letter also claims that orders had been received from England that prevented British officers interfering with Arabs and the peoples of the Gulf and any attempts made by the Resident to prohibit rulers from taking action could be ignored as they no longer had any power to enforce it.Extract of a translation of a letter from Sooltan ben Suggar to Colonel Stannus, 28 November 1826, informing the resident of the contents of a letter received from Rahma ben Jabir which claimed that the British had given free permission to everyone (in the Persian Gulf) to do as they pleased at sea and that they would not interfere with anyone among the Arabs, and that the order had come from the King of England.The translations were undertaken by Samuel Hennell, Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024197023.0x000068#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
