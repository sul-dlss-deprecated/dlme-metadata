The 15th of December, 1946. /“Uj Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No.3139 of the 30th September, 1946? 2. The position as regards the ’’hospital” at Dohah is that a few years ago the Shaikh of Qatar started to build a ’’hospital”. The funds for this were provided in part, I believe, by the American Mission and possibly the shaikh gave some money himself. I believe also that the Mission provided some money for drugs. I am pretty sure that my information is correct, but I hesitate to ' ask the Mission. 3. The shaikh of Qatar has now written to me asking for assistance in importing building material for the dispensary from Bahrain. Bahrain has not got the material to spare at the moment, and so the building is likely to remain in the unfinished state it has been in for the past few years. Furthermore I feel disinclined to help in the establishment of an American assisted dispensary. 4. There is, however, need for medical facilities at Dohah and I should like to be in a position to assist the Shaikh in the provision of drugs, equipment, building material and also a doctor. Now that Petroleum Concessions Limited’s activities are growing this would appear to be the proper time to increase His Majesty’s Government’s prestige- and this would follow the establishment of a dispensary. I suggest we should follow the precedent of the Trucial Coast The budget figures for the Trucial 1. pay of Establishment 2.

If there is any hope that the Shaikh of Qatar will agree to the enforcement of Article VIII of the Treaty of 1916 and the appointment of a political represen tative, say of the status of the Residency Agent at Sharjah, I am inclined to think it preferable that he should be tackled on these lines. What are your views ? 4. If you still think it better to employ the subterfuge of a doctor for the time being, would you kindly supply me with material for the development of the thesis as requested by Donaldson. Lieutenant Colonel A. C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, BAHRAIN. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. ...Date. &amp; ~ G.A.M.i Ext.187/47. My dear Hay, Will you please refer to your d.©^letter to Weightman No. 1186-S of 21st December, 1946^ recommending the setting up of a dispensary at Dohah in Qatar. 2. I am afraid that in present circumstances there is little likelihood that the Government of India will sanction funds for any new undertakings in the Gulf, seeing that Weightman is well that H.M.G. are about to propose that they should take over control, both administrative and financial in that area. If a dispensary is established, it will no doubt have to be on funds provided by H.M.G. and not by the Government of India. 3. I can well understand that, with the expansion of P.C.L’s operations and with the general difficulty of communication in the Gulf, there must be a good deal of political work in Qatar which the Political Agent, Bahrein, is not well able to supervise. If you consider that the Sheikh is unlikely to agree to a formal enforcement of Article VIII of the treaty of 1916, there seems much to be said for the suggestion that the work might be undertaken by a medical officer who could combine the two functions. 4. While we-can give no undertaking that H.M.G. will make any funds available for this project, I feel that it is one that should be considered here if the Government of India refuse to play. I should, however, be grateful for a further development of your thesis that there is political work to be done in Qatar that cannot readily be handled by the existing political authorities, and that this could be done by a medical officer. If it can be shown that there is a real call for both political and medical super vision in Qatar, a good case might be put up to the Treasury to provide the funds required. 5. For obvious reasons I am not sending a copy of this letter to India. Yours sincerely, Sd. E. P. DONALDSON.

The 5th of March, 1947. Dear Colonel Hay, Will you please retar to your demi-official letter No.238-8, dated the 7th February, 1947? 2. I cannot say that I am in favour of the creation oi a post on the lines of a Residency Agent Tor I ohink them a relic of the past. They were necessitated by difficulty of communications, poorness of living conditions, type of work, lack of suitable officers ¥/ith linguistic attainments, etc., etc. None of these will apply in the present case where modern conditions will soon prevail, and I think that we keep abreast of the times and post a political oiiicer when the time comes. Incidentally, I was never in favour of the subterfuge of a doctor and did not suggest it. My proposal was to assist in the medical field and generally to keep His Majesty’s Government’s prestige alive. 3. I see no reason why the Shaikh of Qatar should not agree in due course to the implementation of Article VIII, and indeed it will be necessary that he should if P.C.L. grows up on the same scale as BAPCO entailing passport work, a mass of correspondence, judicial work both criminal and civil, and a hundred and one other things. In addition a Chief Local Repre sentative is provided for in the political Agreement. 4. As things are at present, however, and while P.C.L. still have their headquarters at Manama I am of the opinion that the Political Agent, Bahrain, can sufficiently supervise Qatar affairs.

After Compliments, On a previous occasion I spoke to Your Excellency about the construction of a Hospital at Duha (Qatar), this being indispensably required for treatment of those inhabitants who are in need of such treatment. This, as Your Excellency knows, is a philanthropic project, behind which we aim to afford medical facilities to those who are patient and needy. The Hospital has now been constructed in accordance with the xiiix advice given by the doctors who visited us, notably Dr. Storm and I beg to inform Your Excellency that the building of the hospital has been completed and implements, medicines and the dorctor have been provided. We would like to have it run; but in the meantime we feel that we cannot dispense with your' advice in this respect. We request that you would allow Dr. Storm to proceed to our side in order to supervise the operation of the hospital. For this act I shall be very grateful.to you. Usual Ending. cjldential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT.D.O. No.C/992 1947. The 3rd of October, Dear Colonel Galloway, please refer co the correspondence resting with one of my predecessors' demi-official letter NO.C/3C3 . dated the 5th of March, 1947. 2. I enclose a copy in translation of a letter received from the Shaikh of ^atar. 3. On the 1st October Storm called and asked for per mission to visit Qatar the next day. As all the arrange ments for the crip had already been made, and as I knew that Steele was coo busy to go, I raised no objection. 4. In the course of conversation 3tom told me that the ohaxkh had sought his advice on the design of a hospital building and had later asked him what equipment should be bought. Storm told me that he had assisted the Shaikh in the design of the building; and had bought Hs.5,000/- worth of equipment, for *?h.ich the Shaikh had paid in full. The equipment has arrived and is awaiting delivery to Qatar in the Mission uospitai here. 5. Storm assured me that the fission had only helped with advice and as purchasing agents for equipment, and that they had contributed no money at all to the Shaikh’s hospital. 6. Storm offered to let me know, ^dien he returned, exactly how the project was proceeding. 7. While I appreciate the good //ork the fission are doing and, as we are at present unable to do it ourselves, /would not wish to discourage them, I feel that giving advice to the Jhaikh of Qatar on details of his local administration is properly a political function; and that we should be sufficiently staffed with doctors to be able to perform this function with the help of our own Agency or Residency Surgeon. At the moment the Agency Surgeon and Quarantine Medical officer is officiating as Residency Surgeon in addition to his own duties and is also acting as Chief Medical Officer for the Bahrain Government. His quarantine work alone, if properly done, is a full time job; and I feel that we need a separate Residency Surgeon and that the Bahrain Government should have sufficient European doctors of their own to be able to give them the leave due to them without having to call in anyone from outside whenever their Chief Medical Officer goes on leave. % The Eon'ble Lt-Col.

It would appear that the establishment of a hospital by the American Mission in Qatar is a fait accompli. I see no grave objection and I imagine H.M.G. will be glad to be relieved of the responsibility and expense. 4. It is no longer feasible now to post in Qatar a Government doctor who whuld also act as a political representative. In due course I think we shall have to post a second assistant to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for Qatar affairs and if possible arrange for him to live on the peninsula, but this matter can wait for the time being. I have discussed the point with Lermitte who says he does notthink there will be any necessity for a political officer to reside in Qatar for another twelve months but that one is likely to be required then.

Though it is perhaps unfortunate from our point of view that medical facilities at Qatar should have fallen into American hands, it is clear that there are no grounds on which we could object to the administration of the Dohar hospital by the Arabian Mission. 3. There will doubtless be room for considerable expansion of medical services in Qatar, and the possibility of establishing a small Agency dispensary or hospital there could perhaps be considered further when the time comes to appoint a resident Political Officer for this Shaikhdom.
