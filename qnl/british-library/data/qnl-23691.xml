Kulc, /or the grant oj additional leave to officer, or similar problems, or in order to undertake special courses of instruction. ihe following rules relate to study leave only. I hey are not intended to meet the case of officers (ieputed to other countries at the instance of Government, either for the performance of spe cial duties imposed on them or for the investiga tion of specific problems connected with their technical duties. Such eases will continue to he dealt with on their merits under the rules governing deputation. The rules apply, subject to the provisions of the Civil Services (Governors' Pro\ inces) Delegation Rules, 1926, to the Archaeo- logical Department, the Public Health and Medical ^ Besearch Departments (other than as regards officers of the Indian Medical Service, to whom special rules apply), the Bota nical Survey (including the officer? of the Royal Botainic Garden, Calcutta), the Civil Veterinary Department, the Factory Department, the Geo logical Survey, the Agricultural Department, the Meteorological Department, the Railway De partment (Traffic, Locomotive and Engineering Branches), the Telegraph Department, the Zoo- logical Survey, the Education Department, the Public Works Department, and the Forest Department (except in respect of continental tours to which special rules apply). The rules may be extended by the authorities empowered to sanction study leave under Rule 1-A to any officer including an officer of a Provincial Ser- vice, not belonging to any of the departments mentioned above, in whose case the sanctioning authority is of opinion that leave should be granted in the public interest to pursue a special course of study or investigation of a scientific or technical nature. ^ Note .—(The extension of these rules to the Public Works and Railway Departments does not affect the existing rule under which officers are allowed to visit engineering works when on leave in 5reat Britain.) 1. The powers granted by the^e Rules to the Government of India or to Local Governments may be delegated by them to the High Commis sioner for India, subject to any condition they may think fit to impose. 1A. Extra furlough for the purpose of etudy leave may be taken either in or outside ^ India. It may be granted to an officer of any of the Departments named aboVe by the Local Government or Administration under which he is serving, provided that when an officer borne permanently on the cadre of one province or department is serving temporarily in another province or department the grant of leave is subject to the conditions (a) that the sanctioning authority can make local arrange ments to carry on his work in his absence, and (b) that the sanetiofa of the province or depart ment to which he is permanently attached is obtained before leave is given. Studv leave should not ordinarily be granted to officers ot less ^han five years' service or to offieers within three years of ^he date at which they have the option of retiring, or, if they have the option of retiring after 20 years' service, withiii three years of the date at which they will complete 25 years' service: Nor should it be granted to officers who are about to retire on proportionate pension. Note .—Departments of the Government of India may grant Study Leave to officers under their administrative control, subject to thq restrictions which apply to the powers of a,' Local Government. 2. The grant of study leave should be made with due regard to the exigencies of the public service. In no case should the grant of this leave, in combination with any form of leave other than extraordinary leave or leave on medi cal certificate, involve an absence of over two years from an officer's regular duties, or exceed two years in the whole period of an officer's ser vice; nor should it be granted with such frequency as to remove him from contact with his regular work or to cause cadre difficulties owing to his absence on leave. A period of 12 months at one time should ordinarily be regard ed as a suitable maximum, and should not be exceeded save for exceptional reasons. 3. An officer whose study leave is combined with any other kind of leave should be required, to take his period of study leave at such a time as to retain, at its conclusion, a balance of other previously sanctioned leave sufficient to cover the period spent in returning to duty. 4. When an officer has been granted a definite period of study leave and finds subsequently that his course of study will fall short of the sanctioned period to any considerable extent, hi^ absence from duty should be reduced by the excess period of study leave unless he producep the assent of the sanctioning authority in India to his taking it as ordinary furlough. 5. Except as provided in rule G, all applica tions for study leave should be submitted with the audit officer's certificate to the Head of the Department through the prescribed channel, and the course or courses of study contemplated and any examination which a candidate proposes to undergo should be clearly specified therein. If the course of study is in Eutop^ or America, the Head of the Department should also for ward to the Secretary' to the High Commissioner for India, General Department, a copy of the approved programme of study. If it is not pos sible for the officer to give full details, as above, in his original application, or if, after leaving India, he wishes to make any changes in the programme which has been approved in India, he should su|rn4)&gt;it particulars as soon as possible to the Secretary to the High Commissioner for India, General Department. In such cases, he shoilld not, unless prepared to do so at his own risk, commence the course of study, nor incur any expenses in connection therewith, until he receives approval to the course through the High Commissioner.■XI &lt;■ 4 % 6. (a) Officers on furlough or other leave in Europe or America who wish to convert part of the leave into study leave or to undertake a course of study during leave, should, before commencing study and before incurring any expenses in connection therewith, submit a pro gramme of their proposed course of study to the Secretary to the High Commissioner for India, General Department. The programme should be accompanied by an official syllabus of the course, if one is available, and by any docu mentary evidence that the particular course, or examination has the approval of the authorities in India. In the absence of such evidence the programme may, if apprcyved by the High Com missioner, be proceeded with, but no study leave allowance will be admissible until the concur rence of the authority concerned in India is received. {h) Similarly officers on leave in the United Kingdom who desire to have it extended for pur poses of study under these Rules, should address the Secretary to the High Commissioner for India, but in addition to furnishing a statement of the proposed study they must support their applications with documentary evidence of their having obtained the approval of the authorities concerned in India to their applying for an extension of leave. They must also produce documentary evidence of the concurrence of the authority concerned in India to the grant of study leave and/or study allowance. 6A. No course of study will be recognised as qualifying for the grant of study allowance, or for study leave for any ether purpose, unless it has been approved in at least broad outline by the sanctioning authority in India in accordance with Rules 5 and 6 above, and unless, in cases where it has not been found possible to submit full particulars to the authorities in India, it has been approved in detail by the High Com missioner before it is begun. 7. A study allowance will be granted for the period spent in prosecuting a definite course of study at a recognised institution or in any de finite tour of inspection of any special class of work, as well as for the period covered by any examination at the end of the course of study. The rates as at present fixed are 128. a day in the United Kingdom, £1 a day on the continent of Europe and 30s. a day in the United States of America. These rates are liable to revision. The rate to be granted to officers who take study leave in other countries including India, will be specially considered by the Government of India or the Local Government in each case. In no case will subsistence allowance be granted in addition to study allowance and ordinarily travelling expenses will not be paid, but in ex ceptional cases claims will be considered on their merits by the Government of India or the Local Government. 8. Study allowance will be admissible up to 14 days for any period of vacation. At period during which an officer interrupts his course for his own convenience can not be considered as vacation. Study allowance may be given at the discretion of the Government of India or a Local Government for any period up to 14 days at one time during which the officer is prevented by sickness duly certified by a medical practitioner from pursuing the sanctioned- course of study. In the case of an officer retiring from the service without returning to duty after a period of study leave the study allowance will be forfeited. If the officer is under civil leave rules the study leave will be converted into furlough to the ex tent of the furlough standing to his credit at the date of retirement. Any balance of the period of study leave mentioned above which can not be so converted will be excluded in reckoning service for pension. 9. Officers granted study leave are ordinarily required to meet the cost of fees paid for courses of study. In exceptional cases the Government of India or the Local Government will be pre pared to consider proposals that such fees should be paid by Government. 10. On completion of a course of study a certi ficate on the proper form (which may be obtain ed from the High Commissioner), together with certificates of examinations passed or of special study, shall, when the study leave has been taken in Europe or America, be forwarded to the High Commissioner. When the study leave has been taken in any other country certificates of examinations passed or of special study, which should show the dates of commencement and termination of the course, with any remarks by the Instructor, shall be forwarded to the author ity which sanctioned the leave. In the case of a definite course of study at a recognised institu tion the study allowance will be payable by the High Commissioner or in India, as the case may be, on claims submitted by the officer from time to time, supported by proper certificates of at tendance. When the programme of study ap proved under rule 5 does not include or does not consist entirely of such a course of study, the officer shall submit to the High Commissioner or to the authority in India which sanctioned his leave, as the case may be, a diary showing how his time has been spent, and a report indi cating fully the nature of the methods and operations which have been studied and includ ing suggestions as to the possibility of applying such methods or operations to India. The sanc tioning authority in India will decide whether the diary and report show that the time of the officer has been properly employed, and will determine accordingly for what period the study allowance referred to in rule 7 may be granted. 11. Study leave will count as service for promotion and pension but not for furlough or any other leave. It will not affect any leave which may already be due to an officer; it will count as extra furlough, and will not be taken into account in reckoning the aggregate amount of furlough taken by the officer towards the maximum period admissible under the Civil Service Regulations. 12. During study leave an officer will draw half average salary as defined in Article 16, Civil Service Regulations subject to the maxima and minima laid down in Articles 316, 319, 326 and 327 ibid. The rate of exchange pres cribed by the Secretary of State in Council for the conversion of leave allowances shall apply to study leave allowances. An officer may, subject to the approval of the proper authorities being obtained as required by Rules 5 or 6, undertake or commence a course of study during privilege leave, and subject to Rules 7 and 8, draw study allowance in respect thereof, pro vided that study allowance is not drawn for an /-aggregate period exceeding two years during the whole of an officer's service. This rule applies to military officers in civil employment taking leave under the Civil Ser vice Regulations. 13. On an application for study leave in Europe or America being sanctioned by the Government of Madras, Bombay or Bengal, the Local Government should inform the High Com missioner of the particulars of the case. When such leave is sanctioned by any other Local Government or Administration, a report should be made to the Government of India who will inform the High Commissioner. It will be neces sary for the officer concerned to place himself in communication with the High Commissioner who will arrange any details and issue any letters of introduction that may be required. In all cases in which study leave in any other country is sanctioned the particulars should be reported to the Government of India. 1 ij ftlpd—862 FD— 15-1-30 -4,500. i t / ; I 4 ll ^.No. F. 52-R.
