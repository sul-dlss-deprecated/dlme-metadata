His contention is that none Indian Ocean, with a view to re- v vising the list of Dhow owners authorised to fly the French Flag. of them are authorised by international law. (?) Strict injunctions have been given to the Consuls and the Co lonial authorities not to renew the existing permits of navigation or to grant new ones except in cases where all is found to be perfectly regular. \ Any inquiries made oy French Consuls have been ex parte and based on the assumption that the practice in consti tutional and in Hons.Ottavi's case the only apparent form of inquiry adopted was the \ refusal to accept the papers of persons who wanted to re turn their licenses and flags to him. Their Consuls have been the sole judges of the 'perfect regularity' of the papers, the Su3 tan not having oeen consulted in any single caseFrench Ambassador's Memorandum. Comment of* 's Consul, Muscat. as to the adequacy of the grounds on which they have been issued. The only manner in which His High ness has been addressed on the subiect has consisted of verba] ^ menaces uttered oy the Jrench Con sul supported by French commanders during the presence of French men- of-war in Muscat, to the effect that if His Highness did not alter his present attitude with regard to the French Flag o.uestion genera lly, it would be the wors$ far him. An attempt was also made inciden- tally, and reported oy me at the time, to revive the question of Abdul Aziz, the French Dragoman;to all appearance simply with the view of provoking the Sultan to some action which would have been held to have given the French Consul, a pre text for using force;-which was in fact eventually threatened in writ- ting, with the Knowledge that i 1 the Sultan had to succumb in the one matter he would have to give way over the Flag question as well. (4) They in particular see that Article 38 and following Articles of the Brussels Act are ooserved. In the case of most of the French protected Article 32 and the following Ar ticles were dealt with at length in my report dated 18th June 1900 and numerous irregularities pointed in Para 7. thereof.French Ambassador's Memorandum. ooooy Comment of H.

The Sultan's contention is, with reference to clauses 1&amp;)3 of this Ar ticle that the persons who take flags are at the time of application to French Consulates neither 'suDjects' nor 'protected persons' under the Act and that French Consuls simply get hold of a Mus cat subject and allot him a plot of ground or take from him the price of a house in order to give him a flag. The homes of the flag- holders and their ances tors before them are in Oman and they live there and there only with their families for generations.

Comment of H.B.IK.'s ..Consul, Muscat/* (5) Nevertheless it has not yet been possible to complete the examination in all cases, as the operation is a^Lengthy one, in r view of the distance of many of the places and the constaJit movements of the Dhows. The operation need not be a 3engthy one at all in the case of Oman Dhows. So far as is known there is only one Omani French fla^holder re^ siding elsewhere than at Soor and the Dhows almost without exception arrive at Soor during May and 3 ie up high and dry for repairs in the creek there till after the monsoon when they start out again on the voyages. If the Su3tan were consulted he could assemble them all at 8 or weeks' notice any time during June July or August. m li ■■ (6) The Memorandum went on to describe the measures taken by the French Govern ment to insure that these Dhows do not engage in slave trade and stated that the most careful inquiries have failed to discover a single instance of such a thing. So far as Muscat is concerned the French Consul's inquiries have only been from the persons themselves interested namely the Flagholders and their comrades and it is not likely that they would put informa tion in his way, for no Mahornmedan will knowingly incriminate or hesi tate to shield another in the matter of slave dealing, which is no of fence according to their tenets. It is in any case naturally unlike ly that during the last years throughout which period the Flag- holders ha\/e been well aware that their title has been hanging in the oalance, they would be as activeooo i o /jr French Ambassador's Memorandum, Comment of H.B.M.'s Consul, Muscat. as usual in slave trading operations. I may here mention however that whereas the French Ambas sador informed Lord Salisoury that the R. F. 'Dromt/' was to be sent here 'to examine whe ther Dhows with French papers have been implicated in the slave tradeshe arrived at Soor at a season (late in Au gust) when all the Dhows,start outspick an span for their annual voyages; just the time in fact when any such exami nation would be ooviously use less and devoid of result. In the way of recent evidence regarding the traffic in slaves I can adduce the fol lowing. (a) The case mentioned by Sir Horace vValpole in the present correspondence, where in Sep tember 1896,' 2 Dhows flying the French Flag were seized by H.M.S.Sphinx and found to contain 200 negroes of whom the greater part must have been slaves. I note that the license of the Sala^ma was only ' pour j j aire la navigation sur le yi A- cote de Madagascar et iles avoisenants' whereas now they/ French Ambassador's Memorandum.

I also invite reference to the Resident's report No,76 dated 8th August 1896 regarding the importa tion of a large number of slaves into Shargah on the Pirate coast under the French Flag according to his information. (b) Since 1st April 1900 I have manu mitted 79 slaves, at this Consulate of whom, 49- r.ere unable to distinguish between one flag ahd another. 14- recognised flags and deposed that they had been brought from Africa in Dhows fjying the French flag. 3- F' .

GC011 Comment of H.B.M.'s Consul, Muscat. of explanation regarding specific names furnished. The names of the persons given by the Witnesses in these cases would simply be the names of the persons whom they had seen bring the Dhows back into port at Soor. Neither have I nor has the Sultan any authentic list of the names in which the French Licenses stand- The French if I am not mistaken profess to issue the licenses in the names of Captains of Dhows, out the men who give the Sul-n tan most trouble at Soor are the olier men, owners of Dhows,most of whom having be come affluent never go to sea but still by virtue of their owning Dhows flying the French flag they as well as their Captains and belongings claim as against the Sultan to be French protected sub jects. Thus although according to the French Ambassador ther&amp; are only 33 French Dhows there would be probably a double of Sooris with their /S families claiming French pro tection.French Ambassador's Memorandum, (7) A det/ailed account/ was ^ gather from 'this t.hat t.he French 'then given 01* 'the routes fol- claim 'bhat there are nov: Dhows Comment of H .B.M.'s Consul, Muscat. lowed by the Dhoi-vs in their belonging to Soor flying the French commercial operations.

Setting aside the question as to whether du ring the last two years French Dhows have or have not brought slaves,a m tter which cannot be conclusively proved one way or the other except by overhauling the Dhows with slaves on board,the fact re mains that the tribes at Soor have from time immemori al been a community of slave dealers;that the best ofthem habitually use slaves and that a civilised power by distributing flags among aich people simply encourages the whole community in lawless ness.

Lansdowhe's Government on 11th of August 1891 to the effect 'that the use .of the French Flag by sub jects of the Sultan can have no ef fect as against His Highness' and I did when occasion demanded as sure His Highness that the British Government having thus directed him he need have no iear whatever but that they and their represen tative at Muscat would support him in maintaining that position. I have never sought to encourage the Sultan to assert this position in any unconstitutional flray.. (14.) In June 1900,the Memo randum continued,immediately after the French Consul left Soor the Sultan of Muscat went there in the British gunboat 'Sphinx' accompanied by the British Consul. There are from 25 to 30 Hindoo Bri tish subjects residing at Soor for whose welfare the Political Agent at Muscat is respohsible. He in variably pays them a visit once a year at least,and the fact that there are a few French Flag -holders among the Arab population there af fords no reason why he should not visit the place when and as often as he finds it advisable just as much as any other part of the Sul- tan's territory. IfFrench Ambassador's Memorandum. Comment of H.B.M.'s Consul, Muscat. If he has not previously vi sited the port during the year the Political Agent's usual time for going there is just before the monsoon as all the chief men are then present,and in the pre sent instance the Sultan asked some time before that on the next occasion on which I or one of our men- of-war went down there,he might be al3 owed to take tho opportunity of travelling by her also. The words 'most violent, threats' are altogether un warranted and meaningless. The Sultan had never visited him the navigation papers delivered. Soor before and expected a sullen if not discourteous reception,but was pleasantly surprised. The ChieJ Zllclei s of all denominations came off to the 'Sphinx' to call upon him directly he arrived and took him off to the shore where they placed a house at his disposal. Two days later Abdulla oin Salim the Amir of the Beni Abu Ali (one of the two tribes in Soor) came in with nearly 1,000 (15.) As soon as he arrived at Soor the Sultan summoned the Dhow owners and with the most violent threats ordered them to give up to!!■ - 'iim 1 m k oi-jneiatj of H. B.

(18.) But this year he again went to Sur accompanied as before by the British Consul. The French Consul was there and probably his presence and the threats of the Arabs which made the Sultan leave Soor earlier than he had intended prevented Seyyid Feisal from making a fresh attempt to intimidate the French proteges. This is a mis-statement. The British Consul started for Kalhat and Rufseh in company with a Government of India geological expert to examine coal deposits. The Sultan came down 5 weeks later at the urgent request of the British Consul and to get him out of difficulties. As soon as the geologist's work was finished the Sultan returned with us to Muscat. The intrigues of the French Consul at Soor at this time were the main source of our difficulties and the Sultan was both aroused and incens ed by what he heard while in the vicinity of Soor,but it was never his intention to take any special action at this time with reference to the Flag question.

(24.) In order no doubt to give more weight to hia threats the Sul tan increased to 100 men the garri son of the fort of Sur which numbers 30. (85.) The notables of Sur did not allow themselves to be intimida ted and once again the efforts of the Sultan to infringe the rights of France were ineffectual. (86.) The memorandum in conclu sion expressed the opinion that ai- ter these two failures Seyyifl J 1 ei- sal will leave the French proteges in peace if the British Agent al lows it.

This increase in the garri son was in response to an ap peal from his Wali at Soor who complained that with his present garrison he was not able to enforce his authority even in the most trivial mat ters . It is difficult to see how the Sultan can be held to be infringing the rights of France either by increasing a garrison or building a wall anywhere in his own territory As to the value of this im plied threat it is not for me to offer remarks but I beg again to point out that Here as in fact throughout his whole memorandum Mons.Carrion begs the whole question at is sue, namely whether these flag holders are or are not prote ges at all according to m- ternationalFrench Ambassador's Memorandum.

In the first place his Vazier, Seyyid Mahomed bin Azzan,was given a salute of 11 guns -a compliment which has not hither to been usual- and when the Sultan visited the Cruiser she 'dressed ship' for him , an honour which^believe H.M.Ships only pay to members oi our own Royal Family. 4# T he Sultan's official letter is temperate and' dig nified,but he expressed himself very strongly to me at a per sonal interview. I feel however that I have nothing to add to what I have already written oh the subject,ani can only now anxiously await a sigh from His Majesty's Government.. 5.

After the usual compliments. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your esteemed letter dated 11th Shawwal in which was intimated your re- quest to be informed precisely in writing,according to your own words, as to what is the ,f present state of things' which the Great French Government c.aims to maintain. The answer is this;it is not my Great Government which is arrogating any claim,it is you who are asserting a claim against her; and the present state of things -which you were plainly in formed that the French Government intended to maintain^vide my letter of 14th January- is precisely that position which it is now claimed (by you) to alter,that is to say the sta tus of . ubjects under our protection from of old;whose sta tus is that which Your Highness spoke of in your letter da ted 9th Shaaban,and with regard' to which His Excellency our Minister Monsieur Delcasse replied to the effect communicated to you in my letter to which you refer. There is no doubt or uncertainty about this matter but there 4s nevertheless no harm if fresh emphasis is laid,as occasion requires.on the fact that the Great French Government does not agree with your claim above mentioned and does not admit it, any part of it. On the contrary my Government has the firm est intention to maintain the above mentioned irrevocable - state of things; that is to say the maintenance of our sub jects above mentioned under our Jurisdiction, and the preser vation of the diginity of our -flag which from old time your noble ancestors have honoured and respected.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No.64 dated 1st instant I have the honour to report that His High ness the Sultan called on me this morning to make a com munication which I beg to record in detail. He left it to me to take whatever action I thought the circumstan- es called for. (.2.) As mentioned in Para. ?5. of my letter above quoted, during the official visits which were exchanged between the Sultan and the French Commodore no allusion whatever was made to the Flag question, and I particular ly warned His Highness, in view of what happened last year, on no account to accede to any subsequent request for a private interview- advice which he undertook to follow. Yesterday by arrangement. Commodore Kiesel accompa nied by his Flag Commander, Flag Lieutenant, and Mon sieur Ijaronce, called to take leave prior to the depar ture of the 'Catihat' for the Persian Gulf. The visit was a non-ceremonial one- Monsieur Laronce being in plain clothes and the Naval Officers in white undress uniform- and on such occasions the Sultan generally receives visitors in his private apartments. In the present case however, in order to obviate any attempt at private conversation, Seyyid Feisal conducted the party to his puolic Duroar room where his usual suite were present.As t,he Sult/an was ushering them into the room Monsieur Iiaronce dropped behind the otliers and told the Sultan in an undertone that the Commodore wished to see him in private, Seyyi i 'eisal replied, passing in to the room at the same moment, that he feared that this was not possible under the circumstances, as there were so many people about. After exchanging compliments Commodore Kiese] with the French Consul for his interpreter observed that he hoped there would always oe concord oetween His Highness and the French Government ' r and then at once oroached the question o ' the Soori proteges and said that he wished to discuss the subject and to press the main- said that tenance of the existing order of things. The Sultan^he had written all he had to say on that point; that it was inconvenient to discuss the matter now, and that if they had anything fresh to put forward he begged that they would represent it in writing. The Commodore rejoined that they would not write. The Sultan made no reply to this but introduced a fresh topic and evaded further conversation on the subject of the flags until they took their departure. (.3.) His Highness assured me that nothing fell from him of which they could possibly make capital, and that his brother and the Vazier were witnesses of this, but that to make quite sure that the French did not repeat their tactics of last year and put words into his mouth which he had never spoken, he hastened to communicate what passed to me, for purposes of record. (.4.) Not having received any comrnunination from the Government of India since despatch of my telegram of 3rd January to your address and being in complete uncertainty as to the ultimate inten tions of His Majesty's Government in regard to the Flag question ^ it was a matter of some difficulty to me to decide whether or not to address a communication to the French Consu] oefore the Catinat left, protesting, as from myself, under the Declaration of 1862, against the assertion of the claim contained in his letter of 23rd January to the Sultan and now taken up by Commodore Kiese]. I feared that my refraining from doing so might in any case assist the French pretension and encourage them to further assert themselves On the other hand if I addressed a protest in which I must neces- sarilynecessarily quote 'the Sultan, it would be embroiling him with the French to an unfair extent if His Majesty's Government do not intend to stand by the dictum of 1891. Moreover it seemed possible that the French Commodore and Consul, who have been in frequent telegraphic commu nication with Monsieur Delcasse, might oe acting on some concession already ootained from His Majesty's Govern ment of which information has not yet reached me. Under the above circumstances and in the hope that the negociations in progress between our two Governments will be held to have already gone too far to oe upset or vitiated by any present action or inaction on the part of their agents on the spot I decided to do nothing in the presence of the Catinat pending instructions from nxrf Government and trust that the Sultan's case will be A prejudiced thereby. The ,, Catinat' has just left for the Persian Oulf intending to return on 27th. (.5.) While I have no desire to magnify difficulties, the Government of India will perhaps believe that with the Sultan no longer able to see ahead and leaving him self entirely in my hands, my present position as well as his is somewhat anxious and delicate and I therefore earnestly hope that the decision of His Majesty's Govern ment as to whether they can or cannot support His High ness may not be much longer ielayed.

Sir, I have the honour to intimate that His Highness the Sultan of Muscat informs me that notwith standing repeated protests, both verbal and written, which he has addressed to yourself or your predecessor in time past, you have nevertheless recently, in offi cial communications dated 14th and 23rd January 1902 PQgpeQ-^ively, formulated on behali ot the trench Goveih- ment a claim to exercise jurisdiction in Muscat terri tory and territorial waters over certain born and domi ciled Omani subjects of His Highness, to whom French Flags and ' Titres de Navigation ' have been issued by Consular officials of your Government - and further that Commodore Kiesel, commanding the R.F.Cruiser ' Catinat sought to press the aforesaid claim, when visiting His Highness in your company on 6th instant. in this connection the Sultan holds the emphatic opinion that the assertion of such a claim by the French Repub lic is altogether incompatible with his independence as a Sovereign Ruler; and commends this aspect of the ques tion to my attention by the light ol existing neaty enaggements. I entirely concur in the view expresse 1 by His High ness in this regard and it is therefore incumbent upone, under the Declaration of 10th March 1862 (by which pective Governments engaged to respect the independence of the Sultan of Muscat) - to protest against the assertion of such a clax.a by Government of the Republic, and. further, to maintain that the exercise of any direct or indirect act ox jurisdiction prosecution thereof would oe a violation of the Declaration aoove quoted.

Sir, In acknowledging the receipt of your com munication of yesterday's date, I am constrained to obser ve that if, as I think I am right in believing, you seek to interpret the expression ' status quo ' mentioned in your letter, in terms which involve or suggest a right on the part of the Government of the Republic to exercise, within the territory or territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat, any measure whatever of Jurisdiction over born and domiciled subjects of His Highness, such an interpre tation cannot but be regarded as a purely ex parte one, with regard to which the Sultan has not been consulted; which he has never accepted; and against any suggestion of which, as he has informed His Majesty's Crovernment, he has repeatedly protested. Such an interpretation would in fact be fundamentally inconsistent with the Independence of the Sultan, and opposed to the terms of the Declaration of 1862 and to the first principles of the Law of Nations. It is therefore my duty hereoy to challenge it. w I have the honour To, Monsieur P..

(.2.) His Highness the Sultan is much relieved at the knowledge that the protest has been addressed; but is at the same time a little apprehensive that the 'Catinat' when she returns on 26th or 27th instant may take some assertive action. I do not myself see that Commodore Kiesel could well do anything at all under the present circumstances and H.M.'s S.Lapwing one of the small gunboats is still here but if there is no immediate urgency in the Peisian Gulf it would be a source of strength to the Sultan if one of the larger vessels i.e. H .M.

From, To, Major P.Z.COX, H.B.M.'s Consul &amp; Political Agent, Muscat. H.S.Barnes Esquire, C.S.I. I.C.S. Secretary to the Government of India Foreign Department Calcutta. Dated Muscat March 7th 1902. Sir, In continuation of my telegram to your ad dress dated 4th instant I have the honour to make the fol lowing further report. (.2.) Had I gone to Soor as I suggested it would have been necessary for me to leave Muscat on the night of 5th instant. Up to the hour on that day however at'which it was necessary for me to let the Commander of H.M.^ S. 'Fox' know for certain regarding my departure in order to enable him to get up steam, the Foreign Department's reply to my telegram had not arrived - (it reached me on the following day) ; and while, as stated, it seemed to me that if Mons Laronce, after what had passed between, us, proceeded to Soor without giving me personally some friendly assurance a,s to his harmless intentions, he could hardly be surpri sed at my suspecting his motives and proceeding there too, I was anxious at the same time to avoid that course, as being likely to appear aggressive. / In order therefore to give my colleague an opening for a reassuring communication should he care to avail himseli of it, I addressed him a lettei;No. 118 of 5th March, of which a copy is submitted (enclosure No.l); and I trust that the terms of it will be considered unobjectionable. Enclosure No.2 is Monsieur Laronce's reply, from which it will be noted that he tacitly admits the statement attri buteda attributed to him by the Sultan; and at any rate liiuitfc the French claim to those rights of police and surveillance only which according to him the Brussels Act entitles him to exerciLo. (.3.) While thesr^ recorded admissions on his part are doubtless useful as reducing the scope of the issues involve ., I trust it will hot be considered that they in any way satisfy the requirements of the case. The object still is to obtain an examination^anu written expla nation of the grounds on which each flag has been given; it v.ill then be time to define the na/ture and extent of the police sur- ' veillance which is provided for in such cases oy the Brussels Act. (.4.) As between the Sultan of Muscat and his Soori subjects the statement made to His Highness on 4th instant even if honestly carried out by the French Consul, who is now at Soor, will have no practical effect unless and until the fact that they are unuer the absolute jurisdiction of the Sultan while in his territory, is made plain to the flagholders in an unmistakeable manner, and as it is desirable that there should oe as little delay over this as that,subject possible, the Sultan suggests to the approval of aovornment, he should issue a general Notification informing the Sooris and his community generally that whereas certain of his subjects have directly or indirectly claimed exemption from his jurisdiction by virtue of their holding Foreign flags, the public is hereoy informed that, as the result of an exchange of communications on the subject between himself and the Governmentspi Great Britain .and France it has been definitely and finally decided that in Muscat territory the rights and obligations oi the holders oj. Foreign flags differ in no wise from those of the rest oj his subjects, (.5.) In conclusion I venture to make a further suggestion for consideration; That in view of the partial admissions now made by the French Consul, and without prejudice to the result or the examination of each individual case, subsequently to be pressed for. His Highness r-hould address an official communication to j ions lour Lc^ron-^ stating with regard to the claim of the French Government to police the Dhows, that it would be more convenient and agreeable to00068 y to himself* instead of spending a month annually among His Highness's subjects at Soor - (a proceeding which he found tended to put wrong ideas into the heads of his subjects] French Consuls would be good enough to inspect the papers etc., of Dhows flying their flag at sea, at the Sultan's capital of Muscat, and that to this end His High ness would oe glad to give him the necessary help in get ting the Dhows to call here. It is during these a,nnual sojourns in the midst^of the Soori camp that the seeds are sown vvhich have done so much to undemine the Sultan's authority there. Such visits, at all events in Monsieur Ottavi's case, were carried out with no honest motive - and they rather assist slhtve trading operations than otherwise, for French Dhows intending to import slaves have only to land them and their gear at Lashkareh or Ras-eHioad, and then, after washing their craft, come on to Soor where they are board ed by the French Dragoman Abdul Aziz and reported 'in order' on the strength of which it is possible for the French Consul to send a satisfactory report to the Internatioal Bureau at Zanzibar. If these visits could be obviated it would be a great advantage and even if the Sultan's request were not com plied 'with it would at all events let the French Govern ment know the light in which they are regarded. I should notjinyself think of making any lengthened stay at any port or tov/n in the Sultan's territory without His Highness's concurrence, and such a request as that sug gested above would seem to be quite a natural and reason able one for him to prefer, I trust therefore that I may be permitted to advise him accordingly.

S ir, '10 0083 T he French Ambassador spoke to me to-day on the subject of the difficul ties which had arisen in connection with certain Muscat dhows which had been in the habit of flying the French flag. The matter had, His Excellency said, been very thoroughly investigated by the French naval authorities on the spot. T hey had taken measures to satisfy themselves as to the right of the dhows to fly the French flag, and no new papers would be issued, so that the difficulty was one which would disappear automati cally in time. The result of the local inquiry had, moreover, been to establish that there was no traffic in slaves, as we had alleged, between Muscat and bar. —Tfie Snllari'was, htfWCrer; mdmvttvgitre-Tf6U^;m5:nly. Ills Excellency said, because he believed he had our support. His Excellency begged me to believe that sufficient precautions had been taken to prevent any^abuse of the right to fly the French flag in these waters, but he felt sure that I would under stand that the withdrawal of that right in the case of vessels which already pos sessed it and whose papers were in order was out of the question. M. Cambon requested me to regard this communication as informal; he offered it in the hope that his explanation might avoid the recurrence of the diffi culties which had arisen on former occasions.

Owing to the constant employment of the vesse's on the Peis'an Gulf division on political and other duties, no oppcrtunity has occurred of systemaii* cally patrolling the coast on that division. .3.

TMR French Ambassndor made to mc to-day a communication to the follow- ing effect, which he especial y desired me to regard as unolHfial, as to the right of Mascat dhows 10 lly the French flag.4 1 The Suri Dhows may be divided into two groups according to the regions in which they carry on their commercial operations. Those belonging to the first group convey from Suri to Bombay the dates produced in the provinces of Jaolan and Sharkiyeh, and bring back cargoes of Indian rice. They also biing from the Malabar Coast the wood used in build ing the Oman dhows. The dhows of the second and most numerous group trade outside Oman. They leave Sur in September and October for Mohammeraand Basra, where they buy dates, which they take to the Hadramant Coast, to Aden, to the Coast of Yemen, to the Somali Coast or to the Benadir Coast. They then go to the East Coast of Africa stopping at Mombassa, Malindi, etc. Some of them go as tar as Zanzibar, the Comoro Islands, and Madagascar. The number of these latter is, however, decreasing, principally in consequence of the development of the steamer lines. At the beginning of the south west monsoon all the dhows return to Sur, some of them bringing cargoes of beams, which they obtain on the East Coost of Africa, and which are used for building purposes in Oman, etc. The remainder, who are the majority, bring supplies of grain from East Africa to the Benadir Coast, the Somali Coast, Sheho and Makelleh, and the Hadramant Coast. All these dhows return to Sur, generally without cargoes, after making large profits, as they are not merely carriers but real merchants who buy and sell goods themselves. In order to ascertain whether in spite of the usual watch kept by the French Consular and naval authorities the dhows flying the French flag engage in the slave trade, two ships of war were during last season specially charged with the duty of watching their operations. One of these, the ' Scorpion ' examined them a: Zanzibar, and the other the ' Infernet ' on their arrival at Sur. The officers searched every dhow, but did not discover a single case of slave trading, or a single fact justifying a presumption that any of them had been engaged in the slave trade. « It was ascertained on that occasion that two-thirds of the dhows holding French certificates that arrived M Sur had ccme from Bombay, Aden or Shehr and Mekelleh, where they could not have obtained slaves. Of the other third (i i altogether) eight had touched at Mombassa, Milindi, etc., where a most care ful watch is kept ; the three remaining dhows had come direct from Zanzibar and might a priori have aroused suspicion ; but there proved to be no ground for sus pecting them. The French Government consider that the above facts disposed of the charges made against the dhows flying the French flag, and that this would sur prise no one who knew how careful the French Consuls were in examining the certificates. The French Consuls had, moreover, been engaged for some time in carefully revising all these papers. The work w r as nearly finished, and no new certificates would be granted. In these circumstances there was no reason for withdrawing French protec tion from the Oman dhow owners, and the French Government could not allow them to be interfered with by the Sultan of Mascat in the exercise of their legiti mate trade. M. Cambon added that he was under the impression that the Sultan's atti tude was attributable lo the fact that be regarded himself as to some extent the protege of His Majesty's Government. - ■ • - • I am, etc., (Signed) Omitted.5 India Office. 2$th March igo2.

In reply, I am to request that you will lay befor© Lord Lansdowno tho en- 1. L. No. 14 Secret and enclosures. closed copy of a letter from th0 Govern- . , ment of India, which forwards, amongst other papers, Captain Cox s comments on M. Cambon's communication to Lord Lansdowne of the 14th August last. The French Ambassdor's communication of the 12th March is substantially similar, so far as it goes, to that of the 14th August, and, with respect to His Excellency s ciccount of the movements of the dhows and his contention that the charges made against them of slave dealing are completely disposed of, I am to refer you to Captain Cox's comments, Nos. 6 to 8, 10 and 11. It appears to Lord Georg0 Hamilton that not only do the known facts of the cases of the ' Sadu ' and the ' Salama ' in 1896 tend to invalidate M Cambon's contention ; but also the details furnished by Captain Cox in his report of the 18th August 1900, and further details supplied in his present report show that the dhows find means of evading examination by the French vessels of war. It will further be seen that the Government of India do not admit the accuracy of M. Cambon s account of the Sultan's visit to Sur in June 1900. The question, however, which appears to the Government of India to be of Enclosure in Secretary', letter No p-M.. ^ i™ 51 , P r f Ssin g importance is that of . . . ... the r rench claim to full jurisdiction over their tiag-nolders in Muscat waters, which formed the subject of mv letter to you of the 5th February last. It appears from papers received from India (forwarded herewith) that Captain Cox, on receiving authority from His Majesty's Govern ment, addressed a protest to the French Consul under the Anglo-French De claration of 1862. M. Laronce. in his reply, states th^t he has claimed nothing bat the maintenance of the status quo in respect of jurisdiction. The facts relating to this question are summed up in a memorandum which forms the 14th enclosure to the Government of India letter now forwarded It shows that ever since 1894 the present Sultan has protested against any assertion of French protection over his subjects ; and that in any cases in which the French Consul has taken action, his interference has been contra*y to the Sultan's will. It will further be seen that in three of these cases the orlinary jurisdiction of the Sultan was concerned, two of the cases being connected with the slave trade and in the third the possession of the French certificate beiig itself in question. The re maining case was a suit between a British Indian rader and French protege, and the British Consul expressly reserved the qustion of the right of the French Government to exercise jurisdiction. Turning now r to the despatch to Sir E. Moreon, No. 104, dated 12th March I am to observe that the Secretary of State for lidia notes with satisfaction the assurance given by M. Cambon that ' no new certificates would be granted '. It is presumed that this assurance confirms tha; previously given to Lord Salis bury by^ M. Cambon on 26th June 1900, and tiat no certificates will be recog nised which may have been granted for the first time at a date subsequent to the 26th June 1900. On this understanding, tie points at issue are confine^ to the certificates granted before the 26th June ipo, and to the effect of those certificates. l am to suggest that, if possible, 1 list of these certificate-holders should be obtained, as it is of^the utmost imporance to learn the extent to which this torni of French protection has been caried. I am to observe thr.t our■ - Treaty engagements regarding Muscat seem to justify a protest on ou part against action by France which is not compatible with the independence o tie Sultan, The French claims in this respect formed the object of my Mter o the 5th February 1902, and to the views then expressed Lord George Har 1 ton adheres.

SIR, I have the honour to report that on ray return to Muscat recently after some weeks' absence I learnt that while I was in the interior a report had appeared in the newspapers, in the form of a telegram from Mozambique dated on or about 19th March, to the elfect that a Portuguese man—of—war after a sharp fight with a llotilla ol 'Muscati*' slave Dhows, had captured 12 Dhows and rescued 700 slaves, and had during the con flict accounted for about 200 Arabs in killed and prisoners. ^ visited Soor this day in H.M.S.'Amphitrite' and while there made inquiries in connection with the above report with the following result. About S weeks ago when the news first reached Soor there was general wailing and mourning on the part of the women in nearly every house in the place,' Since then further details have been received and according to the information given to me, there are at present 155 men absent from Soor who ought to have returned before this who are believed to have been among those killed or capturedcaptured by the Portuguese of these 17 are known to have been killed and of the total 6 or 7 are alleged French Proteges without doubt. The Jennebeh and the Abu Ali Shaikhs however only admit 3 killed, have stopped all individual mourning and the subject is generally avoided by them. (.3.) They have obviously good reason, as have the French Tor preventing the disclosure of details and names of killed and captured and while expressing the opinion that if, as seems cer tain, the report seen in the papers is at all events founded on fact, the incident will considerably strengthen our position and arguments in realtion to the French Flag question, I have the honour to suggest that an endeavour should be made before it is too late to obtain from the Portuguese Government full details of the occurrence including the names, fathers' names and tribes of those killed and captured.

SIR, I have the honor to report in confirmation of my telegram of June 9th that H.M.S.'Amphitrite' -Captain C.Win dham C.V.O.- arrived at Muscat on 8th idem having caviled at Dhofar, Kurria Murria and Madraka on her way from Aden, 2. On 9th instant I accompanied Captain Windham on his official visit to the Sultan at which several of the Am- phitrite's officers were also present,and on the following morning His Highness returned the visit on board, an was accompanied not only by his usual suite but by a large num ber of his friends. After the usual formalities had been exchanged with the Sultan the 'Amphitrite' got up steam and the party was taken outside the harbour to witness some hea vy gun practice by which they expressed themselves much im- pressed and interested, 3 . About two hours later,as soon as the Sultan an his followers had disembarked,the former under the usual sa lute, the 'Amphitrite' started on her cruise,and at Captain Windham's express wish,and availing myself of the authority given me in Foreign Department telegram dated Viceroy's Camp 50th AprilSSSSf : % i.' 30th April, I accompanied him wit/hoirt rurther reference t,o Governmenti. Having first shewn the Flag to the south of Muscat,as far as Soor where we anchored for a few hours to enable me to do some busi ness on shore,we returned to Muscat to pick up the English mail and then proceeded northwards. Calls were made at Seeb and Bir- ka on the Eatineh coast in order to reassure British subjects residing in those ports,rumours having for some time been cur rent, pointing to the probability of a Bedouin raid in that neighbourhood, after which the 'Amphitrite' shaped course for Bunder Abbas. During 24 hours of our stay there visits were exchanged with the Deputy Governor, and I took the opportunity of visiting the late Captain j ioxer's gravo. From Bunder Abbas it had been intended to visit Bahrein,but H,M, S. 'Amphi trite' had not received the chart oi Jlahrein watexs recently made by the ' Invest igator', and, according to the c-art supplied to her,I understand that she would have had to lie so far out as to defeat the object of her visit, so jJahrem was cut out of her programme, and,after steaming round Henjam Is land we next touched at Bushire and then at Koweit ,vv lere t ; usual formalities were gone through. Shaikh Mubarak himself was absent in a summer resort,some hours journey from the tovm, so we did not see him,but exchanged visits with his son,Shaikh Jabbar,who received us very cordially. 4^ oh the return journey the 'Amphitrite' after cros- sing the Pearl Bank waters and anchoring for the nig^t within sight of A1 Bida,picked up the Pirate Coast the following morn ing a little north of Ras el Ehaima. Prom thence Captain Win dham hugged the coast of the Roos -el-Jebbel promontory and passing through the narrow passage between Mussendam Island and the mainland, anchored for the night off the village of al Badi, near IChor Pakan. The following morning after spending a few hours on shore at al Badi and Khor Pakan we passed down the Batmoh Goa.st to cat arriving at^on the 25th instant after a' fortnight's absence. HavingHaving taken a Tew tons of coal H.M.S.'Amphitrite' left on 26t/ f i inst,ant for Bombay, 5, H:L ' 2 Ship in question has visited these wator^p-t a time when the climate has, I fear, been the cause o^ a goo- aoal of distress to the Ship's Company, fresh as it is from a cold English Spring,but from a local point of view Gov vrnmont may rest assured that the 'Amphitrite's' visit has been productive of much good and her Commander, Captain Windham,who thoroughly appreciated the object of his mis- possible si on, lain himself out in everyday, by hospitality to visi tors, by throwing his ship open to sight-seors and by the liDo^al exercise of the search light,to impress the natives and make his cruise productive. ^ — exporiment could be repeated once a year during the winter,it would,I venture to suggest,be an excellent measure.

No. 1755-E.A., dated Simla, the 28th August 1902. From—The Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To— M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E,, Political Agent at Maskat. When you were in Simla last month, you enquired whether any objection could be raised to the issue of an order by the Sultan to the effect that the acquisition of property in Maskat by foreign subjects will not be recognised unless it is registered by the Sultan (or by the officer deputed by him) before the transfer of the property takes place. You observed that, if such an order were issued, the Sultan would know beforehand when the transfer of any sacred or religious property was contemplated, and might take steps accordingly, e.g, in the case of foreclosure on a mortgage he could pay off the mort^a^e him self, if he so desired. You also enquired whether, with a view to prevent the sale by British Indian traders of houses or other property to French or Russian purchasers, it would be possible for you, as British Consul, to issue an order to the effect that sales of immoveable property in Maskat by British subjects will not be recog nised unless registered in the British Consular Court before the actual transfer. 2. In reply to your enquiries, I am directed to convey the following instructions:— With respect to the first proposal, it is clear that Article 5 of the Treaty of 1891 with Maskat does not supersede the ordinary rule of private international law, under which transfer of immoveable property is governed by the lex loci. It merely permits British subjects to acquire or alienate property by any mode legally open to the Sul tan's subjects. There is no objection to the issue by the Sultan of a law requiring registration for the purpose of giving him notice of the contemplated acquisition of property by foreigners. It is not, however, clear from the terms of your reference whether the precise effect of the proposed order has been properly understood. It is not known what the local law in Maskat as to the alienation of wahf property may be; but, assuming it to be the same as in India, the issue of the proposed order would not, it is considered, enable the money-lender to sell up any such property which is not alien able at present. On the other hand, if the local law permits the alienation of wakf property, and if the Sultan sees a pious duty in saving such property from passing to others than Muhammadans, the issue of the proposed order will no doubt give him an oppor tunity of performing that duty. 3. As regards the second question, it is not clear by what authority a dis pute between a British subject on the one part and a French or Jiussian subject on the other is decided. By Article 13 of the Treaty of 1891, the Sultan has divested himself of jurisdiction; but by Article 6 of the Order in Council, dated the 4th November 1867, His Britannic Majesty's Consul is invested with jurisdiction only in disputes arising between British subjects. If the idea is simply to de6ne the limits of diplomatic redress, there is no objection to your declaring that you will not exert yourself in the case of any transfer to any subject of any other Christian State, unless such transfer has, previously to its completion, been notified to you. Furthermore, under Article 1 of the same Order, you might frame a rule for the peace, order and good government of His Majesty's subjects, prohibiting 563 F. D .-S E—C3-64— Sept.2/1 Acquisition of property in Maskat by foreigaers. them, under penalty of fine, from transferring property without registration and could give some effect to such a rule by declining to recognise such a transfer in the exercise of your jurisdiction under article 6. It would not however, be permissible for you to refuse, in the terms proposed, to recognise the transfer in any dispute in which the French or Russian transferee was 'con cerned. You could not, for example, sell a building, which had been so trans ferred, in execution of a decree against the British transferer, or insist on administering it for the benefit of his legal representatives. In such cases you would be bound to recognise the transfer, unless the French or Russian authorities could be induced to enforce a similar rule for their own subjects.

' -'4 ' \|V\i i Eaet Africa to Soor and tlis vicinity; in which direction tha Arabian and Persian Gulf Markats look for tha ragular supply of slavse. I hava not parsavar^d in thie opinion without strong grounds. In tha first placa a snccassion of incidants connactad with Soor 9 for instance two expeditions for the examination of Coal \ Oaposits; robberies occurring among British subjects residing there; and cooperation with the Sultan in matters of administra tion, havo necessitated my being a frequent visitor to the port and I have therefore had much better Opportunities than any of my predecessors for acquainting myself with its people and politics and with events passing there. Furthermore during the last 3 years I have travelled extensively in the interior of Oman.in cluding a recent and lengthy journey from Abu Thabi to Muscat; and though,in the course of my travels,! have never seen slaves working in gangs on the American principle, as the Revd Mr Zwemor once informed ma he had recently done, I have nevertheless seen enough to assure myself that the country is profusely sprinkled with negroes and that the supply from Soor and the neighbour hood is regular - and this conviction is coroborated by the fact that the number of slaves that present themselves at this Consulate to claim freedom shows no signs of falling off. he recent conflict (dealt with in separate correspondence) betwean a fleet of Oman slaveChows and a Portuguese man-of-war near Simuku,south of Mozambique^in which 120 or more Oman Arabs'were taken prisoners by the latter and many killed, affords furthSr and fresh evidence in support of my contention and throws light on the modus operandi of the Arabs. Again-more recently still the Soori Dhows have been detected running arms for the rebel Mullah in Somali Land. uhink I have said enough to warrant the conclusion that at whe present moment the reputation of Soor is as deservedly evil as it can well be. 4. Adverting now to the attitude of His Highness the SultanSultan towards the slave trade, it may, according to my ex- ? • i ■ . * j perience, be regarded as bearing two somewhat conflicting aspects; (1) A loyal wish to fulfil his obligations in the direction of cooperating with the Political Agent in the grant of freedom papers wherever possible to r f negroes who apply at this Consulate for them, (2) Inability hitherto to take any effective stens himself to stop the annual importation which goes on and no great inclination perhaps to set his face against and discountenance the status of slaves generally in his dominions. Under the first head I should like to emphasize the fact that though in nearly every case of a slave escaping from the interior to this Consulate the owners endeavour to concoct a case before the Local Government for restitution, I have always found the Sultan willing to listen to reason and to act up to his obligations in such matters in spite of the odium which he often brings upon himself for so doing. Under the second head I would repeat that slavery has been a recognized status among the Oman community from time immemo rial^ that the Sultan r s mother herself was a slave originally, and that as a rule slaves are very well treated; v/ith excep tion of the pearl diving section of them who no doubt lead a life of considerable privation, 5* As a matter of fact the present Sultan has hitherto been m a great measure powerless to do much to stop the in- 4 gress of newly captured negroes, and at any rate during the time that the question of the French Flag has been in process of negociation between His Highness and the French Government it would have been unadvisable to put upon him any Special pressure in this connection; but I venture to submit that the recent purchase of a steamer for him affords a convenient and fittingfitting opportunity for tho addroas to His Highnosp of a on strong axhortationon thp subjoct of Soor; its connoction /\ ^ith th^ trado in arms and slavos, and his own position in regard th-^roto. In this connection while I quite realize that the views of yourself and the Government of India may not improbably differ from mine as to the terms in which such communication might usefully be couched, I venture nevertheless to submit, with some deference, a draft on the lines which I should myself feel inclined to recommend, and to suggest that the subject is ol sufficient importance to warrant the communication 'being addressed as from the Government of India to the Sultan direct, a: forwarded to you for transmission with a forwarding letter as in the case of a Kharita. b^siaes au.u.ing weight to the letter would strengthe your hands and mine. a r r oir.ce coming to Muscat I have spared no pains to bring the S^u.tan to a sense of his own dignity and responsibility in -ealing with Soor and to give him all the assistance that, I unob jac -ionably couj .- in strenghtening his authority there by conswutior.a^ methods.

The arrival at Muscat of the steamer purchased by Your Highness seems to be a fitting occasion for us to address you this communication on the subject of the proper and effective control of the outlying ports of your territory and with special reference to your Treaty obligations in regard to the Slave Trade. It had been the confident hope of the British Government that, this traffic in human beings was steadily on the decline, but it is now clear to us from the reports submitted by our Naval and Consular Officers that it still thrives to an unfortunate degree; and while we fully appreciate the loyal manner in which Your Highness cooperates with our representative at Muscat in the grant of manumission papers to those negroes who escape to the British Consulate and are entitled to freedom under Treaty, yet the difficult question of the annual shipr ments of slaves, captured on the African littoral, to ports in your territory and in craft belonging to your subjects still remains to be dealt with - a question which does not seem ever to have been resolutely faced by Your Highness. According to information at our disposal it appears that al most all the Dhows engaged in this traffic hail from ports on the Southern Coast of Oman, and specially from Soor - and while within the last few years we have not addressed any special representation to Your Highness in this connection, familiar as we are with the difficulties you have had in exercising effective authority over that portion of your ter ritory, yet incidents have recently come to our knowledge whichp*&gt; Triiich make it incumbent upon ue to draw your eerioue attention to the subject, T..:- a- ■■■ 5' f •-j* .-i • i '-y Within the last few montlis information has been received by us and has no doubt reached Your Highness also, that a powerful gang of Arab slave-dealers has been captured by a Portuguese man-of-war on the Mozambique Coast, after a severe fight in which several persons were killed on both sides, 12 of the Dhows burnt, and some 120 of the Arabs made prisoners by the Portuguese. It is understood that these Dhows belong to Oman and that the Arabs are nearly all subjects of Your Highness, chiefly Sooris. No further evidence than this can be required to convince us and yourself than that there exists at Soor a regular and wide spread organization for the capture and shipment of negroes from the African Coast. furthermore, these same Sooris, or their fellows, seem now to hav^ embarked also upon the smuggling of arms, for we learn that with in the last few months our Men-of-war, cruising in Aden Waters, have captured a Dhow or Dhows manned by your subjects, in the act of smuggling arms and ammunition across to the Somali Coast for ths use of the :vlullah Mahomed Hassan (?) now in armed revolt against the authorities of our Protectorate. In view of these incontestable facts Your Highness must realize' that oruS of 'Our territory, especially Soor, possess a very un^nviabl^ reputation in Indian Waters, and that such a state of things is a blot on your administration to which it is high time to apply a remedy. tn reeard to Soor we would remind Your Highness that during the last 2 or 5 years you have been afforded the most convenient and exceptional opportunities for consolidating your authority uhere - opportunities which we are glad to believe you have in some measure made use of. The two expeditions which have taken place connected with the investigation of the Coal Deposits, have rendered the visits of our_ 00(4 our m©n-of-war of mor© frsquont occurroncs than has ever boon the case before, and it has always be«n ^our wieh and pleasure that you should avail yourself of such favourablo opportuni ties to visit Soor and bring yoursolf into closer acquaintance with your subjects and interests thero - Furthermore our Agent at Muscat has had and has our full approval in support ing and assisting Your Highness in any way in which h? can : unobj3ctionably do so, in th3 consolidation of your authority by constitutional methods. We are fain to hop3 that Your Highness has gen3rally profited by thesa favourabl3 circumatances, and that th3 m3a8ur36 tak3n in conn3ction with th3 improv3m3nt of th3 administration of your Customs ther3, in which conn3ction th3 r3turns furn- ish3d to Your Ha,ghn36s by th3 Governm3nt of Bombay must hav3 bssn of mat3rial assistance, hav3 consid3rably improv3d your position in that part of your t3rritory» Finally, within th3 last f3w w33ks, by the grant of a subs tantial loan on 3asy t3rms, we have b3 3n abl3 to put Your iiighn38S in the position to purchas3 a ssrvicsable steamer. The facilities which its possession should afford you in keeping touch with the outlying ports of your territory, should enable you to bring centres of lawlessness like Soor, under your effective control, to an extent which has hitherto not been possible* We exhort Your Highness therefore to persevere in the good work which you have lately begun and for the continuance of which you are now well equipped and to lose no endeavour to free your administration from the odium which your sea—goin^ subjects seek by their lawlessness to bring upon it. At the same time we beg you to realize that the British Government having with their ships and money, assisted so materially to la(; on in a position to consolidate your authority in the u.irections under reference, will be unable to regard with satisfaction/3 GGl-bJ No. 383of 1902.

( 2 ) My Franch coll3agU3 , in tin course of a friendly visit a few days ago , asked me if I had heard of the capture of Omani Dhows in Mozambique territory by the Por- -tuguese . I replied that I had h3ard of it locally , but that I had not seen any authentic details of it from any outside source . Monsisur Laroncethen went on to tell me ♦ ^ that Commodore Kiesel of th3 French Flagship ,f Catinat tT had recently written to him on the subject , and explained that wh^roas certain of the Arabs ( two in thought was the munber ) , wh3n engaged with 9 or captured by the Portu- f f -guese , had claimed to be French Proteges , the French Con -sul at Zanzibar had inquired intA the matter and had as- -certained that they were not really entitled to protec- -tion • I remarked that one could hardly 'b® surprised to hear this and that it was in accordance with the views which many of our Naval Officers in the Indian Ocean had long hald ,name- -ly that owing to the possession of the French Flag by some ' rf ' ' - rif * d m , ■ , ■ - w s - ^ ^ v. ^^ . w w-u v Tw | p H x | of their number 9 Sooris and other Omanis when in danger oflnconv3ni3nt attgntions from msn-of-war , wora in tho habit of running up th^ Franch Flag f wh^thar thoy had any claim to US3 it or not , and that hars was a case in point of his own quota- -tion « H3 admitted that th^ contingoncy was a possibla ons but did not think that such a thing could occur oftan • ( 3 ) . In ths prassnt connection th^ French Consul at Zanzibar was obviously on the horns of a dilemma , for his investigation must either demonstrate that Omanis with trench papers were m'!m- -bers of an organised gang of slave-runners , or else that the members of such a gang availed themselves of the fact that some 0 th ir relations possessed the French Flag in order to claim the sanctuary of it for themselves , The weak point in our argument it -hat up to now ,unless the negociations in process have made any very recent advance in ths,t particular direction , we have not yet succeeded in obtaining from the French any officially authentic list o hobe Omani subjects whom that power claims to protect and we cannot therefore assure ourselves independently and with certaii- -ty as to what were the precise facts in the present case • The 1 id :.t generally however ha.s undoubtedly happened at a most oppor- -tune juncture and I trust the Government of India will see its w&amp;:y to press His Majesty ! s Gov-rnment to push the matter home • ^ 0 lutjio beg to urge that his occurrence warrants our taking any adequate and effective steps that we may consider called for in regard to the future of Soor , and I therefore ven - 'U- 3 ^o recommend cha&gt;. he question of the appointment of an Agent at Soor , suggested in my letter NO,488 dated'20th Septem ber 1900, be reconsidered .X doubt myself whether a Native Agent ot ,h? type now employed at Gwadur and on the Pirate Coast , would be Oi any r^al use , for being a native he would be accorded lit' -tie respect , and unless a man of extremely and loyal character, which it would be difficult to find , he would inevitably be dri- -ven by force of circumstances to allow considerations of perso- -r.al sa^ty and convenience to over-rids his duty to this Consu- -late , The position of an Englishman or quasi-Englishman Would[This Docmaent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Govemment ] 001)!'; PERSIA AND ARABIA.

After landing hospital cases, I left Aden the 2nd June and anchored in Has Keisut imy the evening of the 4th, using the electric light that evening. Ihe next morning weighed and coasted along the Dhofar coast. f 1(, fai is the south-west boundary of the Sultan of Muscat's dominions, and it is larmed out by the Sultan to the Governor of Dhofar, to whom it is worth 20,000 dollars a-year. Anchoring one evening off one of the Koarya Moorya and the next off Ras ana la, to carry out hoats firing, &amp;c., and at the same time to rest the stokers (a very young lot), the weather being very hot. I arrived in Muscat Harbour on the 8th, and secured the stern of ship to rmnacle Hock in the harbour to get broadside on to the ni^ht breeze blowino-. The snip thus lay within a quarter of a mile of the Sultan's ~ Palace. I saluted with twenty-one guns before entering harbour. On Tuesday the 9th June, in company with the Political Resident, I visited the sultan, and the next day His Highness with his son and brother and a numerous suite returned the visit After they had gone over the ship, I weighed and went rn practice, the firing was good and evidently created an impression, iiie oultan expressed himself highly pleased with the trip. The ship was thrown open to the public during the time she was at Muscat and numbers of the inhabitants came on board. pisembarking the Sultan on afternoon of the 10th, I proceeded with Maior Cox, the Political Resident at Muscat, on board to Sur. Major Cox had previously informed me that the Government of India were desirous that if practicable, I should show the flag at Bushire, Koweit, and Bahrein, a er leaving Bunder Abbas. I intended to have telegraphed this information on reaching that port, but found on arrival there, there was no telegraph, so I had to wait till 1 arrived at Bushire, when I immediately telegraphed. . 1 anchored off Sur, the chief port of the Omar Coast and well-known o J Lls Majesty s Government, as the principal emporium; of the Slave Traffic in these parts, and also m connection with the French flag question. ihe Political Resident landed and interviewed Sheikhs, and British Indian traders, of whom there are about thirty in the place, and he obtained some interestino- intormation m connection with an incident which is reported to have occurred a few weeks ago on the African Coast near Mozambique: where a Portuguese man-of-war is said to have captured a number of Arab slave dhows and rescued some 700 slaves. | 2123 a—1J2 after a sharp encounter with the Arabs, a number of whom were killed and taken prisoners. The Snr Community possesses between 250 and 300 fine dhows which make long voyages during winter to Zanzibar, the E,ed Sea, and Indian Ocean generally, and return for the summer just before the burst of the Sur monsoon. Jiy present date (the 11th June) all these dhows should have, according to precedent, returned to Sur where they are laid up and docked during the monsoon preparatory to starting out again. In conversation with Hie Arab Sheikh of the place, Major Cox was informed that all their dhows had returned safely to port, and that there had been no wrecks or casualties. lie was, however, informed confidentially, by reliable members of the British Community who have resided there for years, and are thoroughly conversant with the people and the politics of the place, that from three weeks to a month ago, when news reached Sur of the disaster on the African Coast, there was, for two or three days general wailing and mourning by all the women of the place, and that as far as is at present known, there are 155 men of the community still absent from their homes, among whom are several French prot&amp;^s—of these Major Cox was given the details of seventeen who are generally known and admitted to have been killed in the engagement with the Portuguese, but the Chief Sheikh only admits three casualties, and after the first outburst of mourning they have stopped all such demonstrations and endeavour to put down all local gossip on the subject. About 20 miles inland from Sur, coal has been discovered, and the Sultan of Muscat has promised to give the English the first chance of working it. The British geologist who examined the coal pronounced it of excellent quality, but said he did not think there was more than 250,000 tons of it available at the places he examined. The want of fuel and water would, naturally, make mining operations expensive, but it certainly might be worth while for the British Government to establish a coal ilep6t there, plenty of stone is available for building jetties on either side of the Creek which runs between the two villages. The place is easily defended, in fact the Sultan has a line of forts at the back of the Creek which would defend it. After leaving Sur, I proceeded to Sib and Barka, two towns or villages to the westward, of Muscat. The former is the sanitorium for many of the leading Arabs of Muscat who have date gardens there, and thither send their families during the hottest months of the year. On landing, the Sultan's Representative and various British Indian subjects were interviewed. It appears that just before our arrival the Sultan had received a threatening letter from the eldest son of Sali ben Ali (the Sheikh who, in 1895, raided Muscat, the town being in possession of his tribe for about three weeks: who were, eventually, bribed otf by the Sultan, who besides had to pay heavy damages for losses sustained by British subjects), telling him he would raid the coast in the vicinity of Muscat unless paid to desist, and advising the Sultan to warn British subjects to look out for themselves. Thereupon the Sultan strengthened the garrisons of these places. They amount to about 150 men armed with Martinis. The visit of this large ship will, undoubtedly, strengthen the Sultan's hands in iliuse [daces as exaggerated reports as to size, armament, and crew, quickly spread inland. Leaving Havka on the I'-th, I anchored oft' Bunder Abbas next day, and on the morning of the 14th, lauded and called on the Deputy-Governor, a Persian Major. Mr. Van llooa Meeh, a Belgian, and Collector of Customs there, was with the Uovernor, when 1 paid the ottieial visit. I am told that the Uelgians at Bunder Abbas were supposed to be Russian Agents, that Uovermuent thinking it wiser to employ them than their own countrymen uo, if thus employed, would probably cause various criticisms. \t noun i saluted the Persian Hag with twenty-one guns, and in the afternoon I be Uuputy-Uovernor and bis smto leturned my visit. I then left for Bushire aueboriug olV Uenjan Island that night. Ibis island it'occupied together with K ishm, Lurah, and Ormuz, would form a •;ood nav&amp;l baso iu the event of complications arising in the Persian Gulf.001 On the 17th, I anchored off Bushire—the principal seaport town of the Gulf— though anchored in just over 5^ fathoms we lay 5 miles off the shore and for all practical purposes 8 miles, for all boats landing had to make a long detour to get into the hoat channel. The whole place is capable of much improvement. The inner liarhour and the channel could be dredged and the latter properly buoyed. The Persians have a regular customs administration and their trade is practically with us, so this improvement would be much to our advantage. At noon on the 18th, 1 saluted the Persian flag, and on the afternoon of the IBtli, accompanied by Captain Hunt, Assistant Resident, I visited the Governor. I then proceeded to A1 Heroula and anchored there on the 21st and the next day to Sharja, and showed the flag along the coast passing Cape Musandam at 6 p.m. on the 23rd June, 1902. On the 24th June, I called in at El Badi and Khor Fakar; at both places the Political Resident landed. On the 26th June, I arrived at Muscat, disembarked the Political Resident and took in 300 tons of coal. 1 did not call in at Bahrein : the vicinity is but poorly surveyed and, according to the Chart, I could have got nowhere near the town without great risk.No. 1991 E.

I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, ft 2 - cxrk Major, H.B.M.•s CONSUL &amp; POLITICAL AGENT; MUSCAT.OOPY. No. 1755. B/A. f /-/ i * ft*/ ' 'hf* 3 From, The Under Secretary to the GoTrernment of India in tho Foreign Department, TO, Major P.Z•Cox, G.I.E. Political Agent at Maskat, Dated Simla, the 28tli August 1902. Sir, When yon were in Simla last month, yon enquired whether any objection conld be raised to the issue of an order in Sultan to che effect that the acquisition of property in Muscat by foreign subjects will not be recognised unless it is registered by tho Sultan (or the officer deputed by him) before the transfer of the property takes place. You observe that, if such an order were issued, the Sultan would know before-hand vhen the transfer of any secred or religious pro- ' r as contemplated, and might take steps accordingly, e» g» .ae case of foreclgsure on a mortgage he could pay off the mortgage himself, if he so desired. You also enquired whether, with a view to prevent the sale by British Indian Traders of houses or other property to French or Russian purchasers, it would be possible for you, as Br?.tish Consul, to issue an order to the effect that sales of immovablo property in Muscat by British subjects will not be recognised unless registered in the British Consular Oourt 1$ MP* 40# - flMMS 4MM flJh' &gt; &amp;. before the actual transfer# 9K&amp; ^ -4■*to ^ r r ©' v . : a In reply to your enquiries, I am directed to convey tho following instructions:- With regard to the first proposal, it is clear that =8 (Njli# i .e'-lwr .AA- ^I J Article 5 of tiie Treaty of 1891 with Muscat does not supersede the ordinary rule of private international law, under which transfer of immovable property is governed by the lex loci . It merely permits British subjects to acquire or alienate pro perty by any mode legally Open to the Sultan's subjects. There is no objection to the issue by the Sultan of a law requiring registration for the purpose of giving him notice of the con templated acquisition of property by foreigners, it is not, however, clear from the terms of your reference whether tho precise effect of the proposed order has been, properly under stood. Tt is not known what the local law in Muscat as to the alienation of wakf property may be; but, assuming it to be the same as in India, the issue of the proposed order would not, it is considered, enable the money-lender to sell up any such property which is not alionable|at present. On the other nand, if the local law permits the alienation of wakf property, md f the Sultan sees a pious duty in saving such property from passing to others than Mahomedans, the issue of the pro- i -osed order wil_ no doubt give him an opportunity of perform ing that duty. 3. As regards the second question, it is not clear by what authority a dispute between a British subject on the one part and a French or Russian subject on the other is decided. 3y Article 13 of the Treaty of 1891, the Sultan has divested kimself jurisdiction} but by Article 6 of the Order in ouncil, dated 4th November 1867, His Britannic Majesty's Consul is invested with jurisdiction only in disputes arising between British subjects. If the idea is simply to define the limits of diplomatic redress, there is no objection to aoo anm that you will not exert yourself in the case of %ny transfer to any subject of any other Christain State, un- ]o bb Luch transfer has, previously to its completion, been noti fied to you, Jllj- ' -V J^arthormoro, trndor Artlola 1, of tho samo Ordor.o m iil fj. \itio 3 j DCi'.J.© n ox t&gt;iio posLCB^ opclor S/nd. good Govom— mont of His Majesty's subjects, prohibiting them, under penalty of fine, from transferring property without ree:istra- tion, and could give some effect to such a rule by declining to recognise a transfer in the exercise of your jurisdiction ,i ndoi Article • Tt would not 9 however, be permissible for yO'a to refuse, in the terms proposed, to recognise the transfer n any disp-ate in hich the French or Russian transferee was concerned.

J | &gt; ' No. 433, dated Maskat, the 27th September 1902. From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, I.S.C., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department I have the honour to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter No. 1755-E,A., dated 28th August, on the subject of the transfer of property in Oman. 2. I beg in the first instance to explain further the two points of Maskat usage in regard to which your letter expressed some uncertainty— {a) The law regarding the alienation of wakf property in Maskat is the same as that holding in India, but the difficulty is that Arab subjects in charge of obscure wakf property have been found tempted, when in want of money, to mortgage sucli property secretly to Banyans on the pretence that it is private property, and it may not be for many years afterwards that the death of the mortgagor or his failure to pay the interest causes the Banyan to bring the case into Court. Then the defence is set up by the man or his heirs that the property was wakf and ought never to have been mortgaged; sometimes with reason and sometimes with intent to defraud. (h) It is the usage in Maskat for the complainant to be sent for justice, by his national representative, to His Highness the Sultan if the defendant is a Maskat subject and to the defendant's representative if the defendant is a foreign subject. The com plainant's Consul or the Sultan (in the case of an Arab) has the right of sending a representative to attend the trial, if he so desires. • 3. The suggestion contained in the concluding paragraph of your letter seems to provide, as far as is possible under the circumstances, the remedy that my reference contemplated. On receipt of your communication I dis cussed the subject with the Sultan, and we both came to the conclusion that it would not be possible to trust to any system of registration conducted by his clerical establishment, he, therefore, undertook, by officially promulgating it in Arabic, among his own subjects, to make applicable to them any notifi cation I might draw up affecting British subjects. 4. Under ordinary circumstances I should have first submitted a draft notification to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, for approval, but there were strong reasons existing connected with Monsieur Goguyer's present active intrigues which made it important to act at once. I therefore issued on 13th instant, in anticipation of sanction, the notification, of which I attach a copy for the information of the Government, together with a copy of my covering letter to the Secretary of State. 6. I have purposely left out any special mention of the fact that any document executed in contravention of the notification would not be recog nised at this Consulate, as, had I done so, it would have been necessary to add some qualifying words, such as, ' so far as it affects the British subject.' So far as our subjects are concerned, however, the mere fact that the non-regis tration is made penal, carries with it the fact that any such Unregistered document is invalid for purposes of a civil court, 908 F. D.—S E—116—Oct.Acquisition of property in Maskat by foreigners. I do not see that the notification as it stands contains anything to which the .French could take objection, and I hope, therefore, that the Secretary of State's concurrence will in due course be received. •&gt; - a v. No. 424, dated Maskat, the 21st September 1902. From— Major P. Z. Cox, I.S.C., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty^s Consul and Political Ag -ent, Maskat, To—The Right Hon'ble the Marquess op Lansdowne, K.G., P.C,, etc.. His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to submit copy of a notification which I issued in Maskat on 13th instant with the concurrence of His Highness the Sultan, who has promulgated a copy of it for the information of his own subjects. 2. I consulted the Government of India as to the general position in this connection, but the notification has not been issued with their authority, as there were urgent reasons for the issue of something of the sort without delay, and the responsibility for the form of the notification is therefore my own. I trust it will meet with Your Lordship's concurrence and approval. The reasons for the issue of the notice are twofold :— (1) The British Indian (Hindu Banya) traders of Maskat and other ports of Oman, who are mostly usurers, have become a necessity to the Arabs, but at the same time occupy in their eyes much the same position as the Jew usurer does in Europe, and it is one of the chief difficulties which British representatives in Oman have to contend with, and is an increasing one. In the course of their business these Banyas frequently advance money to Arabs on the security of deeds hypothecating their houses and landed property, situated sometimes at long distances from the coast; and saying nothing about them at the time, produce the deeds years afterwards with the complaint that the mortgagor cannot redeem the property and claim their Consul's interference, to put them in possession. Not to interfere is to some extent damaging to British prestige; to interfere is to sow a considerable amount of anti-British feeling among the inhabitants of Oman which we can ill afford to do at the present day. The notification under report was devised primarily as a remedy to the above state of things. (II) The reason for its immediate urgency is a different one. Most of the desirable building sites in Maskat belong to British Indian subjects, many of whom are not too scrupulous. There is no doubt that intrigues are now going on, with Monsieur Goguyer for their medium, for the furtherance of Russian aims in Maskat. My French colleague told me con fidentially only a few days ago that he knew the individual above mentioned to be endeavouring to get made Consular Agent for Russia, and the Russian Consul-General at Bushire has twice addressed letters to the Sultan in which he expresses the hope of paying his respects to him at an early date. The first thing they will need to do will be to effect the purchase of a suitable building site, and it is very necessary that His Majesty's Consul should be in a position to know what is going on in that direction as far as possible, in view of the fact, before mentioned, that most of the desirable sites are the property of British Indians. 3, The notification only applies to British subjects and, by reason of the Sultan's publishing a copy of it, to Arab subjects; and I am not forgetful of 00118 «•*#««* lAcquisition of property in Maskat by foreigners. the fact that the British Consul could not, on the strength of it, refuse to recognise a transfer of property in any dispute in which the transferee was a Jtussian or a Frenchman, but it seemed undesirable either directly or indirectly ?t 0 t ffi the i ab i 0Ve t 'l l P lica,ion of it, and in its present form . . n likelihood sullice to deter British subjects from entering into any effect SOrt a PP rebeuded ' aad that ^ all that it is required to 4. It has been brought to my notice, during the week, that Monsieur i ,i i,f . Tn a C ; a r e ., ( ; 0py of 14 from tlle Notice-Board, and there can be little doubt bu^ that he will endeavour to make mischief out of it if he can see any means of doing so. I submit, howeyer, that the form of it 'ives the French no grounds for objection, and that, it Monsieur Goguyer should make much ot it, it will be proof of the fact that something of the sort was called t i 1 ! lla . ve tlle ll0n0Ur therefore to reiterate the hope that it will haye Your Lordship s concurrence, etc. NOTIFICATION. r ^ r^ Ua ? 0 ! 0 . f th ? p0wer aDd authorit y nested in His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Maakat by Article I of the Maskat Order in Council, dated 4th -Yovember 1867, for the maintenance of the peace, order, and discipline of His Majesty s subjects residing within the Oman territories of His Highness vtt tt- t V n0t !

Sir, The French Ambassador spoke to me to-day upon the subject of the Memorandum which I had handed to him on the 16th instant in regard to the circumstances under which certain dhows belonging to Sur and Maskat were in the habit of flying the French flag. His Fxcellency told me that he wished me to understand that his conver sations with me on this subject were purely unofficial, and that he regarded the question as being one of very small importance. He reminded me that, although 1 had thought well to make a copy of his Memorandum of the 14th August, he had received no instructions to communicate such a document to me ; he pro posed, in the same way, to take a copy of my Memorandum and to return the original to me. He wished me particularly to understand that there was no ques tion of the French Government desiring to interfere in anyway with the Sultan of Maskat, and that his only wish had been to discourage us, so far as he was able, from any action which might, by obliging the owners of these dhows to give up the flags they already possessed, affect the amour propre of his country. I told his Excellency that I had quite understood his desire that our con versations should be regarded as personal exchanges of views rather than as for mal representations on the part of our two Governments, and that I was glad to learn from him that he regarded the incident as of slight importance and as vir tually disposed of.

I handed to the French Ambassador to-day a copy of the inclosed Memo randum on the subject of the use of the French flag by Suri and Maskat dhows, about which His Excellency had spoken to me unofficially on several occasions, and which was dealt with in a Memorandum with which he had furnished me on the 14th August 1901.!' i V I told M. Cariibon that the result of my inquiries had b^en to convince me that there was not much substantial difference of opinion amongst us, and I read to him the paragraphs (a, to {e) on p. 4 of the Memorardum. His Excellency listened with evident approbation, but somewhat demurred to the statement in paragraph (e) to the effect that holders of the French flag ought not to be allowed French protection when in the territorial waters of Mask at. He promised, however, to consider carefully what was said in the Memo randum. I am, etc., (Signed-) LANSDOWNE. Inclosure 2. M emorandum. The communication made by the French Ambassador on the 14th August last, with regard to the use of the French flag by dhows belonging to Maskat and Sur, had received the careful attention of I lis Majesty's Government, and the statements made by His Excellency have been referred to the British autho rities concerned. I ; ^ hile giving full credit to the officers employed by the French Govern ment in inquiring into the proceedings of these vessels for an impartial desire to ascertain the facts, His Majesty's Government are unable to resist the conviction derived from information which lias reached them frc m various sources, that a considerable amount of slave trading has been carried on by some of the dhows, and that the protection atforded by the French flag has been abused for this purpose. Two of the dhows arrested by His Majesty's ship ' Sphinx ' in 1896 were found to contain 200 negroes, of whom the greater part must have been slaves. In June 1900 it was reported to His Majesty's Government that nearly 1,000 slaves had been imported into Sur that season. Of these 560 were believ ed to have been brought in by dhows flying the French flag. His Majesty's Consul at Maskat reports that since 1st April 'coo he has manumitted at the British Consulate 79 slaves-of these ,9 we're unable to distinguish between one Mag and another, and the depositions of 12 others are not recorded in the Consulate ; but of the remaining 18, no less than 14 deposed that they had been brought from Africa in dhows flying the French flag. A statement made by a British Indian subject resident at Sur on the subject of the slave season of 1901 is annexed to this Memorandum, and seems to show c.can} tr.at t^c rrench flag is used to a considerable extent in this traffic. It seems probable that the inquiries made by the French ship of war ' In ternet on this subject may have failed to elicit 'the facts in consequence of the precautions adopted by the dhow owners to ascertain before arrival at Sur whe ther a vessel of war is present there, and in that case to land their cargoes and remove all suspicious features before coming into port. 2. 1 he part taken by the British Consul in the countroversy between the v ultan and the French Consul on the question of the use of the French fiar bv His Highness subjects has been greatly misunderstood by the French Govern- nient, ^ 1 hey are in the first place, entirely mistaken in supposing that the pultan s Prime Minister receives a pension from the Government of India The late Wr of the Sultan, Saiyid Saeed bin-Muhammad, did not receive from the british or Mntish Indian Government anything either in the way of pension or j r jsents Nor h; s the British Consul ever made use of the subsidy given bv the Government of India to the Sultan for the pi rpose of exercisirg influence in r gard to the question of the flag. It has, on the contrary, been the bultan3 who has appealed to the British Consul for advice and support in regard to this question ; and the influence of the Consul has been not unfrequently exercised to dissuade the Sultan from any rash action, though he has not concealed his opinion that His Highness' right of territorial jurisdiction over his own subjects cannot properly be impaired by the grant to them of the privilege of flying a lorcign flag over their vessels at sea. The circumstances of the Consul's visit to Sur in 1900 and iqoi have also been grea'ly misapprehended. There are from twenty live to thirty Hindu Briiish subjects residing at Sur, fur whose welfare the British Consul at Maskat is responsible He invariably pays them a visit at least once in the year, and his usual time for doing so is just before the monsoon, as all the chief men are then pre-ent. Some time before the visit in June 1900, the Sultan had asked that on the next occasion of a visit he might be allowed to travel a'so by the ship of war conveying the Cousul. So far as the Consul had anv opportunity of observing, there was no ques tion of the use of threats bv the Sultan to the tribes. The Chiefs of all deno minations came to His Majesty's ship ' Sphinx' to call upon him directly he arrived, and took him off to shore, where iht y placed a house at his disposal Two days later Abdulla bin-Salim, the Amir of ihe Beni Abu Aii (one of the two tribes in Sur), came in, w r ith nearly 1,000 men, to do the Sultan honour, and it was owing to his good offices that the Suri flag-holders of both tribes execu ted the Agreement which they gave to the Sultan. In the following year the Sultan did not accompany the British Consul on his visit to Sur. '! he British Consul started for th it plaje on the way to Kalat and Rufsheh, accompanied by a geological expert, to examine coal deposits. The Sultan came down five weeks later at the urgent request of the Consul, in consequence of the difficulties in which the latter found himself involved by the hostile and suspicious attitude of some of the tribes. It is a mistake to attribute to Captain Cox, the British Consul, any desire to press the Sultan to assume an attitude antago listic to the French Govern ment or Consul in regard to this or other questions. 4. On the other hand, it seems to His Majesty's Government not unnatural nor irregular that the British Consul should communicate directly with his French colleague in regard to matters on which the Sultan has appealed to him for ad vice or support. There can be no doubt that, under the Anglo-French Declara tion of the 10th March, 1862. Great Britain and France are equally pledged to maintain the independence of the Sultan and the integrity of his dominions, and that either Government has the right of remonstrating against any action on the part of the other which may appear to be at variance with that engagement. Considering the excellent personal relations which seem happily to exist between Captain Cox and his French colleague, it would savour of pedai try to deny to them the right of direct communication on points affecting these principles before taking the more formal step of referring the question for discussion between the two Governments, and though it may perhaps be argued that Captain Cox gave to his communication too official a form. His Majesty's Government cannot perceive that he w-as at fault in addressing himself directly to M Laronce on the subject of the complaints which he had received from the Sultan. 5. These matters are, however, only of subsidiary importance, and while His Majesty's Government have thought it right to offer the foregoing observations and exp'anations in reply to M. Cambon's communication, they are happv to perceive that, on the main points of the question, the tw r o Governments are prac tically in accord. {a ) They understand that both Governments agree in desiring to maintain the independence of the Sultan, and to aid him in consolidating his authority. {b.) That the French Government is determined to take all necessary pre cautions for preventing slave-trading under the cover of the French flag.4 (c.) That no fresh papers of protection have been granted to Suri or Maska* dhows s.nce June 1900, and that the practice will be discontinued for the future. {d.) That a careful examination is being made as to the validity of present claims to protection oased on the possession of French papars given prior to lune 1900. (&lt;?•) That no riglit of protection on shore or in the territorial waters of Maskat is claimed bv the French Government in respect of subjects of the Sultan of Maskat holding such papers, and that within the Sultan's territory they are to be regarded as subject to his ordinary jurisdiction. These bases appear to His Majesty 's Government to afford a satisfactory settlement of the question. They would suggest that, for the convenience of all parties, it would be desirable that a list of the dhows and owners considered to be entitled to the use of the French flag should be communicated to the Sultan, and supplied also to the British Consul for the information of the British cruisers stationed in those waters. Annex 1. Statement of British subject at Sur regarding Slave Season^ igoi. -Hindu, aged 50, British Indian subject, states : I have resided in Sur on and off for the last 30 years, paying an occasional visit to my home in India. I see anything that passes in regard to slave-dealing at Sur. f do not notice any marked decrease in the number of slaves that come to Sur. According to my estimation, not less than i.ooocame during the past season. Most of them have been taken away, but there are stilf about left. 0 Some Arabs from the Bussorah side are now here. I have seen two of them. T hey are stopping in the house of a man who acts as middleman for the purchase of slaves. The broker's name is Khamis Wad Hajjam of the Jennebeh tribe, but 1 am not sure what section of that tribe he belongs to. These Up Gulf Arabs have, I believe, bought 7 slaves, and will go on purchasing to the extent of the money that they have brought with them, and then clear off in smill country craft. During the past season 6 dhotvs brought large cargoes of slaves, amon^them were the dhows of— (1) Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, (2) Abdulla-bin-Habbab, | )- Beni Abu Ali. (3) Muhammad-bin-Saiyid, (4) Khamis bin ? I cannot remember at this moment the names of the others. The first three came under the French flas:. The dhows that bring them receive 10 do hrs for each slave's passage to Sur. I he men whose dhovvs brin^ the slaves are not necessarily the slave dealers. The chief shippers are— Saleh-bin-Muhammad Wad, Sheikh, Jennebeh, Arab flag. Rubanyeh and Ibrahim, Bakhalil, „ Yusuf, Bakhalil, ' ' »&gt; »» Abdada \\ azir, Pathan or Makrani, also imports slaves. He takes Gun powder and brings back slaves. 1 he slaves come both under the French and Arab flags.All the chief Sheikhs of Sur, whatever their flag, participate indirectly, If not directly, in the traffic. Each man gives money to those that are going tb the African coast for the purchase of two or three slaves. Muhammad Mubarek. Salim-bm-Thabet, and all of them do this. This season good strong youths fetched 130 to 175 dollars each. Ditto girls ditto ... 150 to 200 „ „ Only 15 or 20 females were bought. A great many of the slaves are ship ped by twos and threes up to the Batineh coast at the beginning of the date 00123 season. Muhammad Mubarek's dhow makes one or two voyages during the season. Khamis-bin-Ali's two dhows go two or three times generally to Bombay. Khamis-bin-Musallim's two go two or three times, and on the way back come home via Aden and Mukullah, returning before the monsoon. According to what I hear people say in conversation, mkny slaves come from a district called Mereema. The dhow-owners buy small local craft with which they can run up creeks into the hinterland, where they purchase their slaves at from 5 dollars to 20 dollars each, and then rejoin their dhows. Abdulla-bin-Salim, the Beni Abu Ali Amir, takes 2 dollars on every slave brought in through Lashkareh or other parts in his country ; and Hamood-bin- Sultan and Abdulla-bin-Saeed take 21 dollars between them on each slave landed at Sur. Before me, P. Z. COX, Captain, • • / His D1 {tannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent at Maskat. Annex 2. CAPTAIN Cox , to the British Consul-General at Bushire. Maskat, January 2J, igo2. (Extract.) In continuation of my letter of the 2nd instant, I have the honour to report that I was under the necessity of proceeding to Sur on the 15th instant in con nection with a serious rbbbery which recently took place On the premises of one of the British subjects there, and I then took the opportunity of verifying the information furnished in Inclosure No. 2 of the above-mentioned despatch, under the following circunrstances. 2. I had occasion to interview the chief Banians in connection with the robbery and their affairs generally, and when the man—visited me I said I had mislaid the notes he had given me before, and asked him to repeat the purport of what he had then told me. He proceeded to do so, and his statement was generally in conformity with that made to me two months before. With regard, however, to the names of individuals alleged by him as having brought slaves to Sur under the French flag, when pressed to be very careful to give the exact names of the persons in question, he replied that he almost invariably heard them called by their fathers' names according to the common habit of the Arabs, i.e., the son of so and so, e.g., Ibn Rashid Ibn Saood, and that, while he was quite familiar with their personal identity and patronymics, it was difficult for him to swear positively to their first names, especially where there are two or three brothers of one family.^ A a After exatriinlng—I mingled the names he had given me with {he names ot about seventy other Suris, and went through them all in the presence of the r&gt;anian community : arid of the Sultan's Wall at Sur, inquiring, as 1 called each -name, as to whether the owner of it was still alive and known to those present, and asking details regarding age, tribe, etc. 3. The following is the net result of my inquiries—the man—being respon sible for the details connected with slave-trading, and the community generally for the correctness of the names as now stated in corroboration or modification cf those given by—in November :— (a) The name as first stated was Muhammad-bin-Khalfan. This should read Ali-bin-Khalfan-bin-Rashid of the Beni Abu Ali tribe. Khalfan had two sons, Muhammad and Ali, both of whom habitually engag ed in the slave traffic. It was Ali who brought the dhow home this year. ^He started with 110, but lost 20 en route. He sails under the French flag, and ha&gt;' now left with his dhow for Zanzibar waters. (^.) The name as first stated was Abdulla-bin-Habbab. This should read Yusuf-bin-Khamis-el-Habbab, ' Habbab ' is the family nickname. Abdalla and Yusuf, sons of Khamis-el-Habbab, have been French flag- holders for ten or twelve years, and had a dhow which they sailed under French colours, but it was wrecked two years ago, and Abdalla has since died. Yusuf last season went as a passenger in the dhow of Suweilim-bin-Salim, an Arab subject, and has started again for Zanzibar waters. (^.) The name as first stated was Muhammad-bin-Saiyid, This should read Muhammad-bin-Saiyid-el-Jafferi, His house is at the Beni Abu Ali fishing village of Lashkareh, below Ras- el-Had, but he always docks his dhow at Sur. He flies the French flag over his vessel, f-fe and his brother, AH, brought about forty slaves this year, and have now left again for Zanzibar waters. 4. I have given the foregoing details of my procedure in order to make it clear that to the extent that is possible under the circumstances, I have verified the information previously given me. In my own opinion my Banian informant could have had no ostensible rea son for making a wilfully false statement, and, if it was false, it is extremely improbable that he could have repeated it without any very material discrepancy after an interval of nearly two months. 1 think, therefore, that it may be accept ed as reliable testimony of the fact that the three persons named did engage in the slave trade and under the French fla^. o j G.

I have the honour to report for the information of the Government of India that I have suceeded in purchasing a small steamer the 'Richard Grech' for His Highness the Cultan of Mascat. ♦ A steamer of the kind required was not procurable in the Urit.ed Kingdom or at any of the Continental ports but T obtained this one at Constantinople. 3. The 'Richard Grech' is a single ^ .screw steamer of about 293 tons gross, is fitted with electric light, a fresh water condenser, is most economical in coal consumption. The steamer cost £7,000; incidental repairs and bringing her to Bombay will cost v another £1,000/- . In the opinion of Sir Edward Reed, the t Consulting llcival Architect to the India Office ant. myself, she nearly comes up to the requirements of the Political resident at Muscat and is fully worth the amount paid for her. The vessel is due at Aden during the next few days. A small sunprint of her as now fitted, is sent herewith. (True Copy). Superintendent, Foreign Department.V From (5) nem No. 513 of 190 2. Major P.

I have the honour to confirm the receipt of your telegram dated 28th instant intimating that the steamer purchased for His Highness the oultan was due at Bombay and asking that a trustworthy representative be deputed to take delivery of her. I sent you a telegraphic reply yesterday. 2. The bearer of this letter Seyyid Yusuf Zowawi is the individual deputed and leaves by the s # s. u oimla ,f to night or tomorrow for Bombay, He is a friend and adviser of the oultan but not in his pay. Being the owner of one of the sailing ships plying between Muscat and Calcutta he is a knowledgable man in sea-faring matters, and is acquainted with Hindustani, He will however have an interpreter with him, oeyyid Yusuf himself will have to return here soon, as he is one of the oultan's Delhi deputation and the preparations are in his hands, but he will make the necessary arrangements re garding the ship before he leaves you, 3. Apart from many other matters in regard to which he will no doubt be in need of your kind offices, the oultan asks me to mention the following specifically, and will be grateful if you will direct him as may be necessary. (a) ) i r f(a) The purchase and loading of 100 tons coal in addition to what she carries in her bunkers, (b) The registration of the vessel under the oultan^ name and flag. oeyyid Yusuf will also no doubt consult you regarding the engagement of a Captain and Engineer, 4. The Government of India has allotted a sum of 10,000£ for the purchase of the ship, which will be recover able from the oultan by instalments and you mention that she has cost so far 8,000£ odd, so I take it for granted that any alterations required will come within the 10,000£ and that the ship will be handed over to the Sultan complete without further payment. If this will not be possible will you kindly let me know as I shall have to communicate with the Sultan and the Govern ment of India before anything in excess of that sum is spent. Thanking you on the oulta 's behalf for your good offices in this matter. I have the honour to be, oir.

Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter, No. 33-S.A., $ dated the &lt;4th. September, 1902, on the subject of the trade in slaves carried on by Suri subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. 2. You recommend that, in view of the evidence which has recently come to light as to the participation of Suri sub jects of the Sultan in this traffic, a letter should be aedressed to His Highness exhorting him to nersevere in his efforts to establish.his authority at Sur and to act up to his Treaty obligations in the matter of the slave trade.You also recommend thi f , 5 reorder to enable British ships of war to supoort the efforts made by the Tultan to put doKn the i trade, a list of the Sultan's subjects who possess French certificates should be obtained, as suggested in the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office dated the 25th. March 19012. 3. V/ith regard to the second of your proposals, I am to state that a suggestion has already been made to his Majesty's Secretary of State for India, that the French Government should now be invited to furnish an authentic list of the Omani subjects who are entitled to possess French flags and papers and to state the grounds on which each flag has been given, and the nature and extent of the rights ana privileges which the French Government claim for their protege^ . Should 04 HiHis Majesty's Government be in a position to act upon this suggest ion, it may eventually become possible for His I.;a jestj/ - 's ships of war to take a more active part in the suppression of the slave trade than is practicable under present conditions. 4. In the meanwhile the Government of India are doubtful whether the occasion is opportune for their addressing the Sultan direct or whether adequate reason has been shown for a departure from the usual practice, whereby communications from the Government of India to the Cultan are conveyed through the medium of the Political Agent. It is admitted that His Highness has hitherto acted up to his oblip-ptions in the matter of suppressing the salve trade, so far as has lain within his power. His inability to deal effectively with the question has been due to the fact that hitherto he has no adeouate means of enf ore ing his , authority at Cur^ j his subjects ;have evaded his jurisdiction by flying the French flag. Circumstances are now more favourable, and there is no present reason to suppose that the Sultan will neglect his oppor- tuhi-ties for exercising/more effective control over his Suri sub- jects, although it is undoubtedly desirable that he should receive every encouragement thpt the Political Agent may be able to give him. On a review of the situation, the Government of India have decided to reserve the proposed direct exhortation until the r ultan shows that he ne^ds some special stimulus to reminc. him of his duty, ^here is, however, no objection to Major Cox making a com- munication to His Highness in*the sense of the draft letter enclos- ed with his letter to you No. 373, dated the 29th. August 1902, and he may represent it to the Sultan as embodying the views and wlshes of the Government of India. I pm to request that, ii you see no objection, Major Cox may be instructed accordingly. I have the honour to be.

T aroh 190-, received oy me from the driMsh V^ice-Gonsul at, &gt; ozamoique on the suoject, of the captured Arao Slavers. i 2. The list which accompanies the letter sho^s that an the hundred men were FasKat suoJects,and that 96, if no^j al], oelonged to Soor. The document does not however mention the trioes of the indivl luals and their Ar^oic names have oeen so miin ^led in the course of record and trans 1 iteration, as to oe useless for purvoses of identification. Tt seems most im —portant however that these men should oe thoroughly 1 lentl— —fled oefore they are finally set at iloerty in Oman, and that a descriptive roll of them should oe made outs^or record in this office and future reference in case of any of them oe- -ing caught slave running again. To this end I venture to suggest that as the Dhows o f ihe prisoners have Deen destroyed and they 'swill presu^naoly have to oe given passages to Oman, a request should oe preferred to the Portuguese Government to have them sent to I uscat ina.

It will oe readily understood that the arrival of the delinquents at I'usoat in such a way will not only serve to remind 'the Sultan of his treaty ooilRations in regard to the surpressIon of slavery in his dominions and will afford a fitting opportunity for making a communication to him on the suoject if such is considered advis- -aole out apart from this the event will oe noised aoroad in Oman and cannot fall to have a most oeneficlal effect in Soor and Oman gQnerally. fhen Vice-Gonsul Ghamoers forwarded the despatch aoove quoted the Arabs were still in confinement out as more than a year has now elapsed since their capture,it seems posslole that they may oe released at any moment.

Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent at Maskat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India, and in continuation of this office letter No. 377 of 3rd instant, copy of a communication since received from His ^Excellency the Naval Commandei- in-Chief, and of my reply thereto. 2. I hope to proceed to Sar very shortly, and if I can obtain any corroborative evidence warranting the conclusion that arms are going, or are likely to go, in quantities from thence to Somaliland, I shall communicate again with the Admiral. Seeing, however, that His Majesty's ships cannot interfere with dhows under the Prench flag on the high seas, it is difficult to devise any effective measures fur preventing the arms reaching their destina tion except the close and vigilant patrolling of Sultan Othman Mahmud s coast. In this connection it will interest the Government of India to know that a few weeks ago, when the Persian gun-boat ' Mozufferi' (late ' Selika ') was on an arms catching cruise on the Persian coast of the Gulf and succeeded in capturing one or more dhows trying to smuggle arms ashore, the sale of arms and ammunition in the Maskat market came to a temporary standstill. This shows clearly enough what, in the absence of alterations in the terms of existing treaties, is the most effective means of checking the trade. 3. The Government of India will remember that I have more than once advocated the appointment of a British Agent at Sur. If a trade in smuggled arms between that port and the Mulla's adherents is proved to exist, the fact seems to afford a lively argument in favour of such a measure. No. 49, dated Aden, the 23rd July 1903. From—The Secretary to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indian Station, To—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent at Maskat. I am directed by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to inform you that it is reported on good native authority that from 3,000 to 4,000 rifles and ammunition were landed on the Italian Somaliland coast about 3 months ago from Maskat, and are now at a village 2 days march inland from Boreida. It is said that they were consigned to the feultan Othman Mahmud, who is selling them to the tribes and Mulla, with the latter of whom he is in league. The Admiral will be glad of your remarks relative to the above. No. 386, dated Maskat, tte 4th August 1903. From— M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent at Maskat, To—The Secretary to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indian Station. Your letter No. 49, dated 23rd July 1903, reached me to-day, and only yesterdav I despatched by the down mail a letter to His Britannic Majesty s Consul-General, Berbera, in a similar connection, of which I have the honour to forward a copy. 2. In connection with your present reference, I have the honour to refer you to paragraph 3 of my letter* • Copy attached. 101 of 21st March 1903 to the address of your predecessor.Since then no Somali dhows have cleared from Maskat, and if any arms have gone to Somaliland, they must have been exported piecemeal from Maskat to Sur, and there accumulated for re-export by Suri native craft to Sultan Othman's territory. But I still adhere to the opinion which I have before expressed that, while arms may go from here in small numbers, those that are reported to arrive in Somaliland in such large quantities as the consign ments (3,000 to 4,000) which your letter mentions are, it is true, transported there by Maskat or rather Suri dhows, but are Jibuti and not Maskat arms. These dhows would land them in the Italian Protectorate after disposing and with the proceeds of the cargoes of dates which they take from Oman. At the same time I know that Sultan Othman has correspondents both in Sur and Maskat, and it is not impossible that arms are gradually accumulated at some quiet place and then shipped direct to Somaliland. I think, however, that in that case, as in the instance now reported, interested persons would have taken care that information reached my ears. The belief that the arms mentioned in your letter probably emanate from Jibuti receives support from the dates which you quote. ' About 3 months ago ', say, in April or May, all the Suri dhows would have got rid of their dates and be on the point of starting homewards in order to reach Sur before the burst of the monsoon. If, as I surmise, the 400 or 500 rifles which, according to my information, have recently gone to Sur, are intended for Somaliland, they would be stowed underneath the dates which the dhows will export from Basrah and Oman as soon as the monsoon is over. The dhows would probably get rid of these arms first, then sell their dates, purchase more arms, transport them to Boreida, and then return to Sur next April or May according to custom. 3. I trust His Excellency understands what the position in Maskat is as regards the arms trade, and how difficult it is to take any effective measures to control it. Import is entirely unrestricted owing to the terms of existing treaties. Prohibitions have, it is true, been notified against export to certain localities, including Somaliland, but no supervision or control is exercised over export from Maskat or other ports of Oman, nor is any obligation imposed upon sailing craft to take any clearance from the Local Government when leaving Maskat waters. The difficulty of keeping any check on the traffic has recently very much increased, for whereas the trade was formerly almost entirely in the hands of British Indian traders, in regard to whose transactions the Political Agent was in a position to keep himself informed, a good deal of it has now passed into foreign hands, and at present one French firm and one Russian are dealing heavily in rifles. 4. I had hoped that the services of H. M. S. 'Lapwing' would have been available recently to take me to Sur and other Oman ports, but she was ordered to proceed on to Basrah. I shall, however, take the first opportunity which His Majesty's ships can give me to proceed to Sur and find out what is being done with the arms just taken there, and will let you know the result of my enquiries. No. 101, dated the 21st March 1903. From— M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent at Maksat, To—The Secretary to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indian Station. I have the honour to acknowledge His Excellency's letter, dated Obbia, 28th Eebruary, on the subject of the smuggling of arms by Somali dhows. 2. In this connection I have the honour to refer you to my telegram, dated 8th December last, on the same subject. The dhows whose departure was reported by me to the Resident, for his information and that of the Italian Consul, no doubt include the craft which figures in Commander Pears's report. In fact, no other Somali dhows have been here during the past year.None of them can be identified by name here, nor is the exact date of departure recorded at the Customs Office, but they arrived in the middle of October and left early in November, and one dhow is known to have belonged to the Sultan Othman Mahmud himself, and this is in all probability the ' Makari 3 Dhows hailing from Sur and the southern ports of Oman are the only Maskat craft plying to the Gulf of Aden. They do not call here on their way out of the Gulf, and it is the belief of His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Berbera and myself that any arms that they may introduce into Spmaliland are bought at Jibuti with proceeds of the cargoes of dates which they take to these waters. ■ , Foreign Office Picsb^Ko. 969—2-9-03—40.CONFIDENTIAL. t No: 128 of 1904. 00144 0%, ju^ I' t from, \ s' \ r Captain W.G..OREy, , I*A., ti.

Foldout item on folio 169.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume comprises correspondence and other papers relating to competing British and French interests in Muscat and Oman at the beginning of the twentieth century. The principal point of contention between British officials, represented by Percy Cox (Muscat Political Agent 1899-1903), was the use of the French flag by Omani vessels, permitted by the French Vice-Consul to Muscat, and regarded by the British as being exploited by the region's slave traders as a means of avoiding interference by British ships.Items of note include a letter from Cox to the Political Resident (Charles Kemball), dated 2 January 1902, discussing relations since 1891 between the Sultan of Muscat and British and French officials, the abuse of the French flag in the town, and the need for diplomatic negotiations between Britain, France and the Sultan to resolve the situation (folios 1F-37). Enclosed with Cox's letter is an eyewitness account (from a British Indian subject residing in Soor [Sur]) of slave trading activity in the town during 1901 (folios 31-35). The file also includes a letter from Cox to his French counterpart (Roger Laronce), dated February 1902, explaining that the Sultan protests at what he describes as the French Government's claims to exercise jurisdiction in Muscat territory over Omani subjects (folios 70-71), and Laronce's reply (folion 73); and a report of a tour of the Muscat coast aboard HMS "Amphritite" by Cox (folios 120-22) and Charles Windham, the "Amphritites's" captain (folios 147-49).Reference is made in a number of pieces of correspondence to a confrontation between Arab slave traders and the Portuguese in Mozambique on 18 March 1902 (folios 117-118, and 140-141). In May 1903 Cox writes to the Political Resident, informing him that he has received information from the British Vice-Consul at Mozambique, of around 100 inhabitants of Muscat and Sur being captured and killed in the confrontation (folios 178-180). Cox uses this incident to repeat his recommendation that a British Agent be installed at Sur (folios 145b-145d). Arrangements are also made to loan the Sultan of Muscat funds to enable him to buy his own steamer (folios 123-127), which Cox hopes will encourage the Sultan to take responsibility for his coast, and in particular Sur (folios 135-138). A blueprint of the steamer acquired for the Sultan is included in the file (foldout plan, folio 169).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00020d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
