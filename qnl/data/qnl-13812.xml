The dates in the history are given using the Hijri calendar and have been given in this description, with the Gregorian dates in brackets afterwards.The history detailed in the memorandum dates from 1172 (1758) onwards and covers its rulership by Persia until Kereem Khan Zend [Karim Khan Zand]; the Uttobee tribe who had been residing at Zobarreh [Zubarah] on the Guttur [Qatar] coast and their war with Persia over Bahrein in 1197 [1783] which led to Sheikh Ahmed ben Mohomed al Khalifeh [Ahmed bin Muhammad al-Khalifah] becoming Chief of Bahrein.The memo goes on to discuss the Sultan of Muscat's possession of Bahrein in 1215 (1800); the Uttobees' assistance from Abdul Azeez ben Saood [Abd'al Aziz bin Sa'ud] in retaking the island from the Sultan of Muscat and the ongoing disputes between the two over Bahrein until 1244 (1828). The memo then goes on to discuss disagreements between members of the Al Khalifeh [Āl Khalīfah] family after this period until 1259 (1843) after which date the history of Bahrein is not given as the writer considers it to be known to everybody.The remainder of the memo discusses the history of Guttur [Qatar], its lack of a chief or ruler among those Arabs that resided there and the tributes they paid to individuals and to Bahrein.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023483821.0x000004#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
