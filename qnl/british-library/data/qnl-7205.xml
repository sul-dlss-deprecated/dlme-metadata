HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL MATERIALS PRECIS OF BAHREIN AFFAIRS. 1854-1904. [C943FD]Y PREFACE. Bahrein is perhaps the most important and interesting place in the Persian Gulf. The largest island in the Gulf, it is so favoured by nature and so advan tageously situated for commercial purposes, that it has frequently been the bone of contention between the neighbouring powers. It was once the centre of the commerce that the Phoenicians carried on in the East—if not their original home. The Portuguese held it for many years, but were expelled in 1622 A.D. by the British fleet, aiding Shah Abbass. It was then owned by the Persians for over a century, to be wrested from them by the Uttubi Arabs in 1781. The Persians have in vain tried to re-occupy it. The Imam of Maskat undertook many an expedition to conquer it. The Wahabi Arabs held it in as tributary for some years. The Turks as the Suzerain of the Wahabi Amir, and on other grounds have been persistent in claiming sovereignty over it. While the British Government, enjoying as they have been doing the maritime supremacy n 'the Persian Gulf for over a century, have—in the natural order of things—acquired a political supremacy over the island, which can only cease with their disappear ance as the supreme maritime power in the Gulf. This Precis traces the growth of this supremacy from the year 1854, with a brief summary of the events previous to it, leaving the reader for a detailed narrative of events before 1854 to the chapter on Uttubis in Bombay Selec tions XXIV, 1857. The period of history from 1854 is divided into three parts. The First from 1854-1870, a period of constant disturbances, closing with the events that led up to the proclamation in 1869 of Esau-bin Ah-Khalifa as chief (who still rules), which was followed by protests against our proceedings from the Porte and the Shah. With the accession of Esau-bin-Ali Khalifa, who wisely acquiesced in a posi tion of a Chief under British protection, commences a new epoch. The history of events i n Bahrein from 1870 divides itself under two headings—(l) Protection of Bahrein from external aggression and determination of the Chief's interna tional status under the aegis of the British Government, and (2) Internal affairs and the British policy in controlling them so as to secure Bahrein inter nal peace and prosperity and maintain the Chief's dignity, as well as their own prestige. These two parts form Parts Second and Third of the Precis. 1 The questions will occur frequently when reading this Precis : What is the exact status of Bahrein ? What is its international position ? What is its relation to the British Indian Government ? What is its position compared with the Native States in India ? ' India ' is defined by the General Clauses Act (X of 1897) as including &lt;c British India together with any territories of any Native Prince or Chief under the suzerainty of Her Majesty exercised through the Governor-General of India or through any Governor or other Officer subordinate to the Governor-General of India.' The territory of the Native States is not British territory ; nor are their subjects British subjects. But the Sovereignty over them, as Sir Courtenay Ilbert in his Government oj India, aptly observes, ' is divided between the British Government and their rulers in proportions which differ greatly accord ing to the history and importance of the several States and which are regulated partly by treaties ofiess formal engagements, partly by sanads or charters and partly by usage.' The British Government has undertaken to protect these States from external aggression, but ' as the paramount power,' observes Sir Courtenay Ilbert :— (a) ' exercises exclusive control over the foreign relations of the State ; (£) assumes a general but a limited responsibility for the internal peace of the State ; (c) assumes s. special responsibility for the safety and welfare of British subjects resident in the State ; and C 943 FD(d) requires subordinate co-operation in the task of resisting foreign aggression and maintaining internal order.' A perusal of the Precis will show perhaps that all these conditions are satisfied in the case of Bahrein. If then Bahrein is under the suzerainty of His Majesty exercised through the Governor-General of India, does it not come in the same category as any Native State in India, and may not its relations to the British Government and other foreign Governments be regulated on the same principles as are applicable to our Native States ? If not, what is the exact international status of Bahrein ? These important points will have to be borne in view in studying the modern history of Bahrein. Bahrein has been concerned in many an event in the affairs of Katar and Katif (for instance the murder of party of Bahreinese in Katif), which are treated respectively in the Katar Precis and the Katif and Hasa Precis. It may be noted that important declarations of policy or statements of important facts are italicized for the purpose of easy reference. 8th November igoj., J. A. SAL DAN Ac C, C.

An exhaustive narrative of events in Bahrein from early times to the year 1853 appears in the Selections from Bombay Records of Miscellaneous Information connected with the Persian Gulf^ No. XXIV, new series. A brief summary of the events, however, will not be out of place as an introduction to the narrative of events from 1854 to 1904, and for this purpose liberty is taken to quote » from the Brief History of the Bahrein Is- Secret E., January ISoi No. 529. . * t , *» ^ 1 • t lands prepared by Mr. Gaskin up to the year 1853. While perusing this precis, an occasional glance will be necessary on the genealogical tabl^ of the Bahrein Sheikhs, which is printed as Appendix, A. 2. The history of the ruling family of Bahrein, so far as is known to us, dates back to about the commencement of the eighteenth century, when Bahrein was a Persian dependency. The A1 Khalifa, a sub-division of the Utubi Arabs and ancestors of the reigning Chief Sheikh Esau bin Ali, about 50 years after seizing Koweit in conjunction with their fellow tribesmen, the A1 Sabah and A1 Yelahima from the Persians, attracted by the prospects of the Bahrein pearl fishery, migrated to Zobara, a shallow sheltered bay in the south-west corner of Katar peninsula. Sheikh Nasir, the Persian Governor of Bushire and Bahrein, fearing the increasing influence of the Arabs, repeatedly attempted in 1777 to expel them from Zobara without effect. The A1 Khalifas in retalia tion took advantage of the war and confusion which took place on the death of Kurrim Khan and made a successful raid upon Bahrein, compelling Sheikh Nasir to retire to his fort. The Persians, assisted by the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima, six years later blockaded Zobara, but a determined sortie by a large force drove the invaders back to their boats with great slaughter. A Koweit fleet arriving op portunely enabled the Utubis to follow up their success, and on the 28th July 1783, they captured Bahrein from the Persians. From this date the Persian occu pation of Bahrein terminated. 3. After a period of comparative peace, lasting about seventeen years, the Imam of Maskat subdued Bahrein in 1800 and took twenty-five families as hostages to Maskat. The Utubis returned to Zobara, and with the aid of the Wahabis recaptured Bahrein the following year. The application to the Wahabis for assistance brought them under the yoke of that sect, to whom they paid tribute, and in 1810 the Wahabi ruler took the reins of the govern ment of Bahrein and Zobara into his hands and appointed as his agent Abdullah bin Ufeysan, whom the Utubis drove out in 1811, thus regaining their supre macy over their islands. In 1816 an attempt was made to subdue Bahrein by the Imam of Maskat, who was signally repelled with great loss. From this period forward the Utubis have maintained their rule over the islands. 4. In 1819 the Bahrein Chiefs entered into agreement with the British Govern ment to prevent the sale of British property in their territory. The general treaty* of 1820 with the Arab Chiefs was » See Appendix C. ^ rst s jg ne( j at Ras-al-Khaima on the 5th February by the Agent, and subsequently endorsed on the 23rd February of the same year by Sheikhs Sulaiman and Abdullah, sons of Ahmed A1 Khalifa. 5. With a view to avert the joint attack of the Imam of Maskat and the Prince of Shiraz, the A1 Khalifas concluded through their agent an agreement with the Imam the following year and bound themselves to pay him an annual tribute of 30,000 German crowns, and His Highness in return engaged to release [C943FD] AmssE^nsmmmam 2 some of the Utubi Sheikhs and restore all Bahrein vessels and property in his custody, and the A1 Khalifas subsequently remitted 12,000 crowns to Maskat. 6 In 1823 Ramah bin Janbir settled at Damaum and adopted an offensive attitude towards the A1 Khalifas, but through the Political Resident s mediation a peace was concluded in April 1824. After a couple of years hostilities again broke out amongst them. 7. In May 1828 when Mahomed bin Khamis, Sheikh of the Boo Ayen Arabs residing in A1 Bidaa, was put in confinement by the Utubis for stabbing a native of Bahrein, his followers displayed symptoms of a refractory spirit, but the A1 Khalifas destroyed their fort and all the inhabitants were removed to Ruweis and Fowarah. 8. On the 27th October 1828 His Highness the Sultan of Maskat entered Bahrein harbour with a view to attack Manama, but on the 9th November he was signally defeated by the A1 Khalifas. The following year Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed A1 Khalifa, Chief of Bahrein, adopted an offensive attitude towards the Imam of Maskat in order to harass him, but was not able to do him any harm, save a piracy upon a Morebat vessel. On the 2nd December 1829 a peace was concluded by them, the terms of which were that neither party was to interfere with the other and that the A1 Khalifas should pay the annual tribute to the Imam. 9. In 1830 the Wahabi Chief at Riadh called upon Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed A1 Khalifa to pay the annual tribute, 40,000 German crowns for the horses left in his charge years ago, and surrender the fort of JDamaum to Busheerbin Rahmah bin Janbir. The Sheikhs sent a near relative to Riadh and it was arranged that Bahrein should pay an annual tribute and acknow ledge the supremacy of Amir Turki bin Saud, who should in return give them protection. The Utubis, however, doubted the sincerity of the Wahabis. 10. Through the instigation of the Chief of Bahrein the Amair Arabs left Katif in 1835 and occupied Damaum with a view to blockade Katif. The Sultan of Maskat pledging himself not to interfere in the quarrel, Sheikh Abdullah refused allegiance to the Wahabis. 11. Being alarmed at the Persian threats and the co-operation of the Imam with Persia, Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed concluded a treaty with the Wahabis in the summer of 1836, promising to pay them an annual tribute of $2,000 and they in return promised that they would give him aid in time of need and not call for Bahrein vessels when attacking Maskat. 12. In 1839 Omr bin Oofeysan, General of Amir Feysal, obtained protection at Bahrein on his master's fall. Amir Khalid demanded from Bahrein the tribute and the surrender of Damaum and Tirhoot, as also of Omr bin Oofeysan, but the demand was not complied with. At this period Khorshed Pasha, an Egyptian Commodore, informed the British authority of his intention to reduce Bahrein, but was w r arned against doing so. 13. In the same year, Persia again made an attempt to obtain a footing in the Islands, and despatched an Agent named Haji Kassim with an escort of ten Sirbazes to reside at Manama and to receive an annual tribute which, however, was never paid. 14. Notwithstanding his promise to communicate with the Political Resident prior to his placing himself under the protection of any foreign power, and in spite of the encouragement he received from that official to assert his rights and maintain his independence, Abdullah bin Ahmed A1 Khalifa became a tributary of the Egyptians. He, however, expressly stipulated that no Agent of the Pasha should live in Bahrein.3 i 5. The following year, Mahomed bin Khalifa, grandson of Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed of Bahrein, was invited to assume authority over A1 Hasa as far as Katif, but was opposed by the ruling Chief. An open collision arose, but even tually a nominal reconciliation was effected. The young aspirant applied to the British authorities for help, and proceeded to the Katar coast and com menced opposition to his grand uncle. 16. In 1842, through some plausible reason, an open rupture took place between the parties, and Mahomed bin Khalifa was driven out of the town of Manama, which Abdullah bin Ahmed gave up to his victorious followers to plunder. In this the British Indian merchants lost some property. Mahomed subsequently proceeded to Hasa and Riadh to obtain aid from Abdullah bin Soneyan, the then VVahabi ruler, who espoused the young aspirant's cause, as Abdullah bin Ahmed refused to release his staunch adherent Shafee, the head of the Howajir Arabs, Mahomed bin Khalifa subsequently established him self at Katar, and in 1843 marched against Manama and took possession of it without striking a blow. In the month of April of the same year the forces of his allies joined him from Kenn and made an attack on Moharrag and defeated Abdullah bin Ahmed, who took refuge in a small fort adjoining that island and subsequently surrendered. He was allowed to leave the island with his personal property and followers, but his sons were suffered to remain on the island. The f#-Chief then went toDamaum, which was the only place left now, acknowledging his authority and occupied by his eldest son, Mubarak. After a couple of months Abdullah harassed Bahrein trade and, in consequence, Damaum was blockaded by the allies when both the parties made overtures to the VVahabi ruler at Riadh. In 1844 promised Nejdi land forces arrived under the Wahabi ruler and besieged Damaum, which was surrendered and garrisoned by Wahabi troops. Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed then went over to the Persian coast from where he adopted an aggressive attitude towards Bahrein trade, which was, however, immediately stopped by the British Gov ernment. 17. In October 1845 ^ ^-C^ef and Abdullah bin Said, the Wahabi Gov ernor at Katif, proposed jointly to recommence hostilities against Bahrein, but the plot did not come to a successful issue, and Abdullah bin Ahmed had to flee to Koweit from where he proceeded to Katif and settled in the vicinity of Damaum in September 1846. A couple of engagements took place between the Wahabi Governor and Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa, in which bbth the parties claimed the victory was equally shared. The following year a quarrel took place between Mahomed bin Khalifa and the Amair tribesmen, who deserted the Bahrein Chief and joined the Wahabis, who had already given Abdullah bin Ahmed aslyum at Al Hasa, Alarmed at this, Mahomed concluded a treaty with Amir Feysal, who promised not to aid the ex Chief to re-establish himself at Bahrein, and Mahomed engaged to pay a tribute of §4,000. 18. On 8th May 1847 Mahomed bin Khalifa subscribed to the treaty with the maritime tribes for the suppression of the slave trade. 19. Abdullah bin Ahmed being discontented soon left Al Hasa for Damaum and launched a vessel to proceed to Kenn with a view to obtain aid from the Utubis settled there against Mahomed. Apprized of this, the latter engaged conspirators on the mainland near Fowarit, in which Esa bin Tarif was killed and Mahomed gained a complete victory over his enemies. 20. Abdullah bin Ahmed lost all hope of success. Nevertheless Mahomed bin Khalifa's mind was not to be at rest even at this period. The Utubis located on the isle of Ges were a serious menace to him and he dreaded an attack from them. He applied to the Political Resident requesting h\m either to grant him permission to attack them or give a guarantee for their good behaviour. After a reference to the Government of India it was ordered that no armed4 vessel should be allowed to pass in the Persian Gulf waters, and that any at tack made on Bahrein by sea should be opposed by British cruisers. This, however, was not communicated to Mahomed for fear of his falling into a spirit of lethargy. 22. At this juncture the Sheikh of Koweit through Turkish influence re nounced his state of independence and owned allegiance to the Ottoman Porte and the Mutasellim of Basrah, also exerted his influence over the Chief of Bahrein and a Turkish brig of war made its appearance in th^ Persian Gulf, but to no purpose {as to the policy laid down by us see note below). Mirza Abdul Jabbar, Persian Consul at Baghdad, was also holding out hopes of aid to the ^-Chief, but seeing the interest taken by the British Government in Bahrein, he withdrew his offer and Abdullah bin Ahmed sailed for Zanzibar to seek aid from the Imam of Maskat, but died on the way, at Maskat in 1849. 22. About two years previously Mahomed bin Khalifa had requested the British Government to take Bahrein under their protection, but in September 1849 he was informed that his request could not be complied with, though he was assured of the friendship of the British Government. In the early part of the same year four Bahrein merchants being dissatisfied with the high-handed policy of Mahomed bin Khalifa secretly left for Kenn, where they joined the disaffected band of the Utubis, w T ho now became a formidable enemy to the Chief, and he, being afraid of his enemies, sought help and advice from the Political Resident. The latter ultimately effected a reconciliation between him and the seceding merchants who subsequently returned to Bahrein. Note.— In 184? the Turkish authorities were intriguing, and seeking to induce Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa to renounce his state of independence, and own his allegiance to the Ottoman Porte. A letter was addressed by the Mutasellim of Basrah to the above Chief, inviting him to acknowledge his dependence on the Sultan, and to ' furnish lists of his vessels, crews, etc., in order that the requiste registers might be prepared and forwarded.' A Turkish brig of war, too, visited the Gulf, and although she did not actually repair to Bahrein, the better perhaps to conceal her designs, still there seemed no doubt that an effort was being made by the Porte to extend its influence over the Arab Tribes in the Persian Gulf. Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa sent, it is true, an evasive reply to the com munication he had received from the Mutasellim of Basrah ; but yet from the tenor of a conversation held by him with the Resident (complaining that double duties had been levied from the vessels of his subjects and dependents by the custom house authorities at Bombay, and urging that no such demand had been made upon the ships of those who owned allegiance either to the Shah or the Imam of Maskat, that unless the British authorities therefore refrained from enforcing extra fees and customs from the people, he would be compelled to follow the example of the Sheikh of Koweit, and place himself under the guardianship of the Porte) it became manifest, that if the British Government in India wished to preserve their paramount influence in the Persian waters they must adopt measures to rectify the present irregularities, by coming to a speedy understanding with the Bahrein Chief. (Major Hennel, Residents letter No. 3, dated 10th May 1847.) The harbour fees, etc., alluded to by Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa had been levied in consequence of his vessels not being furnished with the requisite passes ; yet to show him how unwilling the British authorities were in any way to alienate or estrange his affections, the amounts were subsequently refunded, and he was informed that for the future all Bahrein vessels leaving the Gulf must be provided with registers, signed by the Resident, 'else would they render themselves liable to the extra duties levied on foreign vessels entering Bombay harbour.' , ** With reference to the designs of Turkey to establish a supremacv over Bahrein the Bombay Government informed the Resident that it is obviously desirable to exclude as much as possible all interference, by foreign powers, in the affairs of the Persian Gulf, since it is only by retaining the supreme authority in its own hands that the British Government can hope to secure the permanence oj the objects it has gained tn that quarter at such a large expense!' (Letter No. 337, dated 31st July 1847.)^ The Board of Directors agreed with the Bombay Government in thinking ' thai any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British naval force in that Gulf, and we authorize you to inform Major Hennel [the Resident) accordingly, (Despatch dated 6th October 1847).5 2 j' JJ 1 ® ftl '° win g y ear the Wahabi Amir Feysal created trouble, but towards the end of July 1851 a peace was concluded through Sheikh Syud bin Tahanoon, and the fort at Al Bidaa was handed back to Sheikh AH bin Khalifa, a younger brother 01 the Chief, who was to pay an annual tribute to the Amir. .f4; peace, however, was not enjoyed for any length of time. In i 8=;2 the Wahabi Amij placed the surviving sons of Abdullah bin Ahmed at Damaum opposite Bahrein and a few miles below Katif, at which Mahomed bin Khalira was much annoyed and bitterly complained against Amir Feysal to the Political Resident and threatened the Amir that he would stop paying the tribute unless he removed the sons of the Chief from Damaum. Sheikh Ah, however, by force of argument, persuaded his brother to pay the instalment of the tribute which was then due. Thus was judiciously cleared for a time the storm that was gathering over Bahrein. . 2 4 a - Meanwhile the Bombay Government had asked the Government of India for instructions as to the action to be taken in case the Wahabi ruler should make an attack on Bahrein, and had fortified themselves with their authority ' to offer every obstacle to an attack upon that island by the Wahabt Chief, on the ground that, Her Majesty's Government would not admit the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Government or any one acting for it or in its interest {Foreign Department letter No. ///, dated loth May 1853).

Hereupon Commodore Balfour was despatched with the Persian Gulf Squadron to the scene of action, and the very threatening attitude assumed by this officer soon induced the Wahabi Governor of Katif to abandon his designs, and humbly sue for pardon. In reporting the Commodore s success, the Resident expressed an opinion that we had borne too long with Feysal, who, while giving us fair words still falsified all he said by steadily pursuing his fixed object of universal dominion along the coast. He recommended direct reprisals upon the ports from which the recent piracies had been effected the pirates he added 'of the Eastern Archipelago, of Tunis, Algiers, of Riff, and Salee have all had their visitation, and no humane Government has ever questioned the legality of such reprisals Theie was some correspondence on this occasion between Feysal and the Resident. Feysal, after justifying his proceedings on the ground that the Sheikh of Bahrein was one of his own feudatories, whom for his various misdeeds he had a perfect right to chastise, protested against British interference in the following terms u Between the Wahabi Amir and the British Government Treaties have been made by the several authorities, authority after authority • and, in accordance with treaties between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan Abdu'l Mejid, there are matters which every one is precluded from meddling with unless on special grounds.' To this the Resident replied by declaring that the British Government recognised Bahrein as an independent Chiefship, and was prepared to oppose all foreign agency, including that of His Highness the Amir oy every means in its power; he also pointed out the inconsistency of Feysal claiming to be dependent upon Turkey at the same time that Feysal's Lieutenant at Katif was committing piracy on vessels bearing the Turkish flag. [ C 943 FD ] BUpon receipt of the Resident's reports the Resolution adopted by the Government Government of India's letter No. 948, dated 17th of Bombay, and approved by the Govem-* March 1800, Volume 106-A. of 18 o. ment of India, was to insist on the expul sion of the refugee Sheikh Mahomed-bin-Abdullah from the Wahabi port of Damaun, where for 16 years his incessant intrigues for the recovery of Bahrein had been an element of disquietude extending over a considerable portion of the coast. 26. The Resolution of the Bombay Government (dated the 15th February Page 277 of Bombay Political Department, l ^ 0 ) I s quoted below : Volume 105-A of i860. 'Commander Balfour appears to have performed the duty entrusted to him by the Resident, with grpat skill, firmness and judgment, and the Resident may be requested to convey to him the marked commendation of Government for the services rendered by him on this occasion. The display of naval force at Demaun has for a time averted the hostile demonstration against Bahrein by Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdulla assisted by the Wahabi ruler, but the Right Honourable the Governor in Council can place reliance on the promises of the Abdullah, and consider that the time has arrived when some measure of coercion must be employed. Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdulla has now for 16 years been attempting by intrigues to re-establish himself at Bahrein, and his plots not only occasion disquiet in Bahrein, but have from time to time endangered the tranquiility of all the neighbouring tribes The British Government has frequently warned Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdulla, that if he continued to disturb the peace and security of that part of the Gulf, it would be the duty of Government to remove him. This course has heen urgently required by the Sheikh of Bahrein, and the reluctance of the British Government to have recourse to an extreme measure evidently created some distrust in the mind of the Bahrein ruler as to the sincerity of the friendship of the British Government. He has seen repeated warn ings met by repeated promises, and repeated promises followed by renewed intrigues and renewed hostile organizations. The British Government cannot permit these feelings of insecurity to continue. It must also look to the fact regarding which there can be no reasonable doubt that the Sheikh at Demaun is abetted in his designs by the turbulent ruler of the Wahabis, that he is indeed little more than a tool of Amir Feysal and that the ascendancy of the Wahabis in that part of the Gulf was regarded by Captain Kemball and is regarded by the present Resident as equivalent to their intention of piracy. It appears then to the Right Honourable the Governor in Council that it will be a warning to the Wahabis and to the other adjacent tribes, that it will restore confidence to the Sheikh of Bahrein, and that it will close a long series of intricrues and petty hostilities, if the measure long threatened be now adopted of expelling Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdulla from Demaun. This is the measure advocated by the Resident and one which the British Government has long foreseen would be necessary. The Resident is therefore authorised to announce to the Sheikh at Demaun that he can no longer be permitted to disturb the peace of the Gulf, that he must leave Demaun and reside either at Gram or on the Persian shore, as may seem most expedient to the Resident. At the same time the Sheikh of Bahrein should' be required to assign such a sum for the maintenance of Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdulla as may be considered sufficient, to this the Bahrein ruler has always professed his willingness to consent The Resident will take care not to demand the expulsion of the Sheikh from Demaun, until he has sufficient force at his command to put down all attempts at resistence, and he will be particularly cautious to make his demonstrations entirely of a naval character and not to be betrayed into any operations on shore''. 2 7. ^ June 1861 the Resident, in compliance with the Government Reso lution above mentioned, wrote to Amir Feysal, requiring him to eject Mahomed bin Abdullah, the refugee Sheikh of Bahrein from Damaum, and recommending him to enter into a peaceable convention with the Sheikh, whom by our recent treaty we had recognised as the rightful ruler of Bahrein. Five months havincr elapsed without any reply from Feysal, the Resident in November 1861 again took the Squadron down to Bahrein, and after an u hour's firing, in which no casualty occurred on either side,' compelled Mahomed bin Abdullah with all his faction to flee from Damaum. ' From all 1 could learn,' wrote the Resident ' the Wahabi authorities and traders on their coast were inwardly delighted at the loner pending question being thus settled, although His Highness the Amir could not with due regard to Arab hospitality, openly compel Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdullah to relinquish the shelter he had offered him. In any case His Hi^hness's castle and garrisons, both at Damaum and Katif, forbore to molest us hrany way and on our part orders were issued to respect them so long as they continued inactive, J7 CHAPTER III. (I) Tyranny of the Chief of Bahrein, (2) His unfriendly attitude towards the British Agent, British subjects and their trade, 1858. 27 -A. While the security of Bahrein was always threatened by external enemies, the people of Bahrein enjoyed little peace and contentment within the island itself. 1 he ruling chief, Sheikh Mahomed»bin-Abdullah, was a man who combined in himself the worst qualities of a bad tyrant, the most unbridled lust and creed of wealth, and an uncontrollable temper, ignorance and impatience against restraint. He was most arbitrary in his dealings with the merchants, mostly Indians, and any remonstrance against his conduct on the part of (he British Agent he responded to only with insults. 27-B. In 1858 thebanyahs residing in Bahrein, complained to the Political Resident, Bushire, on two points against the Chief:— (1) that he levied duties on exports, as well as imports, which alone had been taxed before. (2) that he prohibited them from proceeding to Katif, and actually laid an embargo on one of their vessels carrying the British Flag. It was also reported that the Chief's tone to the British Agent Haji Jassim at Bahrein was very insolent. 27-C. Captain ^ Felix Jones took prompt measures to put a stop to the vagaries of the Chief. He deputed Lieutenant Disbrowe, Assistant Resident, with a letter to the Chief to remonstrate with him. Lieutenant Disbrowe pro ceeded with Commodore Jenkins to Bahrein on board the sloop-of-war the \95£ Cli ' ve in Se P tember 7^8. On arrival at Bahrein Lieutenant Disbrowe despatched Captain Felix Jones' letter to the Chief, and warned the British Indian residents to be prepared to leave the island wi.hin 24 hours, in case the demands made^vere refused. The first result of this measure was that the buggalow beaiing the British flag, which had been laid under embargo, was released, and Sheikh Ali, brother of the Chief, was deputed to Lieutenant Disbrowe to offer an explanation of his conduct. As regards the prohibition of buggalows bearing the British Flag proceeding to Katif, the explanation was that the Wahabi Governor of Katif was an enemy of the Chief and that, it was feared, the visit of the vessels there might raise disagreeable compli cations. To this Lieutenant Disbrowe rejoined that the British Fla' was fully able to uphold its dignity in every corner of the globe without assistance from other powers. As regards duties, what the British Government wished, was that they should not be of an arbitrary oppressive character. To this Sheikh Ali raised no objection. Assurance was also given that the British Agent would be treated with every respect due to his position. The Chief also requested that Lieutenant Disbrowe would come and visit him, to enable him to discuss divers matters. As this request was not complied with, the Chief proceeded personally to the sloop of-war C/ive, and expressed his regret in the presence of Lieutenant Disbrowe and Commodore Jenkins at having by his conduct given cause for offence and disagreement. Both these officers returned the visit of the Chief, when as a compliment to the British Flag, an Arab Flag was hoisted on his residence, and a salute was fired. 27-D. On receipt of the report of these proceedings, the Bombay Govern ment expressed their pleasure to learn that the Chief was induced to make amends for his contumacious conduct and expressed their opinion that Lieutenant Disbrowe performed the duty assigned to him with judgment and firmness (Letter No. 3945, dated 6th November 1858}. Chapter IV.—Mahomed bin Khalifa seeks Turkish as well as Persian protection. Status of Bahrein defined, 1859-1860. 28.^ Mahomed bin Khalifa then began coquetting with both the Turkish and the Persian Governments and playing them against one another and one or other of them against the British Government, while under the shelter of either of them.he^ could pursue his own aims of self-aggrandizement and oppression of British Indian and other traders in the islands of Bahrein, and pursue bis forays against the Wahabi ports. In these attempts he was more than once checked by the Political Resident towards the close of 1859. About this time he des patched a messenger to Baghdad to make an offer of his allegiance to the Porte. On account of the absence of the Governor General at Baghdad at the time, there was some delay in accepting this offer, until the arrival of Mustafa Nouri Pasha, who forthwith despatched Mahomed Beg to ascertain the propriety of acceding at once to the request of the Chief of Bahrein, and if satisfied on that point to hoist Turkish flag. Meanwhile the Chief had applied to the Prince Governor of Pars for the Shah's protection. This application met with immediate response and Mirza Mehdin a great anglophobe, was deputed to Bahrein to declare the Persian sovereignty over the islands. The Persian flag was hoisted, when the Turkish Agent Mahomed Be^. arrived. The Persian flag was then hauled down and in its place was hoisted the Turkish flag. The Persian Agent, however, refused to leave the place and insisted on exercising the Persian control • Bombay Political Department, Volume io6-A over the islands. (See* letter of Officiatino - Ife6o 1 , o Political Resident, Mn Hyslop, No. 66. dated 6th June i860.) 29. When Captain Felix Jones heard of these events, he addressed several despatches to Sir Henry Rawlinson, in which he took somewhat alarming views of the proceedings of the Persian Agent. Sir Henry Rawlinson replied to Captain Jones on 4th May i860 in an interesting despatch, extracts of which are quoted below:— ^ 'My impression on reading these letters is that you have attached somewhat more importance than they merit to Mirza Mehdi's proceedings at Bahrein. It seems to have been the normal condition of Bahrein for some years past that three rival authoriHp&lt;; the Pasha of Baghdad, the Wahabi Amir and the Prince Governor of Pars, should lay claim j ? e nd, and endeavour either by intimidation or intrigue to suoer- sede the independence of the Sheikh. &gt; Hostilities against Bahrein from any quarter are to be repelled by us by force of arms ; whilst the voluntary tender of the Sheikh's allefiancp to any other power, so long as it is not followed up by military oocupation, is to be ignored as of no practical importance. . ^ r &gt; ^ guuicu * * * i. Ve P oint Jf d out t0 ttie Shah's Ministers that the assertion of a right of sovereiVntv oyer Bahrein w.thout the means of realizing that right, or accepting its obligations is fim- ply ridiculous and may place them in a very awkward and indignified position. The Sheikh for instance, may at any moment tear down the Persian flag and expel the Persian aS from the is.and ; or Turkish influence being at some future time in the ascendant he may r.K ^ nsferr . 1 ^ h f IS alIe ? iance from the Persian to the Ottoman Government or the Wahabi Chief may interfere to rescue what has been so long accounted as the soil of Arabia from the Persian dominions. &amp; as tne soil ot I have further pointed out that under no possible circumstances can the British Gm, ernment be expected to concur in the proposed the Persian Crown since we have contracted e island as independent Chiefs, and since the maintenance ' pensahle to the successful ■working of those plans of maritime policy in the Persian Cuff which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish. Persian uuij The Shah's Ministers have been so far moved by these arguments as f-n • j that no attempt shall be made to realize their claims to the ^sovereigntv of R.h P^ om ' sed military occupation ot the island and further that orders shall be sent to Shiraz to 'absta' 3 from any discussions with you on the subject of your relations with the Chief abstain suit of a reference to Englancf and the firther consideracion^Ttt'^ne^reS iTtS 3®* Captain Lewis Pelly, also wrote to Captain Tone 5 ? nn t stating that the Sheikh of Bahrein had recently applied to the Prince Governor o ars or assistance in arms and ammunition and troops, but that the Shah'o Government had given him explicit assurances that ni further s in.

Captain Pelly therefore deprecated resiLnce of any kind to any attempt on the part of Persia to occupy Bahrein! eS1Stance9 3 , • Captain Jones, in submitting the correspondence between him and Sir Henry Rawlinson and Captain Pelly, asked for instructions of Government, and the following was the reply given by the Bombay Government (letter No.' qac dated the 8th September i860);— ' 1° r e ply I am desired to inform you that copies of this correspondence will be for warded to Her Majesty's Secretary of State by the next Overland Mail, and the attention Her Majesty's Government solicited to the inportant subject under discussion. In the meantime and until the pleasure of Her Majesty's Government is ascertained the Governor in Council has the following plain instructions to impress on you for your guidance with reference to the complications which now surround the Bahrein question. . The dependence or independence of Bahrein is a subject for the consideration of Her Majesty s Government and no exertion should be spared by you to preserve tranouillity in the Gulf by the diplomacy, or if necessary by pacific demonstrations, until the question has been determined. But whether the Sheikh of Bahrein displays the ensigns of Persia or of Turkey, he can never be permitted to make hostile encroachments on tribes under the protection of the British Government. Any measures of this nature the Governor in Council anticipates will be immediately curbed by a peremptory expression of the Resident's will, supported, if necessary, bj a naval determination. An actual resort to force, which might be justifiable under Article IV of the Treaty with the Sheikhs of Bahrein of 1820, for the coercion of the Chief, should, if possible, be avoided,^ as^ tending to engage the British Government in hostilities not merely with a petty Chief in the Gulf, but with one or other of two powers at present in alliance with England. On the other hand, it is desirable that you should sternly control any attempt of any neighbouring tribe, or confederation of tribes, to assail the integrity of Bahrein. The more difficult question remains, as to the manner in which attempts to assert their claims on Bahrein either by Persia or Turkey are to be met. Captain Lewis Pelly writing without knowledge that the Sheikh had displayed the Turkish flag, deprecates resistance to any attempt on the part of Persia to occupy Bahrein. It may be gathered from his despatches and those of Sir Henri Rawlinson that such an attempt was deemed improbable. The indication of the Sheikh's allegiance to Turkey may, however, lead to some demonstration of the kind. The Governor in Council deems it therefore advisable to ins truct you not to interfere with any occupation of Bahrein either by Persia or Turkey, further than by protest, and by an intimation that the subject has been remitted for consi deration by Her Majesty's Government. You should at the same time distinctly inform the Agents of either power that no hostile attempt by Bahrein, or in the name of Bahrein, on the neighbouring tribes will be permitted, and that any such attempt will be opposed by force. In communicating these instructions for your guidance the object of this Government is to leave Her Majesty's Government without embarrassment in dealing with the Bahrein question, while at thp same time the tranquillity of the Gulf, the security of the maritime tribes, and the prestige of British authority will be preserved. I am desired to add that the tenor of your despatch to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople is approved.' 32. The Bombay Government also in their despatch No. 37, dated the nth September i860, requested the instructions of the Secretary of State for the guidance of the Political Resident, Bushire, observing as follows ' It appears to this Government that the tranquillity of the Persian Gulf which has been so long preserved by the policy of the British Government demands that Bahrein should he regarded as subject neither to the Sublime Porte nor to Persia ; hut that its independence should be recognised, while those engage* ments are maintained, which in the interests of commerce^ humanity, and public security it has concluded with the British Government, ' The status quo appears to us to be the alternative suggested by every consi deration of good policy in preference to a recognition of the claims either of Turkey or Persia ; claims the establishment of which would lead to no good result to Bahrein, or to either of the contending powers, while to the best interests of the maritime tribes of Oman it would be disastrous.' 33. The Secretary of State expressed approval of the views of the Voiatse 850! 1861. Bombay Government in his despatch No. 2, dated 10th February 1861. [C943FD] Clo CHAPTER V. Mahomed-bin-Khalifa blockades Wahabi ports, but compelled to raise the blockade by the British and to sign a perpetual treaty of peace, (2) Turkish protest against our proceedings, 1861, 34. In May, 1861, Captain Felix Jones received news that Sheikh Maho Letter from the Political Resident, dated ist med-bin - Khalifa had entered upon the June 1861. Volume 85 of 1861. blockade of the neighbouring Wahabi ports with six armed vessels and was perseveringly employed in harassing the trade and pearl fisheries of Damaun and Katif. Captain Jones thereupon proceeded to Bahrein with the full Gulf squadron. He arrived at Bahrein on 18th May, and from that date to 28th May, he tried in vain to induce the Chief of Bahrein to stop his aggression. The Chief, it appears, was decided upon ignoring all British interference and authority, secretly instigated as he had been by Persian agents, who had promised him even the assistance of a French vessel. Under these circumstances and having regard to the decision of the Secretary of State (Despatch No. 2, dated 18th February 1861), Captain Jones concluded that forbearance had reached its limits,- and directed Commodore Drought to take the necessary measures to stop the Chief's ships from blockading the harbours of the Katif coast. The able disposition made by the Commodore placed two of the Chief's finest war boats, then preparing for further aggressions, within the power of the British squadron without firing a shot. 35. The Chief thereupon climbed down, and after some negotiations con ducted through his brother Ali, was induced to sign a Perpetual Treaty of Peace See Appendix D. abstain from war, piracy and importation of slaves by sea on condition of protection against similar aggressions and to fermit\all British subjects to trade with Bahrein on payment of an ad valorem duty of five per cent on their goods. Captain Felix Jones caused one of the boats captured (the Tawileh) to be restored to the Chief, but retained the other boat (the Humreh). 36. The Government of Bombay approved of the measures adopted by the Political Resident to compel the Sheikh of Bahrein to withdraw his blockading squadron from the Wahabi coast ; but considering the contumacy displayed by him, they thought that the boat Humreh should not be returned to him, until the Political Resident deemed his conduct worthy of such consideration' being shown to him (letter No. 194, dated 23rd July 1861). 37. The Bombay Government also asked the Government of India for appro val of the Treaty signed by the Chief, which though obtained without previous express sanction, would in their opinion be justified in the circumstances and was calculated to render the Sheikh more amenable, than he had for a very long time been to those rules of conduct, his disregard of which had been for several years the occasion of alarm to his neighbours and anxiety to the British Govern ment (letter No. 59, dated the 23rd July 1861). 38. These strong measures elicited a remonstrance from the Turkish Gover nor General of Baghdad. He wanted to know by what right we have had bom barded Damaun, a place which, as lying within the territory of ' Feysal Beg, Turkish protest against British proceedings the Kaimmakam of Nejd,' was 11 part of 10 1 186 !; TT ^ ^ the hereditary dominions of the Sultan.' To which Her Britannic Majesty s Consul-General at Baghdad replied that we had hitherto ' always maintained direct relations with Amir Feysal as well as with all the Chiefs and Principalities situated on the shores of the Persian Gulf- that our pacific policy in the Gulf was well known, and that in the prosecution of that policy we had never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of any other State—an authority or jurisdiction moreover which assuredly the Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter.' In reporting this correspondence to Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople the Lonsul-Ueneral wrote as followsII ' Although it may not be denied that, since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1839-40, j4 mir Fey sal has remained\trihutary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion it is certain that the Porte has never exercised any jurisdiction, or attempted to extend its authority ) over that country* Were it otherwise, were a Turkish administration established capable of controlling the pro vince, restraining the Wahabis and their dependents from the piratical practices for which they were once so notorious, and finally of preventing or giving satisfaction for any breach of international law, such a state of things might be as conducive to good order, as it would be certainly less burdensome to the British Government than the maritime surveillance, which, in the interests of commerce, the British Government is now compelled to maintain in the Persian Gulf, But in point of fact, the Porte has not the power to punish or coerce its tributary; not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country; and to judge from my own experience of the duties of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, I feel assured that, were the relations of that officer with the Amir of Nejd to be disturbed in a manner to with draw the Wahabi Coast from his immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudi cial to the policy which has hitherto obtained under the orders and sanction of Her Majes ty's Indian Government in that quarter.' 39. In April 1862 the Resident reported that he was making another and a final effort to effect a peaceable settlement between Amir Feysal and the Chief of Bahrein, but that he much feared open war between the two parties was inevitable. CHAPTER VI. (1) Restoration of captured buggalow to Chief Mahomed-bin-Khallfa, (2) his illtreatment of Indian subjects, (3) confiscation of the Chiefs buggalow, (4) Persian protest, (5) Wahabi claim to Bahrein, 1861-66, 40. On the conclusion of the engagement of iS6i,we have seen, one of the ... „ , o~- Chief's war vessels was restored to him, but Volume 95 of 1866. .1 . • 1 . , ' . the other was retained as a security for his good conduct. After the appointment of Colonel Pelly to the Persian Gulf, he recommended that the Chief's buggalow should be restored to him, in the hope that the measure would be viewed as an earnest of his conciliatory policy towards the Chief of the Gulf. This recommendation was acceded to by the Government of India, but the only acknowledgment offered by the Chief of Bahrein for the consideration shown to him was, as Colonel Pelly reported, 'a remark disrespectful to the Viceroy.' 41, Colonel Pelly writing from Bahrein on the 17th December 1865, with reference to the conduct of the Chief, and the proceedings he found it necessary to adopt towards him reported : ' During the three years I have been in the Gulf I have endeavoured with every friendly advice and means to keep the Chief in a common sense line of conduct. Never theless the British Indian subjects resident in his Island have once been driven by his tyranny to seek refuge at Bushire, and the more wealthy among them would not return. ' Among other complaints was one of a large sum of money asserted to be fraudulently withheld by the Sheikh from our subjects. On visiting Bahrein about a year and nine months ago I caused this matter to be minutely gone into, and on the conclusion of the enquiry, the Sheikh promised to compromise the matter by a payment of 17 thousand krans; and both he and his brother attached their seals to a document so purporting. The Sheikh failed however to fulfil his contract, and when I again visited the island about 9 months ago I found that he had committed a further tyranny by extorting 3,000 krans from the Banians. I then addressed him a remonstrance : ' On my arrival here the other day I found the Banian's claims still unsatisfied. I then informed the Sheikh that if he did not forthwith fulfil his promise I should be compel led to adopt measures for securing for our subjects their just dues. He still used every means of evasion and in point of fact have been detained here 8 days. •'It is needless to trouble Government with the details of the endless petty insolences with which the Sheikh is chargeable. But it appears to me that his relation to the Waha bis is, under present circumstances a matter which might have inconvenient results, if the Wahabis should succeed in carrying out their policy of again bringing the entire sea board of the Arabian Coast under their direct influence, a costly experience has shown us that that state of coast rule is synonymous with piracy on a large scale, and as a war bugla of 500 tons and pierced for 10 guns might do serious danger before any British ship of war should arrive. I have confiscated the Sheikh's bugla, and I would propose to seU it paying any balance that may be due to the Banians out of the proceeds and divide ing the remainder of the proceeds among the crew that took the bugla.'12 Colonel Pelly added 'Since writing the above the Bahrein authorities have come to percieve that their policy was as ill-judged as unjust. At the last moment the money claim of our subjects was satisfied, and they expressed their desire to escape from the Wahabi influence. I do not believe in the latter change unless it should be supported by one of our ships of war. 'The Sheikh's war Bugla was caught in a hurricane while I was towing her across to Bahrein, the skilful seamanship of Captain Warner, Commanding Berenice saved her during the storm, but she sank shortly after reaching harbour. It is probable however that we shall succeed in recovering her.' 42. When intelligence of Colonel Felly's proceedings at Bahrein reached the Persian Government, the Shah's Minister for Foreign affairs addressed a remonstrance to Mr. Alison in the following terms ' The Persian Minister viewed Your Excellency's reply about Captain Jones' treat ment, in 1278 A. H., 1862 A. D., of the vessel belonging to Mahomed-bin-Khalifah, Governor of the Bahrein Island, which is the sole property of Persia with sorrow; and expected that at all events, the British Resident would never commit a similar act. But it is a cause of great regret that the British Resident has again forcibly seized a vessel called the 'Dinar' belonging to the said Governor and that he has moreover bored a a hole in it so as to render it useless. 'By command His Majesty the Shah I beg to inclose a copy of the agreement* • See Appendix B. concluded by the respective Agents of England , an ^ Persia, relative to all questions arising in the Gulf, specially about Bahrein. After your perusal of the said agreement, you will perceive to what extent this behaviour of the British Resident is contrary to the condition of that agreement and also a source of grief. ' The original of this agreement under the hand and seal of the Plenipotentiaries of the two Governments is in the archives of this office and ready for your inspection if ne cessary. 'The Persian Minister has no doubt that Your Excellency will not fail to make a speedy arrangement for preventing the recurrence of such behaviour on the part of the P. rit ij| Functionaries and that you will also take steps for giving compensation to Mahomed bm Khahfah; and I most respectfully beg that you will inform me of the steps you have taken. 43. With reference to the allusion by the Persian Minister to an agreement purporting to have been executed by a British Agent in 1822 containing an acknowledgment that the island of Bahrein had always been subordinate to the Province of Fars and|its possessors, the Government of India enquired whether the Bombay Government had any information as to the authenticity of the Political a, December 1866, Nos. 7-8. Tl 1 N0, 745» Volume 95 of 1866, Qated 20th July 1806). In reply the Govern ment of India was furnished with copy of a correspondence which had passed between Mr. Bruce and the Bombay Government in 1822, regarding an agreement entered into that year by Mr. Bruce, as Resident in the Persian Gulf, with the Prince Governor of Fars, from which it appeared that the Bombay Government in a letter written to the Prince in November of the same year had disavowed the so-called treaty and desired it to be considered as if it had never been written.' (Letter No. 1 79 dated 17th August 1866.)

From certain official documents, the liability * See Bombay Selection., No. XXIV, p. 291. to tribute at leaSt WOuld Seem t0 be admitted.^ Also Palgrave's Travels, Vol. II., p. 20J. His Excellency in Council would be glad to have this point definitively settled, for from the corre- ,86, F y nm 3 1 ' spondence in i86it and the Treaty the To Bombay Government, dated 23rd July ratified, it would appear that Her Majesty'n 1861, No. 900. Government hold Bahrein to be independents not only of Persia, but of Turkey, and by implication of the Wahabi Power also. 4. In respect of the Bahrein buggalow (which has since sunk, but of the recovey of which Colonel Pelly expresses hopes), I am instructed to say that His Excellency the Governor-General in Council assumes, from the expressions used in paragraph 7 of the letter of 17th December last, that Colonel Pelly did not intend to finalK- confiscate the vessel without a reference to His Excellency the Governor in Council, and through His Excellency to this Government. It should be understood that for the future no such final confiscation can be allowed to take place by order of the Resident without a reference of this nature. Serious complications in the relations of the Government of India with respect to the Powers bordering on the Gulf might otherwise be the result.' 43-B. A communication as promised in paragraph 2 was made to Mr. Alison, and it was approved by the Secretary of State (Despatch No. 37, dated the 28th February 1867). 43-C. As regards the Wahabi claims to Bahrein, Colonel Felly, upon refer ence referred to the previous declarations J of the Court of Directors, Her Majesty's Government, and the Government of India, which showed that the British Gov ernment would not admit of the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Govern ment or any one acting for it. Colonel Pelly also reported that he learnt from an envoy of the Chief of Bahrein ' that the Chief of Bahrein holds himself absolutely independent of the Wahabi ruler in so Jar as the islands of Bahrein are concerned, hut that the Chief having occupied certain lands in Gwetter on the mainland of Arabia, receives revenue from these lands and pays to the Wahabi Amir the sum of 4,000 dollars per annum, on condition that the latter prevent his tribes from molesting the people residing on the Gwetter lands The Gov ernment of India expressed the opinion that so far as these lands were concerned it might be presumed that he owed fealty to the Wahabi Government, but in regard to the Bahrein islands, the Chief was independent and owed allegiance to no other power (Foreign Department letter No. 2J4, dated 22nd March iSbJ, Volume 84 of 1867.) 43-D. As to the buggalow itself the Government of India ultimately decided Volume 95 of 1866. to restore it to the Chief of Bahrein, if she Political a, December 1866, No. 9. was j n a s tate to bear the voyage (Govern ment of India, letter No. 1206, dated 3rd December 1866). An attempt was made to tow her to Bahrein, but it ended in only sending the boat to the bottom of the sea. CHAPTER VII. (I) Disturbances in Persian Gulf. (2) Violation of the Maritime Truce by the Chiefs of Bahrein and Abuthabi. (3) Ali-bin-Khalifa made Chief of Bahrein, 1867-68. 44. In October 1867, Sheikh Mahomed Khalifa, Chief of Bahrein, in concert with Sheikh Said bin Khalifa, Chief of AbuthabL, attacked and plunder ed the Katar tribes on the neighbouring mainland of Arabia. The particulars of this outrage are as follows :— 45. Sheikh Ahmed bin Mahomed bin Suliman, the representative of the Chief of Bahrein, on the Katar Coast, seized a From Secretary to Government, Bombay, No. Bedouin of that COast, and Sent him off to ,2 Lt\1 i „ 6 ;Vj 0 u n nVS ,Nos. 92 . 9 3. Bahrein. The ostensible reason for such a proceeding was, that the Bedouin had visited his tribe. The headmen of Wakrah, Bidaa, Doho, and Dowha demanded the release of the captive. Their demand not being complied with, they resolved to expel Sheikh Ahmed from Wakrah. Hearing of their determination, Sheikh Ahmed left with his family and goods for Khor-i-Hassan, and, on arrival, reported the matter to the Chief of Bahrein. The Chief thereupon released the captive Bedouin, and sent a letter by him to the head-men of Katar, assuring them of his desire for a continuance of friendship, and inviting some of them to visit him in Bahrein. In answer to the invitation, the Katar people sent explanations and an apology for having turned Sheikh t Vide paragraphs 22 (footnote), 24A, 29, 32, 33. [C943FD] D. VI sent a Sheikh under Sheikh H Ahmed out of Wakrah. The Bahrein Chief accepted the apology, and swearing to keep peace with the Katar people, invited one Jasim bin Mahomed to enter into a new agreement for the conduct of affairs on the coast. Jasim accordingly went to Bahrein, but no sooner did he arrive, than he was seized and cast into prison. The Chief then force of 500 men in 24 boats, under the command of his brother, AH bin Khalifa, together with a land force of 200 men, undei Ahmed. On their way to the coast, his fleet fell in with some 4 0 ^ Katar boats and captured them. At the same time he solicited assistance from the Chiefs of Debay and Abuthabi. The former declined compliance, but the latter, despite the warnings of the British Agent, responded to the call, and sent a force of about 2,000 armed men in 70 boats. On seeing the Abuthabi fleet, the Katar people became greatly alarmed, and despatched a messenger to beg for mercy and protection. They were re-assured, and were lulled into unsuspiciousness, till the Bahrein fleet also arrived. The combined fleets then blockaded the coast, and sacked the towns of Wakrah, Bidaa, Doho, and Dowha. The total value of the property plundered and destroyed was estimated at over 11 lakhs of Krans.* • ^50,000. The pillage was commenced by Bahrein and Abuthabi acting in concert, continued by the former separately, and concluded by the latter, whose forces robbed the people even of the rafters and doors of the houses. After the towns had been JjiTl w^.S•8 Go ' r '°' en, • B ° nr,bay ' ,S5 ' sacked, the inhabitants were ordered to (F/ate letter from Captain Way, No. 89, dated embark and leave. No sooner did they 12th May.) ^ were se j zec [ ant ] stripped of what little property had escaped the general pillage. Eventually the great bulk of the inhabitants of the Katar coast were scattered, some being deported, and others having taken refuge in other ports along the Arabian and Persian Coasts. 46. As the Wahabi Amir had some pretensions to suzerainty over Katar, the plundered inhabitants sued to him. He took up their cause and threatened the Chief of Bahrein with hostilities if the booty were not returned, and the inhabitants restored to their homes. The Amir is said to have said that, ' as his intentions and those of the British Government coincided, no further harm should again happen to the people from seaward.' The Chief of Bahrein braved the wrath of the Wahabi by confiscating property that had hitherto been spared, and deporting afresh certain families who had been allowed to return to their homes. 47. The Wahabi Lieutenant was, consequently, directed to make pre parations for an attack on Bahrein, and it was (23rd April) reported that a coast tribe, owing fealty to Nejd, had already attacked and plundered some Bahrein subjects. % 48. In June 1868 the Katar tribes, finding that they had got no redress, From Sec etaryto Government, Bombay, No. took the law into their OWU hands and 139, dated7th July. retaliated on Bahrein. A sea fight ensued, in which some 60 craft are reported to have been destroyed, and upwards of 1,000 lives lost. 49. As soon as intelligence of the aggression committed by the Chiefs From Secretary to Government, Bomb.,, No. IJ, O f Bahrein and Abuthabi reached Colonel dated 17th January 1868. Pelly, that officer reported the matter Proceeaings. 1 ebruary.868, Nos. 137-38. to the Bombay Government, suggesting the advisability of taking serious notice of it. He observed that the only vessel available for service in the Persian Gulf was the Hugh Rose^ a gun-boat manned by a Native crew, not able to steam more than eight hours consecutively. He also solicited authority to inform the Abuthabi Chief that this flagrant infraction of the maritime truce on his part would not pass unnoticed. The Bahrein Chief might, Colonel Pelly anticipated, plead that the Katar people were his subjects, but even then he was restricted by the terms of the maritime truce from hostile action by sea ; and as for the Abuthabi Chief, no such excuse could be preferred for his conduct. 50. On the 17th January 1868, the Bombay Government called upon Colonel Pelly to report the steps taken From Bombay, No. 13, dated 17th January 1868. by him to mark the displeasure of the Proceedings, February 1868, Nos. 137-38. t) ■ 1 . 1 rr v 1 • British Government at the offending conduct of the offending Chiefs. They had also authorized him to address the Chief of - f!'5 Abuthabi to the proposed effect, but pointed out the inexpediency of threatening a blockade at a particular given time, as, from the present necessity of employ ing every available vessel for the Abyssinian expedition, it might be impossible to carry out the threat. 51. Receiving the desired authorization. Colonel Pelly, on the 21st January From Secretary to Government of Bombay, No. l86b, addressed the Abuihabl Chief tO 37, dated 13th February 1868. the above effect, advising him to restore Proceedings, February X868, Nos. 3.9-30. the plundered property without and to send an accredited person to the Residency on this matter. His First Assistant, Captain Way, reported as follows:—'All are waiting to see what action Government will take regarding the late Katar affair. Should the Abuthabi Chief escape punishment, the other Chiefs will, one and all, claim to be released from their engagements.'^ 52.

He also reported that there was a secret understanding between the Chiefs of Bahrein and Abulhabi to the effect that the former would reimburse the latter any sum which the British Government might compel Abuthabi to pay. 56. On the 6th June, the Bombay Government authorised Colonel Pelly to From Bombay, No. 128, dated 6th June 1868. address to the Chief of Bahrein a commu- Proceedings, June 1868, Nos. 92-93. nication of a similar nature to that address ed by him to the Chief of Abuthabi. 57. On the 7th June, Colonel Pelly telegraphed to say that he had deferred the blockade, as, though the Sinde had come, he found that she had no shot for her guns. He would, he said, await the arrival of the further force promised by the Bombay Government. 58. On the 8th June, he addressed a letter to the Abuthabi Chief, stating - D . M q ^ t , that, as the expected assurance of an in- From Bombay, No. 138, dated 7th July. : . r . r , tention to make reparation tor the outrage had not been sent, he should shortly proceed to Abuthabi to compel him to act up to his engagements by (i) paying ij lakhs of krans ; (2) restoring to Katar the persons and property that he had removed ; (3) giving assurance of regret for the past, and better conduct in future. 59. On the 9th June, Colonel Pelly was authorised to blockade Abuthabi From Bombav, No. m, dated 9th June. provided that, UOW that the Si tide had return- Proceedings, June .868, Nos. 94-95. ed, he felt assured that the force at his dispo sal was sufficient for the purpose. They, however, cautioned him against adopt ing any coercive measures which were not certain of success, and promised to send a more efficient force shortly.i6 60. On hearing of the retaliatory attack of the Katar tribes on Bahrein, the Governor General in Council on 1st July desired the Bombay Government to at once communicate with the naval authorities for the despatch of a suitable orce to the Gulf, and to report the steps already taken for that purpose. As soon, it was added, as ships are available, Colonel Pelly should be instructed by telegrap to warn Bahrein and Abuthabi once more that unless immediate reparation be made, they and all others taking part with them would be punished. 61. On the 19th July, in reply to the instruction of the Government of India of the 17th, the Bombay Government promised to communicate more with Commodore Heath, but anticipated delay in getting a reply. They stated that a vessel could probably be armed expressly for this service at once, if sanctioned by the Governor-General in Council. 62. On the 20th July, the Bombay Government reported the arrival, at Bombay, of Her Majesty's ships Vigilant and Argus, the former for survey and repair, and the latter en route to China. If the senior Naval Officer should consent, the Argus would be diverted from her destination and sent to the Gulf, her Commander being instructed to act in concert with Colonel Pelly. 63. On the 21 st July, the Governor-General in Council expressed his concurrence in the views of the Bombay Government regarding the despatch of the Argus to the Gulf, and suggested that the Sinde might also return to Bombay, take a supply of shot for her gims, and return to the Gulf to assist. 64. On the 22nd July, the Bombay Government telegraphed as follows :— ' The Vigilant will be ready to-morrow, and will sail for Gulf on Friday. Captain Brown is instructed to demand reparation by payment of a heavy fine, which he will enforce by all the means at his command. But as his crew is small, he will be told on no account to land or undertake operations on shore. He will meet Colonel Pelly and consult with him at Bushire.' 65. On the 23rd July, the Bombay Government was informed that it was very desirable that Colonel Pelly should accompany the Commander of the Vigilant. Besides this telegram a letter was addressed to the Bombay Government , , , T , pointing out the serious nature of the To Bombay, No. 797, dated 23rd July. r ^ • iV n • /-&gt; if i . l L present crisis in the Persian Gulf, and the obligation of the British Government to take immediate steps for punishing such aggressions as those committed by the Chiefs of Bahrein and Abuthabi. The Government of India, it was observed, had, till the telegrams of the 19th and 20th July, not been informed what measures had been taken to carry into execution their orders of 7th February, to which attention was drawn on the 14th May. On the presumption that the Sinde had been sent in fulfilment of that order, it needed explanation why she was suffered to proceed without shot for her guns. It was matter of regret that Colonel Pelly had issued a threat which, from the unprepared state of the Sinde, he had been unable to execute. Now that a sufficient force had been despatched to the Gulf, it was hoped that everything would be done to fulfil the treaty obligations of the British power, and exact reparation from the offending Chiefs. 66. In his letter No. 77, dated 22nd June 1868, Colonel Pelly reported the particulars of the retaliatory attack made by the Katar tribes on Bahrein. He also made some important observations as to the policy to be followed in the Persian Gulf, and suggestions for inflicting exemplary punishment on the deliquents :— ' 10. I would respectfully draw the attention of Government to my letter No. 43, of 23rd April 1866, in which, while submitting some half-dozen cases of renewed breach of the maritime peace, I ventured to submit that f ' our withdrawal from the maintenance of maritime peace in the Gulf would be the signal for piracy on a large scale.' 11. I would beg also to draw the attention of both Government and of Her Majesty's * No. 52, of 17th December 1865, and No. 29, Secretary of State to my letters* noted, in of4th April 1868. which I have earnestly represented the inad- visability of these piratical Arab Sheikhs of the littoral being encouraged in the mainten ance of war buglahs.17 12. I understand it to be the wish of an influential section of the British public that the Persian Gulf route protracted into the valley of the Euphrates should be developed as a principal line of communication between Europe and India. Every year we are increas ing here our lines of telegraph and frequency of steam communication. A point of set tlement for trade will soon be a necessity ; and yet, notwithstanding these civilizing circumstances and prospects, if Government were to withdraw from the Gulf, were it in other words, to let it be dearly understood that the British Government, had ceased to maintain the maritime police of these seas, my firm conviction is that within three months from the date of this withdrawal being generally known, trade in the Gulf would be im possible, the Persian sea-board would be plundered, and the Gulf would be a scene of maritime disorder from north to south. . I 3. No officer can more sincerely dislike than I do punishing any of the tribes, esoe- ciaHy Arab tribes. But in my opinion an example is now necessary, and the Bahrein Chief is the man who should feel the force of it. 14. I append a complaint received from one of our subjects resident at Bahrein whose boat was plundered oil Katar during the attacks above summarized. 15- Also a second complaint from a British subject similarly located, complaining of the Custom House authorities at Bahrein having seized some copper that had been con- signed to him. 16. But the losses of property in Katar and elsewhere during the piratical proceed ings above noticed have been so considerable and intermixed, that I have no hone of arriving at an accurate estimate of their total. 17 I understand it is probable the Sheikh of Bahrein may plead that Katar is in part subject to Bahrein, and that, under such conditions, he is responsible for the conduct of the Katar people. But even conceding this position, the fact of Katar being subiect to him would be no plea for his organizing, in conjunction with the Abuthabi Chief and without reference to the arbitrator of the maritime truce, a sea expedition resulting in promiscuous destruction of life and property. 5 18, The Minister for Muscat, who is now with me, is entirely of opinion that the proceedings of the Chiefs should be severely noticed, and that, if these are passed orer the views and position of Government in regard to the Persian Gulf will be grievously misunderstood, 5 19. The loss and.plunder involved on the proceedings of the Bahrein Sheikh are roundly estimated at above two lakhs of dollars. The Sheikh of Bahrein is reputed wealthy His island is the centre of the finest pearl fishery known, and his revenue is considerable 1 am of opinion that he should be called on to pay a fine of one lakh of dollars (which he could readily do), and giye security for future peaceable conduct at sea, or, failing this that he should receive such punishment as Government may be pleased to consider pro per 20. The Chief s fort stands close to the shore line on one of the Bahrein islets, named Moharrag, his craft fish for pearls on the neighbouring bank, and it will be fo- Govern ment to consider whether a Chief who has acted as this Chief has done should continue to receive the advantages of the maritime truce. 21. I would respectfully request explicit instructions by telegraph, in order that mv language and proceedings may be entirely conformable with the policy of Her Majesty's Indian Government. I await these instructions before addressing the Bahrein Chief or taking any action. But Government are well aware that when dealing with wild tribes if punishment have to be inflicted, much of its effect depends on punishment rapidly fol lowing the offence.' ^ 3 'P. 5'.—Since writing the foregoing, the Bahrein Chief, alarmed apparently at infor mation of Government's intention to notice the recent breaches of the peace at sea has deputed an Agent to me with a letter, in which the Chief, w^hile remaining wholly silent concerning his aggressions, complains of the retaliatory attack from Katar. I have explained to this Agent that the Bahrein Chief's proceedings are well known to me from many sources ; that I have reported them to my Government; and that I can hold no further communication with the Bahrein Chief until I receive instructions from India I learn from the Muscat Minister that this Bahrein Agent has now called on him in view to inducing him to give a favourable complexion to the Bahrein Chief's piratical pro ceedings. The Minister, however, in informing me of what had passed, simply repeated his conviction that, if Government do not punish the Bahrein Chief, we may exoect vet more serious affairs—a conviction in which I fully participate.' [C943FD] „i8 67. The Bombay Government addressed on 23rd July the following letter to the Commander of the Vigilant com- Poiiticai a , August 1868. Nos. 136-138. municating instructions as to the measure to be taken against the offending parties (No. 1762, dated 23rd July 1868) : 'By desire of His Excellency the Governor in Council, I beg to enclose to you copies of recent telegraphic despatches received from His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, which will put you in possession of the circumstances under which His Excellency has requested you to proceed on special service to the Persian Gulf. His Excellency requests that you will, on your arrival there, put yourself in communication with Lieutenant-Colonel' Pelly, Her Majesty's Resident at Bushire. The intimate knowledge possessed by that officer of the present state of affairs in the Gulf, and of the circumstances which have rendered the interference of this Government neces sary, will be of great assistance to you in forming a judgment as to the measure necessary to carry out the instructions of the Viceroy conveyed to His Excellency in the telegram of the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India of the 17th instant. 2. The two Chiefs against whom your operations will have to be directed are the Chief of Bahrein and the Chief of Abuthabi. The first of these Chiefs has been the principal instigator of the late disturbances in the Gulf, and his proceedings for years past have been the subject of repeated remonstrance on the part of the Resident. His conduct, with reference to the late attack on Guttur, calls for exemplary punishment. 3. His Excellency conceives that he is justified in desiring that you should require from this Chief the immediate payment of 100,000 dollars the surrender of the armed buglahs emploved in the late expedition, and such security for his future good behaviour as Lieutenant -Colonel Felly shall think necessary. Should the Chief refuse or hesitate to comply with these demands, you will use all the means at your disposal to enforce them. 4. With reference to the Sheikh of Abuthabi, His Excellency is not informed of the ability of this Chief to pay whatever fine may be imposed upon him ; but a demand, similar to that which you will make on the Chief of Bahrein, must also be made on him, and you will consult with Colonel Pelly as to its nature and amount. He should also be called upon to indemnify the loss of the merchants specified in Colonel Pelly^s despatches 68. The Viceroy also telegraphed to the Secretary of State on 13th Septem- . , . 0 u 0 , M , ber 1868, briefly stating the facts and pro- Political A, September 1869, No. 160. . ^ ^ v 1 it posing that the naval authorities should send three or four of their smaller vessels to Bahrein, to be placed under the direction of Colonel Pelly, and adding that ' Piracy in the Gulf must be sup pressed at once'. This proposal was acceded to by the Secretary of State. Colonel Pelly proceeded to Bahrien with these vessels of war, H. M. S. Vigilant, and the gunboats Clyde and Hugh Rose. When the Chief, Mahomed bin-Khalifa, heard of these movements, he absconded to the Katar coast. The fort of Moharrag was destroyed, the war craft belonging to Mahomed- bin-Khalifa was burnt, and a fine of I lakh dollars imposed on the Sheikh of Bahrein. An agreement* was signed on 6th September 1668 by AH-bin-Khalifa * See Aooendix E and the principal persons of Bahrein by which they declared Mahomed-hin-Khalifa to have forfeited by his piratical outrages all claims to the Chief ship of Bahrein and Ali-bin-Khalifa bound himself to pay the fine imposed. Ali-bin- Khalifa, who had held the Government jointly with his brother, was permitted to continue in power, and after about a fifth of the fine had been realized and distributed rateably among the sufferers, the balance was remitted. I 69. The opportunity was taken by Colonel Pelly also to mediate between the Chief of Bahrein and the Chief of Bidaa (Mahomed-bin-Thani) and he concluded an agreement between them determining the amount of the tribute annually payable by the latter to Bahrein and manner of its payment. He also obtained from the Chief of Bidaa an agreement never to make -war by sea against any tribe of Chief, 70. A fine of 18,000 krans was levied on Chiefs in the neighbourhood of Makran for compensation ot losses sustained at that place by British subjects Political A, Pro.

Of this sum 16,200 Political A, December 1868, N03. 39-41. krans were paid to two claimants, who had given proof of their losses. The result was regarded by Government as satisfactory. CHAPTER VIII.

A similar protest was sent to Colonel Felly by the Foreign Agent at Shiraz. The Political Resident made the following interesting comments on this In his letter No. i, dated 16th January 1869. ' Government will perceive that the Persian Foreign Minister pretends tRat Bahrein ' is the property of Persia.'

The Persian Foreign Minister pretends that ' the right of Persia over the Port of Omman ' (Omman, including the Muscat territories, and a portion of the Arab littoral20 known as the Pirate Coast, and along which are located many independent Arab Chiefs with whom we have treaty engagements,) is a treaty stipulation between England and Persia If so, I must plead ignorance of the fact^ nor can I suppose that Government would, for an instant, acknowledge any alleged claim on the part of Persia to sovereignty over Muscat and our Arab Chiefs. The Persian Foreign Minister would pretend io dread that we may use force against Persian Islands. 7 he simple reply to this is that Persia owes the possibility of trade in the Gulf and the tranquillity of her Gulf littoral wholly to the British Maritime Police of the Gulf. Persia has not a gun afloat to protect her own shore, and the Arab Chiefs have, on more than one occasion, expostulated with me for preventing their old sea raids and have frankly admitted that, if it were not for the British Resident, they would seize every Persian merchant craft and plunder the Persian sea ports. My opinion, based on many years' observation and experience, is that, if we were to abandon our maritime protection of the Persian Gulf, trade m these waters would soon become impossible, and the ports on the Persian littoral would become subject to hostile attack, and, perhaps, full into the hands of Arab Chiefs. ' r f &gt;J It is remarkable that, while the Persian Foreign Minister would pretend to dread violence on our part towards Keshm and Ormuz, the Persian Governor General of Southern Vide my Reports No?. 32 and 45, dated respec Persia is indebted to me for havine* nlaced a May y 1 £ h 8. aDd23rdApn1, ^ Na 52 ' dated 9th ^n*boat and the ,st Assistant Resident at his ,, • , , iTT* 1 , disposal, in view to enabling him to inspect those islands. His Royal Highness has, as Government are aware, expressed his thanks and satisfaction for the same. I observe that the Foreign Minister incidentally refers to Angaum as a Persian De '' ,ber ,8,56 ■ j sla ' &lt;i ' Sii r : he ^ o ^ my letters now noted ' . . , , . 1 have not troubled Government with mv pinion on tins question, unless when it was especially called for by the Viceroy. But Vide Government Telegram of 5th August 18681 I think that His Excellency the Governor in and „p, y rffth ,d. m , Councjl would probab| wisl / t0 have his atten _ tion attracted to the present allusion to Angaum. The Persian Foreign Minister asserts I gave no information of my intended movements on the Arab Coast. I submit that I am in no way accountable to Persian authority in respect^ to my duties in ^Arabia. As a matter of fact, however, I did, in an unomcial manner, and in the course of friendly conversation, inform the Prince Governor General of Fars cf the Government intention to punish the Bahrein Chief. At the same time 1 should not wish this unoffieia 1 circumstance to be adduced, as some inconvenience might thence, perhaps, result to His Royal Highness. Government will recollect that just before proceeding to Bahrein, the danger to the t ersian Coast, from the inflamed state of the Arab Coast, was so imminent, that I Vide my telegram of 19th Aagust 1868. telegraphed to Mr. Alison on the subject, and sent i-f.i ^ u. .u . 1 j . f f 0 P&gt; of m y telegram to India. I entertained little doubt that, had it not been for the recent check given to the Arabs, a descent Vide paragraph 6 of my letter No. n j , dated on the Persian ports would have, ere'now Fmd 25th September 1S68. taken place&gt; ' On the w r hole, Government will probably deem fit— istly. i o ^ adhere to their fixed policy of declining to allow, or even to discuss 1 ersia s pretensions to sovereignty over Bahrein or Omman ; and Government will, perhaps, concur tvith me in considering that, under all the circumstances of the case, a letter cf thanks for maritime protection &amp; would have been at once^ more reasonable and appropriate than is the present protest on the oart of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs.' 71A. A copy of this letter was sent by the Bombay Government and by them to the Secretary of State, with the observation that ' it contains additional proof that Bahrein is and has for many years been considered by the Govern ment of India and the Secretary of State to be independent of Persia. 72. The Persian Minister in London also sent a protest to the Foreign s. h . 1869, Nos. 35 -36, Office, dated 13th April 1869, ^nd our , , t t j * po l icy towards the Chief of Bahrein was described in a letter from the India to the Foreign Office, dated 21st Aoril 1869:— ' ^ ' The British Government have hitherto carefully abstained from recognizin? either directly or indirectly, the validity of the claim, on several occasions, advanced bv Persia to the nght of sovereignty over the island of Bahrein. Moreover, the Sheikh of Bahrein in his capacity of an independent Chief has contracted obligations towards the British Gov' ernment for the suppression of war, piracy, and the slave trade, which are indispensable to the success of our measure of maritime police, and of which the local Governor of Bahrein who is possessed of considerable naval resources, is alone competent to secure the fulfil31 .. ,.T 0 wbsfttut* the distant and ineffective authority of Persia for the direct respon sibility of the local Chief to the power, which controls the maritime policy of the Gulf would he fatal to the policy which has so long and advantageously been maintained m this part of the world. 73. But although the Duke of Argyll (the Secretary of State for India) was at this time of opinion that the policy could not be abandoned, he wished to avoid causing unnecessary irritation at lehran and was willing as a matter of courtesy to the Persian Government, to issue instructions to the Government of India to direct the Resident in the Persian Gulf (whenever he might on any future occasions under orders from India be about to call the Chief of^Bahrein to account for any breach of his engagements to the British Government) to notify the fact to the British Minister at lehran for the information of the Shah's Government. 74. Accordingly the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the Earl of Clarendon addressed the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London the following letter dated sgth April 1869:— ' With reference to my note of the 16th April, in which I acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 13th, enclosing two letters from the Sheikh of Bahrein, I have now the honour to state to you, that I have considered, in communication with Her Majesty's Sec retary of State for India, the whole question of position of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and I avail myself of this opportunity to make known to you the views of Her Majesty's Govern ment on the subject. The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has protested S. H. 1869, Nos. 58-59. against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British authorities and they have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are undoubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different periods, entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you, that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements sole ly for the purposes of preventing piracy and slave trade and of maintaining the Police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty, but if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties, Her Majesty's Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be en» ccuraged with impunity. I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty's Gov ernment towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah; and in regard to this question I have the honour to state to you that wheresoever it is practicable to do so, Her Majesty's Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein may have rendered necessary. But the British Gorernment cannot consent to debar its officers, to whom the superintendence of the Police of the Persian Gulf is entrusted, from the exercise of the right of punishing, by prompt measures, the Sheikh of Bahrein, on occasions when a reference to the Court of Tehran would be attended with embarassing delays which might endanger the general peace of the Gulf, hut wherever such a necessity shall arise a full communication respecting it shall be made to the Persian Government*', CHAPTER IX. (1) Attack on Bahrein by Mahomed-bin-Khalifa and Nasir-bin-Muba rak.—(2) Murder of Ali-bin-Khalifa.—(3) Measures taken to punish the offenders.-—(4) Esau-bin-Ali proclaimed Chief, 1869. 75. The deposed Chief was forbidden to reside at Bahrein. But in January Political a ., February 1869, Nos. 185-186. f/, 1 at the earnest request of Ali-bin- Knahtah, who believed he could keep a better control over his brother if he resided at Bahrein than elsewhere, Mahomed- bin-Khalifah was allowed to return. He soon, however, began to intrigue, and Ali-bin-Khalifa found it necessary to deport him to Koweit, from which* place he afterwards removed to Katif, in order to be near Bahrein and watch events. 76. In September 1869, however it was reported that Mahomed-bin- Political a., September 1869, Nos. 159 — 164. Khalifa had attacked and plundered Mane- Poiiticai a .. October 1869, Nos. 34~37- meh, one of the principal towns in Bahrein. The facts are briefly the followingMahomed-bin^Khalifa had a relation named [ C 943 FD ] FNassir-bin-Mubarak at Katif, who had married a Bedouin woman of the Howajir tribe, which owned allegiance to the Wahabi Amir, These two wished the Howa^ jir tribe to assist in an attack on Bahrein, but they refused without an order from the Wahabi Amir. Such an order, it was said, Nasir-bin-Mubarak procured during a recent visit to Riadh. This point, however, was not definitely ascertained; and, at any rate, the Amir professed a desire to restrain his subjects from committing aggressions,by sea in accordance with an agreement he entered into in 1866. Be this as it may, Mahomed-bin-Khalifa and Nasir-bin-Mubarak, with a con siderable force of the Howajir tribe (said to be about 500 men), having seized five boats, embarked in these and in four other boats which they had procured and sailed to Bahrein. On landing they marched to Ruffah, a fortress then held by Mahomed-bin-Abdullah, a subject of the Chief of Bahrein, but of doubtful fidelity. In an engagement which ensured between the invaders and Ali-bin-Khalifa, the Chief of Bahrein, which was mainly brought about by the blackest treachery on the part of Mahomed-bin-Abdullah, the Bahrein force was defeated, the Chief Ali-bin-Khalifah, one of his sons, and several other Sheikhs were killed, and the rebels took the two Chief towns of Bahrein, viz., Mahomed and Maharaj. The former town (Mahomed) was given up to plunder, in the course of which no dis tinction was observed between the property of British subjects and that of others. The entire amount of the booty has not been ascertained, but claims have been advanced to the extent of 21,53,797 krans. 77. Thereafter, Mahomed-bin-Abdullah began to play a deep game. He seized Mahomed-bin-Khalifa and threw him frito prison, along with Khalifa, one of his sons. According to the most reliable information, he put Mahomed- bin -Khalifa to death a few days after, his object being to secure the Government of Bahrein for himself. At all events, he ruled in Manemeh for some time, where, however, he had little or no control over the Bedouins. 78. When Colonel Pelly received information of this daring violation of the maritime peace, he sent Captain Way in the Dalhousie to make all possible en quiries at Bahrein and to bring away those British subjects who might wish to leave. Not one of them, however, availed himself of the offer. It appeared that both at Bahrein and the Wahabi port of Katif the plundered property was being openly sold at one-fifth of its value, and the Native British subjects prefered to remain and run all risks, which they had been told would be entirely on their own heads in the hope of picking up the plunder cheap. 79. The punishment wich Colonel Pelly (letter No. 184, dated 5th October s. 1, 1869, Nos^sgo— 304. 1869) suggested was as follows :— ' Firstly, to blockade and otherwise use force against Bahreien until the leaders of the piracy, Mahomed bin Abdullah, Nasir bin Mubarak, also Mahomed bin Khalifab hjmself, supposing him to be still alive, should be surrendered. . 'Secondly, and supposing the choice to be eligible on general considerations, to recog nise the son Esau, of the late Chief, Ali bin Khalifah, as Chief. 8 Thirdly, to come to an understanding with whatever Chief may be recognised to the effect that the estates and other valuable property of the pirates and traitors, Maho med bin Khahfah, Mahomed bin Abdullah, and Nasir bin Mubarak, should be considered as forfeited, and that the produce or value of such property should be applied in the first instance, towards the reimbursement of persons plundered,' except those who have bought plundered property at nominal rates.' 5 41 Fourthly to blockade Katif and other Wahahi ports on the mainland till the plunder ed property there deposited is restored, the invading Bedouins were publicly and severe ly punished, and the Katif Governor was removed in disgrace, . AA LastI y-P e ''? i . n s th f arrival of the Ships, that he should be authorized (by teleffraoh) to address the Chiefs who were parties to the maritime truce and the Wahabi Government letters summarising very briefly what has happened, and intimating the resolve of Govern- ment to punish adequately.' ^ » c =&gt;wivc ui uovern- 80. For the blockade of the Wahabi ports, Colonel Felly considered that two vessels at least would be needed, and one or more light-draughted steam craft, as the port of Katif was not approachable, except to the lightest vessels He also wished the presence of the gunboat Clyde, and he hoped that the Com-* manders of the vessels would receive such instructions that they shall not be bound to quit the Gulf by any specified date.23 8i. The orders of the Government of India were communicated in telegram, No. agg. dated 13th November 1869, to the Govern ment of Bombay. ' Authorize Pelly by telegraph to act in conformity with first of the four recommenda tions made as to punishment in his letter No. 184 of 5th October. His second recommendation as to Esau seems reasonable, and he may act on it if circumstances seem favourable, after he has acted on his first recommendation, and provided he is of opinion that the feelings of the people favour the change. His action on third recommendation must depend on circumstances. As to fourth recommendation, the blockade of Katif and Wahabi ports cannot be decided on until effect of operation at Bahrein is ascertained. Great care should be taken in making any communication to Wahabi Amir, but Trucial Chiefs maybe addressed as suggested. Pelly should as far as possible keep Government informed by telegraph.' No 30I 82. A second telegram of the same date added the following instructions ' Instruct Pelly to notify to the British Minister at Tehran, for the information of the Shah's Government, that under orders from India, he is about to call the chief now in pos session of Bahrein to account for break of the maritime place and unprovoked attack on Ali-bin-Khalifa who was placed in power by British Government. See Secretary of State's despatch No. 5 of 30th April 1869, sent with letter from Government of India, No. 186, dated 7th June. Pelly should state this by telegraph.' 83. The Government of India in confirmation of their telegrams of 13th • November 1869, wrote as follows in letter dated 14th November 1869:— v A telegram, of which I enclosed a copy, has already conveyed to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay the decision of the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council on Colo nel Pelly's proposals. With reference to the telegram of the 12th November from His Excellency the Governor, His Excellency the Viceroy in Council is of opinion that Colonel Pelly's demand for the surrender of the offenders should not be limited to Mahomed-bin- Khalifah, regarding whose fate there appears to be some uncertainty; but must include Nasir bin-Mubarak who aided Mahomed bin Khalifa in the attack on Bahrein, and Maho- med-bin-Abdulla to whose treachery to his Chief the success of the attack is mainly to be attributed. His Excellency in Council gathers from Colonel Pelly's reports that Esau, the eldest son of the late Chief, is at mature age. The proposal to recognise him as Chief in succes sion to his father is reasonable. After the surrender or capture of the three leaders in the attack has been effected, Colonel Pelly may recognise Esau as Chief, if circumstances seem favourable, and if he is of opinion that the feelings of the people are in favour of that course.' But His Excellency in Council is not in a position to pass any definite decision on Colo nel Pelly's proposals to require the Chief whom we may recognise to confiscate the estates and property of the offenders as indemnity to those who have been plundered. The pro priety of such a course must depend entirely on circumstances which cannot at present be foreseen. His Excellency in Council, however, does not think it expedient to demand payment of a fine which, in all probability, could not be paid. As regards the proposed blockade of Katif and the other Wahabi ports, His Excel lency in Council is of opinion that no measures of this kind should be undertaken till the effect of the operations at Bahrein is ascertained. As the fort of Maharaj and the cannon were destroyed last year, His Excellency in Council does not anticipate any serious opposi tion to Colonel Pelly^s proceedings; still His Excellency in Council does not think that Colonel Pelly has sufficient means to carry out operations simultaneously against Bahrein and the Wahabi ports. Moreover, the extent to which the Governor of Katif and the Amir of Riadh are implicated in the attack on Bahrein, and the precise relations of Katif to Riadh, are matters of doubt, and His Excellency in Council desires that the operations against Katif and the other ports be postponed until after the settlement of matters at Bahrein and receipt of a report, which Colonel Pelly can submit by telegraph, as to the necessity of the measure and the complicity of the Governor of Katif in the outrage for which we are exact ing satisfaction. His Excellency in Council has already intimated by telegraph that Colonel Pelly may address the Trucial Chiefs (who it is satisfactory to learn, have shown no disposition to violate their engagements) in the terms suggested in the last paragraph of his letter No. 184, dated 5th October. But in the present uncertainty as to the measures which it may be needful to adopt with respect to the Wahabis, Colonel Pelly will see the necessity of gVeat caution in making any communication to the Wahabi Amir/'€ J'-i! flit II I '[![ i ' i V f ■ : li f yiil: . 24 84. Meanwhile the following telegram dated 12th November 1869, from the Government of Bombay, was received : — ' Lord Clarendon informed Persian Charge that, though we claimed to punish the Chief of Bahrein ourselves if necessary. Government would, if practicable, inform Persian Government of their intention to do so. it will therefore be requisite to telegraph to Charge of Tehran immediately, and this of course comes from the Government of India. Colonel Pelly and Captain Douglas telegraph very important not to await instructions by mail steamer, and I propose to telegraph to him as follows :— Proceed forthwith to Bahrein with Dalhousie, Clyde, and Hugh Rose in company with Daphne and Nymph placing the vessels of this Marine under Captain Douglas' command. Captain Douglas has been requested to take all such measures as he may think necessary, and in concert with him you will demand the immediate surrender of Mahomed-bin-Khali- fah whom you will send forthwith to Bombay. The payment of a sufficient sum as an indemnity for British subjects, those have trafficked in the plunder will not be indemnified. The payment by Mahorued-bin-Abdullah and Nasir-bin-Mubarak each of a sum not less than 5 000 Crown, as a fine for the breach of the maritime truce. Esau, the son of the late Chief, to be recognized as Chief, and payment secured by the two Chiefs above named, and of the Chief of Ruffah of 10,000 Crowns in such instalments as may be possible in three years. Ascertain, if impossible, whether any Persian authority was aware of, or instigat ed, Mahomed's attack. If the above instructions approved, telegraph simple assent im mediately. I should wish to add to the instructions proposed that the amount of fine on Mahomed- bin-Abdullah and Mubarak, and question whether any payment should be made by the three Chiefs as left to Colonel Pelly's discretion, though the latter thought advisable.' 85. The Bombay Government again telegraphed to the Government of India on the 14th November 1869. ' Other instructions sent, but your instructions as to blockade of Wahabi ports not understood. Do you propose to send further instruction when operations at Bahrein known if left to Pelly's discretion. I think question too large, and possible consequences too serious. I think the same as to letter to Amir, if it is to indicate coercive measures against his ports; if only notification suggested in Pelly's (184), and recommended by this Gov ernment three weeks ago, to be made to Amir and Chiefs is meant, it seems too late now ; explicit instructions requested; the demand of surrender of Mubarak and Mahomed-bin- Abdulla, I fear, may possibly be embarrassed and lead to lengthened operations, and on that account preferred heavy fine. Your No. 786 enclosing Secretary of State's No. 5 and your 1029 and enclosures were before me when I telegraphed. As to notification to Persia, it appeared to me mode of notification suggested by Duke of Argyll was not adopted by Foreign Office and think it may give offence to Persia and otherwise undesirable looking to relations between Pelly and Embassy. 86. The reply of the Government of India was telegraphed on 16th Novem ber, which they explained in their letter No. 1613, dated 16th November 1869:— ' In forwarding for record the enclosed copy of a telegram of this date in reply to the telegram from His Excellency the Viceroy of the 14th instant, the Governor-General in Council directs me to explain that he does not take the view put forward in the telegram from His Evcellency the Governor, that the mode of notification suggested by the Duke of Argyll was not adopted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. There is no evidence to show that any substantial difference of opinion existed between the two departments of State ; and in using the term ' Her Majesty's Government/' Lord Clarendon could never have intended that the Viceroy of India was personally to make a representation to the Shah of Persia on such a subject. In fact, as long as the Persian Mission is under the control of the Secretary of Stale for Foreign Affairs and not of the Government of India, such a communication would be hardly suitable. In the absence therefore of any specific instructions, His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council considers it desirable to adhere, as nearly as circumstances will admit, to the mode of communication suggested by the Secretary of State for India in the letter to the Foreign Office of the 21st April. His Excellency the Governor-General in Council is not aware of any serious difference existing between Colonel Pelly and the British Embassy at Tehran. I am further to observe that Mr. Gonne's letter of the 23rd October, No. 454, received here on 8th November, informed the Government of India, the Notification sue^ested in the concluding paragraphs of his letter No. 184, dated the 5th October which appeared to recommend the addresiing by him of the Trucial Chiefs in general and also the Wahabi Government and intimating to both the resolve of Government to punish adequately,'25 ember 7 - 1 ' 116 GoVern0r of Bomba y telegraphed to the Viceroy on . 7 th Nov- still at 'a wishe d to explain why I proposed instructions in the form I did.

The sum result of Colonel Felly's proceedings at Bahrein in November and December 1869 amounted to this— 90. The Fort of Manameh was bombarded and destroyed, and, with the exception of Nasir-bin-Mubarak, who escaped to the mainland, Mahomed-bin- Khalifah, Mahomed-bin-Abdullah, and the leading marauders were captured, and Isa-bin-Ali bin-Khalifah, a son of the late Chief, was installed as Chief, on the understanding that the property of the pirate leaders would be considered as forfeited, and applied in the first instance towards the re-imbursement of the persons plundered. The prisoners, five in number, were taken to Bombay and confined as State prisoners in the Fort of Asirgarh, whence they were afterwards removed to Chunar. Two of them, Nasir-bin-Ahmed and Mahomed-bin-Abdullah, died there, the former in 1873 and the latter in 1877. The remaining three prisoners were in 1887 removed to Aden where, in 1880, two of them were released. The last of the five, Mahomed-bin-Khalifah, was finally external a, may 1887, Nos. 169-207. released in 1887 on the sole condition of residence m the holy cities of Arabia, In 1889 he applied for permission either to return to his native country or for increased External a.

The information about Colonel Felly's proceedings duly reached the Persion protest-1869. ears of the Shah. The Persian Minister Secret Proceedings 1870, N os. 172-177. f or Foreign Affairs, in talking over the events to Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, remarked that the Persian Government had no reason,to feel dissatisfied with the punishment inflicted upon Mahomed-bin-Khalifa for his lawless proceedings at Bahrein, as they were equally interested with the British Government in maintaining the tranquillity in the Gulf, but the Shah objected to a Persian Agent being prevented by the English Resident from landing at Bahrein and communicating with the Chiefs there. About the same time however Colonel Felly intercepted a letter addressed by Hyder Khan, Chief of Dashti to Sheikh Esau (the new Chief of Bahrein), pressing him to place himself under the protection of the Shah. The Government of India held that no action of the Chief of the l74 * Dashti can in any way he recognized as affecting the relation of the British Government with Bahrein.' (Letter No. 562-?., dated 28th March 1870). 92. The following despatches were also addressed by the Government of India to the Secretary of State. (1) Despatch No. 78, dated 22nd February 1870, in which they observed:— ' The Persian Government, we may remark, are at the present moment, powerless to stop disturbances at sea. They have no navy, and even if they were m a position to purchase vessels of war we could not surrender to them the protectorate of the Gulf without the certainty of hostilities, not only with Maskat and the Arab Chiefs of the littoral, who would not tolerate the pretensions of Persia, but also wtth the Wahabis, and probably even wi&lt;.h Turkey, who could with equal show of reason put forward obsolete claims to supremacy) which our position as guardians of the peace of the Gulf alone prevents her from reviving. The obligations, moreover, which we have contracted with the Arab Chiefs to watch over the peace of the Gulf, to put down aggressions by sea, to take all necessary steps for the reparation of injuries inflicted on them, are such as we cannot abrogate. The only security for peace and the safety of trade m these waters lies in our preserving that position which with the consent of the turbu.ent tribes, we somewhat reluctantly took up, which for more than half a century we have, not with out difficulty and at considerable cost, maintained, and which Persia, with her feeble resources, and the scanty respect paid for her by the Arab Chiefs of the littoral, could never assume .'28 The despatch concluded as follows :— Chiefs, Apart from the positive engagements which we have contracted with the Arah and from which it is neither possible nor desirable to recede, the present is not a time when we can encourage the revival of old and unfounded claims such as those which Persia now puts forward. During the years of peace that have followed the establishment of our supremacy in the Persian Gulf Uade has enormously increaied ana the predatory Arabs have embarked in peaceful and mercantile pursuits on the faith of the security which our protactorate affords. British steamers now ply weekly from one end of the Gulf to the other and our subjects have embarked large capital in the pearl fisheries on the coast^ and in the commerce of Mesopotamia,Persia, and Arabia Every day the importance of the Gulf as a commercial highway between Europe and East is increasing, hven if the political engagements which we have contracted admitted of such a course, and Persia were possessed of an adequate naval force it would he almost impossible and certainly impolitic to commit to her the guardianship of these vast and varied interests. Any indication on our part even of a desire to do so would probably be followed by the decline of trade, the outbreak of hostilities, piracy, and plunder, and a return to the disorder and lawlessness which during last half century we have so successf ully restrained. ' (2) In a further despatch, dated the 20th May 1870 (No. 28, Secret) Lord Mayo's Government pointed out that the action of Persia in' regard to Bahrein had had the effect of reviving equally obsolete claims on the part of Turkey, and dccl ired thsveul stutus of the island to he that of ctn ifidBptudant State, subject neither to Persia nor to Turkey, neither to the Wahabis nor yet to Maskat, nor yet to the British Government.' They then went on (para graph 12) :— ' ^ ' We have already, in our despatch of 22nd February so fully explained our position and policy in the Persian Gulf that we have little or nothing to add. JVe can only repeat that our protectorate in the Gulf is a matter of obligation rather than of right • that we have pledged ourselves to the Arab Chiefs who are parties to the maritime peace to watch over the peace of the Gulf, to put down aggressions by sea, and to take all necessary steps for the reparation of injuries inflicted on them; and that from those obligations we cannot, in good faith, recede. Persia has not the means, even if she had the will, to undertake the duty of protecting the peace of the Gulf, She has no naval force. Her interests as the present correspondence so well illustrates, are antagonistic not only to these of the petty Arab Chiefs, but to those of the other great powers whose dominions extend to the shores of the Gulf and the neighbouring seas, and it is our deliberate opinion that even were we prepared to abandon engagements to the oerfor- mance of which British faith is pledged, our withdrawal from o^r^preseit posiLTou d most probably be followed not only by war, but by a return to that state of piracy and dh-ecM^ 1031 ' ^ C0UrSe ^ aCti0n ^ the Gulf haS been 80 suc cessfully ''We cannot too strongly impress upon Her Majesty's Government that there is no Zit nfT^A . rr m Y? tami ' g the P resent state of thin g s an absolute abandon- ment of it, and a withdrawal from the protectorate of the Gulf at the expense of our own The A n rah e r^pft h benefits that have flowed from our policy for the last half century.

If we are no longer prepared to continue the performence of the tasks we have undertaken, we must withdraw altogether; but the consequences of such a step would be so disastrous, not only to our nominal honour, but to the peace of the Gulf, to the prosperity of the tribes inhabiting the littoral, and to the lives and property « P Ur h l] e 5 ' ' durin S ^ P e f e of the 'ast 50 years, have settled on the shores nd embarked enormous capital m the pearl fisheries and the trade with the mainland that we cannot contemplate th.s course as one of the considerations of which Her Maiestv's Government cannot for a moment entertain.'

INTERNATIONAL STATUS AND BRITISH PROTECTION, 1871-1904. C943FD H3° Part II.—International position and British protection, 1854-1904. Chapter XI. Turkish expedition into Nejd, 1871-72. 94. From* the year 1871 the Bahrein affairs get entangled in the complica tions that arose from the Turkish occupation of Hasa, Katif and Bidaa as a result of the expedition into Nejd to assist Abdullah bin Feysal in the civil war between him and his brother Saud for the Amirship of the Wahabi kingdom. The Turks claimed sovereignty over Bahrein as having once formed part of the Waliabi's kingdom, whose Amirs had always acknowledged the Porte as their suzerain. 95. The expedition of the Turks to Nejd began in April 1871. Colonel Pelly, then Resident in the Persian Gulf, was told that if the Arabs took part in the quarrel (between the Turks and the Wahabis) he should limit his aciion strictly to maintaining the maritime peace. He then enquired whether the Government of India desired him to use any influence towards preventing the Trucial Chiefs from aiding the Wahabis against the Turks, or in any way mov ing by sea, and what reply he should give to the Trucial Chiefs if, while continu ing to observe the maritime peace, they asked whether the British Government would protect them against an attack from the Turks by sea. Colonel Pelly also suggested that it would be advisable to intimate to the Turkish authorities our engagements with the Trucial Chiefs, as it was suspected the Turks might have an eye on Bahrein. 96. On 25th April 1871 — ' Colonel Herbert reported a rumour that if the expedition to Nejd was successful, it would eventually be directed to the acquisition of Bahrein, Maskat, and the Arab coast.' 97. On 28th April Colonel Herbert again telegraphed as follows :— ' Ambassador telegraphs repeatedly at my request the following : ' I have positive assurances from the Ottoman Porte that they intend establishing supremacy over Bahrein Maskat, and independent tribes of Southern Arabia, and that no special attack is conteml plated against them.'' 98. Colonel Herbert's telegram of the 25th regarding the rumoured inten tions of the expedition was reported on the 28th to the Secretary of State, who was asked whether an assurance could not be obtained from the Turkish Govern ment that the expedition had no other object than the settlement of the affairs of Nejd. The Secretary of State replied :— ' Her Majesty's Government have received assurances from Constantinople that Turkish Government have no such designs as those mentioned!* 99. To clear up the discrepancy between the information received from Her Majesty's Government and that received from the Political Agent at Bao-hdad Her Maj( s y's An bassador at Constantinople was immediately communicated with by telegraph, both direct and through Colonel Herbert. The result of this reference was that Sir H. Elliot telegraphed on the 12th May Ottoman Porte explicitly denies all intention of extending supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia, and contemplates no attack against them. The sole object of the expedition is declared to be the restoration in Nejd of the tranquillity which is disturbed by the hostility of the brothers, Abdullah and Saud.'' 100. The Grand Vizier communicated these assurances through M. Pisani to Sir H. Elliot:— ' Your Excellency, said Ali Pasha, may give the most positive assurances to Her Majesty's Government that the Porte entertains no intention whatever of ob*ainins&gt; spremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia and docs not contemplate any attack upon them, or harbour any design to subdue them He asserts that the true and sole object of the present enterprize is to pacify the two brothers, to prevent the protraction of disorder, and to restore tranquillity.' 101. Midhut Pasha then at Baghdad also communicated to Colonel Herbert the assurances of the Pone. These assurances enabled the Government • N ote —For a detailed account of the Tumsh expedition into Nejd, see Hasa and Katif Precis (1871-1904)!3 1 of India to give on the i^th May the much required instructions to Colonel Pally, viz., to communicate the substance of Sir H. Elliot's message to the Chief of Bahrein and those of the Trucial Chiefs who had made enquiries regard ing the object of the Turkish expedition. 102. With regard to the general questions put by Colonel Pelly it was said :— He should be informed that it is impossible for His Excellency in Council to give instructions regarding contingencies of the occurrence of which there is no immediate prospect. The Turkish expedition, however, in no way affects the Treaty rights and obligations^ either of the British Government or of the Chiefs who have subscribed to the maritime peace. Colonel Pelly may so inform the Chiefs who tave consulted him, and should use all legitimate means to maintain the stipulations of the Treaties.' 103. Colonel Felly having enquired whether tribes, who are parties to the maritime truce, should be allowed to undertake operations by sea in the interest of either party, he was told on the 30th May to go to Bahrein and there assure the Chief of the assurances given by the Porte ; to inform him that so long as he observed conditions oj Articles 2 and j of the Treaty, our obligations would he fulfilled; to inform all the Chiefs, trucial and others, that the Turkisk Govern ment contemplated no attack on them and had no intention to obtain supremacy over any independent state. 104. With reference to Colonel Felly's enquiry regarding Trucial Chiefs, the Secretary of State was asked :— ' If Felly asks whether he is to stop by force any military operations by sea on part of Chiefs, either for or against Turks, am I to authorize him to do so? 1 advise this course, and that you should inform Turkish Government accordingly. This will not include Koweit Chief who has already sailed.' 105. The Secretary of State replied— ' Persian Gulf trucial Chiefs may be interdicted from maritime operations, but no others.' 106. Thereupon the Bombay Government were directed to inform Colonel Pelly accordingly, and to instruct him to use all the Influence he possessed with the other Chiefs to maintain the maritime truce. 107. The instructions given to Colonel Felly having been communicated to the Forte, AH Pasha expressed his thanks for the communication ; in un equivocal terms repeated his assurances that the Porte contemplated no naval operations, and said that it had no intention of applying for assistance to any of the Chiefs Included in the maritime truce. At the same time the Porte having no cognizance of the truce could not be expected to be held bound by it, and would not hesitate to accept the services of any of the Chiefs who might tender them. 108. Midhut Pasha also again asserted that Bahrein noas not within Tur kish contemplation, and assured Colonel Herbert that his orders to the Officer Commanding the expedition were on no account to turn his eyes on Bahrein. 109. Sir H. Elliot wrote in September 1871 that he had made AH Pasha understand that Her Majesty's Government would not see with indifference any attempt to disturb the arrangements existing with regard to the Arab tribes in the Persian Gulf. no. Again in February 1872 the Secretary of State forwarded papers Proceedings, Sect, May 1872, Nos. 52-S8. r D ece i ; ved , f . ro, ? Corslanti.nople. Server Pasha desired M. Pisam to state that Her Majesty's Government might rest assured that the policy followed previously by the Porte towards the independent tribes along the Persian Gulf had undergone no alteration whatever, and His Excellency asserted again on the part of the Porte that no intention was ever entertained, nor any-design harboured, to sub due those tribes or obtain any supremacy over them. The sole object of the Nejd expedition he stated to have been, and still to be, to restore order and tranquillity there, and establish a regular and cohesive administration more in conformity with the requirements of the country.3 2 m In April 1872 the Bombay Government wrote that they attached no ^ importance to the assurances of the Tur- Proceedings, Secret, May 1872, No. 77. Government as reported in the papers received from Constantinople, as there was no information as to what tribes m the Persian Gulf would be considered by them to be independent, or what they considered to be the limits of the kingdom c&gt;f Nejd. The Government of Bombay thought that some specific declaration as to what the claims were should be at once obtained. The Government of India replied that the assuran ces repeatedly given by the Turkish Government, to the enect that they had no intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, or the other independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, were accepted as satisfactory, and that it was not considered expedient or likely to lead to any good result to ask for a specific declaration of the claims of the Turkish Government. 112 The policy of Her Majesty's Government was laid down in the follow ing despatch, dated'9th May 1872, addressed to the British Ambassador at Constantinople— I have received of late, through the Foreign Office, repeated representations from the Government of India respecting the proceedings of the Turkish authorities in the Persian Gulf, more especially with reference to the increase which the Porte has recently made in the number of vessels employed in those waters. Her Majesty's Government, however, consider that as long as Turkey is engaged in upholding its legitimate authority in the Gulf, they cannot ask it to curtail the means which it considers necessary for doing so, but they may fairly say to the Porte that they trust and expect that no attempt will be made to extend that authority, which would raise questions between the Indian Government and the Porte, the maintenance of the existing state of things in the Gulf and on its borders being considered a matter of great importance to the general tranquillity of those quarters ; and that the presence of large Turkish armaments is generally calculated to disquiet the bordering countries, and must necessarily cause the British Government to take counteracting steps to reassure the public mind. If the presence of an excessive Turkish force requires the Indian Government to in crease the British force in the Gulf, the native mind will see in the latter an encourage ment, not only to resist, but to thwart the Porte, and things will go on from bad to worse, till at last, even in the admitted Turkish districts, a general feeling of uneasiness will be produced, and will cost the Porte more to subdue or mitigate than the country is worth. I have, therefore, to instruct Your Lordship, while expressing to the Porte the views of Her Majesty's Government on this point, to state that they will gladly use their good o|hces to restore peace and bring matters to a normal state of tranquillity.' 113. This despatch was duly communicated to Server Pasha in June 1872, and he repeated the assurance, already so often given, of the absence of all in tention on the part of the Porte of doing more than re-establish their legitimate authority in those districts where their right was undisputed, adding that Her Majesty's Government might be satisfied that since the recall of Midhut Pasha there would be less than ever a disposition to extend the field of operations. 114. Colonel Ross telegraphed as follows in July ' Frequent rumours reach Bahrein of intended move of a Turkish detachment from Nejd to Oman coast It is said their design is to gain footing at Beyranee through con nivance of Chief of Abuthabi. I cannot rely on information as yet received, but have instructed Assistant Resident to use May Frere to ascertain facts. Knowing letters to have passed between Chief of Abuthabi and Turkish authorities, I think it possible he may have made overtures. Possibly Colonel Herbert could ascertain if any extension of Turkish influence eastward contemplated.' 115. In September 1872 the Abuthabi Chief declared his adherence to ^ o v /: Turks. He had previously been inclined Pohtica , ovem er i 72, 03.4- ■ towards the Turks, but on hearing of their proceedings in Katif, Katar, and Hasa he kept aloof and determined to make peace first with the Chief of Debai and then proceed to Maskat to renew friendly relations with Syud Turki. When at Maskat he reported to Colonel Ross (then Political Agent) that he had received a letter from some Turkish authority, couched in vague terms, which he had understood to be an invitation to recognize the Turkish Government as the paramount authority.V 33 116. On the 20th September 1872* Turki himself informed Colonel Pelly • Political a., January 1873, Nos. 265-268. ^ submission of the Abuthabi Chief and the renewal of friendship, and that by gones would be bygones. 117. It thus appears that numerous assurances were given by the Turks that they intended no attack on Bahrein, Maskat, or the independent tribes of South ern Arabia, and that, by the order of the Secretary of State, the Persian Gulf trucial Chiefs were interdicted from maritime operations, while Colonel Pelly was instructed to use all the influence he possessed with the other Chiefs to maintain the maritime truce. 118. Satisfactory as these assurances were, it was soon found that the Turkish Government was bent upon to gain a footing in Bahrein by indirect means, firstly, by encouraging the enemies of the Chief of Bahrein in their intrigues against the island. The principal of these was Nasir-bin-Mobarik, the leading member of the rival branch of the family of the Sheikhs of Bahrein. The Turks also gained over to their side, Jasim, son of Mahomed-bin-Thani, Chief of Bidaa, and employed him as a useful weapon in their anti-British policy in regard to* Bahrein and the Katar and pirate coasts. They tried to incite the tribes on the Katif and Katar coasts facing Bahrein to maintain a hostile attitude against Bahrein and even to make piratical attacks against the island. The Turks further tried to gain a footing at Zobarah, a town on the Katar coast opposite Bahrein, as a place of vantage against the island. When intriguing in this way they took every occasion to protest against alleged acts of British interference in Bahrein affairs, imaginary or real, the latter of which might have been found necessary to enforce treaty obligations of the Chief of Bahrein or to fulfil our treaty obligations to him to defend him against external attacks. C943FD i34 CHAPTER XII. Protest of Porte against certain alleged acts of British sovereignty in Bahrein, 1872-73. 119. In July 1872 the Turkish Government, through their Ambassador in Proceedings, Secret, September 1873, Nos. 248- London, made a friendly representation re* a 5 0 - garding certain acts of sovereignty on the part of the British Government in Bahrein, of which they had received information through the Commander of the Nejd Expeditionary Force. The acts specified were (i) the stationing of 20 English soldiers on the island ; and (2) ' the mark ing out of the limits of the Porte,' whatever this latter complaint meant. The Ambassador had been instructed to remonstrate ' against any encroachment on land which belongs to the Sultan.' 120. The Foreign Office asked the opinion of the India Office as to the reply to be returned to the Turkish Ambassador, and the India Office, while declining to admit the claims of Turkey to sovereignty over Bahrein, requested the Government of India to furnish an explanation regarding the proceedings in question. 121. The Turkish Ambassador, in the course of his representations to the Foreign Office, alluded to a former remonstrance, addressed by him two years ago to Lord Cjarendon, and to which, he said, no reply was received. Apparently the remonstrance alluded to is that treated of in the correspondence contained in our S. H. Proceedings for 1870, Nos. 50-51 and 58-59. In reply to that re monstrance, however, the Porte was distinctly informed that the British Govern ment could not recognize the Turkish claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein. 122. The Bombay Government was addressed and it forwarded a letter from Proceedings, Secret, March 1873, Nos. 122-124. Colonel Ross, Acting Political Resident, Persian Gulf, stating that the acts of sovereignty alleged by the Turkish Government to have been committed by British authorities on the Island of Bahrein were wholly fictitious. Colonel Ross was of opinion that the alarm expressed by the Turkish Government was most likely occasioned by the survey of the Bahrein reefs and anchorage by the Schooner Constance; and he thought that the report of the stationing of twenty English soldiers on the island may have arisen from the circumstance of a party of lascars having been landed for the purpose of measuring base lines on shore in connection with the marine survey. The officers who had been entrusted with ^ the charge of British interests at Bahrein have. Colonel Ross remarked invariably carefully respected the position of the ruler of that island as an independent Chief, and are well aware that any other course would be opposed to the orders of Government. 123. In forwarding Colonel Ross's report to the Secretary of State (Despatch No. 29, dated 4th March 1873) the Government of India stated that it would be perceived from it that there was no ground -whatever for the statement Bahrein Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over A note was accordingly addressed by Lord Granville on ^oth April 187 1 to the Turkish Ambassador.35 CHAPTER XIII. (') Turkish movements in Katar, (') Chief of Bahrein advised to keep aloof from complication in Katar, 1873. 124. There had been at this time rumours of movement of Turkish troops Letter No. 37. dated 16th August 1873. to Ojair from Katif, but Major Grant, Pol a., December 1873, No.412. First Assistant Political Resident, who had been asked to make enquiries, reported to Colonel Ross on 16th August 1873 that the rumour was incorrect and that the fact was that a detachment of some 100 men had embarked at Katif to accompany the Turkish Officer Hossein Effendi to Zobarah on the mainland, some 20 miles south of Bahrein. In a conversation with Major Grant, the Chief of Bahrein claimed the Nairn tribes, living near Zobarah, as his subject under treaty, and stated that when he became Chief of Bahrein, the Chief of the Naim tribe had in Colonel Felly's presence acknowledged subjection to Bahrein under treaty. Major Grant wrote to Colonel Ross that he had no means of forming an opinion on the claim advanced by the Bahrein Chief to sovereignty over the Naim tribe, but from verbal information he inferred that any power exercised by Bahrein of late years over that tribe had betn merely nominal, if it existed at all. In order to obtain more particulars of the alleged intended Turkish ex pedition, Major Grant sent a messenger to Katar, who reported that Hossein Effendi was said to have gone to Zobarah for the purpose of inducing the Chief of the Naim tribe to come under Turkish rule. Major Grant said this was mere coffee-room gossip and nothing new; he advised the Chief of Bahrein to refer to Colonel Ross regarding the claim of the Naim tribes for protection against the Turkish Government. 125. Colonel Ross replied on receiving Major Grant's report that though the matter of sovereignty over Katar had Letter No. 1074—366, dated 28th August 1873. apparently never been formally decided. Pol. a., december 1873, No. 415. ^ authorities in Nejd had established an influence over the Katar Coast as far as the Odeid boundary. He thought the Bahrein Chief had not the power, if he wished, to protect tribes residing in Katar, and that he could not expect Government to interfere where the rights were involved in uncertainty. The Chiefs allied with Bahrein could choose between remaining where they w r ere and removing to Bahrein with the latter's permission. He said that Colonel Pelly had always counselled the Chief of Bahrein to remain strictly neutral under the then existing circumstances, to keep aloof from all complications on the mainland with the iurks, Wahabis, etc , and that the Chief should continue so to act. Colonel Ross desired Major Grant to communicate thus with Bahrein with reference to his appeal for advice, and to dissuade him from acting contrary to it. 126. In writing to Government, Colonel Ross thought that, as the question of sovereign and feudal rights over places lrrA N S;;^ 3 ^rNo 4 4.f 9Ptem ■ and tribes on the mainland of Arabia op- posite to Bahrein, was a complicated one, probably Government would not deem it practicable or expedient to enter into its merits. He said :— 'The question of the sovereignty over Katar generally has never yet been decided It has perhaps been a debateable land between Oman on one side and the Wahabi power on the other. At one time the Chief of Abuthabi is said to have exercised authority in Katar. Later the Utubis having settled there and at Bahrein became paramount. These in turn had to pay religious tithe to the Wahabi Amir, who established a Gover nor of his own at Bidaa. Since the Turkish occupation of El Hassa the whole line of coast as far as Odeid has fallen under Turkish influence and the Chiefs in general have been forced or induced to accept the Turkish flag. Bidaa has been actually occupied and a body of Turkish tioops is now quartered there.' 127. He proceeded to say that in October 1871 Colonel Pelly had obtained permission from the Bombay Government to defer reporting on the question^ of sovereignty over Katar, as there was a probability of the Turks withdrawing from Nejd. He thought the actual position of affairs at Katar did not afford Cause of complaint against the Turkish authorities, but that any move of theTurks fmtuer east than they then were would undoubtedly be an encroachment on Oman territory and would affect ihe Trucial Chiefs. 128. These papers were sent to Colonel Pelly for any remarks he migh have to offer. He replied that it was an old and Letter dited a7th October 1873. somewhat perplexing question. As the Foi. a., December 1873, No. 433. political situation on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf was unchanged since he was asked for his opinion two years previously, he adhered to that opinion, viz., that &lt;( ive should avoid a,% fuv as possible for the present mooting questions of territorial sovereignty'^ He_ allud ed to the repeated written assurances of the Porte that^ it had no intention of interfering with the independence of our trucial Chiefs, a general declaration which would be more valuable than any special definition. The time for effect ively dealing with questions of boundary and supremacy would be when Turkish aggression had taken permanent form or been abandoned. He considered that the Chief of Bahrein should adhere to the arrangements made in 1869, and while acknowledged to possess certain rights of pasturage, etc., on the Katar Coast he should not therefore be held to be empowered to put to sea for the purpose of coercing any port in Katar. He thought Odeid was subordinate to Abuthabi, but that the question should not be touched till the intention of the Turkish Government in striving to occupy the Arabian littoral should be manifested, or if that occupation proved to be part of scheme between Turkey and Russia, the matter might become very grave, for it would mean a dominating influence in the Red Sea and in the Gulfs of Oman and Persia. 129. Meanwhile Colonel Ross reported that on the 2nd September the Letter No. 1191-147, dated 19th September 1873. Chief of Bahrein again asserted his sover- Poi. a ., December, p. 421. eignty over Zobarah and the Nairn tribe under treaty, and aske4 whether he should relinquish them or allow them to remain as they were. Major Grant after consulting the treaties (Vol. VII, Nos. 72 and 73) had arrived at the conclusion :— 'That there is no special mention made in the Treaties of El Naim or of Zobarah, .. , though in Article I of No. 72 there is mention made of the dependencies of Bahrein, though it is not stated what those dependencies are. ' From what I have heard whilst living in Bahrein, I should say that some years ago the Nairn, together with many other of the Guttur tribes, were in certain way dependencies of Bahrein; but the amount of authority exercised by the Rulers of Bahrein over Katar seems to have varied in proportion to the power of coercion those Rulers possessed : if the Chief of Bahrein was strong, the tribes acknowledged his supremacy, if he was weak, they denied it.' Colonel Ross requested Major Grant to be guided by his former letter, dated 28th August 1873 (Fide para. 125 ante). 130. Colonel Ross's letter of 28th August was approved by the Government Government of India letter No. 2829-P., dated ^ India and he Was furnished With a Copy I7 th December ISjs. of Colonel Pelly's letter of 27th October. ., ecem er, o. 42 anc j j n f orme( j His Excellency in Council concurred generally in the views therein expressed, and that it was desirable that the Chief of Bahrein should^ as fur as practicable ) ah stain from interfering in complications on the mainland.37 CHAPTER XIV. Proceedings of a British vessel towards the Turkish Ship ' Assour ' 1873. 131. On the 10th January 1874, the Acting Political Resident in the Political b., January 1874, Nos. 203-204. Persian Gulf forwarded a codv of a tele- Pohtical A., June 1874, Nos. 48-S4. U 1 • . VT . . . ~ 1 • u a 1 • graph correspondence with the Political ^ ge , n . , in £ urklsh Arabia regarding an accusation which had been made by some 1 urkish ofhcer against the British officials at Bahrein of their havincr sunk a Bahrein vessel for supplying water to the Turkish steamer Assour. Colonel Herbert stated that there was no foundation for such a preposterous report. 132. In the month following we received from the India Office a copy of a Secret, March 1874, Nos. 174-175. correspondence with the Foreign Office in &gt; connection with the same subject, and the attention of the (jovernment of India was invited to the concluding portion of Sir John Kaye's letter of the loth February, which was to the effect that the matter would be brought to the notice of the Viceroy ' for such enquiry as the meagre particulars at the time forwarded may enable him to institute.' A copy of this despatch was duly forwarded on 21st March to the Docket No. 727 p., dated 21 St March 1874. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for report, but apparently before it could reach him Colonel Ross sent us a copy of a letter which he had addressed to -Admiral Gumming in the matter, and of its enclosures, which show that there was no vessel of the Royal Navy at Bahrein on the 22nd August 1873, the date of the alleged disturbances, except the May Frere, belonging to the Bombay Marine, and the Survey Schooner Consicmcc ; that Major Grant, the first Assistant Resi dent, was present at Bahrein about this period, and that he was wholly unaw r are of any dispute ever having occurred. Colonel Ross observed that it was very strange that, although the matters complained of occurred in August, neither the British Representative in Turkish Arabia nor the Consul at Basrah heard of them until the month of January following. He added that this was not the first occasion that complaints had been preferred against British officers, which on enquiry have turned out to be untrue, and that this fact strengthened the pre sumption that the present accusation is simply a malicious falsehood. I 34- Since the receipt of the above letter, Colonel Ross replied to our letter Letter dated 17th April 1874, Nos. 507-10. ^ 21 st March. He referred to the correspondence previously forwarded, and stated that since writing to Admiral Cumming he had gathered the followino- particulars from Major Grant. 135. When the Commander of the Assour informed the Chief of Bahrein that he wished to publish in the town that he was ready to take passengers at a lesser rate th3.n the mail steamers, the Chief consulted Major Grant, who sssured him in reply that there was no objection, and advised him to give 'the Turkish officials all facilities. The notice was then, it is said, proclaimed in the bazaar by beat vi tom-tom, but no passages could be obtained as the inhabitants placed little faith in the Turkish steamer. 136. Colonel Ross added that it had invariably been the rule with Political Officers in the Gulf— 'To counsel the Chief of Bahrein and any other friendly Chiefs who seek advice to be particular to show civility and politeness to Turkish officials '— and he showed the very great inaccuracies contained in M. Dominici's report which Page 2 of Secret Proceedings, March 1874, Nos. appeared to have been accepted by the . l74 ' I7S '. . Ottoman authorities without the slightest investigation. Colonel Ross hoped that such notice might be taken of this un founded complaint by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council as would lead to prevent a recurrence of such extremely insulting accusa tions on the part of Turkish officials against British officers. The papers were forwarded to the Secretary of State for the information and orders of Her Majesty's Government (Despatch No. 91, dated 2nd June 1874). [c943 fd ] k38 CHAPTER XV. I Petitions of Nasir bin Mobarik and his relatives to the Grand Vizier, 1872-74. 137. Another pretext for interference in Bahrein affairs was furnished to the Turks by the proceedings of Nasir bin Secret, June 18,2, No. 128. Mobarik, the leading member of the rival branch of the family of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and his relatives. In April 1872 he was reported to be living with the Governor of Lahsa on a pension granted him by the Tuskish Government and to have petitioned the Porte to the effect that half Bahrein belonged to him. Shortly afterwards another member of the family, Ahmed bin Nasir bin Abdullah, nephew of the ^-Sheikh of Bahrein, proceeded to Baghdad with, it was stated, a letter from Fereek Pasha recom mending that he should be granted letters of naturalization as a Turkish subject, T , 0 XT and it was supposed that he would then Political A., Julv 1873, No. 103. , rir , endeavour to recover the property at Bahrein belonging to his uncle and father. The Sheikh of Bahrein alarmed at this, consulted the British authorities in the Persian Gulf, and the Resident issued the following instructions to his Assistant :— 'In case Ahmed bin Nasir prefers claims to the Chief of Bahrein as an Arab suitor simply, the Chief would of course be able to dispose of the case according to the fact and no reference to British authority would be necessary. ' If again he appeared in the character of a newly-made Turkish subject or protege, or with letters of recommendation from that Government, this would in nowise impair the Chief's right as an independent Ruler to dispose of the claims. It would, in this case, however, be necessary for the Chief to be most careful and guarded, so as to avoid making any admissions to the Turkish authorities, and at the same time to avoid giving unnecessary offence. Appeal to British authorities would still be unnecessary, and should not, except in extreme cases, be resorted to. ' Any attempt by the Turkish authorities to interfere actively in Bahrein in support of Ahmed bin Nasir, or any persons or factions in that island, would of course be to raise the question of sovereignty. In such event the Chief would doubtless count, as hitherto, on the mediation of the British Government. ' Sheikh Esau should be both guarded and courteous in his communications with Turkish authorities, which he should invariably bring to the knowledge of Government.' , 138. These instructions were approved by the Government of India. It Political A., July 1873, No. 104. was the general impression on the island that lurkey would try to establish a right to interfere in the affairs of Bahrein by supporting the claims of the faction who had murdered the late Chief. 139. On the 12th April 1879 another petition was sent to the Grand Vizier Political a., November 1874, Nos. 171-199. 'y ^rkey by Nasir Mobarik, Suleman Khahfah, Mobarik bin AH, and Hanu Khalifeh, styling themselves Sheikhs of Bahrein. In this petition it is said amon^ other things— It is needless to recall the fact that the isle of Bahrein and its surroundings form part of the Ottoman Empire under the protection and rule of our august Khalif the Sultan etc., etc. We openly declare that there is no bond of union between us and the British Government to which we are forced to be subject; and convinced as we are that the said Government has no right to exercise a vexatious authority over us, we acknowledge that His Imperial Majesty the Sultan alone enjoys the absolute right to punish us, should we act in opposition to his Imperial will. We regret extremely 'to see that the British Consul ventures to expel us from our native soil into the adjacent districts, banish in exile to India Mahomed bin Khalifeh, and Mohamed bin Abdullah bin Khalifeh who are reckoned amono- the most respectable members of our tribes, and to confiscate their property. ' 0 ' SuC j P roce ®di n gs being in the highest degree unjust and unreasonable, we beg humbly and repeatedly that Your Highness will so arrange that we may return to om country, we as well as those who are exiles in India, and that the property confiscated at Bah- rein, be restored to us.' r ^ ^ «at iJdu 140. This petition was taken up by Aarif Pasha as though the matter to which it referred were something quite new, and a striking illustration of the high handed proceedings of British authorities. On 24th June he wrote to Musurus Pasha calling attention to Lord Granville's note to the Turkish Ambassador39 dated 30th April 1873, in which contradiction was given to the rumours that British authorities had attempted to assert sovereignty over Bahrein, and stating that these assurances had been dispelled by the encroachments of the British which were arousing great discontent among the islanders. The letter goes on— At the instance of the memorialists, and taking my stand at the point of view which the Sublime Porte has maintained from the outset regarding Bahrein in respect to proceed ings and pretensions inconsistent with the rights of our august master over that island. I beg Your Excellency to take fresh measures to obtain from the British Government redress for the grievances set forth below and to secure at the same time a cessation of the state of things which gives rise to them.' 141. The purport of the above letter was communicated by Musurus Pasha to Lord Derby, who replied that Her Majesty's Government disclaimed the exercise of any sovereign rights over Bahrein which they regarded as indepen dent, and as to allegations of acts of violence committed by the British Consul, he thought there must be some mistake ; but would enquire. 142. The correspondence was then referred to the India Office, who replied that enquiry would be made of the Government of India ; but it was added that the Marquis of Salisbury thought it might be expedient to state to the Turkish Minister that the assumption of the petitioners as to Bahrein being under the sovereignty of the Porte is one which Her Majesty's Government have persis tently declined, and still refuse to admit. 143. The Secretary of State sent the correspondence to this Government remarking that apparently one at least of the petitioners, Nasir bin Mobarik, was a ringleader in the disturbances of 1869, and that the subject matter of the petition referred to events of that year. 144. The Government of India addressed as follows to the Secretary of State (No. 191, dated 23rd October 1874)— The complaints of the petitioners refer to the proceedings of the Resident in the Persian Gulf in connection with the disturbances of 1869 ; a review of the circumstances attending which will be found in our despatch No, 24, dated 16th November 1869, and subsequent despatches. * The petitioner, Nasir bin Mobarik, was one of the persons chiefly concerned in the attack on Bahrein in 1869. After the disturbances he fled with his followers to the territo ries of the Wahabee Amir. We have no definite information regarding the three other petitioners, Suleman Khalifa, Mobarik bin Ali, and Hamid Khalifa. But they are pro bably members of the exiled or Abdullah branch of the ruling family of Bahrein, who lately, in conjunction with the Beni Hajir tribe, threatened an attack on the island. Mohamed bin Khalifa and Mohamed bin Abdullah, alluded to by the petitioners, are the persons whose arrest was reported to Her Majesty's Government in paragraph 2 of our despatch No. 42, dated 14th December 1869. The former is the brother of the Chief, Ali bin Khalifa, who was killed in the attack on Bahrein in 1869, and the latter was not only one of the principal leaders in that attack, but is a man of more than ordinarily intriguing and dangerous character. On a recent occasion, when fresh disturbances were threatened by Nasir bin ♦Letter to the Political Resident, No. 1450-?., Mobarik, we informed the _Political Resident in dated 7th July 1874. Persian Gulf that it was in our opinion highly (No. s of Abstract of Contents.) desirable that the Chief of Bahrein should learn to relv on his own resources for the maintenance of his position; due respect, however, being had to his claims to the support of the British Government under the terms of the Treaty of 1861, by which we have engaged under certain circumstances to protect Bahrein from attacks by sea directed against it by Chiefs or tribes of the Persian Gulf. The correspondence which we enclose will show that attacks on Bahrein have of ^ , , ,, , £ r . . x late been threatened by parties of the Beni Hajir (N01. 6 and 7 of Abstract o!

In our despatch No. 173, dated 22nd September, we suggested that if the tribe be under the authority of Turkey^ 4 they should be restrained by the Government of the Sultan. At the same time we have f r* l \ instructed the Resident in the Persian Gulf to (No. 8 of Abstract of Contents.) take e( i ectivf steps to protect the island from attack ; but, as far as possible, to limit his interference in the affairs of Bahrein and of the Arab Chiefs on the coast, to protecting the legitimate interests of British subjects, maia- taining our Treaty rights, and fulfilling our Treaty obligations.40 We need scarcely remind Your Lordship that, •while we make no claim -whatever to sovereignty over Bahrein, we can recognize no such claims as those put forward in Arifi Pasha's letter to Musurus Pasha, dated 24th June, enclosed in your despatch under acknowledgment, and that no admissions or statements made by Nasir bin Mobarik and his fellow petitioners, who are rebels against the Government of Bahrein and exiles from the island, can affect the question of the status of Bahrein and our Treaty relations there with. 145. if we may anticipate events, it may be mentioned here that Nasir 17 ^ 1 a 0 m „ fr' Mobarik submitted a memorial on External A., May 1890, Nos. 101 &gt;104. uu similar lines m 1890 to the Mutassarif of Hasa and appealed for the Porte's interference with a view to his being restored his family estates, which had been confiscated by the Chief of Bahrein. 1 *I 42 ■ 111 150 . „ a.

In forwarding copy of this telegraphic correspondence to the Secretary of State, the suggestion was made that &gt; . . ^ (&lt; The circumstances reported by Colonel Ross should be communicated to the Govern- f , q Kijm^ Pnrte through Her Majesty's Minister at Constantinople, who nug t ment of th t e S'bUme Porte throug^ of Turk the shollld bt restrained ^y the Government of the Sultan. If, however Bahrein is attacked, action on the part of the British authorities in repelling the tribe will not be delayed. ^ ,&lt;2. In a letter, dated 12th September 1874, the Resident reported in more detail the proceedings of the Bern Hajir Pol. a ., November 1874, Nos. 171.199- anc i ^eir defeat at Zobarah by the Naim tribe whose Chief was a kind of feudatory of the Sheikh of Bahrein. The more important portions of his letter relate to the alleged countenance afforded them by Bezech, the Turkish Governor of Hasa, in this raid: from two independent sources it was reported that his Agent, one Nasir bin Jubr bin Salina, had influenced and abetted the tribe in their lawless aggressions and had accompanied them towards Zobarah. Ihe Resident added-- Considering the lawless nature of the object of the Beni Hajir, and their having engaged in open piracy on the sea, it might be deemed advisable to enquire from the Turkish Government as to the part taken by this Agent in the aggressive and piratical proceeding reported. ik * Commenting on our obligation under the Treaty of 1861 to prevent and employ force against aggressive enterprises of this nature, he noted as one of our preventive measures the assistance of the various chieftains of the Katar Coast who it was understood, were held responsible in these matters for their immediate coast line. This responsibility the Chief of Bidaa, or at any rate his son, Jasim bin Mahomed, was prepared to evade on the plea that they were under Turkish influence. ' It is, therefore, now, I think, a matter for considera tion whether the Turkish Government should not be asked to state clearly tor what portions of the coast they undertake to be responsible.' The Resident also mentioned the insecurity of the Chief of Bahrein's position owing to the enmity of the other branch of the family, the secret sympathy of the Turks, and his own want of conciliation towards the Arab Chiefs and others as a reason for anticipating an early change in the position of affairs. 154. In reply to these letters the Government of India (letter No. 3300 P., dated 21'st October 1874) instructed him not to hold communications with the local Turkish officials regarding Bahrein. ' Anv necessary representations can, under present circumstances, be made with more effect through Her Majesty's Ambassador at No. 157 of Proceedings cited. Constantinople under instructions from the Sec retary of State for Foreign Affairs, Interference in the affairs of Bahrein and of the Arab Chiefs on the Coast should, as far as practicable, be limited to protecting the legitimate interests of British subjects, maintaining our Treaty rights, and performing our Treaty obligations. When these are affected it will be proper to take steps to put matter right; otherwise the less interference you exercise the better.' 155. The defeat of the Beni Hajir by the Naim tribe apparently dis couraged the former from attempting any further warlike movements, and seven of them were said to have been arrested by Jasim bin Mahomed for plundering a Bahrein boat, in which he had a considerable sum of money, but the Turks took43 advantage of these disturbances to send their gun-boat, the Iskenderia, to the Katar Coast apparently to make enquiries concerning them ; the result being that her Commander seemed to have taken the Chiefs of Bidaa and the Agent of the Government of Lahsa to task for their share in causing them. 156. Nasir bin Mobarik soon afterwards left A1 Hasa and arrived on the Katar Coast, where his presence could not fail to cause additional anxiety as regards Bahrein. He wrote to the Resident stating that he had been for the last six years deprived of his just rights in Bahrein which was the property of all his family, and begging that the British Government would not prohibit his getting these rights. The Resident in reply told him that any attempts at aggression would meet with the active opposition of the British Government. He found that the Chief of Bahrein was in a state of anxiety about the presence of Nasir bin Mobarik on the Katar Coast, and the possibility of his receiving assistance from the Chief of Bidaa and the Katar people generally in an attack on Bahrein:— 'Sheikh Esau in dwelling on the danger to his Government from the propinquity of Nasir bin Mobarik, expressed his desire that I should take steps to prevent the Katar Chief harbouring him or assisting him in any operations against Zobarah by land or sea. I informed the Chief that I could not undertake to interfere except to repress movements by sea- The Chief of Bahrein being apprehensive of an attack on his allies, and as he consi ders, subjects, who hold the fort of Zobarah, asked whether he would be allowed to re inforce the garrison of that place, which he considered a dependency of Bahrein. Sheikh Esau necessarily relies much on the Naim tribe of Zobarah, who came to his aid in his late dangers, and if he were to be deprived of their support, his means of detence would be greatly weakened. A refusal on his part to aid the Naim garrison of Zobarah if attacked by other Arab tribes of Katar would undoubtedly lose the friendship of that tribe for Sheikh Esau. ' My reply to the Chief was to the effect that I would as before advise him as far as possible to keep free of the feuds on the mainland. That as regards saccouring Zobarah I would not interfere with the despatch of reinforcements as a purely defensive measure; but that it was for the Chief himself to judge as to the necessity for, or expediency of, the measure. I likewise enioined him to carefully abstain from taking any part in the opera tions in which the Turkish Government were engaged.' 157. The Resident was informed by telegram that if the Chief took any part in complications by land. Government would not guarantee him protection. More detailed instructions were sent by post to the following effect The Governor-General in Council observes that by the correspondence marginally , . _ . noted, it was shown that the Chief of Bahrein r^h 5 aTrf* ^ ^ 41 eptem er 1 73, para bad no possessions on the nxiinland of Katar, g No. 1191—147, dated 19th September 1873, para- and that his rights thert were of a very un- graph 7 ante. certain character. Accordingly in the letter from this office to your address, No. 2829-?., dated 17th December 1873, you were informed that it was desirable that the Chief should abstain, as far as practicable, from interfering in complications on the mainland. 'His Excellency in Council, therefore, considers that the Chief of Bahrein should not have been encouraged to despatch troops to the mainland for the reinforcement of his allies the Naim tribe. On the contrary, he should be advised to rely for support on the assistance of the British Government, which will, if necessary, be given him either to repel attacks by sea or to frustrate a threatening movement from the mainland. ' It should be clearly pointed out to the Chief that so long as he adheres to his treaty obligations, the British Government will protect him; but if such protection is to be accord ed to him, he must not be the aggressor or undertake measures, which will involve him in complications and which are consid red inadvisable by the British Government.'44 CHAPTER XVII. (i) Complaints of Turkey about Chief of Bahrein's encroachments in Katar, (2) the Chief again advised to avoid being involved in complications on the mainland, 1874-1875. 158. In his letter No. WA dated 16th December 1874, Lieutenant-Colonel Ross reported;— Pol. A., February iS 7 &lt;, No. 81. .. ' Fr0m Col0ne, communications and the accompaniments, it appears that the Wali of Baghdad has telegraphed to the Ottoman Porte complaining— -That the Chief of Bahrein had acted against the Turkish Government in several instances. That a British vessel had attacked the Beni Hajir tribe and killed twenty-two persons. This latter statement is of course mere fiction. The proceedings of the Hugh Rose No 1039—209, dated 12th Seprember 1874, and vess ^ evidently referred to, were merely as accompaniments, psragraph 13 ante. reported in my letter as per margin, and occa sioned no loss of life whatever. &amp; ■ against the Chief of Bahrein in this instance are that he Zobarah ' attacked bythe Beni Ha i ir ' and als0 'paired the fort of of importance is of course not so much what the proceedings of the Sheikh of Bahrein were, as whether his proceedings under the circumstances of the case could be fairly viewed as hostile to the furkish Government. stsatKa 1 *— - fc -«««««&amp;« ' It will be observed that the complaints of the Turkish Governor -General ar P fale premises ^ theSe P01n,S ' In fact a conclusion is nought to be drawn from ed been subject.

' I would also take leave to point out that the presence of Nasir bin Mobarik on the sea coast as a pyotcj^c of the Turkish authorities is a standing menace to the existing Government of Bahrein. That individual has been considered by the British Government as a pirate and enemv, and it would perhaps not be thought unreasonable to demand that he should be restrained from acting against interests which the British Government is con cerned with. ' The chief cause of embarrassment as regards the maintenance of peace and neutra' litv by sea between Bahrein and Katar lies in the present uncertainty as to the question with whom responsibility rests. The various mainland Sheikhs may shelter themselves under Turkish protection, whilst the latter power has not formally assumed Government duties. Were the responsibilities more decidedly fixed the constant inconvenient anxiety about Bahrein would disappear/ icq. On the same date Colonel Ross reported to Government (No. 1433— 306, dated 19th December &gt;874) the reply Political A, 1'ebruary 1875, Proceedings No. 323. ^ Cfaef of Bahrein to the communica tion of Government of India's telegram of 10th December, in which he stated that the object of his sending help to Zobarah was to defend his own island, not to encroach on his neighbours, and intimated his readiness to be guided by the policy of Government. 160. Colonel Ross reported on 3rd April 1875 (No. 407—107) that the Chief i87S of Bahrein persisted in declaring the whole of Katar to be subject and tributary to Political A, May 1875, N09. 354-365. Bahrein. In paragraph 2 of letter No. Political A, May 187s, No. 363. 1 342 -P., dated loth May 1875, Colonel Ross was directed to Inform the Chief that— (( His Excellency in Council observes with regret that the Chief still manifests a dis position to entangle himself in the affairs of the mainland of Katar. He should now be made clearly to understand that if he persists in a course opposed to the advice oj the Government of India and is thereby involved in complications on the mainland, the consequences will be upon himself, and that the British Government will hold themselves free to take such measures with respect to him as they may think necessary.' 161. The purport of this letter was conveyed to the Chief by Lieutenant Eraser, Political Assistant, in person. In reply, the Chief stated that he under stood ' the orders of Government to prohibit Interference on the mainland and specially at Zobarah.' He added that he had obeyed the order-— « rea son of our not interfering in the affairs of Zobarah at this time is simply obe dience to the orders of Government, not that our rights have become invalid or extinct.' 162. At the same time he sent his brother to make the following requests to Colonel Ross:— ' 1 That the evacuation of Zobarah should be delayed till after the pearl fishery season, as during this time all the trustworthy adherents of the Sheikh were absent, and the island was peculiarly liable to attack. Colonel Ross replied that he could not countenance any further delay in withdrawing from Zobarah. « 2 a yessel-of-war might remain continuously at Bahrein. This Colonel Ross declined to promise during the hot season, though he added that cruisers should visit the island as often as possible, and prompt assistance be afforded in case of attack. « V That Zobarah might be restored some time or other. On this point Colonel J ' Ross did not think that the British Government Political A., September 1875, Nos.34-39- would alter their decision. In reporting* the • No. 667—171, dated Bashire, a8th June 1875. above Colonel Ross pointed out that the words 'prohibit ' and ' Government order ' were the Chief's own choosing, and he expressed the opinion that any attempt to explain the difference between advice and order would probably unsettle the Chief's mind and weaken the effect Political A., September 1875, No. 39- 0 f the intimation already conveyed to him. The f No aiSi-P., dated Simla, sth August 1875. proceedingst of Colonel Ross were approved.' [C943FD] L46 CHAPTER XVIII. Proceedings of Abdul Rahman bin Feysal and charge of harbouring him against Chief of Bahrein, 1874-75- 163. Abdul Rahman bin Feysal, Saud's younger brother, landed at Bahrein on his release from surveillance at Baghdad Enclosure No. 8 to No. aao to Secretary of state, in August i8'74» there remained about two dated uth December 1874. months quietly, taking no part in the affairs of that island, but as the distracted state of Nejd compelled him to be cautious in venturing among the Nejdian tribes, he sent messengers to the Coast at Ojair to ascertain their feelings which he found to be generally in favour of Saud. The Governor of Katif either took alarm or pretended to do so at the,, enquiries made by Abdul Rahman's messengers and perhaps at the attitude of the tribes friendly to Saud bin Feysal. He conse quently addressed the following letter on 20th October 1874 to the Chief of Bahrein:— ' I have received intelligence that in these days Abdul Rahman al Feysal and Fahad bin Sinthan are at Bahrein, and their wicked thoughts prompt them to create disturbances against the Turkish Government, and their conduct also tends towards rebellion, that you are assisting them in making preparations by gathering 4 or 500 rebellious men. Let this, then be known to you that it it be prove-J to us that you are helping or preparing any vessels or doing the most trivial thing which will be a help to them to carry on their weak designs, be sure that you will be taxed by the Turkish Government for ever) thing that might happen. It was therelore necessary that 1 should warn you in writing, through Hassan Effendi, an officer of the Imperial troops. As soon as you are informed you are instantly required to tell us whether you wish to be at war with the Turkish Government, or not. We have given injunctions to this officer not to remain more than one dav with you for your reply as to your resolutions that we might know how to act accordingly.' 164. The Chief of Bahrein was averse to answering this letter, as he had Enclosure No. 7 to No. 222 to Secretary of state, verbally informed the messenger who dated 18th December 1874. brought it that he had referred the letter to the British representative ; he wished moreover to avoid corresponding with the Turkish authorities. He averred that he had given Abdul Rahman and his relative Fahad no assistance whatever, but had merely treated them with the Enclosure No. 8 to No. 220 to Secretary of State, Ordinary COUrtCSy due to VISltOrS, The dated nth December 1874. Resident thought it was not improbable that an attempt would be made, though unjustly, to saddle the Bahrein Chief with responsibility for the after proceedings of Abdul Rahman who left Bahrein with his followers three days after the receipt of the Governor of Katif's letter and landed near Ojair. He proposed therefore to visit Bahrein and advise the Chief to send a polite reply to that letter disclaiming responsibility for Abdul Rahman's proceedings, and expressing his desire and intention to avoid any pro ceedings which could justly give offence to the Turkish Government. He would also take the opportunity of repeating the counsel so often given to the Chief to keep clear of complications on the main land and to observe a conciliatory behaviour in every respect. This proposal met with the approval of Govern ment : the Resident was further directed to ascertain and report whether Abdul Enclosure No. 9 to No 220 to Secretary of State, Rahman S followers Came With him from dated nth December 1874. Baghdad or were collected at Bahrein, what was their number, and whether they were armed. Abdul Rahman had no sooner landed at Ojair than he prepared to harass the Turks, as is shown by the accompanying telegrams from the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia and the Resident in the Persian Gulf respectively— 'Fresh disturbances occurred in Nejd. One regiment infantry left Basrah for Katif on the I2th, and another regiment with 150 policemen started hence this morning.' ' Bush're, i8tb. —Consequent on report that the Wahabi Prince Abdul Rahman bin Feysal has cut communication between Katif and El Hassa, Turkish authorities are sending two infantry regiments by sea to Katif with squadron of four vessels. Troops also preparing to march to Nejd by land. Turkish authorities blame Chief of Bahrein's conduct regarding Abdul Rahman. Have reported by letter dated 31st October on this complaint. '165.

(i) Fortifications at Manamah on the Island of Bahrein, (2,) The Porte's project to erect a lighthouse at Manamah, 1875. 168. In July 1875 the Ambassador at Constantinople reported that the Tur kish Government had brought to his notice Secret, January 1876, Nos. 125-130, ^ f or tificauons were being erect ed at Manamah, which was represented as a ' dependency cf Bahrein ' by the English, as it was stated. The Porte appeared to think that the buildings when completed would— ' in all probability be resorted to for protection and security by the Arab insurgents of the Nejd who resist the sovereign authority.' ' Manamah ' or ' Mename' is situated in the island of^ Bahrein. Colo nel Ross, in his Administration Report of the Persian Gulf Residency for 1874- 75 (page 3), sa y s — '' The trade and wealth of Bahrein are centred in its two principal towns, Menamah a nd Moharak, and these places being destitute of walls and fortifications, and the Chief, Sheikh Esau, having neither armed men in his service (beyond a small bodyguard) nor munitions of war, they appear an easy and tempting prey to any w'andering horde of Bedouins who may be able to obtain craft of light draught suitable to the shallow waters That surround the island, and then, landing unobserved, to indulge in indiscriminate pillage.' Colonel Ross clearly thought that it is more the object of the Arabs to keep the Bedouins of the mainland out of the place, rather than to tempt them to make it a refuge. 169. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, was addressed, No. 1291—297, dated 4th December 1875 and in reply, stated that in May or June 1875 the Chief of Bahrein repaired a fort situated on Manamah, the principal island of the Bahrein group. The Resident; believed that the object of the Chief in repairing the fort was to strengthen his position against piratical raids from the mainland and to have a convenient place of refuge during alarms. No reference on the subject was made by the Bahrein Chief (on whose territory the fort is built) to the Resident, and the proceeding was deemed by him a natural and proper pre caution. Colonel Ross added that— ' No British officials or persons whatever were engaged on the repairs or concerned with the work in any way.' 170. While protesting against fort at Manamah being repaired, suspecting Political A, September 1875, Nos.68-70, and De- that the British were at the bottom of this camber 1875, Nos. &gt;4. project, the Porte had in view to erect a lighthouse at the same place. It was Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran that first heard of this Turkish project, and in communicating the news to the Foreign Office, and the Government of India, observed that, if carried out, it was likely to lead to serious complications. The Foreign Office thereupon instructed Sir A. Elliot, (British Ambassador at Constantinople) to endeavour to dissuade the Porte from carrying out this intention, which if persisted in, might result in serious complications.' The Turkish Government then gave up the project in contemplation.49 CHAPTER XX. (i) The Beni Hajir attack Zobarah and commit piracies, (2) The Chief of Bahrein retaliates, 1875. 171. On the 20th February 1875 (No. 133) Colonel Ross reported that the * No. 210, dated Bahiein, April 1875. Bern Hajir were moving in 1 he direction of Political a., June 1875, Nos. 209-212. Zobarah. Later* on, information was re ceived that the Beni Hajir had been attacked by the Nairn tribe who carried off some head of cattle ; whereupon the Beni Hajir retaliated by attacking Zobarah and also making off with certain plunder. So far Sheikh Esau kept himself aloof from any participation in the quarrel, but in August of the same year having been informed by his pearl divers that some of the Beni Hajir had ' em barked in a boat with the intention of disturbing the peace at sea and committing acts of piracy,' he despatched five armed vessels of his own to pursue the offenders to 4&lt; Khor Fush,' a creek near Shargah about 250 miles from Bahrein. Colonel Ross disapproved of the action of the Chief on this occasion, and pointed political a., October 1875 Nos. 15-18. out to him in a lettcrf that the circum- t No. 356, dated 34th August 1875. stances of the case in no way necessitated the measures taken, and that the use of armed boats should be strictly confined to the defence of Bahrein and its waters. The Government of India, while approving of Colonel Ross's proceedings, thought it advisable to ' use even firmer language to Sheikh Esau, who had lately shown a disposition to be very political a., october 1875, No'ms-i 9 . aggressive.' Colonel Ross was according- + No. 371 i-p., dated Simla, 7th October 1875, \y instructed j to remind. ' Sheikh Esau of his Treaty engagements in respect to acts of aggression or retaliation by sea, and to warn the Chief in plain language that if he violated those engagements, he cannot remain a friend of the British Government ' 172. But before this letter reached Colonel Ross, he had deputed Lieutenant Fraser to Bahrein to enquire into the facts of the pursuit of the Beni Hajir. The Chief threw the responsibility on his brother Ahmed, who he said had insti gated the pursuit and then carried it out against his (the Chief's) wishes. In a Political A., November 1875, Nos. 281-290. subsequent letter§ the Government of India f No. 3143 dated 30th November 1875. drew the attention of Colonel Ross to the error committed by Sheikh Ahmed which had led to a violation of the Treaty stipulations, and he was desired— ' to place the matter before the Chief in such a light, as would leave no room for further misapprehension,' 173. In July 1876 the Resident, Persian Gulf, reported that the Beni 1876. Ha i ir tribe had split up into two factions, 1 Political A., September 1876, Nos. 218-222. ^ Ayyal-i-Shafi and the Ayyal-i-Shawan. ^ 1 he former allied themselves with Nasir- bin-Mobarik, the notorious pirate, and the latter with the Sheikhs of Nairn and Zobarah. In consequence of the friendship existing between the Nairc tribe and the Sheikh of Bahrein it was feared that the alliance concluded between them and the Ayyal-i-Shawan might lead to Sheikh Esau taking their part, should they proceed to hostilities with the Beni Hajir. Colonel Ross was Political a., september 1876, Nos. 218-222. therefore desired^ to express to Sheikh ^ No. 2092 p., dated 14th September 1876. E sau expectation of the Governor- General in Council that he would keep aloof from all inter-tribal disputes or js;;. arrangements on the mainland. In the . r. . o autumn of 1877 it came to the knowlerW Political a., Decemberi877 ( Nos . 190-191. , tv/t ■ f &gt; o -i . luc ^^w^qge ot Her Majesty's Resident m the Persian Gulf that the Chief of Bahrein was again mixing himself up in the affairs of the mainland. In a letter addressed to him by Major Grant, the Officiating Resi dent, the following allegations were brought against him :— ' 1. That he had entered into intimate and friendly relations with the Nairn tribe liv ing in Zobarah, whom he had subsidized and permitted to frequent his Islands. '2. That the Chief had 100 men of that tribe regularly in his army at Bahrein as soldiers; that he allowed them to go to Zobarah, whenever the latter place was threatened [C943FD] M50 with an attack by Bedouins, and that not long ago he actually despatched a strong body of armed men to Zobarah whom he supplied with arms and provisions. '3. That the Chief, through the mediation of Nasir-bin-Jubar, Chief of the Nairn tribe, had entered into friendly relations with Nasir-bin-Khalii el Hajjiree who was prepar- ing to go to Bahrein with his followers.' 174. To the above the Chief of Bahrein replied as follows ' That the Naim tribe go to Bahrein on their own account, and that it was necessary at times to give them presents to prevent their doing mischief and joining his enemies, Nasir- bin-Mobarik and others. ' 2. That he was in the habit of keeping persons of the Naim tribe in Bahrein, while the people were away at the pearl banks and the town empty. ' 3. That the only people, who left Bahrein for Zobarah were those of the Naim tribe who habitually visit Bahrein for gifts, and who returned of their own accord upon hearing that a hostile force had come to attack Zobarah but that he furnished them with no arms. '4. That as regards Nasir-bin-Khalil el Hajjiree, that Chief asked permission to visit Bahrein with his people through Nasir-bin-Jubar, but he (the Bahrein Chief) refused per mission, neither would he accede to Nasir-bin-Jubbal's proposals to make peace ^with Nasir- bin-Khalil when the latter suggested it. Finally, that he always acted up to the advice fur nished him by Government, and always intended to do so in respect of interference with the tribes on the mainland, but that he was much Political A., December 1877, Nos. 190-193. harassed by the Bedouins from the mainland against his will.' 175. In reporting* the above the Political Resident drew attention to the _ _ _ n • • J „ 1 0 difficulties of the Sheikh's position with * No. 248, dated Busnire, 3rd November 1877. , , . • 1 j j regard to the tribes on the mainland and added :— ' were he to offend the Naim tribe by withholding presents or preventing their visiting Bahrein, the result would probably be that they would unite with the Beni Hajir in forming a hostile coalition against him.' 176. The Government of India concurred in the views of Colonel Ross, but thought further action in the matter unnecessary.5* CHAPTER XXI. (l) Aggressive policy of the Turks and establishment of a new Tur kish province on the littoral of the Persian Gulf. (2) Claims pre ferred on behalf of inhabitants of Katar against certain residents of Bahrein, 1875-76. 177. In 1875 the Turkish Government despatched Nasir Pasha, the Mon- tefik Chief, with a large force to quell the revolt of the Wahabi Prince, Abdul Rahman, against their rule. On the restoration of order, Nasir Pasha withdrew with the Turkish forces to Basrah, and shortly afterwards he was appointed Governor of a new Turkish province formed on the littoral, consisting of Basrah and its dependencies and the province of Nejd. The establishment of this province, and more especially the appointment of Nasir Pasha, caused grave apprehension amongst the Trucial Chiefs of the coast, who addressed the Politi cal Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject. 178, Two claims were preferred by Nasir Pasha on the part of Sheikh „ ^ ^ Mahomed bin Said and Sheikh Khamis Political a ., January 17, os. 1 70. ^ j uma j Kowareh, stated to be two respectable merchants of Katar, against certain persons said to have settled in Bahrein. The claims originated in connection with the pearl fisheries and according to the ordinary mode of procedure would have been referred for adjustment to a ' Salifah ' or court of pearl merchants. The importance of the case consisted in the fact that Colonel Ross suspected that the real object of Nasir Pasha in taking it up was a desire to interfere with the affairs of Bahrein, in the hope of committing the Turkish Government to his policy. On this account Colonel Ross suggested that in the event of further pressure being brought to bear on the Chief of Bahrein, it might be advisable to refer the matter to the arbitration of the British Government, at the same time he wrote to Sheikh Esau advising him to settle the matter in a friendly and courteous manner and recommending him not to permit his territories to be used as a place of refuge by dishonest persons. This advice was approved of by the Government of India, who wrote as follows to Colonel Political A., January 1876. No. Rosg ^ dated ^ J anuary 1876) 11 You are directed to confine yourself to offering friendly advice and to urging the Chief to effect in a fair and honest spirit a settlement of the claims in question. If, how ever, Nasir Pasha should not be satisfied with the proceedings of the Chief in this matter, and should attempt to enforce his demands by menaces or a display of force, you may justly, under the spirit of Article 3 of the Treaty with the Chief of Bahrein, dated May 1861, inter vene with a view of protecting the territory of Bahrein from maritime aggression.' The case was reported to the Home Government for the information of the Secretary of State, and the London Foreign Office instructed Her-Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople to call the attention of the Porte to the subject.53 CHAPTER XXII. Revolt in Hasa and piracies in Bahrein waters, 1878-81. 1 79. After a calm of nearly four years storms gathered round Bahrein again, originating from piracies on the Katif coast. 179A. In October 1878, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed to Colonel Nixon, stating that the Reported revolt m Ei-Hasa. neighbourhood of Katif was very unsafe and that frequent piracies were being committed, and asking whether the Turkish authorities would assent to our acting against pirates^ He also reported that the sons of Saud bin Feysal had revolted in the province of Hasa and captured Damaum. Abdullah bin Feysal was said to be supporting the movement and the Turkish authority over the province of Hasa was endangered. Colonel Ross added that urgent orders for the despatch of troops were necessary. 180. Abdullah Pasha, in reply to a telegram from Colonel Nixon, admitted that insecurity to a certain extent existed in the neighbourhood of Katif, but maintained that sufficient troops had already been despatched. The Turkish authorities also declined to accept Colonel Ross' proposal that the British Government should assist them in acting against pirates. The opera tions of H. M. S. Vulture, restored sea communications and rendered „ the waterway safe towards the end of Political A., January 1879, No. 300, October 181. Up to this time reports from Nejd showed that the rising against the „ * a t q .. Turks there had not proved formidable. Political A., January 1879, No 315. ^p, a 1 r ft *1 1 1 he Arabs ot Hasa were said to have assured the acting Governor of support in case of attack from outside, but they demanded relief from the misconduct and corruption of the local officials. The principal tribes in revolt were those concerned in the piracies complained of by Colonel Ross, viz.^ the Beni Hajir, the, Ajman, and the Amayer. 182. On the 7th November Colonel Nixon reported to Her Majesty's r . . T Q 0 M Ambassador at Constantinople that the Tolitical A., January 1878, No. 319. „ . . K , ^ country near Basrah was quieting down, as the Montefik had heard that Nasir Pasha, their Chief, had been re-appointed Governor-General of Basrah. 183. On the 15th Febuary 1879 Colonel Ross reported the occurrence of Political A., September 1879, No, 90. frequent robberies in the villages Bahrein attended with several murders. Several of the robbers were arrested and severely punished, but the ringleader Ali-bin-Jabir, although captured, managed to effect his escape. There were strong suspicions that his escape was arranged with the cognizance of the Chief, b it Sheikh Esau in a letter to Colonel Ross denied this. Ali-bin-Jabir was said to have joined the B'eni Hajir pirates. 184.,On the 5th March 1879 the Naval Commander-in-Chief was asked Political A., September 18^9, No. 98. station 3. \ essel at or near Bahrein so long as v the Resident considered the measure necessary. 185. In his despatch No. 7 of the 20th February 1879 the Secretary of Secret, September 1879, No. 10. State expressed approval of the measures . taken of the repression and punishment of acts of piracy in the waters of the Persian Gulf and adjoining Arab coast reported in Government of India despatch No. 6 of 17th January 1879. He observed:— ' The facts reported however appear to me to indicate the expediency of an early understanding with the Turkish Government in regard to Ottoman jurisdiction and respon- sibiiity for order along the Arabian shore of the Gulf ; and it is therefore important that I shouid receive, at as early a date as possible, the full expression of the views of Your Excellency m Council in the matter.' 1S6. Before replying to this despatch the Government of India, in their piracies from November 1878 to May 1879. despatch to Secretary of State, No. 55 ^ f . . . 1 * 1 . 1 22nd May 1879, gave a complete account of the piracies which had occurred subsequent to the issue of their previous53 despatch of 17th January 1879. The most important events that had occurred in the interval were as follows :— 187. At the latter end of December 1878 Mansoor-bin-Mlnakhir, a D 1 • r, . . _ &gt;T Sheikh of the Aiman tribe, joined with Political a ., September .879. No,, ms -s.. ^ Zaid.bi^Mahomed of the Beni Hajir, and having forcibly seized a boat belonging to a subject of Bahrein, put out to sea. They attacked two boats in the neighbourhood of Katif and carried off from one of them property valued at Rs. 20,000. Ten boats conveying Turkish soldiers from Ojair to Katif were in sight, but, on being appealed to, declined to inter fere. Colonel Ross brought to notice the impunity enjoyed by Zaid-bin- Mahomed and other pirates residing at Zahran in the vicinity of Katif through the apathy and indifference of the Turkish authorities, and expressed an opinion that the seizure of Zaid-bin-Mahomed or his expulsion from Zahran was a measure of primary necessity. The Government of India thereupon, after ascertaining from the Resident, Bushire, that Zahran was within recognized ^ Turkish jurisdiction, and that Zaid-bin- Pohtical A., September 1879, No. 156. u/r 1 j t 1 • 1 ^ . 1 • 1 Mahomed was a Turkish subject, desired the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to urge the Turkish authorities either to oper- „ „. . „ , „ XT ate promptly against Zaid-bin Mahomed or Political A., September 1879, No. 153. i r . .i' 7 f ■ ro-,- 1 to accept the alternative of British action. 188. Instead of carrying out these directions Colonel Nixon asked the „ . „ v „ „ Vali of Basrah whether a British ship of Political A., September 1879, No. 158. 1 11 . 1 1 v 1 1 war should be sent to check disorder, and referred the same questions to the British Ambassador at Constantinople. The Vali replied that a Turkish corvette had been ordered to cruise in the disturbed parts, and that the Mutassarif of Katif had received stringent instructions to suppress further piracies. 189. Ultimately the Turkish Minister of Marine directed the Broussa or the Iskendariah, or both, if necessary, to proceed to the Nejd coast, and declared , . 0 , • that the Basrah authorities would be held Political A , September 1879, No. 154. mi r .i . • 1 responsible tor the restoration and main tenance of order. 190. On the 22nd January Colonel Ross reported that a Turkish force had „ . XT ^ ^ marched by land against El-Hussein, a Political A., September 1879, Nos. 100-160. ... r *1 c n \ j 1 j village five miles from Zahran, and had destroyed it; but the ringleader and other persons concerned in recent piracies were not captured. The measures taken therefore were altogether inadequate ...... o xt . and piratical boats continued to molest Political A.. September 1879, No. 162. ,. 1 , l .1 .1 t 1 trading vessels ; moreover, both the iurk- ish vessels of war broke down. 191. On the 14th February 1879 the Resident, in the Persian Gulf tele- . „ L „ » T graphed that Zaid-bin-Mahomed's success Political A., September 1879, No. 171. i i i j ^ r l * * a \/ had led to further piracies off Katif. A fresh gang of the Beni Hajir had started under another leader and captured two Bahrein vessels laden with dates ; afterwards they joined Zaid's band near El-Hussein and departed with their booty into the interior. Subsequently they put to sea again in search of further prizes and closed communication between Bahrein and Katif. The Chief of Bahrein expressed alarm for his islands, and asked either that he might be permitted to take the necessary measures for the recovery of his boats, or that H. M. S. Spartan should act. In Colonel Ross' judgment the piracies were likely to attain formidable dimensions, and to prejudice British prestige and interests; the therefore suggested that the Turkish Government should arrange with the Ejman tribe to coerce the Beni Hajir, who might be cut off from the sea, and that all the landing places should be occupied and the coast patrolled, a vessel of war being stationed at Behrein for a time. 192. The Government of India directed Colonel Ross to order H. M. S. .... „ , „ Spartan to cruise in the neighbourhood of Political A., September 1879, No. 172. ./ , , 1-, f - * 1 Katif and to protect Bahrein as required by treaty. He was authorized to suppress piracy by sea and to punish maritime [ C 943 FD ] ' 054 offenders whatever their nationality, but operations on the mainland were nrohibited He was also empowered to place a British officer temporarily at P * Bahrein, and Captain Durand, the First Political a., September 1879, No. 178. Assistant to the Resident proceeded thither. 193. On the 15th February Colonel Ross telegraphed that on the Iith February thirty Beni Hajir from Zahran Political A, September 1879, No. 174. had committed a raid on Azaria, 10 miles from Manamah on the larger island of Bahrein, and killed one man. The Chief of Bahrein desired permission to seize the boats in possession of the pirates at Zahran, and begged either for complete protection or permission to attack his enemies by sea. Colonel Ross considered the Chief's fears to be well founded and recommended that our ships of war should be employed against the pirates. He was desired to report his plans after political a ., September 18,9, 0.175. consultation with the naval officers on the spot. 194. Colonel Ross then recommended the thorough examination of the „ „ part of the coast infested by robber gangs, Political a ., September 1 / 9 I 0.17. the recovery of Bahrein vessels in their possession. The pirates were to be prevented as for as possible from getting boats, and he asked that a British vessel of war should be stationed at t_ o xt or near Bahrein. The Government of Political a., September 1879, No 179. ... i.* j i.u I i.L India sanctioned these proposals on the understanding that Colonel Ross' plans had been laid in consultation with the naval officers, and that no expedition would be undertaken on the mainland beyond reach ot the guns of the British vessels. 195. The two vessels stolen from Bahrein were ultimately recovered by . —, . q 00 H. M. S. Vulture, and early in April the Political a., September 1879, Nos. 180.181. d .. . , . i... u j • ^ j Resident reported that matters had quieted down, and that Captain Durand and his escort might leave Bahrein. 196. The detailed correspondence upon all the events reported by tele- d it * 1 a c v ,0. .q-, g ra P h w as subsequently received. It Po.ilical a, September 1879. No. 183. u J 4.U ± 'r 1 • i. t-i „ 191. showed that the Turkish action at El •• ' ■» ' Hussein had been unsuccessful, that no property was recovered, and no pirates captured or punished. 197. The orders issued by the Government of India are contained in Political A., September 1879, No. 199 let , ter t0 Ross, No. ioio-P. of 25th March 1879, which called for a further report showing in detail the results of the action taken in accordance with the telegraphic instructions conveyed to Colonel Ross. 198. With regard to the report that a Nakhoda of Bahrein had been in collusion with the Beni Hajir in their attack on Azaria under Ali-bin-Jabir, the action taken by Colonel Ross in pressing the Chief of Bahrein to effect the man's seizure was approved, and Colonel Ross was directed to take an early opportunity of explaining to the Chief that he must show no laxity in dealing with his subjects and dependents who might be proved to be implicated in piracies, and that the obligations accepted by the British Government towards his territories in no way absolved him from taking necessary precautions to ensure, as far as lay within his power, the safety of his own territory, 199. In reply to subsequent communications giving details of the arrange- Political a , September 1879. No. 200. ments made at Bahrein, Colonel Ross was ' ' S09, informed that his proceedings were general ly approved, and he was requested to forward a tabular statement or memoran dum showing with reference to Article 3 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated 31st May 1861, the maritime aggressions of which the Chief complained and Political a ,, September 1879^ No. ai6. steps in each case to obtain repara tion.55 soo. Despatch No. 55, dated 22nd May 1879, described the continued piracies of the Beni Hajir under Zaid-bin-Mahomed joined by the Ajman along the coast between Katif and Ojair and the inadequate and ineffective measures of repression taken by the Turkish authorities. It noticed the apprehensions of the Chief of Bahrein, his application to the British authorities with special re ference to the daring'raid on Azaria and the obligations of the British Govern ment towards the Chief. 201. At the close of the despatch in which this description of recent piracies Proposals for suppression piracies. was transmitted to the Secretary of State Political a,, september 1879, No. 231. the Government of India called attention to a letter, dated 4th March 1879, which Cononel Nixon, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, had addressed to Sir A. Layard, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, on the subject of the piracies in the Persian Gulf, and observed:— ' Colonel Nixon is not understood to be personally acquained with the country which he describes, and the accuracy of the information which he has furnished to Her Majesty 's Ambassador at Constantinople is open to question. In dealing with the outrages our difficulty has been that they have been committed either within Turkish territorial waters or in close proximity thereto—a point which Colonel Nixon does not seem to have fully appreciated. That officer further considers that the recent piracies in the Gulf have arisen out of quarrels of the tribes on the mainland of Nejd and Bahrein. This view is not shared by Colonel Ross, tlie Resident in the Persian Gulf, who has an intimate knowledge of these localities, and who necessarily possesses far superior means of obtaining information regarding them. According to Colonel Ross no inter-tribal disputes were going on, and the outrages were committed, for the most part, by well known piratical gangs whose sole object was plunder* ' Moreover, on the 20th January and 26th February, Mr. Robertson, the Political Assistant and Vice-Consul at Pasrah, within Political A., September, No. 218. which Pashalik the Turkish possessions on the „ » »» &gt;♦ 228 - Arab coast are situate, informed Colonel Nixon that no disturbance whatever existed in the interior, but that if order was not restored on the coast, the disturbances might spread to the mainland. Nor is there any sufficient evidence, so far as can be ascertained, for the statements that the Turks have conquered years ago all the mainland in the interior from Koweit to Zobarah, and that the coast line of petty tribes has fallen insensibly under Turkish dominion, and that really all the interests of the Nejd coast rest in Turkey.' 202. Meanwhile Colonel Ross forwarded a copy of a letter from the Com mander of H. M. S. Vulture in which Political A, September 1879, Nos.376-282. g ave opinion of the measures which should be adopted to suppress piracy on the Turkish Arabian coast. His opinion, although arrived at independently, coincided exactly with that expressed by Colonel Ross In his telegram of 28th February 1879 He sugge^ed that British cruisers, acting on Colonel Ross' requisition, should be permitted to track the pirates, if necessary, to their bases of operation on the Ncjd coast, where their boats and vessels could generally be destroyed or cap tured without going beyond the beach : that the channels west and south of Bahrein should be surveyed, and to assist In these operations he recommended that a steam pinnace should be permanently stationed near Bahrein, with the view also of protecting the islands from the raids of the Bedouins. 203. In reply to Colonel Ross' letter we forwarded to him a letter from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, in which he stated his opinion that a steam pinnace was not required, and that the ships detailed for duty in the Persian Gulf were amply sufficient for all purposes. His Excellency recom mended that a vessel should be stationed at Bahrein permanently, until the marauding tribes had entirely disappeared, and that the British India Mail Steamers should call at Bahrein in going up and down the Gulf. 204. In our despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 77 of the 23rd June 1879, we forwarded a tabular statement Political A., September 1879, No. 338. compiled by Colonel Ross showing in detail the total reported losses from piracies on the f urkish Arabian coast and the cases in which, in his opinion, the British Government were interested in recovering Indemnity. Our despatch also forwarded papers connected with the recent course of events in the Persian Gulf.56 205. A translation of Colonel Ross' statement of piracies was given to Abdullah Pasha, the Governor of Basrah, who promised to make enquiries in the matter, and a copy was also sent to Colonel Nixon with a request that he would urge the Turkish authorities (through whatever channel he might deem most effectual) to recover the amount plundered as far as possible. The total losses were estimated at 67,008-25 krans, of which the British Government were considered to be interested in the recovery of 8,834-25 krans. The action taken by Colonel Nixon was to send a copy of the statement to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and another to Mr. Robertson at Basrah. 206. On the nth March 1S79 Colonel Ross visited Bahrein and stayed there colonel Ross' visit to Bahrein in Mareh till the i8th He had several interviews 1879 with Sheikh Esau, and his brother Sheikh Political a., September 1879, No. 303. Ahmed, and found them in a state of con siderable irritation, because of the restraint placed on them in the matter of re prisals towards the mainland, the gist of their complaint being that whilst they themselves were prevented from acting against the Beni Hajir and others, Colonel Ross had not succeeded in obtaining restitution of property stolen or compensation, nor had the Turkish Government taken steps to punish the pira tical Bedouins. 207. Colonel Ross invited Sheikh Esau to state any measures he was desirous of having carried out, and to offer suggestions in connection with the recent disturbances. Sheikh Esau's requests were— (1) That the Bahrein robber, AH-bin-Jabir, and his associates, of whose proceedings an account has been given in another part of this precis, and who had been arrested by the Turkish authorities and sent a prisoner to El-Hasa, should be handed over to him for punishment. In support of this request the Chief urged that when certain robbers concerned in the Kashmir piracy at Basrah had fled to Bahrein, he had caused them to be seized and surrendered to the Turkish authorities. Colonel Ross, in reply, promised that he would endeavour to obtain the extradition of the criminals on the understanding that the Chief would be res ponsible that they did not again escape. (2) That as the port of Zakunniyah, near Ojair, was a resort of pirates, either steps should be taken to prevent its being inhabited, or he should be allowed to send some of his own people to reside there. To this Colonel Ross replied that the place was in Turkish territory, and that the interference of Bahrein was impossible, but that his statement should be made known to the Turkish authorities. (3) That Colonel Ross would obtain restitution of 311 sheep which had been stolen from Bahrein and landed in Turkish territory. Colonel Ross promised to use his best endeavours in the matter. Besides these specified requests Sheikh Esau intimated his hope and ex pectation that with the aid of the British Government the value of all property plundered from his subjects in Turkish waters would be restored, and that protection would be continued to the islands. He further expressed a wish to take measures to coerce the El-Dowasiri tribe, his own subjects residing in Bahrein, whom he suspected of treason and collusion with the Beni Hajir. On this point Colonel Ross refused to advise and only expressed a hope that the Chief would be careful rot to act so as to cause disturbances on the island. In the letter which contained an account ot his visit to Bahrein, Colonel Ross aslo reported the operations of H. M. S. Vulture in the recovery of another Bahrein vessel which was lying ashore on the beach near Katif. 208. Colonel Ross' proceedings in these matters were approved in our Political A, September 1879, No. 335. letter N0, of 2nd June 1879.57 209. In pursuance of his promise to the Chief, Colonel Ross wrote to „ M n Colonel Nixon on the ^ist March send- Political a., September 1879, No. 308. • i- . r r 1 r • ing him an account 01 a tresh case of piracy in which about 30 Bedouins under Mahomed-bin-Fowaz, Dowasiri, had attacked a boat belonging to Ali-bin-Hassan, a subject of Bahrein. He added that until some signal punishment was inflicted on the offending Bedouins by the Turkish authorities, it was idle to expect the former to desist from these mal practices, and he gave the names of the best known leaders of piratical bands— (1) Zaid-bin-Mahomed (Hajiri). (2) Mozi-bin-l'ozah (Hajiri). (3) Mahomed-bin-Fowaz (El-Dowasiri). He then urged Colonel Nixon to move the Turkish authorities to grant Sheikh Esau's requests for the extradition of Ali-bin-Jabir and his associates, and for the restoration of the stolen sheep, and to take steps for the proper control of Zakunniyah. 210. Colonel Ross also wrote to Mr. Robertson, the Political Agent at Bas- Surrender of Ali bin-jabir. rah, on the subject, and heard from him that Political a ., September 1879, No. 334- His Excellency Abdullah Pasha of Basrah would authorize the Mutasarrif of Nejd to deliver up Ali-bin-Jabir and his followers to the Sheikh of Bahrein on his sending an agent to claim and receive them. On this Colonel Ross directed Sheikh Esau to send trustworthy per- _ sons with a letter to the Mutasarrif formally Political a ., eptemher i 75, 0. 332. requesting extradition of the culprits, and stating clearly what crimes they had committed in Bahrein. Sheikh Esau acted accordingly, but was told by the Mutasarrif, on the 15th April, that he was await ing instructions from Abdullah Pasha. 211. Meanwhile Colonel Ross had been told apparently verbally that the . „ , Mutasarrif declined to give up Ali-bin- Political A., September iByQ, No. 3^5* Tt.* i it Jabir unless bheikh lisau gave up one Ali-bin-Hassan, presumably a Turkish subject, accused of having defrauded the Turkish Government whilst employed as an accountant in the service of that Government at El-Katif. Colonel Ross immediately addressed Colonel Nixon asking him to move Abdullah Pasha to maintain his orders for the extradition of Ali-bin-Jabir and his associates irrespective of the case of Ali-bin- Hassan which was of a very different character. He also sent a copy of this letter to Mr, Robertson, who obtained an acknowledgment from the Pasha that the cases of Ali-bin-Hassan and Ali-bin-Jabir were quite distinct and should be treated separately. The Pasha further said that his order for the surrender of the robber could not have reached the Mutasarrif when he declined to give the gang up. 212. On the receipt of this information Colonel Ross instructed Sheikh Esau to again apply to the Mutasarrif for the surrender of the prisoners. 213. On the 16th May Colonel Ross forwarded translation of a report from the Operations oitbe Governor of Et-Hasa Bgaiast News Agent at Bahrein, describing the jabaii. operations of the Mutasarnr or Lrovernor Political a., September 1879, No. 336.

The Mutasarrif proceeded to Jabaii in the Iskanderiah with some troops and plundered the castle of Sobaih, the inhabitants of which place fled on his approach. 214. On the 30th May 1879 the Turkish blockade runner Arkadi arrived Arrival of the Ark&amp;di at Basrah. at Basrah from Constantinople with two Political a ., September 1879, No. 5®a. life boat cutters, each fitted to carry a small gun. 4 215. In our despatch No. 91 of 28th July 1879 we forwarded to Secretary of State copy of two letters from Colonel Political a ., September 1879, No. 350. Ross. The first of these contained a state- (l) (i) 0 No. 6 i 7 7 0 i 0f8th a V 879 ..' ment drawn U P b y Colonel Ross, show ing the maritime aggressions brought to [C943FD] p58 the notice of the Resident by the Chief of Bahrein, as having been committed on vessels belonging, and persons subject, to his authority. 216. The Government of India observed that the British Resident was bound by Article 3 of the Bahrein Convention of 1861, forthwith to take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation, and that accordingly application had been made through the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to the Turkish authorities at Constantinople. The recovery of four stolen boats by H. M. S. Vulture was also reported. 217. The second letter was a reply to a reference from the Government of India, and contained Colonel Ross' reasons for his non-concurrence with the opinion expressed by Colonel Nixon that the recent piracies in the Gulf had emanated from internecine quarrels among the tribes upon the mainland. Colonel Ross attributed these lawless outbreaks to the neglect of the Turkish local authorities to deal vigorously with the offenders at the beginning. 218. On the 15th July 1879 the Resident in the Persian Gulf reported by tele- Zaid-fain-Mabotned. . gram that Zaid-bin-Mahomed, the notorious Political A.^September 1879 No. 503. Beni Hajir robber, was again engaged in piracy. He had plundered a Bahrein pearl vessel and killed or wounded four persons. The Resident remarked that this was to be expected from the com plate immunity enjoyed by the pirates. 219. Colonel Ross was asked by telegram to report the locality of the piracy Political a., September 187 , No. 515. whether it took place in I urkish waters , j « t&gt; ' * 1 or 0 P en sea, and whether he deemed it necessary to order the British gun-boats to aid on the spot. 220.

Also that two corvettes were being despatched to the Gulf. 226. Colonel Ross intended to request the Senior Naval Officer, who was at Bahrein, to investigate the guilt of the people of Khor Shujeej, on whom he thought Government should induce the Turks to inflict punishment should their guilt be established. 227. In reporting the matter to Secretary of State, the Government of India Political A., September 1879, No. 520, observed in their despatch No. 102 of the 1st September 1879— 'While it is very desirable on general grounds that an understanding should be speedily arrived at on the question dealt with in our despatch No. 127, dated 22nd Mav. it is necessary that in the meantime, pressure should be brought to bear on the local Turkish authorities whereby they may be induced either to adopt adequate measures of their own for the capture and punishment of Zaid-bin-Mahomed, or to acquiesce in the needful action being taken by the Resident in Persian Gulf. Your Lordship will perceive from the in- closures of this despatch that as long as Abdulla Pasha, whose shortcomings have been al- teTy postponed^' n0tlCe, remains at Basra h, the requisite measures are likely to be indefini- 228. i he Resident s action in respect to Zaid-bin-Mahomed and the Beni Hajir was approved, but the Government of India disapproved of Colonel Ross' proposal that the Turkish Government should be called upon to inflict punish ment on the Khor Shujeej, inasmuch as they were unable to admit that Khor Shujeej and Ras Lafan were situated within acknowledged Turkish juris- 229. In October 1879 the Government of India reported to Her Majesty's Removal of Abdullah Pasha, who is succeeded Secretary of State that Abdullah Pasha had 1,y poMtfA.! h N;.e,„ber I 8 7 9,No.,38. completely failed to give any satisfaction tor th e piracies committed upon British vessels within Turkish waters, or any information with regard to the enquiries alleged to have been instituted by the Turkish authorities, and they noted with satisfaction that he had been removed from his post, and succeeded by Zabit Pasha as Governor-General of Basrah. 230.

Where pressure put on the Sheikhs of the Beni Hajir, they would, no doubt, readily capture and deliver him to the authorities. 337. In November 1879 Colonel Ross forwarded reports from the News- .. *,i_ w Agent at Bahrein regarding the removal of Removal of a section of the Albu-Kowarah irom 0 .

They were said to be offended by some pro ceedings of the local Turkish authorities; the Turkish Governor-General of Hassa having sent an order that no one was to be allowed to settle between Obeyja and Odeid, or anywhere on the coast of Kalar, except at Bidaa. Should anyone so settle, a ship would be sent to destroy their settlement. 236. In the December following, Captain Woodruff, Senior Naval Officer Captain Woodruffe's cruise in the Gulf. ^ the Gulf, Was deputed tO visit Various Political A, February 1880, No. 81. places on the coast, and lo deliver to the Sheikhs of Khor Shujeej and Katar letters from Colonel Ross, warning them to be careful of becoming implicated in the piracies of the Beni Hajir. He obtained assurances from the Sheikhs that ihey would act in accordance with the wishes of the British Government. At the same time Captain Woodruffe made enquiries as to the cause of the removal of the Albu-Kowarah tribe from Bidaa to Foweyrat. Jasim-bin-Mahomed Thani of El-Bidaa accused the Sheikh of Bahrein of having instigated the tribe to leave Bidaa, and from the reports of the Native Agent at Bahrein it appeared that some of the elders of the tribe had gone to Bahrein, and had there received presents. 237. Colonel Ross was of opinion that the removal of Sheikh Mahomed bin Saeed, the chief of the tribe, arose from jealousy of Jassim-bin-Mahomed Thani who, as the nominee of the Turks, had obtained ascendancy at El-Bidaa, and he remarked that the secession had caused much irritation to Jassim and satisfaction to the Bahrein Sheikh. Colonel Ross also reported that he had written to Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali, who was in charge of Bahrein during the absence of his brother, and warned him against interfering on the mainland. The Sheikh denied any interference, and promised to abide by the Resident's advice, and not to visit the mainland during his brother's absence. Zabit Pasha again addressed. ^3^* April 1 880 Zablt Pasha Was Political A., May 1880 Nos. 163-167. again addressed regarding Zaid-bin-Maho- med, and replied that he had not been successful in effecting his capture. „ t . . . u mi. a a 239.

Colonel Ross, therefore considered the presence of one of Her Majesty's vessels at Bahrein desirable as a matter Turkish authorities addressed. of P^caution The Turkish authorities were addressed and sent strong and positive orders to the Mutasarriff of Nejd to enquire into the fresh cases of piracy. Political A, August .880, No. 34. The Government of India requested the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, to report the result of these orders. 240. On the 9th December the Resident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed that Nasir-bin-Mobarik's attempt to attack Bahrein. a body of Arabs under Nasir-bin-Mobarik Secret, January 1881, No. 47. ^ had asS e m bled On the mainland Opposite Bahrein, and were watching for an opportunity to attack the island. Prepara tions were made for sending a vessel of war to the spot, but the raid failed owing to the want of boats. 241. The orders issued by the Vali of Baghdad to the Mutassariff of Nejd, Political a . January 1881, Nos. 70-7 regarding the suppression of piracies had no effect whatever, and from subsequent corresponaence with the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, and with the Resident6i in the Gulf, it appeared that the Turkish vessel Arkadi had not been engaged on any duty connected with the arrest of Zaid-bin-Mahomed and other pirates, as alleged by the Turkish authorities. 242.

The Arabs with him were said to belong to the Munasir, Beni Hajir, and Al-Murrah tribes, and were about 600 in number. They assembled near Ruais and Abdu'l Dhuloof, whence they intended to cross over to Bahrein, but were prevented by the inhabitants who refused to lend them their boats. 2 43* January 1881 Colonel Ross forwarded copies of letters received from Secret, Tune 1881. No. 10. Nasir-bin-Mobarik and Sheikh Jassim-bin- Mahomed Thani, Chief of El-Bidaa, written after the failure of the attack on Bahrein, Nasir bin Mobarik asked for the support and assistance of the British Government, and promised to act in accordance with their wishes. He also announced his intention of crossing over to Bahrein, as his family, friends, and property were there. Colonel Ross, in reply, informed him that any hostile descent on Bahrein by him or any other person would be opposed and punished. 2 43*A. Jassim-bin-Thani asked Colonel Ross to act as mediator to make up the quarrel between Nasir bin Mobarik and Sheikh Esau, to which Colonel Ross replied that Nasir's right to property in Bahrein was not recognized, and that any allowance given him by the Bahrein Government would be, on condition of his abandoning his evil designs and selecting an approved residence, other than El-Katr. From Nasir bin Mobarik's letter is seemed probable that he would before long renew his attack on Bahrein. ^43'^. March 1881 the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia forwarded a copy of a letter from the Wali of Baghdad, in which he reported that he had ascertained from the Mutasarriff of Nejd that no piracy or plunder of vessels had been committed by Zaid-bin-Mahomed, and that prefect tranquillity and security prevailed on the Katr coast by sea and land. 243-C. From Colonel Ross' letters Nos. 25, 29 and 38 of the 19th and 26th Secret ]a„. ,88.. No fc .5.^. February and 11 th March it appeared that since the failure of his raid Nasir-bin-Mo barik had been living in Turkish territory at Katar, and Colonel Ross had held Jassim-bin-Mahomed, the Governor of Bidaa, responsible for his conduct. Jassim, however, in the Resident's opinion, had been all the time secretly assist ing Nasir, in his projects for recovering his possessions in Bahrein, and had recently attempted to get rid of his responsibility on the ground that Nasir had left his jurisdiction, and was supported by Bedouin Arabs. The Resident, how ever, informed Jassim that he must still hold him responsible for the conduct of Nasir-bin-Mobarik so long as he was on the Katr coast. Colonel Ross also thought it advisable that the Turkish Governor and authorities should be informed of Nasir's designs with a view to having his proceedings watched, and he recommended that Jassim should be warned that any hostile movement on the part of Nasir would be attributed to him. With this view he forwarded copies of the papers to the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, for any action he might think fit. 243-D. In subsequent letters of the 2nd and 9th April 1881, Colonel Ross Secret, J«.. .83,. No...; ,„d 3 .. reported that Nasir-bin-Mobarik received an allowance of oo dollars monthly from the Turkish Government, and that he himself asserted that he was encouraged in designs against Bahrein by promises of support in the event of his succeeding in gaining a footing on the island. Nasir, who had on previous occasions been invited to visit Colonel Ross at Bushire, had replied that he feared his doing so would give umbrage to the Turkish authorities, and that his allowance would be stopped. He proposed, however, to send to Bushire his cousin, Ali-bin-Nasir who had lately been released from Aden, and Colonel Ross saw no objection to [C943FD] p62 this. Colonel Ross also forwarded a letter from Jassim, who persisted in deny- ing that he was in any way responsible for Nasir s conduct. 243-F. On the receipt of Colonel Ross' letters on this subject, the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, made enquiries from Secret, June 1881, No. 34. the Wali of Baghdad regarding Nasir -bin- Mobarik's movements on the Katr coast. The Wali replied that, after enquiry from the Turkish authorities on that coast, he found that nothing had been done by Nasir-bin-Mobarik to justify any alarm on the part of the people or Sheikh of Bahrein. The Political Agent considered that this statement, which was so inconsistent with the state of affairs reported by Colonel Ross, was due to anxiety on the part of the Turkish officers to minimize the danger, lest they should be called upon to take effective measures to guard against it. Pend ing instructions from the Government of India he did not think it advisable to make any further representation to the Turkish authorities, as had been suggested by Colonel Ross, as no practical results were likely to follow from any such communication. If Jassim and Nasir-bin-Mobarik disregarded the warning con veyed to them by Colonel Ross, he advised that they should be dealt with under the orders of the Resident in the Persian Gulf in such manner as the circum stances of the case might seem to require. The effect of such procedure, he considered, would not only be decisive as regards the two individuals named, but would greatly simplify our future course of action in the Gulf, and although the proceedings of the Resident would probably elicit from the Turkish Govern ment a demand for explanation, it would not be very difficult to prepare an ade quate answer, to any reclamations which might be put forward, 244. The orders of the Government of India on the subject were conveyed Secret, Ju-e, .88., No,. 36 .37. their telegrams of the 7th May 1881 to the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia. The former was authorized to warn Jasim-bin- Mahomed that if he was in any way accessory to an attack on Bahrein, he would be held directly responsible. If the attack were made, the Resident was directed to report to the Government of India, and meanwhile he was requested to ascertain and report whether there was any Turkish force or sign of Turkish authority Secret, June 1881, No. 39. atBidaa. Colonel Ross replied that there was a Turkish guard, about 130 strong, at El-Bidaa, and that the Turkish flag was hoisted on the fort in which the guard was. 245. The instructions sent to the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, were that he should intimate formally to the Turkish authorities that, unless they could undertake to^ prevent and punish any attack oi) Bahrein from that part of the coast over which they claimed jurisdiction, the Government of India wouid be compelled^ in the event of measures becoming necessary to protect Bahrein or to redress injuries, to take the matter into their own har;ds.

Reference has just been made to the question of Turkish jurisdic- „ „ , „ „ VT lion on the Katif and Katar coasts for the Secret E., December 1878, Noa. a — H. f ... , purpose or suppressing piracies recently committed in Bahrein waters. The question was raised in the Secretary of State's despatch No. 42, dated 17th October 1878, and the opinion of the Gov ernment of India invited on the point. This involved the question of the de marcation of the Turkish sphere of territorial jurisdiction on that coast and the nature of the responsibility for order which should be held to devolve cn the two Governments. On these points the Government of India recommended that from Bassrah to Ojair the authority of the Porte should fie recognised as established on Land, hut at sea the British Government should continue to exer cise some concurrent protectorate pursuing pirates if necessary into Turkish •waters and dealing with them wherever found, whether at sea or on shore, within certain limits through 'the Resident in the Gulf; that south or east of Ojair, Turkish authority should not be recognized except at Bidaa on the Katar Penin sula ; and that the Porte should be required (a) to stipulate not to interfere, either on the coast or in the islands with the Trucial chiefs between Odeid and Ras-ul-Khima, (^) to recognize the territoriers of the Sheikh of Pa' rein as under the protection of Great Britain; and (c) in case of piracies from within its jurisdiction, to enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of com pensation. 248. There passed upon this despatch correspondence between the India i88o and Foreign Offices which was forwarded Pol. a ., May 1880, No. 18 Sir Muiiet'i letter, to the Government of India with Secretary dated 27th Septemoer 1880. 0 j: despatch No, 40, dated 6th Nov ember 1880. The view to which the Secretary of State for India (Lord Cran- brook) was inclined was :— 'The limit of Ottoman jurisdiction along the coast, if it is to be defined at all, could scarcely be fixed at any point north of Ojair, which is opposite the southern extremity of the island of Bahrein : but it is precisely between that spot and Katif theft since the settle ment of the Beni Yas at Odeid was broken up in 1878, the operations of the piratical tribes have been carried on with almost complete impunity. Upon this point Lord Cran- brook would invite Lord Salisbury's attention to Colonel Ross' letter of the 8th May, enclosed in Government of India despatch No. 91 of the 28th July last, which was communicated to the Foreign Office on the 6th instant. His Lordship apprehends that the effect of formally recognizing any particular part of the Arab coast and the waters adjacent as Turkish and as, in consequence, closed against British cruisers, so far as action against piratical craft is concerned, would 3e ike forma tion of an asyUm which would be taken advantaoe of by marauders in general, whom the local Ottoman authorities would be unable to control without a considerable and permanent increase to the Turkish naval Jorce in the Gulf i which the Porte has declared itself precluded from making by considerations of expense, and which would be open to many objections on political grounds. u The conclusion, therefore, to which Lord Cranbrook is ]ed \s that negotiation or discussion with the Pcrte on the territorial question should be avoided; but that, in order that the obligations contracted by the Government of India towards the Sheikh of Bahrein and the parties to the maritmie truce may be efficiently fulfilled the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorized to adopt all necessary measures for the preservation of the peace of the seas, without regard either to Turkish pretensions to sovereignty over the whole Arab coast, or to the recognition of Ottoman supremacy by individual Chiefs, such as the Sheikh of Bidar, or to the presence of Turkish officials at isolated points.' 249. In continuation of his despatch No. 40, dated 6th November 1879 re ferred to above the Secretary of State in Pol. A. May 1880, No. 37, his despatch No 4 (Secret) of 29th Janu ary 1880 forwarded further correspondence on the subject between the India and Foreign Offices. In a confidential communication regarding these papers, His Majesty 's Ambassador (Sir H. Layard) was instructed by .the Foreign Office, London, that wherever Turkish authority was at that time actually and firmly established upon the coast, His Majesty's Government 'would be ready to recognize64 it and would he glad to see it accompanied by a regular and civilised ad minis* tration. He was also directed to press upon the Forte the advisability of allow ing British ships—while pursuing their operations against piratical vessels outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north of Odeid—to pursue and capture them within the three-mile limit of that part of the coast. Further as regards Maskat, Bahrein, and the possessions of the Trucial Chiefs on the coast between Odeid and Ras-el-Khyma inclusive t Her Majesty's Government, while they considered it unnecessary to seek for any formal declaration from the Porte, renouncing all claims of sovereignty over those two territories, were in no way disposed to recede from their repeated denial of these claims, and considered themselves hound by their treaty engagements with their several Chiefs to resist any attempt&gt; whether direct or indirect, to give them practical effect. 249-A. In July 1880 Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople (Mr. Goschen) issued a note to the Governor-General at Baghdad drawing his atten tion to the increase of piratical expeditions in the Persian Gulf issuing from that side of the Arabian littoral, where the Turkish Government claimed to have estab lished jurisdiction, and asking his co-operation in a plan of operations for the suppression of the piracies north of Odeid. Mr. Goschen's proceedings were approved, but he was warned not to entangle himself in any discussion with the Porte about the territorial question. 249-B.

(I) Threatened attack on Bahrein by Nasir-bin-Mobarik and Sheikh Jasim of Bidaa, and (2) the policy to be maintained in relation to Sheikh Jasim and the Turkish Government, 1881, 250, In March 1881 the island of Bahrein was threatened with attack by the notorious refugee Nasir-bin-Mobarik, acting with the connivance of Jasim-bin- Mahomed and as there seemed reason to suspect, encouraged by the Turkish authorities in Arabia. Under these circumstances the Government of India caused Sheikh Jasim to be warned that if he was in any manner accessory to an attack upon Bahrein, he would be held directly responsible notwithstanding that he flew the Turkish flag and received a Turkish garrison; while the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia was instructed formally to intimate to the Ottoman authorities that unless they could undertake to prevent and punish piracies on the island from that part of the coast over which jurisdiction was claimed by the Porte, the Indian Government might be compelled in certain eventualities to 224^58 N 0 ' 237 of Secret ' Docember I88, ' Nos ' ta ^- e t ^ e matter ^ nt0 their own hands. !! 4 ' 25 ' /o o r ^ ' rhls ac ^ on wa s approved by Her Majesty's Government (See Secretary of State's Despatch No. 3., dated 26th August ro( 2 5 0 ;A; The Government of India in acknowledging the receipt of the Sec etary of State s Despatch No. 31, dated :6th August 1881, referred to above, la'ii'm 5 ! t l 1 1 ' St n UCtl0 ?

Your Lordship expresses approval of the orders issued by the Government of India in this matter, and, as some months have passed since the ^sue of t h 0S e orders without anv ur her threat of an attack upon Bahrein, it may be inferred that their effect has been bene- T l A ltl / f V \ ry ' nli u kely Nasir-bin-Mubarik will abandorhis desifns unon ^he island, and fresh disturbances on his part must be apprehended from time to* time • but if h is pnpcipal supporter, th. Sheikh of Bidaa, can be deterred from affording him h elp and * yide paragraph 79 ante.65 encouragement, much of his power for mischief will have been taken away. In our opinion there is reason to hope that the Sheikh will not disregard the warning conveyed to him by Colonel Ross, and that so far as Bahrein is concerned, his proceedings may for the future be less open to suspicion. 3. We have now, however, to forward for Your Lordship's orders some further papers regarding the position and proceedings of this Chief, and to ask for Your Lordship's Jn- structions with respect to the general question of his future relations with the British Government. Your Lordship is aware that the Sheikh has before now entertained the hope of gaining a footing to the eastward, at Odeid, and that he has been forbidden from establishing a settlement at this spot on the ground that Odeid belonged to the Chief of Abuthabi. It now appears that he has again shown a desire to send an expedition into the waters of the trucial Chiefs, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf has informed him that such a movement could not be permitted. We have approved of the Resident's action in this matter. But Colonel Ross further reports, in a letter* of the 16th August, which forms an enclosure to this despatch, that Jasim bin Muhammad has announced his intention of sending a force by sea to attack his enemies, the Ajman Bedouins, in the neighbourhood of Katif; and it is with special reference to this matter that we now address Your Lordship. 4. Your Lordship is aware that the Sheikh is nominally under Turkish jurisdiction, a fact which greatly complicates our dealings with him in all cases ; and in the present in stance his proposal is of such a nature that there is some reason to doubt whether the British Government would be justified in actively interfering against him. The Katif coast is in such close proximity to Bahrein that any expedition to this neighbourhood may easily have the effect of disturbing the security of the island while it would also in all probability lead to the renewal of piracies and disorder in the adjoining waters, On the other hand, there is no definite ground for regarding the expedition as directed against our feudatory, so that we ha\ e some hesitation in treating it as a matter to which Your Lordship's orders of the 26th August would apply ; and further, until piracies actually result from the despatch of the force, it appears to us that our cruisers cannot act against the Sheikh's boats under the instructions conveyed in Your Lordship's despatchf No. 28 of the 5th August, by which we were informed that Her Majesty's vessels need not be'too much hampered by the three mile limit in pursuing pirate craft into Turkish waters. Under these circumstances Colonel Ross has not thought it proper to interefere authorita tively in order to prevent the expedition, and we have expressed concurrence in, and ap proval of, his views. 5. Your Lordship will observe a reference in the 3rd paragraph of Colonel Ross's letter of the 16th August to an engagement made in 1868 by the father of the present Sheikh not to make war by sea. As this agreement had something of a personal charac ter, and as its force may be held to have been weakened, if not annulled, by the Turkish assumption of authority over Bidaa, we have thought it better for the present not to lay any stress on it. In reply, however, to Colonel Ross's letter, the Sheikh has just written to say that he proposes to abide generally by Colonel Ross's instructions, and not to com mence any warlike undertaking without his permission. Notwithstanding, therefore, his connection with the Turkish Government, the Sheikh maybe willing to admit as binding on him the engagement made by his father ; and, if so, the result may be to contribute materially to the security of Bahrein and the neighbouring seas. We shall instruct the Resident to bear the point in mind, and to take any suitable opportunity that may occur of ascertaining whether the engagement may still be treated as in force. P .O. No. m, Secret, Ma, .sfc, Nos. '• The Secretary of State replied in Despatch No. 3, dated 20th January 1882 3, The Chief in question occupies a part of the coast where the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Sultan has not been formally recognized by Her Majesty's Government, and is, in fact, little more than nominal; but he appears to fly the Turkish flag on shore, and to have admitted a Turkish garrison into his fort. On the other hand, he is in constant communication with the British Resident in the Gulf; he has lately abandoned a contem plated maritime expedition to the neighbourhood of the Turkish port of Katif, in defer ence to the remonstrances of that officer, to whose orders in such matters he professes his intention to submit ; and he has explicitly stated that he regards the seas of those parts as being ' under the British Government. 0 3. It seems, therefore, that to whatever extent the Chief may have accepted the posi tion of an Ottoman dependant, he, like his father before him, maintains very close and direct relations with the authorities of the Indian Government, and is prepared to defer to them in all matters affecting the peace of the seas. In the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, this disposition on the part of the Sheikh should be encouraged. There is nothing in it incompatible with corresponding relations on his part with the Turks as * Vide paragraph 8a ante. t paragraph 77 anft, [C943FDJ66 regards his affairs on land, while, if he act up to his professions, and abstain from ill-treat ment of British subjects, the precise nature of those relations may be a matter of compara tive indifference to the Indian Government, whose consistent policy has been to restrict its interference with the tribes on the Arab coast, whether parties to the maritime truce or not, to the measures necessary to prevent hostilities at sea, and to hold aloof from their quarrels and concerns on the mainland. To this policy Her Majesty's Government desire to adhere, 4. As regards the course which should be followed in the event of the Sheikh of Bidaa, or any other Chief similarly situated, putting to sea with hostile intentions, without refer ence to, or in disregard of, the warnings of the British Resident, it is not possible for me to give Your Excellency in Council precise instructions. It must depend upon the cir cumstances of each particular case, and upon the extent to which the peace of the seas may be menaced. From the correspondence which has passed within the last two years on the subject of Turkish pretensions to jurisdiction along the Arab coast, it will have been seen that, while Her Majesty's Government ave not disposed to object to extension of the Sultan's authority over the tribes of the Guttur peninsula, provided such autho rity be effectively exercised, it is their fixed determination neither to allow the Turkish local officials to use the cpizsVindependent tribes as instruments of aggression on Bahrein and the territories of the Trucial Chiefs, nor to permit the tribes to carry on piratical expeditions with impunity under the shelter of the Turkish flag. 7 he question, therefore, whether coercoin should be employed upon any particular occasion is one which must he decided hy Your Excellency's Government upon general considerations of expediency&gt; with special reference to your interest m the maintenance of peace at sea. as well as your obligations to the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs. 5. From the foregoing observations, Your Excellency in Council will perceive that the instructions lately issued to the Commanders of Her Majesty's ships in the Persian Gulf were not intended to bear the very restricted construction which has been placed upon them by your Government and by the Resident in the Gulf. As Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed • Led Gran* 1 lie to Lord Dufferin, No. 515, Jntimate to the Porte* in July last, the refusal dated aandJuly 1881, of ^ Turkish Government to entertain the proposals made to it for a sort of joint police of the seas along the Arab coast compelled Her Majesty's Government to undertake that duty single-handed ' without reference to the claims of the Sultan to territorial jurisdiction in those waters.' The instructions in question were accordingly issued, the intention being that the Commanders of British cruisers in the Gulf should have liberty to act as might be necessary to prevent or punish disturbance of the peace of the seas, avoiding, however, the raising of needless questions with the Turkish local authorities where they exist, or unnecessary encroachment upon the jurisdiction of the Sultan, wherever it may really be effectively established along the coast north of Odeid. \67 CHAPTER XXIV. (i) Intention of the Turks to establish a coal depot at Bahrein, (2) agreement signed by Chief of Bahrein not to have dealings with foreign powers, or allow establishment of their agencies or coal depots, 1880. 252. The year 1880, is marked by an important event in the political history of Bahrein. In December 1880, Sheikh Esau signed an agreement, by which he bound himself, to not to have any dealings with foreign powers without the consent of the British Government, and not to allow the establishment of their agencies or coal depots in his territory. We shall trace the genesis of this very important treaty. 353. There was at this time remarkable activity on the part of the Turks ... A „ q &lt; in the Persian Gulf. There were in Tune Political A, September 1879, N oj. 351-356. Q . n j • . r loyg rumours of an alleged intention of theirs to establish a coal depot at Bahrein. In November 1880 Turkish „ , A A M « Q M ofin 0,0 vessels were at Bahrein and the Captain Political A, April 1880, Nos. 269-270. £ , , ^ t-&gt; , • r 1 ' 11 of one of them gave out that Bahrein was Turkish territory. Other foreign powers also were extending their commercial activities in the Persian Gulf, and Bahrein would be the objective of almost all of them as an important trading centre. To secure therefore the island from the political cupidity of some of the more ambitious of them and to maintain the British political influence there was very desirable.* Colonel Ross therefore took upon himself to negotiate and conclude an agreement with the Chief of Bahrein with a view to this objecr, though he had not been previously authorized to proceed on this business. We shall read his |own report on his proceedings n i* • , a k oq m ten (No. 252, dated 24th December 1880) :— Political A, March 1881, Nos. 15-20. \ u j t / ' There has, as you are aware, been recently some'reason to suppose that the authorities of the Turkish Government desired to obtain a certain influence in Bahrein by establishing an agency, which should at first and ostensibly be under the form of a coal depot. It has been the settled policy of the Government of India in maintenance of the political rela tions subsisting with Bahrein to exclude the interference of other foreign Powers in the affairs of these islands, and the Chief of Bahrein has been desired to avoid direct communi cation on political matters with the Turkish Government, and to decline to give permission for the establishment at Bahrein of a coal depot by that Power. 2. It is further the ease that the attention of other Powers has been to some extent directed to the trade, &amp;c., of the Persian Gulf. French, American, and Japanese vessels have been sent into these waters on special missions by the respective Governments, and other Powers have representatives in the neighbourhood. 3. It is somewhat embarrassing for a ruler, situated like the Chief of Bahrein, to decline to allow the establishment of agencies or coal depots without being able to point to some formal engagement preventing. 4. It has appeared to me, therefore, that to formalize the actually existing under standing with the Chief of Bahrein by obtaining a distinct agreement from him would not only be a proper precaution for the adoption of which the time has come, but would also be convenient and advantageous to the Chief himself by furnishing him with a reason for declining the overtures of other foreign Powers which would be unanswerable and need give no offence. During a visit I have just paid to Bahrein I conversed with Sheikh Esau on this subject, and found that he took this view and was quite willing to accede to my suggestion. I accordingly took his signature to the agreement, which I now enclose in original, Arabic and English translation in duplicate. 5. You will see that I have made the conclusion of this agreement subject to the pleasure of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council, and I have not left any copy of it with the Chief of Bahrein, or any writing on the subject, so that if any objection should exist to its acceptance, it will be sufficient to signify the same to me. If the Government approve of it, I respectfully request that one copy of the Arabic document may be returned to me with the ratification endorsed on it for transmission to the Chief of Bahrein ♦ yide Appendix F.68 254- The Government of India in reporting Colonel Ross's proceedings to the Secretary of State (despatch No. 19, dated 14th February 1881) observed 'This specific project has not again been brought forward) but there is still some reason to suspect that endeavours are being made to extend Turkish influence in the island ; and the Resident in the Persian Gulf now thinks it desirable to strengthen the hands of the Chief by taking from him the agreement a draft of which is enclosed in this despatch. Under the provisions of this agreement the Chief binds himself not to have any dealings with foreign Powers without the consent of the British Government, and not to allow the establishment of agencies or coal depots in his territory. Colonel Ross is of opinion that the existence of such an understanding will be convenient to the Chief by enabling him, to decline, without difficulty or offence, any overtures made to him, not only on the part of the Turks, but on the part of other Powers whose attention is now being turned to the affairs of the Gulf. Sheikh Esau appears to take the same view of the matter, and he has signed the draft agreement, being however clearly informed by the Resident that it would have to be submitted for the sanction of the Government of India. Under the circumstances it appears to be desirable that the agreement should be accepted and ratified. It will not materially increase or alter the existing responsibilities of the British Government in regard to Bahrein, and its refusal now might be misunder stood. But the Resident will be informed that it is, as a rule, inexpedient that political officers should enter into such negotiations, however guardedly, without special instruc tions. We have the honour to request that we may be favored with an early reply to this despatch '. 354A. The agreement was duly approved by the Secretary of State.69 CHAPTER XXV. (i) Outrages against British Indians under Jasim's instigations. (2) Sheikh Jasim made to pay a fine. (3) Turkish protest against British proceedings and their own designs against Bahrein,— 1887—1888. 255. In May 1887, Sheikh Jasim announced that he had left Bidaa and its government, and was no longer respon- External A., March .888, Nos. .58.306, ^ {or ^ affairs o{ Katar he remarked, ' are now first referred to God and then to the Turkish Government.' Reports sent by Colonel Ross in July 1887 showed that the Sheikh's withdrawal from Bidaa had been followed by disorder there, and disturbances in the neigh bourhood. The bazaar of Bidaa was plundered by the Beni Hajir ; and certain Persian traders, who had incurred Sheikh Jasim's displeasure, suffered ; but the Hindu traders were protected by the Sheikh's relatives. The attack was attri buted by the Political Resident to the Sheikh's influence. Early in August, Colonel Ross telegraphed that two Indian traders had been ' wantonly wounded at Bidaa by Arabs,' and that there had been several practical outrages on the Katar Coast. Several Bahrein and Persian vessels were plundered by pirates. The Resident had the Indian traders at Bidaa removed, and H. M. S. O. Osprey went to Bahrein. From the first the Resident regarded Sheikh Jasim as respon sible, and this impression was confirmed by enquiries made by the First Assistant Resident and by Colonel Ross himself. The latter telegraphed on the 21st August—' I consider compensation should be exacted from Jasim for wounds ancf losses of British Indian traders and plunder of Bahrein and Persian vessels by pirates, and fine imposed in addition.' With this view Colonel Ross got tho Chief of Bahrein to ' lay an embargo' upon specie and pearls belonging to Sheikh Jasim at Bahrein, aggregating Rs. 20,000 in value. On the 23rd August, the Resident followed up his telegram with a letter, which was emphatic in fixing responsibility upon Sheikh Jasim. Referring to the Bahrein Chief's attachment of Jasim's property, the Resident remarked :— f&lt; If Government should approve of my proposal to exact compensation from Jasim this seizure may obviate the necessity of employing naval force. If that recommendation should not be adopted, the property can be returned to Jasim's Agent.' In the next letter of any importance, dated the 10th September, the Resi dent reported on his measures for checking piracies : he did not anticipate any more. He also mentioned that the— 'Commandant of the Turkish troops in Hasa came Ojair with about eight gen darmes and proceeded to Bidaa, where he was in constant consultation with Jasim and other notables.' 256. Colonel Ross' letter, dated the Wth September, forwarded communi cations addressed by Sheikh Jasim to a merchant at Basrah and to the Valis of Basrah and Baghdad, are dated the 25th August, complaining of the seizure by Colonel Ross, of ' all' the Sheikh's property in Bahrein, a measure which they said was the result of the Sheikh's subjection to the Turkish Government. The Sheikh appealed to the Valis against the action of the Resident. 257. There were received then telegrams from the Resident— (a) The telegram of the 3rd October, stated that the Porte had tele graphed to the Basrah Wali for a detailed report on recent events and British action as to Katar. Colonel Ross asked, ' When may I expect decision regarding same ?' (^) The telegram of 4th October said—' Governor of Hasa addressed Bahrein Chief threatening letter demanding release (of) Jasim's property, I dont't know if under higher authority, probably not.', (^) Telegram of the 6th October said—' Jasim agrees to pay British and Bahrein claims and I hope to settle the business accordingly amicably. 1 would not press fine.' [943 fd ]7° 258. On the 15th October 1887, the Political Resident telegraphed that . . . ^ ^ , Sheikh lasim had laid up all British and Artie e 206 01 demi-official, i • i • r j • • Bahrein claims tor outrages and piracies at Katar Coast, that his property under detention had been released, and that piracies were stopped so far as Jasim's jurisdiction went and that British relations were placed on former friendly footing. The Government of India expressed their satisfaction at this happy result. 259. The proceedings of the Political Resident in exacting the compensa- _ f ,a c . u 000 kt o&lt;o tion from Sheikh Jasim in October 1887 External A., September 1888, Nos 38 -68. 111 c 1 t -» • 1 1 reached the ears of the rorte, with the result that a note of protest was sent to the British Ambassador. Her Majesty's Government on 17th April 1888 inyited Sir W. White's attention to the views expressed by them in 1883, namely, that Her Majesty's No 8^ of ditto Government are not prepared to waive the right which ihey have exercised at inter' vals during a long period of years of dealing directly with the A y ab Chiefs of the Katar coast when necessary in order to preserve the peace of the seas or to obtain for outrages on British subjects, or on persons entitled to British Protection. The despatch added :— Her Majesty's Government continue to hold that view and they are equally unable to admit any claim of the Porte to jurisdiction over the Chief of Bahrein, whom, as they have once intimated, they regard as an independent ruler and with whom they are on treaty relations' 259A. While the Ottoman Government showed themselves so sensitive Extract A., August .888, Nos. 447-482. a , bout British interference in Bahrein affairs, there was no doubt in the minds of our officers in the Gulf that the main object of the movements of Turkish troops to Katif and Katar about this time, ostensibly for the purpose of sunpressing pira cies (see paras. 126-127 of Katar Precis), was to obtain a footing in Bahrein. The Persians were also taking measures to assert their sovereignty over Bahrein at this time (vide Chapter XXVII port). The Resident in the Gulf therefore is ibi d&gt; No 453. despatched two vessels of war to Bahrein with orders to prevent any hostile attempt to land by the Turks, Arabs or Persians, The Grand Vizir was also requested by Sir A. Sandiron, under orders from Extract a., September 1888, Nos. 38-68. Sir W. White, that the Turkish authorities (No ' 42 ^ should he receive strict orders to abstain from every kind of interference at Bahrein and was also informed that the British man of war which was then there had orders to prevent any landing of ArabSy Persians or Turks. His Highness replied that there was no intention whatever of sending Turkish troops to the island, and seemed indisposed, for the moment at least, to urge the Porte's pretended claim of soveriegnty. If was, however, apprehended that the Minfster for Foreign affairs was likely to show a very different disposition in this matter, more especially in regard to the question of sovereignty. In fact from what we shall read hereafter, it will be seen that the Porte has never abandoned its claim.V CHAPTER XXVI. Supercilious Style of Turkish communications to the Chief of • Bahrein, 1888. 260. The local Turkish officers of Hasa always took a domineering tone of a suprior officer towards the Chief of Bahrein. In addressing letters to him in matters of extradition of absconding debters or criminals, they wrote as if ordering a subordinate official. On the envelope of such letters the address Externa.! A, August 1888. No S , S-.o. ^ Wr0te often WaS ' The Sheikh ^6 etc. This the Mutassarif of Hasa also did once in communicating with the Chief in regard to the arrangements made by the Turkish authorities for the protection of pilgrims proceeding by way of Hasa to Mecca. The Political Resident in bringing this fact to the notice of Government (Letter No. 211, dated 6th July 1888) observed : ' It is difficult to see how the Bahrein Chief can, with due regard to his dignity, notice such communications so addressed and couched in the language of a superior addressing a subordinate official.' 261. When another communication was made by the Mutassarif of Hasa to External A., September 1888, Nos. 131-123. the Chief of Bahrein with a similar slighting style of address in August 1888, Colonel Ross thought that though there was no use making any representation to the Government of Basrah, yet he would tell the Chief verbally when he should next, see him, that he would be justified in refusing letters bearing objectionable addresses (Letter No. 253, dated 23rd August 1888.) 262. This style of addressing the Chief at Bahrein, it appears, originated from an order of the Governor of Basrah, in which it was ruled that the proper name of the island of Bahrein was Awal. ' 262A. It appears that the Turkish authorities had been shewn some ancient Gulf Administration Report 1887-88. maps (such as NIebuhr'sj, on which the name ' Bahrein ' was shewn as co exten sive with Hasa, and the Turks proposed to revive this supposed ancient applica tion of the name to the province of Hasa, in order to strengthen their theory that the occupation of Hasa constructively carried with it a right of sovereignty over the islands of Bahrein. ' Awal', it may be here explained, was the distinc tive name of the largest Bahrein island, and the word was by some authorities considered as derived from an Arab conqueror, Awal-ibn-Rabiah, by others from the name of an idol worshipped by the tribes ' Bekr' and ' Taghlib,' of which dol there may have been a sanctuary or temple in Bahrein.72 CHAPTER XXVIL ! The question of the Persian claim to sovereignty over Bahrein reopened, 1885—1886. 263. While these Turkish intrigues were going on the Persians also wished to assert their old claims to Bahrein. In External a., June 1866, Nos. 84 -85. December 1885, it was reported by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Colonel Ross) that the Chief of Bahrein had been alarmed by a rumour that a correspondence had passed between the English and Persian Governments regarding the claim of the latter to the island. The Resident reassured the Chief, and the Government of India heard nothing more of the matter. 264. In September 1886, the Shah asked Mr. Nicolson (His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran) to com- Secret e., December 1886, No. 43-48. municate to Her Majesty's Government his wishes to establish his authority over Bahrein. The points to be noted in the verbal message communicated through the Foreign Minister are as follows :— (1) The Shah wished to establish his authority effectually over the island either by sending a Governor or by instituting the Sheikh as the representative of the Persian Government. (2) The Shah would wish that the maritime police should continue in the hands of the British naval forces, and lastly (3) he considered that the London Foreign Office letter to the Persian Minister at the Court of St. James dated April 29th, 1869, re cognized his sovereignty over the island (see paragraph 74 ante), Mr. Nicolson replied that he would communicate the wishes of the Shah to Her Majesty's Governmsnt, but expressed no opinion. 265. No reason was assigned for this apparently sudden desire on the . .. qq .. ^ . part of the Shah to revive his lon^ dormant E - Ap ;' ' 887 ' NoB - 54 - 6o - A - claim on Bahrein. Mr. Nicolson had no doubt that it had been prompted by the Russians, though he was at a loss to say, whether it was done with a view to create a little soreness between the British and the Shah, or with a desire to see the island placed in the weak hands of the Persian Government or for some other reason (see his demi-official dated 28th September 1886). 266. It was decided by Her Majesty's Government to inform the Shah that Nos. 45-46 in Secret E , December 18S6, Nos.

The proposal was not however communicated by Mr. Nicolson to the c * 1? a -s q 0 m ^ a Shah's Government, as the matter had not Secret E., April 18S7, Nos s4-6o -A. . . 1 • . 1 1 , , been mentioned, since it had been broached, and unless it should again be referred to, he proposed to let the matter drop.

We had to mention above* the ill-treatment and plunder of Persian and • Paragraph 255. Indian traders at Bidaa, and we have seen External a., August 1888. Nos. 447-482. w hat action was taken by the British Gov ernment as regards the Indian traders. As regards the Persian subjects, the Shah of Persia asked the British Charge d'Affaires at Tehran early in October 1887 whether we could assist him in procuring restitution of the property said to have come to 30,000 tomans taken from them by Jasim-bin-Thani. The British Charge d'Affaires enquired of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf whether this was possible. The latter's reply, dated 6th October 1887, was— Our relations with Jasim are just now in a critical state, but I hope to come to amicable settlement regarding British claims very soon, after that if Shah or Persian Gov ernment wishes I might be able to assist and would gladly make an attempt.' 269. The Persian Government (at this time controlled by Amin-es-Sultan) then proceeded to take the matter in their own hands, apparently after some understanding with the Turks. They found ready tools in one Malek-et-Tujjar, who signed himself as ' Governor in the Persian Gulf,' and the Persian General Haji Ahmad Khan. The ambition of these two men inspired by Amin-es-Sultan was not merely to exact compensation from Sheikh Jasim, but under cover of this ostensible object, to take advantage of the disturbed condition of affairs on the Pirate Coast, in Katarand Bahrein, to establish the Persian control over the Sheikhs of those places. Accordingly on the one hand we find Haji Ahmad Khan sailing in February 1888 with 150 soldiers to the Pirate Coast and attempting, though, without success, to hoist the Persian flag at Ras-ul-Kheymah, Um-el- Koweyn and Shargah and to induce the Chiefs of those places to accept the Persian protection. On the other hand Malek was busy intriguing towards Bahrein side. He received a telegram from Amin-es-Sultan to say that the Persian Government were in correspondence with the Turkish ambassador about the Persian claim against Sheikh Jasim that the assurances should be given to the Persian subjects, who had grievances against him. Malek was also reported to have received telegrams from some disaffected Bahreinese offering assistance if he would undertake annexation of the island to Persia. 270.

Great importance seems to have been attached to these measures which obviously indicate preparing for an anticipated clashing of interests.

The island of Bahrein being separated by onlv a narrow channel from the Arabian Coast of Hasa and Katif, criminals and insolvent debtors find abundant facilities for fleeing the hand of justice and absconding^ across the waters. And having regard to the hostile attitude of the Turkish officials against the Chief of Bahrein, difficulties would naturally be raised by them to extradition of such persons absconding from Bahrein to the Arabian Coast. On the other hand the Chief of Bahrein, finding so little inclination on the part of the Turks for mutual reciprocity, could not be expected to cheerfully accede to their demands for extradition offenders absconding from the Turkish territory to Bahrein couched as these demands were often in supercilious style. We shall quote here a few instances which have come to the notice of Government. 272. Colonel Ross submitted, with his letter No. 335, dated 30thSeptem ber 1879, for information, correspondence Pol. a, November 1879, Nos. 582.588. vvith Sheikh Esau bin All, and between that Chief and the Turkish officials of Hasa and Katif. From this correspondence it appears that the Turkish authorities asked Sheikh Esau bin Ali, Chief of Bahrein, to surrender one Abdullah Sadeyr, accused of murder. Acting under advice previously given by Colonel Ross, the Chief surrendered this man, and then wrote informing Colonel Ross that he had done so, and asking advice as to the steps he should take with rjgard to debtors who abscond from Bahrein to Turkish territory. 273. In reply to this reference, the Resident referred him to his letter of 16th April for his views on the general subject of extradition, and infoimed the Chief that he might properly apply to the Turkish authorities, stating particulars If the Chief should send him a list of^such claims, he (Resident) would ascertain the sentiments of the Turkish authorities. 274. In the letter referred to, dated 16th April 1879, the Resident writes to the Chief:— 4&lt; I am of opinion that, as a general rule, in view to friendly relations with the Turkish Government, present and future, and to reciprocal good offices, you should conform to the usages of other States in such matters, and should not give asylum in Bahrein to persons guilty of crimes in Turkish territory, or who have absconded in a fraudulent way with money or goods.' 275. In his letter No. 153, dated 26th April 1879, in which the above was enclosed, the resident writes :— 41 The remark of His Excellency (the Governor of Busrah) to Mr. Robertson as to the status of Bahrein shows the necessity of caution in advising the Chief of Bahrein to any action which would seem to compromise the independence of his Governmentj and I do not believe he would agree to surrender the person referred to unless distinctly advised by the representative of the Government of India to do so. 276. The remark of the Governor is thus recorded by Mr. Robertson :— ' He remarked, however, in a general way, that the customs of independent nations did not apply in dealings with the Sheikh of Bahrein, meaning no doubt that the Sheikh was properly a feudatory of the Sultan.' 277. The Government of India's orders were as follows (letter No. 2570-E.P., dated 15th November 1879. I am directed to acknowledge your letter, No. 335, dated 30th September 1879, for warding a copy of a letter to your address from Shaikh Esau-bin-Ali, Chief of Bahrein, [C943FD] T78 dated I5tli September, with accompaniments, and of your reply thereto, on the subject of the extradition of a criminal demanded by the Turkish authorities, and the Sheikh's claim to reciprocity in regard to debtors absconding from his territory. 2. In reply, I am to observe that the extradition of debtors, especially when the persons concerned are not fraudulent debtors, has been agreed to by very few States, and very great caution should be exercised in making demands for such extradition. The Government of India, therefore, consider that in demanding the surrender of debtors in return for the surrender of a man accused of murder, the Chief of Bahrein has stretched the principle of reciprocity too far. 3. I am further to say that, in the opinion of the Government of India, the Chief of Bahrein ought to be discouraged, as far as possible, from entering into direct correspondence with the 1 urkish authorities, and should be encouraged on all occassions to look to vou to act for him in matters in which the Turks are concerned. Therefore the concluding portion of your letter of 30th September to bheikh Esau-bin Ali, in which you direct him to send you list of his claims, that you may ascertain the sentiments of the Turkish authori ties on them, is approved. 278. In 1880 there was another case of a criminal being demanded by the rd. A. juiy ,8So, Nos. 315-230. I u , rki ? h authorities from the Chief of Bahrein. In this case the Vakil of the Kaim Makam of Katif wrote to the Chief of Bahrein and demanded the surrender, in the name of the authorities of Nejd, of a man named ' Mahomed.' No reasons were given, so the Bahrein Chief replied that no mention of his fault was made, hence he had not been seized, but that security had been taken for him. 279. The News Agent at Bahrein reported that there was a great robbery committed in Katif, and that one of the robbers caught named this man ' Mahomed' as an accomplice—such is the report. Colonel Ross considered that the proceedings of the Katif Governor irregular, and it would be advisable that demands for extradition should not be preferred by the local Turkish authori ties, but that the latter should apply in such cases to the chief authority in '1 urkish Arabia. 279. Tl^e Government of India stated in reply (letter No. 2369-E.P., dated 1 5ih July 1880.) i,* 2 Z- 11 re P^' ^ am observe that, in the opinion of the Government of India, a request of this kind for extradition does not seem to touch the question of the independence of the Mate to which application is made, but rather admits its independence. So long, therefore, as Sheikh Esau-bin-Ali of Bahrein refers to you before acting in doubtful cases, His Excellency the Governor,General in Council does not desire to modify the instructions conveyed to 3on in the letter from this Office, No. 2570 E.P. of 15th November 1879. 3. With reference to paragraph 2 of your letter, I am to say that it would pppear that ! Ip insis ted that such demands should be made through the chief Turkish authority in i urkish Arabia, such a course would necessitate their being always preferred by the lurks through British officers. Should this system prevail the result might become in convenient, as the Turkish Government would probably look to us for satisfaction if their demands were disregarded. 280. In November 1887, anative of Bahrein, Ali-bin-Mahomed, was reported External A., March 18S8, No». 370-374. to hav&lt; r cheated a British Indian subject Gu- ... lab bin Madan, residing at Bahrein, by pledging a parcel of sham parcel of the sum of Rs. 3.300 and absconded to Katif. The matter was reported, through the British Consul at Basrah, to the Vali of Basrah, with request that he would cause enquiries to be made at Katif, where the circumstances would be well known, and that if the swindler should be found there, his extradition to Bahrein for trial might be ordered. wpllifr l 11 T r th l e F 1 orei ^ Department that it would have been well if Colonel Ross had brought the matter officially to Colonel Tweedie's c^olT w «?p::Lr rtedittotheBritish Embassy at c —^10.^ject 79 283. In December 1889, the Mutassarif of Hasa wrote to the Chief of external a., february 1890, Nos. 288 -299. Bahrein stating that two Arabs Saad-bin- Abdullah and Mahomed-hin-Abdullah, who had murdered a woman in Hasa, had fled to Bahrein, The Chief of Bahrein in forwarding the Mutassarif's letter reported to the Political Resident that the men were not in the island, and was thanked for forwarding the letter for the Poli tical Resident's perusal and advised to inform the Mutassarif of the circum stances. 2S3. In August 1890, the Kaimakam of Katif and Seyyed Mustafa addressed External A., OcoW .890, Ko,. 42.49. ? he f B£ ; hrein ? inSolent . letter ' in which he demanded the extradition of an Arab Sheikh, Abdul Rahman of Seyhet, who it was alleged had been indebted the Turkish Government and had absconded in order to evade payment of his debt. The Chief in forwarding this letter complained that the emissary of Kaimakam were insolent in their tone to him. He also pointed that the Turkish officials while demanded surrender of men absconding from Hasa to Bahrein and that in an insolent manner, disregarded his own applications for surrender of people absconding from Bahrein to the Turkish territory. The Chief informed the Kaimakam's agent that the absconding Sheikh was not in Bahrein. An attempt was then made to arrest two dependents of this Sheikh, but this attempt was prevented by the Chief's men. 284. Colonel Ross in reporting the facts to Government expressed the opinion that the action of Seyyed Mustafa was certainly very insolent, but as the Chief seemed to have been to deal with the case so as to avoid suffering practical indignity, nothing would be gained by referring the matter to higher authorities. 285. Sheikh Abdurrahim was found in September 1890 at Bushire, where External A., October .89a, No..32,. 3.3. telegraphed his complaints to the Porte direct. Ihe dispute it appears was of a political nature. He returned soon after to Bahrein, where he received a conci liatory message from Seyyed Mustafa, requesting him to return to Katif. The Sheikh replied that he had left Katif on account of illegal proceedings of Turkish officers and would only return if safe conduct would be promised him. 286. As regards the attitude to be taken by the British Government in such cases, Colonel Ross informed the Chief:— No. 46 of proceedings cited. (t It appears that you have dealt with the matter as requisite, but should circumstances arise in which you require support in maintaining your authority intact and independent, you may rely on my taking the necessary action?* 287. In June 1891, the Mutassarif of Hasa asked the Chief of Bahrein External a,, Februarv isgt, Nos. 174-176. in a polite letter for the surrender of 28 persons, who were said to have absconded to join Sheikh Abdurrahim in order to evade payment of Government dues. The Chief sent the letter to Colonel Ross, but it is not apparent what action was taken. 1 i « \ t; '8o CHAPTER XXX. Claim of Ahmed-bin-AIi (brother) of Chief of Bahrein against Ahmed- bin-Mahdi, 1886—1889. 288. The facts of this case are briefly:— Ahmed-bin-AIi bought 10,000 killas of dates from Ahmed-bin-Mahdi at m c ♦ 1 a kjt cqo tvt krans per killa, equivalent to a total No 96, External A., May 1888, Nos. 93-in. ^ r ^ i i i- value of Ks. 10,000, and delivery was promised at this rate, when the time for the delivery arrived. When dates became ripe, price of dates had advanced and were at 6J krans per killa. Ahmed-bin-Mahdi on this delivered over only 4,71 7 killas of dates, instead of 10,000. Ahmed-bin-AIi now claimed 5,283 killas of dates at 6J krans per killa. 289. The claim was forwarded to the Resident in May 1886, through the Residency Agent at Bahrein, who pointed out that reports stated Ahmed-bin- Mahdi to be well able to pay the claim, but being in with Turkish officials at Katif he was able to resist the demand. 1 his complaint was forwarded by Colonel Miles to Colonel Tweedie in May 1886, and no reply having been received, a reminder was sent in September 1886. Colonel Tweedie replied in October to the effect that he had addressed to the Assistant Political Agent at Basrah, enlisting his good offices in the case. 290. In November Surgeon-Major Bowman, in charge of Baghdad Residency, wrote that he quite concurred with Mr. Robertson in thinking that Sheikh Ahmed-bin-AIi should prefer his claim before a judicial court, Turkish, and requested that Sheikh Ahmed should be informed in that sense. 291. Being unable to concur in this view which assumed the existence or courts which, if existent, were not available to the Bahrein Sheikh, Colonel Ross explained the _ difficulty, and further action was taKen, first informally, by the Assistant Political Agent at Basrah with the concurrence of Colonel Tweedie Promises were obtained from the Vali of Basrah and other local officials there* but nothing came of them. ' 2Q2. Eventually Mr. Robertson, in June 1887, addressed the Vali of Basrah officially on the subject, and has since continued to press for a settlement. 293. At the suggestion of Colonel Ross the Chief of Bahrein deputed an External A., August 1888, Nos. 5-7. Agent on behalf of his brother to Mutas- • 1 . . . , . sar ^ Hasa to represent the case but the representation received no consideration. •A 2 94- The dilBculties m arriving at an easy settlement were there.

Thev attempted to recruit for the army persons calling themselves Bahreinese in Basrah and Abdul Khasib. This was brought to the notice of the British Consulate in 1890, and the report of Lieutenant Straton, No. 271, dated 17th June 1890, to the Resident at Baghdad may be read :— / j ^ » ' l have the honour to state that it appears the Turkish Government here are trvins to recruit persons, calling themselves Bahreinese, residing in Bassorah and Abdul Khasib'for military service. It is rumoured that several such persons have been to the Persian Consul-General here and have claimed protection and exemption from enlistment under Turkish colors, alleging that Bahrein used to be under the Persian Government. It is said that the Persian Consul-General is representing the master to the Persian Embassy at Constantinople. I am informed that some of tne leading Bahrein people here are making secret enquiries to ascertain whether the British Government would interfere on their behalf, and whether it would be advisable to present themselves at the British Consulate. There are supposed to be from 5 to 6,000 natives of Bahrein resident here, but I have no certain information regarding their nationality. Probabiy the Local Government here would assert them to be Turkish subjects, and possibly the aftair may be of the nature of a trick to evade military service. I would, however, be glad to have your general instructions on the following points for my guidance:— &amp; r I. Whether I should afford any encouragement to the idea that persons claiming to belong to Bahrein should naturally seek protection at this Consulate; and II. What action should I take in case such persons apply to me with or without such encouragement.' 295.B. Colonel Tweedie consulted Colonel Cross, whose opinion on the points raised is quoted below ' Our relations with the Government of Bahrein are such that the Chief of the islands has a claim on our Government for good offices in matters affecting the interests of his dona fide subjects, when they may be involved in difficulties under the jurisdiction of powers such as Turkey and Persia, for the Chief of Bahrein is in a measure debarred from direct communication with Foreign Governments. If therefore the Chief of Bahrein should apply to us on behalf of his subjects his application would have to be considered, but in absence of such appeal I do not think, as a rule, that direct applications from persons calling themselves Bahreinese should be enter tained. I would therefore advise a reply to recent Stratton in the sense that he should give no encouragement to that class of persons to apply to him, and that in case of appli cation being made he should refer applicants to their own Government in the first instance. . so-called Bahreinese who claim Persian protection are from that act disloyal to their own Chief, and would have no claim on his or on our sympathy. I think probably Sheikh Easu would not care to interest himself on behalf of the sot -dtsant Bahreinese of Basorah, and unless he did we would have no ground for inter ference. &amp; 295-C. No orders were passed on this correspondence by the Government of India, as it was deemed questionable whether the persons claiming to be subjects of Bahrein were really such, and until the Sheikh called for our interven tion, no action was needed. [C943FD]82 CHAPTER XXXII. Agreement concluded by the Chief of Bahrein, 1892. 296. Major Talbot, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, reported in his letter , ^ No. 167, dated loth October 1892 :— Secret E., July 1892, Nos. 34-45. ' ' It will be in the recollection of Government that in 1887, in consequence of the intrigues of certain Persian officials on the Arab Coast, my predecessor thought it desirable to obtain written assurances from the Trucial Chiefs that they would not enter into any agreement with another Power, nor permit a foreign agent to reside in their territories without the assent of the British Government, while they also declared their adhesion to previous engagements. These documents were forwarded to Govern ment with my predecessor's letter No. 13, dated 13th January 1888, but no replv seems to have been received, and as they have not been ratified they may not be technically binding agreements. In any case, however, I would suggest for consideration that it might be advisable to amplify these assurances by the conclusion of a fresh agreement embodying a provision against the cession by the Chiefs of any portion of their territories to any Fewer but England. In my letter No. 152, dated 15th September 1891 I referred to the mischievous activity of Chapui and his partner, and I have since heard from the Residency Agent at Lingah that the Chief of Um-ul-Kawain has granted them a piece of land near his own residence. This report still awaits confirmation by the Agent at Shargah, but is not impro bable as M. Chapui appears to have ingratiated himself with the Sheikh. It may be urged that M. Chapui is a mere adventurer, intriguing for his own ends, and that his actions, if overtly directed against us, would be promptly disavowed by the French Government; but I venture to think that it would be well to guard against the chance of his receiving any encouragerilent from his own Government; to which he will, doubtless, misrepresent the extent of his influence on the Arab Coast and the advantages to be gained by supporting him. Apart, moreover, from the question as affected by the actions of M. Chapui and the Chief of Um-ul-Kawain, it would seem desirable in view of the recent attitude of the Porte with regard to Odeid to anticipate pretexts for any sort of interference by the Ottoman Government in the territories of the Trucial Chiefs. With the view I submit a draft agreement, and I have included in it the substance of the one negotiated in 1887, for even if valid as it stands it only applies to the Chiefs then in power and does not bind their successors.' 297. The draft agreement proposed by Major Talbot was approved by the No. 32. Government of India with slight amenda- ^ „ , , tions (Foreign Department letter No. I'n C. C., dated 24th November 1891.) 298. Major Talbot after obtaining agreements from all the Trucial Chiefs induced also the Chief of Bahrein to sign one on 13th March 1892 which is printed as Appendix G. 298A. In March 1893 the Turkish Ambassador at London requested that Secret e ., May 1893, Nos. 165—168. be furnished with the text of our ^ lr T , „ , , treaties with the Arab Chiefs of the Persian U U Rosebery consulted the India Office. The Earl of Kimberly replied that the text of the agreements of 1892 with the Trucial Chiefs on the Pirate Coast might be. communicated to the Porte. This does not show whether the agreement of 1 892 with the Chief of Bahrein was also communicated or not to the lurkish Government.f'' U'j 83 CHAPTER XXXI11. Various acts of Turkish Assertion of Sovereignty over Bahrein, 1892-93. 299. In the year 1892-93, we find the Turks were very active in asserting their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein. We shall note here the several instances in which this was done. 300. In December 1892, information reached the British Consul at Basrah (1) Apprehended Turkish attack on Bahrein, that the Porte had ordered the Vali to December 1 ^. consider Bahrein as Turkish territory. The No. 217 of Secret E., May 1853, Nos. 207-2(5 ij t 7 r ^ t , Vah was at or near Hasa at the time with 500 troops. 1 he Political Agent apprehending the landing of Turkish troops informed the Senior Naval officer that he should take action to prevent the landing of Turkish troops. The Government of India in telegraphing the facts to the Secretary of State on 6th December referred to Lord Cross's telegram of January 1888, and proposed to approve of this action of the Political Resident. 301. The action of the Resident was duly approved by Her Majesty's Nos. 218 and Secret e.. May ,893 Nos. 207-261. Government, and Lord Rosebury also in- 2 4'- structed Sir F. C. Ford to express to the Porte the hope that the report was without foundation and if necessary to state that Her Majesty's ships will oppose any attempt to land troops. 302. On the 9th of December 1892 the Turkish Ambassador made a comp- (a) Turkish complaint against alleged British laint tO the Foreign Office, the purport of excluding free commercial intercourse of other which WaS aS follows : nations with Bahrein, December 1892. » His Excellency stated that the maintenance of friendly and commercial relations between No. 221 of Secret E., May 1893, Nos. 207-261. tlie Turkish Coast on that Gulf and the ports of Arabia between Oman aud Bahrein was a matter of great difficulty owing to the attitude of the local Sheikhs, and that this was said to be due to the fact that the British officials in those parts, on the strength of Conventions concluded at one time between the British Government and the predecessors of these Chiefs with a view to the prevention of the slave trade, had exacted pledges from them not to enter into relations with the subjects of any other Power nor to allow their boats to ply on the coasts in question. 303. This was communicated to the India Office, and the following letter No. 93. dated 30th December 1892 expresses the views of Earl of Kimberley on the matter:— ' 1° reply, I am desired to call attention to Sir H. Walpole's letter of the 30th June 1891, which forwarded copies of the new agreements entered into by the six trucial Chiefs on the pirate Coast of the Persian Gulf, and by the Chief of Bahrein with the British Government. It will be seen that by the second article of these engagements the signato ries have engaged that without the assent of the British Government, they will not consent to the residence within their territories of the Agent of any other Government, but this stipulation does not debar them from having commercial dealings with the Turkish Govern ment or any other Power. In August 1891, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople communicated to the Sublime Pcrte a copy of the Convention with these Trucial Chiefs known as the Maritime 1 ruce of 1853. Lord Kimberly, however, would not recommend that tlie new engage ments above mentioned should be communicated to the Turkish Government, but would su SS es ^ that the lurkish Ambassador should be informed in general terms that the nature of our engagements with the Trucial Chiefs does not debar the subject of the Porte from entering into commercial relations with the tribes on the Arabian Coast subject to these Chiefs.'* J 304. The reply given by Lord Rosebury to the Turkish Ambassador was that the engagements entered into between Her Majesty's Government and the Chiefs in question are not of a nature to preclude the subjects of the Porte from having commercial relations with the tribes subject to those Chiefs' 305.

The^ Political Resident received further confirmation of the action of the Turkish officials in compelling Bahrein subjects to accept Turkish flags from various other sources. . 307. On a reference made by the India Office to the Foreign Office, the Political Resident's message of 10th January 1892, was repeated on 19th January to Sir C. Ford, and it was added :— ' Inform the Porte that as Turkish local authorities disregard the orders, they must have received in consequence of representation made by you at the Porte, it will be necessary tor the Government of India to give to the Chief of Bahrein such material support as mav be required to resist the interference of Turkish local authorities with his subjects,' 308.

The Viceroy wired to the Secretary of State on 22nd June 1893 ' Colonel Mockler's instructions to Lieutenant Beville have already been approved by us. But we should be glad, if the Porte were cautioned against sending Turkish troons en route to Katar to Bahrein, even for transhipment, as this arrangement might cause inconvenience hereafter.' 313. Under instructions from Her Majesty's Government the Porte was then informed by Sir A. Nicolson that they could nd permit the transhipment oj Ottoman troops in Bahrein waters. [C943FD]86 CHAPTER XXXIV. OccupatiJn of Zobarah by Al-bin-Ali tribe with support of the Turks and Sheikh Jasim. Threatened attack on Bahrein. Energetic measures taken in expelling the settlement, 1895. 314. Information was received in the month of May 1895 from the Po- „ „ , litical Resident in the Persian Gulf that secret E, October .893, No.. f4-.S5. the Al -bin -Ali tribe under Sheikh Sultan- bin-Salema had deserted from the Chief of Bahrein, to whom they were subject, and were forming a settlement on the opposite coast at Zobarah, with the support of Sheikh Jasim of Bidaa. This support was considered to be a menace to Bahrein. 315. A warning was addressed to Sheikh Jasim that this would not be allowed. The Resident reported, however, that a Turkish official, the Mutassarif of Hasa, had gone to Zobarah, and that the settlement was being pushed on, Sheikh Jasim acting in concert with the Mutassarif, who was preparing to hoist the Turkish flag. 316. On report of the facts to the India Office, Her Majesty's Ambassa dor at Constantinople was instructed to call the attention of the Turkish Gov ernment to the matter, and to state that the formation of a settlement at Zobarah would constitute a menace to Bahrein and that if the proceedings complained of were allowed to continue, the Government of India would be compelled to take measures for the protection of the Chief of that island. 317. After the lapse of sufficient interval Her Majesty's ship Sphinx commanded by Captain Pelley proceeded to Zobarah and desired Sheikh Sultan to return with his tribe to Bahrein. The Sheikh absolutely refused to comply with this order, and seven of the boats were therefore seized. A Turkish offi cial, appointed the Mudir of Zobarah by the Porte, protested generally, claim ing Zobarah as Turkish territory, and the Al-bin-Ali as having come under Turkish protection. 318. Onthe^ 15th July Her Majesty's ship Sphinx seized nine boats, together with Salim, an important Al-bin-Ali, who had become reconciled with the Bahrein Chief, but the Bahrein boats sent for Salim's family were detained by the new Turkish Mudir at Zobarah. 319. The Resident subsequently reported that the Al-bin-Ali had become reconciled with the Chief of Bahrein, but the Mudir was interfering, that he claimed the Al-bin-Ali tribe settled at Zobarah, as Turkish subjects and declar ed Bahrein tin conditionally, and Katar in part, as within the Ottoman dominions. The Resident further reported that the Mutassarif had collected a force at Katif, and that, although he stated that it was for the purpose of an expedition into Nejd, apprehensions were felt that an attack on Bahrein was in contempla tion. These apprehensions were strengthened by the fact that Sheikh Jasim had collected a large number of boats. The Turkish boat Zuhaf was also found cruising along the Katar coast. % 320. In these circumstances the Government of India proposed (18th Pro. No. 134 of Secret e ., October 1895, Nos. 64- August) that a demonstration against Bah- ,5S ' , . rein might be resisted by fire, if the Com mander first satisfied himself that the fleet advancing was hostile, and that if it came under Turkish colours explanations must be demanded and if not satisfactory, warning should be given that an advance within 3 miles would be Pro. No. 1360! Secret e ., October 1895 No* resisted by fire. The Secretary of State 64-1 ' 5 ' approved of these proposals. 331. The Pigeon was ordered to Bahrein on 17th August and arrangements Nos. 133 to 138 of Secret e ., October 1896, Nos. were also made for despatching a regiment 55 or w i n g of native infantry from Bombay87 to Bahrein by the Canning. This arrangement was subsequently cancelled Secret e ., October 1895, Nos. 336-381. as n0 troo P s were needed, but the Plassey was ordered to proceed to Zobarah in addition to the Pegion. 322. As regards the Political Resident's report that the Mudir of Zobarah Pro No 369 of Secret E., October 1895, N OS. had declared Bahrein unconditionallv and M ' 3 j. . u ... , . , Katar as partly, subject to Ottoman jurisdiction, Her Majesty s Ambassador by direction of the Foreian Office addressed a remonstance to the Porte (dated 12th August 1895) on theVoceed- ings of their local officers in-Katar coast, over which Htr Majesty's Government do not recognize Turkish jurisdiction and informed them that all Turkish claims to Bahrein, which is under the- protection of the Queen of England were totally inadmissible and that measures would be taken to protect the Island from aggression. Pro. No. 56 of Secret e., February 1897, Nos. 323. Again a memorandum was . 57 5 communicated to the Turkish Ambassador in London on 32nd August 1895 ln which it was stated / ' His Majesty's Government do not admit that the part of the coast (Katar coast) is under 1 urkish jurisdiction and they have several times given notice of this to the Turkish Government and have notified to them that Bahrein is under British protection:' It was also added that the above mentioned contention of the Mudir of Zobarah could not in any way be admitted. 324. The Mutassarif of Hasa wrote to the Political Resident on the loth Pro. No. 149, oiSecret E., Ociober 1895, Nos.64.

He also advised the release by force of Bahrein boats whose detention at Zobarah was reported in his telegram of the 2; th July. Pro.

In reporting the part played by Jasim in these disturbances, (letter No. 110, dated 19th October 1895) the Political Resident (Colonel Wilson) Action against Sheikh jasim, 1895. expressed the opinion that he had been the No. 196 of ditto. ^ ehief instigator of them, and that he had rendered himself liable to exemplary punishment. The Government of India therefore decided that Jasim should be compelled to pay a fine of Rs. 30,000, and Government of India letter No. 68 -E., dated loth if he failed to pay this fine, his boats January 1896, No. 200 of Secret E., March 1896, should be destroyed Nos. 193-201.

One important test of our protectorate over Bahrein is whether we protect its subjects in foreign territory, since the right of a subject of a protected state to such protection from the protecting power, is an admitted doctrine of International law. This question has been put to the test in several instances as in Turkish territory, but the right of the British Government to protect the Bahreinese in their territory has not yet been recognized by the Ottoman Government. 329. (i) In October 1892 the Porte addressed a note to Sir F. C. Ford (British Ambassador at Constantinople) No. 214, of Secret e ., May 1893, Nos. 207 261. complaining that Her Majesty's Consul at Basrah had demanded the restitution of the taxes levied at Basrah on certain boatmen, natives of Bahrein, on the plea that the Bahrein islands were under British protection. The Porte con tended that the inhabitants of Bahrein had no right to the protection of Her Majesty. 330. In reply to this communication, Sir F. C. Ford, addressed the follow- VT Q ins: no/e uarbale to the Porte on 11 th N g . 228. A •! n 1 • • r tt April 1892 under instructions of Her Majesty's Government:— 'Her Majesty's Embassy regrets that it is not possible to comply with the requests of the Sublime Porte in the matter. It will be in the recollection of the Imperial Government that on 10th December 1871 Server Pasha, then Minister for Foreign Attairs, formally assured Count Pisani, Dragoman of Her Majesty's Embassy, that the Sublime Porte entertained not the least intention to attack or obtain any supremacy over the independent tribes on the Coast of the Persian Gulf. Bahrein being now under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen of England, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has instructed the Embassy to inform the Imperial Government that no interference by the Ottoman authorities with natives of that Island can be admitted!* 331. On January 18th 1893 the British Consul at Basrah received a depu- 0 , t - , , o vt tation of Bahreinese subjects resident in Secret E.. July 1893, Nos. 290-293, . . . J . . . that place, requesting to be taken under British protection. The deputation was informed by the Consul that ''ifany person claiming to be a subject of Esau-bin AH produces a letter from the Sheikh to this effect and asks that protection may be extended to him, such protection will be given but not otherwise.' 332. The Political Resident in Bushire accordingly informed the Residency Agent, Bahrein, (letter No. 408, dated 24th November 1893) that subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein wishing to go to Basrah for trade or as Nakhodas or boatmen, under British protection should be provided with documents from the Sheikh certifying them to be his subjects. 333. The Porte on 4th April 1893 addressed a note verbale to the British £ t _ c T , o XT Ambassador calling attention to certain No. 106 of Secret E., July 1893, Nos. 97-112. . . , 0 i.i ^ , i communications, observed that it was stated therein that Her Majesty's Government had no right to interfere in the affairs of Bahrein. The Porte therefore protested against the proceedings of the British Consul at Basrah in claiming to protect Bahreinese subjects. The following note verhale was given in reply to the Porte. Note Verbale No. 55, dated gth May iSgj. Her Majesty's Embassy has had the honor to receive the note No. 34, which the No. .88, Of Sect E., Ma, .8™, Nos. .86-248. Sublime Porte was good enough to address to it on the 4th April, relative to the claim of the natives of Bahrein to British protection in the Ottoman dominions. Her Majesty's Embassy [Cg43FD] s90 desires in reply to rrake the following observations On the statement preferred in the abovementioned note from the Sublime Porte :— In the year 1851, Sir G. Canning, at the time Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constanti nople, was instructed by Lord Palmerston to stats to the Ottoman Government that Her Majesty's Government could not acknowledge or acquiesce in any arrangement with a view to placing the island of Bahrein under the sovereignty or protection of the Porte, seeing that the Government of India had Treaty relations with Bahrein as an independent State &amp; since 1820, and that Her Majesty's Government must object to any arrangement which would transfer it to the dominion or protectorship of any other Power. On 14th February 1870 Mr. Barron, then Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Cons tantinople, explained to the Sublime Porte, in accordance with instructions which he had received from Lord Clarendon, that Her Majesty's Government would not recoo -nise the claim of the Ottoman Government to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and referred to the despatch addressed by Lord Palmerston to Sir G. Canning, of which the substance has been given above. Mr. Barron also handed to Ali Pasha an extract from a memorandum on the subiect which had been transmitted from the Foreign Office in London, and which His HiVhness accepted without remark. At an interview on 25th April 1871 between Mr. Pisani Chief Dragoman to the British Ambassador, and the Grand Vizier, Ali Pasha, in reference to the contemplated Ottoman expedition to Nejd, Ali Pasha said that the British Ambassador might give the most positive assurance to Her Majesty's Government that the Sublime roite entertained no intention whatever of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein. r Sublime Porte in its present note under acknowledgment observes that Lord Granville in a note to Musurus Pasha, dated 8lh August 1872 stated that Her Maiestv's Government had no right to interfere in the affairs of the Persian Gulf. A perusal of the said note to Musurus Pasha, a copy of which Her Majesty's Embassv has the honor to endose, will show that Lord Granville stated that it was not the wish of Her Majesty s Government to interfere, &amp;c. Hts Lordship did not say that they had not the right to do so. It is evident that Lord Granville's statement was not intended to admitany claim on the part of Turkey to the island. The Sublime Porte has also cited a note hT. fV.hn f 7 1° Musurus ^ asha ' dat f d Mth April 1874.

Political Resident in the Turkish Arabia, that the 1 urkish authori ties at Basrah had treated a vessel belonging to a subject of the Sheikh of Bahrein, as though subject to the same local rules as to the levy of port dues as a Turkish vessel and had exacted fees accordingly from him. It was proposed that the lurkish authorities should be asked to refund the.fees exacted. Colonel Mockler decided that no further action should be taken and that for the future the British Consul at Basrah was advised to satisfy himself in the first instance that the person claiming protection on the ground of being a Bahreinese subject is really such and that for this purpose he should warn the Bahreinese to provide themselves with a passport or letter of recommendation from their Sheikh, bearing date immediately prior to their starting from Bahrein for Basrah. 336. A communication on the subject was made by the Consul at Basrah Secret E., January .895, Nos. 52-58. f 0 A the the Political Resident at Bushire in August 1904, and the Residency Agent in Bahrein was instructed to remind the Sheikh of the necessity for his subjects providing themselves with documents from him certifying them to be such subjects in order to satisfy the British Consul of their nationality should they need to appeal to him. It was also pointed out that the same papers would be available for production before the British Vice Consul at Mohammerah. 337. The question of the British right of intervention on behalf of the Bahreinese was raised again early in De- e N o^o-h . 3 ' 395 * 40J, arid SeCret camber 1895, when a piracy was commit ted against one of them on the Shat-ul- Arab. The facts briefly are these. 338. On the night of the 1st December, 1895 a Bhareinese subject was Secret E, January .897, a passenger in a Koweit boat on the Shat- ul-Arab. At a place about 10 miles below the port of Basrah the boat was boarded by men who stated they were employees of the Rigie Department and the crew and passengers were compelled to give up all their valuables. The Bahreinese passanger was robbed of a large sum of money. He subsequently appealed to our Consul at Basrah. 'J he Consul addressed the Turkish Government on the subject, but received a reply that his action in doing so was improper, as the Turkish Government did not recognize the claim of British Consular authorities to intervene on behalf of the Bahreinese. Our Consul at Basrah thereupon telegraphed to the Embassy at Constantinople reporting this, and in consequence Sir Philip Currie addressed a note verbale to Porte stating:— u Her Majesty's Embassy have received a telegram from Her Majesty's Consul at No. 40I) of Secret E., May 1896, Nos. 399-403. Bas.ah, stating that a subject of the Sheikh » • j i.■ 1 i. 1 , ... of Bahl ' ei n; whose property had been plundered by pira.es while he was on board a sailing vessel in the Saht-ul-Arab had appealed to him for assistance. Captain White accordingly addressed the Vali on the subject, but His Excellency intimated that his action in so doing was improper, and that according to his instructions the Turkish Government does not recognise the claim of British Consular authorities to intervene on behalf of Bahreinese. Her Majesty s Embassy have the honor to refer to their Note Verbale No. 84 of the 12 . l8 95&gt; to numerous other written and verbal communications made on this matter, and they would remind the Sublime Porte that, as the Chief of Bahrein is under the protection of the Queen of England, it is quite inadmissible that the natives of Bahrein should, when on Ottoman territory, be treated as Turkish subjects. 1 hey have accordingly to request that immediate instruction be sent to the Vali of Basrah to recognise the right of Her Majesty's Consul to intervene in cases in which natives of Bahrein are concerned.' . 339- Her Majesty's Government expressed their approval of this communi cation. 340. Another note was addressed by Sir P. Currie to the Porte on 4th April No, 68, of Secret e., January 1897, n03.50-74. j 896, giving the details of the piracy. But , . Turkish Government took no action on our complaint.92 34i. The Government of India expressed their full concurrence with the attitude of Her Majesty's Government in 0 ' /4 ' , * ' declining the Turkish claims over Bahrein and in insisting on the right of British Consular Officers to intervene, in Ottoman territory, on behalf of subjects of the Bahrein chief. (Despatch No. 200, dated 30th December 1896.) J-lil r93 CHAPTER XXXVI. Claim of Bahreinese for British protection in Persia, 1899. 34a. The question of the right of the Bahrienese to British protection in Secret e., September 1899, Nos. i 88 i - i 83. Persia, was rajSGd by the French Minister , , . . . ' at Tehran in 1899 this wise. A French protege of Persian nationality prosecuted, unjustly it was believed, a claim against the^ widow of a Bahrein subject who had long enjoyed the protection of the British Residency and who herself was the daughter of an emancipated slave. The case was referred to the British Legation in consequence cf certain charges of misconduct, which the French Consul had made against the Residency Agent at Lingah, rendering it impossible for the British Resident at Bushire to dispose of it without such reference. 343- The following telegrams were then exchanged between Sir M. Durand and Colonel Meade Telegram, dated the 19th July 1899. From— S ir H. M. D urand, K.C .S .I., Tehran, To—The Resident, Bushire. No 81. French Minister asks me whether you protect natives of Bahrein residing in ports of the Persian Gulf^: are such persons within our Indian protectorate, and therefore subject to our Consular jurisdiction? Please give me material for exact reph'. The question is, no doubt, asked with reference to Lingah case. Telegram, dated the 29th July 1899. From— L ibutenant- C olonel M. J. M eade (Resident), Bushire, To—Her Majesty 's Minister, Tehran. No. 109. Your Excellency's telegram No. 81. In December 1893 Her Majesty 's becretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constanti nople that the Chief of Bahrein was under British protection, which would also be extended to his subjects whenever there may be occasion for it. In September 1894 the order to extend protection was rep-ated by India Office to Government of India. The Sheikh has been precluded by Treaty since 1880 from having political relations with any other foreign power than the British. 34o* Colonel Meade was told by the Government of India that his answer was correct. C 934 FD BB94 CHAPTER XXXVII. Visit of Belgian Director of Persian customs to the Chief of Bahrein. Status of the Chief, 1901. No. 377 of Secret e ., October 1901, Nos. 368. 346. The Political Resident telegraphed 386 - on the 2nd September 1891: — ' Gaskin reports that Persian Government steamer with Belgian Director, Customs, visited Bahrein, 3rst August. Belgian called on Sheikh and informed him that he had been deputed by the Shah to obtain Sheikh's concent to place two officials in Bahrein for the purpose of examining the seals placed on the cargoes in hatches of steamers at the last Persian port and reseal them when the steamers leave for Bushire. Belgian then called on Gaskin and told him that arrangements for sealing hatches had been made with the approval of the foreign representatives at Teheran, and if Sheikh refuses Shah's request, ships calling at Bahrein will be repelled from Persian ports. He asked Gaskin about status of Chief of Bahrein and what he would advise Sheikh if latter referred matter to him. Gaskin replied that, as he had not heard from me on the subject, he could express no opinion without reference. Chief informed Belgian that he would reply to his communication later on through me. I have informed Gaskin that there is no need tor the Chief to send any reply to Belgian, and that Persian officials should not be allowed at Bahrein. I suppose, if you approve, to ask Minister to protest strongly against communication made by Belgian direct to Sheikh. Status of Bahrein is well known and any communications which the Persian Government may have to make should be made through Minister. Question of sealing cargo holds is also of importance as affect- ing British interests, and we must claim to be consulted before new arrangement is introduced. Great secrecy was observed with regard to the visit of Persians at the begin ning to Bahrein.' 347. The Political Resident's proposal to move the Minister at Teheran h 0 . o 7 8 was approved by the Government of India. No, 380. 34 8 - Sir Arthur Hardinge telegraphed to Simla on 6th September :— ' I have delivered strong protest to Grand Vizier against visit reported by Resident Bushire, of Belgian Customs official to Bahrein for the purpose of inducing Sheikh to accept Persian Customs House and conclude certain commercial arrangements. His Highness and Monsieur Naus expressed astonishment at visit, of which they declared they knew nothing. They are telegraphing for explanations to Bushire and Grand Vizier has expressed his regret at incident, which however he still hopes may prove to have been inaccurately reported.'95 CHAPTER XXXVIII. Refusal to admit the right of the Turkish Government on Consular officers in Bahrein being provided with an Ottoman Exequatur, 1898, 349. In January 1898, the Porte called the attention of Sir P. Currie to a Secret e.. may 1898, Nos. 1.6. re P ort ^ reached it of the appoint ment of a British Vice-Consul at Bahrein and requested that Her Majesty's Government will apply to the Porte for his Exequatur. The reply which it was decided by Her Majesty's Government to give to the Porte was that they cannot admit the right of the Porte to insist on consular officers, Bahrein, being provided with an Ottoman Exequatur. 350. As a matter of fact no such Consular Officer had been appointed at the time.96 CHAPTER XXXIX. Jurisdiction in regard to disputes between subjects of the Chief of Bahrein and foreigners, 1900—1901. 351. The above question was raised in view of a project of a German Mr. i R. Wankhaus to open a business at Bahrein. Secret e ., May igo., Nos. 29 -31. The fo i lowing i etter 0 f Political Resident, Bushire, No. 295, dated 24th December 1900, explains the point :— ' I have the honour to report that I have been informed by the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein that Mr. R. Wankhaus, a member of a German firm of Hamburg, who visited Bahrein recently, gave him to understand that it was his intention to open a branch of his business at Bahrein. Mr. Wankhaus has been doing business in Lingah for some years, and I forward, for the information of the Government of India, a memorandum regarding him, prepared by my First Assistant, and recently forwarded to the General Superintendent, Thagi and Dakaiti Department. The question has now to be considered as to what course the Assistant Political Agent should pursue with reference to mercantile and other cases which may arise bet ween subjects of the Chief of Bahrein and Mr. Wankhaus or his Agent at Bahrein. The Chief of Bahrein is precluded, by the agreement entered into by him with the British Government in 1880,-from granting permission for the establishment by any other Govern ment than the British of diplomatic or consular agencies in Bahrein, and, this being so, it seems to me that the correct course to pursue, with regard to the cases alluded to above, will be for the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Bahrein Chief, The matter is of considerable importance, and I shall be glad to learn if my view is approved by the Government of India.' 352. The memorandum referred to is quoted below :— ' It appears that Mr. Robert Wankhaus is a member of the Hamburg firm of Peins and Sturken, and was employed by them for some years in establishing agencies in Madagascar. When the French took over the island, the firm began to find restrictions on trade so irksome that they contemplated giving it up and sent Mr. Wankhaus to the Gulf to see if there was an opening for trade there. Mr. Wankhaus came to the Gulf in 1897, and since then has lived mostly at Lingah ; he was joined in 1898 by another German named Franke, who had been connected with several unsuccessful commercial enterprises at Bushire and Shiraz. Their business has been mostly in oyster shells which they export to Hamburg. Mr. Franke left for Germany in July 1898, and Mr. Wankhaus visited Bahrein in September and stayed there about a month. From several conversations with him, Mr. Gaskhin, the Assistant Political Agent, was of opinion that he did not meddle with politics, but since then information has been received that he went over to the Oman Coast, and by a trick got hold of copies of the British treaties with some of the Trucial Chiefs. This is not of importance, as the treaties are not secret, but it looks as if Mr. Wankhaus was busying himself in getting information for the German Government; and our A^ent at Lingah reports that he corresponds with the German Legation at Teheran.' 353- The Government of India replied to the Resident (Letter No. VoS-E.A., dated 4th May 1901)— ' You suggest that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between sub- No. 30. jects of the Bahrein Chief and Mr. Wankhaus Arronf u u • i. . j . . or his Agent at Bahrein, the Assistant Political Rrinl h' ♦ I , nstr '. cte&lt;i ? e alw.th such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Bahrein Chief.

At the same time we desire to add that the position is not in our opinion altogether satisfactory, nor it is one which \s likely to be permanent. In proportion as to the subjects of foreign powers settled in Bahrein for purposes of trade, so will the cases raise the question ot the nature and extent o the British protectorate become more frequent and perhaps troublesome • and it is for e consideration whether some steps should not be taken at an early date to place our position in Bahrein upon a more assured and definite footing. 2.

(i) Establishment of the American Arabian Mission in Bahrein. (2) Complaints against the proceedings of Mr. Zwemer. (3) Question as to allotment of plot of ground for their Mission house and hospital, etc., in the face of the agreement of 1892. 1899—1901. 356. In February 1899, Government of India received from Leiutenant- Estemai b , inarch 1899, N03.313-214, and Nos. Colonel Meade an application which had 240 ' 357 ' been made to him by Mr. Zwemer of the American Arabian Mission for assistance in obtaining a building site at Bahrein. Colonel Meade expressed the opinion that the presence of missionaries at Bahrein was a source of danger. Government of India instructed Colonel Meade to inform Mr. Zwemer that he could give him no assistance for the reason that it is the settled policy of the British Government to interfere in nowise with religious customs and beliefs. Colonel Meade was also directed to make it clear to the Sheikh that the attitude of the British Government was one of absolute neutrality } and that Colonel Meade himself had no wish to influence in any way the Sheikh's decision on Mr. Zwemer's application. Be fore these instructions reached him, Colonel Meade visited Bahrein ; Mr. Zwemer agreed to make no further attempt to purchase land, and, Colonel Meade hoped that matters would thereafter run smoothly, and advised him however about the acquisition of a house for his Mission. 357. In a letter No. 76, dated the 29th May 1899, the Political Resident Secret E., July 1899, Nos. 249-254. ^ the Persian Gulf forwarded, with remarks, translations of papers on the subject of complaints referred by the Sheikh and the residents of Bahrein against Mr Zwemer and suggested that in consequence of fresh complaints made against his Scripture readers in ridiculing and abusing Mahomet, it might be advisable that he and his comrades should leave Bahrein, as it was not improbable that they might be subjected to personal violence. 358. The facts of the case were embodied in a draft despatch to the Secretary of State which was submitted to, and met with, His Excellencv's approval. Lord Curzon noted, 14th June 1899:— } t •^ B i U - t i lt 18 a P 1 ^, that before our instructions reached him Colonel MesHe chnnM {vide his letter of loth March) have given any advice to the Missionary about the acquisi 0f a h0USe f0r hlS m,sslon - Thl3 was Practically an encouragement to the padre to remain. 359. In the Despatch (No. 118, dated 22nd June iSon) after statins th P facts as regards the proposed acquisition of site for house for the AmS-ican Mission, it was observed :— American ' As fresh complaints have now been made, we agree with Leiufemnf- m j that it is undesirable for Mr. Zwemer and his comrades to remain in R^ , ad - e is not improbable that they might be subjected to personal vinlei re ^ ,,rein ' ' ll ' e lt glad if Her Majesty's Gove/nmeft could tie suclT^afw^S^ Mr.tve'lr-: 360. In forwarding copy of this despatch to the Foreign offl^ ^ t j- Office in its letter, dated 28th July 1899, observed:— Office, the India ' Lord Salisbury is aware that the Chief of Bahrein U u 1.1., is bound by an engagement Secret E., February igoo, Nos. ng -iai. dated the 22nd December 1880, to abstatn from than the British, and to refuse permissio^ toTnToTher State 0ther Agencies in the island.

Proceeding of Mr. causing uneasiness. It is not explained w hether his Dre a cMn 0 t - am,1 ; a - religion and residence or in the public streets and leads to any breach 0?% 'l ,n ' he mission Zwemer s re pl y to the charges is not given, but i/is stated IrCol^f ^Tade has99 been instructed to inform that gentleman that he can give him no assistance and to explain to the Sheikh that Colonel Meade has no wish to influence the decision of the Sheikh. In these circumstances Lord George Hamilton is disposed to agree with the conclu sion of the Government of India that it is undesirable for Mr. Zwemer and his com panions to remain at Bahrein against the wishes of the Sheikh. I am to suggest therefore, that, if the Marquess of Salisbury concurs in this view, the facts of the case as stated in these papers, might be communicated to the Embassy of the United States of America in London, with an intimation that Her Majesty's Government will have very great difficulty in interfering to maintain Mr. Zwemer's residence in the island, if it be clearly ascertained that the Chief of Bahrein desires to exercise his authority by requiring him to withdraw.' 361. The Foreign Office appears then to have made the communication proposed to the United States Embassy, and in reply received a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Board of the American Missions, explaining the principles on which the organization is guided in carrying on its work and also stating that they had enjoined upon Mr. Zwemer the duty of exercising the utmost caution compatible with the performance of his mission. The Secretray of Stats in forwarding copy of this correspondence (Despatch No. 1 Secret, dated 5th January 1900), instructed us that if the political authorities in the Gulf should have reason to think that the gentleman referred to was deviating from his instructions, the precise facts of the case might be duly reported. • 362. In April 1901, Mr. Zwemer asked Colonel Kemball whether there were m . 1 a a 4. XT f o any clauses or provisions in the treaties External A., August 1901. Nos, 55-58. , ■&gt; „ . r t v , , between the Government of India and the Chief of Bahrein, which would forbid his selling property or allowing property on the islands to be sold to the American Mission for hospital purposes. Colonel Kemball replied that he was not aware of any such clauses or pro visions. 36'?. This reply, Lord Curzon thought, was quite incompatible with the provisions of the agreement of 1892, and there was reason for suspecting that Colonel Kemball was unaware of this agreement. The following letter (No. 1077-E.A., dated 3rd July 1901), was therefore written to Colonel Kemball:— t( Under the agreement of 1892, the Sheikh of Bahrein bound himself not to ' cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of his territory, save to the British Government,' and it is not understood why, in your letter of the nth May iqoi, you informed Mr. Zwemer that you were not aware of any treaty which precludes the Sheikh from selling property or allowing property on the islands to be sold to the Arabian Mission. Such a statement is clearly incorrect. The Government of India have no objection to the sale to the Mission of a site for a house or a hospital if the Sheikh is willing to allow it, but it is as well to give publicly to the fact that, under the terms of the above agreement, the Sheikh is pro hibited from disposing of any part of his territory to foreigners, without the express consent of the British Government. Unless you are aware that Mr, Zwemer already realises the position, I am to request that a suitable communication may be made to him.' 364. On this point Lord George Hamilton in writing to the Foreign Office ^ ^ u vt ^ o (Letter, 1st August 1901), expressed, a Secret E., October 1901, Nos. 156-158. \ 1.1,1 ■ .1 r ^ , doubt whether, in the case of a sale of ordinary private ownership pure and simple to a private party, and there being no suspicion that any thing of a nature of sovereign or administrative rights is being parted with or delegated, the objection formally raised by the Government of India under the terms of the agreement could be sustained. The Marquess of Lansdowne expressed the opinion that ' as a matter of principle it is desirable that such agreements should be held to cover all cases where there is any suspicion of the transfer oj sovereignty or administrative rights. In the case under question, where no such suspicion existed, it was in Lord Lands- downe's opinion neither necessary nor desirable to invoke publicly the terms of the agreement with the Sheihk as debarring him from granting a site for a mission to a citizen of the United States. 365. A copy of this correspondence was forwarded to the Political Resident with instructions to be guided by the principle laid down by Lord Lansdowne in any similar case which might occur in future.I IOO CHAPTER XLI. (1) Question as to allowing Mr. Wonckaus, a German trader at Bahrien, to purchase a house there and Messrs. Hotz and Co. of Bushire to open a business there in the near future. (2) Question of Jurisdiction over foreigners. 1902-03. 366. We had to face again the question of the probable acquisition of house property by foreigners, and the question of the jurisdiction to which they would be subject. 367. The perusal of the following correspondence on the matter will make the point and our views clear:— No. 175, dated Bushire, the 13th December 1902 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. ' I have the honour to forward copy of a letter No. 246, dated the 30th November 1902, from the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to my address on the subject of the acquisition of house property at Bahrein by foreigners! It will be seen that Mr. Gaskin considers it probable that Mr. Wonckaus the* German trader now at Bahrein, may wish to purchase the house which he' has now taken on a five years' lease from its Bahrein! owner; and he also brings to notice the fact that the firm of Messrs. Hotz &amp; Co. of Bushire, now under Russian protection, probably intend to open a business at Bahrein in the near future. 2. In the confidential letter No. 1685-E.A., dated 1st October 1901, from the Under-Secretary to the Government of India to my address dealing with the^ subject of the acquisition by the Arabian Mission of property at Bahrein, it was* laid down that in any similar case which may occur in the future, I was to be guided by the principle, that in cases where no suspicion exists of the transfer of sovereignty or administrative rights, it is neither necessary nor desirable to invoke publicly the Agreement of 1892, whereby the Chief of Bahrein is precluded from ceding, selling, mortgaging or otherwise giving for occupation, any part of his territory save to the British Government. No reasonable objection can, I presume, be taken by us to Germans or other foreigners hiring premises at Bahrein for the purposes of legitimate business; but we cannot view with equanimity the establishment of direct dealings between foreign Consular officers and the Chief of Bahrein. I am of opinion, therefore, that the opportunity maybe taken of informing * the Chief that, although the Government of India might have no objection lo a private trader of a foreign nation acquiring premises in Bahrein for purposes of legitimate trade, such acquisition will not give the Consul of that foreigner's nation the right to enter into direct relations with the Chief; and that should a foreign Consul seek to correspond directly with the Chief, we expect the Chief to decline to enter into such correspondence and to refer the Foreign Consul to the British authorities. • s As . r , e S ar p S :he f ; rm of Messrs. Hotz &amp; Co.. this firm may be under Russian pro ection in Persia, but this fact cannot give them the right to enjoy Russian protection in Bahrein which is outside Persia No. 246, dated Bahrein, the 30th November 1902 (Confidential). From— J. C. G askin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein T0 ~ L fnTe N pe N r T ;ia n 0 G 0 u« EL C ' A ' KEMBALL ' 0ffic ' ati ^ PoU ^ Resident build?™' h™'' t0 'P ort k th f t &gt; J'ly last, Mr. Wonckaus leased a building Irom Ha]! Hussem Kassab for a term of five y ears at a rent of • Vidi paragraphs 364-65, a nit.IOI Rs. ioo per annum, paying the rent of four years in advance, and that for the fifth year was retained for adding a kitchen and servants' quarters and keeping the premises in repairs. Mr. Wonckaus has informed me that he has a clause in the contract to the effect that, in the event of the landlord desiring to dispose of the house at the termination of the lease, he has the option of purchasing it at the rate offered, should the landlord be agreeable to sell it for that figure. The house in question contains numerous godowns and an upper storey, and occupies the best site in Bahrein for trade purposes, especially the shell trade, and it is said to have cost over Rs. 22,000; and if Mr. Wonckaus's business transactions prove successful, there is reason to believe that he will try to acquire the property. I understood from him that, in the event of his buying property in Bahrein, such property would come under the extra-territorial rights usually exercised by his Government in the dominions of Muhammadan rulers. I told Mr. Wonckaus that the Chief of Bahrein has a treaty with the British Government to the effect that he is not to sell land to foreigners with out the consent of the British Government, and when permission is given, it is understood that such lands or property shall remain under the local law. He referred to the fact of Persian and Turkish subjects acquiring land without a reference being made to the British Government regarding which I informed him that such persons being amenable to Muhammadan law in their own country are bound to come under the same law in Bahrein by which immov able property is governed. Mr. V/onckaus, I believe, is on his way to Bushire, and, possibly, he may discuss the question with the German Consul at that place, and the latter may speak to you on the subject. Mr. S. Dods, an Assistant in Messrs. Hotz &amp; Co., Bushire, who enjoy Russian protection, informed me on the occasion of his recent visit to Bahrein that his firm will probably start business here in the first quarter of the new year, when there will be two foreign firms established here. Government* of India, as you are aware, have already directed that our good offices shall be extended to European traders and their employes, but this appears to be insufficient to prevent foreign Consuls from interfering on behalf of the subjects of their respective Governments, and in view of the. desire of the Russian Government to obtain a footing in the Persian Gulf and their policy of harming our prestige wherever they can, it is possible that that Government may make the presence of this firm an excuse for interference in Bahrein, and it seems to me desirable that, in order to check any friction likely to arise in future, some definite policy ought to be adopted as regards the question of the relations of the subjects of European powers with the Chief of Bahrein'. No, 1156-E., dated Simla, the 2nd June 1903. From—The Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, To —Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, CLE., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 369. ' I am directed to reply to your letter No. 1 75, dated the 13th December 1902, regarding the probable intention of Mr. Wonckaus, a German trader, to purchase certain premises in Bahrein, which he now holds on a temporary lease. f 2. The Government of India agree with you that as this is a case of private ownership, pure and simple, by a private party, there is no objection to Mr. Wonckaus purchasing the property, should he so desire. In view, however, of the belief which Mr. Wonckaus is reported to hold, that, in the event of his acquiring the property, it will not be amenable to local law, but will be subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consular or other representative of a foreign nation the right to ♦ Vide paragraph 353 ante. [C934FD] DD102 enter into direct relations with the Chief, and that should any such official address the Chief, he should be referred to the British authorities. The position should also be clearly explained to Mr. Wonckaus. 3, I am to request that in the event of Messrs. Hotz &amp; Co. preparing to establish a branch of their business at Bahrein, the fact may be reported '.103 CHAPTER XLII. (1) Proposed appointment of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to be a Notary Public for the islands of Bahrein. (2) Question of granting Consular powers. 1902. 370. On both these matters a perusal of the Important correspondence below is needed :— No. 7, dated Bushire, the 16th January 1902^ From — L ieutenant -C olonel C. A. K emball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—H. S. B arnes, Esq., C.S.I., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of India ; Foreign Department. 371. The Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein reports that during the year 1901 he has been requested by masters of merchant vessels to issue bills of health on four occasions and also to note five Marine protests : he has also been applied to for one passport and also to legalize nineteen signatures on behalf of British Indian subjects. He reports that the fees leviable for the service thus rendered would have amounted to ^'8 -17 -6 according to the scale of Consular fees, had he possessed authority to levy such fees. 2. So far as the issue of bills of health, noting of Marine protests, etc., are concerned, such acts can only be performed by officers possessing Consular rank, which, the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein does not possess, and with which in view of the political status of Bahrein it will probably be incon venient to invest him. I do not, however, anticipate that much inconvenience will be experienced on this account, as the number of direct merchant vessels calling at Bahrein is not large. The mail steamers and most of the other mer chant vessels which call at Bahrein also visit Bushire, where application can be made for the performance of duties required under the Merchant Shipping Act. It will be better therefore, I think, that the Assistant Political Agent should in future inform masters of merchant vessels, who make applications to him, that he has no authority to perform duties of a Consular nature. 3. With regard to duties of a notarial nature such as the legalisation of signatures, execution of powers of attorney, and other acts which might be required of a Notary Public, I think that it may be advisable that the Assistant Political Agent should be appointed by notification in the Gazette of India under the Negotiable Instruments Act, XXVI of 1881, to be a Notary Public for the Islands of Bahrein, and authorised at the same time to levy fees to be credited to the Government of India, in accordance with the scale of fees levied under the provisions of the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council, 4. With regard to the issue of passports I propose to instruct the Assistant Political Agent to forward any applications which he may receive to me for disposal. No. 914-A., dated Simla, the 6th May 1902. From—J. B. W ood, Esq., I .C .S., Under Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, jo L ieutenant -C olonel C. A. K emball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, ^72. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 7, dated the 16th January 1902, requesting that the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein may be appointed to be a Notary Public for the islands of Bahrein. 3. I am to point out that the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1 881 (XXVI of 188 0 under which you propose to appoint Mr. Gaskin to be a Notary Public has not been applied to Bahrein, and that there is not at present any authorised procedure by which it can be brought into general operation there. Moreover104 the appointment of Mr. Gaskin to be a Notary Public under the Act would only constitute him a Notary Public for the purposes of that specific enactment, and would not authorise him, as you apparently suppose, to do such other acts as might be required of a Notary Public. Special provision has been made by the Commissioners for Oaths Act, 1889 (5 2 Vict., c. 10), section 6, for the perfor mance of Notarial acts in foreign countries by diplomatic and Consular officers of His Majesty, and, though the law both in England and in India recognises certain acts of Public Notaries appointed by foreign authority, it is inexpedient to rely upon such authority for the appointment of a diplomatic officer of a class not specified in the statute. 3. In the circumstances above explained, it is a matter for consideration whether the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein should not be invested with Consular powers which would enable him to perform the functions of a Notary Public by virtue of his office: and, if you think that there is sufficient justification for the grant of such powers, the Government of India will be prepared to con sider any proposal which you may make to this effect. 4. The Government of India are aware that the peculiar status of Bahrein may possibly render the investment of Mr. Gaskin with Consular powers a somewhat anomalous proceeding, but they are disposed to think that no practical difficulty need be apprehended from the step, and that there may be advantages in providing for the exercise of power and jurisdiction over His Majesty's Euro pean subjects and others in Bahrein and on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf by an order m Council similar to that which has been framed for Maskat and for the Persian Coasts and Islands, The Governor-General in Council will therefore, be glad to be furnished with your opinion on this proposal, together with any aternative suggestions which you may have to offer.

K emball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 373. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No QI4 -E A dated 6th May, in which, after pointing out the impracticability of the proposal submitted by me for the investment of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein with certain notarial poweis, you say that it is a matter for consideration whether the Assistant Political Agent should not be invested with Consular powers which would enable him to perform the functions of a Notary Public by virtue of his 2. In my opinion, considering the requirements of Bahrein and the nature of our representation there, it is not necessary nor advisable that the Assistant Political Agent should have more than Vice-Consular rank, which cou'd as in the case of the Vice-Consul at Bushire, be conferred on him bv warrant'of the Consu'-General at Bushire, At present, however, the Consular jurisdiction of the Resident at Bushire does not extend beyond the Persian side of the Gulf and the islands appertaining thereto, and although the question of Consular jurisdiction for Bahrein and the Arabian Coasts of the Gulf was considered at ihe time when the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council was drafted— vide paragraph 5 of the despatch No. no-External, dated 22nd Julv 1887 from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India-it is not -A T.7 r u 1 at that 'T t J he i ' SUe 0f a se P arate Order in Council for that side of the Gulf was contemplated. The simplest solution of the question would be to extend the Resident's Consular jurisdiction in the required direc' tion without the issue of a separate Order in Council. He could then issue a warrant appointing Mr Gaskin to be Vice-Consul at Bahrein. Mr Gaskin would thus be enabled by virtue of his office to perform the functions of a Notary Public, and the powers conferred upon him would, for all the present practical requirements of Bahrein, be ample. If however a separate OrdeJ jn Council is required, it should, I think, be framed with a view to extend the Resident s Consular jurisdiction and not to create a separate and independent Consular appointment as at Muscat. penaeni10 5 3. At the same time, I am inclined to doubt whether the requirements of the case justify the issue of a separate Order in Council to provide for Consular jurisdiction at Bahrein and the other places in the Gulf not already provided for by Orders in Council. The Assistant Political Agent is already invested with magisterial powers in criminal cases over British Indian subjects, and there are at present no European British subjects at Bahrein. The want, therefore, of Consular jurisdiction has not hitherto been felt to any appreciably extent, and the object of my letter No. 7, dated 16th January, was merely to suggest that notarial powers should be conferred upon the Assistant Political Agent so as to enable him to perform certain notarial functions and levy fees for so doing. As a matter of fact. Courts in India are not, I think, likely to dispute the validity of the Assistant Political Agent's attestation of documents and the question of the levy of fees is not of much importance. If, therefore, a separate Order in Council is required to invest the Assistant Political Agent with Consular rank, I am disposed to think that there is at present no sufficient justification for the measure. 4. In connection with the extension of Consular jurisdiction to Bahrein, it is, I think, necessary to bear in mind that although we have an agreement with the Chief of Bahrein whereby Foreign Consuluc Agencies cannot be established in Bahrein without the consent of the British Government, it may perhaps be inconvenient to maintain this position in the event of British Con sular jurisdiction being extended to Bahrein. The Gerrr\an Consul at Bushire informed me once in course of conversation that he considered his jurisdiction in the Gulf to extend wherever mine did, and I think he said that his instructions from his Government were to this effect. This point has not of course escaped the notice of the Government of India, but I mention it so as to make my present report as complete as possible. 374. The following notes were recorded upon this We suggested the passing of an Order in Council for Bahrein and the southern shores of There *re other reasons suggested in Mr. Ed- the Gulf, and the investment of Mr. Gaskin with ward 's note of 10th February igoi, paragraph 7 Consular powers, mainly because Colonel Kem- (Secret E., May 1901, Nos. 29 31).

Colonel J. B.Wood . Kemball's present letter indicates that the neces sity is more imaginary than real, and he thinks that there is at present no sufficient justifica tion for passing an Order in Council, which may indeed complicate the position in Bahrein by inducing other powers to claim Consular representation in the island. I think that we may accept Colonel Kemball's view and that the question need not be further pursued at present. Legislative Department might see for any remarks. J. B, W ood,— 20-8-02. H.

We have had to notice the frequent piracies that occurred in 1878-80 and the action taken by us to sup press them {vide Chapter XXII). In the year* 1887, no fewer than seven serious piracies occurred between the months of July and October. There w-as a lull for ,10 years and then in 1899 four cases were reported. In 1900 there were five Secret e., February 1900, Nos. 68-69. more cases. In 1901 there appears to have Secret e., November 1900, Nos. 61-69. been complete immunity. In 1902 we have the instances detailed in Colonel Kemball's letter No. 28-S. A., dated the 13th September 1902. Four distinct acts of piracy were committed by one gang. 376. The details of the several piracies committed in 1899 and 1900 are as follows :— 377. In February 1899 a Persian boat was plundered off Abu Zaluf on the Katar coast. It was subsequently reported, however, that it w^as doubtful Secret e., february 1900, No. 68. whether this was genuine case of piracv. Secret e., April 1901, No. 87. 378.

None of the property belonging to the Bahrein owners appears to have been r estared. 386. In 1902 there was recrudescence of piracies in the vicinity of Katar 0 and Bahrein, committed by a party of the Secret E., January 1904, 1 OS. II 139- j ^ a jj r un( J er leadership of the notorious Ahmed -bin-Selman. In July 1903 they took a boat at Senalis, with which they crossed to the island of Um Nasan, and on 4th August captured a Bahrein dhow of 28 tons burden, which was lying there to load lime for Bahrein, by means of which dhow, some ten days later they waylaid and robbed another Bahrein boat, off Thaein in the Katar peninsula, of property valued at I 5)400- 387. In his letter No. 167, dated 8th December 1902, Colonel Kemball reported that Ahmed-bin-Selman belonged to the A1 Khalifa branch of the Bahrein Sheikhs, and had been once a subject of Bahrein, but had long since turned an outlaw. He first settled on Katar, but had removed to Katif before the recent piracies were commit ted. In these circumstances the Chief of Katar could not be held responsible for these piracies. The Chief of Bahrein proposed that he should be permitted to employ an armed dhow in pursuit of the pirates. He believed that a small vessel like a dhow at his disposal could pursue the pirates' boats at a moment's notice and with great facility in the narrow channels between Katif, Katar Bahrein, and Colonel Kemball was inclined to think (paragraph last of his letter No 167, dated 8th December 1903) that the Chief might be given the per mission applied for on the following conditions :— (i) that the permission of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein be ■obtained in the first instance; (ii) that one of the Chief's sons or other responsible person be put in charge of the boat; (iii) that the operations of the boat be confined to the seas between a point north of Ras Tanura and eastward round the Katar peninsula towards the neighbourhood of Bida. 388. The Government of India then addressed the following letter to Sir C. Drury, Commanding His Majesty's Naval Forces, East Indies Station (No. 675-E., dated 16th April 1903) ' &lt;( Under the terms of the agreement which he executed in 1861, the Sheikh of Bahrein is bound to abstain from any act of aggression No ' I2 4- or retaliation at sea, and any departure from the principle of this agreement might be attended by undesirable risks. At the same time there would probably be considerable advantage in, making some special arrangement for the patrollin'- or policing of the waters in this neighbourhood; not only on account of the increased security which should result, but also from the point of view that earlier and more accurate information might, if suitable measures were adopted, be obtained as to the condition of affairs on the neighbouring mainland. In the circumstances, I am to invite any suggestions or advice which Your Excellency may be in position to otfer on the subject. The^alternatives which present themselves to the Government of India are :— (i) the maintenance at Bahrein of an armed dhow of the class that has, it is understood, been recently employed with good effect in checking piracy and the trade in arms in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea; or (ii) the maintenance by the Sheikh, at his own expense, of a dhow manned by his own subjects, but which would be commanded by a junior British officer lent from the Roval Navy or from the Royal Indian Marine, to en-ure that it be only employed for proper purposes.io8 If Your Excellency is able to propose any precise arrangements, I am to request that an estimate of the probable cost may, if possible, be furnished. On receipt of Your Excellency's reply, the Government of India propose to address His Majesty s secretary of State 289. His Excellency Sir C. Drury's reply was as follows (letter dated 26th April 1903) - 'In reply to your confidential letter No. 675-E. of the 16th April, be pleased to inform His Excellency the Viceroy in Council that I considsr that the agreement made with the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1861 to abstain from any act of aggression or retaliation by sea should still be adhered to, as, if it was cancelled, complications might easily arise. I would desire to point out that in my opinion the results achieved by the use of armed dhows in the Gulf of Aden have not been as great a success as is generally supposed, and it is a very demoralising service for officers and men. The best course appears to me to be that I should be informed every year when the pearl fishery is to begin and end, and I would then endeavour to arrange for a gun-boat to police those waters during the time the fishery was being carried out. If it is decided that an armed dhow is necessary, I am of opinion that she should be commanded by a Royal Indian Marine officer who would require a commission from the Admiralty; the vessel would fly the white ensign and be under the orders of the^ Naval Commander-in-Chief on this station, and be attached to the Senior Naval Officer's ship in the Persian Gulf. She might be provided and maintained by the Sheikh of Bahrein and partly manned by his subjects, as his interests are primarily affected, but he could have absolutely no control over her movements and actions on the high seas. With regard to paragraph 3 of your letter, the Consul-General at Berbera has recently bought and equipped two armed dhows, and could give you all details, so as to enable an estimate of the cost of one to be arrived at. As far as I am aware, they have each one 3-pounder quick-firing gun. Two Europ eans, one as Captain and one as Mate. The Captain receives ^120 a year. The services of his dhows are confined to the territorial waters of British Somaliland. The dhows recently employed by the Royal Navy in the Gulf of Aden for the suppression of the arms traffic were hired by us at the rate of Rs. 225 a month, which included the services of the native crew. The guns, fittings, etc., were supplied by the ships to which the dhows were attached,' 390. When Lord Curzon visited Bahrein and had an enterview with the Chief on 26th November 1903, the latter said that there had been no piracy in the year, and he did not mention the matter of the armed dhow then or later. Rear-admiral Atkinson Willes told His Excellency that the difficulty was that an armed dhow under the Sheikh could not operate beyond his territorial waters. The Admiral suggested that the Government of India should arm the dhow, if this was really required. Lord Curzon agreed that the matter might stand over till we knew if we should have to strengthen our agency* at Bahrein in view of the customs arrangements and the settlement of foreigners on the island (see Extract of Mr. Dane's note, dated 27th November 1903, on page 18 of Secret E., January 1904, Nos. 118-139). 391. So far as the Turkish Government is concerned, it appears from Mr. End. to Pro No tis Crow's report, dated 17th August 1903. that the Mutassarif of Hasa took measures for the pursuit and capture of Ahmed-bin-Selman, but without any success, and that he had fled towards Koweit side. His trial by default before the Court of Cassation in Nejd was proceeding at the time. 392. In March 1903 a large body of the Behaik Arabs came to a place No i28 called Thahran, south of Katif, whose object, it was feared, was to commit piracies on the pearl fishing boats and other boats, plying between Bahrein, Katif and Ojair. The Chief of Bahrein asked for permission to attack them with the double purpose of taking Icvenge and getting the coast rid of their presence. The Political Resident was opposed to this request being granted. Vide Chapters LVII and LIX.109 but suggested that might be given the permission alluded to in the last para graph of his letter* No. 167, dated 8th December (telegram dated 22nd May 1903)' Notl29&gt; 393. The Government of India tele graphed back to him on 26th May:— ' Bahrein Chief must not attack Behaik Arabs. If Bahrein is threatened or there is risk of serious piracies, naval authorities should be asked to take necessary precautions.' • See paragraph 387 above.

In connection with this case the Chief of Bahrein and other Trucial Chiefs expressed the opinion that no Chief had the right to give any such permission, as the pearlingjbanks were the common property of the Coast Arabs. 406.

Early in 1903 Colonel Kemball reported .that two Frenchmen named Dumas and Castelin had arrived at Bahrein with the intention, it was suspected, of1 12 prospecting the pearl banks round that island. The Chief however refused to entertain any proposals on the subject. Subsequently Monsieur Dumas' Assist ant proceeded to Marseilles. It was supposed that he had gone to engage a diver. The last report received was to the effect that Mons. Dumas had left Bahrein for Baghdad on account of the plague, but it was presumed that he would return later on. 408. The Government of India entirely approved of the Sheikh's action in the matter and advised that in the event of either of these parties re-appearing at Bahrein, the Chief should refuse to render the assistance of any description. Colonel Kemball was to advise the other Chiefs also, who might be similarly approached, to return a similar response (letter No. 778-E.-A,, dated 9th March 1904). 4og. The following despatch (No. 63, dated 10th March 1904) was then addressed to the Secretary of State : — ' In the course of our recent examinations of problems connected with the Persian Gulf, the question of the pearl-fisheries that have so long existed there has come under our notice. Important questions, both of policy and international law, are involved ; and although none of these has fortunately hitherto assumed an acute shape, it seems to us desirable that the matter should be considered now, in order that we may know how to act should any sudden or unexpected development occur. We therefore address you on the subject. 2. The approximate limits of the pearling grounds in the neighbourhood of the Arab littoral are indicated on the enclosed copy of a chart of the Gulf in addition to those marked; there are also shoals in the neighbourhood of Kharak Island and at other points along the Persian Coast, which are regularly exploited and frequently yield considerable returns. We are immediately concerned, however, only with those lying on the Arabian side of the Gulf. Along this coast lie the territories of the several Trucial Chiefs the peninsula of EI Katr, the island of Bahrein, the Turkish province of El Hassa, and the domains of the Sheikh 01 Koweit. The pearl banks appear from time immemorial to have been open, without distinction, to the Arabs of the entire littoral; and though there are no definite inter-tnbal limits, the external boundaries of the fisheries are well known. In- trusion is resented ; the principal Chiefs have in the past expressed the view that the fisheries are common property, and that no Chief has, therefore, the right to grant anv con cession to outside parties; and believing as they do that the shallower waters are deoen- dent on the deeper for their supply of shells, their objections relate not only to interference on the shoals which are habitually fished by their dependents, but also to the exploitation or the deeper waters beyond. ^ A I 3 ' His Majesty s Government are aware of the- close relations which exist between the Arabs of th, 3 coast and the Indian Government. Since 1843 we have held from the Trucal Chiefs agreements to refrain from any breach of the peace at sea, and in .802 the Sheikhs concluded fresh compacts binding themselves not to enter into and agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; not to consent exceot w.th the perrmssion of the British Government, to the residence within their territories 0 the Agent of any other State ; and not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give occum tion of any portion of the.r territories, save to the British Government.

Imprisonment of the Mail Agent at Bahrein by the Chief Sheikh Esau—1873. 414. In June 1873 the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, submitted corres- Political A., July .873, Nos. 353-366. pondence on the above subject. The particulars are as follows:— Abdullah- bin-Rujub, a subject of the Chief of Bahrein and Agent for the British India Steam Navigation Company's Mail Steamers, was suddenly seized by some men of the Chief, Sheikh Esau, and thrown into imprisonment without any cause being assigned for the proceeding. 415. The matter having reached the ears of Assistant Resident, Captain Grant, he immediately wrote to the Chief and told him that it was not right to confine men under British protection without informing him (Assistant Resident) and requested the release of the prisoner. Captain Grant also told the Chief, that whatever complaints he might have against the man he should report them to the Resident and justice would be done. 416. The Chief replied that he had imprisoned Abdullah because he beat his subjects in the bazaar and had cut a great deal of wood from the Chief's forest, and said that it was not contrary to custom to imprison men who take liberty with his (Chief's) subjects and ' it is for no one to interfere.' The Chief however, released Abdullah and wrote to Colonel Ross that he imprisoned the man for faults committed and had released him for Captain Grant's sake ; but he continued— • 'If Abdullah-bin-Rujub goes on in this manner and no justice be done by you all will go wrong.' 417. In answer, Colonel Ross expressed dissatisfaction at the proceedings of the Chief, and told him that the proper course he should have followed in the case was in the first instance to lay the complaints he had against Abdullah before Captain Grant. He observed— ' The tone also of your (Chief's) written reply to Captain Grant has caused me much surprise.' Colonel Ross further requested the Chief to show his— •'friendly wish to prevent any misunderstanding by expressing his regret for not having consulted Captain Grant first and his intention of adopting the course pointed out on all future similar occasions.' 418. Colonel Ross at the same time requested Captain Grant to make a strict enquiry into the charges brought against Abdullah by the Chief. In ac cordance, Captain Grant reported that he enquired into the charges and found that the first charge, that of assault, was correct, but he did not think that the second or graver charge, that of cutting down the trees, had any foundation. 419. The Chief, in reply to Colonel Ross' letter, expressed regret for acting hastily in the matter, and hoped he might be pardoned. He also went to Captain Grant and apologized to him. 420. Colonel Ross, in forwarding the correspondence, expressed a hope that his proceedings in the matter will be approved of by Government. This was done. [C943FDI \118 CHAPTER XLVII. Murder of a member of the Khalifa family by the brother of the ruling Chief of Bahrein, 1877. 421. This occurred on the 28th April 1877, the victim was Fadh bin Ahmed, a first cousin of Ali bin Khalifa, the late Chief of_ Bahrein, and the murderer, Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali, described as a man of ' violent and cruel disposition/' and possessing almost as much influence as his brother Sheikh Esau, the ruling Chief. In the account of the affair given by Sheikh Esau the only justification given for the deed was, that Fadh bin Ahmed having rendered himself ' obnoxious and dangerous,' Sheikh Ahmed was sent to deprive him of his weapons; thereupon he threatened Sheikh Ahmed, 'and thus it came about that we slew him.' In reporting the matter Colonel Prideaux stated that in his opinion the murder was quite unjustifiable, and that the expulsion of Fadh bin Ahmed from Bahrein would have been a sufficiently severe punishment. „ 422. The case was thus disposed of by K. W., Political A., Augu,. .8 77 , No,. 37-4.. ^ Secretary _ ' Bahrein is under the protection of the British Government, which /&gt;er contra insists upon its political insulation under these circumstances :— ' I. The Chief is amenable to our influence and advice. ' II. The inhabitants have only the British Government to look to protect them from oppression. ' This being the case the British Government seem hound, from the position it has assumed, to interfere to prevent grave outrage or oppression by the ruling power, or at any rate not to remain an unconcerned spectator of acts of violence, such as that now reported, but to use the great influence it possesses for their suppression. I therefore concur in Colonel Prideaux's suggestion that he should be authorized to convey to Sheikh Esau and his brother emphatic disapproval of the deed which they have committed and a warning against its repetition.' This was accordingly done.tig CHAPTER XLVIII. Death of Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali bin Khalifa, brother of the Chief of Bahrein, and its evil effect upon the Sheikh Esau, October 1888. 4^3. Sheikh Ahmed bin All, brother of the Chief of Bahrein, and the sharer External a., January 1889, Nos. 21-24. ^ lls es t^te, his chief adviser and support j• 1 r 1, . „ ln tIie government of the tribes in Bahrein items - 0X in HiS aSSetS consisted following One-third of the landed estates, date plantations, etc., annual Rs. revenue of which was about ... 40,200 One-half of the customs revenues valued at ... ... 33800 Cash amount ... ... ... ... 8o&gt;000 (of which Rs. 20,000 were in custody of the firm of Ali bin Ibrahim in Bombay and Rs. 4,000 had been lent to Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab), The price of the date crop sold by Sheikh Ahmed to be Rs. recovered ... ... ... ... ... 6)000 424. On Ahmed's^ death Sheikh Esau took possession of all his estates and money, and fixed certain allowances for the support of his children (8 young sons and several daughters). But they were not satisfied with the small amounts fixed by the Chief and demanded more. (See Chapter LVI post.) From the.report of the Residency Agent it appeared that the death of Sheikh Ahmed would weaken the power of Sheikh Esau in both external and internal affairs. The reasons are explained in the following extract of the Agent's report:— 'As regards your enquiry as to' whether this event will weaken or strengthen External A., January tSSg. Nos. 2 ,-24. th ? P ° Wer of T S J leikh EsaU i n external and fnter- nal affairs, I beg to say that Sheikh Esau's power will be weakened in every way, because Sheikh Ahmed was of great help to Sheikh Esau, in giving his counsel and views in all matters, whether internal or foreign, and he was in fact Sheikh Esau's sword. The two brothers were loyal and sincere to each other. ' People used to fear, in secret, Sheikh Ahmed, particularly so all their other brothers and relatives, and Sheikh Ahmed was a strong support to Sheikh Esau. Sheikh Esau is now single-handed, and he feels very much the loss of Sheikh Ahmed; and now there is no one who can take the place of Sheikh Ahmed. After the death of Sheikh Ahmed I visited Sheikh Esau pn two or three occasions, and I found that his thoughts were unsettled, because he is now left alone ; while people, both internal and foreign, call upon him with some object, the main object being to receive presents. Sheikh Esau's former Vazier, Abdul Wahab, owing to great age, had become weak in mind and judgment, he has there fore given his son Abdul Rahman as his substitute ; but the son is not equal to his father. In all internal affairs the relatives and attendants of Sheikh Esau, as also the attendants of Sheikh Ahmed, give their counsel and advice to Sheikh Esau; their views are manifold. Sheikh Esau is very slow in conducting affairs and carrying out matters.' 425. Sheikh Esau's special weakness was his fear that the Bedoum tribes External a , Octobenssp, Nos. 221.222. ^ ata r&gt; Hasa .and Katif might make a combination with Sheikh Nasir bin Ch'haban, 'cl'' Ajman ' Morrah ' Naim, ChobeS3a ' Mubarak against him. Many of these tribes* instigated by Nasir, began after Ahmed's death to cross over to the island, and in order to buy their fidelity to his own cause Sheikh Esau paid them presents. The plan adopted by Nasir was a simple one.^ He suggested to the tribes as a means of securing a free passage to go to ' Darien and remain with Abdul Wahab as his guest or to remain with Abdur Rahman, the Chief of Seyyhat, in which case these persons would have no other remedy for getting rid of their guests but to send them to Bahrein.120 CHAPTER XLIX. Memorial from Yusuf bin Ibrahim regarding his claim to certain date plantation in Bahrein, 1889-1892. 426. In 1892 one Yusuf bin Ibrahim submitted a memorial to the Govern ment of India regarding his alleged dispossession by the Chief of Bahrein of certain date plantations in the districts of Shakare and Bimel. The facts of the case as reported by the Political Resident are briefly these. 427. Ibrahim bin Yusuf, father of the petitioner, was an Utubi oi Bahrein, disaffected towards the Chief, but he e *tern&amp;i a., January 1893, Nos. 79-?9. enjoyed the good offices of the Residency by virtue of naturalization papers obtained by him whilst residing in Bombay. Some years before his death, which occurred in 1889 at Darein in Turkish terri tory, he returned to Bahrein and took up his residence there. He had a claim against one Esau bin Tarif of Bahrein, and at the intervention of Major Grant, then Assistant Political Resident, the present Chief of Bahrein settled it by handing over to him one of the date plantations now referred to. The other plantation was presented to Ibrahim bin Yusuf by the Chief in token of his reconciliation on his return to Bahrein ; both plantations being resumed on the owner's death at Darein. 428. The petitioner was the eldest son of Ibrahim bin Yusuf, who left a large family. At his father's death he was residing in Bombay, and on return to Bahrein was appointed by the Chief to administer the estate. The other heirs, however, objected, in petitions to the Residency, on the ground of Yusufs in competency and of his being in the hands of one Abdul Wahab, a notoriously unprincipled person. On this Colonel Ross pointed out to the Chief of Bahrein that certain British subjects had interests in the estate and asked him to see that it was justly and fairly administered. The Chief in reply informed the Resident that he had found Yusuf incompetent and had therefore transferred the adminis tration to the Kazi. 429. Colonel Ross approved of this course and subsequently declined to interfere further. The Chief of Bahrein promised to use his endeavours to bring the matter to a speedy settlement. 430. The petitioner then submitted a memorial to the Government of India , „ . .. who, however, rejected the petition. External B., April 1902, Nos. 42-52- . J r 431. He then submitted a memorial to the Secretary of State, which too . A T - M q was rejected and the petitioner was inform- External A., January 1893, Nos. 79-89. , .

Murder of the Arab Chief, Sultan bin Salema, by the Amamera tribe of Bahrein, 1895. Claims of his family to his property, 1895-99. 432. Soon after the events noted in chapter the Sheikh of the A1 bin Ali „ t , » .. 0 M „ tribe Sultan bin Salema, was murdered. External A. May 1899, Nos. 70 71. tt 1 1 • 1 • 1 • i 1 1 He had remained in his boat alone when his followers landed at Ras Tanura and was seen by three men of the Amamera tribe of Bahrein, who had also landed and met Sultan's followers on shore. Hearing that the Sheikh was alone in his boat, they went alongside and shot him dead, after which they re-embarked and went to Bahrein. 433. At this time H.M.S. Pigeon was at Bahrein, and the Com mander, fearing that the incident would give rise to fresh complications, communicated with Sheikh Esau, through the Residency Agent, asking him to detain the murderers, if found in Bahrein, pending a reference to Colonel Wilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Sheikh Esau, in reply, denied all knowledge of them, but promised to make enquiries. 434. In December 1895 a petition was received at the Bushire Residency from the son and mother of Sultan bin Salema in which they insinuated that he had been murdered at the instigation of Sheikh Esau, who had also, they stated, dis possessed them of their property in Bahrein. 435. Before taking any steps in the case. Colonel Wilson reported the murder to the Government of India in his telegram, dated the soth December 1895, and as the matter was left to his discretion, he subsequently wrote to Sheikh Esau, urging him to do justice according to Arab law. The Sheikh in reply promised to do so, but did nothing. To anticipate events, we may men tion here that in December 1899 Colonel Meade received a further petition from Sultan's mother and followers, a number of whom came to see him at Bushire. They repeated their grievances against Sheikh Esau, and demanded justice, urging that, as we protected him from his enemies, we should see that he did what was right and just. 436. In reporting the facts, Colonel Meade observed and suggested (letter No. 26, dated 12th March 1899) :— ' The matter is not one in which the British Government are directly concerned, and my predecessor appears to have taken it up in consequence of a report that it was thought Sheikh Esan had instigated the murder. If we had done nothing, it might have been said that we tacitly acquiesced in the Sheikh's conduct, and Colonel Wilson's interference was probably taken with the object of removing this impression. As the Sheikh had not ful filled his promise to in Colonel Wilson, I propose, if the Government of India approve, urging him to do so, and in any case I think he ought to see that the deceased Sheikh's family are not interfered with as regards the produce of their landed property in Bahrein. It appears impolitic as well as unjust for the Sheikh to allow this.' 437. The Government of India agreed in Colonel Meade's conclusions in the matter and authorized him to proceed as he proposed. (Foreign Department letter No. 615-E. A., dated 24th April 1899.) [ C 943 FD ]122 CHAPTER LI. Question of redress for outrages committed by Bahreinese on British subjects or British-protected subjects, 1897-1900. 438. This question arose firstly in a case in 1897 : —Seyyid Khalaf, a ban- Imprsition of a fine on certain officials, of the krupt trader of Bahrein whilst beino- con- Sheikh of Bahrein, who forcibly removed are- ,* c i fugee from the British agency house there, 1897. V^yed in charge 01 oheildha, One of the Q o XT c o Sheikh of Bahrein's officials, to the house External A. ( januar y xS.s, Nos. 80 -83. ^ of one Mujbel-el-Thakair, to be examined there in connection with his liabilities, escaped and sought refuge in the house of Mahomed Khalil, who was then acting as British Agent. Sheridah followed and eventually seized and carried back Seyyid Khalaf with the assistance of another man, against the protest of the Acting British Agent on the ground that he had taken refuge in the British Agency and should not be given up. 439. Colonel Meade in addressing the Sheikh of Bahrein on the subject said that he did not consider there was anything in Seyyid Khalaf's case to entitle him to receive British protection, and that when his officials found that the man had come into the Agency enclosure, they should have asked the Agent's permission to remove him. He accordingly suggested that the Sheikh should levy a fine of Rs. 500 from each of the men, and should cause them to send a written apology expressing their regret. The Sheikh complied with both the requests. He was requested to remit the fine to Bushire to be disposed of as the Government of India may direct. Colonel Meade suggested that the amount be credited to Government in the cash account of the Bushire treasury. 440. The Government of India approved of Colonel Meade's action in the matter and ordered that the fine realized should be credited in the Bushire treasury (letter No. 1921-E.A., dated the 27th December 1897). 44 1. x second case arose thus :—Sheridah and his son went about q P.m on Outrage on certain Banians by Sheikh's *3^ September 1^-99 t 0 ^he ' Amara,' servant bheridah and his son, 1899. or large enclosure where goods are stored External A., January igoo. Nos. 126-144. after P asSin g through the Customs. The entrance had a room over it occupied by a Banian, named Rama, who was in charge of the 'Amara.' Below were several godowns, in one of which some of the arms confiscated by the Sheikh from Messrs. Francis, Times &amp; Co., were stored, it was alleged that the object of the visit of Sheridah to the ' Amara ' was to steal these arms. 442. Rama hearing a noise came down, and stated that on finding Sheridah his son, and some soldiers apparently engaged in taking away a case of arms he raised an alarm which brought several other Banians to the spot. Sheridah annoyed at the interruption, compelled Rama to return to his room, and, having done this, turned on the other Banians, who attempted to escape. He caught up one, named Faisi, and inflicted a severe wound with a dagger in the nei^h' bourhood of his right shoulder-blade. His son at the same time^sKghtly wound ed another Banian boy, named Dhar Singh. 443. Evidence against the accused was given by the Banians who witnessed the assault, and as it was bright moonlight at the time there was nothincr to prevent their identifying the parties. The Chief, however, for some time declared that the complaint rested entirely on the evidence of Hindus, whom he did not trust and he said that as the charge was denied by the servants, he did not consider U was proved against them. In any case he thought a fine was quite sufficient and he did his utmost to induce Colonel Meade to agree to this. , 444- Colonel Meade however, thought that nothing short of the expulsion ox Sheridah and his son from Bahrein would really meet the case. Sheridah had much influence with the Sheikh for some years ; and if he had been allowed to remain at the Bahrein, he would probably have been guilty of further lawless acts wane his presence would certainly have been a constant source of dread to' hostile nianS 0 r BritIsh Sllb i ects t0 whom he was always shown himself123 1 445- The Sheikh was at last induced to banish Sheridah and his son, but Colonel Meade thought it advisable to warn Sheikh Esau that he should not allow the man to return without the consent of the British authorities. Colonel Meade felt that he was convinced the Sheikh was all along aware of the man's guilt, but wished to shield him from the consequences of his act, as he had been so many years in his service, and was one of the greatest friends. He felt too that this being well known he would suffer in the eyes of his subjects if he were obliged to punish the man severely, and he did his utmost to avoid having to do this. 446. The Sheikh's other old servant, Amir Saleh bin Rashid, who was the Bazaar Master, was also present at the time the Banian was stabbed and, as he was responsible for the maintenance of law and order in the Bazaar, his conduct in not taking notice of what occurred merited severe notice. Colonel Meade, however, thought that as the Sheikh had at last dealt with Sheridah and his son, it was not desirable to urge him to punish Amir Saleh also, and he contented himself with asking the Sheikh to warn him that he', too would be liable to punishment if the British subjects were not properly guarded and looked after in Bahrein. A fine of Rs. 1,000 was also levied from Sheridah and his son. As regards the disposal of the fine, Colonel Meade recommended that Rs. 400 might be paid to the Banian Farsi, who had been severely wounded and who had been put to some expense in consequence, and that Rs. 50 be given to the boy, Dhar Singh, whose wound was a mere scratch. The balance Rs. 550 could be paid into the Government treasury at Bushire, or could if the Govern ment approved, be utilized in putting an enclosure round six graves of English officers and seamen, which were then situated in an open plain, just outside the town. The uncared for condition of these graves had been remarked on, and he (Colonel Meade) thought the opportunity might be taken to have them enclosed by alow wall, which could be erected for the sum he had mentioned. 447. The Government of India decided (letter No. 172-E.A., dated 18th January 1900) that the disposal of the fine which was levied by the Sheikh should be left to him to determine, should he agree to distribute a suitable sum as compen sation to the persons injured : there was no objection to that course so far as the Government of India were concermed. 448. Sheridah was allowed subsequently External a., December iqoo, Nos. 40-41. , . i • .1 £ External a., April 1901, No. 13. to return to Bahrein on the guarantee ot the Sheikh for his good behaviour. 449. As regards the fine, Colonel Meade suggested subsequently that it should not be left to the discretion of the Chief to dispose of, but should be recovered as an indemnity and disposed by Government in the manner suggested by him (Politi cal Resident). In Colonel Meade's opinion to leave the disposal of the fine in the Chief's hands would result in a relaxation of our hold on the Chief and would affect the future working of Article 4 of the Convention. The Government of India in the circumstances directed that the fine should be disposed of in the manner suggested by the Resident. (Foreign Department letter No. 834 -E.A., dated 10th April 1900,)124 CHAPTER LII. Proposed establishment at Bahrein of a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, 1900. 450. M. Van Lennep, the Manager of the Shiraz Branch of the Imperial Secret Nobember .900, Nos. 35-2S. Bank . of j 11 accordance within- structions received by him from his Board of Directors in London, visited Bahrein in June 1900, with a view to ascertain whether it would be worth while to open a branch of the Bank at Bahrein. He felt satisfied that the Bank would make a profitable business, and submitted his report accordingly to the Board in London. The Chief was not favourably disposed to the scheme, as it would prejudice the interests of the Baniah Savkars of the place, to whom the Chief was indebted considerably and who made a lucrative business by levying exorbitant interests. The Chief accordingly wrote to Colonel Kemball objecting to the proposed scheme. Colonel Kemball did not reply the Chief's letter, and Instructed Mr. Gaskin to lose no opportunity of endeavouring to influence him to take a right view of the matter. Colonel Kemball thought that the establishment of the Bank in Bahrein should receive every encouragement at our hands as tending to increase the commer cial prosperity of the place and at the same time to advance our own political interest.I2S CHAPTER LIII. Prohibition against the importation of intoxicating liquors into Bahrein, 1900. External A., Feb™,, , m No,, i j -. s , 45' • The Chief of Bahrein issued on 28th beptember 1900 the following notice to the public :—• (s Be it known to all who may see this notification that whereas I hear that intoxicating liquor is being imported into Bahrein for purpose of trade and whereas it is forbidden by the Shara laws of Islam and is injurious to the body: I do hereby prohibit its importation into Bahrein ; should I come to know that it has been imported for sale, it will be seized and I will order its being thrown into the sea'. The Chief sent a copy of this notice to Mr. Gaskin, with a request that it iT&gt;ay be notified to the importers of the liquor, which he believed was brought in the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamers. One of the reasons which induced the Chief to take this step was the arrival of Mr. Waukhaus, the Lingah representative of the German Trading Company, who, it was reported, was endeavouring to effect the introduction of cheap liquors into Lingah. Colonel Kemball was of opinion that the Chief had acted within his rights and that no exception could be taken by the British subjects or others to the prohi bition in question. Mr. Gaskin suggested that a copy of the notification should be forwarded to the Foreign Consuls in Bushire, but Colonel Kemball thought that this was not necessary. 452. The Government of India directed (letter No. 232 i-E. A., dated 18th December 1900) that no objection be taken to the Sheikh's proceedings so long as Europeans were not prevented from importing liquor for their private use, and that the prohibition should be notified to the Foreign Consuls at Bushire and the British India Steam Navigation Company. This Company 's steamers, which apparently carried all the liquor, would then refuse such cargo for Bahrein and no difficulty would arise. [C943FD]126 CHAPTER LIV. (i) Medical arrangements at Bahrein. (2) Proposed erection of a hospital at Bahrein in commemoration of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria, 1901-1903. 453. The first hospital and dispensary at Bahrein was established in 1902 by the American Arabian Mission with accommodation for 21 beds and called Mason Memorial Hospital. The doctor attached to the American Mission was retained for attendance on the Assistant Political Agent, and his establishment on a remuneration of Rs. 5° a month with effect from 1st November. 1901 {see paragraph 470/w/j. 453-A. In November 1901 the senior partner of the firm of Messrs. Gangaram External a, December 1902, Nos. 18—24. Tikamdas at Bahrein offered a sum of .... Rs- 5. 000 towards the erection of a hospital in commemoration of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria. The Indian merchants of Bahrein highly appreciated the blessings of free trade and peace they had enjoyed under British protection during the reign of the late Queen and many more merchants, Mr. Gaskin expected, would come forward with subscriptions, so that he would be able to collect altogether Rs. loooo which would be required for a suitable building, provided Government cou'ld spare the services of an Assistant Surgeon and sanction the initial expenditure required tor the surgical equipment of the hospital and annual grant of Rs. 500 to defrav the cost of medicines The advantages of an hospital like this, which would be non-sectarian would be very much appreciated by all sections of the various communities of Bahrein, and its indirect political influence would not be small as^ a turther ' material proof of our authority over the island ' The then existing medical arrangements even for the British Agency were not ouitp satisfactory. The medical officer attached to the Arabian Mission house at Bahrein were retained for six months with effect from 1st November iqoi (Government of India, letter* No. 923-E.

Colonel Kemball, who was asked to give a further opinion in the matter as U was not clear what poht.cal advantages would ensue from the appointment of a Muhammadan Assistant Surgeon sufficient to justify the outlay that would be incurred, stated that there was, in his opinion, no doubt that a charitable dis pensary at Bahrein would be appreciated by the people, and did not consider it of much importance whether a European or Muhammadan Assistant Surgeon was placed m charge. The department noted that as Colonel Kemball did n-n support the proposal very strongly, the Government of India might undertake to incur an expenditure Rs. 3,650 a year, provided that additional subscrip- tions were forthcoming sufficient to build a suitable hospital with quarters for the staff as proposed by Mr. Gaskm, and suggested that the Finance Department might be asked to agree to the Resident being addressed to this effect. Lord Curzon noted :— 1 think we may perhaps go as far as this ; though I am a little sceptical as to the fructifying of the scheme. 456-B From the recent reports it appears that the movement has met with considerable success, as much as Rs. 14,630 having been collected and Rs. 400 more promised (see Major Cox s letter No. 246, dated 6th August 1904), The Political Resident submitted in August last plans and estimates (the latter amounting to Rs. 15,000), which have been sanctioned by Government (Foreign Department letter No. 2899-E.

Excessive transhipment fees at Bahrein, 1903- 457. In May 1903 attention of the Government of India was drawn to the excessive transhipment fees levied at External a, August iqo3, Nos. ioq-x 10. Bahrein at the rate of 2| per cent .j that is, half the customs duty, which is 5 P er cent., on account of a complaint made by the Agent of the British Indian Firm of Haji Ismail Haji Allana, whose con signment from Calcutta to Koweit, transhipped at Bahrein was charged this rate The Government of India in writing to the Political Resident observed (letter No. I663-E., dated 23rd July 1903) 'The Sheikh's action in countenancing so excessive a rate of duty seems to be unwise and not unlikely to injure the trade of Bahrein; this should be clearly explained to the Sheikh who should be informed that universal experience is against such transit duties which should, in the Sheikh's own interests, be limited to what is required to cover the cost of customs supervision. As the British Government have no agreement with the Chief on the subject, and as he has farmed his Customs (including the per cent, trans shipment dues), nothing can, apparently, be done until the termination of the contrac. In the opinion of the Government of India, the duty in question should be reduced to at least one per cent, and even to less on articles in bulk, such as coal and grains. The earliest convenient oppartunity should be taken to secure a reduction.'lag CHAPTER LVI. Certain differences between the Chief of Bahrein and his nephew Ali bin Ahmed-bin-Ali, 1899-1904. 458. Since the death of Ahmed, Sheikh Esau's brother, domestic peace of Bahrein was frequently disturbed by family dissensions, arising principally out of the discontent of Ahmed's sons at the smallness of the allowances granted them by the Chief, and their exclusion from the administration. The dissensions grew gradually to such alarming extent, that the Political Resident had to interfere. Colonel Meade's report No. 25, dated 12th March 1899, deals fully with the mattec :— ' 1 have the honour to report on the steps I have taken regarding certain differences External A., May 1899. Nos. 68-69. which have arisen between Sheikh Isa, Ruler ol Bahrein, and his nephew Sheikh Ali bin Ahined bin Ali. ' 2. Ahmed bin Ali was a brother of Sheikh Isa and died in October 1888, as will be seen from the narrative portion of Aitchison's Treaties, Volume X, page 1 io , relating to Bahrein. He was not the onlv brother of Sheikh Isa, as another is still living, and it appears that he enjoyed a third, and not a moiety of the revenues of the island. The sentence—'The Chief of Bahrein has since appointed his eldest son as successor to his late brother ' refers evidently to his own son. Sheikh Selman, who died in 1894, and not, as might be thought, to a son of Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali, whose son, Ali, has not succeeded his late father. '3. Ali bin Ahmed was 18 years of age when his father died, and is now, therefore, about a8. He came to see me when 1 visited Bahrein in February 1898, and complained that Sheikh Isa was keeping him out of estates and income which he ought to inherit from his father. &lt;{ He claimed also that he should succeed to the authority his father exercised. ' I told him then that I would enquire into the claims, and I did so as opportunity offered till November last, when I received information that the state of affairs between him and his uncle was becoming more and more strained, and an Agent came to me from Ali, begging me to assist him without delay. '4. On this I wrote to Sheikh Isa and his nephewi and advised them both to refrain then from any further action likely to cause trouble, and promised to endeavour to settle their differences in a satisfactory manner when I reached Bahrein. ' 5. I found that the Sheikh accuses his nephew of interfering in the government of the country, and of forming a party adverse to himself. There seemed a good deal of ground for this accusation, and I heard that Sheikh All's supporters intended to put him forward as a rival successor to the Sheikhship in the place of Hamad, Sheikh Isa's own son. The first thing, therefore, that I did was to insist on Sheikh Ali promising to obey his uncle, and not to interfere in the Government. I told him that the Sheikh was the Ruler of Bahrein, and that it lay with him to employ any one he liked to assist him in the government. '6. Sheikh Ali having agreed to obey his uncle, I impressed on Sheikh Isa that he ought to give him a sufficient income to enable him to live in a manner befitting the son of his brother, who was, to some extent, associated with himself, and enjoyed, during his lifetime, a cpnsiderably large income than Ali has. As Sheikh Isa had benefitted by his brother's death to the extent of receiving a great portion of the property he had, he ought to increase his nephew's income to a reasonable extent, 'now that he fully grown up, and had an establishment of his own to maintain. ' 7. The Sheikh declared that Ali's income was ample, and as such as he could appear, as he was supporting other sons and daughters of Ahmed, as well as some fifty members of the Khalifa family. To settle this, I advised the Sheikh and his nephew to submit tlieir respective claims to the decision of an informal court, composed of members of the family, and, after prolonged discussion, it was eventually decided that the Sheikh should give his nephew Rs. 600 per mensem, in addition to an annual allowance of Rs. 800, payable during the date season, and leave him in possession of landed property, worth, at least, as much more. That in return for this Sheikh Ali should give a promise to obey his uncle and not interfere in any way in public matters. ' 8. I intended reducing the agreement to writing, but at the last _ moment, Sheikh Ali said he felt sure a written agreement would annoy his uncle, and that it was not necessay, as they were now quite reconciled to each other. The Sheikh too appeared to prefer a verbal agreement, and publicly declared that he would, in future, regard and treat Sheikh Ali as his own son. [C943FD]13° '' g. It remains to be seen how the new agreement works : but it has, for the present at any rate, put an end to dissensions, which might have caused a good deal of trouble in Bahrein, and I trust that the Government of India will approve of any action in mediating between Sheikh Isa and his nephew. 31 The differences, however, did not end here as had been ^ anticipated by Colonel Meade. Sheikh Ali frequently Secret e ., July 1904, Nos. assess- complained to the Residency in general terms of his uncle's treatment. But when asked to particularize he always failed to do so. In June 1901 he made a journey to Maskat. He was anxious to pay a visit to Mons. Oitavi, the French Consul, but failed to see him, as the latter was away at Sur. He complained to the Sultan of Maskat of the injustice done to him by Sheikh Esau and of the treatment accorded to him by the British Government. On the other hand, Sheikh Esau complained that Sheikh Ali was in the habit of usurping some of his authority. Mr. Gaskin proposed that a Durbar should be held at Bahrein, at which it should be publicly announced that as long as Sheikh Esau acted up to his obligations to the British Government, he would receive the support of our Government for the maintenance of his authority. Major Cox seconded this proposal. But the Government of India decided in view of the proposed appointment of a Political Agent at Bahrein (see ^ 2S4 * ' ' despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 85-E, dated 21st April 1904) to postpone the issue of orders pending a decision on the question of the arrangements for our future representational Bahrein.I3i CHAPTER LVII. Vol Proposals (i) to recognise the Bahrein Chiefs son Hamed as his suc cessor designate, ^2) to take oyer the control of the Bahrein cus toms, and (3; to appoint a Pclitical Agent at Bahrein, 1899 1900. 460. In 1898 the Political Resident, Bushire, Colonel Meade submitted the Secret E., November 1898, Nos. 524-535. above proposals. Their origin and the grounds on which they were based are ex plained in the following despatch of the Government of India to the Secretary of State (INo. 194, dated 27th October 1898). No. 104, (Secret-External), dated Simla, the 27th October 1S93. From —The Government ot India, Foreign Department, To— The Right Hon'ble Lord George F. Hamilton, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, The Sheikh of Bahrein has expressed * a desire that the British Governmrnt J-houM * Enclosures Nos. 1 and 2. recognise his eldest son, Sheikh Hained, as suc cessor designate to the Chiefship. Lieutenant- Colonel Meade is of opinion that it is desirable to take a more decided position in respect to Bahrein : he recommends that we should accede to the Sheikh's request, and that advantage should be taken of the opportunity to secure control of the customs of Bahrein and to appoint, as our representative in the island, a Political Officer of higher rank than our present Agent. 2. The Chief of Bahrein is bound, under the terms of the Agreement signed on the A*i. u' &gt; t' x* e , . p.. . . 22nd December 1880, ' to abstain from entering Vtde Aitchison s Treaties, &amp;c., (3rd Edition), • .^ i • , r ^ Jl. x, pages 120-121. in . to negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots' in his territory, without similar consent. The Chief is also entitled, under , .• f » certain circumstance's.f to British support for t Ibtdt pages 118-119. Convention of Ihe 31st • . c ■ r , ^ May 1861. the maintenance of the security of his posses sions, and British subjects of every denomination may reside and carry on lawful trade in Bahrein territories. 3. Under these circumstances, it does not appear to us that our position in respect to Bahrein stands in need of revision; while it is a maxim of general policy to avoid inter ference in the internal affairs of a Chiefship and particularly in dynastic disputes. The , 0 , , , , —. . r, weakness ot the present Sheikh's rule has. t See despatch from the Ltovernment of India, 1 • &lt;• No. 191, dated the 23rd October 1^74. ho\\e\e , given rise J in the past to intrigues for the restoration of the exiled branch of his family; he has four sons; and, if the succession remainb undecided, there may be risk of disturbances, on the Sheikh's death, which would be detrimental to British interests. On the whole therefore, and taking into consideration the opinions of the local officers as recorded in the enclosures to the Political Resident's letter of the 13th June 1898, we are disposed, as at present advised, to authorise the recognition of Sheikh Hamed as heir to the Chiefship ; but, before replying to Lieutenant-Colonel Meade, we desire to learn whether Her Majesty's Government have any advice or instructions to offer at the present stage. 4. The present Agent at Bahrein, Aga Muhommad Rahim, was appointed as such in November 1893 and receives an allowance of Rs. 100 a month ; he is one of the largest traders in the is land where he owns considerable property. In October last we heard from Colonel Meade that complaints against the Agent had been made by British Indian traders, and that the Agent was not in favour with the Sheikh. Colonel Meade inclined to the opinion that the Agent, who is of advanced age, should retire, and thought it possible that a more suitable arrangement might be made, without increased expense, if the Sheikh agreed to our taking over control of the customs. Colonel Meade proposed, however, to visit Bahrein and make local enquiries before submitting specific recommenda tions. The control of the customs should secure an effective check on the trade in arms ; and, as regards British and Indian interests in Bahrein, we may quote tne following figures from the Administration Report of the Persian Gulf Political Residency for 1897-98;— Value in Rs. omitting Coo. Total. India. Value in Rs. omitting 000. Total. Exports from Bahrein principal countries Imports to Bahrein from ( q '^ principal Cuuntties, India.

The suggestion for the appointment to Bahrein of a Political Officer of higher rank than the present Agent is too indefinite for us to base upon it any recommendation; but we expect a further report from Lieutenant-Colonel Meade in connection with Your Lordship's Secret despatch, No. 20, dated the 12th August 1898, which called, inter alia, for information respecting the position of the British Agent, his duties and his powers. If the Political Resident is authorised to recognise Sheikh Hamed as successor to the Chiefship be might, perhaps, simultaneously inform the prfsent Sheikh, in general terms that we shculd welcome some improved arrangement in respect to the customs (should no reform have meanwhile been effected) ; and we should require the Resident to report as to the nature and extent of the advantages to British commerce which might accrue therefrom. We should be prepared to lend the Sheikh the services of a qualified officer to manage his customs, and, if this were done, the Resident might be able to simulta neously devise some more suitable arrangement than that now in force for the discharge of local political duties in Bahrein. 461. The Secretary of State approved of the proposals and expressed the opinion that the loan of a qualified officer Secret E., March 1899, Nos, 27-31. to n - )ana g e ^ sheikh 's customs would be of considerable advantage (despatch No. 44, dated 16th December 1899). The Resident was accordingly told by us (letter No. 205, E. A., dated 7th February 1899) that he might inform the Sheikh of Bahrein that the Government of India were pleased to recognize his eldest son as successor designate to the chief- ship, and at the same time that he should endeavour to induce the Sheikh to reform his customs by applying for ai officer from British India to manage them. 462. Colonel Meade visited the Chief with a view to carry out these instruc tions, but he found that Sheikh Esau had external a., May 1900, 03 .8-107. renewed the lease of his customs to a firm of Baniahs for another two years. The Sheikh, however, promised not to enter into any fresh agreement with them without informing the Political Resident. Colonel Meade at the same time suggested that Government might advance a loan to the Sheikh on condition of his entrusting the management of his customs to an officer lent by the Government of India. 463. In reply we said that if Colonel Meade would report the approximate sum required and would propose suitable terms for repayment, the matter of the loan would receive consideration, and we authorised him to use his discretion as to making known or with holding the orders regarding the succession. 464. On 8th January 1900, however, Colonel Meade reported that the „ . X1 Sheikh had a^ain given the Baniahs a further Secret E., April 1900, No. 44. . . r n * i -ri lease tor two years from March 1902. 1 he Sheikh's reluctance to employ a British Official for his customs was partly due to his dread that we might make it an excuse to interfere gradually more and more in the internal affairs of his chiefship and partly, to his fear that the Baniahs, who had made him large advances and from whom he used to make irregular exac tions, would stop their payments to him, if he transferred the customs collections to the British, 465. Colonel Kemball soon after succeeded Colonel Meade as Political Resi dent, and in his letter, No. 294, dated 24th December 1900 suggested that the orders regarding succession might be communicated to the Chief. He observed:— . 4 In my opinion, it is advisable that the official notification to the Chief, that the Secret E., January 1901, Nos. 108-1IO. Government of India have been pleased to re cognize his son as his successor, should no longer be withheld. It is true that the Chief has not as yet seen fit to introduce reform in the administration of his customs, and although I took the opportunity of my recent visit to Bahrein to talk over the matter with him, pointing out to him the benefit which'33 ™ -fo-. and alludlng t0 the his own customs administration.

The news was also received with v r m 1 • . niuch satisfaction by the members of the ruling family, and it was believed that the recognition of an heir before the demise ,7 a l ca culated to dispel the aspirations of any other candidate for the chiefship and check any possible intrigues.

The question ot improv! g ^ pol f tical dlltIes in Bahrein was taken External A., May 1900, Nos. 88-107. U p Government of India side by side with the Question of the reform of the customs administration. Colonel Meade was of opinion that the appointment of a political officer should be d.stmct from That of Director of the Customs. In this view the Government of Ind.a concurred and Colonel Meade was asked to submit definite proposals as to the status, pay, ^tabUshment duties, etc.. of the political officer to be a P po.nted._This was done in Colonel Meade's letter, No. 128, dated 24th September 1899. ' 2 I consider that the presence of an English officer is desirable at Bahrein in view of the great increase in British interest which has taken place there of recent years. The whole trade of the place is virtually British ; and the increase during the past 20 years Si he seen from our Trade returns during that period. Imports, which in 1878 amoun^d to Rs. 22,29,177, stood at Rs. 88,27,650 in 1898, while exports had risen from 81 oo. in 1878 to Rs. 70.40.880 in i 8 q 8. These figures, I think, speak for them- selves and shew thlt Bahrein^ being generally regarded as under British protection, is becoming more and more the emporium for the trade of the adjacent Arab Coast. « In 1 88 1, Colonel Ross, writing * to the Government of India, observes that 'a ^ ' good deal of interest, commercial, quasi-commer- Letter No. 203, dated the 14th October 1881. ^ an ^ political, is centering, or is about to do so, in the countries adjacent to the Gulf. &gt; Fresh steamship Companies English and Foreign, are being organized; the attention of foreign officers is directed to south west of Persia etc.'. These remarks referred to _ the Persian Gulf generally : but, I think thev apply with special force as anticipating what has occurred at Bahrein m Mrtkul^^nd there^s no doubt that the prediction has been fulfilled. Our interests in Bahrein are far more important than they were and, as the Government of India are aware, other nations are gradually waking up to the importance of the place. 4 At present there seem to be specially strong grounds for strengthening our position at Bahrein. Sheikh Esau is an old man, who, during his earlier years, used to act in con- formity with the advice he received from the British Residency. Of late, however, he seems to have become more susceptible to the influence of persons from o^her nations and his chief advisers are now Turkish or French. This change in his attitude is probably due, in part, to dislike to Agha Muhammed Rahim, who has, for some years, been our r epresentative in the place. 5. Prior to the reduction of the Residency Staff in 1879,, the First Assistant Resident resided constantly, for a portion of the year, in the Island ; but, since then, the Chief and his people only see the Resident or his Assistant occasionally, and much more is conse quently, left in the hands of the Native Agent, who is unpopular with the merchants, as his commercial dealings clash with theirs, and with the Chief whose actions he has to bring to the notice of the Residency. 6 The appointment oF an English officer, who will be confined to his own official duties will attract more British Firms to Bahrein, for, already there are two or three who are commencing to open up dealings with the place, and the number will certainly be increased if we are properly represented on the Island. The presence of such an officer will inspire the Chief with greater confidence, than he has at present, in the motives and actions of the representative of the Government of India. An increased sense of security will, no doubt, follow, and the Sheikh will be obliged to attend more to the wishes and advice of our Government than he has been doing of late. The rights of our traders ^ill be less interfered with, and they will know where to apply for assistance and redress. There will be fewer fraudulent transactions, in which British subjects are concerned. Claims, whether arising out of business transactions or from thefts and robberies, will be settled more promptly, and there will be an end to the squeezing of British subjects by the Sheikh, and his officers, and of the intrigues which now go on between the Bamahs and the Sheikh, either over Customs contracts, or in business matters.between themselves. 7. I think the above remarks deal, in part, with your enquiry as to the duties of the Political Officer : but in addition I would point out that he will be the accredited channel of communication between the Residency and the Chiefs within his Political charge. He will be their adviser, and will report all matters of interest that may come to his notice.

The Political Officer's charge will be an extensive one if, as I propose he is employed in visiting the whole of the Arab coast from the Mussendum Peninsula to Koweit, and it will, I think be necessary to provide a liberal allotment for travelling which he should be encourageed to do constantly. &amp; wmLn . 'v | a m o f 0 P ini0n that the post should be held by an officer on the graded list of the Political Department; but he ought to know Arabic at any rate colloquially, and it may be necessary to bring in some one from outside the Political Department. There are undoubtedly strong objections to employing natives of India or Eurasians In posts like the one I am proposing, as the Arabs never have the same respect for them as they have for English gentlemen, and I am cofident that it is better to employ an officer who can be depended on to enforce respect, even if in some respects he is not so well qualified as a man of interior position. ^ ISS. As regards the additional cost of the proposed appointment, I have the honour to submit, for favourable consideration, a proposition statement showing the yearly in crease which it will entail, together with a statement shewing the initial expenditure which will have to be incurred the first year. . 1 3' As regards the latter, I would observe that it will be necessary to build a suitable residence for our representative, as there are no houses available. While a house is being built, he can remain in tents, as the climate is neither hot nor cold during the winter, but, eventually, he and his office establishment and escort must be properly housed, and 1 do not think the amount 1 have suggested for this purpose is excej-sive. The incumbent will, of course, pay the usual rent assessed on the value of the house the cost of which will not therefore be an actual loss to the Government. 14. A small Guard of Native Infantry for the Political Officer will. I think, be necessary. 1 Havildar. ^ 0ne s ' :ren &amp;^ noted in the margin be , N a ik.

The sum of Rs. 18,000, which I have estimated as required for the building of the house, will, I think, be sufficient for the inclusion of quarters also of the guard. 469.

No,. 47-49. might be made with regard to our political representation at Bahrein, expressed his opinion that our interests would be suffi ciently served by the appointment of an uncovenanted officer. At the same time he reported demi-officially that Mr. Gaskin was doing well at Bahrein, knew what was going on and was getting on well with the Sheikh, who was not an easy man to manage. The Government of India accepted his opinion and agreed to con firm Mr. Gaskin's appointment, subject to the approval of His Majesty s Govern ment, on the understanding that the arrangement would be liable to revision, should it be found to work unsatisfactorily. Colonel Kembell was accordingly asked to submit revised estimates (Government of India letter, No. 1881-E. A., dated 17 th September 1900.) 471.

The Resident had every reason to be satisfied with his conduct of affairs and was of opinion that it was undesirable to appoint an officer of the graded list of the Political Department in place of Mr. Gaskin in view of the in creasing interest in the Gulf, though the Secretary of State was in favour of the proposal. He urged that the appointment of a British subject as Director of the Bahrein Customs was absolutely necessary from the point of view of the Chief 's own interests and of the prosperity of the islands, 474. Lord Curzon noted— I sent Mr. Gaskin originally to Bahrein in face of the strongly expressed opinion of Colonel Meade— vide my notes of 2nd July 1899; *7^ October 1899; 22nd October 1899—because 1 thought that he was the right man. The choice seems to have been justi fied ; and it no more matters whether he is a gazetted officer than whether he wears whis kers. 475- ^e following despatch was issued to the Secretary of State (No. 168 dated Simla, the 24th October 1901.) ' ' .u '^ it , h reference to the correspondence ending with Your Lordship's telegram, dated the 9th july 1901, regarding Bahrein affairs, we have the honour to forward, for the infor mation of His Majesty s Government, copies of the correspondence detailed in the accom panying list. • j. 2 ' 7^ th * P ° litical Resident in the Pers ^ an Gulf that, for the reasons given in his letter, dated the 16th August 1901, it is undesirable to replace Mr. Gaskin the Assistant Poht'cal Agent at Bahrein by an officer of the graded list of the Political Depart- ment. During the period in which he has represented British interests at Bahrein Mr Gaskin has, we consider, justified his selection; and any advantage which might be ex' pected from the appointment of an officer of superior status would, we conceive be out weighed by the extra expense and the constant changes of personnel, which would certainly resu t from such an arrangement. It is true that in February 1900 Mr. Gaskin^s apnoint- ment was sanctioned a.s a purely temporary arrangement, but subsequently in September of the same year it was decided to make the appointment permanent Our arrange menu bT «&gt;nfirmedL 0Ur in our des P a tch, No. 93 of 13th June, and will, w? trust, 475-A.

O'Conor in his despatch dated 6th May 1901, observed that any arrange ments that affirms and strengthens the authority of the Indian Government over Bahrein must be regarded with satisfaction, and that he would welcome the news that a British or British Indian subject had been appointed Director of the Bahrein customs, as such an appointment would seem to the Turks a material proof of our authority ever the island. This proposal was thought by the Secretary of State as well deserving of the early consideration of the Government of India (despatch No. 9, Secret, dated 24th May 1901). 477. Colonel Kemball was, therefore, asked to report on the matter, and to state, if the Sheikh could be induced to undertake the customs reform in consi deration of an advance of money, what sum would be required and on what terms it should be advanced. 478. Colonel Kemball in his letter No. 147, dated 16th August 1901, reported :— 0 The appointment of a British subject as Director of the Bahrein customs would undoubtedly be highly desirable from the point of view of the Chiefs own interests and of the prosperity of the islands. It is from this point of view that I consider the change so desirable, more than on account of the effect which has been suggested of giving the Turks a more material proof of our authority over the islands. Our action with regard to the islands on several previous occasions, and the recent appointment of a Political Officer, coupled with our formal recognition of the Chief's eldest son as his successor, can leave no room for any reasonable doubt in the matter. I do not mean to say that the appoint men of a British subject as Director of the Customs might not have a further useful effect it this direction, but it is, I think, chiefly from the point of view above alluded to by me than the question should be considered '. 479. The Government of India thereupon replied to the Secretary of State Despatch, No. 9, dated 24th May 1901 'In Your Lordship's Secret despatch No. 9, dated the 24th May 1901, you invited our attention to a suggestion made by His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constanti nople that a British or British Indian subject should be appointed Director of the Bahrein Customs in order to give to the Turkish Government a material proof of our authority over the'island. Colonel Kemball, in the letter already quoted, agrees that such an appointment would undoubtedly be to the Sheikh's advantage; but considers that the measures which have already been taken should have no room for misapprehension as to our predominant position in Bahrein. As we stated in our despatch of Qth Mayt, we do not think the position at Bahrein altogether satisfactory, _ and the appointment of a British subiect as Director of Customs would hardly in our opinion, make it mote dehoite. At the same time we recognise thnt our interests would be served by the arrangement suggested bv Sir N O Conor, and, as Your Lordship will observe from the papers that we enclose, the question of obtaining a closer control over the Bahrein Customs has en g a g^ our att ^; tion for some time past. It will be seen from Sir W. Cuningham s letter of 7th February igoq that Colonel Meade was directed to press the proposal on the Chief simultaneously with the convevance to him of the information that we were prepared to recognise his eldest son as his successor. But our hope that the Sheikh would recognise the advantages o the measure suggested was not realised, and Colonel Kemball now reports that the atti tude of the Sheikh in the matter is still unchanged. It is possible that an opportunity may occnr later for reviving the suggestion with more prospect of success, and Colonel Kemball will continue to bear the matter in mind. 480. Colonel Kemball again approached th f Chl &lt;s f on the subject, but without any success. His report No. 201, dated 8th November 1901, may be read ' ' Havin? received a report from the Assistant Political Agent that the Chief was m great finlncfal straits, and intended t o make some change with a yew to augmenting th e [C943FD] * Vide Chapter LVII ante. f Vide paragraph 354 ante. \ 1 ■ 5 i142 income which he at present derives from his Customs, I thought it advisable to proceed to Bahrein for the purpose of interviewing the Chief on the subject of the acceptance by him of a British subject as Director of Bahrein Customs. I regret, however, to say that the Chief declined to entertain the idea and that 1 found it imposbible to overcome his opposition to the proposal by any argument. I pointed out to the Chief that if he accepted my suggestions and agreed to the appointment of a British subject as Director of his Customs, it was possible that the Gov ernment of India would agree to make him a loan of money which would at once clear him from his financial difficulties and at the same time improve his future financial prospects, and place his Customs Administration on a satisfactory footing. I also used i-ther arguments to show him that the fact of his Customs being managed by a British sub ject could not affect the nature of his independence, and that nothing but good could result to him and to his subjects. The Chief admitted the force of my arguments but informed me before I left Bahrein that he had consulted his principal people and that in view of their opposition to the proper sal it was impossible for him to accept it. He informed me that he intended to take over the management of the Customs from the present farmers, who are British Indian subjects, and that he hoped that the increased income which he expected to gain by so doing would relieve him from his financial diffi culties. Whether the Chief will really take over the direct management o( his Customs, I cannot say, but I am inclined to believe that he will first of all try to refarm the Customs for a higher sum, and he has, I am aware, already approached Ruttonsee Purshotum, the British Indian trader at Maskat, with this end in view. I much regret that I have failed to persuade the Chief to accept the proposal to appoint a British subject as Director of his Customs. I was not, I confess, hopeful, know ing the Chief's character as I do, that my efforts to persuade him would succeed, but I was most anxious that he should agree to accept the only arrangement which can, I am convinc ed, place the finances on a satisfactory basis. As it is, so far as 1 can see, his financial position will only go from bad to worse. He has, so far as I am aware, no one in Bahrein sufficiently honest and capable to manage his Customs in a satisfactory manner, while, if he succeeds in refarming the Customs for a higher figure, his relief will, I believe, be only temporary. Nothing further, however, can be done at present'. 481, A fortnight later the Resident reported that the Sheikh had released Secret E., January 1903, No*. 41*49. his eustoms for a further period of two years. The Secretary of Mate was inform ed of this further attempt and failure. 482. Here the matter rested until it was again brought up during His Excel- 0 , - e . » - . lency's recent tour in the Persian Gulf, when Z'ZX iW E • ' ebr,u ' ,r ,904 ' the Sheikh was informed that he must clearly understand that the matter could not be dropped and that the Resident would be instructed to report after consulting the Sheikhs. s No. 72 in Secret E.. May 1904, Mas. 72^74. 4**3- Following the report was then sub mitted by Colonel Kemball (No. 38, dated 18th February 1904)• 2. As the Government of India is aware, the Customs of Bahrein have been given out on lease by the Chief of Bahrein to certain firms of Hindu Baniahs residing at that place. Customs dues were, it is understood, first levied, at Bah^ rein by sheikh Ah bin Khalifa m the year i860. The rate varied, but did not exceed 4 per cent, ad valorem up to 1898, since which date the rate of &lt; per ^nt. has been le^ed. 1 he Customs administration was in the hands of the Chief until 1888, when he leased it out to a Syndicate of Baniahs. On the impo- fLmV' [ 8 f 98 ' as th ® f ' 11 r ^ e of 5 Per cent., the extra rate of 1 per cent, was tarmed out to a second Syndicate of Baniahs. _;3;7 t he Assistant Political Agent reports that for the year 1903 the Chief ,8 ,1 S S - 8&amp; ' 200 on account of tlle 4 per cent share and * ' P er c . ent - share . that is to say, a total sum of Rs. 1,16.200. npr CRtvi- anHi receive an aggregate amount of Rs. 1,17,500 tor the 4 shared Thl . ^ Cem ' sh . ares v and ln '505 he will get Rs. 1,23,200 for the two anm e r J T*'' sl ? are 1 has been ^ased to the original Syndicate for the oer cent sharlvnir 9 ' 30 a f ° r . the I*™ '^ 6 and * he contract for the I per cent, snare expires m April 1906.»43 4. The Assistant Political Agent further reports that in consideration of above leases, the Chief has drawn advances : from the first Syndicate which is represented by Messrs. Gungaram Tikamdass and which holds the lease of four- fifths of the Customs up to 7th January 190% he has received in advance Rs. 1,40,000 on account of the four lunar years from 1st Zil Hijah 1321 to ^oth Zil Kaada 1325 corresponding to the 18th February 1904 to the 7th January 1008. The second Syndicate, which holds the lease of the remaining one-fifth of the Customs up to 25th April 1906. has paid an advance of Rs. 50,000 to the Chief on account of the two lunar years from 1st Rabi-ul-Awal 1322^0 the ^oth Safar 1324, corresponding to the 17th May 1904 to the 25th April 190^. The Chief has also taken a loan of Rs. 22,000 from the two Syndicates proportionately payable next autumn when he proposes, so the Assistant Political Agent reports to extend the leases. The total amount in which the Chief is indebted to the two Syndicates is, so far as is known, Rs. 2,12,000. The two advances men- tioned diminish by Rs. 2 ,916 -10-8 and Rs. 2.083-5-4 respectively each month commencing from the date against which they were paid. 5. Now with regard to the amount which the Chief ought to receive from his Customs, if the farming system were abolished and a competent service estab lished. The Assistant Political Agent reports that for the year 1902 the volume of trade excluding non-dutiable articles, such as pearls and specie, amounted to over 80 lakhs of rupees. Of this it is estimated that 25 per cent, represents the value of goods transhipped on which a duty of 2J per cent- is charged. It will thus be seen that the income of the Customs estimated on the basis of 2} per cent, on 20 lakhs and of 5 per cent, on 60 lakhs, would be r± lakhs. For the five years preceding 1902, the annual average of the trade was over 76 lakhs of rupees excluding non-dutiable articles, and the Annual Customs revenue calculated on the above basis should have been well over 3 lakhs of rupees. It is of course impossible to say exactly what profit the Customs farmers have been in the habit of making, or to forecast with accuracy what income may be expected when a competent Customs administration is established and the farm ing system abolished; but there can be no doubt whatever that under the exist ing system, which of course is by no means an efficient one, the profits of the farmers have been large. The farmers admit that they make a profit of Rs. 50,000 or 60.000 on their contracts with the Chief, but the Assistant Political Agent thinks that they have considerably understated their actual profits and it is only leasonable to believe that such is the case. Estimating the expense of an efficient administration at Rs. 30 000 per annum (I shall refer to this subject later on), it will, I beleive, be found that the net income realisable from the Customs, if the farming system is abolished, will beat least double that which the Chief now receives from the farmers. 6. I do not consider it necessary to discuss in this report the conditions which render it advisable that the existing system of farming the Customs at Bahrein should be abolished, and that an efficient administration controlled by a British or British Indian subiect should be introduced. This matter has been di&gt;&amp;ussed at length in previous official correspondence and is well known to the Government of India. His Excellency the Viceroy during his recent visit to Bahrein spoke to the Chief on the subject and informed him clearly of the views of His Majesty's Government with regard to it. The Chief replied that the matter was a private one which he trusted he might be allowed to manage in his own way. He could give no reason for not desiring the reform and was most obstinate in the matter, and at last said that before he gave a final reply he desired to consult the members of his family on the subject. When I saw the Chief recently at Bahrein he informed me that he had definitely made up his mind, that he and his family did not approve of any change being made, and that he would not consent to any change. I asked him to state his reasons for not desiring a change, which could not but be beneficial to him, as I could hardly report to the Government of India that he had definitely made up his mind with out having some reasons for his decision. He replied that he had no reasons to give : he did not approve of any change and that was sufficient. His attitude is probably due to his ignorant dread that his submission in the matter will mean, or will at least be considered by his subjects and neighbours to144 mean, the end of his independence, and further to his reluctance to abolish a system whereby he can always obtain advances in time of need. However this may be, both my predecessor and 1 have frequently endeavoured to induce the Chief to consent to so desirable and necessary a change in the system of his Cus toms administration, employing of course all the necessary arguments for remov ing any misapprehensions from his mind, but without success ; and knowing the Chief as I do, I am confident that he will not give way. 7. If then it is decided that the existing system of farming out the Customs is to be abolished, notwithstanding the Chief's refusal to consent to any change, it will be necessary to obtain the services of some officials trained in Customs work, as none of the Chief's subjects are capable of managing the business at all efficiently. 1 will proceed now to consider this and other points connected with the change. 8. The first point to be considered is the treatment of the members of the Syndicates who have taken the lease of the Customs. It will be seen from what has been written above that so far as is known these men have made advances to the Chief amounting to Rs. 2,12,000. If the leases are cancelled, it will, I pre sume, be necessary to pay the Syndicates in a lump sum such amount as may be found to be due to them on the date when the farming system is abolished together with such interest as may appear to the Government of India to be reasonable under the circumstances of the case. The Assistant Political Agent reports that the rate of interest usual in Bahrein is high and varies from 25 to 60 per cent, according to the nature of the security given. In the present case the Hindu traders who comprise in the Syndicates have done much towards promot ing the trade of Bahrein and have come forward to help the Chief in his difficul ties, thus preventing him from falling into the hands of undesirable speculators. I find it difficult to say what amount of interest should be allowed to them, but per haps interest at 15 per cent, on the balance due to them by the Chief from the date the advances were made up to the date of their liquidation would be fair. The amount thus paid to the Syndicates for the cancellation of their lease might be treated as a loan to the Chief from the British Government and could be paid off by regular instalments from the Revenue of the Customs with such interest as may be decided upon. The yearly income from the Costoms will be in all pro bability not less than 3 lakhs of rupees, and after paying the Chief a yearly allowance of Rs. 1,80,000, which should be sufficient for his present require ments, the balance remaining should be sufficient to ensure repayment to the Gov ernment of the loan within a reasonable time. 9. Next as regards the staff which will be required, when the management is taken out of the hands of the farmers and conducted by us on behalf of the Chief. There are at present two Customs Houses in the Bahrein islands, one on Manama and the other on Muharrak. Under the existing system, 5 Baniahs are posted in the Manama Customs House with five guards to patrol the wharf; and one Baniah and three guards are stationed at Muharrak. No tally clerks are kept and no proper control is exercised. The Assistant Political Agent has submitted the following proposals of the establishment required for an efficient supervision of the Customs House.

The rest of the establishment can be obtained locally and from Bushire or Busra. I am unable to say how far such an estab lishment will be found to meet the actual requirements, and I would suggest that a trained official might be deputed from India for the purpose of going into the matter carefully and submitting a report. Meanwhile it will, I think, be advisable to warn the Baniahs that they must make no further advances to the Chief and not make any further contracts for the lease of the Customs beyond the periods for which their leases hold good ; and I would solicit the early orders of the Gov ernment of India on this point, as it is probable that the Chief will soon try and extend one or both of the leases. 10. The best time to introduce the change will be during the slack season, that is to say, between May and September. I do not anticipate that any active opposition will be experienced when the new system is introduced, but it will, I think, be advisable that a ship-of-war should be stationed at Bahrein at the time when the change is made and for some little time afterwards. I think, too, that it might be advisable to provide at an early date a small guard of Native Infantry as an escort for the Assistant Political Agent. An escort of 25 men would, 1 think, be suitable. It will be necessary to provide accommodation for this escort, and for this purpose a sum of about Rs. 2,000 will be required. A detailed estimate on this account will be submitted, if the proposal is approved.' 484. The question was then discussed in the Foreign Department, and Notes in Secret E,, May 1904, Nos. 72.74. Lord Curzon noted on 19th March 1904 :— ' I do not consider that we can allow this obstinate old man to hold out. He has been given ample law. He has received substantial favours. He has been warned by me. He has on one occasion at any rate played us false. I am afraid that our failure is lastly attributable to the weakness of Colonel Kemball. It was that officer who foolishly advised us to drop the Custom's question at the time that we were recognising the son. His repeated interviews with the Sheikh are fraught with no consequences : nor indeed is it conceivable that they should have any other result. We shall do nothing at Bahrein until we have different men at Bahrein and Manama. The first thing to do is to appoint a Political Officer an Bahrein. When he is firmly established he must take the Customs question in hand. The Chief will know what it means. The Secretary of State must be addressed. But the despatch must be carefully worded.' • | [C943FD] M146 485. Mr. Russell then prepared a draft despatch to the address of the Sec retary of State, which was issued after being Na amended by Lord Curzon (No. 5, dated 21st April 1904):— ' We have the honour to address you regarding the affairs of Bahrein and the arrange- ments for British representation at Manama. The situation is peculiar. The protection of the British Government has converted the island from a scene of chronic external aggres sion and intestine feud into a peaceful and flourishing centre of industry and commerce. We have not only secured the stability of the present Chief's rule, but at the Sheikh's ^ entreaty and with the approval of His Maiestv's ^ No. 109 in secret E., January 1901, os. 10 - Government, we have recognised his son, Hamed as his heir, and have thus practically guaranteed' the succession on Sheik Isa's death. Yet we have never declared a formal protectorate ; we have demanded no tribute ; and we have abstained from interference in domestic affairs except at the Sheikh's request. Secure in the gratuitous enjoyment of the benefits thus' conferred upon him, the Sheikh has forgotten the past vicissitudes of the Khalifah family and the exactions and the loss of independence to which his ancestors submitted at the hands of the Wahabi House and of the Imam of Maskat during the period immediately preceding our intervention ; while our moderation seems to have induced the belief in the Chief's mind that his relations with the British Government are of kind that involve no cor responding obligations on his own part. 2. The incorrectness of the Sheikh's attitude has been conspicuously noticeable in con nection with the question of his Customs revenues. His Majesty's Government are aware cf the existing system whereby the Customs are farmed to British Indian Banias, and of the inadequacy of the income which is obtained under this arrangement. So far back as 1898 No. 88 in External A., May 1900, N03. 88-107. 0 j 1 ' 1&gt;oll tical Resident m the Persian Gulf broach ed the subject with the Chief, who gave Colonel Meade to understand that he would not renew the lease which had then about fourteen months to run, without first communicating with the Resident Later in the same vear in pursuance of a proposal approved by your predecessor, Colonel Meade visited Bahrein with the object of inducing the Sheikh to receive a qualified officer to manage his Customs Despite the previous understanding, hewever,the lease had in the meanwhile been extended No. 90 Hid. ^ 0r a f u rther period of two years ; and no action was taken beyond an expression by Colonel Meade of his disapproval of the Sheikh's bad faith. Three months' later the Sheikh, though, No 44 in Secret C., April 1900. No. 44. still indisposed to revise his Customs arrange- . . men ts, again promised not to enter into any fresh agreement on the expiry of the existing contract in April 1902, without first informing the Resident. But in January 1900 Colonel Meade reported that the Sheikh had a^ain depart- ed from his engagements, and had prolonged the lease for a fresh term of two years without previous intimation. A remonstrance was made; and the Chief expressed regret; but No. 412 in Secret E., January 1902, Nos. 41-49. nevertheless, when in 1901, at the instance of Sir 386. 0 ' 3^8 in £ecret E '' 0ctober I 9 0, i Nos. 368. ^hould employ a British subject 8 to ^p^vL^ his • u ro- at • ^ r- t &gt;T Customs ' he once n ^re declined to accede to the wishes of His Majesty s Government. In November of the same year, the Sheikh appeared to become more amenable, and declared his intention of assuming the direct management of No. 44 in Secret E., January 1902, Nos. 41-49. lllS ^ expiry of the lease then Clir- ' . f V ' r rent - Within a fortnight, however, he had re- newed the contract for a further period of two years. No further action was taken until during his recent tour in the Persian Gulf, His Excellency the Viceroy spoke seriously about the matter to the Chief and pointed out to him the necessity of a change in the existing Secret E., February 1904, Nos. 33-127. arrangements. The Sheikh asked for time to Serial No. 2, (Current), consider the matter with his brother and sons; aud the Resident was accordingly instructed to report further after renewed consultation with the Sheikh. In his letter of the 18th Feb ruary 1904, of which we enclose a copy. Colonel Kemball has recounted the failure of his further endeavours with Sheikh Isa, who steadily declines to revise the arrano -ements under which his revenues are at present collected. 0 1 3 ' ^ he '^ ed f) for refor ^ 18 clear f I y by the figures given in Colonel Kemball's letter The Chief s present income from his Customs is Rs. 1,16,200 while the revenue which may be expected under an efficient system is estimated at Rs. ^,50,000. The prac ticability of the change is proved by the example of Maskat where, in partial compliance with our wishes, the Sultan has taken the Customs administration under direct manage ment, and has a ready reaped considerable benefit from the arrangement The Te Z JmnnrVnf S !^ w If h ., We ^ ann0t renlain ''^rent. Committed as we are to support of Sheikh Hamed it is incumbent on us to take measures to ensure, that, on his accession, he may find his house in order, and may not be burdened with a heavy legacy of debt accumulated by the improvidence of his predecessor. For this reason we consider that the question l s not one which can be allowed to drop even, if it were' ''Jl I M7 possible to overlook the Sheikh's repeated breaches of faith and his persistently contum- cious attitude w.th regard to it In fact, the reform of the Customs administration of Bahrein has become a test case of the nature and degree of the influence which the British Government may reasonably claim to exercise over the ruler of those islands. 4. To coerce the Sheikh would be a simple matter. He possesses no troops or ships' and the towns of Manama and Muharrak, where the Sheikh himself resides, are completely open to attack uom the sea. But the adoption of forcile measures would be liable to arouse unnecessary suspicion and alarm as to our intentions in the Gulf ; and we prefer, therefore, to effect our object by means which, if slower, may, we trust, be not less effective. During the Viceroys recent visit to the island, His Excellency was impressed with the fact that our Assistant Political Resident at Manama does not carry that weight with the Sheikh which should be expected in the representative of the British Government. That Mr. Gaskin was not entirely suited for the Exierna 1 A . May 19°° Nc, 92. p 0st has been recognised from the outset; No. 372 in Secret E., October 1900, Nos. • i .1 - T j, ^ &amp; tt -i . , ' 386, we think that Lord George Hamilton was right when he expressed the opinion in 1901 that the appointment was one which should be held by an officer of superior status: and we propose, with the approval of His Majesty s Government to select an officer of the graded list of our Political Department to take the place of Mr. Gaskin, for whom we hope to be able to provide elsewhere. To emphasise the change we would send a small guard of native infan try as a permanent escort to our new Agent. It has been recognised as desirable that a gun-boat should visit the island frequently during the pearling season to check the piracies which then occur. During the present year it can probably be arranged that the gun-boat shall make a more prolonged stay at Bahrein. It will also be necessary to provide the Assistant Political Agent with a boat of some description, so that he can at intervals visit Katit and the out-lying portions of his charge, and this boat could, perhaps, be utilised for tbe suppression of piratical outrages in the shallower waters which a British gun-boat cannot reach. In this way we think that the difficult question which has been raised, of allowing the Sheikh to arm and equip a dhow for this purpose, might be satifactorily met, while an additional proof of our title to police the pearl banks would be secured. 5. The Sheikh will probably not be slow to recognise the significance of the action which we suggest, and we anticipate that it will not be long before a suitable officer is able to secure a proper influence over the Sheikh and to find an opportunity of bringing pres sure to bear on him in connection with the Customs question or any other matter. Apart from affairs of domestic interest, the need for a more definite assertion of our position has recently come into greater prominence owing to the establishment of a German trader on the island, and by reason of the growing interest in this quarter displayed by foreigners of other nationalities. We also contemplate that the officer posted at Bahrein should be invested with Vice-Consular powers for the Turkish district of El Hassa, and should be charged with the superintendence of our commercial interests at Katif regarding which we have recently addressed you in a separate despatch 5 iliait! lisreas™ it 0148 CHAPTER LX. Scheme for the construction, by Sheikh of Bahrein, of a pier for the landing and shipping of cargo. 1903—19 o 4. 486. The arrangements for the landing and shipping of cargo at Bahrein External a ., April 1904. No,. 21-27. ^ been ^jtherto of a very primitive character. Mr. Gaskin therefore obtained the Chief's consent to the construction of a pier at a cost estimated at Rs. 30,000. A draft of the terms and schedule of proposed wharfage dues to be levied on all Nos 2I( exports and imports on completion of the pier was submitted to Government in July 1903. The terms on which the Chief of Bahrein will have pier built in &lt;f Manama ' to facilitate the discharging of stea?ners are :— That Chief will build a jetty at a place where the lighters can discharge their cargoes quickly and the jetty will be of sufficient area to accommodate the cargoes that will be imported and reach a point where the lighters can drscharge their cargoes at all times without delay. (2) That the jetty shall be always kept in proper repairs. {3) That arrangement shall be made so that the merchandise vvill not remain on a jetty, and when cargo remains there it shall be protected from rain and theft, etc., and if damaged, it will be paid for, (4) That whaifage dues shall be levied cn all goods imported from any place either in ships of sailing craft, and likewise on tne exports, and goods on which wharfage dues have once been charged shall not pay a second time on re export or re-import. U\ All goods imported into.or exported from any Bahrein port shall pay the ; same dues. (6) The dues shall be paid by all persons without favour, (7) Merchandise not mentioned in the schedule shall pay the same dues as articles of similar class. 487. The Karachi Chamber of Commerce, who were consulted,_ expressed the opinion that the construction of the No - 23 ' proposed pier would tend to improve the commerce of the port of Bahrein. 488. The Government of India sanctioned the project subject to the con dition that the right to levy wharfage dues No - 24 ' should cease, if at any time, the pier should, in the opinion of the Political Agent, become so out of repair, that it could not conveniently be used for the landing and shipping of goods. _ They also directed that clause 3 of the terms should be modified so as to make it clear that it is ior the owners of the goods to remove them from the pier and that ' they are not removed after a certain fixed time—say 24 hours—(1) demurrage will be charged and (2) no liability for loss or damages will devolve upon the Chiet. 480. This 3rd clause of the terms was, however, ultimately ordered to be ^ ^ 0 retained, as proposed by Mr. Gaskin, since No-3i- t he Chief levies certain fees for the use of the ' Amara and the right to levy the fees is farmed out to a person, who also attends to the donkeys employed for removing the cargo and thus takes the re moval entirely out of the control of the merchants. The donkeys, moreover, are frequently requisitioned by the Chief, which causes delay in the removal goods. . . , . 490. The Government of India have at the same time suggested tnat it would be well that a charge should be made at a fixed rate for the use of the ' Amara ' after a specified period, which should be determined by local condi tions i and'so as to allow that, if reasonable diligence is exercised in removing the goods, merchants may be free from the payment of any charge. t c 943 FD ]appendices.&gt;ENI UTBAH.

Preamble. As the arrangement and settlement of the affairs of subjects are entrusted to Kings and their Governors, and the prosperity of the States depends upon the unanimity and friendship existing between Governors of adjoining Provinces, for this purpose, the States of Great Britain and Persia entered into terms of amity and good undeistanding, that the subjects of each and their forces might enjov tranquillity and prosperity, the Governors of Provinces adjacent had maintained this appearance and had rested satisfied without actually fulfilling them. Two years previous to this it became necessary to suppress the piratical acts commit ted by the Joasmis (?) for which purpose troops arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and a few acts were committed by them erroneously which did not accord with the good understanding existing with this State, in consequence of which His Royal Higness Hussein AH Mirza deemed it advisable for the good of his Government to make known these acts of misunderstanding to the Government appertaining nearest to his own that they might be aware of what had occurred, that some explanation might be offered for his Royal Highness to act upon, and for this reason deputed Mirza Bunghir, % Military Secretary, to proceed to Bombay at the time that the Hon'ble Mount Stuart Elphinstone was Governor of it and of its dependencies, and he came to an explanation with the Hon'ble the Governor who showed every wish and inclination to preserve the good understand ing and for which purpose deputed Captain Bruce as the Hon'ble Campaing's Resident to Bushire as the Government Agent. After his arrival. His Royal Highness directed his attendance and on the 8th of August 1822, or 20th Zilkad, I 237 Hijree, at Sheeraz, came to an amicable decision and understanding with Mahomed Zaki Khan, Sirdar and Minister of Fars, the following engage ments being agreed upon :— —That the Vekils of the two States enter into friendly discussions and explanations tending to cement the ties of amity and good understanding between the Governors of the adjacent countries. 2nd. —The Island of Bahrein which has always been subordinate to the Province of Fars and its possessors, the Beni Altabi Arabs who have of late been unruly and disobedient and had applied to the Commanding Officer of the British Forces of a distinguishing Flag. This Flag, if it has been granted, to be withdrawn, and no assistance to be rendered to be Beni Attahi Arabs, here after. 3rd. —That such losses as the inhabitants of Linkay and Charrack may have suffered by mistake in the destruction of their vessels, to be restored in kind, if forthcoming, if not, made good in money by the Government Vekil. 4th. —With regard to Captain Bruce's residing at Bushire, as the Govern ment of Persia had applied for his removal and another officer to be appointed, supposing him to have committed acts contrary to the good understanding be tween the States, which he having cleared up to the satisfaction of his own Gov ernment while Mirza Bunghiewas present, and shown every inclination to forward the interests of the two Sirkars, the Government deemed it advisable to re-no minate him to his former duties, and His Royal Highness, being equally convinc ed, has preferred him being re-appointed to any other officer, and requested it accordingly. 5th. —The British Forces who had taken a position in an Island on the Coast of Persia and who bad been requested to withdraw. As the Hon'ble the [C943FD] OOI 54 Governor of Bombay has expressed a wish for their being allowed to remain for a time for the sake of appearances and benefit derived thereby. In consequence His Royal Highness deemed it advisable for the safety and tranquillity of the Gulf, and to preserve the intercourse free and uninterrupted, has complied for the term of 5 years and until a naval equipment sufficient for the purpose can be gradually collected on the following conditions 75/.—That if previous to the 5 years His Royal Highness should have col lected a Naval Force sufficient to ensure the tranquillity of the Gulf and will pledge himself to that effect, the British Forces to withdraw on the assurance and pledge being given. 2nd. That if the British forces should be considered too great, with a view to economy, they are to be reduced and an equivalent force to be furnished by His Royal Highness under the orders of an officer to encamp on the Island and to attend to their wishes and desires. yyd. The British and Persian forces to take positions on any Island on the Coast of Persia, the climate of which may be found to be the best and which His Royal Highness may nominate and deem advisable. 4^..—Should His Royal Highness during the period the British troops are stationed in the Gulf require the services of one or two Cruizers from the Station to proceed to any of the Islands or Ports of Persia, they are to be furnished, and particularly so on the present occasions when an expedition is in contemplation against Bahrein to reduce it to obedience. His Royal Highness promising after the service may be over to dismiss the vessels with proper honor and respect. Should the vessels be required beyond the period of 40 days, provisions and neces saries to be supplied by His Royal Highness, in failure of which the vessels are at liberty to return. —Such vessels and stores as His Royal Highness may require, to be at liberty to purchase them in any of the ports of India without molestation from the Government, The Vekils of the two Governments who now exchange engagements agree to present them to their respective Governments for their consideration and appro bation, and for the guidance of each other in case of change of Governors.&gt;55 APPENDIX C. {See paragraph 4,) Translation of the Preliminary Treaty with the Sheikhs of Bahrein, 1820.

Preliminary. —Considering the tribe disorders which arise and are per petuated from maritime aggressions in the Persian Gulf, I, Sheikh Mahomed-bin- Khalifa, independent ruler of Bahrein, on my own part and on that of my heirs and successors, in the presence of the Chiefs and elders who are witnesses to this document, do subscribe and agree to a perpetual treaty of peace and friendship with the British Government, having for its subject the advancement of trade and the security of all classes of people navigating or residing upon the coasts of this sea:— Article i. I recognize as valid and in force all former Treaties and Conventions agreed to between the Chiefs of Bahrein and the British Government, either direct or through the mediation of its representatives in this Gulf. Article 2. I agree to abstain from all maritime aggressions of every description from the prosecution of war, piracy, and slavery by sea, so long as 1 receive the support of the British Government in the maintenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of this Gulf. Article 3. In order that the above engagements may be fulfilled I agree to make known all aggressions and depredations which may be designed, or have place at sea, against myself, territories, or subjects, as early as possible, to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, as the arbitrator in such cases, promising that no act of aggression or retaliation shall be committed at sea by Bahreins or in the name of Bahrein, by myself or others under me, on other tribe, without his consent or that of the British Government, if it should be necessary to procure it. And the Bri tish Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury proved to have been inflicted or in course of infliction by sea upon Bahrein, or upon its dependencies in this Gulf. In like manner, I, Sheikh Mahomed-bin-Khalifa, will afford full redress for all maritime offences, which in justice can be charged against my subjects or myself, as the ruler of Bahre.in. Article 4. 1 / British Subjects of every denomination, it is understood, may reside in, and carry on their lawful trade in the territories of Bahrein, their goods being subject only to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent, in cash or in kind. This amount once paid shall not be demanded again on the same goods if exported from Bahrein to other places ; and in respect to the treatment of British subjects and dependants they shall receive the treatment and consideration of the subjects and dependants of the most favoured people. All offences which they may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decision of tne British Resi dent, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily. In like manner the British Resident will use his good offices for the welfare of the subjects of Bahrein in the ports of the maritime Arab tribes of this Gulf in alliance with the British Government.l S7 Article 5.

The pas- sing of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council did not attect the part of that notification which applied to Bahrein and the coast belonging to Arab Chiefs. These powers, therefore, still exist A notification is about to issue, making the newly-appointed Assistant at Bahrein also a First Class Magistrate, within the limits 01 the political district of the Resident. (ii) CiviL There has been nondelegation by Government to any of their officers of civil jurisdiction even with respect to Native Indian subjects. The Resident has been given no civil powers, his First Assistant has none, and with respect to the newly appointed Assist ant at Bahrein the Resident wrote on 26th November 1900 ; '' \. d . 0 thirtk i* necessary at present to give the Assistant rolitical Agent at Bahrein any civil powers [C943FD] QQ162 6 Turning now to ttie Resident's suggestion, we find that he recommends that the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein should ' deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Bahrein Chief It has been shown that the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein has (or rather will have when the notification is published) criminal jurisdiction over Native Indian suiects only. He can be given jurisdiction over other British subjects and over protected foreigners, such as Mr. Wankhaus and his agent, only by the passing of an Order in Council. He has at present no civil jurisdiction over anybody, and it has not been proposed to give him any. It is true that the Governor- General in Council can legislate for Native Indian subjects beyond the Indian territories and that the Assistant Political Agent could be given by the Govern ment of India civil jurisdiction as far as regards Native Indian subjects. But it will need an Order in Council before any civil jurisdiction can be given over other British subjects and over protected persons. The only way, therefore, as things at present stand, in which the Assistant Political Agent could deal with cases of the sort referred to by the Resident, would be the way in which such cases were dealt with in the coast and in the islands belonging to Persia before the Orders , , „ , oc/: in Council concerning them were passed, ^*4^46* n0teS 0f External ' eCem ' 1 ' viz., by the exercise of jurisdiction with- out any express legal warrant and only in virtue of prescription and usage ' a jurisdiction that was described by the Legislative Department as •' very ineffec- tual'. 7 These considerations and the further consideration that, should the '* newly-appointed Assistant Agent at Bahrein Page 3 Of notes Of above. sentence a person to imprisonment, it is only by virtue of an Order in Council that he could be sent to a jail in India to undergo his sentence, point to the advisability of such an order being obtained. &amp; We find, too, that it seems always to have Page 1 of rof «otEx n ieInliV, September 1887, been intended that such an Order should nos. 383-298. be passed as soon as the Persian Coast and Islands Order was disposed of. 8. What we should now do, I think, is this. We should first ask the Legis lative Department to be good enough to \6t us know whether the above view of the legal position in Bahrein and the coast belonging to Arab Chiefs is correct. We should then consider in this Department whether we wish for an Order in Council for Bahrein, and whether we wish that the Order should include the coast belonging to the Arab Chiefs, or exactly what it should include ; and before &amp; deciding this, we should take the opinion of it would, I think, : 'fanuMT the Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Q rder in c ounc ii | we should then again apply to the Legislative Department to help us. q . In referring the question to the Resident, we should also ask him to x? t 1 a consider the advisability of consular powers See Captain Daly s note at page 7, external A., . A ^cicto nt Pnlitirnl May 1900, Nos. 88-107. being given to the Assistant Political Agent. I suppose that the consular powers, if given, would not he given only for Bahrein, but also for the Persian Coast belonging to Arab Chiefs, if it be decided to get an Order in Council for that part of the Gulf, too. ihis also should be considered by the Resident. 10. In asking the Legislative Department at this stage to let us know whether the view of the legal position is correct, we might ask them to advise us what ad interim reply we should give to the Resident's letter, that is to say, to tell us how the Assistant Political Agent should deal with ' mercantile and other cases which may arise between subjects of the Chief of Bahrein and Mr.,\\ ank- haus or his agent at Bahrein ' until the Order in Council is passed. The framing of the Order will, it is to be hoped, not take the excessive length of time that the Persian Coast and Islands Order took, but it will take some time no doubt. T. C. Edwards,—10-2-01. I have nothing to add at present. The Legislative ^ Department J 113 -)' consulted as proposed, I kept back the draft notification in the linked n e, unti I had examined this file ; but the draft notification may now, 1 think, issue. H. D aly,—16-2 -01,163 Mr. Wankhaus Is a foreigner and not a protected person, and I don't see how our Political Assistant, with or without an Order in Council, can claim any jurisdiction in cases which may arise between this German firm and the subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. Mr. Wankhaus will have to take his chance in the Courts of the State. As we have bound the Sheikh not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without our consent, it may be expedient that our representative should, as a matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to Europe an foreigners in disputes between them and the people or Government of Bahrein. But that, I think, is all that we can say. H. S. Barnes,— ao-a-oi. Legislative Department. I need scarcely say that the question here raised is one of extreme difficulty and delicacy. 2. It seems clear that the only reply that can be sent now is that suggested by the Foreign Secretary, and, if the Foreign Department be content to let the matter rest there, this Department will certainly not object. On the contrary, I venture to think that the general question had better not be raised until it is forced upon us. 3. If, however, it be deemed politically expedient to settle the matter now, then it had better be referred to His Majesty's Government. No order that the Governor-General in Council is competent to issue can invest our officers with jurisdiction to interfere in suits between foreigners and subjects of the Bahrein Chief, and, if such jurisdiction can be assumed at all, it can be only through an English Order in Council. Sir A. Scoble was of opinion* that no Order in • See his note of the 4th Septeirber .88; in out Council, nor yet an_ Act of Parliament, nnofficiai Register No. 244 of 1888. could secure such jurisdiction. On the (.8)5). other hand, the Zanzibar Order in Council 1. l. r., 19 Bom., 741. claims jurisdiction over foreigners, and it was held in Bombay f that Greek residents at Zanzibar, having been by interna tional action placed under British protection, were amenable to the British law as administered by our Consular courts there, 4. We hope shortly to have all His Majesty's foreign jurisdiction and pewers with reference to places, such as Bahrein, delegated to the Governor General in Council, and when this is effected, we shall be able to do all that an English Order in Council could do. If we wait till then, we shall have to grapple with the question ourselves, and shall not be able to refer it for disposal to the Secretary of State. But I would not on that occount refer it now. H. W. C. C arnduff,— 2 -3-01. I have read the papers and agree in the above note to which I have nothing to add. J. M. Macpherson,— 21 -3-01. 1 think the answer to the Resident must be as Mr. Barnes proposes. The Zanzibar Order, under which we exercise jurisdiction over foreigners, must be read in connexion with the treaties. European Powers recognise our protectorate, in return for concessions made to them. We could not assume jurisdiction oyer foreigners at Bahrein without asking their respective Governments to recognise a protectorate ; and we might obtain that recognition--on terms. I do not think we need refer to the Secretary of State for instructions. We ought perhaps to report our action, inasmuch as the case bears on the general Question of foreign jurisdiction which we have already referred : but as to this, the Foreign Department will be able to judge.

My note and the Legislative Department's notes on pages 2 and ^ explain the drafts. 0 r / The question seems to turn on whether Bahrein is under our recognised protectorate or not. The preceding office note gives a summary of the corres pondence on this question. The most recent views of the India Office are that No. as, Secret e ., March 1899,^5.27 -31. the Bahrein Chief is already to a con - N * .

' The position seems to be that in a recognised protectorate like Zanzibar we claim jurisdiction over foreigners and exercise it under an Order in Council whether they like it or not. In Bahrein we can hardly claim the same jurisdiction if the foreigner prefers to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Bahrein Courts, and to do so, Mr. Wankhaus is a quarrelsome person, might raise the whole question of our protectorate. But, nevertheless, by virtue of our exclusive position we can and do claim, as against the Chief, to protect all foreigners if we think it is in any case necessary to do so. I have suggested an addition to the draft to this effect. But I think we might also add to the draft despatch something to the effect that our position at Bahrein is unsatisfactory if European merchants take to settling there for purposes of trade, and that it is for consideration whether some steps should not be taken to convert that position into a regular protectorate.
