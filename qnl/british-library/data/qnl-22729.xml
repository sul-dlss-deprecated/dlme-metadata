After Wishes and Respect - I have today been to ^skar 1 village and found that the inhabitants there, our subjects, are in bad need for drinking water - their drinking water is at present being procured from distant and unyielding wells. And, as you are aware, since most of those inhabitants are in the Company's employ, it would be of great convenience to our subjects there if water could be made available for them from the r.eares place in the village, on the sea shore. This would be an act of benevolence, from which the inhabitants will benefit, and which will oblige us, Salams. Seal: Salman bin Hamad A1 Khalifa.Wo«663 . MSMORA.MIXJM 6th April, 1946. MS. R. M.

Please refer to His Highness Shaikh Salman's letter to you dated 24th March, 1946 enquiring into the possibility of deTelopin • a we, uji - a for the inhabitants of the Tillage of Askar. As requested by you we hare gone into this matter vory thoroughly both by an examination of our info mat ion on the hydrology of the Inland and by a Tisit to the Tillage to eheok our geologieal data in that area. Our geologieal data indicates that the Tillage of Askar is located on the outcrop of Bahrein Water Zone 'B« and that the existing hand-dug well is completed in that aquifer. The water produced by this wall is braeiish having a salinity of approximately 8000 ppm CI as HaCl. We hare obtained samples from this well at 4-monthly interrals orer the period of last 5 year? and the salinity has remained approximately constant during that period. The high salinity of this water is in agreement with our interpretation of the hydrology of the Bahrein water bearing formations which shows that the salinity of water increases on both sides of the Island as one goes southward. This* phenomenon is explained by the fact that there is no moTement of under- zround waters around the southern end of the Bahrein structure and the water on the flanks of the structure is Impounded. With no moTement in -ne wt.er P^ ue ^ formatioM the impounded water can be expected to haTe a higher s^lini water in moTement as occurs around the northern end of the Bahrein structure. Under these conditions we are of the opinion that it woul^ be inposRiblo to deTelop a source of potable water by the drilling of an artesian wu m this area. Original Signed By R .

Provision will be made for crossroads or crosspatns by either burying the line or by the construction of ramps ove the line. I will be pleased to go over the proposed route with a representative of the Government at any time convenient to them.

The results of this study indicate that water withdrawal from the resources the Company plans to tap, should not affect the water resources used for gardening purposes by the local populace at the north end of Sitra Island. The Company will be pleased to have the '7. Bahrein Government's approval of this reservation at its earliest convenience in order that the Company may proceed with preliminary work at an early date.

INTHODUCTI ON In February 1941 a proposal vme nada to brliv: water from V^ater -.oil ITo.18, situated off tiie north-aast corner of Sitra Island, to the Refinery, and an application v/ao made to the Bahrein Govamiaent through II.3.- , r,. Politi cal Agont {Ref: Letter No.PA^386 dated February 23, 1041) for a land reservation to cover the necessary pipe line ri ht of way (GR-EO, Parcel r. r o.^5). In reply to this application it was stated by the Bahrain Government {Ref: Mr. 3oleave's letter Ko.74/1360 - Ko«205 dated March 2V, 1941) that a conplaint liad been received from the owners of the gardens in the vicinity of Water Well No.18 to the effect that production of water frora the well adversely influenced the water supply froiu the natural springs which, supplied their gardens and until that iaatter had been investigated the question of the pipe line right of way would be held in abeyance. intensive tests uers carried out in an effort to determine if the Garden Owners' contentions were correct. The results of these tests were never Dresented because the proposal to brin^ water into ^le i^e^inery iro.i .»ater tell No.18 was dropped and the tiuestion of the reservation for the pipe line ri^ht of iray not persued further. Nov/ that it is again proposed to bring water into the Refinery from that area for water treatin,; purposes, it will bo necessary to assure the Bahrein Government that such withdrawal of water by the well completion method we propose will not affect the natural springs. The object of this Memorandum is to present such information we have in support of this contention. s u m ij a 3 y 1 # The regional rlistribution of the ibcene formations in which the water producing horizons are found indicate that in the vicinity of Bahrein the upper («7ater ^one r! ') and lower ( Vater Zone 'B')'' quafere are separated by im iinpervious strata varying in thickness from 30 ft. to 70 ft» Srrosion of the overlying more recent formations is responsible .or the natural springs which derive their water from water Zone 'A'.NUMMARY (Cont'd.) 2. The history of water .itell No. 18 indicates that it is satis factorily completed in ^ater ^one ,, 3 n and that there is no conniunication at the location of the well between rfuter Zone 'A' and .^ater Sone H B', 3. A test in which a dye was pimped into Water Zone '3 H through Water Well No.18 failed to establish comnunication between the vjell and any of the nunerous springs in the vicinity. 4. Intorforence tests conducted over a period of nine days failed to establish any interference between Vmter Jell No.18 and the lor^e natural springs Ain-al-Raha and Ain-al-Muhazza, 5. It is concluded that withdrawal from »'ater Zone T, B n in the vicinity of -ater ..ell No. 18 will not affect the natural springs in that area. V 13 G U^ 0 N GridDLOalG/X The s.irface forriBtions on the northern and southern margins of Bahrein Island are Miocene and more recent deposits; they vary in character from place to place. On the east and west coasts of the Island those formations have been erroded completely and errosion h&lt;-s continued deeply into the underlying Eocene beds. The .Jocene forations, unlike the Miocene and more recent formations, with their variable distribution and character, are uniform in character and can be separated into distinct membero which have a wide reiconal distribution in the vicinity of Bahrein roi on as well as over the coastal rei^ons of eastern ^audi Arabia; these formations have also been identified with normal stratigraphic sequence in our recant operations on Hawar Island. For the purpose of this report the formations in which we are interested are 1. The White Lime (water £one M A n ) 2. Orange J.Iarl 3. Brown Crystalline Limestone (VatQr n B M ) 4. Chalky Zone The Orange liarl is a dense blue-yellow marly clay varying in thickness from 50 ft. to 70 ft, separating: i/ater Zons 'A' from ^ater Sone ^B'. This impervious stratum exists everywhere on the Island at elevation below its outcrop and it is contended that vertical migration between the two main water producing horizons will not take place. Over ^eolocic time and during the process of errosion of the l.iocene ■formations, which overlay the shallow ^ater Zone 'A 1 * horison, weaknesses would be developed, possibly assisted to some extent by the slumping of formations due to anhydrite ht *-! gypsum solution in the underlying Chalky Zone, with theQaOJMJ'ZtL (Oont *4.) reaalt that whon errosion had extericlod to the point et vhich tlie overburden rfeigiit of the Moocae forfiiitions vrcs no longer co ipetant to' hold the hydrostatic r&gt;rei33are of water in .ieter ^loAe 'A', failure ocourr&lt;5u# Tliis is the origin of ti?© ua^eroua natural spria,;;i&gt; on the Island pad on the sea bed around tho aorthersi ea4 of the Island.

ITothing definit® can be concluded as a result of bhis tost b t, as previously pointed out, had the d/e boan detected in any of the surrounding springs evidonce of comuni- cation \70uld have been conclusive. Hji'jjx- ic 'i** 1 In cooperation vdth the owners of the gardens in*the iraiea.i'.-e r iciiii'cy of Ain-al-Raha and Ain-al-ifchazza a series of interference tests were undertaken in an effort to observe the effect of flowing Jater well lIo,18 on the rate of flow or water level of those natural springs. The main outlets of the sprincs were provided with velocity meters and means to maintain a constant cross sectional aroa in order to compute the rate of flow. Bench marks were established from which the level of the water in e;ich spring could be moasuroQ* The static Heac in uh3 j. ouuc- horizons is subject to tidal influence and it was therefore necessary to observe the state of the tide during the period of tho test. This was done at iUtra T-ier where a bench mark was established for such neasurenents. Actual observations were started on August 11, 1941, with .»ater ^ell No.18 shut in. Sinultaneous hourly observations of rate of 'lov/ ^-o' the two springs, water level in the tv/o springs, static head of water -.ell -Jo,13 and the state of the tide were iruide for a period of three days. T ' io data observed for Ain-al-Raha are plotted on the attached Graph (OraphNo.l). It will be observed tliat the tidal influence combined with the erratic manner in which water is used for irrication purposes makes interpretation of these results almost impossible unless only those data observed at constant tide level is considered. Data were therefore extracted from the ^raph -o.i at tide levels of 35', 40', 45 M and 50' below the bench mark on oitra Pier and tho mean lines drawn through the points so plotted ai-e reproduced as the strai^iit lines on Graph ilc.^ attached.

If the flow of water from tfater Well No. 18 had any effect on the water level or rate of flow from the natural springs then the converse would also be true (i.o, flow froni the natural springs would show interference in ./ater V/ell !;o.l r :), but, although the rate of flow for Ain-al-Raha varied between 50,000 and 70,000 bbls./day durina the tine :/ator Well No..18 was shut in, there'is no indication that these changes in flow rate had any influence on the static head of Water Well No.18. It is significant to note fron Graph No.l that the water level in Ain-al-Raha dropped considerably durine the time V/eter iell No. 10 was flowing but this r .vas caused by increased withdrawal fron the sprin.:- itself. The water level, without taking into account the rate of flow is not, in itself, significant and this fuct was evidently overlooked by the owners of the gardens who cooperated in this test and, incidently, ccntrolled the rate of withdrawal. These tests indicate that if interference between tfater Well No.18 and the natural springs does exist, such interference was not reveeled. L 2 $ 1SLE Although the data presented in this discussion do not constitute definite proof that withdrawal froia Water Zone 'D' in the vicinity of Water Well No.18 will not influence the natural springs in the ixnmodiate vicinity which have imter Zone n A H as their source, they are unanimous in indicating that comaunication between the two sources of water does not exist i.e. theoretical considerations indicate that conraunication does not exist and physical tests have failed to ciisprove the theoretical considerations. rc/lrn.

Reference your letter Mo T O: C/393 9 yj dated 4th October, 1947. 1 am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter but the matter has been the subject of a public petition to His Highness from owners of gardens in bitra Island who are seriously alarmed at what they regard as a danger to the water supplies which irrigate their gardens. In several villages in Bahrain valuable gardens have entirely perished owing to the natural springs having become dry. It is believed, though whether rightly or wrongly 1 am unable to Judge, that the sinking of artesian wells in these areas has been the cause of natural springs ceasing to produce the water needed for the date gardens• Examples of this can be seen at Farsia at Keerzakkan and at other places. For years the Bahrain Government has been doing its utmost to restrict the drilling of new artesian wells and apart from isolated cases no permission has been given by the Government for drilling of new wells for a consider able time. Innumerable applications have been made and are constantly renewed. These facts incline His Highness to be very chary over allowing new wells to be sunk near cultivated areas, if Bapco were allowed to drill wells near the bitra gardens, which are among the best in Bahrain, and it was believed by the people that the natural water supply was diminishing the Governments action would cause very adverse comment. His Highness^ first reaction to the proposed new wells was allow them to be drilled only on condition that the Company guaranteed to make good any damage which might be sustained by the owners of the gardens should there be a subsequent loss of water from the springs„ His Highness thinks that it would be impossible to convince the people of bitra that the companyS tests are conclusive proofs that their own water will not be affected. After giving the matter much thought His Highness wishes me to inform the Company that he would like them to drill for water in some other place, not near the bitra gardens, for example in the neighbourhood of the bitra bridge. i have the honour to be, bir, Your most obedient servant.

It is believed, whether rightly or wrongly, that the sinking of artesian wells in tiitra has caused the drying up of the natural springs used for watering the date gardens, and the Bahrain Government have refused permission for the drilling of new wells in Sitra for many years. They are therefore unwilling to incur the adverse comment which their sanction of your scheme would receive if the people of Bahrain were led to believe that the scheme lias caused a diminution of the natural water supply in ^itra, where some of the best date gardens in Bahrain are situated. 3.

Dear Sir: GOVERNMENT RESERVATION The Bahrein Petroleun Company Limited desires to make appli cation for a reservation of uncultivated and tide water land in the vicinity of the village of Jasra. Attached hereto are seven copies each of Drawing BRB-5045 and description showing and describing the proposed reservation which will be known as GR/23, An adequate supply of well water from a reliable source is essential to maintaining present and proposed increased refinery oper ations. The Company's present wells are of insufficient capacity to meet the current demand which will become more acute with proposed in creased refinery operations. To alleviate this condition, the Com pany requests the reservation in question for the purpose of drilling additional wells to meet the demand. This proposal is an alternative to one put forward by the Company for reservation GR/20 on Sitra Island, (refer to our letter C/PA-305 dated 27th September, 1947), which re quest is now withdrawn in favour of this proposal as a result of the request by the Bahrein Government to the effect that it would prefer the Company to drill for water in some location other than near the Sitra Gardens. The Company plans, in the proposed reservation, to drill two water wells, install pumping facilities, erect attendant quarters and lay pipe lines to run into Reservation GR/22 and thence to the Refinery. In the choice of this area, the Company has endeavoured to select 'open' land only and to avoid fish traps and cultivated areas. Also, the Company have selected an area for the drilling of additional wells, tne location of which would provide them a water supply from a source, in quantities within the limits of their anticipated requirements, that would not in their opinion adversely affect the water supply of the local populace. The Company's Geologists and other technicians are in agreement with this opinion. The/ Confideiitia'. bah t&gt; m' r r2—pa-24. May Uy 19AS.

GOVERNMENT RESERVATION GR/2^ C S $ Dear Sir, Please refer to your Confidential Letter No. CL-176, dated 4th November, I948. His Highness*s suggestion that the static head of water in the existing wells in the vicinity of Government Reservation GR/23 be recorded, is an excellent one and one with which the Company is in complete accord* As you probably know, certain water wells throughout the Island have been selected for static head observation and the Company carries out a survey of these wells once every three months. Anticipating the necessity of such records as His Highness suggests, two additional wells in the Budeya - Jasra area were added to this list several months ago and it is now planned to include the water well which is now drilling at Garijah, upon its completion, in this list for routine observation. In this connection, the Company wishes me to point out that the location of Government Reservation GR/23 for the purpose of developing an adequate water supply for essential refinery operations was made on the basis that it was situated in an uncultivated area (please refer to my letter No.PA-24, dated May 4th, 1948j7 With the drilling of the new well at Garijah, the Company is apprehensive that this may foretell the intensive development of cultivation in the vicinity of Government Reservation GR/23 and wish me to point out that any such development, with the accompanying unrestricted flow of water would be far more likely to cause a reduction in the static head in the area under discussion than the withdrawal contemplated by the Company.

His Highness^ engineer went to Girayah with* the geologist. The engineer states that the geologist suggested a site where water could be obtained and told him that a letter would be written to the Bahrain Government. 2. On November 10th I wrote to the Chief Local Representative asking if he could supply the piping for the well. His Higfrness was anxious to get the matter dealt with and as there was no reply to this letter I wrote again on 17th November enquiring about the piping. 3. In the meantime His Highness^ engineer had been told by Mr. Wiid that water could be obtained on a certain site. He reported this to His Highness who gave orders to the engineer that he should start dril- ■ c- t ^ ling. Work was begun on 15th November. . 4. On receiving the Company^ letter dated 17th November I immediately informed His Highness, I was not then aware that His Highness had given orders 2/— r r ■ atial. Out. * j/- 2 - for the work to be begun. His Highness wrote a letter in reply, of which I enclose a copy. 5, The purpose of the well, which is being drilled for His Highness himself, is to water two areas of land one of which His Highness gifted to his second son, Khalifah, and the other which belongs to Rashid bin Nasr because he considered that toe had been hardly treated over a court case and the provision of water for his land was in the nature of compensation. 6. For many years I have been doing my best to dissudde His Highness from giving permission for the indiscriminate drilling of wells. Scores of applications for permission to drill wells are filed in this office. For some years no permission to drill new wells was granted but recently His Highness has allowed several of his own relations to sink artesian wells for the purpose of cultivating open ground. At a recent meeting of merchants His Highness was asked to raise the ban on drilling wells, he replied that he was 'to do so provided that the wells were properly used and were drilled in places where they would do no damage to neighbouring water supplies. This discussion took place before I had explained to His Highness the gist of the Bapco report on the Bahrain water supply, 'Translation of letter No.97/1368 dated 24th Muharram 1368, from His Highness Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad, Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. I received your letter of 19th Muharram, about the artesian well in the land gifted to Rashid bin Naser in G-araiyah and the reply of the Company's geologist about it; The artesian well will be jointly owned by our son Khalifah bin Sulman bin Hamad and Rashid bin Naser and we gifted to him the land north of the land of Rashid bin Naser. It is necessary to fix a valve to control the water. Regarding para 2, re: drilling wells.

Dear Belgrave, You will remember that, in our discussion the other day with Russell Brown, we both mentioned H .H.'s idea about having a Committee to deal with the water conservation problem on the island. You thought he only had in mind a Committee of merchants, which, I agree, would not be effective; I thought he said that there should be 'experts' on it. My own idea is that it should have a representative, preferably a geologist, from the Oil Company, and from the merchants, agriculturists, and, of course, from the Bahrain Government; perhaps H.H. would like to preside over it. I think it should be effective, not merely consultative, and as a first step towards making it so I think H.H. might be asked to pass an Ahlan making it necessary for the Committee's consent to be obtained to sinking any new well. ^111 you take up this proposal with His Highness or shall I? It seems to me that we might now get something done about the old water-wasting bugbear. Yours sincerely. i .D. Belgrave, Esquire, CBE, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, — ? BAHRAIN.10 /z?

No.?-*- / ' 7 ' Advlserate, January 18, 1949 4,^ ' Regarding your S#0» No. C/L-24 dated lOth January, 1949, about water conservation. Last week His Highness had a long talk with Godfrey about the whole problem, especially regarding the Garayah area. On this particular matter he asked for a letter from the Company which should state that they did not consider it likely that the wells which they propose to drill would cause a reduction in the water in the gardens to the north of the Company^ wells. He explained that the gardens to the south of this area, near Jesra, belonged to him so he was not making stipu lations about them. These gardens are fed from natural springs ^n the high ground inland and from some artesian wells. He further asked that the Company should measure the water head in the wells supplying the gardens and also state in their letter that if in the future the head of water decreased the Company would be prepared to discuss the matter with the owners. His Highness assured G-odfrey that he would not allow any more wells to be sunk in this area, I have written to His Highness suggesting that Hussain Yateen^s application for permission to drill here should be refused. 2. Discussing the matter in a more general way His Highness said that he was particularly interested in two water problems, one was the qu4stion of drilling wells in places where old established gardens are dying from lack of water, for example in the Burri area whose gardens iAg used to be flourish/and are now perishing, secondly the possibility of obtaining water in order to cultivate large areas of new land such as the area south of Zellaa Confidential.between the hills and the sea. There was a discussion about the possibility of using water, by pumping, after it had irrigated land. His Highness agreed that the water could be used again but said that owners of wells would not favour the scheme. His Highness then spoke of setting up a committee which would examine all appli cations for permission to drill wells. He said that he would like Mr. G-odfrey and one other technical man from the Company to be members of the committee. He would, I think, be prepared to preside over the committee him self. Later he discussed with me who among his own people should be on the committee. He considered that Mansoor al Araydh, a landowner and a man with extremely broad views would be suitable and also Abdul Aziz al Gosaibi who he considers to be rather less self interested that the general run of local merchants. Godfrey said that he thought that Russell Brown would give his approval of his being on this committee. His Highness also said that he would enforce recommendations of the committee which aimed at preventing wastage of water even to the extent of closing wells. He referred to the well at u-alali which had been closed by the Government some years ago, from a public health point of view. At the same time His Highness stated that he was willing to close down a number of wells on his own property north of Zellaq, these wells, he said, now had scarcely any flow and were probably leaking underground. 3. I consider that the result of the meeting was satisfactory. A committee on the lines which were discussed would be valuable and, I think, effective. His Highness^ own relations have in the past obtained 3/-- 3 - 9% permission to drill more wells than other members of the community and in many cases they have made money by parting with permits to drill to local landlords, at considerable profit to themselves. Often it has been difficult for His Highness to refuse to grant his family permission to drill wells. The committee would be more or less impartial over cases when the applicants belonged to the Ruling Family and its expert opinion would not be influenced by personalities. His Highness does not like refusing to help his own relations in this matter but with the committee behind him he could easily turn down applications from the family. This I believe is one of the reasons why His Highness welcomes the scheme of appointing the committee. 4. Perhaps you would care to send a copy of this letter to the Chief Local Representative for Godfrey^ information. C. J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain.S.O.N o .CA-36.

Shaikh Sulman^ Secretary Raschid and Yosuf Engineer, paid a visit to H.H^s Garden at Subiliyat to examine some water wells that had fallen into disuse. Three wells were visited, all similarly completed with 6' casing terminating flush with or a little below the surrounding ground- level, In each case water was standing within two or throe inches below the top of the casir^g, Raschid said that the sarne condition prevailed in one of the wells in the nearby garden at Shakhrakan, He said Shaikh Sulman was atxious to know whether these wells could be pumped, and if rot what should be done about them, Yosuf Engineer informed the writer that these wells had been drilled about 15 years ago and that no cement had been used in setting the casing. The writer told Raschid that the Company would advise H # H, Shaikh Sulman in writing. On February 12 a level survey was run between the above wells to find whether the water in these wells was stardirg at the same level, and if so, whether this level was normal for the static heed of this area. I egative results would indicate unsatisfactory conditions in the wells themselves. The water was found to stand at the sane level in the different wells (less than 0,1 ft. difference) and the static head was found to be 15,2 ft., which is normal for the area. This showed that there was nothing wrong with the completion of the wells and that their condition merely reflected the existing cordition of the local static head. In view of the age of these wells and the mar ner in which they had beer completed, the writer thinks it inadvisable to have pumps installed on any of them. Especially as certain flowing wells situated at a lower elevation in the same garden would certainly suffer as a result. Instead it is recomr^ended that all these wells be filled to surface with cement. If more water is required than is available at present, it is suggested that a pump be used to recirculate used water that now flows into the sea.

This procedure should have the effect of raising the water table in Water Zone H A n in the imediate vicinity and improving:, to some extent, the drainage to the existing hand-dug wells which are row being pumped to supply irrigation water.

Dear Sir, Pleaae refer to your letter Ho,2051-19 of 1368, dated June Hth, 1949, in connection with the recently drilled mter veil at 0m al Hassan. The rate of flow from this well (in excess of 50,000 Imp. pals./day) as reported in the attachiaent to ay latter 2 .0 .344 da^ed May 26th, 1949, is sufficient to supply the domestic requireniei ts of a cofflinur.ity of over 1,000 people ty Koropean standards. In view of the fact that this well vas approved ty ^ Bahrein Water Goimnlttee to supply the donostic requirenerts of t ^ snail vlfOage of Om al Hassam and particular stress was laid on the fact that no other use would be made of the water, the supply ^.s considered adequate for the purpose for which tlie well was drilled. The well was completed with full penetration of Water Zone 'A' and any deepening to obtain increased flow will necessitate the penetration of Water Zone 'B'. A single sone completion is most desirable from the point of view of water conservation and it is strongly recomraanded that no deepening of the well be undertaken. The rate of flow from the well may be increased by either acidation or by shooting with dynamite. I suggest that you discuss be possibility of this procedure with Mr. R. Godfrey at the next ator Committee meeting. lours very truly. riAi VJ - rl ' CD BY • E 'OW/V Ej CHIEF LOCAL REPRESEKTATI7B THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPAKI LIMITED CCt H.B.M.'s Political Agent, Balirein.(T) I' ^ A v a 1 P.W36J# July 7# 19^9# WA?^ i?ay^SS ^ RATfA* The Advlsorato MttREIW.

The Adviser to the Bahrein Government, The Adviser*te T matlftrail t Dear Sir, i ( V&gt; J mff yg. I wish to aoknovledge receipt of your letter Ho, 2839-19 of 1366 dated October 1, 1949 enclosing two letters Aram owners of gardens in Janabia. As requested, these two letters are returned herewith. In my letter Ho. FA-233 dated January 15th, 1949 1 gave assurance that the Company would observe the static head of water in the area surrounding the Company' a Reservation ((21/23) for the purpose of determining the effect of withdrawal of watei; from the Company water wells, on the water supply in the surrounding area. This has been done* In addition, the Compeny has drilled a well within the Reservation solely for the purpose of observing the static head in the vicinity of the Company water wells. The static head of water in this observation well is recorded continuously and the records go back for several months before the withdrawal of water from the Company wells was started. The pumping of water to the Refinery was started on September 17th, 1949, and the observation well data shows no reduction of static head as a result of this withdrawal. On the contrary, therewu a slight increase during the week limaedlately following the commencement of withdrawal. This increase followed a general decline of head (observed during the time that no withdrawal was made) and is attributed to the seasonal change in static head which was discussed by Mr. R. Godfrey with the Bahrein Water Coomittee at the last committee meeting. September is the month when the lowest static heads are observed, and the current increase is in line with previous observations of seasonal changes. In view of the foregoing, it is contended that the attached complaints, made less than a week after the ccmmencement of Company2 FA 1)6 9th October, 1949 withdrawal of wator in the area, are without foundation. I would like to point out here that the object of the pu &amp;ips at the Company wells is to delirer the water to the Refinery and not to pull the water from the wells; the quantity of water poaped to the Refinery is less than would be produced by one artesian well supplying a garden in this area. The Company records of static Imd are open for examination at any tine and if it would be convenient to sake an appointment for this purpose, I would be glad to have the original records taken to His Highness for his perusal. This could be followed by periodical reports in any form His Highness considers most convenient. lours very truly, QgifiitiAL SIGHBObBV Ffe M. BROWN. R. M.

We informed Your Highness before regarding Bapoo wells. All my property has suffered great damage from these wells. Now I request Your Highness to order the Committee to inspect my property and report the matter to you. Hassan bin Mohamed Doseri.^DHAMED SHARIF SHUKBOLLA BASTAKI BAHREIN. His Highness Shaikh Sulraan Alkhalifah, September 2Dth, 1949. I beg to state to you that the artesian well of 1117 garden Janabieh stopped suddenly because Bapco have put water pumps on their artesian wells. If the Company continue using these water pumps all water in my artesian well will deteriorate and I will suffer great loss. I hope that you will kindly look into the matter. Mohamed Sharif b. Haj Badulrehman Shokrulla Bastaki '• g - The pamplng of water fron the water wells located in the Compeay's Reservation to the south of Budaiya was started on September 17th, 1949, and complaint0 were imrrjediately receired from the owners of gardens in Janabia that this was affecting their water supply. To show that this is not the case 1 attach a graph of the inforiaation obtained from the Observation *fcll in the Company's aeserration, and it will be observed that from March 30th f 1949 up to September 17th, 1949 a reduction in static head amountiag to 6' was observed. This reduction in static heed is the normal seasonal variation which has been discussed at previous meetings, and it will be observed that since that tine the static head has a^ain started to rise, le must continue to watch this static bead ovsr the period of the next year before it can be stated that any harmflil effect is being caused by withdrawal from the Compeny water wells, but I wish to assure the Ooraaittee that any reduction in static head will be araall. r, *inal Signed By R- oodfrev R.'

The local oontract price is estimated between Rs.15 and Rs,20 per foot of depth, including materials, or a total of say U50 for the well. However, the only drilling machine available for artesian well drilling on the Island at the present time belongs to His Highness Shaikh Sulrran, and this machine is not capable of drilling a well to Water Zone 'B' and running casing to exclude Water Zone 'A', As an alternative to the Water Zone 'B' well indicated by your letter, you may wish to consider a Water Zone 'A' well completed at a depth of approximately 250 feet with 6' casing cemented at approximately 90 feet. Such a well is within the capacity of the available drilling machine and would have flow characteristics similar to the well at present near the Ward Room swimming pool at Jufair, It would be necessary, of oourse, for you to make arrangement* to use His Highness' machine, and it is estimated that the cost would be approximately as indicated above (Rs,15 to Rs,2D per foot), I must apologise for our inability to be more specific in reply to your query but I trust that the foregoing will be sufficient for your presnnt needs. The situation may change in the oourse of the next few years, and when the necessity to drill the well under discussion arises, you will undoubtedly be able to obtain more concrete information. lours very truly, THE BAHREIN PETROUEUM OOMFAHT LIMITED First Secretary, Political Residency, Jufair, Bahrein.I c/i-l CiJ A no . of 1369 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 12th R/Thani 1369 February 1, 1950, H.

A report on this matter has been obtained from the Officer-in- Charge, Public Works Department.

Dear Sir f Please refer to your letter No # 428—19 of 1370 dated 2€th November, 1950 # The Producing Department has again reviewed the possibility of repairing the artesian well belonging to Salnan bin i la tar at Raiya, Muharraq, but with the equipment available the success of any repair program which can be devised is extremely doubtful. The only practical method would be to run a smaller pipe inside the present casing to a point below the casing shoe and attempt to cement that pipe in place. This will necessitate the drilling out of coront inside the smaller pipe and no drilling tools are available for this purpose. Attempts have been made to devise other methods of repair which would eliminate the necessity of drilling inside the small pipe but the uncertainty of making a successful repair does not warrant the riatc involved; if unsuccessful the subsequent abandonment of the wel ' be more difficult and the overall cost more expensive than the drilling of a new one. It is understood that the owner's objection to plugging bad- his artesian well and replacement by a new one, is that the new one a/ not be so prolific. This fear is ungrounded and it is also pointed out that any successful repair to the existing well will involve the running of a small pipe and a subsequent drastic reduction in voter production. It is, therefore, recommended that the existing well be abandoned by plugging and a new\ell drilled in its place. The cost of the replacement well will be approximately the same as t,ie well nlleu xor /tun b —FA-599 12th December, 1950 Shaikha Hailah bint Hamad A1 Khallfah at Samahij, Muharraq, in January, 1950, and the cost of abandoning the old well is estimated at Rs # A00 for the materials pins 2 to 3 days work by drilling crew.
