Prom To Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Loch,I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSH IRE. Sir, I have .he honour to inform you that I have succeeded, after considerable difficulty, in getting an house for the Assistant Political Agent for a rental of Rs.1,620/- a year, it is not over good and is, of course, in local style, but it is the best that I have been able to find. 2. The owner was not willing to let the house for less than one year, as it will cost him some Rs.400 to Rs.600 to fit it with lights and fans and to do the necessary repairs , n . the and cleaning. He has asked to be paid/cost of repairs and the electrical installation in advance, I have had to'accept this, as he has no money. 3. Before settling on this house, I saw a number of others, but all were in a bad state of repair or otherwise unsuitable. Some idea of the rents paid here may be had from the lact that a rental of Rs.350 a month from the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited was refused by the owner of the house near the Agency, which I pointed out to you. It proved, however, in any case to be too unfinished to be suitable. 4. The rent of the present house is, therefore, reasonable j. and it isirl?. No. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th April 1934. % ■ TO The State Engineer, Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN . Memorandum. Reference my memorandum No.52S dated the 29th March 1934.

I have indicated where the kitchen might conveniently be placed. 3, Cne site is near the Shaikhs Palace close to the sea shore and here a nearby artesian well can be tapped. The drawing with the inner courtyard is for this site. Ihe second site is at Jufair and the other drawing is for this site. The Superintendent of the Land Registration Department of the ✓Govt of Bahrain can point out the two sites. ^ “N These are only lo to 15 minuted from the Agency by car and tney have the advantage of being very much drier. There is good soil round them. The second site would probably need a tube well. 4. I would suggest that the building should be done by local would suggest that the walls be at least twe feet thick and that an air carpenters, I. wouldsuggest the «.dilitifn ef w*»#en shutters tutsiiJe f®r i^t#rs and windows on the Indian model. Yerkndkhs on the south and west side should be at least 12 feet in width. 5. I would suggest ths-t dressing tables and sideboards should be built into the walls Ibsk below windows and that no space should be left between them and the floor. Wooden supports should be fixed to the wails and the boards of the dressing tables and sideboards nailed to them so that xkKyxdnxRFtxxnXHx the boards do not actually touch the walls Lt is much better te paint the inside and the outside ef all cupboards as fish insects dislike paint intensely,. I have attached some rough plans Aimeiras should be built into the walls in the same way. A room is much cooler xx and cleaner for net having heavy pieces of furniture inside it. These cupboards should be made of the local substitute far teak and should be made by Indian carpenters. 6 . As for the other furniture if a lot has to be bought it would probably be far mere satisfactory for designs to be sent to a good furniture maker in India and to have him use teak wood. Though it might be cheaper for furniture to be imported direct from TJn^lard. Yuch of the fu miti&lt;re I saw at the Idea.l Homes ITxhibitifn in April 19?4 was very suitable a.nd lery cheap, T T o ledges and nichos for dust, neat and strong, have attached some catalogues, ' 7, Ihe pantry should be fitted with a sink and with wall cujpboards and shelves. It would be far more comfortable if all bathrooms were fitted, with water closets and with proper baths and wash basins. Local tiles would make £ good bathroom floors, I^would suggest porous gutch rather than cement floors for other rooms* with coir or reed matting under the carpets. Wood floors would be too expensive. There should be a bitumous layer above the x foundations. Distemper on walls attracts fish insects. Panelling would be expensive and I think would muke r..mE t.. &lt;«*.

Dear Llr.Faruk, The nee poat of a permanent Assistant Political A^ent has been createa nere f ana et present there is no suitable house for him. four house behina the Agency could be made suitable if certain repairs could be effected ana electric light installed, whether you lease the house or not the former #ill n&amp;ve to v be aone to prevent the house falling down. Ths only extra requirements are two European bathrooms and electric light, which I assume should you ever wish to reoccupy the house you would have aone. I shoula be most obliged to you if you couiu see your way to leasing tue house to the Agency ana effecting the above repairs and additions. The most I can offer you at present is a three year lease at Hs.150/- per mensem, which I understand through your agent you are not prepared to accept unless the tenant bears the cost of improvements mentioned above. The latter suggestion I neeu hardly point out is in no part of the world a practical proposition nor fair to the tenant. I shoula inerefore be most greteful if you would verify the above to me by Airmail, we should prefer your hou^e to any other in Bahrain, but cannot make a better offer than the above. Having seen your house recently I assure you that in any case unless you are prepared to repair it, it *ill soon be little better than a ruin ana ^uite uninuaoitable. From that point of view my offer is to your advantage. To I am writing to ray friena Mr. J. G. Laithwaite at the India Office about this affair and he will f think assure on behalf of GBlonel Fowls the Honourable the Political Resident ana myself that if you o&amp;n see your way to accent M.

Faruk is a rich pearl mercnant who has built a large house behind the ‘Agency in which he has never lived, and which we should like to rent for the Assistant Political Agent. He has consistently refused very good sS^rtrs but we feel that the personal touch would over-come the difficulty. Could you please help us to this extent. Yours j To J. G.

I ought, however, to say that we did, in fact, feel some little diffidence in coming in, as we did not know the local conditions, and it was felt xiere that there was some awkwardness about the India Office making a direct approach to Faruk ana so exposing the Secretary of state to the possibility of s rebuff if he said either that he did not wish to discuss the matter at all or that he was not prepared to consider any offer other than that which he has already put forward ana which has been rejected, and the view taken was that it would be difficult to Captain G-.A.

I understand that your most important requirement is the beds.

I I wish to augment the oresent inadeouate furniture at the Fort by certain additions and the articles on the list are all ones which will be required therefore I shoiild be obliged if you would return them before you go to India as Steeled family will arrive before you return. Yours sincerely, Adviser, Government of BahrainPersonal The Residency, Bushire, the 15th nugust, 1935 My dear Cole, Will you please rei 6th paragraph of your personal letter of the 5th August 1935 and let me have a list showing what furniture you have got and what you propose to get with the prices* I will then certainly consider some assistance to complete what Colonel Fowle's Rs*1000/- cannot meet. What arrangements are you proposing for repaying the outlay ? 2. I have given up the idea of getting new sofas for the Agency, hut should he so grateful if you would take with you the two large sofas in the drawing room when you go on recess to Karachi and get a furniture firm to put them into good order. Would you kindly have the cretonne covers taken off and take them separately to Karachi, and instruct the firm that the repairs must he so carried out that the existing covers will still fit the sofas properly. I think that the Slow Mail will gladly take these down as 'favoured' 1 for you. 3, A small point. I meant to ask you when I handed over, hut forgot, not to have either of the two 'Heal* heds (private property) in ilo.l room used o 11 roof. I do not know whether they have been up there, hut if so would you please have them put hack before you go on recess and ask Metcalfe not to take them up again.

The its.1000/- granted by Colonel Fowle far from covers immediate needs. As I am anticipating leave I am keeping expenditure down but I should much appreciate some assistance to complete what Colonel ^owle T s Hs.lQOO/- cannot meet. Incidentially Belgrave required the return of all the furniture he loaned the Assistant Political Agent.- r * /1 m eraoaal. IStJa August lAAib. W My dear Colonel, ylbuld you pierse reler t&lt;&amp; tno first para^iaph oi your perscaa&amp;l Letter dated 15th August 1935♦ As already pointed out /forth*s furniture is Taiued at i^#720/- and this I h ve asked Bazalgetie to send him direct. That leaves i^2G0/- lor further additions and improvements. I have an exact account of all monies spent, and think I caa keep within the . ♦J60/- allowed me. In view of my short remaining period in Bahrain it is not worth while spending money. I hive however made improvements with, curtains, Liberty's Linen, Lasp Shades etcetera which represent a good deal of our private mo ^oy, and which have much im roved the ^xole appearance of the house, and I don't think my wile would agree to leaving these things behind without their value being made good. I have spent i .300/- over pnd above the ,-.1,000/- promisod by Ooloaol .ov/le on a Befrigerator. It is a real necessity. I have debited the cost temporarily to Local funds* I think it would be easier to await your return to Bahrain and then for me to show you the house when you have a free moment and discuss details ;~nd accounts. I assume that Colonel lowle does not wish to be repaid the . . 1 , 000 /- but that he intends it to fora the basis oi a lumiture i-und. If this assuretion is correct the r&lt;3#300/- spent in excess could be added to it and a figure fixed which the Assistant political gent should pay monthly into the fund. lours sincerely,Bahrain, Dated the 14th August 1936• To H.B.M. f s political Agent, ^ Bahrain, •'* \ After Compliments.

I told him that the rent asked for wa .3 high and that there were many/houses at a reduced rent. He first insisted that it was impossible to reduce a single pie but after an hour ! s dicussion with him he reduced the amount to Rs,1620/- which comes to Rs.135/- per month.

He wants that the rent should start from first May 1934 and agrees not to take any rent for the period before the first of May 1934 even if the house is used, 4. * If you approve the lease will be written in dmp^licate one copy will be for our records and one with your attestation on it will be given to him.

'&gt;/C t 5.4:37J O * (a o A.P.A’s house was rented from 1st May 1934 @ t?s . 135/~p.m. on condition that the cost of electric fittings and repairs would be advanced to the owner of the house by P.A. , which amount he v/ould recover from the rent, ('page 1, F. 18/8). A sum of ^.1221-14-6 was paid to the owner in the first instance on 17.7.34 for eepairs of the house and a further sum of c ? s .482/-was paid on 2.9.34 on account of cost of fans etc.fitted in the house (pi.see Local Fund Account vouchers for July 1935,flags A and B). Both these payments were made from Local Funds as there was no budget provision for this expenditure during the financial year 1934-35. This amount was eventually refunded by Bushire by re-appropriation under Office Allowance (pi.see pages 218,230 and 234 of file 4/l2 I, and 51 and 54 of 4/4 II) and was included in the sums of R 8 .1501-15 and ^.2445-10-3 which were debited to Office Allowance and credited to Local Fund Account on 28th February and 19th March, 1938 respectively (pi.see the Daily Cash Book, pages flagged, items marked red). This sum of R*. 1703-14-6 (R 5 .1221/14/6 + Rs.482/-) was advanced against the rent for the period from 1st May 1934 to 31st March 1935 (i.e.ll months @ R 8 .135/-p.m.= R s .1485/-). Thus there was an overpayment of R 5 .218-14-6 (R 5 .1703/14/6 - R $ . 1485/-) xhx&lt;xk adjustment of which, it seems, was overlooked against the rent of the subsequent period which, on a budget provision being made, was drawn in contingent bills from the Treasury and paid in full tothe house owner.
