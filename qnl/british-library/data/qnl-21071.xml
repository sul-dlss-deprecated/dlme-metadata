Bushire, 26th CctolDer 19 29, The negotiations with Persia re Bahrain have undoubtedly advanced a little as Taimourtache has defin- -itely stated that Persia will he willing f to acknowledge the independence of the Shaikh-Governors, hut will require a quid pro quo from His Majesty's G-oveminent. At present the counter demands are excessive, amounting, when reduced to pounds sterling, to a sum which the Minister has worked out as approximating 3| million pounds sterling Sir Bohert Olive has informed Taimoutrache that such a demand is preposterous and must he reduced. r Taimourtache ^ O is apparently prepared to ^reduce it and the question is now reduced to a bargaining match. In the meantime Taimourtache has agreed to issue stri-cter orders regarding the preservation of the status q^uo in the G-ulf, and,although passport regulations stand, the position of the Bahran^ah at lioharnmerah has 'been considerably eased. They are no longer being bullied into taking out registration papers as Persian subjects and are being freed from secret police supervision. I am still pressing for the grant of permission to EaJi Abood Bahrani- for his return to Mohammerah and I expect shortly to hear that he has returned. This would remove all the immediate grievances and the main question of the legal right of the British Government to protect Bahrainis must remain for settlement in the Treaty. On the question of Persian,representation in Bahrain I give you the following extract from one of Sir Captain C. Gr. Prior, Political Agent, Bahrain.I \ Sir E. Olivet despatches :- In paragraph 23 of his letter Teymourtache speaks of the Persian Government having the right to app&amp;int their M representative H in Bahrein to protect Persian interests. I explained to him that there could he no question of appointing a Persian Consul. The Shaikh of Bahrain would not hear of foreign Consuls. Bahrain was a small island and once a country appointed a Consul, half a dozen ottiers might wish to do the same, the Americans to protect their missionaries, the Germans to look after the occasional German ship that might call th- -errand so od . His Highness replied ^that it was precisely because he realised that there might he diff- -iculties ahout a Consul that he had used the word representative'• He went on to speak of the import- -ance of the Persian colony, of the Persian school, et-c. I said that there were always apt to he unfortunate differences between the Sunni and Shiah inhabitants of the island and that it was much best to leave it to the Political Resident to keep the peace. Finally he reduced his demand to one of the leading members of the Colony being authorised to speak on their behalf and though he did not employ the word 'Agent** his request practically amounted to a sort of unofficial agent. I should be glad to learn whether it would be possible to meet his wishes in this modified form.** I have already, after consulting you, informed Government of the difficQlties attending the appointment of a Persian representative to the Shaikh. They now ask if a representative accredited to Political Agent can be p7\emitted. This would recognise the Political Agent's right to protect Persians'and I am myself inclined to accede to this request, especially as Sir R. Clive thinks it would help to put-matters through. I informed SiJ? Hobert of the antagonism of the various Persian sections and he suggested that two representatives might be permitted, one for Shiahs and one for Sunnis. I await your reply to a telegram I sent you before sending a reply to the Government of India. The wording of the articles in the proposed treaty affecting -Bahrain are I Article 1 . II y aura paix perpetuelle amitie sincere entire les hautes parties contractantes et entre leurs successeurs respectifs. Chacun des hautes parties contractantes, d*accord avec 1avec les otiligations lui incoinbant par suite du Pacte de ' P la Societe des Nations et du Traite mi^tilateral pour la Renonciation de la Guerre, signe a Paris le 27 aout 1928, s^engage a respecter I'integrite territoriale et is 4 / 1 *independance politique de 1*autre haute partie contram -ante, y compris des territoires pour la defense desquels * n celle-ci est responsa'ble, et tout autre Chef d*Btat dont # les relations conventionelles avec cette haute partie contractante a la date de la signature du present traite^ ne permettent pas la cession d*un tel territoire a une autre Puissance quelconque. Article 7 . 3a Majeste imperiale le Shah de Perse reconnait 1 * independence des Shaikhs Gouverneurs de Bahrein et les relations speciales qui les unlent au Gouvermnent de Sa Majeste 'britanni^ue dans le Royaume-Uni Grande-Br etagne de l^Irlande du Nord au Gouvernment des Indes. The Persians wish to modify the wording a 'bit and the matter is under discussion. I want the Persians to recognise as categorically as possible Bahrain's special | treaty relations with us and- not merely to recognise the Ghaikh-Governors * independence# If our special treaty relations are recognised the concession of our right to protect Bahrainis in Persia should more easily 'be secured, right, as a matter of fact, does not amount to much since the abolition of capitulations, I do not anticipate any difficulty in getting the Shaikh to agree formally to he guided hy our advice in | all important matters. The Government of India would like a formal undertaking to this effect signed 'by the Shaikh Just ahout the time the Persian treaty goes through, | The latest date, given verbally hy the Minister, is March next ■i- ^ N next 'but, as you know, many dates for the signing of the Treaty have 'been fixed in the past, I am sorry you were utiahle to come to Bushire while the Minister was here, hut as a matter of fact he now looks upon the Bahrain alleles as easy of disposal , and was more interested in the other clauses. Khan Bahadur Isa g^ave me a substantially correct account of the stage the negotiations had reached when I met him off Farur ten days ago. It was most remarkable as he must have received the news long before I did. I informed the Minister, who said Taimourtache had tackled him on the suhjject of leakage of information a few days 'before he left Tehran and had given his opinion that naval officers must have 'been talking. This was impossible as the naval officers had no inform- -ation. Khan Bahadur Isa told me lie got his inform -ation from some Persians at Dubai recently returned from Bushire, wno, he understood, had visited Tehran, It looks as though Taimourtache was sounding public opinion, but the Minister thinks not.CONFIDENTIAL.

Of these the Sunnis though the smaller in n 'mbers are the more influential, for - 1 $ they comprise the wealthier merch nts and traders and the skil led artis ns, boatbuilders m sonscar, enters anc the liice. The Bhi'.hs are mainly petty shopkeepers, coffee and tea shop proprietors and motor drivers. They provide almost all the day labourers and dock workers and most of the bad characters of the Persi n community are to be found in their ranks. .3. The Sunnis are naturally on better terms with the Shaikh,- having the -s me faith and mode of worship, nd their relations with him,are on the whole,good. The Shi ahs have much less respect and goodwill for the Shaikh who not unnaturally cannot escape the bi s that the more or less open hatred bew^te^n Tunnis and r 'hajihs gives rise to. L cannot call to mind any instance in recent times when His Ex cellency has shown any active dislike for the Shia Persians, and the 'gency'has of course stood as a buffer between the:a a and any active ill-treatment. 4. Their relations with the Arab communities follows in the main the s me religious cle .vage. The Sun.ii Persians are on good terms with the Sunni Arabs, and the Shi ah Persians are on good terms with the.Shiah Arabs, or at least were, for the recent persecutions of Bahama at uhaa- merah have effected a notable change in this respect, and : there is now something approaching hostility between them, the Bahama at auh-unaerah being for the most part Shi ah Aral , p SHPage 2. The Sunni Fersinne occasion illy intermarry with Arabs, but it is unusual for Shaih Persians to do so. 5. It should be noted that the large fejdi element 1 • mong the 'rabs dislike all classes of Persians, but . rtici- larly the ThJih^ whom they esteem worse than Europeans or * T ews. They are particularly tuirioyed by the Mulu.rram proces sions, nd if not kept in check would at these times bfcome violent and break up rozeichanes. It will be^rec~lled that the riots of 1)23 were n inst-.nce of this ill-feeling of 'ejdis directed against Pefs rns, an ill-feeling which still smoulders and v/ould readily burst into fl mes. 6« This Bumrer the illfeeling between the Sunnl rabs other than ejdis ) and the Persian Shi .hs was better than it has bees for many ye rs pnst, and the unusr-1 spect k ± cle was seen of their paying visits to Matima , rozekhanes ) together with Sunni Persians. The ill treatment of Bahama P at ~ ihammer'h oefore alluded - has undoubtedly hcx .d a bad effect and any entente hag received a severe setback, anc if it con tinues, unabated till next year it will probably give rise to interference with . uhi rrr.m processions and rozejchanes. -*■ 7. There is an undercurrent of Arab feeling against . al' Persians which is directed against their privileged posi- tion, and support by the Agency, i\ support which the Persi ms are somewhat ipt to throw in their faces. The fact that lio foreigners can acquire property in Persia and that many Per sians ov/n extremely valuable property, both in real estate such as garrensIS water rights and buildings, in Bahrain is unfavourably coiiimented upon,.and there is a feeling th t they should be mide to return where they came from. There is no doubt that th- abler Persian merchants are making considerable headway, and now that customs restrictions have almost killed the trade of Lingeh and the sm Uer Gulf ports they tend to concentrate their businesses in Bahrain. ~ 8. The two ersianx com unities have little lovePag®.3 for each others and theii animosity is principally based on religio; s antip; thy. This year there were signs of iaore syn pathy betwe n the p rties, and Sunni boys are now to be seen reading side by side with 'ohi «h boys in the .ic-in Persian school The younger generation sh :w a more liber 1 attitude towards each other due partly to lojcer religious ideas and partly to the recent growth of natioanl sentiment. There are individual friendships between men of the opposite parties; but little business de alings and soci il intercourse is principally confin ed to solemn occsaions such as Ids and marriages. Relations _ have however steadily improved in recent years and with a con tinuance of the ax Brit- nnica which shelters them, a permanent improvement is not too much to hope for. . o far as I am aware their grievances are few. They /would natural y prefer to be under the administration of their own government, but they come to Bahrain of their'own accord ns and mostly proper here. I have heard complaints tht they, 'A more especially the 50txix nhiahs, have not been given their pro- per position at public functions etc., but apart the dislike of rabs in general jfor Persians in general which fluctuates from time to time, the hiahs have few members who have sufficient soci* 1 position to en -ble them to talce a more prominent place. 10. The passport regulations are resented by all ler- sians, who find it interferes seriously with their trade and liberty of movement, but the Bahrain State had* no options, o}t to reti iate in,this matter. The trade in sailing boats from the sm 1'! ports on the ersi n side has undoubtedly been i rej dicef by ti is, for it is ^difj-icult for such people to ob tain vis s without going some distance. II. I underst nd some resentment was felt that the boys oi the eroi n school were stopped from parading the streets in mi 1 it ry formations with bugles and national fl .gs, and com plaints were m::de to Bushire and Tehran, anc finally the Gover nor of the Oulf Torts made a representation to the Hcsidency in the natter. This compl: int is quite nreasonable for the idea underlying It wa B quite cle^r to the Arabs who nuturallyThe '.gency P Bahrain 4th Mov.- I 29 T hr.ve discussed the matter of a . ersian spoiceBmun A or soplcesernen ksrK with Bel r e» an' he shares my opinion. 1 Fersi? ns here h^ve never felt ck * found any diffi- i culty in 'bringing forward any griev nve to ray knowledge, and they would f re no bet .er w4.th sp kesinen.

I see no reason whatever for this concession to the Persians. They h.ve a privileged position here as it is, and enjoy al'! m n-er of conces^ ions which t ie Bahama in ersia h ve to do without.

The Adviser. i Bahrain State. jyl a M 0 fi A D u a . With reference to your request for some notes on the Persian question I enclose the following remarks. Persians in -Bahrain consist of Shias and Sunnis* Shias ^•edominate in the proportion of three to two. The Sunnis include a number of important and wealthy merchants and they own much property in town and country. The Shias are almost entirely petty shop-keepers, ^jnlies, labourers and itinerant pedlars. The Sunnis though numerically inferior are more influential in Bahrain than their Shia compatriots. The reason for this is that they are wealthy and on good terms with the local Arab mercantile community many of whom are themselves of Persian origin. The Shia Persians mingle a certain amount with the Snia Baharna but on the whole they are not really friendly with them. Some religious differences exist between them though outwardly their creeds are the same. o The Sunni and the Shia Persians dislike eachother. They associate only in trade. - The. Shias are publicly patriotic and openly support their Government; the Sunnis publicly revile it. The Shia Persians are disliked by the local Arabs A bitter enmity exists between the ifegdis in Bahrain and Persians of both sects. This feeling came to a head some years ago v&amp;en a riot was organised by the Kozaibis and several people were billed. The attitude of Shaikh hamed towards the Persians is a mild dislike, though naturally he would not admit this openly. Shaikh Mohamed admits being, and is, actively antagonistic towards them. Shaikh Abdulla appears to be indifferent to them. The Khalifa as a whole have few dealings with them. The fact that Shaikh liamud bin Subah, ex President of the Meglis Tajara, is friendly with Persians is adversly commented on by his own relations. Local Arabs and Baharna generally resent the fact that Persians have acquired so much landed property in Bahrain, but they equally resent the fact that the Negdis have also acquired much property. The two sects of Persians are each split up into two factions The rival factions are very bitterly opposed to eachother. Of the Sunni Persians the leader of one faojiioa is Khan Lahaa-r -iO^iiica oiiciif, nis onponent is *iaji -^ohamed xaycb -Jiunji. Mohamed Tayeb has the largest following but Mohamed She.rif, owing to his superior intelligence and his friendship with the powerful Yusuf Kanoo has most influence. The lasting emuity between these two menand their supporters is reflected in their business c relations. The Shia, Persians are less evenly divided. Their real leader is Abdul Ifebi Bushiri a' mischievous man of considerable intelligence. An opposition party does exist under the leadership of two men, Audel Ketei-KafiaFUHi-stftd Kasim Shirazi and Abbas Kazaruni, but in matters of real importance the Persian Shias are controlled by AOdel -^ebi Bushiri. In certain local matters such as the management of the Persian schools and municipal elect-ons the two factions are in opposition# # It is suggested that a Persian Ag-ent or spokesman should be appointed to reprebent Persian opinion to the Political Agent in Bahrain. The appointment of one individual to represent the whole Persian community is an impossibility owing to religious diffejences. Two persons would be necessary. If two persons were elected they would be Abdel Nebi Buhsiri and Mohamed Sherif or Mohamed Tayeb. The appointment of either of these last two would result in friction between their respective factions. Personally I see no necessity for such an appointment, and from the point of view of the iahrain State I consider it would ce a dangerous innovation. If a Persian ' representative were appointed the Uegdis would immediately press for more ° ff , rec °^ n ';l;°' t Abdel Aziz Kozaibi. the unofficial ajent of Ibn baoud. In recent years the influence of the Kozaibis has increased out oi all bounds. Mainly owing to Shaikh named's personal feelings towards Ion ^aoud the Kozaibis have become most insolent towards the ^anrain Government. The only corrective that exists is the intense rivalry oetween them and the Kanoo faction. There are two public bodies of importance in Bahrain, the Meglis Tajara and the Municipal Council. Qrr these Persians of both sects are well represented. On the Meglis Tajara there are four members appointed by the Government, K.S. Mohamea bnerif, J&lt;*ohamed ^ayeb Khunji, Abc'el Nebi -'ushiri and another. On tae municipal Council there are two Persian members, chosen by public ballot, one is the son of Abdul iiebi Bushiri. the other 1 ^ * j^^reli ious ' Mohamed Sherif's. These two persons were chosan by their religious compatriots after a most active election two years ago. If the Political Agent wishes to rind representative members of the Persian community these two persons fit ^r^ognisef them, that they might be informed that the Political Agen* ^ lected or their successors after the neglect ^ ^J . f necessity should representatives ol tne F ® 1S 0 T,r,T-pssion of views from them on arrive he will 1,6 'T thev renre sent^ I think this arrangement behalf of the people who , ' nt arld i d o not think Bahrain has no wish to encourage.

During -i^uharram they are allowed to carry ou eir religious processions and observances with the utmost freedom, anu the very nature of these must be unpalatable to the Sunni Arabs of an Arab state of which the Government is Sunni. During the period of nearly four years that 1 have served The Shaikh s Government I have never heard any general complaint from lersians. either onia Sunni. The comparison between the treatment of Persians in Bahrain and Bahrain subjects in Persia reveals a remarkable difference. In Persia the Bahrana are suoject to innumerable vexatious restrictions. they have been forced to wear a headdress tnat is attempts have been made to compel them to renounce uneii nationality, and innumerable cases of oppression h^ve occure . o e r ter of action has been taken by the Bahrain Government of passports.

Gir, I am directed to inform you that in the treaty which is at present under negotiation nith the Persian Govemrnent it is proposed to insert a non- .aggression clause under which each of the High Con tracting. Parties would agree to respect the territorial independence of the other. A copy of the clause, as r ^ at present drafted, is attached herewith.for your in formation and while it may be subject to verbal modification in the course of the negotiations the - purport of it uiay be ragarded as sufficiently fixed for the present purpose. You will notice that in this clause the Persian Govermaent undertake to respect the territorial independence of the British Governmant, and, further, of those territories for the protection of which the British Government are responsible and of the Heads of States in special treaty relation with His Britannic Majesty., Among these Heads of btates is S ultan of usuat. the Shaikh of Bahrain. Shaikh o-f Kuwait. In this clause, as originally drafted, it was considered that it would suf fi ce —Jsuffice If a reciprocal undertaking was given by Hla Majesty's Government to resihect the territorial Integrity of Perfela: but the Persian Govermaent pointed out that this would Impose unilateral obli gations on Persia since the states unaer special treaty relations would not have to give any reciprocal undertaking to respect the *territorial Integrity of Persia. You will see therefore thatln the clause as now grafted the addition has been made 'in his own name and in the name of those utates and 'territories to which this article refers**: that is to say, it is proposed that His Majesty 's uovernment should give an undertaking on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat Shai kh of Bahrain, to respect the territorial independ- Shaikh of Kuwait ence of Persia. In order to enable them to do this, it is considered desirable jihat they should obtain the requisite authority from'the rulers concerned*. 'I am therefore to request that you will obtain a Sultan of Muscat or Muscat formal letter from the shaikh of Shaikh of Council Bahrain authorising His Majesty^ Government to sign Kuwait the non-aggression clause, in the sense of the draft which has been coinaunicated to him, on his behalf.' The Hon'ble the Political Resident would be glad if you would obtain the requisite undertaking with as little delay as possible and itfform him by telegram when it has been signed: considerable progress, it * is believed, is being made with the Percian negotiations and it is essential that the formal assent of the rulers concerned should be obtained as soon as possible.

The majority of the file's correspondence takes place between the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Cyril Barrett until November 1929), and the Political Agent at Bahrain (Geoffrey Prior).The withdrawal of Persian claims over Bahrain raised a number of implications for British representatives in the Gulf, and these comprise the contents of the file. The main implications were: the treatment of Persian subjects in Bahrain; British representation of Persian subjects in Bahrain; the question of whether there should be an official or non-official Persian representative in Bahrain (which both the Resident and Political Agent were strongly objected to); and passports and certificates of identity for Bahrainis travelling within and beyond the Gulf.In response to a request from Barrett, Prior compiled detailed notes on the Persian communities in Bahrain. His official typewritten response (with handwritten notes) are included in the file (folios 43-47, 48-56). These notes include comments on Persian Sunnis and Shias in Bahrain, their relations with the Āl Khalīfah family, animosity between Nejdis [Saudis] and Persians, Persian schools and property in Bahrain, and the Political Agency's ability to represent Persians in Bahrain. Further notes on the Persian communities, sent to Prior by the Advisor to the Bahrain Government, Charles Dalrymple-Belgrave, are also included (folios 60-61A). A letter in English and Arabic, from Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah to Prior, dated 23 April 1930, is an undertaking not to attack Persian sovereignty or to violate Persian independence (folios 67-68).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Travel documents</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rights of states</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Political reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Law reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000369#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
