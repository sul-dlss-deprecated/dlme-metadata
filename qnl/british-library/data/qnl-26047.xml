(Enel, to paper 2). The G/l. clearly agree that this social allowance of Rs.75 p. month for duties as Sec. of P.G.L.S. Advisory Committee should, after June 1st, 1948, be paid by H.M.G. Major Dredge, 1st Secretary in Bahrein, confirms this, and says Mr. Logsdail has already been paid by H.M.G. his allowance for those months (paper 9) which the G/l. are now asking should be reimbursed to them. I suggest, therefore, we request Major Dredge to ask Mr. Logsdail if he has been paid by both H.M.G. and G/l., and that we draw the attention of the G/l. to paper 2.

Would you please retrieve it as soon as you can and look into the point in paragraph 2 of Mr. ^ Selby*s letter? It looks as if I have made a mistake and I ought perhaps to apologise. Ever since Mr. Logsdail swam into my ken I have felt that he would have been better dealt with on a separate file from the main problem of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. Now that the latter subject is becoming active it makes it all the more difficult to deal with both subjects on one file. I should be very grateful if you would glance through the previous correspondence about Mr. Logsdail and see if it would not be fairly easy to transfer the Logsdail correspondence (or copies of it|to a separate file. I trust that the Logsdail problem will shortly come to an end so I do not want to create a lot of work in making a new file. Perhaps you would do what you think best. My grasp of the complicated details of this file is somewhat tenuous, but it does seem that we had on record the arrangement that the Government of India would pay the sum of Rs. 75 per month to Mr. Logsdail up to the date of his proceeding on leave prior to/vafcutftt, recovering in due course from the United Kingdom Government. (See second enclosure to paper (3))* However, I imagine that Mr. Selby will gladly forget about this in his pleasure at seeing the letter from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, at paper (24), a copy of which should be enclosed with our letter, of which I attach a draft. I have discussed the mechanics of repaying the Government of India with both Mr. Kordik and Mr. Ireland and there seems to be no objection to the reimbursement of the Government of India by the High Commissioner’s Office in New Delhi. They will recovery from A.G.D. who will in turn recover from the Foreign Office.

Logsdail of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, I am afraid that,! had overlooked your letter to Hr. Taylor, Pol.Ext.7957/49 of the 2nd September. It arrived in this Office while I was on leave and was seen by him at the time .'Z 2. I am afraid that your reference to the Government of India 1 s letter No. F26(2)AWT/47'of the 19 th June paints an unfair picture of the arrangement which v/e made with regard to the continuance of the special allov/ance of Rs.75 a month to Mr. Logsdail. It is true that that letter made quite clear that the responsibility for the payment of that allowance v/ould be transferred to His Majesty’s Government along with the Persian Gulf Lighting Service itself, but in the enclosures to my letter togharrison, 43/CS/18 of the 29 th July, it was made clear that the system by which the allowance was to be paid was that the Government of India v/ould continue to pay the allov/ance of :s. 75 P e r month, ^ recovering thq? sums so disbursed fro:} His Majesty's Government. c? M &gt; ) 3 . Yougm.ll remember that in the second paragraph of ray letter 48 /Cd/l 8 of the 29th July to^Tlarrison I expressed some doubts in regard to the manner in which these payments v/ould be reclaimed by the Government of India. The Government of India’s letter on this subject which was enclosed with my letter 48/CS/18 of the 1 st September did little to clarify this, and quite frankly, when 1 receivecf^gredge' s letter 48/l £/4H of the 14th October, I assumed that his third paragraph was providing an answer to the mystery v/hich I had been trying to clarify, and that the Collector of Central Excise,Bombay, had recovered the Rs.75 a month paid by the Government of India to Mr. Logsdail from the Persian Gulf Lighting Service funds. It did not occur to me that the Rs. 75 a- month was being paid to Mr. Logsdail in Bahrain as well as from Bombay. 4. As you say, hov/ever, the best, indeed the only, method of clearing this up v/ould be for Major Dredge’s successor to clarify the position, in consulta tion with Mr. Logsdail if necessary. ,7e hope, hov/ever, that he will be able to do so at an early date. The Government of India were, it will be remembered, most co-operative in the matter of transferring Mr. Logdail's services to us and v/e do not want to hold up payment to them for a debt which we are clearly under an obligation to repay. 5 . I enclose for your information a copy of an interim letter which we are sending to the Government of India on this subject. 6 .
