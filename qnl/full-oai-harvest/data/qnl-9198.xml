Basidu was a former naval depot that had been under British control since [circa] 1820. However, in the opinion of the Law Officers, Britain had only a 'shadowy' claim to Basidu; and when the Government of Persia decided to claim Basidu as Persian territory, Britain decided to arrange for the evacuation of those inhabitants who wished to leave. The evacuation, and the hauling down of the British flag, took place on 12 April 1935 (folio 10).The papers cover: discussion of British rights over Basidu; consideration of the effect of British withdrawal on the inhabitants; the visit of Persian officials and the taking by them of a census of the inhabitants; agreement with the proposal of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that Â£400 should be made available for the costs of the evacuation (half to be paid by HM Treasury, half by the Government of India); the conscription of local persons by the Persian authorities; and arrangements for the final evacuation of Basidu by the Royal Navy.The file includes correspondence from HM Minister, Tehran; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Foreign Office; and British naval officials.The French language content of the papers consists of a single folio (a suggested addition to article V of the General Treaty, on folio 193).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Military service</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Basidu</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Evacuation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000186#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000186#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
