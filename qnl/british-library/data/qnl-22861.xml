The breeze became half a ^ale, and the launch tooBCd about for a couple of houra, and the coaning at the bowu was carried away, and the wheel damaged. Finally the Commander of the r liaroda ', fearing that loos ef life might ensue, rehoioted the launch, and I had to ^o out next day ana t©?f it off.

It is a good plan, as you get into the vessel to order a floor 'board to 'be lifted and if it is not clean under- -neath, 'be harsh with the Tindal or engine nriver as the case may 'be, A good question for the Driver is to make him show you his spanners and oil can, in fact anything you can think of. Once the crew know they have to have the vessel spotlessly clean whenever you go a'board, they will get into ' the haMt of doing things automatically• if you could possibly spaie the time to 'be present the first time they 'beach the Launch and direct them, the jot will 'be easy* We trust the lists will 'be found useful 'but / if there is any further information you require we shall 'be most Bnbject to the conditions at back hereof.This Tender U subject to the following conditions:— All prices are subject to altration without notice and to c.mfii'mation at the time the order is received J Promises of delivery are given without Guarantee and Whilst evgry effoit will be made to adhere to them as closely as possible, we do not hold ourselves responsible for delays arising from any cause whatever and in no cas^ shall delay in delivery be ground for rejecting goods.

Tear Sirs The damage to the M/L Tiana has been set right, though the appearance of the vessel has not been im proved, and I am glad to say that her first trials have pro ved very satisfactory. She is speedy and a good sea boat. There is one point, however, on which I should be glad to be reassured by you. The only support for the anchor chain, or means of making the launch fast by the oows, appears to be the two hanse holes, and a somwwhat unsubstantial look- brass bollard fastened by four small brass screws. It is ne cessary at present, to leave the launch moored in the harbour, and should a storm spring up, it appears very likely that these bollards would not take the strain, unless they are very strong ly reinforeced from below. It is impossible to discover if this is the case, as the petrol tank is in the We.y. If you do not consider that these bollards are suf ficiently strong to face the possibility oi holding the launch in a thirty mile wind, do you consider that it would be possible to make some kind of an opensting immediately in front oi -he steering whe^l, in the varnished deck, and run a rope theough on to the keel. If a sm 11 brass plate with a hole in the cen tre was let into thi^ deck, the work could be made quite neat, and taking advantage of the hoisting loop on the keel, a connec tion could be made which would ride out the stiiiest breeze -nd sea.DATED 15th FEBRUARY ^0 From the Coiranander, S.S,^Bar oda* Vo y.211» To, I'he Mesopotamia Persia Corpn Ltd., Afcent e., B, I.

The Agency, Dear Sir, We have read with regret,your letter Uo. 297 dated the 18th ultimo. The writer has heen away in JSomhay and this letter has unavoidably 'been delayed. When the 'Diana 11 was 'being loaded the writer personally visited the StS, ' , SAR0DA ,, and met the Chief and 3rd Officer and asked 'both to 'be most careful in the handling of the € launch. They 'both said that every care would be excercised. But apparently this was not done, as the coaming in front, on to which the steering wheel is attached, could not possibly 'be carried away once the launch was in the water. 'Tith this in view it means that this damage must have been done in the off-loading or the rehoisting. The launch was placed on deck in sucfr a position that the foredeck of the launch went under the shallow shade deck of the b.S.'EARODA' and,it is more than probable that the coaming was carried away by coming in contact with this shade deck.

Had we known you required a rope lender we should have most certainly fitted one. We much regret that owing to a certain amount of rush to. get the ^Diana' away and the obtaining of a passport for the driver the making of an agreement was completely forgotten 'by us. The driver, was however told 'by the writer that he would - 'be 'bound 'by you for a year at a monthly pay of Ss. 60/-, and that if he did not give you complete satisfaction he would never get another j o'b through us. \7e have .just received your letter of the 3rd instant and are pleased to note that the repairs have 'been carried out as well as possible. We are also happy to see that you consider her a fast and good sea 'boat, and trust she will always remain so. We feel certain she will, providing she is looked after. You need have no fear a'bout thB launch getting away in a storm, as even if the 'bollards and fairleads do give way the end of the anchor chain is securely fastened to the keel 'by means of a through 'bolt and shackle. It would he as well to instruct the Tindal to see that the nut on the 'bolt is secure to start with, after this there is no need to continually do so unless the chain is ever completely taken out for painting. The only fear is that the anchor may drag in a really heavy ston?, 'but this is not likely providing the chain is let out to OHW its full length, only keeping sufficient on 'board to take one tarn arrunl of a rope Fender was made, as far asb. r. HERMAN &amp; MOHATTA, LTD. - 3 - around the 'bollard, through one fairlead and down to the anchor. If you will kindly let us know the depth of water at your moorings we will soon know if you have sufficient chain. In the meantime if you will lengthen the chain 'by adding stout Manilla Rope of not less than 1' diamet ey* 'between the anchor and the anchor end of the chain it will eleminate any tendency of the OLi pi! 7l\*Z k-i, anchor dragging. [$&gt;=£-) ^ The writer asked your driver Ahhas what depth of water the launch would 'be anchored in and his reply was 12* • If this is so, your present length of chain of six fathoms, (36* feet) would 'be ample. The Bollard is very strongly fixed, having a heavy 'backing piece, (Under the deck) through which the 'bolts are driven and rivet ted up on the 'bollard itself. It is well to remeiQ*ber that the greater the distance 'between anchor and the 'boat the 'better the anchorage, 'but it is not always possible to have an ideal mooring owing to other craft in the near vicinity. .oW 'Stefc-L, Uhen putting out the anchor it must 'be rememTDered that when the tide turns the vessel will move around at the end of the chain. ^ As a rough guide, the amount of chain to 'be given oat will 'be approximately three times the depth of water at full tide for ffeiir weather and five times the depth at full tide for stormy weather. We are despatching the paint and varnish ordered 'by you 'by this mail. ssh/NB/pg # Yours faithfully, 3.H.HiC&lt;MAW &amp; MOHATTA.LTD. « %CONTRACTORS TO GOVERNMENT.

I am dismissing the driver Othman and returning him to Karachi as I find he has no knowledge of the internal mechanism of his en;ine. I already had 2 men able to drive a launch and only asied you to engage this man as he was supposed to 'be specially familiar with Sleeve valve engines. 3. 2 days ago the Launch went out and after a short while the engine heated up and stopped. He could not restart it and had no idea Y3hat had caused the trouble, and the Launch had to be tewed back. It has been put right by the ningineer of the Steam Launch and a local fitter, but has lost its speed. 4. Apart from this, Othman has not been altogether satisfactory. It has to be constantly impressed on him tliat the Sukhani and not he is in charge of the Launch, and on one occasion he carelessly started his engine when a member of the crew was freeing the propeller from an entanglement and seriously wounded him. 5.
