A copy has been sent to r, Government of fadierr- The Political UeDick^fr-wa the Peroian Gid-kConfidential I D*0* Ho. C/352-l.b/5 Dated the 29th May 1939. Dear Sir Irenehard, In paragraphs 3(iil) and 5 of my demi-official letter No. C/666 of the 27th October 1938 I said that I thought con sideration should be given to schemes for providing employment for the poorer classes of Bahrain. 1 have had this thought in mind ever since f and with it various ideas for creating industries which might supplement and ultimately replace the oil industry in Bahrain, le are exhorting the Bahrain Government to set aside large sums of money annually from their oil royalties in order to provide a Reserve sufficient in future years to ensure the continued administration of Bahrain on the scale that exists at present; but I cannot help feeling that the money which is going into the Reserve is not being quite sufficiently 'active'. It is admittedly earning interest and so is providing for the continua nce of social services in future&gt; but it does not actively con tribute towards the commercialisation of Bahrain and the eonsequen increased prosperity of its people. I do not mean to suggest that I would recommend a serious diminution of the sums placed in the Reserve annually* but I think we should consider whether some part of the annual surpluses should not be devoted to more productive schemes* 2. When Ibn Saud was beinti taken round the Refinery, Shaikh Hamad pointed out to him a stone-crusher which was at work and most inaccurately described it as a machine for making cement. • At/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle* C.B.B. t Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.At about the same time the California Standard Company* s senior geologist was in Bahrain and enquired whether cement was made here, and it not why not* These two remarks led to the thought that it might be possible to manufacture cement in Bahrain, and I have had some discussion on this matter with Thornburg. Broadly speaking there are, I gather, three main requisites — fuel, limestone and clay. In Bahrain we have unlimited fuel -- the waste gases from the oil which are burnt off at present | we have unlimited quantities of limestone, though we should want to know something of its relative purity; and there is clay, used by the potters of ’All. We do not know how extensive the clay beds are, but I have suggested to Belgrave that he might be able to borrow or hire a geologist from the Oil Company to make a rough survey of the (more or less) surface clay deposits. If these are ade quate then it seems highly probable that a most profitable indus try can be started. I think it is uncommon for the three main requisites to be found located - practically free - in so small an area, and this factor should go a long way to ensuring that Bahrain can manufacture cement at highly competitive prices. The demand of course exists, and though the Bahrain Petroleum Company may not require so much cement in future, certainly the California Arabian Company will be using thousands of tons; probably Petroleum Concessions Limited would be a big purchaser; Abadan (which I think uses Japanese cement at present) might be a good customer if we can disguise origin; and Iraq with its irrigation projects and so om should be a most valuable customer. All this of course depends on Bahrain being able to produce a really high grade Portland cement at a competitive price. 3. If once one industry is started others can get going also. I still think that the mother-of-pearl button Industry is a possibility, but this would depend to a great extent on India giving Bahrain a preferential customs rate. I think I am right in saying that pearl buttons in India are almost a Japanese monopoly /-monopoly and there would be little chance of breaking that monopoly unless a preferential customs tariff enabled Bahrain to put its product on the market in India at a competitive price* As you know Indian products pay five per cent duty in Bahrain ~~ except for certain articles of luxury which pay ten per cent* Would it therefore be possible to enquire from India what their normal tariff on mother-of-pearl buttons is and whether they would give Bahrain a preferential rate corresponding to the Bahrain rate on Indian goods ? 4* I think too that it ought to be possible to do something with the flesh of the hundreds of thousands of oysters which are fished up annually in the pearling. It might be possible to extract valuable oils* for after all the flesh of the edible oyster at any rate is supposed to be full of vitamins? and I should like to know, if the information can be obtained in London, whether pearl fisheries in other parts of the world, e*g* Australia, run any subsidiary industries for the extrac tion of saleable commodities from the flesh of the oyster* Alternatively it might be possible to turn the flesh into a valuable manure* 5. Another possibility is to rationalise the fishing industry of Bahrain. Large quantities of dried fish are exported, but everything is done in such a hap- ha sard manner that I feel convinced that the profits are nothing like the size they ought to be* 6* You have had personal experience of the excellence of the Bahrain prawns* A small but profitable industry might well be created by tinning these prawns* Admittedly it would not be a twelve-months-a-year industry, for the prawns come and go without much regard for dates and seasons as far as I can make out. Nevertheless there should be money in this, and employment for a certain number of people.7* In another direction, we ought without further delay to get on with extensive improvements in agriculture* We still await the Agricultural Expert’s report, and I rather suspect that after all the delay which has occurred it may be of no very great value, nevertheless we do know that valuable vegetable crops can be grown here - and that a market exists for them* Belgrave has proved that sugar cane can be grown and sold; and even if there were nothing better there is still room for much expansion in date palm cultivation. As far as I know there are considerable areas of unclaimed cultivable land in certain parts of Bahrain, and I have advised Belgrave to put his Land Department on to registering all such lands as Government property; and we know that there are magnificent artesian water supplies. If however State or quasi-State agricultural projects an a large scale are to be initiated the first essential is for the Bahrain Government to obtain control over all artesian water supplies in the island. At the moment terrifying quantities of good water are being wasted. Artesian wells have been sunk in extravagant * profusion and many of them are not even provided with valves to shut off the flow. His Highness the Shaikh himself and the A1 Khalifah are among the worst offenders, and it will need considerable pressure, preferably originating in advice from His Majesty^ Government themselves, to induce His Highness to agree on his own account and to order other landowners to put their artesian supplies under Government control. It should not be a difficult task, though it may take some time and money, to ascertain by experiment the quantity of water required to irrigate a specific area for a specific crop in any particular locality in Bahrain. Once this is done all artesian wells should be fitted with locked valves and meters, and it should be the business of a properly conducted Government Department /«Department to flow each well to the quantity required weekly. In certain areas it will be necessary to construct cement reservoirs, into which the flow from artesian wells can be directed, in order to make a sufficient head of water to irrigate more distant areas, I am not normally in favour of State control over any privately-owned facility, but I do greatly fear the partial exhaustion of reserves of artesian water under Bahrain it the present lack of control continues* It becomes a matter of even greater Importance if an extension of agriculture on a commercial scale comes under contemplation. I have on more than one occasion already urged the need for taking periodic readings of the flow of old and new artesian wells in different localities. 8. The question then arises — how could all these projects be put into effect. As far as possible we should, I think, avoid promoting purely State ownership of new industry. At the same time we know perfectly well from years of observation that local merchants or businessmen are hopelessly incompetent to promote and manage large scale commercial activities. The solution seems to be to form something on the analogy of a Public Utility Company, with an adequate amount of State control, but with provision for investment of private money. I have even gone so far as to select a name for such a Company - the Bahrain Development Trust l To begin with it will probably have to look for most of its capital to the Bahrain Government, but once it is set on its feet and begins to show growth I feel convinced that there will be plenty of private money in Bahrain for investment in it, and at that stage the Government should be prepared to sell at par up to 49 per cent of the total capital investment. Shares should be of one rupee deno mination to enable the poorer classes to invest, particularly since I am hoping to create a class of small capitalists in Bahrain A«* 6 ** Bahrain by inducing the Oil Company to institute a thrift plan or provident fund for their local employees* The first essential is to find an enthusiast with wide experience of engineering in many different branches, who would be a quasi Bahrain Government servant at first and afterwards purely an employee of the Development Trust* He must have, as many engineers do have, some sales experience and he must of course not only possess drive but also immense reserves of tact and patience* He should in my opinion start off with the Portland cement project and gradually develop the other ideas* 9* Obviously plans quite as extensive as these, involving an outlay of possibly 20 lakhs of rupees, cannot be presented to and pressed on the Bahrain Government on my authority alone* They may even sound a little bit wild in some respects, though I am convinced in my own mind that, with the right man at the helm, the prospects are admirable. I would therefore request your approval (and possibly you may think it desirable to obtain the blessing of His Majesty^ Government and the Govern-* ment of India also) to recommening to His Highness the Shaikh the development of Bahrain's resources on some such lines as these, and in particular to searching in such quarters as may seem best for an European with wide engineering and sales experience to make a start on such development* 10* The suggestions I have made do not, of course, by any means exhaust the possible field of development* I should like to see the Development Trust take over, for instance, the busi ness management of the Electric Power Plant (Steele, admirable as he is in his own way, has no business flair); I can see further uses for surplus gas to be piped from the Oil Field and Refinery $ I would like to see a subsidiary formed to take over Motor Transport as a whole in Bahrain (it is going to be a serious problem soon, if it continues to run on the present hopelessly uneconomic basis with private ownership); I see possibilities /-7« possibilities in a big engineering and machine shop in Bahrain taking over work which the Oil Company would willingly pass to it, and 'machining' for Bahrain in general? and — without damaging Gray, Mackenzie (who could of course take shares) — there is money to be made from lighterage and barging, from ice-plants, cold storage installations, cinemas and a dozen other things. All that is necessary is a start. Bahrain has the money now - is first in the gulf to have it - and should go hard for the development of the favoured posi tion she enjoys.

Waste of water from the artesian wells in the Shaikh of Bahrain's State*Fo.C/242 of 1939 *■ 0 Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain, the 29th June 1939. My esteemed friend, I hear from the Political Agent I that there is considerable waste of water from the artesian wells in Your ' Highness’s State. It is not hidden from Your Highness that the level of the water which supplies these wells is already sinking and if this waste of j water continues there will come a time when first pumps will have to be' used- in the wells to raise water to the surface, and eventually when the water supply of your State from these wells will cease altogether, as has happened | in other parts of the world. I would strongly advise Your Highness therefore to restrict the number of new wells which may be drill ed in your State, and also to issue regulations for the economical use of water from the existing wells. This object^I venture to suggest y could be attained by the employment of mechanical devices to restrict the flow of water from the wells to the actual needs of the land to be irrigated and by constant supervision of these devices. Your Highness will appreciate that I offer this advice as I have the/2 the interests of your State at heart. I desire to express the high consideration which I entertain for Your Highness, and to subscribe myself, Your Highness’s sincere friend, Sd. T. C. Fowle. Political Resident in the Persian GulfConfidential. D«Q«mo. 608 —S» The Residency, , the 4th July 1939. Could you please refer to paragraph 4 of my letter -No.556-Sedated the 9th June 1939, on the subject of the commercial development of Bahrain. 2. You will remember that i discussed the matter with you and Relgrave on my recent visit to Bahrain. I explained that my views were that while I thou^it that the commercial development of the State might be an excellent thing in it self, it was not a question which i was prepared in any way to press on the Bahrain Government, whose entire respon sibility it was to take up the matter or not as they thou^it fit. Further, that this was perhaps hardly the time to start new commercial activities with a threat of war in the air • 3. Bel grave explained that in regard to the cement industry, which was the most promising of the various schemes considered by you, a considerable time would have to elapse before this industry could be started - if the Bahrain Government finally decided on this step, and that this time could be utilized in making enquiries and in obtaining an expert to advise on the subject. I think it would be a good thing for the Bahrain Government to set these enquiries on foot, and in particular to obtain an expert 9 s advice.

There are several distinct types of limestones and clays available in Bahrein and samples of the various types have been taken for analysis at the refinery lab. The results of these analyses will be rsady in a few days, after which time it will be possible to determine the most satisfactory blend for making Portland cement.Tbe location of a plant is practically dependent upon the location of the most suitable limestone and for clay, A fuel line frees one of the Fourth Pay gas producing wells or from one of the gathering stations could supply heat, while water from between casings in a Fourth Pay well could be obtained cheaply, provided of course that the casings did not suffer any ill effects from this cause. Should it prove Impractical to use water from, the above mentioned supply, a water well could be drilled at the plant site or water could be tapped from the Jwali camp supply provided of course that tills did not over tax the Zellaq pumps. It would be very convenient if the limestone from Jebel Dukhan proved to be satisfactory because at the H*S# comer of this Jebel the limestone has very distinct cleaveage planes which would faciliate quarrying to a great extent. There is also a natural slope at this point where benches could be blasted out without difficulty and ear tracks laid to the mill. This locat ion is also close to supplies of gas and water* Should it prove necessary to use clay for blending with the limestone the expense of out-put will be considerably increased. There are several distinct types of clay or shale which are available in Bahrein. One variety is the type used for making native mud for drilling and is found near the inner base of the rim rock. The clay outcrops vary in thickness from one or two inches to a maximum of about three feet, but in all cases there are overlying beds of hard limestone which only allow safe working to a depth of a few feet if this cap is not removed. The thickness of the limestone cap varies at different localities but the average might be taken as 35*. If the quantity of clay recovered by removing the cap could be used with the limestone of the cap to make a satisfactory blend, considerable transport ation expenses would be Saved; If on the other hand, larger quantities of clay . were required^tiien a system of room and wall stoping could be developed as this type of ground readily lends itself to mining in this mariner. Other known sources of local clay are found at several different points on the island between the beach and the bottom of the slope wlich runs to the top of the rim rock* At Zellaq and Mai amir this clay is used by the natives to fill In holes in the stone walls of their houses and compounds. The overburden above this clay only amounts to about one foot of sand and could be cleared away readily with a dragline and bucket. The depth of these cloys is believed to be two to three feet but at this level water is encoun tered and no work has been dene at any greater depth* Unfortunately there is no convenient supply of limestone in the vicinity of these clays and haulage would b© necessary. Samples of blue green and of yellow clays have been found about ^ mile from the sea shore between Barbar and Bodeyah at the North end of Bahrein. At low tide these clays are under about six inches of water and at high tide about four feet of water. The beds appear to be quite extensive and local fishermen claim that the clay is about five feet thick. If the samples prove to be of a satisfactory nature it might be advisable to auger sample this area in order to determine the exact quantity of these clays. Similar clays have also been found near the rofinery sumps and these should also be auger sampled. Attached to this letter will be found a list of samples with notes with regard to locution. At present these samples arebelng analysed at the refinery*&lt;r €&gt; (3) (a) (b) {e} (d) (e) it) la coneLLusion it will be noted that i~ The coat of fuel sad water will be very moderate as after initial instelation of lines, the upkeep coat will be low. The quantities of available raw materials is sufficient to produce at least fifteen tons of material per day for the mill even if blending from separated localities is necessary. If on the other hand simple analyses indicate that the shale and limestone in contact with each- other will form a suitable blend, then the daily output would only depend upon the output capacity of the equipment purchased, Tlie cost of local labor is cheap and it would not take long to train coolies to operate compressed air drills, Charging and firing holes would have to be done by white labor. The several locations where limestone and shale occur in contact are situated with a down grade from the cliff face which would faciliate hauling out loaded cars and also take care of any rain water. These locations are not far distant from shipping facilities and existing Continued search will doubtless discover further beds of shale bavin? similar characteristics to those already noted and it is no at unlikely that the supply of this material will sun out, while the supply of limestone is limitless. A more complete report can only be made when the results of sanole analyses are known. CRBHSTCXSample A* Sample B. Sample C. Sample D. Sample C. Sample S. Sample F. Sample Sample a* May 30, 1939.

Hopper {May 28, 1939, 'Manufacture of Portland cement at Bahrein' 8 and of Mr. A.F. Pyrah (June 10, 1939, 'Investigations of various rocks with a view to manufacturing Portland cement'). Portland cement is made by burning a mixture of calcareous and argillaceous material to clinking temperature (ordinarily 2500 - 3000° F) and grinding the resulting clinker* Allowable range in composition of Portland cement is: CaO e 60 - 64.5$ Si 02 n 20 - 24.0$ AI 2 O 3 &amp; 5 - 9.0$ Fe 203 m 2 - 4.0$ MgO m 1 - 4.0$ 803 s 1 - 1.75$ Incomplete analyses of roasted samples of Bahrein rocks show a range of 14 - 79 c /b CaO, 5-66$ SiOg, and 0.4 - 45$ iQgQg, m. blend of roasted samples was prepared which had a composition of 60$ CaO 20.5$ SiOs 7$ AlgOg Unsuccessful attempts to make cement from this are probably due to 'lack of high temperature equipments but the mix may have compositional defects not shown in partial analysis. For instance, four unroasted samples (Bbpper, May 28) contained 18-21$ MgO compared with 24-31$ CaO and it may be that Bahrein rocks are too highly magnesian for our purpose. With the possible exception of Raka, Umm Nasan and Hawar the smaller islands and shoals of the Bahrein group are not be considered for cement manufacture. There is a slight possibility that the islands mentioned above have suitable raw materials, but production costs would be much higher than on Bahrein Island, which is the only one worthy of consideration at the present time. Bahrein Island is well supplied with lime-rich rocks and the principal problem is to locate a sufficient supply of argillaceous material. There are probably few if any nearly pure clays, most being marly, but the best are seen in the inward facing 'rimrock' scarp exposing the 'Sharktooth Shale'. If further analyses fail to indicate suitable clayey rocks from this scarp, no other large out crops of Eocene clays are known to the writer, and it is quite doubtful whether suitable material could be found in the marine Miocene which is rich in marl. The most promising source of clay for cement manufacture is a massive bed about four feet thick which has been quarried for drilling mud■ iv' 2 - near where the main roads from -Awall cross the M rimrock w enroute to Manama and to the refinery* This layer is known to vary from three to five feet in thickness and its analysis (sample F, near crematory, south of refinery road) is : Cat) s 28^ SiO£ - 49^ The limestone (Sample ?l) overlying it contains 50$ CaO and 7$ SiOg. REOPl^^lD-ATIONS 1* Preliminary work suggests the desirability of prospecting for Portland cement resources on Bahrein Island* 2* This work should preferably be done by a geologist* 3. It is recommended that Mr. Gierhart of the CiSOC conduct this survey, for which he is well qualified, in combination with other geological work planned for him in Bahrein. 4. The following procedure is suggested: a* Follow the 'rimrock” scarp exposing the 'Sharktooth Shale”, noting variation in thickness and composition of the ’’drilling mud clay” (Sample F) and also its dip and distance from bottom and top of scarp* Measure and sample the section every two or three kilometers along the scarp, in search for better clay and for limy material for blending* .also look for other scarps exposing the ”Sharktooth Shale”. b. Partial analyses of samples should be followed by more complete analyses of most promising ones. It may be difficult to find samples low enough in magnesia, and this component should be one of the first determined. c. -analyses should be followed by clinkering tests of blends, probably requiring a temperature of 2500 - 3000° F. d. If suitable raw materials are found at more than one point, it should be remembered that the greater the elevation of the clay bed above the base of the scarp and the lower its dip, the larger the workings may be, as their slope converges with the claybed’s dip. However, as pointed out by Mr. Hopper, if mining is started on a scarp facing the opposite direction from that of the ”rim rock” scarp the workings can follow u£ the dip while maintaining a downgrade for loaded cars. Such a scarp is found ”at the base of a ?/addi cliff beside the road from the Refinery to Manamah” (site of samples C &amp; D, Hopper, May 30). The advantages of such a locality are obvious, and special search should be made for similar sites* e. Upon selecting a site for removal of cement materials, a hole should be drilled through the deposit as far back from the outcrop as it is proposed to mine and samples from this hole should be analyzed*J-' TFH:MBB. 3 Tills will not only indicate the aiiount and quality of available material k° a f cer ? ain where t0 start the working face, which should preferably be at a lower elevation than any material to be removed (To provide drainage, and a down grade for loaded cars)* The materials removed below the clay bed will probably be suitd&gt;le for blending. f. If suit&amp;le materials are not found in the a brief reconnaissance of the post - Eocene periphery of should be made. ^ 'rimroek scarp”, the island Respectfully submitted. Jwali, Bahrein Island.

Dear Sir, In accordance with your conversations with Messrs. Thornburg and Reith, we undertook an investigation of the availibility of raw materials suitable for the manufacture of Portland Cement. We are sorry to report that the conclusion arrived at as a result of this study was that no supply^of clay or shale of the necessary Quality exists within the Shaikhdom. Attached is a copy of the report made by Mr. R.D. &amp; G-ierhart, our geologist, entitled 'Portland Cement Production in Bahrein'. You will note that he spent three weeks m an ^ intensive search for d.eposits of clay and limestone of sufficien quantity and necessary quality, and that a number of .chemical analyses were made of various samples. An excellent outcrop of pure limestone was discovered but no good clay. For your information, we have made a very rough estimate of the cost of a Portland cement plant having a daily capacity of 15 tons, together with an estimate of operation at full capacity: Estimated cost of cement plant without a power plant Hs.4,20,000 Estimated annual operating cost ... ... ••• t 99 nnn Annual gross return(lll,000 sacks at Ks.2/-) •:* a? 000 Annual net profit not including interest &amp; depreciation 42,000 Years to pay out first cost of plant ... ... 10 • It anpears from the above figures that the pay out on a plant would not be short enough to make the proposition attractive even though the necessary raw materials were available. Also it 1 ^ evident that the importation of clay would not be economic. However, if there were a market for more than 15 tons of cemeni &lt;iaily, this financial analysis would be more favourable in that the first cost of a larger plant and the operating cost do not increase m pro portion to the output.2 We have developed a considerable amount of information on the subject of cement manufacture during the course of this study, which you may have if you desire. Also we shall be glad to lend what assistance we can in case you wish to develop any other details of this subject further. TEE B, FED. Attachments: 1* cc- Financial Adviser - Bahrein.

Yours very truly CR:LAOctober 7, 1939 PORTLAND CEMENT PRODUCTION IN BAHREIN This report attempts to enlarge the results and carry out the recommendations of the report by Mr*T*E* Harriss on 'Portland Cement Resources of Bahrein, June 20, 1939 w , which supplemented reports by Mr. C. R. B. Hopper (May 28, 1939, 'Manufacture of Portland Cement at Bahrein) and by Mr. A. F. Pyrah - (June 10, 1939, 'Investigation of Various Rocks with a view to Manufacturing Portland Cement'). Work carried on by the present writer over the period from September 7, to October 1 , 1939 consisted of locating and sampling any likely looking formations on the island with particular attention being paid to the feasability of extraction of the material in those for mations as well as to the quantity of material present. All samples were turned over to Mr. Pyrah whose report is included. For a very complete report on the needs and costs of a small plant such as contemplated here see the copy of the report sent to CASOC by the San Francisco office on the subject of a Portland Cement Plant for the King of Saudi Arabia. Portland Cement, by definition, is the product obtained by finely pulverizing clinker produced by calcining to an incipient fusion an intimate and properly proportioned mixture of argillaceous and calcareous materials with no addi-' tions subsequent to calcination except water and calcined or uncalcined gypsum. Repeated testing and years of manufactur ing usage has set the following as the limiting specifications for the chief components making up a commercial cement. CaO 60 - 64.5 $ SiOfc *0 - 24.0 # AlgOs 5 - 9.0 # Fe 2 03 2 - 4.0 # MfeO 1 - 4.0 % SO 3 1 - 1.75 % Calcium, silica and alumina must be kept at the above ratio to manufacture a commercially acceptable Portland cement. Some more iron may be allowed to replace alumina if a quick setting under water cement is desired but most authorities agree that magnesium in amounts over four percent causes a cement to check and crack due to an increased expansion and contraction. These limits when compared with the composite chart of all analysed Bahrein rock samples from usable sources give a rather discouraging view to the manufacturing of cement here:a D Sheet #2 analyses of rocks by refinery laboratory Sample No. J&gt; CaO fo Si0 2 °J&gt; AI 2 O 3 % FegOg % MgO % SO 3 A* 14 66 7.2 H* 79 5 1.0 High I* 50 16 N.D.

R. B. Hopper A glance at the above chart will show that there are only two samples, numbensA and G- 6 , which might be considered and they cannot be mixed together, in any proportions, to conform to the required specifications. The actual search for material for the manufacture of cement in Bahrein consisted in examining first the rim rock and its attendant cliffs, samples were taken wherever it was thought material might be economically quarried, then the area surround ing the rim rock was examined particularly for shales and a number of samples were collected. Samples from each locality were then ground and proportionally mixed and turned over to the Refinery Laboratory for analysis. The analyses returned by the Laboratory have proven fairly conclusively that Portland cement manufacture in Bahrein is not practicable on a commercial scale. It is possible that small individual units of some of the limestones and shales might give a satisfactory cement mixture but no unit of any extent whatever has been left unsampled and unanalysed.

It is said that scattered wells have been drilled in the area south of the refinery in the post; but there is no record of formations penetrated, salt contents of waters {except that they were extremely salty) nor even of locations, Th©re has been a drop in static heads of wells, over a period of years, and it would seem that the rat# of drop is slightly less in the last two years than previously* The Company should continue observations in the refinery »rm and at Zella&lt;|« It Is believed that possibly because of formation changes and porosity differences, the structurally higher EeHnq and Refinery area wells will probably show a faster rat# of drop than wells in the north and north-west part of the island.

The upper 30 feet or so of this third limestone body is the portion We are interested in, end it will be known as Water Zone B C W * Areal Zxtmt i There is a belt at a low elevation around the outer edge of the island within which {with the possible exception of a atrip along the southeastern shore) it is possible to obtain water from at least a portion of th? three zones described in this report. How far inland this belt extends is not known exactly, although it is probable that the series of springs and shallow wells which irrigate the date gardens farthest inlaol define roughly its innermost edge. The information now available does not permit determination as to whether this edge is limited by the water heed or by the pinching out of the individual water bearing horizons. Water Zona W A** ; Within the limestone body which has been designated as Zone n ”, there are ordinarily two producing intervals, although where this section is thin, as at ZellftQ**, there may be only one, and at Tfesa Babas® where the section Is thick, we have three such intervals. Thee© are water© of low static head and they do not always flow.Since the deeper Zone n B n is usually the goal of drilling water wells, there is very little information3 as to how much water Zoae *'/*' wo«M prodaoa if put on the pump or simply allowed to flow for a considerable time in th@ mannar in which the lower formation is produced, A simple comparison of visible rate of flow of this water with the fl&lt;m from Zorn is not very encouraging, but a pumping test might be very enlightening. Two fair examples of the occurrence of these upper waters were observed in Zellaq water well #2 and in Umm Sabaan, At Zellaq, water flowed from the time the hole was 30 feet deep, This flow was at first slightly brackish, but as tbs hole cleaned out, became fresh. There was no change until the large flow was encountered at 97 feat in inter Zone *B W , At Umm Sabaan, a srmll flow of water was encountered at 63 feet, just under the top of the limestone body. This water had a static head of 3 feet. At 81 feet, a good flow was obtained which increased until a depth of 8 T feet was reached. From 85 feet to 115 feet, there was no increase, but at 115 feet water in creased slightly. The well then flowed 109 barrels per hour, with a static head of 7 feet 3 inches above ground level. This water tested 1750 parts per million of chlorides. At £?2? feet, Zone m n n was topped and the flow increased to 1,000 barrels per hour, with ® static heed of 13.6 feet above ground level. This water tested 1450 ppm. HsCl. It is not unusual to obtain water from the top of a limestone body which is overlain by a shale, as is the case of the first waters In Zellaq and Umm Sabean. uch occurrences may be anticipated to some extent• In the case of the other waters noted In Urn® labaan, one is confronted with slightly different conditions in that there is no visible shale break above* them, although assuredly there is some sort of i per vious bed to confine the waters. Similar water horizons within Zone n * w are found at the Portuguese Fort m6 in the Balya well on huharraq 5 but in the different wells, the waters aopear at different points within the limestone body. One is thus forced to the conclusion that the body is a single unit within which waters are confined at various points entirely because of local difference in porosity. It is evident that to try to anticipate these occurrences would be very difficult, if at all possible. It is conceivable that if data were available on enough holes, some order might assert itself in these occurrences. The waters of Tone 'A' seem to follow rather well on a comparison of quality, with the waters of zones below. In ureas sihera on© Is good, generally the other is good also. In the south part of the island where the water from below is very bad, the water in Zone F,* is even worse. Water Aon© w 8 »s Aster Zone *B W occurs at depths of from 100 to 300 feet and Is overlain by a shale which runs from 25 to SO feet thick, usually yellow in color. The zone is generally recognized by the quantity of water which flows fro®, it and the increase in head over waters above. Also, the formation is usually so friable that small cryatalliaa fragments of limestone continue to flow out in the water for some time after the horizon Is penetrated. It has definite characteristics under a micro- scop® which would add nothing to the layman♦s appreciation of it and4 therefor need not be enumerated here, This zom produces the bulk of the water on ■-•ehrein Island* 3o fsr &amp;# is know v this horison is everywhere present around the edge of the island with the possible exception of » portion of the east side south of litre, and furnishes water in drilled wells from Sitra around the north end of the island and to a point several kilometers south of Zellaq. Information is scant from Zellaq around the south tip of the island and back up to Sitra. The formation was reco,^ nizable at r tes al Barr although no definite production of water was observed from it* At t?js® Mattala between Zellaq and z&amp;s si Barr, there are only a few scattered samples and random*bits of information; ’but it is almost certain from what there i® that conditions at Unm Mattala are much the same a© at Has al Barr* There is no positive information at all from Baa al Barr up to Sitrn, but at Sitra Zone 'B' is a?ain producing satisfactory volumes of water, although the salt content is relatively high* T &gt;!0 inconsistencies of this fcration are easily seen, but it rewaine by far the moat prolific source of potable water on the island. There are more or less definite areas where it can be depended upon to furnish groat Quantities, and. for this part of the rnrld, excellent qualities of water, **ator Bone Tatar Zone ”(T is usually found from 150 to E00 feet below Zone although in some instances this Interval may decrease to as little as 100 feet. The zone often produces volumes of water eomjmrsble to those Os one f, and with nearly tbs sarat static head; but the quality is seldom, if ever, ns good. There are very few wellr which are definitely known to be producing from this horizon; but in wells on which there is information, the water often has a strong hydrogen sulphide odor. Salt contents where information is available, are usually higher in this zone than in zones above. Specifically, there are wells on the north and west sides of the island which we suspect have penetrated this formation, and which do not show an unduly high salt content; os for example, a well located some six kilometers north of 'Zellaq and reported belonging to the Secretary to His Highness Sheikh Sir Hamad. On the other hoa!, Rae ©1 Barr and Than Mattala are excellent examples of a combination of high salt content and hydrogen sulphide in water from this zone. These wells might be excluded on the grounds that they are in the area which geographically is without any good water; but at Fasht al Jarirs we have a case of good water in all horizons down to Zone 'C', but the same combination of high salt content and hydrogen sulphide from this horizon. The safest attitude towards this von© is to disregard it as m source of water except as a last resort. -ZTALTTT Of %,\TKR8 ft is importeat to note that although there is considerable varia tion in the quality of water obtained in various parts of the island, there does seem to be some system to the variation. In the Bttra-Malamir area, salt contents of water rim around 4 to 5 thousand parts per million withI L i * only 7oaa w 4*» and ?*Qnm 'B* op^n. On the nm'th and of Sitrn Island, salt con touts run from 29B3 down to 1989 ports par million. One con only guess from volume of flow and from gansral practice, that /xme and Zone 'B** are open in these wells. The volume of water and static head are such as to suggest that this Is true. From scanty facts and local resorts, we see the salt contents continue to drop gradually as we go around the northeast corner of the island and on to the west. At the Portuguese Fort, analysis shews 1504 parts per million with all three sonea open. There was no noticeable production of water from Zone ”0” In this well and no appreciable change In salt contents as the hole went down, so clearly Zone M 3* dominates the production in this hole regardless of both other zones being open. Westward, at Bediya, there is a well, the water analysis of which shows 1316 parts par million of chlorides. This is the lowest salt content of which there is a record for this type of well. As one goas south from Bediya, figures show that the salt contents are rising again and by the time Zallaq is reached they are up to 1700 ppm., with zones , *A’* and W 8 M open. In the new gardens south of Zellaq, chloride contents run from 1696 ppm. in the northernmost wells, to 8047 in the southernmost. This scheme is purely geographical so far, and the picture is simply one of increasing salinity southwards, with the more rapid increase on the east side of the island. Hxere is some indication, aItho no definite proof, that structural position may have some influence upon tbs quality of water. In certain instances, structural position and quality of water appear directly related although the relationship baa not the const tency of the geographical comparison by any means, bather this is significant or not remains to be seen. STATIC H&amp;AP OF ^.XLS &gt; In some cases there has been, over a period of several years, a notable drop in static head of wells producing from Zone *B W . There is not a ^reat deal of accurate information on this score, but in the vicinity of Zellaq and in the refinery area, son® records have been kept. In the refinery srea, wells at Sitra and at Malamir offer the best examples for obsarvin,; normal conditions, since wells at the refinery proper are operated under conditions that make observation difficult, ells at Zalamir, over the reewnt period since September 1938, when regular observations were begun, register no definite drop in head. Measurements show that recent observations are within a tenth of a foot of the highest observed in the two year period. The measurements show a series of ups and downs, but they are all within the range of what is now recognised as tidal influence. In other words, the static level of the wells goes up when the tide is high and drops when the tide is low. Since these recent figures are recorded without reference to tidal diffe rences, there i^ever^reason to believe that all the differences recorded in this two year period ere simply differences in tidal influence. In a recent twenty-four hour test, it was found that the static level of water*»§&gt;«* Well #9 at ’ f ol«B8ir varied as much as 0*81 ft, from high to low tide. Whan on© considers the original head of tha wall whan completed in June 1936, as related to the present water levels, a definite drop is apparent. Comparing the original head of five feet with the ‘noat recent figures, reduced to the am© datum, it is found that the static level has dropped between 1.74 and £.33 feet. These limits are mads necessary by the f*ct that the original measurements did not consider the tidal influence. On this basis, a fi gure of 0.435 to 0.587 feet per year drop in static hoad is calculated. At Sitra Tanks, kater ell #5 shows a smaller rat© of decline. This well was reported as having a head of three feet on its completion March ££, 1936. teemt observations show that there is 1.02 of a foot variation in this wall due to tide influence. On this basis, a drop of from 0.31 to 1.33 feet is calculated from March 1936 to July 1940, or a yearly drop of 0.0715 to 0.307 feet. If it is assumed that the rate of drop will remain similar, this well will flow above ground level from 9 to 38 years. Malandr Water Well ^9, using the same method of calculating, will flor above ground for 6 to 8 years. In all likelihood however, other factors remaining the same, this life span should b© lengthened by a alight drop In rate of decline as the head drops and less water is produced. In tha vicinity of 'iellaq, records have been kept on a number of wells over the last year, but only on th© Company water wells at Zellaq Pumping station are there records over a sufficient length of time to show any great amount of decline. Over a period of 7-3/4 years, from July 1932, until April 1940, th© rate of drop in head on ^'ater ell r*$ at Zellaq has been one foot per year. By using the figures from July 11 , 1939 to April 1940, a figure of 0.5 foot per year is obtained. Water Well -15 shows a slightly smaller rets of decline. Prom its completion in October 1936, to April 27, 1940, It showed a drop of 0.786 ft. per year, while over the sa?ue period, ' atur Tell |2 declined at tha rate of 0.9 ft. per year. From July 1939, to April 1940, 15 has declined at the rate of 0.4 ft. per year. Other wells in the general area which have been measured over the last year, show a rate of decline of 0.88 ft. per year when six repre sentative wells are averaged. Tt must be noted that all of these figures are subject to correc tion, since none of thorn taka into account the variations which o-cur in the heads due to tide influence. ‘This difference due to tidal influence is approximately 0.5 ft. in the only well in that area where it has bean measured; but until more information on that point can be gathered, it is necessary to consider the figures available. There are three main points of consideration for the data at hand. First, a rate of decline over a period of 7-3/4 years which is probably higher than th© present rate of decline. Second, a rat© over a shorter recent period which is half the first and possibly too low. In the third place, there is the average rate for six wells over the last y»ar, and this figure of 0.88 ft. peryear sauna to be the most logical choice for a working figure on the present rate of decline, although one must still consider its limitations due to tide. As already mentioned, there has been actually measured at Sitra and at 2ell*q, differences in static level of the water of 1.02 ft. and 0.5 ft. respectively, within one tide cycle, ■'here la some reason to believe that on tha north end o* the island there is a variation of a foot or more due to this tidal influence. Those differences must be taken into consideration if an accurate rot© of drop i« calculated. There are very meager data on wells on the north end of the island, but it has been observed that wells which are low structurally, have relatively high beads. Consequently, these wells on the north end should maintain their water production batter than wells to the south which are higher structurally. FH:B PHIL HURRY. Bahrein, September 25, 1940D.O. Mo.

C/S68 dated the 1st April 1340 in regard to the Bahrain Water Supplies ? 2* I enclose herewith a copy of a report on the water resources of Bahrain which has been made by the Oil Company. Investigations have not proceeded over a sufficient period of years to enable really definite conclusions to be drawn, but the report discloses a situation which is quite sufficiently alarming* I had always hoped against hope that the deeper water zone (described as zone 'C' in the report) would provide a fair reserve of good water for Bahrain for the future but that hope has now been destroyed. o* There is only one effective way, to my mind, of dealing with the water question in Bahrain, and that is to put locked valves on all artesian wells* There should be a committee to examine and report on the minimum quantity of water required at different seasons to irrigate land already under cultivation; and a water conservancy staff should be appointed to open up artesian wells for a sufficient period each week to provide that minimum quantity* Unfortunately this is Utopian. The worst offender so far as water wastage is concerned is Shaikh Hamad himself, ardently supported of course by the unpleasant gentry to whom he has given gardens and lands, and I see no possibility of ever convincing him - until the water runs out - that we cannot rely indefinitely on the benevolence of nod to maintain an unlimited supply of artesian water in Bahrain. Tie can / The Hon*ble Lleut-Coionel C* U* prior, C. I * &amp; , J. # JD* , Political Resident in the Persian uuif, Bushire*c an, I think, only hope that there will not be too serious a drop in the static head before Shaikh Hamad leaves us, and be prepared to call on the next Shaikh to introduce some such .1 system as X have suggested above. Meanwhile I have myself continued in season and out of sec son to drag the water question into any conversation with members of the Al Khalifah Family and I will advise Alban to carry on with this. I am also writing to Belgrave, to whom a copy of this report nas been sent, to draw his attention once more to the seriousness of this problem, to urge on him the maintenance of strict pro hibition on new drilling and to propose that at the least the flow from artesian wells in the Manama Municipal area be carefully restricted once the new Town V r ater Supply Is ready. (That scheme provides for linking a certain number of wells - three in the first instance - to flow into a central reser voir and pumping therefrom to ail parts of the Town either direct or via a high-level tank according to the season)• From now onwards drilling should be confined strictly to genuine public need, i.e. in the way of providing drinking water for the towns. 4. In saying that the report discloses a serious situation I do not mean to suggest that I foresee any likelihood of the whole artesian source expiring in the immediate future but the impression one gets rs that 15 or 20 years hence the static head will drop to the point where pumping becomes necessary. yours sincerely.D# 0.

Zellaq Water Supply Dear Mr. Belgrave, Attached is a study of the Zellaq Water Supply compiled by our Petroleum Engineers. Several times in the past you have asked for information on this subject and we are herewith submitting a review of the water situation on the Zellaq side of Bahrein Island. Would appreciate any comments you may have regarding the possibility of reducing the loss of irrigation water to the sea as, in course of time, indiscriminate use will affect not only the company^ supply of domestic water but also the Sheikhs 1 supply for irrigation. Yours very truly, THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED MHL:SW Attach: 1 cc-HBM 1 s PA New York WPA M.H. LIPP CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVEmmmmm PRODUCING Ty£PAPT,mT November M, 1941 V m. M.R PATiP GGPPLT Th® static head la tha watar producing zones which are the main source of donseetic water a apply for the Island has been decreasing for a number of years- For details of this ?ecrease please refer to l ,; r« r -. .'ulmon’s report entitled ** -star Resources of Bahi'eia” dated ay 11,1941. In particular, the static head in the ricinity of Zellaq has sho^n a marked decrease, and it has been recently unofficially brought to our notice that the owners of the gardens whose wells hate been affected attribute the consequent reduction in water production to the fact that the Company obtain water for field and domestic use from wells sunk in this area. Although we do not contend that production of wster for Company use will in no way affect other wolls producing from the same source, v© believe that the volume of water involved is so small in comparison with the large velum©a produced for irrigation purposes in the same area that its influence on the static head would b© almost negligible. In a narrow strip of coast line extending for approximately t miles north to approximately 2 miles south of ^©llaq there are more than 40 wells, many of which are not even provided with a control gate. The water produced by these wells is estimated at approximately half a million barrels per day, a large percentage of which flows into the sea from, drainage ^itches. In order to ascertain the volume of water running into the sea, a survey was conducted November 2 and 3, 1941, along the coast line under discussion and the actual flow of water in the drainage ditches was measured. The data obtained is attached in tabulated summary and detailed form and the approximate locations of the ditches referred to in the tabulation are shown on the accompanying sketch map.Thd flow of water in tha drainage ditohes was datarmlned by select lag a ra&amp;ch of uniform oroas-sactioo, measuring the width of the ditch and the depth of the we tor and determining the yelooity by timing a surface float over a measured distance by means of a stop-watch* In calculating the rates of flow from thee© figures it has been assumed that the mean velocity of flow is 0*8 of the surface velocity (a consarvativ® coefficient}* :ater samples were obtained from the drainage ditches for salinity determination and, whore possible, water samples were also obtained fro?- the source of supply in order to observe the amount of salt taken uo into solution during the passage of %ht water through the gardens* These data are else shown in the attached tabulation of results* 'his Investigation has revealed the fact that over £00,000 barrels day of water was running into the sea from the various ditches at the time measured and, although a certain amount of salt is picked up by the water, that the salinity is such that it is still suitable for irrigation purposes. Tha amount of water taken from Zollttq walls for Company opera tions is approximately 13,000 bbls day, which, in comparison with the amount of water wasted, is very small, any of the 40 wells referred to above have been drilled within recent time and the marked decline in static heed apparently coincides with the extensive cultivation which has developed in this area. The flow of water through the porous media of the water bearing strata, whether to a single well or to a number of wells in m area, must be accompanied by tha establishment of a hydraulic gradient to promote that flow. The hydraulic gradient depends upon the rate of flow and a state of ©quilibrittrc will be attained for any one rate cf withdraws*!* Sine© the static head of water et source cannot be altered it naturally follows that the static head in the area of influence must be reduced and that the greater the rateof wlthdrewal thv greater the roduction in static U^d. In the ?.ellaq area It is avident that the rets of water with drawal is such that the hydraulic gradient necessary to promote the flow in the porous madia has resulted in a reduction of static head in that area to a point where sorse of the existing wells, once prolific, will not flow, or at least flow at a very much reduced rate. The drilling of other wells to offset this reduced rate of flow will only further reduce the static head, will undoubtedly encourage greater west® and result in existing flowing walls being further reduced in productivity. leted at Subiliyat, another situated less than a mile north just baen started and, ws understand, a third well is to be pf Tellaq. bis latter statement is emphasized because one new well has Original Signed By GODFREY ??• oovrmrConfidential D•C #No #0/1143• Dated the 8th December 1941.

Ho. 2380/19 Bahrain, December 9, 1941 Dear Alban, Reference your D.O. 0/1143 dated 8th- December jr about the report on the water situation in the Zellaq His Highness when I received this report. I am afraid it will not have any marked effect. The land in question belongs to His Highness him self and is part of a very large area extending from Sadad down the coast south of Zellaq. His Highness has a document for this land from his father Shaikh Isa. The gardens belong to His Highness and to some of his sons and to certain persons attached to His Highness f s household who were given the gardens byhim at various different times. I have spoken repeatedly to His Highness and the Shaikhs about the waste of water. Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa/Who does not own any land there^is the only person who appreciates the position, he agrees that -water is being wasted. The gardeners themselves have told me that in some cases they had enough water and did not need new wells which His Highness insisted on drilling. I will take up the question with him again on his return, but I think it is a matter in which a letter from you to His Highness or to me (in English and Arabic) would be helpful. If the gardens belonged to any other people it would be easy for the State to control them but under the circumstances it is extremely difficult to obtain any results. area, I enclose copy of a letter which I wrote to Yours sincerely Major r.q. •BLetterto His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad Alkhalifah and the senior Shaikhs. I have received a long report from the Bahrain Petroleum Company which has keen made 'by their water engineer about the Zellag water supply. A copy of this has been sent to the Political Agent. The water in this area has been decreasing for some years. The reason for the decrease of water is the amount of water which is being taken out of the ground in artesian wells between Sadari and Zellag. There are over 40 artesian wells in the strip &gt; of ground extending for approximately two miles north • 1 . *■ - to approximately 2 miles south of Zellaq.. Many of these wells have not been provided with a control gauge. The water produced by these wells is appro ximately i million barrels a day of which a large per centage flows into the sea from drainage ditches. The water was measured by the engineers who conducted a survey of water in that area during the month of November. It appears that over 200,000 barrels of water was running into the sea every day; some of this water was almost fresh and contained practically no salt, from which it would appear that it could be used for irrigation. The engineers state that the decrease in water will be greater as time goes on and that it is likely that some of these wells which now contain water will become dry. Each time a new well is drilled the decrease in water would be hastened. The amount of water taken from the Zellaq wells for company operations is approximately 13,000 barrels a day, which, in comparison with the amount of water which is wasted,is very small. I understand that YOU!- Highness has lately drilled two new wells inthis area and that a third well is to he drilled south of Zellaq. Therefore I am informing Your Highness about this report from which it appears that each time a new well is drilled the water in the remaining wells will decrease. I suggest that a valve should he put on all wells in this area and that the cultivator should he written to not to leave water tunning into the sea. There is no object in putting on these valves if the valves are left open. I hope Your Highness will give this matter Your Highness 1 s serious attention.

After compliments, I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.C-1168 dated 15th December 1941 in which you wrote me about the report received from the Bahrain Oil Co. Ltd. regarding the investigation of the decrease of the flow of water from the artesian wells in the Zellaq area. I beg to inform you that the water which flows to the sea does not, as reported to you, flow directly from the artesian wells to the sea but first irrigates the gardens and then flows as waste water into the sea, and if such waste water remains in the gardens it would be harmful to the palB^and other trees. As regards the fitting of valves to artesian wells I beg in Zellaq area to say that valves have been fitted to most wells/even before your letter was received, especially on wells in gardens belonging to me, my sons and servants, and there is only a small number of wells which have no valves and we have now ordered that valves should also be fitted on these with the exception of those wells whose water flow is very low. There is no doubt that the decrease of water is a matter about which we are all very anxious but we pray to God that it will not happen. U.E.D. 0. Ho.

Z_ Enclo:(nx) H ^9 Extracts from Memorandum entitled 'Water Resources of Bahrein Island' by Mr, Max Steineke, California Arabian Standard Oil Company, dated Bahrein Island. July 15, 1942, INTRODUCTION While waiting for transportation to the United States in the earlier part of July, 1942, the writer spent about a week in field and office studies of the water resources of Bahrein Island. * The following memorandum is a hurried writing on his observations on the problem. Arrangements have been made for Dr. R, A. Bramkamp to write a final report on the structure of Bahrein Island when the present Bapco structure drilling program is complete. In that report the water resources of the Island will be thoroughly discussed and more accurate data on the problem will be available. Extract No.l ^ixER RESOURCES RELATION OF HATER TO STRATIGRAPHY STRUCTURE : On Bahrein Island there are three important water zones and their stratigraphic positions are as follows: 1 . Water Zone A (Miocene - Top Zone A and Top Eocene - Base Zone A). Distribution of this member is variable because of the unconformity between the Eocene and Miocene. 2. Impervious Member - Grey Shale ('Orange Marl') - 30 to 70 feet thick. Wide regional distribution. 3. Water Zone B - Brown Crystalline Limestone - Nmamulitic Limestone. Porous series 100 to 150 feet thick - Regional distribution. 4. Impervious Member - Shark Tooth Shale - 6 to 8 feet thick. Regional distribution. 5. Water Zone C - Chalky Zone and lower beds. Regional distribution. SOURCE OF ''ATER AND PRESSURES - REGIONAL : The sources of the water from Zones A, B, &amp; C are evidently from the Hadhramaut, interior of Arabia, and the Syrian desert. However, it is possible that some of the water from the deeper zones might be coming from Iran, Iraq, etc. However, for the present discussion it is most reasonable to assume that the sources of the water are from the interior of Saudi Arabia. The average regional water gradient rises to the west at a rate of from 4 to 6 feet per mile. In general it might be stated that the intake of the water is from elevations of 1000 ft. to 1500 ft. High pressure artesian wells are not found on the coastal region area of Bahrein because of the inability of the upper Eocene and Miocene rocks to hold high pressures and, therefore, the head is lost along its path of migration down dip.- 2 - Normally at sea level on the east coast of Arabia the static head of the water in the Eocene rocks is from about 35 to 50 feet. However, in areas where there is evidently local leakage the pressure drops below the above average. In the Bahrein region the static head ranges from practically sea level on the southern portion of the Island to about 20 feet in local areas on the north portion of the Island. In the north portion of the Island the static level probably averages around 12 feet. In the eastern Persian Gulf region the pressures in A, B &amp; C Zones may be the same in one area or they may all be different. This evidently depend largely on local porosity of the rocks and the character of the impervious members separating the major water zones. SALINITY OF r ‘ATJR3 - REGIONAL: Zone C Water . - This water is generally high in total salts on the coastal region except on the central portion of Dammam Dome where the water has evidently been sweetened by local intake of fresh water. In the interior of Saudi Arabia near the intake the water is very low in salts - below’ 250 ppm in many cases. Zone B Water . - The salinity of Zone B water varies from place to place. At Has Tanura it is highly saline but from Dammam Dome to Jubail it is sweet - 2000 ppm or less. However, west of Jubail and in the Abu Kadriya region it is highly saline. We have no satisfactory explanation for the erratic regional distribution of the sweet and salty waters in Zone B. Zone A Water . - The salinity of waters from Zone A varies considerably from place to place. However, in general the areal extent of sweet water in this zone is much larger than that in Zone B. For example, sweet water is found in Zone A at Has Tanura and in most of the Abu Hadriya region but Zone B water is highly saline. On the other hand, upper Zone A (Miocene) might be extremely salty whereas basal Zone A is sweet. This is evidently due to local conditions which are caused by intermingling with sea water or solution of salt in the formation in the vicinity. LOCAL 1ATRR CONDITION (BAHRAIN) : Zone C Water . - In Bahrein this water is everywhere too saline to be of domestic value except possibly for cooling purposes. The hydrostatic head is evidently a few feet higher than that of Zone A or B. The Chalky Zone and beds below which contains Zone C water are apparently quite porous and very large volumes of water could be obtained from this source. The data at Bahrein indicate that the water of Zone C is isolated to this zone and that it is stopped from migrating upward by the impervious Shark Tooth Shale. There is a possibility, however, that the thinness of the Shark Tooth Shale has allowed migration at Zone C water into higher horizons thereby contaminating the higher water in the southern portion of the Island.Zone B Water . 5 The Brown Crystalline Limestone - Nmnmulitic Limestone series, which contains B-Zone water, has a very wide distribution over the coastal region of Saudi Arabia as well as over the Bahrein and Qatar peninsula region. The Zone B water is undoubtedly the most consistent source of sweet water over the western Persian Gulf region. However, as stated before in this memorandum, the zone contains highly saline water in many place. In the north portion of Bahrein Island, Zone B contains sweet water generally testing between 1500 and 2000 ppm as sodium cnloride. On the southern portion of the Island the water from the same stratigraphic horizon is highly saline. Extract Ho.2 RELATION OF WATER BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF BAHREIN ISLAND The fact that the static head of the water decreases and also the fact that the salinity of the water increases in going from the northern portion of the Island to the southern portion has been emphasized repeatedly in various previous reports and letters. Tn the writer’s opinion the drop in pressure is due fundamentally to erosion to sea level, or practically to sea level, of the aquifer (water bearing) beds. In other words, the north portion of the Island is bordered by a slightly elevated series of strata which carries the water zones and which forms a horseshoe-shaped fringe around this portion of the Island. The open ends of the horseshoe-shaped fringe is truncated to sea level by erosion and therefore it is open to the sea. Naturally the pressure would drop under these conditions. Furthermore, the sea water would intermingle with the fresh water in the general area where this exposure is present. Tidal effects are noted several miles from the areas where the strata are truncated and exposed to the sea. This is quite obvious in the Refiiffery - Sitra Island district which is several miles north of shore where sea wjater encroaches on the Brown Crystalline Lime aquifer near Ousaila. This tidal effect shows sub-surface surging of sea water to and fro which would obviously cause mixing of the sea and fresh water. In the Zellaq district similar conditions are apparently present but the geology is more obscure here because of the covering of Quaternary sediments in the vicinity. Under these conditions fresher water should be found down dip and the maximum contamination should be found xvhere the eroded edges of the aquifer strata are exposed to the sea. However, where the Miocene and upper Eocene strata are thin the whole aquifer series might be contaminated by sea water. Encroachment of the sea water will undoubtedly continue northward as erosion progresses. This is an extremely slow process involving geologic time and would naturally not affect our operations. However, rapid withdrawals of fresh water would naturally tend to create a flow of sea water from south to north. Here again the question arises as to how fast the withdrawals could be made without drawing in sea water. This would depend on the rapidity of replenishment of fresh water from the northern sector.- 4 - There is no way of estimating how much fresh water is being wasted by overflow through the open ends (south end) of the horseshoe-shaped fringe of aquifer strata bordering the northern portion of the Island. The questions that arise are: 1. Is the weight of the sea water of the southern portion of the Island sufficient to balance the slight head of fresh water of the northern portion of the Island? In other words, is there an equilibrium be tween salt and sweet water in the Island district as a whole? £• Is there a southward flow of sweet water into the sea and thereby cause large scale wastage of sweet water? 3. Is the withdra*val of sweet water in the northern portion of the Island sufficient to create a flow of salty water from south to north? In the writer’s opinion the salt and fresh water have reached move or less an equilibrium throughout geological time, that is as erosion progressed the artesian pressure of the sweet water has been reduced to balance an equal column of salt water. Large withdrawals of sweet water, at present would naturally create a flow of salt water from south to north. Marginal wells, or wells high structurally would naturally tend to draw in salt water more rapidly than wells down dip because the area of withdrawal would be less due to drainage from only a semi-circular area and also these areas would be more excessible to the weathered and cavernous rocks and therefore the surging tidal condition would be more effective. Because of the limited time spent on the Bahrein water problem, the above questions have been considered only hurriedly by the writer and a more thorough study should be made of these conditions. SUMMAjRY AND RSCOMMSHDATI OHS 1. The writer agrees with Oulmon and Hurry and others that there is a pressure drop and an increased salinity in going from the northern portion of the Island to the southern portion of the Island. v The writer believes that erosion to sea level of the Bocene rocks down to the Brown Crystalline Limestone (Zcne-B) has caused the above drop in pressure and the increase in salinity of the water in the southern portion of the Island. Wells down dip or located low structurally have a good chance of containing fresh water except in areas where the upper strata are thin as is the case between the southern part of Bahrein Island and Qatar. 3. Salty water in the southern portion of the Island might be due to the thinness of the Shark Tooth Shale and therefore rendering this impervious member incapable to stop upward migration of Zone-C waters to Zone-B and higher zones. This problem should be studied in more detail.4 . The Buri Anticline and 3uri Syncline are superficial structures probably caused by solution of strata in the Chalky Zone and subsequent slumping of the overlying beds. These structures are believed to have a strong bearing on the accumulation and flow of water on Bahrein Island. The age of the slumping should be carefully studied because this has a bearing on distribution of the types of sediments deposited in any given area which in turn has a bearing on the water problem. 5. The Buri Anticline and Buri Syncline should be mapped as accurately as possible in the field. Because of Dr. R. A, Bramkamp’s thorough knowledge of the stratigraphy of this region he should be assigned to the problem. A thorough study should be made of as many of the native wells as possible of the Bahrein district by the portable electrolog devised by Mr.R.Godfrey. 6. The Bahrein Government should be informed of the careless methods used by the drilling contractors in finishing native water wells. A surface string of about 20 feet is believed bad practice. Over the coastal region of Saudi Arabia, the static head in Zones A and B often varies considerably. Therefore, in many cases there might be flowage from Zone B to Zone A, or into Quaternary sediments. Native wells with small flows or dry holes may have a considerable flow from Zone B to Zone A and thereby causing a wastage of water and needless lowering the pressure of Zone B. Therefore, wells should be either completed as Zone A wells or Zone B wells. Zone A wells should not be deeper than the Grey Shale {^Orange Marl”). Zone B wells should have the producing string set in the Grey Shale and production limited to the Brown Crystalline Limestone Series (Aquifer Zone B). ?. The heavy production from Zone B in the Refinery area and the high structural position of these water wells may affect the static head of Zone B water for a considerable radius from the Refinery wells. It is possible that the water levels of the adjoining date gardens located on the Grey Shale Outcrops might be affected. The Barbura and Kathira gardens are located on the Grey Shales and the water is probably coming up through fractured and weathered zones in the overlying Grey Shale Series. If this is the case a lowering of the Zone 3 water of the general district would obviously affect the springs of these two villages. However, springs in the villages of Shabatha, Xowaikab and Farsiyah are located in the .Vhita Lime Series and therefore should not be affected by the large withdrawal of water at the Refinery from Zone 3. However, lowering of the water level in Zone B might affect Zone A indirectly by drainage and overflow of Zone B waters. This latter possibility is remote and should be considered as only a suggestion. A further study of the geology in the Refinery district should be made and withdrawals of water and their affect on the local water level should be studied carefully. The writer suggests that if the withdrawal of water at the Refinery is found excessive then the production should be reduced and a part of the Refinery water supply should be pumped in from wells farther down dip like those on the northern portion of Sitra Island. 8. The snail withdrawals of water by the Company in the Zellak district should not have any effect on the water wells in the adjoining d€ite gardens. The water resources of Bahrein Island should be studied more carefully. The contents of this hurriedly prepared memorandum should be considered as preliminary and only an outline of the problems to be solved.Shaikh Khalifah recently talked to me at considerable length about the Bahrain water question. I do not know whether he had been instructed to do so by Shaikh SaMan He first of all stated that an unlimited number of wells were being drilled at Q,atii and this was being encouraged by the Saudi Arabian Government. Hr* Anders on previously gave me similar information. Hr.Steineke f s report shows that the drilling of wells at ftatif may affect the water-level at Bahrain but X do not think we have suffi cient data to go on for making any kind of representa tion to His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda. Shaikh Khalifah also alleged that the large amount of water used by Bapco was affecting the water-level* and suggested that they should use sea-water for their machinery. I pointed out that the amount of water used by them daily at £ellaq amounted to about l/l7th of what was allowed to run to waste from the neighbouring gardens. He then said that there were a large number of wells inside the refinery at Sitra, and that as a result of the large amount of water used here the water- level in Sitra had fallen and some gardens 6n the refin ery side had dried up, the poor owners receiving no compensation. X was unable to argue about this as X did not know the facts. He also mentioned that a well had been opened at Sitra with such a large flow of water that the level of the main Sitra spring fell substantially and there was nearly a riot amongst the local inhabitants. This well had subsequently been closed. With regard to the suggested use of sea-water i said that I believed that it was much better for the / machinerymachinery to use sea-water if it was available.

Be^r Wakefield, 1 E. B. I see that the question of wastage of artesian water has not moved very far since I was last in the Gulf, and I should like to go into it again on my next visit to Bahrain. There are one or two points which might he elucidated hy then. 2 . I see a suggestion that it is necessary for the water to run to waste in Zellaq. as otherwise it will harm the areas concerned. This seems an argument that is difficult to sustain, unless it is being run over the land with the specific purpose of getting rid of the salinity. Could you look into this and find out what the position is? 3. I see a reference in the first paragraph of sb-Wh _ . Colonel Hay»s note of 8th September 1942 (of which a copy was sent to you under Residency endorsement No.C/869 of the 8th September 1942) to wells being drilled at (iatif. Can you get any information regarding them, their number and the strength of the flow of water? We might use the argument with the Shaikh that until Bahrain had stopped wasting its own water there was little justification for taking up the question of the Stated wells with the Saudi Government. There can be little doubt, however, that a big development of artesian wells at Qatif would seriously affect the water levels at Bahrain, and we should be fully within our rights in protesting. /'X. lob 4.

As regards the last paragraph, I am puzzled by the reference to sea-water, unless it is used for cooling purposes. I should have thought that even for this purpose it would have been less satisfactory as there will be great corrosion in the pipes but would be glad if you uould let me know what the proposal is and whether anything can be done in this line. 6. I have always been somewhat embarrassed in deal ing with this matter by the fact that the Agency were one of the principal wasters of water. If this is still the case perhaps you could see whether something cannot be done to set it right.uilM I £ SJ V No. FA-593. Awali t November 4, 1942, C.

Dear Sir: The Company has recently drilled an exploratory hole at its tanker loading wharf to obtain further information regarding the geology and hydrology in this area. Also, it was hoped that sweet \\ oter might be located at this ooint. A strata of water has been encountered in this hole which is of about the same quality as Zellaq water and which ' could be used by ships in an emergency. The hole is therefore being completed as a water well for use in Company’s opera tions . In this connection, the Company wishes to know ( ) Would the Bahrein Government raise any objection to the sale of water from this well to ships ? (2) Will the Bahrein Government expect a revenue from the sales of such water * r or your information, ships calling at Sitra anchorage which require water are now being- supplied with water transport: -ed in Dhows from a source near ! uharbaq. This service is rendered by Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co.Ltd., when and at such time the necessary transport is avjlable, at a cost of Fs 4/- per ton. This method of water bunkering is slow and cumbersome and has resulted in numerous delays to shipping in the past. We understand that the situation will be' more critical in the future because Dhows which were formerly employed by Messrs. The Petroleum Concessions Ltd., to carry water to 'atar, have removed their tanks and gone into other services. The use of the proposed water , well will be a vast- improvement and there should be little or no delay to ship ping. Bur records reveal that approximately 3120 torts of water was supplied to ships calling at Sitra anchorage during the year 1942, and that a large number of ships requested water but we^e unable to. obtain it because of the necessary deity in delivery. Bahrein water is not considered good water and is used by ships only in emergencies. Costly treatment is required to produce a really first-class water. The Company will appreciate an early reply to the above questions. v ours very truly, 3d/- W. P. Anderson.

M T s Political Agent, Bahrain. ^!' lH Memo ran dum:- His Highness Shaikh Salman is constantly being requested to waive the ban on the drilling of new artesian wells or the deepening of existing wells. Recently he has been asked by the owners of gardens at Malchieh to allow a new well to be drilled there. The gardens in question belong to the A1 Fadl family and are partly wakf. They used to produce over 100 jillas of dates and last year they produced about 6 jillas. They depend for their water supply on springs in the hills some miles inland which are connected with the gardens by an old Persian water channel. The water in the springs has decreased so much that there is now no flow to the gardens. His Highness is inclined to grant permission for an artesian well to be drilled but before doing so he wishes to obtain your advice. Some years ago an attempt was made to drill a well at Malchieh but no water was obtained. This is not an isolated case, in several date growing districts such as Aali and Buri the natural springs have almost ceased to flow and the date gardens are rapidly dying. It would appear that the decrease in water from natural springs, which used to be the only source of water before the days of artesian wells, is the result of drilling artesian wells and the more wells that are drilled the more rapidly will the natural springs decrease in strength.

There are three existing wells which were drilled may years ago ~ before the sstahUshosnt of the Hsvnl, Base - and no well completion ^orda are available. The wells are located in an area of structural mmtmlf and the control points on our ©ub-eurf»*oe contour isap are too few to mttempt an accurate forecast of the water zoo© depths. In order to obtain the desired information the electric losing of the wells was considered necessary.

The perfseabls member of Zone «k m referred to in the above tabulation is. how ever. a consistent marker and is useful because it apparently indicates the lower limit of the unconformity. Information collected during the drilling of numerous water wells and structure holes show that the hydrostatic head of the water in the water boaring members of the upper unconfotreble section is very mob less than in the lower, eonfonaable section, the water in the water bonr^ strata of this upper section of unconformity is evidently derived fro® the uadcrlying head formations through fractures in Inooripotent soparstip^ members. It follows, therefore, that, in order to conserve the water supply in %on&amp; **A't the upper low head formations should bo cased off in any drillod well In order to prevent the flew of water from the lower to the upper formations u&amp;ich will ccsur svtej if no water is produced at the surface, the water which is transferred to the upper formations in this mssaer bis rely au^pnents the l&amp;rm volume which is known to the be flowing unrestricted into the sea at points where the upper formations are erroded and exposed at, and below, sea level. These point® of leakage constitute the large number of fresh water springs which exist in the tidal -ergins of the TslMids {and below). The production of water from these upper low head formations at locations where the elevation will psiralt the® to flow Is by no means detri mental to the water supply providing wells driUsd at such locations do not penetrate the underlying hi|?h head water. A large number of wells have been drilled on the Island and, through inadequate casing programmes, the upper lower head formations ore exposed to the underlying high head water with the result that the hydro static head over largo areas has approached a state of equilibrium in all strata. This ha® resulted in a higher head in the upper formations (and consequently mre leakage through the natural outlets) and a gtmsrel lowering of the head in the more imort&amp;n* lower formations. A similar condition exists in soils which arc completed to produce trm Zone **A W and Zone *B W . A pressure differential exists in favour of iRNI W B*% and, to prevent iftteOTMttSX migration, all wells should completed to produce from on® won® only* In analysing the data presented in the foregoing tabulation it is evident that the casing In each well is too short to fulfil the coed it ions outlined above for the conservation and most advantageous utilization of the available water supply'. In Well m.l the casing is set at 40* but a number of the water bearing strata in the unconformable section are exposed. Ttm the electric log anomalies it is evident that these strata are contributing to the pro duction of the well and it is doubtful if the casing off of these formations rould be justified unless all other wells in the general area are similarly treated.4 Tke eatings Is Well Hes*S md 9 are extr«3®ly abort. Homally «e wmlA axpaet a hi^ser head is fall Me.8 than is Well Ko.l heeaeae later 7&lt;om n B* has bees penetrated; the fast that this is set so would suggest that water Is being thieved by the fozmtioBS which are eased off in $*Xi %.l# The wmmm 9*tw °t the electrie leg curve for the upper portion of the hole in both «elX Hb.S and veil Mo«3 confirms that this way be the ease. ^e believe that the «»par«tien ef £eas *B W free ^one ^4* is neeessary for the west efficient utilisation of the water supply but unless ell wells ere so completed there is little just if lest len for doing this in *ell Ho.2 except that e slightly higher static head should be wade available. The productivity ef the wells given in the foregoing tabulation are comparable with siailar sells for which ws have Information; there is no indication that the wells require cleaning out. The limiting factor in the volume of water they can produce is ths elevation at which that water is required. The available static head is. as close as we can measure, of the order to be expected in the area under review. The miming of too short strings of casing disclosed by thie in vestigation is by no meims confined to these wells; this malpractice is very prevalent in the Manama area. Bahrein Bovemnont Proclamation dated March 19. 1953 appreciates the danger of the practice and specifies, with reservations, that at least 90* of casing must be run. Tt is not intended to disease this regulation here but we feel that, although it covers condi tions in the geneml areas of Managua and Huhurraq, it does not apply to the entire Island. H# will be glad to afford technical assistance should a revision of this regulation be deeded advisable at any time, m&amp;ry effort should be made, however, to enforce this regulation and to correct any mi- satisfactory well whenever the opportunity permits. *if air H0.1 Ik view of the satisfactory performance of this wall and evidence to the effect that it does not constitute, at the present time, a point of migration from the high head, conformable mambara of Sene •A* into ths low head, unoonformsble members of Zone *&amp;*, it is recommended that the well be left in its present stats. Tt is recommended that this well be completed to produce from mter Same *»* only. Is order to do this it will be necessary to pull tho existing casing, ream the hole to approximately 250* (exact depth to bo determined by sample examination), cement casing at that depth and deepen the hole to approximately 350* to tako advantage of full penetration of Zorn *B*. Caro will hevo to bo taken to place cement opposite the 3©»e 'A' members to prevent miration on the outside of tho casing.

I do not consider present time suitable for suggesting appointment in Commandant of Police. Arrival of European Police (one of whom is Inspector) should make it possible to relilve Adviser^ routine Police work. Moreover, particularly with British Police now forming element, it would be awkward if Shaikh expressed desire that Command of Police should be given to Shaikh Khalifa Bin Mohammed. By P.W.D.

I .-f 3-&lt;f GALLOWAY# ■ 1 0, ©O' Memorandum of conversations with the Adviser - Mr. Eelgrave - and His Highness the Shaikh -- both con versations held on the 4th of August, 1945. 1. The Assist a nt State Engi neer. Both the Adviser and the Sheikh were in favour of this appointment and of its being held by a European. The Sheikh concentrated on the necessity of 'Che appointment so as to get the oil gauging done on a regular basis. But the Adviser thought that the Assistant could understudy Group Capt. Leigh and could also assist him. 2. ■ P.W.D. ENGINEER . Since Khan Sahib Jaffar has taken leave, all the efforts of the Adviser to get him to return to his post after its expiry, have failed. There is, therefore, a vacancy in the P.W.D. Neither, the Sheikh nor the Adviser thought that a European of the 'officer' type is necessary for this post -- at least the Adviser did not and I think the Sheikh will be advised by him in this matter. Mr. Belgrave said he thought some one of the Sergeant type, like a superintendent in the A.M.W.D. , would fill the post well. 3. ACCOUNTAN T. Mr. Belgrave told me that state Accounts were in good order and that no accountant was required. My proposal to suggest the appointment arose after I had studied the corres pondence regarding the accounts of the Electricity Supply Department. They were then stated to be badly kept. Mr. Belgrave now says that they are in order. 4. Re: The 4 Year Plan . The Adviser did not oppose this but showed no particular enthusiasm. He said that to re-site the power station would be a new idea to the Sheikh but that since the Sheikh^,, his /famili-2- famil and the leading merchants were well off as regards electricity and water supply (since most of them have their own artesian wells) the Sheikh was not really interested in this scheme. The Sheikh himself, when i mentioned the plan, treated me to a long discourse describing what a bad lot all the other- rulers in Arabia were and how good he was and how he looked after his people. He did not oppose the re-siting of the electric supply nor the water supply and he agreed generally to road repair and town planning interl^d.iift^his agreement with the usual references to his loyalty to Govern ment, his deep sense of his responsibility as a Ruler, and of his gratitude to His Majesty's Government. After about three was about to crop up. This showed no particular perspicacity on my part as the subject is nearissp to the surface in and out ■ of season. With difficulty I restrained the Sheikh from launching into another of his full dress accounts of his griev ances regarding Qatar. He said 'that he would agree to any plan put up by agents of the British Government' and followed Qatar hactbeen settled'. He left me with the deepest wcproo^l expressions of regard and the feeling on my part that until the Qatar question is settled or is cut out of the political menu in-Bahrain, no progress with Sheikh -Salman is possible. quarters of an hour of this sort of thing, I knew that Qatar - to carry out any plan or indeed to be ji ri at all until V 5.8.1945.V it -URGENT. COiJFIDEI?TIAL&gt; D.O, Ho. P 3. (Camp; Shiraz the 19 th- of Angus ? 1945. My dear Colonel, Will you kindly refer to the correspondence ending with your telegram No, 1/214 dated the 1st August on the subject of Bahrain Development, the projects to be taken up, and staff required therefor? . 2, I enclose a copy of a memorandum of my con- versations with Belgravo and the Sheikh on these subjects. I should add that I mentioned to the Sheikh the desirability of investing the State’s large reserve fund in public utilities where it would get a larger revenue than the present 2% per cent obtained from securities. This Siam (I quote from memory) amounts to about £.800,000. The Sheikh replied that he was afraid of spending it as he feared that the oil fields might be exhausted and the golden stream cease to flow. As far as I know this fear is unjustified since no one is able to,tell the extent of the resources of the Bahrain field. Parenthetically I would add, as Illustrative of the workings of the sheikh’s mind (ox* indeed of any Arab’s), that he is continually urging the oil company to extract more oil and thus to exhaust the field as soon as possible. 3. I should explain that my purpose in putting forward, or rather in re-opening, these proposals in this hurried and necessarily somewhat unconsidered way, was conditioned by the following facts. Belgrave, partly because he refuses to share authority and consequently has more work on hand than ha can do and partly because of his difference in tamperament and his intense opposition to any change, has failed to work harmoniously with Leigh. (For the same i*eason, I am afraid, he will be unable co work harmoniously with anyone not chosen oy himself). Leigh has been given no defined authority and he has no financial powers. Other specific complaints such as inequitable treatment of his employees as compared with other State employees ha has brought to me-officially and I have had to get Belgrave to remedy matters* As regards the larger questions, Leigh has failed to take them up specifically. I think he would give as a reason for not doing so that he has been completely absorbed in work of an urgent nature. This is true since he has been employed almost exclusively in trying to keep going the decrepit power station in Bahrain and in fitting it with a new generator. I’ve mentioned this matter at paragraph 2 of my telegram No. 438 dated the 29th July to you. ^ /These facts.... The Hon’ble Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, O.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, (Camp) Shiraz .i -.2- These facts convinced me that necessary large schemes of development cannot he undertaken irith the present staff. Hence my proposals in this regard. They were made hurriedly because i thought it essential to try to obtain Belgrave’s co-operafcion before he goes on leave at the end of this month. Smith will then take over and will be left with neither the authority, nor perhaps, the ability, to obtain the sheikh’s co-operation in undertaking major schemes. On Belgrave’s return the situation will not have improved and next summer will be a repetition of this one - with no progress to show. 4 , you will see from the memorandum enclosed that as regaTds staff both Belgrave and the Sheikh consented only to fill posts which existed before the war. I may add that since these conversations Belgrave has told me that for P.W.D. work all he wanus is an Indian and he asked my consent, and I rave it, for advertisement in the Indian , ... papers for a man to fill the P.WJX post. The 'Oil gauger- M will, of course, cost the State nothing since his salary will be paid out of the dues levied on Bapco’s buyers for the gauging done for tham, - so that as regards staff we are precisely where we were before the war. Incidentally, when I told Belgrave that Sir Geoffrey prior had offered to obtain a man fox 4 the oil gauging in London, he said that he would do it himself when he went on leave. 5 . The second depressing conclusion which emerges from my conversations is that the Sheikh is attempting to make the settlement of the Qatar question on his terms a condition precedent of any progress in Bahrain. I hope to address you separately regarding this question. All I can say here is that v/o cannot allow the Sheikh to maintain this attitude though it will bo exceedingly difficult to shake him from it and at the same time to get his co-opera tion In major schemes for improvement* As you arc aware, circumstances at the moment make any proposals for radical changes in the Bahrain Set-up out of the question; and I am inclined to doubt whether a real plan of improvement is feasible without such changes. Nevertheless, I have one proposal that may save something from the wreck of my perhaps too ambitious four-year plan. I propose, if you approve, to telegraph through ny office tfc Belgrave. I would state that it is understood that the Sheikh approves of the plan for a pumped water, including drinking water supply. (Steele, the State Engineer, got as far, in Mr. Weightman’s time, as calling quotations for the necessary machinery). I would ask Belgrave to confirm in writing to me that he had left instructions with Leigh before he goes on leave to order the machinery and get on with the project. It would obviously be asking too much to demand ft*om Belgrave plans for Road Repair and Construction and Town planning before he goes on leave. In any case, there is not the sc,afj. to carry them out. ’Alien Leigh has his new generator Installed zhe electric supply, I understand, should at any rate be adequate for the next year or so. It has given such poor service to the Royal Air Force, the Navy, and B.O.A.C. that I am pretty certain that these concerns will shortly instal /their own..,CONFIDENTIAL No. C/210 . Office of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Camp, Shiraz. 22nd August 1945. Will you please refer to^y€ur demi-official letter No. P 8, dated the 19th August 1945, on the subject of Bahrain Development and connected questions ? 2. The action proposed in paragraph 6 of your letter is approved. 3. In addition you could perhaps stress that the removal of the power house to a central site, together with the installation of a suitable plant to avoid the mushroom plants otherwise likely to be installed by the Services, is an urgent matter; that the people of Bahrain, now grown rich owing to various factors, have the right to the attention of the State in regard to their comfort and the provision of the every-day amenities of life, that electricity is one such, and that students and others returning from Egypt will not tolerate miserly tactics when the State is known to be overflowing with money; and that similar considerations apply to road construction and repairs. ~7 \ C.J.

BAHRAIN RECEIPT, ^ . ^ D.O.No. Bahrain, A; /?lj s t 25, 1945. Bahrain State Officials. During the war and especially during the last twelve months the State has lost a number of its senior officials both British and non-British, in many cases these people have not been replaced. 2. At the beginning of the war Mr. Furber was employed as oil Inspector and Assistant to the State Engineer, when the State Engineer was on leave he acted for him and much of the transport work was in his hands. He resigned to take a commission in the Army. 3. The Principal of the Technical School was a British official, Mr. Hutchings. Lately he undertook the work of oil G-auging in addition to his duties at the school which in any case only occupy the Principal during nine months of the year. He went on leave at the beginning of the summer and was to have returned in the Autumn for a short time to continue working as oil Inspector until a permanent man was appointed to this post. He has now sent in his resignation. This is not surprising as the prospect of returning to Bahrain for less than a year under somewhat difficult living conditions was not an attractive proposition. 4. Group Captain Leigh was appointed State Engineer on a two years contract from December 1944. An exten sion of this period is not very probable. b 5. The Superintendent of the Public Works Department, Mohamed Jafar, who was made a Khan Sahib in June 1944, failed to return after spending the summer of that year on leave in India. It became evident that he preferred to rest on his laurels in India than to return to Bahrain. 6. Hussain Effendi, the Egyptian Agriculturist, who was on loan from the Egyptian Government having completed the period for which he was seconded returned to the Ministry of Agriculture in Cairo. While on leave from Bahrain he married an Egyptian lady who he brought here and her intense dislike of the place was the main reason for his not wishing to take a new contract. 7. It is unlikely that the Accounts Officer, Mr. Braganza, who has completed eight years service, will remain much longer in Bahrain. For health and family reasons it is likely that he will soon wish to return to India. 8. I made enquiries from the firm of Redwood, consulting Petroleum Technologists, about obtaining an oil Inspector. The terms which they suggested, which included the appoint ment of tiB firm as Advis ers petroleum to the Bahrain Government, appeared to be extremely high, an annual pay ment of £2,310 and also passages, transport, board and lodging for the Inspector and his wife similar to the provision which is made fcr Bapco officials of his status.The Bahrain Government does not wish to employ a firm of oil consultants but what is required is a man who is capable of gauging the oil, carrying out tests and supervising the measuring. In my opinion and in the opinion of Mr. Anderson this work is not a full time job and the oil Inspector, or Gauger, could usefully employ part of his time on other work. The rate of salary paid by Bapco for a man with qualifications necessary for testing and gauging would be from £75 to £100/- per month. I understand that in Persia tie Government employes as oil Inspectors on behalf of the Government men who formerly belonged to the A.P.O.C. I think it is possible that the A.P.O.C. could recommend a suitable man for this purpose and Bapco would have no objection to this arrangement. I have informed Redwood that their proposals are not altogether acceptable but that I will see them about the matter when I am at home. 9. An Assistant to the State Engineer is required, I think he should be a man who could eventually succeed the State Engineer therefore his chief qualification should be electrical. This again is not at present a whole time job. A new Principal of the Technical School is required as well and it is highly desir&amp;ble that there should be supervision by a British official of the P.W.D. where there is so much opportunity for irregularities. I consider that it would be possible for one man to deal with the Technical School and also to supervise the work of the P.W.D. I therefore consider that the Bahrain Government should now endeavour to find an Assistant State Engineer and a man capable of running the Technical School with experience of Public Works, this in Bahrain consists of buildings and roads buWdoes not include transport or the bridge as these works come under the State Engineer. The present Syrian Headmaster of the Technical School is capable of managing the school under European supervision. The Bahrain Government is now advertising for a P.W.D. Superintendent to take the place of Khan Sahib Mohamed lafar. When replies to our adver tisements are received I will ask your help and advice regarding the applicants. 10. A new Agriculturist is not absolutely essential but the services of a man of this type are useful in Bahrain. Would it be possible to enquire from Egypt or India about candidates? The disadvantage of employing an Indianis the language question. Hussain Sffendi when he left was receiving Ik. 380/- basic pay with allowances amounting to an additional Es. 97/-. 11. Regarding the Accounts Officer, this at the moment is not an urgent matter but when the Government embarks upon big public works schemes the auditing work will increase. His Highness does not favour the employment of an Indian in this post. It might be filled by a local official who has been for many years working in the Government service and who I think would be able to undertake the responsibility. 12. Since starting this letter I have heard that Willey, the new Director of Education, is not returningM *' 3 here, owing to ill-health so yet another replacenient will be required to fill the post Of Director of Education. This matter is further complicated by the fact that Willey went to Cairo to arrange about the hostel for the Bahrain students who are to go to Egypt at the end of September and presumably owing to his illness it will not have been possible for him to deal with this matter. 13. I hope to be in England next month and it will therefore be possible for iib myself to see and to recommend candidates for Bahrain. A local difficulty exists and that is the housing shortage. It has been suggested by Bapco that the oil Inspector should live at Awali.Quarters are available for the Director of Education but at present no accommodation exists for an Assistant State Engineer or Principal of the Technical School unless the new British Police Inspector occupies rooms at the Fort, which have been prepared, instead of talcing over a flat in His Highness T s building previously occupied by the Public Relations staff. 14. I should be grateful for your views on the matters referred to in this letter. C. J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.2., I.C.S., H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.A 4 '* Dear Colonel Galloway D.0. No. C/866. Please refer to your Express Letter No. 3290-19/8 Sub.23. dated the 10th of August, 1945. 2. I enclose a copy of a note recording Bird’s conversation with Belgrave on the subject of the East Anglian Engineering Company’s proposals. Personally, I am inclined to think that it would be better to canalise the State’s requirements from England through one representative - that this would the most expeditious and efficient way of doing things even if slightly more expensive. At present Belgrave is trying to deal with about half a dozen different firms and to do his own work in his various capacities as well. He will not, of course, delegate to Leigh. I understand that he, intends to see the East Anglian Engineering Company in England — I think also that he will have to revise his idea that the number of orders to be placed for machinery, etc., for Bahrain will be small. 3. Regarding what is referred to in the East Anglian Engineering Company’s letter as the ’’State Electricity undertaking” the position is not very satisfactory. It would appear from that letter that Sir Geoffrey prior mentioned the proposal to the East Anglian Representative and was under the impression that we had got further with it here than (I am sorry to say) is actually the case. The position is more or less as stated at paragraph 5 of Bird’s note. I should, add that you may remember that I mentioned it in my Demi-dfficial letter No. P 8, dated the 19th of August, 1945, to you. I am afraid that I^did not take action on paragraph 3 of your Demi-official letter No. C/210 dated the 26th of August, 1945, as I thought (perhaps wrongly) that I should be trying Belgrave too high if I addressed him about the water supply and the electricity at the same time. I shall, however, now see what l' can do with Smith and Leigh to get the electricity scheme under way and out of the realms of being merely a proposal. Meanwhile, you might think well of writing to Sir Geoffrey Prior about it as he will doubtless see Belgrave in England. 4. incidentally, I am glad to say that Belgrave took prompt action on my reference to him about the water supply and has called for quotations for the machinery, etc., from two firms. Yours sincerely * Sd./- C.J. PELLY.TL ( Colonel Prior f s Confidential Demi-official Letter NO.1064-S dated 19th October r 42. *spelling uncertain Para 2 : Under the system of irrigation generally followed in gardens in Bahrain two channels are dug on different levels and these channels serve different purposes. The channel on the higher level, known as ^Sab', i s the irrigation channel proper and carries water from the storage tank (which is fed by the tubc^ to all parts of the garden. The channel on the lower level, known as ^Manejjar”, removes seepage i^e* carries away the brackish water which oozes out of the saturated soil* This water is highly saline and cannot be utilised again for irrigation. I understand, that if these secondary drainage channels are not dug irrigated land soon becomes too saturated with salt to be productive. Water which flows into the sea from these seepage channels is not wasted as, when it flows into the sea, it has performed its function of irrigation and is carrying away deleterious salt. Wastage does occur, however, when gardeners fail to close the valve on the tube which feeds the tank when the tank is already full* When this ha ppens water overflows from the tank and is drained away into the sea without being utilised. Para 3 : The information which I have secured about wells at Qatif is from Dr. Bramkamp, Head Geologist of CASOC. He informs me that only two drillers, employees of the Qosaibis and Kanoos respectively, are working in or near Qatif. One driller cannot complete a well in less than 5 or 6 weeks. The maximum rate at which wells are being billed is therefore 4 per quarter. Dr. Bramkamp informed me that in the coastal area ten miles south of Qatif to ten miles north of Qatif there are not more than 25 to 30 drilled wells. The volume of the good wells ranges from 5,000 barrels per day to 15,000 barrels per day assuming that the flow is continuous. (1 barrel - 42 gallons). Most of the wells have valves.-2- Dr. Braxnkamp said that in and round Qatif there had been as yet no reduction in the water level or in the pressure. He said that the relation of the water supply in Saudi Arabia to the water supply in Bahrain had not as yet been fully determined but he gave it as his view that even if the number of wells in Qatif were increased five-fold water supply in Bahrain would not be affected. In any case, long before water levels in Bahrain could be affected by Qatif withdrawals the water level in Qatif itself would fall substantially. Dr. Bramkamp believes that the catchment or feeder area of the water supply of Bahrain and Qatif is in the Dahina. He explained that the pressure of water was determined by the equilibrium or balance between feed and discharge. In consider ing discharge it is necessary to take into account submarine discharges as opposed to land withdrawals. He gave it as his opinion that submarine discharges, though not capable of exact determination, were land enormous and that the sum of ^withdrawals was probably negligible in comparison with the sum of submarine discharges. Dr. Bramkamp (who was, of course, consciously or unconsciously, arguing the Saudi Arabian case) said that reductions in water pressure or levels in Bahrain could only be due to local withdrawals in excess. Dug wells only penetrate the upper water zone. Drilled wells penetrate the lower water zone. Water from the lower zone undoubtedly seeps through to the upper zone. It is likely therefore that wells drilled into the lower zone will reduce the water available for dug wells which draw their supplies from the upper zone.Paras 4 &amp; 5 ? There are 6 wells inside the Refinery at Sitra* The function of these wells is two-fold - (a) to provide water for boilers and condensers in the Refinery and (b) for fire protection. For the second of these objects the wells are not, of course, normally used, bat the water would be available in the event of emergency. For the first of these objects water from these wells is absolutely necessary. Sea water cannot possibly be used in boilers or condensers on account of corrosion, sediment ation and scaling. Any scheme to use sea water in place of well water in the Refinery is entirely impracticable.
