The map is a cross-section of the depth of the coastal water, in the vicinity of the Sheikh of Kuwait’s coal shed, the position of which is marked. A horizontal line with a marker at intervals along its length, represents actual spots where soundings or heights were taken by HMS
                           Lapwing. Three other horizontal lines drawn across the map represent: the ‘Level of Doorstep of Sheikh’s Coal-shed’, ‘High Water Springs’, and ‘Low Water Springs’ respectively. The map has a vertical scale of 10 feet to 1 inch and a horizontal scale of 30 feet to 1 inch. This map is also described as an accompaniment to Bushire letter No. 1947 dated 8th August 1909. The map bears the following printing statement ‘I.B. Topo. Dy. No. 8,499'. It was executed by C J A in April 1910 and is numbered No. 5,150-I, 1910.</abstract><typeOfResource>cartographic</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Map</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100041294368.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
