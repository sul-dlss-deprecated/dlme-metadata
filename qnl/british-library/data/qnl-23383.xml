I am informed that IftGchudha Aly hin Ja.ssim, a Bahrain subject, left Bahrain about a fortnight ago with a cargo of sugar, loaf-sugar, and tea; and recently found himself in the neighbour hood of Asaloo, a small Persian port. here he tool aboard a number of Persian passengers, some goats, carpets, and a quantity of coin, and set out to return to Bahrain. When about five hours* distance from the Persian co^st, he found that he was being chased by a Persian patrol-boat, which was possibly on the look-out for craft alleged to be smuggling goods out of Persia. Being on the high seas, he maintained his course, and a running fight ensued, which resulted in the death of the Niikhudha Aly bin Jassim, and two of his crew, and the capture of the launch and its contents, which were seized by the Persian petrol-boat, and taken by them to Bushire, while the launch itself was sunk, after its engine had been removed. I hear that the passengers were all Persian subjects. Believe me, Yours sincerely, To: - Hd»eut -Colonel Gordon Loch I.A H.B.M's Political Agent, BAHRAln. irV S-^-3 D.O.No.jffj?.

Dated, R/Thanv •W,1352 August \$ f 1953 H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: I have been able to obtain the following particulars in connection with three motor launches recently captured by the Persian Gunboats. Owners of these launches are:- 1. 2 . 3. Haji Ali bin Marhoon, a Bahraini, residing in Manamah* subject of the government of Bahrain, Mahmood bin Yusuf Jaideh, an Arab, residing in Maharaq^ subject of tne government of Bahrain, and Abdullah bin Khalil al-Hasan, an Arab, residing at Maharaq, subject of the government of Bahrain. Motor launch of No. 1. which was in charge of Nakhuda Yusuf bin Jasim, a Persian subject, shipped from Bahrain the following cargo for Qattar, 160 bags loaf sugar 4 bags Java sugar of approximate value - Rs 1,700/-, &amp; Zo IWa excluding the cost of motor launch which is estimated at Rs 3,500/-. Motor launch of No. 2, which was in charge of the owner himself carried the following cargo for Qattar:- / ^/? .- 2 - &amp; 296 bags loaf sugar 25 bags Java sugar 28 cases tea 3 bundles piece goods and 40 bags loaf sugar . approximate value - Rs 6,000/- excluding the cost of motor launch which will be not less than Rs 3,000/-. Motor launch of No. 3 which was in charge of Nakhuda Jabar bin Mohomed, a Persian subject, carried the following cargo to Persia.- 240 bags loaf sugar 20 bags Java sugar 5 bundles piece goods and 1 case matches ^ . Approximate value - Rs 3,700/-, excluding the cost of motor launch will be about Rs 3,000/-. In the neighbourhood between Tibin and Asaloo they observed a ship which they believed to be one of the Persian gun-boats which generally ply in that neighbourhood for preventing smuggling of sugar and tea to Persian ports. Fearing capture the occupants of the above three launches, with the exception of fee man who was sick, jump^ed into their small boats and got away to the shore to one of the Persian ports. It is said that all the three launches under reference were afterwards taken possession of with the cargo by the Persian gun boats and taken to Bushire. I am also informed that the gun boat opened fire on the launches on seeing them, but this fact is not verified. Adviser to the Government. I*j/ Cm 6+C’s. P.
