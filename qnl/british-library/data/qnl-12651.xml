            900 of 1822) of the Bombay Government, which instructed the Resident to present a
            remonstrance to the Government of Fars against Rahma bin Jauber [Raḥmah bin Jābir]. It
            explains that the Resident does not expect they will act on such a complaint, since the
            Chief in question has declared himself to be under the authority of Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl
            Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat.It furthers notes that a settlement was brokered by the
            Imam between the Chief of Bahrain and Rahma bin Jauber, though the Resident does not
            expect the latter to abide by the agreement.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x000087#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
