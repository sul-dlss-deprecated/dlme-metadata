Khorramsliahr continue d to bo the most inpcrtant port for the irrport and export of cargo, due to the convenience of a railhead from ICiorramshaiir lea-aing to the hinterland. Early in the year, there wa* a serious oonjestion in the Customs of in-coming cargo, owing to the lack cf an all-weather road to Ahwaz, an insufficiency^ tf rolling stock, the inefficiency of the railway authorities and the slow clearance of goods through Customs. As a result the port load to be closed temporarily. By the end of March the gorges fcion was greatly relieved and the port was re-opened, Ii-provemontft-are now being put in hand in the Customs area, whore the yards are being asphalted and new go downs and sheds are being erected. The railway to Ahwaz runs sdoi daj^s in the week and, as the Customs authorities insist on i! passavant n goods for Tehran being transmitted by rail, a good deal of money is mace on freight by the railway, which is the main and most convenient means of transport. Merchants have a good deal *f difficulties in their dealings with the Customs authorities, who are out to make as much as they can cut of them and therefore raise innumerable difficulties when cargoes are being clears •! or shipped.

The latter was inclined to object at an agreement recently concluded by Mr. Bird with tho Al bu Shamis tribe whereby the tribe v/ill allcfvr the company to carry out explorations in their territory for throe years in return for an annual payment, but it is reported that an amicable settlement was eventually reached. (ii), Muscat’s reactions to tho termination of the British Mandate in Palestine were extremely mild. There is no Jewish corxTunity and no large hooligan element amongst the local population. Deprived of these raw materials for a riot, Muscat remains calm. Even the Palestinian Arabs in the population, soon to bo able to discuss the Palestine question objectively. (iii). It is understood, however, that Hassassi, the Palestine Wall of Matrail, suggested to the Sultan that he should start a local collection on behalf of the Palestine Arabs. His Highneas is believed to have with held permission, no doubt through his desire not to incur His Majesty’s Government's displeasure by becoming officially involved in the Palestine issue and partly, we think, lest Rasa as si should use his official position to press large contributions out of the local mercliants, most of whom are quite content to leave the Palestine Arabs to look after themselves. 37.

Ho was accompanied by Shaikh Zaid Bin Sultan Bin Zaid, and had come to Muscat to report to His Highness on the results of his work in Baraimi, and of his successful nogotiiiiam with tho Al Bu Shamis and Bu Khuraiban (Na*im) tribes. It is reported that His Highness was greatly perturbed with tho Company's direct approach to the tribes and objected to the procedure followed by them fearing his jrcstigo, such as it is, in tho interior would be overshadowed by Biri , s private contact with the Shaikhs of tho interior. (li&gt;. Considerable payments wore made to tho above-named tribes for permission to explore parts of the interior for three years extendable to five years should the Company doom it necessary to do so. In the meantime yearly payments will bo made. (iii).

One issue, which contained an appeal by Rosa Rust a to workers to contribute a day’ pages to the Central Party Fund, was distributed in largo numbers in the Abadan town. Subsequent issues fm of the paper reported that there had boon an excellent response to the appeal. (iv) Tudoh coll meetings wore hold regularly and almost exclusively in the Ahmednhad area. Some open-air meetings are also reported to have taken place in the Bahmnsliir Oasis, under tho guise of picnics. A 'whispering campaign' is reported to have been initiated recently by the Tudch party to tho effect that attempts are being made by the British to prevent tho cultivation of tho fertile lands of Khuzistan in order to ensure tho supply of labour to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (v) On August 3rd, a mooting was held in the office of tho local repre sentative of tho Ministry of Work and Propaganda in order to, elect a delegate from, this area to the International Labour Union.

(Rashtrya Seyak Sangh) group, in Abadan, , It will be recalled that the R.S.S* organisation oano into the limelight in India in connection with tho assassination of tho Mahatma, Gandhi and that it was subsequently declared illegal by the Government, its branches all oyer the country being closed down and its loaders arrested. The local R.S.S. group is reported to have been established, by an Indian named Phatak, who has boon holding mootings regularly in the private quarter;.; of members, of tho group. Tho object of its establishment in this area is difficult to understand, but inquiries regarding its activities are being made.'tr -3- 5EOR3T.

Agliai Jalal licwaqqar has ‘boon endeavouring to interest the Khorramshahr norchants in a schcne to establish a shipping company to run cargo ships ’between the Persian Gulf and Moditerranoan ports.. It is said, that he lias obtained, an offer from an Italian Shipping Company to, take up h-9/ 0 of the shares and to look after the technical sido of the project,, and that the remaining 5X.o of the shares will bo hold by a combine) of Iranian merchants. The Company will bo registered as an Iranian _ . concern. . A mooting of the loading Iranian merchants in this, area was held in the Chamber of Commerce at ICiorransho.hr on August 3rd at which Mewaqqar outlined his scheme 'for the non op sly of Persian Gulf shipping”, which envisages the purchase of surplus war quality ships from the U«S*A* and the immediate payment by the, share-holders .of 25/o of the capital. The merchants were not, however, able to give him any decision at the meeting. It is said that, apart from having feeling that the schcne is a little too ambitious, thotfaro dis inclined to associate themselves with Kewaqqar in any kina of financial project in Mow of the losses which many if thorn have sustained in former dealings with him.

Vice^-Consul, in his unofficial capacity as an anthropologist (p.R.A.l) has obtained permission from the Governor of Bushire to visit Kharg Island nnd_ study remains of alleged.. Zoroastan origin there. The visit will be made later in the season when building operations have proceeded a bit further and some idea can be gained as to their nature and purpose. (ii) Quite apart from its present day significance., Kharg is of considerable interest arohaeologioo.1 ly and historically. Wo ourselves made an unsuccessful attempt to capture it in 1768, five years after the British Flag was hoisted over the first Residency at Bushirej an . attempt in which, in. spite of our resolve to broach the nopth curtain of the fort and, storm it with landing'parties from the 'Revenge 1 /and other ships of the East India Company,Mho enemy I.lir Mahnna, who had recent ly expelled the Butch stood firm and our three hours 1 bomb ardment produced no effect cn the fort.

She is comjiandod by Captain (Colonel) Mushkin Nafas. The expeditions of the 'SHfJIRmai' are made in conjunction with the Coastal Guard on. shore. The new Officer Commanding the Guard hero (and concurrently Bushiro Garrison Commander), in succession to Lieut-Colonel Sharif, is Colonel Carab Mukhtari. He is said to.be, a 'strong' nan, and local nisoMof-makers are looking forward maliciously to’the first tost of strength between Mm and the Governor.

At this mooting, most 'of the strikers* demands were deferred for future consideration. Meanwhile, tho strike committee found it has lost a 1ft of its support, as tho 400 Indian employees who had offered their resignation as a protest were surprised to have their resignation accept od and -.any asked hurriedly to withdraw their original application. There was half hearted talk of calling out the strikers again but no real attempt was made. The General Manager stated that oil production was not affected. (iii) Approximately 15 of the ringleaders have subsequently boon discharged and shipped to India, (iv) Three fires occurred during September, two in the Town and *ne in the IC.0,0, Motor Transport Stores at Magwa. Tho latter was suificiently serious to affect K.0,0, development programme, aggravating still further, thoir very uncertain transport situation. Of^the two fires in the Town, one was in a c&lt;a.Tpmmd full of stores and the other oceurrod in two booms on the sea-front at low tide. In both cases the fire brigades were helpless because of lack ff' water,and the fires were allo^.’od to bum out. In an^r case fire fighting is not helped by the vast concourse of passive spectators, who seem to regard fires as one, of tho major amusements of Kuwait. The fires in tho t own were probably due to carelessness and the high cembustibility gf materials after a dry summer, but a court of enquiry found, tho K*0.C* fire was duo to arson, either wanton or to cover up thefts.
