Kemball acknowledges receipt of Malet's letter and the Court of Directors' despatch. Kemball discusses Sheikh Sultan ben Suggur's [Sultan bin Saqr] objection to the new system of compensation, fearing that it would be easy for him to retaliate against others on his own terms.Kemball encloses two translated extracts of letters from Hajee Yacoob [Hajji Yaqoob] the British Agent at Sharjah, addressed to himself and dated 11 November 1852 (folio 205) and 29 August 1853 (folio 206) respectively. In each extract Yaqoob writes of Sheikh Sultan's displeasure at compensation being paid to directly to the victims of piracy and not to himself. This, suggests Kemball, indicates that the 'irritation' of Sheikh Sultan towards this system has 'in no degree diminished' over time.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x00003a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
