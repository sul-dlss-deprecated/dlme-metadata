The Admiralty feel that there is much justification for t|ie^views expressed on behalf of the Company. We suggest |that it might he made clear in the exchange of letters that we should regard any transfer of control to foreign or other American interests as a matter which affected Hie Majesty's Government's (£0 special interests in the Gulf, and therefore is*-m matte** on which the Company should consult His Majesty*s Government in advance as soon as the proposals arise. I am sending copies of this letter to Starling and Eendel.^ sincerely, EaJ l. *£PT- 1 . M.J.Clauson, Esq*, India Office S.W.1. 2 6 MAY1937 -FlCEMr. Ballantyne called on 14th April and discussed the request made in Mr. Walton’s letter of the 14th July 1936 for certain assurances in regard to the control of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. (A copy of this letter was circulated to the interested Departments on 15th July, 1936, and sent hy air mail to the Government of India, Bushire and Bahrein on the 12th September 1936). Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company had given this matter careful consideration and quite sympathised with the feelings of H.M.G. as expressed in the earlier part of the letter. They were anxious to give some assurances to H.M.G., hut they did not feel that they were in a position to give the specific assurances requested. They left it to Mr. Ballantyne to work out something which would he satisfactory to H.M.G. and which would also he possible for them to subscribe. He explained that there were following objections to the specific assurances suggested. In the first place the Standard Oil Company of California and,the tfo AM C4\**/&gt;***M Texas Company aie parent companies and no control can be ) exercised over dealings in their shares. Any Ayfovi&amp;v'Ci 4at^nferenee&gt; by the Board of the Bahrein Petroleum Company could not prevent changes in the control of the parent companies and therefore an assurance of the kind suggested would not be of very much use. Secondly, the Board of the B.P.C. would not feel able to give an A unqualified assurance of the kind suggested, principally because, while the present Articles of Association of the Company give the Board complete control over movements of/ ;, vaac ml &lt;h/fod- tt*** tAV U* fcnfo** \JhtMjfiA fj (ttfciAAt j HiU* w* t W V 'i o-* « wv, v-AACJ-il^CU to remove that power. i ** 1^ 1 fc 4 ^.. jjgi f/T nrfl /V a ^ ^ ee ?° ^» t ^ fre ~ flflm]:: ' 0,n y p-nd-n.ot jn the Tin^rt »A~t^4,U,t{^ kt fmtUr (n-O^A tuw. k *ML$ cA h ly ’ snd t6ls 1 thinfewas Mr.Ballantyne’s main^int, an assurance of the kind suggested could easily be got round by the Company ifttip wanted to do so. For instance to take the case of the^merger, the B.P.C., instead of giving half the shares to the Texas Company, might have made an agreement with them undertaking to let them have the whole produce of the Bahrein field, or something of that kind. This would really have had the seme effect from the point of view of H.M.G., l.e. it would have brought another company very much into the Bahrein picture. If the company had been a Japanese, German or Italian company, H.M.G. might have objected very much to the arrangement, but under the assurances at present proposed they would not have had any right to + 1 — ^-yim It was not very easy to follow Mr.Ballantyne's arguments, particularly the legal one,, but his real point is perfectly clear, viz. that any specific assurances of the &lt;cind suggested, even if the Company felt that they could safely subscribe to them, would not be really effective from H.M.G.'s point of view. H e suggested that what was really required was a general undertaking by the Company to respect the special interests of H.M.G. i-n the Persian Gulf and to refrain from any action which would prejudice them. After ttlAp /fine discussion we agreed that the simplest procedure might be for Mr.Ballantyne to reply to the letter of 14th July saying that the Company were sorry they could not/©® 8 3. not give the specific assurances requested and that we should then write to Mr. Ballantyne saying that regretted the Company were unable to do this, but that the Company should recognise that both on historical and strategic grounds and in view of their special interests in the Persian Gulf area and that H.M.G. hope that in dealing with any matters connected with the control of the Company or of its policy and operations the vould bear in mind these special interests and take care to avoid any action which might in any way prejudice them. The point oi this would be that the company (who would, under this arrangement, acknowledge the receipt of our letter) would have permanently before them a general obligation to respect H.M.G.»s special interests. This y/ould involve consulting H.M.G. in advance if there was any proposal the effect of which might in any way infringe on these rights (e.g. if there were some suggestion of a combination with an Italian firm or the like). If the Company at some future time actually did something which prejudiced H.M.G.»s interests it would be open to H.M.G. to use the weapon which-'thQy- h&amp;sta in the Gulf to make the company’s position uncomfortable and the Company would not be able to complain in the light of the present correspondence. fowl*} In fact, instead of having the company with a legal agreement from which they would be quite capable of disentangling themselves if they wished, H.M.G. would have bound the company with an extra-legal understanding which would enable H.M.G. in the event of any breach to use the extra*legal weapon!which their spe cial/4 special position in the Gulf, and particularly in Bahrein, enables them to wield, (Q*g* pressure through the Sheikh or through the political Agent by King*s Regulation or the like), I told Mr, Ballantyne I would consult with the other people concerned here and talk to him again later. h.r.CLAvJoNThe Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited 11, Birchin Lan e, London, e.c.3.

In further explanation of the acquisition by The Texas Corporation of one-half interest in The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited: This expansion in the structure of the Bahrein company is for the purpose of enabling Standard Oil Company of California, and The Texas Corporation, to bring together the interdependent factors of crude supplies, and finished product outlets. In this manner, the crude oil production available through the Bahrein concession, and the refinery now under construction by the Bahrein company, will become the sources of both raw and finished petroleum supplies for the markets already established by certain sales subsidiaries viz.: The Texas Company (Australasia) Ltd. The Texas Company (China) Ltd. The Texas Company (India) Ltd. The Texas Company (Philippine Islands) Inc. The Texas Company (South Africa) Ltd. formerly owned by The Texas Corporation, but now owned by the California Texas Oil Company, Limited, subsidiaiy of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited. Activities of these sales subsidiaries extend from Arabia and East and South Africa eastward to India, China, Netherlands East Indies, Philippine Islands, and Australasia. Present plans of expansion of sales facilities include a marine fuel oil terminal at Colombo, Ceylon (to be built by Ceylon Petroleum Company *ted) , and ^ similar terminal at Suez (to be constructed by a company- 2 - yet to 'be formed) . A refinery capable of running approximately 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil is nearing completion on Balire inis land, and plans are already -under way to increase the capacity of this refinery to 20,000 barrels per day. It is contemplated that the completed refin ery will be in operation about the middle of 1937. For the period prior to completion of the Bahrein refinery, petroleum supplies for sales requirements in this area will be fur nished by The Texas Corporation and Standard Oil Company of California, from United States sources. The directors of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited are: H.A.Aylen J.A.Moffett, Jr. ) (nominated by R.H•Morrison ) (Standard Oil Company Max Thornburg ) (of California H.M.

Mr. Clauson, ) India Office. Lord Hood. ) The meeting first examined the question of the ownership of the Hawar Islands. It was agreed that on the evidence at present available these Islands appear^to belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein, and that the burden of disproving his claim lay on any other potential claimants. It was agreed that the Sheikh of Bahrein should be informed accordingly. The meeting then considered the situation arising out of the marketing agreement concluded between the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the Texas Company. Whilst it was admitted that this arrangement did not prejudice His Majesty’s Government’s interests, it was recognised that it was desirable, if possible, to prevent control passing to non-British or non-U. S. A. concerns. It v/as therefore agreed that the Bahrein Petroleum Company should be asked to give two assurances; (l) that they would inform His Majesty’s Government well in advance / of any large dealings in shares or any other transactions dz affecting the Company; (2; that the Company would give an undertaking that the Directors v/ould not, without the consent of His Majesty’s Government, permit any dealings in shares, or enter into any arrangement resulting/ ^ Tresulting in a situation in which the control of the Company would he secured hy a concern in which American or British interests did not hold at least 50 per cent, of the share capital. The meeting then considered various questions arising out of the negotiations for the unallotted area at Bahrein, for which the Bahrein Petroleum Company was competing. The Admiralty representative raised the question of pre-emption hy His Majesty 1 s Government in time of emergency. He pointed out that the present mining lease held hy the Bahrein Petroleum Company differed from the other oil agreements in the Gulf, and those to which Petroleum Concessions Limited were being asked to subscribe, in the respect that it contained no pre-emption clause. He said that in the event of the Bahrein Petroleum Company obtaining the lease of the unallotted area the Admiralty would like to see a percentage pre-emption clause included which would cover the whole of Bahrein. This gave rise to some discussion. Mr. Starling considered that it would be unfair to bring up the old lease and to try to obtain concessions over the whole areaj whilst it was pointed out that to include a pre-emption clause in an agreement covering the unallotted area would merely tend to draw attention to the absence of the pre-emption clause in the present mining lease. the point was not pursued, and it was agreed that the Bahrein Petroleum Company should merely be informed that in the event of their obtaining the lease for the unallotted area from the Sheikh, they would be required to subscribe to such coneyssions as His Majesty’s Government would lay down. Mr./•n Mr» btarling then suggested that His Majesty’s Government should exert a _sub rosa influence to induce the Sheikh to give the concession for the unallotted area to , t, * ■ ( tk v.c ^ uhJ Petroleum Concessions Limited.

We have therefore no hold over the Company, and mmi it is doubtful whether any form of words could be devised which would be at all effective^ iL. The matter will he discussed with the Petroleum Department, Foreign Office and Admiralty on Thursday this week, and it is proposed to base the discussion on the Legal Adviser's note and Mr.Starling's letter, accepting any conclusion which Mr.Starling considers satisfactory. It seems likely that it may be agreed to ask the Company (a) to let us know in advance of any further proposals for transfer of capital and control, (b) to give an assurance (either by letter or to be incorporated in any revision of the lease) that the Company will take any means in its power to ensure that (without His Majesty's Government’s consent) control of the Company should not be secured by a concern in which American and/or British interests did not hold at least 5092 of the share capital. Even if they did not accept (b), the Company would no doubt grant (a) And it is as much in their interests ' as/as His Majesty’s Government’s to keep the Company in American hands. As regards the last three sentences of Mr.Starling’s letter, it seems quite out of the question at this stage to hack Petroleum Concessions Limited against the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The discussions of the Unallotted Area in 1933 were all based on the assumption that His Majesty’s Government must he neutral in the matter (see the note at Flag B). The Bahrein Petroleum Company have been told that they can put in for the Unallotted Area in fact the Sheikh has asked them to compete for it, with our approval. If we now advise him to give the concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited, the matter can hardly remain hid, and His Majesty’s Government’s position would be indefensible internationally. The Sheikh in any case would probably not take our advice unless we gave him definite orders, and it is impossible/that the matter is one ot vital importanceto Imperial interests. It is accordingly proposed to resist firmly any suggestion from the Petroleum Department that His Majesty’s Government should abandon their position of neutrality.

I note what the Company have decided to do with regard to the unallotted area. As regards marketing arrangements, the Texas Company is a substantial and reputable concern, and purely American controlled, with marketing organisations in various parts of the East. It is not associated with the big oil groups, but while preserving its independence, it is in fairly close touch with those groups and I gather is regarded as being on reasonably friendly terms. I have made one or two discreet enquiries as to the views of the big British Companies on the marketing of Bahrein oil because, as I think you know, there were some talks between the M. J.

INDIA. — 2 s'' big groups and the standard of California a short time ago which broke down. Broadly, the view is that, short of a direct arrangement with the Standard of California, there are certain advantages from their point of view in a company like the Texas handling the oil since it will flow into those channels where they normally trade. There will thus be a minimum of disturbance of markets which is all to the good from the point of view of British oil interests. As regards the Question whether we can do anything in the way of securing any further safeguards for H.M. Oovernment, I think we are on difficult ground to try to insist on any new conditions now, unless your legal advisers were of opinion that to admit the Texas Company to a half share of the capital brought Art. XIII. into operation. So far as a new concession is concerned, I think our hands are free to consider any reaaonable new conditions, but we should have to be careful not to put forward anything to the Bahrein ^ j? troleum company which we would not equally suggest to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in which there are British, French, American and Dutch interests. we carried the matter as far as we could when the existing British Control clause was inserted, and the only suggestion which occurs to me at the moment is that we might, as Mr. Ballantyne has asked whether we have any views, possibly suggest that the Companyshould give us an undertaking that they will not, without our consent, enter into any arrangement which would result which American and/or British interests did not hold at least 50 per cent, of the share capital. This is on the assumption that the Bahrein Petroleum Company is to he allowed to have the remainder of Bahrein. There is, however, the possibility that H.M# Government may consider it desirable to suggest to the Sheikh that it might be a good thing to give the remainder of Bahrein to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Once the Bahrein Petroleum Company gets the whole area it will probably increase the difficulty of any arrangement being come to between the Standard of California and the other big groups (which really means the Iraq Petroleum Co.) over this territory with the object of securing a measure of British control. I appreciate the difficulty and in view of the issues involved it might be as well if we were to have an inter-departmental discussion on the whole matter. in ^ control of the Company being secured by a concern in Yours sincerely, P.S.

Under the provisions of the B.P.C.’s lease there i is no means of preventing the introduction of new interests by the acquisition of share capital. Nor (subject to what the Petroleum Dept, may have to say, and subject to any further information regarding the proposed scheme) does there appear to be any reason for objecting to the acquisition of half the share capital by the Texas Coy. in return for their services in marketing. As regards the further possibility that at some future date the B.P.C. might by similar means introduce other foreign elements which we would consider undesirable, the question is whether this could be effectively articles of association* If we were to attempt by express provision to prevent undesirable foreign elements controlling the B.P.C. , such provision would presumably, on the above analogy, be to the effect that the ooy. should not at any time be directly or indirectly controlled by nersons other than United States citizens or Bntisn subjects. It is perhaps doubtful whether a provision of this kind, seeking to limit the free transfer of share capital, can ever be really effective. In any case, tne risk of the B.P.C. parting with control to Russian or . Japanese interests seems very remote and hardly worth guarding against by any elaborate piece of machinery. i/36 de/ prevented.

Mr. Ballantyne pointed out that it was not for him as a servant of the Company to suggest that H.M.G. might want to make any requests to the Company or comment on their scheme, but the company were particularly anxious that H.M.G. should be fully informed, and it occurred to him that it would be in the best ultimate interests of the Company that H.M.G. should be quite satisfied that their interests were not going to be adversely affected by the importation of a new it principal which might conceivably atsome later stage lead to undesirable complications, I understand that the Texas Co, are themselves a most respectable organisation and purely American ( Starlin gs will be able, of course, to confirm whether this is the case) but of' wcwao their importation into Bahrein the/company means that they will have a share not only in the marketing but also in the producing side of the business and this might presumably lead to further developments, e,g, if the Texas Co. subsequently got attached to some other perhaps not American company, which might not be desirable fromH.M.G.*s point of view, I It might be worth considering whether we should intimate to the B.P.C, that while H.M.G. quite appreciate that it is necessary for the Company to make arrangements to market its oil (and this is all to the good so far as the Sheikh*s revenues are concerned) H.M.G. view with some disquiet the introduction of new interests into the B.P.C., and they look to the Company to ensure by some appropriate means that H.M.G. are safeguarded from the possibility of further outside bodies acquiring interes t in the B.P.C. They would, for instance, suggest that provision might be made whereby none of the share capital of ! the/Draft Paper 4289 5000 12.35 Department. 59 (fej) the B.P.C* could be alienated without the consent of and that the capital could not be increased without similar consent, // ^ ^ ^^7 f* llA* fr* iAfri***-. . The papers are being referred to our Legal Adviser for his observations and in the meantime I should be glad if you would kindly let me know whether you have any observations to offer on the scheme or on the line that H.M.G, might take in regard to future safeguards. It is, of course, possible that if the B.P.C. get the unallotted area in Bahrein, the main lease will have to be amended to cover the new holding. That may be a opportunity for putting in any safeguards that might be decided upon in the present connection. Mr. Ballantyne is, of course, anxious for an early reply.

Note of a conversation with Mr. Ballantyne on 19th June 1936. Mr. Ballantyne called yesterday afternoon on his return from San Francisco where he has been conferring with the Principals of Standard Oil of California. He had two points to raise; (1) The unallot te d area , He said that the Company had definitely decided to acquire the unallotted area, and instructions have been sent to skinner, the chief local representative, accordingly. He is to enquire from the Bahrein Government what procedure is necessary to deal with the matter in view of the Sheikh’s absence. The Company are hopeful that they may be able to make an offer - * to the Sheikh which may clinch the matter definitely. I said that this, of course, is a matter for the Sheikh and that H.M.G. have, as he knows, been quite neutral in the matter all along. My impression was that the negotiations would probably have to mark time until the Sheikh returned to Bahrein, as it was unlikely that His Excellency would have time or be prepared to do anything while he was in this country, and it would clearly not be possible to do much in Bahrein in the absence of the Sheikh. Mr. Ballantyne said that would quite suit the Company and that in any case Mr. Skinner would be reporting to them shortly. (2) Marketing . Referring to certain press statements which had been c aJL 7 o / made recently (one of which I had mentioned to Mr. Hamilton when/2* 61 when he called here the other day), Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company were in the final stages of negotiation with the Texas Company for the conclusion of a marketing arrangement. The Texas Company have a wide organisation m (l thinx) India,, Africa, Australia and South Arabia, and will be able to dispose of as much oil as Standard oil can produce both in Bahrein and on the mainland of Arabia. The 01 iginal idea was to have a holding company in London, but after carefully considering the question of income tax in England, the United States and Canada, the Company had come to the conclusion that the soundest and most economical method of setting up the marketing organisation was not to create a new company, but to extend the functions of the Bahrein Petroleum Company to cover the marketing as well as the production of oil. The scheme is that half the share capital of the. Company will be acquired by the Texas Company. The Bahrein Petroleum Company will continue to exist precisely as at present constituted and all that would happen would be a redistribution of capital, either by an increase of the capital or by the sale of some of the existing capital. Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company wished to have no secrets from H.M.'G. and, though they were, of course, under no legal obligation to do so, were anxious that H.M.G. should be fully informed of the arrangements that were in contemplation. it might be that H.M.G. might have some comments to make from their own point of view and, of course, if so, the Company would be prepared to give them careful consideration, M.J.CLAUSOH.

WITNESSES as follows: — Article I. THE Sheikh hereby grants to the Com pany on behalf of himself and his successors the exclusive right for a period of fifty-five years from the first of January One thousand nine hundred and thirty-five to prospect and drill for, extract, treat, refine, manufacture, transport and deal with petroleum products, naphtha, natural greases, tar, asphalt, ozokerite, and other bituminous materials within the area or areas described in words in the First Schedule to this lease and delineated on the map attached as the Second Schedule thereto.

Any such compensation shall not exceed a fair and reasonable recom pense to the Sheikh for the dispossession of his right to the surface of such land and having regard to the prices ordinarily current for similar land situated in the locality; failing agreement as to the com pensation payable to the Sheikh the matter shall be referred to and determined by arbitration in the manner provided by Article XXII hereof. tn the lands so ^anted_the Compa ny shall for the pe riodoTThls iease enjoy full p roprietary rightsr3 The Sheikh also recognises that the Company have the right to acquire all and any oth er land s and buildings necessary loriiie said purpose with thTconsentof Jne_p^prle^rs (including the Sheikh in his capacity as private landowner) on such conditions as may be arranged between the Company and the said proprietors without their being allowed to make demands of a nature to surcharge the prices ordinarily current for lands and buildings situated in their respective localities. At the termination of this lease the ground and all immovable property left by the Company shall be handed back to the Sheikh; all borings (including casing therein) which the Company have not abandoned shall be handed over in reason ably good order and repair; and all other property of the Company may be removed by the Company free of all taxes and duties, provided however that for a period of thirty days following the termination of this lease the Sheikh shall have the right to purchase such property at a price equal to the replacement value at that date, less depreciation, which price in the absence of agreement shall be settled by arbitration in the manner set forth in this lease. It is however understood that within the leased area the Company shall be entitled to acquire only such land as is necessary for their pipe-lines, refineries, offices and other works and that save, in so far as it is necessary in order to enable their pipe lines and railways to pass freely to their destination, they sh all no t a cquire as pro - vide d by paragrap h' 3 ofTTils Article' any ' TanH^iitside i 1 1 e lea secTarea which~mlgf it otherwise be leasecf fof, t he pro d u ction-of oil t o a third party, unless they can satisfy UTe^Sheikh that noo! fieri and suitable for their purpose is available.

ALL lands granted by this lease to the Company or that may be acquired by the Company in the manner provided for in Article II of this lease as also all products exported shall be free of all imposts and taxes during the tenure hereof.4 All material and apparatus of every kind necessary for the exploration, y rk- ing and development of the deposit and for the construction and development of the pipe-lines including also all the works specified in the first paiagraph of Article I hereof and office requirements but not including the personal requirements of employees shall enter the said territory free of all taxes and custom house duties. This privilege shall continue in force for a term of ten years from the date hereof. Article IV. THE Sheikh undertakes to give all the protection in his power to the Company and to their staff and laborers in any part of his territory from thefts, highway robbery, assault, &amp;c. Similarly the Sheikh undertakes to protect all the property of the Company and of their employees &lt; which may be exposed to wilful damage or to possible loss by theft. If the Company’s work is delayed by such events as are mentioned in this Article or by any cause beyond the Com pany’s control arising in Bahrein then the period shall be added to the period for which this lease is granted and the annual minimum royalty of Rs. 75,000 provided for by Article VIII shall not be payable in respect of such delay. Article V. FOR the above purposes it is agreed that the Company in communication with the Sheikh shall appoint permanent trust worthy guards under a reliable man of good family whose pay and that of the guards shall be provided by the Company and who shall remain there summer and winter. If in spite of the efforts of the said guards thefts should occur, the Sheikh undertakes to recover the property stolen and to compensate the Company for any damage sustained in his territory. In the event of non-recovery of the stolen property, the value thereof shall be65 5 deducted by the Company from any sums due to the Sheikh by the Company. The number of guards at any place where the Company may operate shall be fixed by the Company. It shall be the duty of the above-men tioned head of the guard to keep order in the areas in his charge to such extent as the Company may order him, he shall have no right to interfere in any disputes among the Company’s servants unless asked by the Company to do so. The Company hereby agree that so long as the provisions of Bahrein Orders in Council 1913 and 1922, or any Order in consolidation thereof or in substitution therefor or supplementary thereto, remain in force, and jurisdiction over certain foreigners in the State of Bahrein is exer cised by His Britannic Majesty, the provisions in the second paragraph of this Article V shall not apply in respect to commissions of any acts of theft or damage by any person (1) if, on such person being arrested, it is found that he is a foreigner over whom jurisdiction exercised by His Britannic Majesty under the said Orders in Council has been extended, or (2) if, in the event of no arrests being made, it is proved to the satisfaction of the Company, or if necessary, the Political Agent, that the offender is such a foreigner as above mentioned, and that he has left the territory governed by the Sheikh and has not to the knowledge of the Sheikh or his officials returned thereto, and that no arrest could therefore be made. Article VI. IN case of misconduct the said guards are subject to dismissal or fine by the Company. In the event of any heavier punishment being needed, the offender shall be handed over to the representative of the Sheikh, and the Sheikh undertakes that punishment shall be inflicted and to use his utmost endeavours to uphold the authority of the Company’s employees, thereby avoiding unnecessary troubles to both parties to this lease.6 Article VII. THE Company agree to pay to the Sheikh the following royalties, namely (a) Rs. 3.S.0 per ton of net crude oil got and saved (i.e. after deducting water and foreign substances and oil required for the customary operations of the Company’s installations in the Sheikh’s territories). (b) Rs. 3.8.0 per ton of casing-head petroleum spirit extracted by the Company from natural gas where the average recovery from the gas treated from the various wells over the relative period of accounting is under two imperial gallons per One thousand cubic feet of natural gas at a pressure of one atmosphere and at a temper ature of sixty degrees Fahrenheit and Rs. 7.0.0. per ton of the casing-head petroleum spirit so recovered where such average recovery is two imperial gallons or more. No royalty shall be payable on the casing-head petroleum spirit required for the customary operations of the Company’s installations in the Sheikh’s territories. It is under stood that the Company shall be under no obligation to extract casing-head petroleum spirit from natural gas. The foregoing royalties reserved by Clauses (a) and (b) are subject to revision at the end of fifteen years’ payment and in default of agreement either party shall have the right to demand that the question at issue shall be submitted to arbitration in the manner provided in this lease. (c) A sum equal to one-sixth of the field price received for the sale of any natural gas recovered by the Company, it being understood that the Company shall be under no obligation to produce, save, sell, or otherwise dispose of any natural gas nor shall the Com pany be required to pay anyI 7 royalty on natural gas used in the Company’s installations in the Sheikh’s territories. The above royalties are payable on the basis of calendar half-yearly periods (i.e. from January first to June thirtieth and from July first to December thirty-first of each year) and in respect of such net crude oil and casing-head petroleum spirit as may be run from field storage (subject to the above-mentioned deductions) during each half-yearly period and in respect of such natural gas as may be sold during each half-yearly period. Settlement of royalty accounts shall be made between the parties within three months after the end of each half-yearly period. FOR the purposes of such royalty pay ments the Company shall measure by a method customarily used in good oilfield practice all crude oil won and saved and casing-head petroleum spirit extracted and the Sheikh by his representative duly authorised by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf shall have the right to examine such measuring and to examine and test whatever appliances may be used for such measuring. If upon such exam ination or testing any such appliance shall be found to be out of order the Sheikh may require that the same be put in order by and at the expense of the Company and if such requisition be not complied with in a reasonable time the Sheikh may cause the said appliance to be put in order and may recover the expense of so doing from the Company and if upon any such examination as aforesaid any error shall be discovered in any such appliance such error shall if the Sheikh so decide after hearing the Company’s explanation be considered to have existed for three calendar months previous to the discovery thereof or from the last occasion of exam ining the same in case such occasion shall be within such period of three calendar months and the royalty shall be adjusted accordingly. If the Company- desire to alter any measuring appliance it shall give reasonable notice to the Sheikh or his representative to enable a repre sentative of the Sheikh to be present during such alteration.THE Company shall keep full and correct accounts of all crude oil casing-head petroleum spirit measured as aforesaid and of the natural gas sold (including the field price received for it) and the said representative of the Sheikh shall have access at all reasonable times to the books of the Company containing such accounts and shall be at liberty to make extracts therefrom and the Company shall at their own expense within three calendar months after the end of each calendar half-year deliver to the Sheikh an abstract of such accounts for such half- year and a statement of the amount of royalty due to the Sheikh for such half- year. ~ Such accounts shall be treated as confidential to the Sheikh with the excep tion of such figures therein as he may be required by law to publish. Article VIII. SUBJECT to the “ delay” exception mentioned in Article IV of this lease the Company hereby undertake that the amount received by the Sheikh in respect of royalties shall not be less than at the rate of Rs. 75,000 in every calendar year in which this lease continues in operation. Article IX. THE Company shall carry on work within the leased area in accordance with good oilfield practice and with all proper zeal and diligence and shall maintain at least two strings in continuous operation (allowing a reasonable time between the completion of one well and the commence ment of the new) until a sufficient number of wells have been drilled within the productive area covered by this lease to meet the requirements of good oilfield practice. Provided, however, that such obligation to maintain at least two strings in continuous operation shall be suspended during such time as the wells then drilled are capable of a total daily average pro duction of at least one thousand tons of oil.Article X. IN the event of the Company failing within six months of the end of any calendar half-year to pay to the Sheikh the royalties due in respect of that calendar half-year or failing, save for causes beyond their control, to carry out their obligations under this lease, the Sheikh shall have the power to terminate this lease in which case the provisions of the last paragraph but one of Article II shall apply. Article XI. THE Company shall have the right to terminate this lease upon giving not less than three months’ written notice to the Sheikh of the intention of the Company so to do, and accordingly upon the expiration of such notice this lease shall absolutely determine upon the date fixed for deter mination in such notice, save as regards matters to be done at or after such determination. Article XII. THE Company shall take all practical measures to prevent an injurious access of water to any oil bearing formations which may be encountered either while opera tions are in progress or upon the abandon ment of any well and to prevent any uncontrolled flow of oil.

DAVIES Its Attorneys-in-Fact Before me G. LOCH British Political Agent in Bahrein.The question of a lease for the unallotted, portion of Bahrein came up in 1933, when general negotiations were in progress with the Bahrein Petroleum Company. Major Holmes was at that time the Chief Local Representative of the B.P.C. ^Ifihia Office letter of the 1st August 1933, (P.Z.4649/33), Mr. Ballantyne was informed that the Sheikh of Bahrein was prepared, subject to safeguards, to consider an oxfer from the Bahrein Petroleum Company in respect of the area in the Bahrein Islands 'which will remain unallotted after the Company have selected their area under the provisions of Article 5 of the Agreement of 2nd December 1925'. At that time the Company were asking for an extension of their prospecting licence and Major Holmes connected the two questions together. This, however, was apparently inconsistent with the wishes of the Company and there was a good deal of muddle which it took some correspondence and meetings to clear up. m a record of an interdepartmental meeting at the India Office on the 10th August (P..6.5293/33) it was stated that while Major Holmes had entangled the two questions of the extension of the ares to be covered by the Company's operations and of the extension of the Company's prospecting licence, it appeared now that their intention was again to separate the two questions and deal with them independently. Mr * Ballantyne, in an interview at the India was Office on the 2qrd August (P*Z.5253/33]/asked whether the Company wished to disinterest themselves in the remaining area of Bahrein, since this appeared to be the case from communications received from the Gulf. Mr. Ballantyne replied/6/ - 2 - replied that this was not the case, but that the Company’s headquarters in San Francisco had intimated that no offer should now be made in respect of the remaining area until further information was available as to prospects. We were not, however, to think that the Company no longer wished to consider the remaining area. In a letter dated 11th August to the Political Agent, Bahrein, Major Holmes said that 'this Company is not prepared - at the moment - to make a fresh proposal for acquiring oil rights over the additional area'. Meanwhile, the Resident telegraphed on the 11th August (P.Z.4932/33) that he had received a letter from the General Manager, A*P»0#C«, Abadan, asking him to inform the Sheikh that they wished to interest themselves in the remaining area. 5* The following is an extract from a letter from the India Office to Mr. Ballantyne dated 26th September (P.Z.6192/33). 'I might point out that the area of Bahrein being in the neighbourhood more or less of 200,000 acres and the area which the Company are required to take up under their mining lease being an aggregate of not more than 100,000 acres, it is quite clear that when the mining lease has been taken out there will remain a balance of approximately the same extent, in respect of which the Sheikh has already indicated that he would be open to offers either from the Company or from the A.P.O.C, who, as I explained to you, have indicated their desire to put forward a proposition in respect of it'.3 - A ««?&gt;■ fiM U-?yP£ ^v-9^ / fol yv&amp;^pf fa£tt--T*d k\^ t kJm# * &amp;~+ ('Uk***#, 6 * r ^ Cie following is an extract from a telegram to the Political Resident dated 14th November 1933, (P.Z.7392/ 33). * Successful operation by Bahrein Petroleum Company under mining lease would afford best guarantee of subsequent application in respect of remainder of Islands, either from A.P.O.C. or from Bahrein Petroleum Company, although this might not, of course,happen for some years.' 7• It will be seen from the above brief references that it was in 1933 the policy to keep the field open between the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the A.P.O.C. in respect of the unallotted area. It might therefore be unfair at this stage to give Petroleum Concessions Limited a free hand and not to make some communication to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. 8 . It may also be worth referring to Bushire telegram of 4th August 1933 (P.Z.4750/33), in which the Resident said 'I think that it would be advisable for the A.P.O.C. also to conduct negotiations, written and oral, entirely through the Political Agent, as it will be contrary to their interests and ours if the Bahrein Petroleum Company wereplaced in a position to complain that we were favouring the A.P.O.C. by allowing their emissary direct access to Sheikh when the *&gt;5 tufat+A &amp; k j i Chief Local Representative was debarred from it.'V CONFIDENTIAL.

D. Tompkins Standard Oil Company of Califor nia, -which for some time has been unsuccessfully seeking a share of for eign oil markets for Its Bahrein Island (Persian Gulf) properties, is about to achieve its objective through an im portant deal with the Texas Company, leading independent, according to well posted sources. Negotiations are In progress, it is said, whereby California Standard, and Texas will enter into an agreement providing for utilization of the Bah rein reserves, calculated by engineers to be In excess of 600,000,000 barrels even at their current early stage of development. Texas Company engi neers, it is believed, will complete a survey of the properties soon. While details of the proposed agree ment are not available, it is believed that Texas Company would be jointly interested in California Standard’s new Bahrein refinery and would sup ply the extensive selling outlets re quired. Expansion Heralded The reported transaction places em phasis on the aggressive manner in. which both companies have embarked on international expansion policies. The Texas Company has been prom inently mentioned in the news re cently as joint buyer, with Socony- Vacuum Oil Company, of an approx imately 80 per cent interest in the famous Barco oil concession in Co lombia from Gulf Oil (Mellon) inter ests. In announcing the consummation of this transaction, T. Reiber, chair man, and W. S. S. Rodgers, president of Texas Company, and officials of Socony-Vacuum, indicated that devel opment work in the Barco tract would be carried out in a vigorous manner; facilities would be provided for refin ing and marketing the oil, and pipe lines and other transportation means established. Texas Company and So cony-Vacuum had previously been partners in an oil refinery in Argen tina and also are interested in Peru vian oii lands, according to reports. Texas also has other potential oil pro ducing lands in Colombia adjacent to the Barco concession. / New Rivalry Seen Of particular interest In connection with the reported California Stand- ardfTexas agreement is the undenied report that the former sought some time ago to effect an agreement with Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and Royal Dutch-Shell group whereby Jersey and Shell would take care of | the Bahrein output and enable Cali fornia Standard to realize on Its in vestment. Whether or not this would indicate the formulation of a new competitive set-up of formidable pro portions in foreign oil markets is R , matter of conjecture. It would seem, however, that the two companies will claim a good slice of the foreign business, which has been increasing rapidly in recent years. At the same time, they im prove their position by obtaining oil supplies less subject to proration reg ulations, taxes and other factors that apply to output of petroleum and its derivatives in the United States. The drive by California Standard to 1 obtain wider markets has been the j subject of considerable analysis by industrial writers in the last year or more. 'World Petroleum” recently called attention to the company’s in ternational expansion program, and various authorities have predicted since collapse of the merger negotia tions with Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, that the California unit would have to be contended with be fore long in bidding for foreign busi ness. Other Rights Obtained Supplementary to its Bahrein Island concession, first obtained j about five years ago, California I Standard obtained drilling rights in Eastern Saudi Arabia and is now en gaged in exploration work there. Pre viously, it explored possibilities of oil in Alaska, the Philippines, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and other areas with but indifferent success. In March the company entered into the Texas Gulf Coast area by obtain ing a lease to 6,000 acres of Texas public school lands. The deal, it was said, is a preliminary to more im portant operations in Texas and pos sibly Louisiana by the same concern. Sale of oil from the Bahrein prop erties of California Standard has been strictly limited up to the present time. The company has shipped sev eral cargoes from Bahrein to Japan, where the government had been at odds with Standard-Vacuum and Shell interests over Japanese oil laws adopted last year. Whether any of the Bahrein oil has been sent to California Standard’s refining inter ests in France is not definitely known. For some time it has. however, been shipping oil from its Kettleman Hills, California, production to certain French refineries. that fh« nCh 0il circ!es ts stated tnat the company has either mir_ chased outright or otherwise acquired fine*? de la n Cial interest in the +(? ri Berre, near Marseilles in s °' th of France. In addition, it Jiff, reported at various times that California Standard has been negotiatmg for Russian Oil Products, u;a., the Soviet marketing erganiza- tion in Great Britain. Enters Mexico ^ The company has been decidedly non-committal with respect to these reports, while admitting that the oil situation abroad is being closely watched by company representatives and engineers. Officially, however expansion of California Standard op erations in Mexico, where the New fvff ey ® tan 2 ard * through its subsidi- Sfirme? l0ng estsbU ' hM ’ “ , 1 ^ 3 . 6, accordin g to California ® „ J 2 dard s annual statement, $33,- 708,640 was expended on construction and the acquisition of properties, of which $23,073,526 represented produc tion. The report disclosed a net in crease of $10,924,122 in fixed assets. The actual extent to which Texas Company has expanded its facilities abroad, as well as its future inten tions in this respect, are largely mat ters of conjecture. Under former managements, only passing attention was given to the foreign picture be cause of the plentiful supplies of oil in this country and necessity for fully integrating the domestic or ganization. The oil industry gen erally regards development of many foreign oil fields as something which will occur in the future. Increased foreign demand in recent years coupled with rising costs of produc tion in the United States because of taxes and other restrictions on the industry have accelerated develop ment abroad. The Texas Company supplies oil for the Spanish oil monopoly, ships to the Orient and to various other parts of the world, and maintains a ; growing tanker fleet for the purpose. ! The increase in its foreign operations over the last few years lias been sub stantial.lf4D£.A 0 , £P -■ r~ Confidential. u V tf/ *&lt;-«-£ The Resid ency, y ^JL| W Bushir e, 4th January 1936.

The Bahrain Petroleum Company presumably will dislike the idea of another Oil Company v/orking cheek by jowl with them in such a small area as Bahrain. As a price for calling off this nuisance Petroleum Concessions Ltd. might ask for (l) a more accommodating attitude on the part of the Bahrain Petroleum Company towards combined marketing arrangements or (2) some control in the Bahrain Petroleum Company itself by sale of shares, or both. 3.

A meeting undoubtedly took place in New York between representatives of the three groups mentioned, to consider the possibility of taking up the production of the California Standard Oil Company at Bahrein, and probably also Hasa. The Company, however, attached such high value to the prospects of their concessions and to the quality of the oil produced there, that it was impossible to come to terms. The three groups are content to hold their hand for the moment, as th^ believe that the California Company will have difficulty over their marketing and will find that they have over-rated the quality of their prospective products/products, especially Kerosene.

It will be remembered that the Bahrein Petroleum Company are now anxious to take out a Mining Lease as from 1st January 1935 and that agreement has for practical purposes been reached with them on the terms of a revised Mining Lease wnicn will give the Sheikh certain financial, advantages which he would not have enjoyed unaer the original lease and which will in other ways safeguara his interests more adequately than that lease would have done. The new lease, like the existing lease, provides that ’•rights granted by this lease shall not be conveyed to a third party without the consent of the oheikh, acting under the auvice of the Resident in the Persian Gulf* Such consent shall not oe unreasonably withheld*. The new lease also ' I2. embodies certain speciai safeguards; e.g. that the Company shall be and remain a British company; that its office in Great Britain shall be in charge of a British subject, who shall be the recognised channel of communication; that there shall be a British Director; that the Chief Local Representative of the Company in Bahrein shall be approved by H.M.G.; and that as many of the employeedof the Company as is 1 consistent with the efficient carrying on of the unaertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the sheikh of Bahrein. 2* The Bahrein Petroleum Company are, it is understood, experiencing difficulties in finding a market for their products. Tiie Iraq Petroleum Company (including the A.P.O.c# group) on the other hand, have for some time past realised that it was a bad mistake to allow the Bahrein concession to pass into the hanus of the Standard oil of California. The latest reports go to show that oil borne roui'io In suDstential Quantities and tlie I.P• 0# are not merely anxious to reacli some working arrangement with the stanaard Gil in respect of operation in the Gulf area, but if possible to reach a friendly agreement In regard to the threat which very substantial production of Bahrein oil might constitute to their markets in the Par Past and elsewhere. 3. Please now see the record of a discussion with Mr - Praser of A.P.O.C. (representing in this connection the I.P.C.) on 26th October, which is self-explanatory, it was thought desirable to convey the information given bv j't' Im. eraser without delay to the Political Resident in view o£ his telegram reporting that representatives of toe l.P.c. arrived m Bahrein and asking whether we had any information us bo their object, &amp;c *-^ cU,f^ 4 ^Lx^( VaA (fc lA^r- J O) fa 4 /99 Minute Paper.

It is cidarly too early yet to juoge whether there is an^^ probability of the I.p.c. bringing their negotiations with tne stanoaru Oil to a successful outcome ana there is little point at this stage in examining in detail the various alternatives referred to in Lr. Fraser's conversation here on 26th October. Politicaily_ there would be great advantage in securing either complete elimination of the Standard Oil interests from Bahrein Rasa and Qatar, or, as a pis aller tne conclusion of some understanding as a result or wnicn tne I.FTOT'. would have a voice in oil development in tnis area, more particularly if it could be arranged (as might be possible) that tne actual exploitation or handling of oil questions in the Gulf region should be entrusted to the British groups (Shell and A.P.O.C.) in th e r • P • C • farG+M* kmrur** UjuU. UA-ixj^ 5 , prom the point of view oi tne sheiihn, tne essential thing is that he should not. oe victimised by any agreement oetween tne I.r• and the standard Gil as a result of which production in Bahrein would be slowed a own or even closed down altogether anu the State in consequence have notning more ^o look ^or tnan tne minimum royalty of Rs.75,000 to which tne Bahrein Petroleuni Company have now agreed.

It is unnecessary to go &lt;1*^ into this possibility at the present s tage, since it may well be that if the negotiations succeed, the arrangement between the Standard ana the X.P.C. will be on the basis of an l agreement about marketing in return for some understanaing as regards volume of proauction from —^ tv+ 0* Hrd, Uaa* fo &lt;fc tokiU OL (Pe. &amp; tivJeL fcou ) Bahrein, «rfatoi/woula n&amp;b need the Sheikh's approval ^ or any reference to him. But prima facie it would seem reasonable to consider whether we cannot endeavour to secure from any assignee company, in the event of an assignment, a further increase in minimum royalty failing a guarantee (which they would certainly refuse to give) of a specified minimum A production. We should be on good ground in putting forward such a claim to this extents that the sheikh uas already a standard to which to work in the figure of a production ox 5,000 barrels per day mentioned to him by the Bahrein Petroleum Company's representatives last year.

P.Z.6687/34. Inaia Office. yfj/: -do BAHREIN OIL. Memorandum of discussion at the India Office on 26th Octoher, 1934,, between Mr.Fraser of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Mr.Malt on and Mr .Laithvjaite. Mr. Fraser called at the India Office on the 26th October to mahe a communination regarding the future of the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s concession in Bahrein. He said that for some months past very tentative and confidential discussions had been proceeding between the I.P.C. and the Standard Oil of California in regard to this concession. It appeared that the discussions were suggested consequent on the difficulty which tte Bahrein Petroleum Company was experiencing in finding a market for its oil and the anxiety, on the other hand, of the I.P.C. to eliminate Amorl.e^ interests from an area in which they regarded them as haring no right to operate and to meet the threat which a very large production by those interests would constitute in the market. 2. In the course of the last few days the Chairman of the Standard Oil had at last intimated that he was prepared to come to London (arriving at the beginning of November) in order to examine the possibilities of some arrangement with n iio Tonri pn’ven an esfimafe of 'the the I.P.C. more closely. He had given ctu -i — T n-f ■R^hroin which the I.P.C. potential productive capacity ox Banrem . . 4 r , + if . in view, however, of the relevance regarded as optimistic. ? of this point to the nature of any arrangement to be concluded they had thought it desirable to accept an offer of the Standard Oil to allow representatives of the I.P.C. to visit Bahrein// 0 ) 192 _ 2 Bahrein and verify the position. Three representatives of the principal negotiating groups had accordingly been despatched for this purpose by aeroplane. A few days in Bahrein would suffice for the purpose of their investigations. They would return by air ? so that the result of their investigations could be available before the arrival of the Chairman of the Standard Oil. Mr. Fraser mentioned at this point that the French interests in the I.P.C. which were not directly associated i with the present negotiations^ Y^iere very suspicious of the negotiations which were proceeding, and that on learning that a visit of investigation to Bahrein was contemplated, a representative of the French group serving in Iraq had on his own responsibility at once proceeded to Bahrein by air independently. 3. Mr, Fraser emphasised that matters were still at a very early stage and that it was impossible to forecast until the discussions had proceeded further what, if any, arrangement could be reached between the Standard Oil and the I.P.C. He did, however, indicate that no transaction was likely to be entirely satisfactory to the I.P.C. which did not result m the elimination of the Standard Oil from Hasa as well as from Bahrein - in a word, in the exclusion of independent operation by the Standard Oil from the Gulf Sheikhdoms and Ibn Saud’s territory; and that the I.P.C. were anxious to secure as a minimum a 50 per cent, interest in the operations of the Standard Oil and its subsidiary companies in this area. Various possibilities .vere a deal about markets, the effect of -which yjould be to give the Bahrein Petroleum Company some share in markets at present closed to them m return for some understanding as to volume of production; the buying out of the Bahrein Petroleum Company altogether; joint operation/3 operation; or an arrangement under which the position in Bahrein remained unchanged, hut the l.P.c. in return for m Q i concessions to the Bahrein Petroleum Company oocuied counter concessions from the Standard oil in respect 01 the. Has a area. 4. X’he embarrassing nature of the situation which had Been created by the failure of the l.P.c. to give earlier information to the India Office as to their negotiations and hy the despatch without warning of representatives to Bahrein was pointed out to Mr.Fraser. The effect of this visit on trie Sheikh might well be very unfortunate and might react pi c judicially on his att-itud© towards any arrangement to which the Company might at a later stage wish to secure his approval. Mr.Fraser expressed extreme regret that any misunderstanding should have arisen. He was, he said, most anxious lor patriotic reasons to re-establish British influence in cnis area, and he had hoped that this would be one result of the present discussions. He undertook to give the fullest possible information to the India Office as to the course of the negotiations between the I.P.C. and the Standard Oil, on the understanding that it would be regarded as confidential. 5. After further discussion it was agreed that the Political Resident should at once be given confidentially full information as to the position in reply to his telegram of 26th October, Ho.907; but that, in the event of the Sheikh asking for an explanation of the visit of the representatives, it would be better, particularly having regard to the very early stage which the negotiations had reached, and to the difficulty of forecasting their outcome, that he should be informed that we understood that certain groups of the I.P.C. interested in marketing in the Far East were contemplating tentative discussions with the Standard Oil which might affect/4 atleot the disposal of the output of oil at Bahrein, and that they had t&gt; een anxious, with a view to these discussions, to lorm their own impressions as to potential production in the area covered ty the Bahrein Petroleum Company's concession*.
