Strong sun and sea air will bleach the colour to some extent after a time, but the preservative properties of the Solignum still remain in the wood, and the appearance of the wood can he easily freshened up by a further coat of Solignum from time to time. We recommend at least two coats on outdoor work and if the timber is a hard, non-absorbent kind, three coats are recommended. It is advisable, if possible, to allow an interval of a week or two between each coat, as this gives better penetration of the wood and more lasting results. We await with interest your further communica tions, and hope you may decide to place an order. In passing, we should also like to mention that Solignum is a very attractive stain for woodwork, and is there:fore ver y popular for indoor work.

To The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to say that for reasons which I have given in a separate despatch,a new safe is urgently required for this Agency* I had hoped to meet the amount from this year f s budget by reappropriation from the Launch Grant,this has,however,been found to be impossible and owing to the drastic reductions recommended in the Launch Grant in the next and succeeding years,it will not be possible to without funds being specially provided for this purpose. 2. I have had catalogues of safes sent me by Lessrs Baker &amp; Co Limited and it appears that the most suitable one for our needs is a Chubbs’ No:2 Commerce safe v/hich will cost £.23 with the fittings desired. Miner’s,however,advertise a special light safe which might suit our purpose at a cost of £.15,but of course, they have not the reputation of a Chubb’s safe. I estimate the shipping charges and expenses of either safe would amount to some £.5 and I request, there fore, that a sum sufficient to meet this charge of £.28/l0/-,say Rs.400/-,should be provided in my next year’s budget under the head ’Office Allowances ’. I have the honour to be Sir, Your f'ost Obedient Servant Political Agent., Bahrain .oI Political Agency, Bahrain,the 2Gth December 1931.

If anything herein contained be inconsistent with the said Act, it shall, to the extent and on the occasion of such inconsistency and no further, be null and void. The rights and immunities as set forth in Article XV. of the Rules scheduled to and as applied by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924, shall also extend and apply to loss or detention of or damage to goods in the actual custody of the Carrier or his servants, prior to loading on and sub sequent to the discharge from the vessel on which the goods are carried by sea, as fully as if the same were set forth seriatim herein, provided always that neither the Carrier nor the vessel shall under any circumstances be liable for loss or detention of or damage to goods arising from any cause whatsoever when the goods are not in the actual custody of the Carrier or his servants. The carrier shall, notwithstanding anything in this Bill of Lading, have the benefit of all exemptions from and limitations of liability contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, England, and any existing modifications thereof. 2.

The vessel has liberty for the purposes of loading and /or discharging passengers and /or cargo of all kinds dangerous or otherwise, for drydocking with or without the cargo on board, for bunkering or storing, repairing, adjusting compasses or otherwise for any purpose whatsoever of the I/ine or of the vessel, her crew, passengers or lading, to proceed to and stay at any ports or places in the United Kingdom and/or the Continent between Hamburg and Bordeaux both inclusive in any order backwards or forwards and to return to any such port or ports to delay the sailing from any port to proceed by any route and to change the proposed route before the commencement of or at any time or stage of the voyage or to put into and remain at any port for the above purposes and for the same purposes to proceed to any ports or places in the Persian Gulf and its riversand inlets iuany order backwards or forwardsand even though beyond the port of discharge and all or any of such routes or ports or places whether of loading, call or discharging even though not strictly within the customary or advertised route are agreed to be within the intended voyage The vessel may sail with or without pilots, be towed, or tow, and assist vessels in all situations. 3. The goods may be stowed in poop, forecastle, deck house, sheliei deck, or any other covered- in space commonly used in the trade for the carriage of goods, and such goods shall be deemed for all purposes to be stowed under deck. Cargo on deck and livestock are received, kept, loaded, carried and discharged at Shipper’s risk and the Carrier shall not be liable for loss thereof or damage thereto. The Carrier shall have all the same liberties rights and immunities as are available to him for cargo under deck.
