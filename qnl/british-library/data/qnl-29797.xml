I fully appreciate the political situation concerned,but feel that in the event of the Sultan's attitude being unfavourable,a payment of the difference- in rates,in Indian rupees would amply satisfy him. In any case we cannot return to him the actual notes we bought, as these are not separated from the remainder of the Pakistani notes in our treasury.If he requires Pakistani notes however we can quite easily purchase enough on the bazaar to cover his sale to us.No.4/8/14/49. The Political Agency, L Muscat. September 27, 1949• I^y dear Ross Ryder, With reference to our conversation the other day about the Sultan's Pakistani currency account, I mentioned the matter to the Political Resident while he was here, and his opinion was that the Sultan might view the loss in such a serious light that political considerations might be involved. Under the circurastances I am directed, therefore, to request you to suspend repatriation of the Pakistani notes in question until the Sultan's attitude becomes known. You would probably prefer to find this out yourself, but I could approach Woods-Ballard if you wish. Should our fears be realised, the Residency may take the matter up with your Head Office through the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely.

The above account was opened with us in August 1939 by the Director of Revenues of Muscat State and is now being operated by the Sultan Said Bin Taimur. As we have no authenticated signa ture of His Highness, we shall be grateful /- if you will return to us the enclosed signature dulv verified by you. We regret troubling you in this matter and trust this will not unduly inconvenience you and thank you for your kindi co-operation. Enel. gft:KP.COPY Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 17th June, 1949, Lear Hay, Woods-Ballard told me at Muscat that the Sultan would be glad of advice whether some 20 lakhs of rupees which he has invest in Government of India 1954 war bonds should be regarded as a safe investment which could be left until the bonds are due for payment, I passed on the enquiry to the Treasury and enclose a copy of their reply. You may care to tell Woods-Ballard at the next convenient opportunity that cur financial experts have no reason to think that the bonds are unsafe. Yours ever, B.A.B. BURROWS. Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., Political Resident, Bahrain. Confidential E6672/1115/91Treasury ref:lF89/184/01 Treasury Chambers, Great George Street, LCNDCN, S.W.l. Dear Mr. Burrows, I am sorry not to have been very quick in replying to your letter of 26th May about the Sultan of Muscat’s rupee investments. This is a rather embarassing enquiry, since it would, I think be quite improper for H.M.G. to warn the Sultan off Indian investments whatever they were like. Fortunately, though it is true that India may have some trying financial times ahead, we feel we can conscientously advise him that we have no reason to think that his Bonds are not safe. We could perhaps add that rupee securities are, in our view, a very appropriate form of investment for the reserves of a country w r hich uses rupee currency. If the Sultan wanted to sell out and transfer the proceeds out of India he would have to get the consent of the Indian authorities. If he wanted to get into sterling we should be prepared, at the request of the Indians, to make a release for the purpose from India’s blocked sterling balances. The position is, in fact, that described in my letters of 8th and 23rd November 1948 to Mr. Stewart about the similar case of Bahrein. We are not particularly anxious that people who hole rupees should switch into sterling at the expense of releases from Indian blocked sterling and I agree with you that there is no need to give the Sheikh any advice on tlie subject unless he asks for it. Yours sincerely, (Sgd•) MABY LCUGHNANE B.a.B.
