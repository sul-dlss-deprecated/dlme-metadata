Political Agent, BahrainTranslation of a letter dated 10th Habi el awal 1357 (10th iviay 193d) trom Sheikh Abdullah bin Qasim al ihani, C.I.E.j Huler of Qatar, to Mr* H. Weightman, I.C.S., Political Agent, - Bahrain. A.C • I have the honour to refer to the firm friendship, good end strong relations and the treaties which exist between me and H.B.M l s Government upon which I rely, after a 0 d, in all my affairs. In view of this I submitted my protests and complaints to the -tonHole the Political Resident in the Persian tilf and to t the Political Agent, Bahrain, in connection with thi irregular action taken by Bahrain against Qatar, without any real justifica tion, and their unusual attitude towards 4/hen I took certain steps concerning- the affairs of my own town and within my territory. I made a fill representation of what had happened and ^ asked on what ground they have taken such actions which injured the feelings, broke the ties of friendship and disturbed the good neighbourly relations which existed between both parties. How I see that they have done a new tiling which may create further difficulties. I deem it necessary, therefore, to inform you that these matters may lead to affairs which would be advisable to avoid. Perhaps you will remember what I told you, in the course of convex sat-ion, airing your last visit wo Bo hah about haw ar • I said that Ha war is, by its natural position, a part of Qatar, and it is not hidden to anyone who is acquainted with geographical and natural conoition ano has seen the natural position of Hawar that it is, beyond doubt, a part of Qatar though It is a small Island separated by a shallow channel of water. But by its present position It is attached to Qatar, formed by It and belongs to it. I was astonished when in the last two days I heard that the Bahrain Government are making interferences at iiawar. I was surprised to see that the Bahrain Government, without any justific tion, have ventured to carry out affairs which may lead to difficulties and bad consequences. I consider that it Is not right to Keep quiet about their action which Is/transgressic© on tlie rights of others* I have said, previously that I do not like to create difficul ties and disputes unless l see a deliberate encroachment on iry country which is not admissible by any civil law, rules and regulations./I am bound to His Majesty’s Government by strong relations, friendship and alliance, and am aware that they are well acquainted with these parts and their political and geographical conditions, 1 deem it necessary to report the matter to you at the first instance and protest against the interferences and actions taken by the Bahrain Government at n a war, which is a dependency of Qatar. I trust that you will give this your full attention and do what is necessary in the matter so as to avkoid any trouble which may cause the breach of peace. I prefered to inform you, as it is necessary for me to do, and hope that you will let me know of your decision as it is necessary to take prompt action and to prevent the aggressors who ventured to take these actions without my knowledge, i am quite confident that you will, in order to keep the peace and tranquility, do what is necessary in the matter. , As u sual ending*.GOVERNMENT of INDIA.

It is time that on my visit to Dohah in February Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim stated that he had received information that the Bahrain Government were building and were drilling for water in Hawar, which they had no right to do. As I reported to you verbally I attempted to draw him by saving that I had always heard that the Bahrain Government claimed Hawar as part of the Bahrain possessions, to which he replied that it was true that they had occupied Hawar but that they had no ,f de jure rights' there. He changed the conversation immediately and it was evident/- (Signature) S. 44. M FP— 825S &amp;P—(M-1070) —14-9-34—10,000. (Designation)evident, that at that time he was by no means prepared to lay a formal claim to the Hawar group of islands. 4. I suggest that in reply to the present communication from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim I should write and inform him that though the Bahrain Government possessear a prima facie claim to the Hawar group of islands which is supported by their formal occupation of them for some time pastj His Majes ty's Government would be prepared to give consideration to a fomal claim by him provided such a claim were supported by a full and complete statement of the evidence on which he relied in asserting Qatar sovereignty over this group of islands. I should ask him to forward his statement of evidence with the least possible delay, and if I can receive orders on this re ference before my departure for Dohah on the 29th May 1938 I would take the opportunity of impressing upon him verbally the necessity for speed. Meanwhile it may pertiaps be cfesirable to remind him that the Bahrain Government are in point of fact in occupation of the Islands and that His Majesty’s Government would not be prepared to prohibit or restrict that occupation unless and until a contrary claim were proved and accepted. While therefore his claim is under consideration he must en sure that his subjects do nothing which might lead to hostili ties with the Bahrain subjects now in Hawar. 5. These suggestions will I think be in consonance with the accepted position that Bahrain possesses a prima facie title to the Hawar Islands, but that any contrary claim raised must be decided on its merits. It remains for consideration whether at this stage it is necessary to inform the Bahrain Government officially (I have done so unofficially) that the Shaikh of Qatar has raised a claim to Hawar, or to call on them to pre pare a fomal statement of their claim in rebuttal. Personally I incline to the view that it is not at present necessary to * call/-call on the Shaikh of Bahrain to prepare a statement of claim with evidence in support, as it remains to b e seen whether the Shaikh of Qatar can in fact produce any evi dence in support of his claim other than a mere reference to geographical location, which presumably will not by itself serve to contest the Bahrain claim supported, as it is, hcL physical occupation.

C.I.E., Ruler of Qatar, to Mr. H.Weightman, I.G.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments. I have received your letter No.c/324 of 1938 dated 20th May 1938 corresponding to 20th Rahi al Awwal 1357 and noted its contents on the subject of v/hat I had written about the islands of Kawar. I am very grateful to you for the good expressions contained in your letter and I am also thankful to His Majesty f s Government v/ho will, as you said, decide the matter in the light of truth and justice. I was confident oi and relying on the justice and equity of His Majesty 1 s Government who are famous for these things in all instances. They deserve all thanks and appreciation and I hope that they will continue to be successful. I read you letter very carefully and beg to reply as follows You said, ?T In actual fact by the occupation of the islands by the Bahrain Government for some time past they have a prima facie claim to them”. 0 ? political Agent, I do not think that the Bahrain Government have any legal proof which justifies such a claim by them. I also think that, as you are aquamted with the political situations, you do not really believe that such a claim is genuine, as the Bahrain Government were not in formal occupation of these islands for some time past. It is a clear fact that the islands of Hawar are still a dependency of Qatar as other similar islands. The Bahrain Government have only recently occupied them which fact made me move in the matter and submit protests against it. I remember that when I discussed the matter of Hawar with you, I said that Hawar is one of the islands of Qatar and objected to the claim of the Bahrain Government to these islands.You must be aware that the islands of Eawar, as other islands, promontories end coasts of Qatar, have not undergone anything that would change their position or give cause for anyone to claim them. I, therefore, was astonished at the steps taken by the Bahrain Government recently without my knowledge by visiting and interfering in Eawar without having, as far as I understand, any proper justification. I do not know on what ground the Bahrain Government took such steps in these islands recently which made me object against them. 0 f Political Agent! for a long time this island was free from any interference or under takings which attract attention and cause resentment, but remained like other islands. Borne fishermen, however, visit this island when they go to the sea for fishing as they do in other islands which is considered a usual practice. When I heard of the recent interference in the islands of Hawar by the Bahrain Government which is under my sovereignty owing to the fact that it belongs to Qatar, I could not put an end to it by opposition and stop their interference in this island although I was sure that I was right in claiming the ownership oi these islands. As I considered this an aggressive act, I deemed it incumbent on me to bring the matter first to your notice in view of the relations existing between us,and the right of His Iiajesty T s Government to look into such matters. I am sure that you will give a careful consideration to what I have explained on this subject. I hope that in such matters you will pay your attention as to the correct statements which agree with common sense, logic, rules and usages. I now submit my formal complaint against the steps taken by the Bahrain Government in islands belonging to others as follows 1. It seems hardly necessary for me to explain* A 4 the position of these islands in detail as you know them better. ' 2* In mi? capacity as Ruler of Qatar territory including coasts, islands, promontories and everything belonging to it, I have the right of ownership over these islands. 3. The Bahrain Government had not occupied the v openly islands of Eawar/for some time past. Since the date of declaring the independence of Qatar and recognition of my rulership over it, this island, as otiier islands, has been belonging to Qatar. The Bahrain Government were not in occupation of it until recently when they openly interfered there. Tuis made me object and submit my complaint to you. 4. As it is clear that Hawar is considered as an island oi Qatar and within its territory and has not been subject to any change which would alter its political position as required by customary rules, what authority the Bahrain Government have to claim it and on what ground they are justified to take sued acts, 5. I request you to look into this matter carefully as it is my duty to request His Majesty’s Government to note this complaint and restrict the Bahrain Government | from unlawful interference in the rights of others as far as there is no legal ground on which they can base such acts. As for myself, it is my right to object to any act undertaken by the Bahrain Government in islands which I consider to be belonging to me. As you have drawn my attention to the absolute necessity of ensuring that my subjects should not do any act which may lead to trouble with Bahrain during the period in which the question of , Hawar is under consideration, I also request you to stop the acrivities and interferences which the Bahrain Government! » j are undertaking in Hawar islands until the matter is decided by His Majesty’s Government in the light of justice and equity as you have said in your letter. I trust thatHis Majesty’s Government will administer justice and equity and tiiat you will do so in the present circumstances so that the present matters may take one and the same course until the facts become clear. I hope that you will pay- due attention to this matter as the object of all of us is to maintain peace and tranquility. Usual Ending.The Hawar Islands. —- tfi 7 ' &gt; 1. This group of islands consists of one large island, approximately 11 miles long and at the widest point about 2 miles wide with an area of about 17 square miles, and a number of smaller islands and rocky islets which are adjacent to Hawar island* A list of them, with the numbers of the beacons on each of them, is attached* The beacons are stone pillars about six feet high sur mounted by iron poles on the tops of which oil drums are fixed* The drums are painted red and white, the Bahrain colours. Hawar means n a young camel w and the island is locally known as the offspring of Bahrain island which it resembles somewhat in shape* g* On Hawar island there are two villages one at the north end and one at the south end. In each village there are about twenty stone houses At various places on the island there are water cisterns, some are cut in the rock and others are built of stone and gutch in the centre of natural depressions. These cisterns are of considerable age but in most cases it is known by whom they were built* There are three or four cemeteries in the island one is close to an area which appears to have been cultivated at one time as there is a group of date palms still existing* The cisterns, when rainfall is normal, provide a water supply for the people of Hawar but if the rainfall is small water is brought in boats from Bahrain, not from ^3* The island is rich in gypsum and contains good sand which is used for building in Bahrain and also a particular type of round pebbles which are not obtainable elsewhere* These substances are brought by boats to Bahrain* There is very good grazing when rainfall is normal. At Deira As Shamaal, the northern village, there is a sheltered harbour for launches and sail ing boats, where normally about a dozen craft are to be seen, a stone pier 12 feet wide extends from the shore to the deep water about 400 feet from the land* On the high ground above the bay there is a stone fort with a tower, which is visible in Bahrain, where the police post is stationed. An attempt is being made to drill an artesian well on the edge of the bay but water has not yet been reached. 4. Hawar has been occupied by the subjects of the Ruler of Bahrain since shortly after the Khalifah conquered Bahrain, which was in 1783. The principal families who lived in Hawar are of the Dawasir tribe whose headquarters in Bahrain are Zellaq and Budeya. At no time have any Rattan subjects lived in Hawar. The late Ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Isa, used, until he became too advanced in years, to pay an annual visit to Hawar. On one occasion, about thirty years ago, when Shaikh Isa was at Hawar a large detachment of Turkish soldiers were ship wrecked on the island. Shaikh Isa had them conveyed —-3- i &amp; It A/ conveyed to Bahrain and thence by steamer to their destination. ?or this he received the thanks of the Turkish Government. The authority of the Bulers of Qattar has never been exercised in Hawar. Disputes, which were frequent, between the people of Hawar, regarding fishing rights and grazing have always been referred to and judged by the Ruler of Bahrain, the Bahrain Shara Courts and, latterly, the existing Civil Courts. These cases can be produced. In the past the 'fidawis' of the Shaikh of Bahrain were sent when necessary to arrest people of Hawar when they were required to appear before Bahrain authorities. Since the present regime summonses are served in the usual way on the inhabitants of Hawar, pro clamations of the Bahrain Government are exhibited on a board in the village and when necessary the police who are stationed at Hawar produce persons whose presence is required in Bahrain. 5. In 1327 a serious dispute took place between Ahmed bin Shahin A1 Dosri who lived in one village in Hawar and Butti bin Sulman who was one of the headmen of the other village, all of them Bahrain subjects, regarding certain rights in Hawar. The case was tried in the Bahrain Court and judgment was given by the Ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Isa, and the Sunni Q^di, Shaikh Sheraf bin Ahmad. A photograph of the judgment, which is preserved in the Record Office of the Bahrain ^ ^ Government, is attached. L Ct-- * t. ? Gkj /ChXu*. ei i jf / f *u.t ^ My*In the following year another dispute between Ahmed bin Shahin and Ahmed bin Saad, both of Eawar, regarding fishing and other rights in Hawar, was judged in the Bahrain Court and a photograph of the judgment, which is in the possession ^ and the Q^di of Bahrain, is attached* Fishing rights off the shore of Hawar and the other islands were originally granted to the people of Hawar by the Shaikh of Bahrain* If these docu ments are available they will be f6rwarded. The Hawar fish traps are registered in the Land Depart ment of the Bahrain Government as are all other fish traps in Bahrain waters* 6. The people of Hawar are subject to the Ruler of Bahrain and to all the laws and regulations of Bahrain, in addition no donkeys are allowed in Hawar without written permission from the Bahrain Govern ment and Bahrain subjects are not permitted to quarry gypsum in Hawar without written authority from the Bahrain Government. The intention of this restric tion was to prevent the supply of gypsum from being rapidly exhausted* 7* The people of Hawar most strongly resent any suggestion that they are not the subjects of Bahrain living within the dominion of their Ruler* At no time have they admitted any allegiance to the Q,attar Shaikhs nor, until now, has the Ruler of Q,atar by any action or by any implication inferred that he has rights over the Hawar islands. Bahrain Government, signed by the RulerThe Hawar Islands. This group of islands consists of one large island approximately 11 miles long and at the widest point 2 miles in width, with an area of about 17 square miles which is known as Hawar island and also a number of islands and rocky islets which are adjacent to Hawar island. On each of the islands there is a stone beacon about 6 feet high surmounted by a pole on the top of which is an oil drum painted red and white, the Bahrain colours. The beacons are numbered as follows 1 . 2 . 3. 4. 5. 6 . 7. 8 . 9. 10 . 11 . 12 . 13. 14. 15. 16. South Sawad. (Sawad ■ Black) A1 Wakara (1) (Hawk’s stand) ' U) n (3) Bu Sedad rocks, four rocks.

Tue reierence to evidence, however, had evidently caused hira scale concern, as he demanded the ri^ht to see t f he Bahrain Governments counter-claim, M in order to enable him to rebut it”. I replied that I was unable to give him an assurance that His. Majesty f s Government would agree to any such procedure, and that in my own opinion it was impossible to contemplate a procedure enabling each party in turn to traverse the arguments, comiter-arguments, rebuttal, counter rebuttal and so on of the other, since this would render a decision impossible in his life-time or in mine. In my view it was sufficient for His iiajesty T s Government to have before them the claims of the two parties supported by the evidence on which they relied. These, with the information His Majesty’s Government themselves possessed, would be adequate for a just and proper decision to be reached. 3* \ I then turned to the request made in the Shaikh’s second letter that(in effect)the Bahrain Government should be ordered to evacuate the Hawar Islands pending a decision of tne dispute. I explained that the Bahrain Government are now,and have been to my personal knowledge for many months past, in actual occupation of the islands. I could offer him no hope that His Majesty’s Government would disturb the status quo while his claim was unuer consideration; it was common practice that when a person laid claimjf to property in the actual physical occupation of a second party, that party was left in possession until the new claimant had established his right before a tribunal. This would be the position in Hawar, and it was for him to ensure that none of his subjects caused disturbance by an attempt to upset it. I stated that I had heard rumours (which 1 could not believe; that his son Bhaikh Hamad contemplated an ar^ed raid on Hawar. This^botn of them denied hotly, but my reference to a very vague and unsubstantial rumour was deliberate since the Shaikh, his family and his- 3 - Secretary realise timt I know perfectly well there will be no raid or disturbance unless they themselves or ;&gt; 'anise it. 4 * I n regard to the substance of the Shaikh of Qatar’s claim, it will be observed that it consists of (1) a bare assertion of sovereignty ana (2) the affirmation that the Hawar Islands are part of the geographical unit of . atar. evidence is offered of formal occupation by Qatar, no mention is made oi* collection of taxes, of sale of fisning rights, oi tne exercise of judicial authority, or indeed, of the performance of any function which might denote sovereign rights* 1 request instructions whether I shoulu demand from the Bahrain Government a formal statement of their side of the case, with the evidence oh which they rely. I have in fact y'f received a preliminary statement from the Adviser to tne Bahrain Government, &amp; copy oi which 1 forwaru for information. (He is so iar able only to supply one copy oi the photographs). I have not acknowledged receipt, since the Bahrain counter-claim has not yet been called ior officially; nor should this document be regarded as a full and final compilation of the Bahrain evidence. There are various items in the document to which comment must be directed in due course, but I presume my comments should be postponed until formal demand is made for the Bahrain counter claim, and until I have satisfied myself , as m the case of the Qatar claim, that the counter-claim submitted is final and complete.

He stated he had no further proof to offer beyond the statements made in his petitions of claim. He thought he ^iould receive a copy of the Bahrain Government’s statement of claim 'in order to rebut their evidence'. To this I replied it was for i His Majesty’s Government to assess the^aiue of the evidence offered by both sides. If each was to be allowed to examine and criticise every statement made by the other - claim, count er-claim, rebuttal, answer to rebuttal, answer to answer to rebuttal and so on ad infinitum, the matter would never be settled. I impressed on him the need for controlling his sub jects while the case was under examination by His Majesty’s Government. I told him I had heard rumours (which I said I did not believe) that his son, Shaikh Hamad, was contemplat ing an armed descent on the Islands. He and Shaikh Hamad, of course, denied this, but as there will certainly be no disturbance unless it is organised by Shaikh or his sons, tte mention of this rumour should have the result of preventing 'accidents'. He asked that the Bahrain Government should be prevent ed from occupying the Islands until the decision of the case. I said I could offer no hope of this, as the Bahrain Govern ment was actually in possession at present, and the statu s quo would be maintained until a decision was reached. I told him he should arrange to reconstruct the beacon. , , Political Agency, No. C/384-1.a/29 Bahrain, the 14th June 1938. i To The Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.

You discussed with me the question of Hawar. I thanked you for informing me that you were going to investigate the matter very thoroughly so that the facts may become clear, and His Majestyls Government may be able to decide the matter in the light of justice and equity. You asked me whether I had anything further to say about Hawar other than what I had written in my letter which you, had with you. I replied that what I had written was limited n;o the present situation and in view of what you had written ori the subject to me.

In regard to those persons who went stealthily to Bahrain through disrespectful propaganda about whom I tola you, that from what I understood the Bahrain Govemment had prohibited all Qatar subjects from entering Bahrain without exception, other than those of whom the Political Agent made an exception in his letter. In that case how am I to take the action of the Bahrain Government in allowing the entry into Bahrain of certain Qatar subjects who went there with ill intentions and without my and your knowledge. This is contrary to what has been decided officially by the Bahrain Government themselves. On what ground the Bahrain Government pass an official order prohibiting Qatar subjects from entering Bahrain and then give permission to some of them. Had the Bahrain Government not found those persons as a means for carrying out their propaganda, they would not have given them permission. I request you to consider this matter and not to allow any Qatar subject to land xxx in Bahrain unless it is done through you or on your advice. The order should equally apply to all my subjects, the inhabitants of Qatar and others. Since the Bahrain Government have announced, through the Political Agent, the issue of a prohibition order against subjects of Qatar, the order is to be carried out properly. As I have already explained to you, the Bahrain Government, by giving admission to those who go stealthily to Bahrain, have an intention of promulgating a harmful propaganda with a view to disturbing the peace and tranquility. They(Banrain Government) have been sending messengers and money for duping the simplepeople and persuading tnem to disturb tne peace and cause xll ieelings. You may, of course, realise that harmful propaganda is not acceptable by honourable people and is not allowed by all laws. I hope you will consider this matter fully and by your sharp thought realise the consequences of such a thing. I have to inform you that should any of those who went stealthily to Bahrain come to any port of Qatar secretly by a Bahrain boat, I will be compelled, according to rules, to take legal action against the people and the boat which carries them.

You asked me whether I had anything further to say about Hawar other than what I had written in my letter which you had with you. I replied that what I had written was limited to the present situation and in view of what you had written on V \he subject to me.

His Highness Shaikh Hamad desires me to thank you for affording him an opportunity of studying the letter of Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim regarding which he has the follow ing comments to make. 2 * It is stated by Shaikh Abdullah that His Highness’s government has only recently occupied the islands. This statement is incorrect. The Hawar islands have been owned by the Buler of Bahrain and occupied by his subjects for over a century. It is true that a military garrison was only posted there recently, during the last two years, but the presence of a garrison was not considered necessarynecessary in the past when relations between Bah rain and ^atar were of a more friendly nature than they are today and the Hawar Islands were regarded as being free from the danger of interference by Qatar^ 3* The statement that 'some fishermen, however, visit this island when t hey go to the sea for fishing as they do in other islands which is considered a usual practice', is a ridiculous and inaccurate description of a place containing a long established settled community of Arabs living in per manent stone houses with their wives and families and their cattle, sheep and donkeys. It appears to imply that the Hawar Islands are only occassionally visited by casual fishermen whereas the fishermen who are referred to are some of the inhabitants of Hawar v/ho live in the islands and who go fishing from their home bringing back their fish to Hawar or sometimes sending it to Manama for sale* 4* Shaikh Abdulla refers to 'interference' by His Highness f s Government in Hawar* This is not a word which can be suitably used to describe the development by a Ruler of a part of his country, admittedly the Government of Bahrain has built roads, fortifications, piers, landmarks and beacons and has experimented in artesian well drilling in the Hawar Islands in a similar manner as has been done in other parts of Bahrain* 5« Shaikh Abdulla states that as Ruler of Qatar he has right of ownership over the Hawar Islands, if this is the case why has Shaikh Abdulla never exer cised his alleged right of ownership over the islands and their inhabitants? It would appear* appear that until about a year ago Shaikh Abdulla ignored tne existence of these islands and that he is now moved to make a claim to them believing that they perhaps contain oil* 6. From para 3 of Shaikh Abdulla 1 s com plaint it seems that he bases his claim to the Hawar Islands, 'since the date of declaring the independence of Qatar and recognising my rulership over it« TT The precise date when Shaikh Abdulla was recognised as Chief of Qatar is presumably on record, we believe it was between fifteen and twenty years ago. Is it to be inferred from Shaikh Abdulla’s letter that before the date of his recognition, fifteen or twenty years ago, the Hawar Islands belonged to Bahrain but that on fris official recognition he acquired them? If they did not, before his official recognition, belong to Bahrain to whom did they then belong? Shaikh Abdulla in his letter appears to have produced not a shred of proof or evidence in sup port of his claim which depends entirely on his frequently repeated statement that the islands belong to him* 7. In para 4 of Shaikh Abdulla’s com- ^&gt; plaint are the words, 'it is clear that Hawar is considered an island of Qatar'* To whom is it clear, except possibly to Shaikh Abdulla himself? Shaikh Abdulla can produce no proofs of ownership, no statement from the inhabitants or documents or incidents substantiating his claim of authority over Hawar. His contention is that because the islands are near his coast therefore they must belong to him* The geographical position of the 4 1 F». ■ '» m ' — ' ' ' “4- of the Hawar Islands is not in dispute, their si tuation is far better known to the rulers and people of Bahrain than to Shaikh Abdulla of Qatar because they are constantly frequented by the Shaikhs of Bahrain and their people whereas no member of the A1 Thani family has ever set foot on these islands* The Eawar Islands have never belonged to Qatar* They have belonged, as they do today, to the Rulers of Bahrain and the sole authority to be exercised over the islands was and is the autho rity of the Shaikhs of Bahrain* 8 0 The Hawar Islands consisting of one large island, two or three small islands and a number of rocky islets are a part of the Bahrain archipelago* They have been under the rule of the Shaikhs of Bah rain since about the time when the Khalifah conquered Bahrain, in 1783* The Hawar Islands were held by the Ruling family of Bahrain, A1 Khalifah, for many years before the A1 Thani family acquired any autho rity over the Qatar tribesmen* No ruler of Qatar, except t/he Khalifah when as rulers of Bahrain they had authority over Qatar, has exercised authority over the Hawar Islands or the inhabitants, either by imposing on the inhabitants taxes or fees or by summoning them to appear in the courts of the State* 9* The inhabitants of the Hawar Islands are subjects of the Ruler of Bahrain* They affirm this ^\'%Q fact in the petition which is attached to this letter, a petition which is signed by the leading men of Hawar* Their boats are registered in Bahrain and sail under the Bahrain flag, when they travel they travel under Bahrain Passports, their boats are registered in Bahrain and they pay boat registration-5- 0 1 f registration fees and diving licenses. The people of Hawar subsist on Bahrain and have no intercourse with Qatar, in years when the local water supply fails they obtain water from Bahrain, Those of them who are divers hold diving books which are issued by the Bahrain Government d 10 0 The authority of the Ruler of Bahrain is and always has been exercised in Hawar v/here no other authority is in force, both over the inhabi tants and over all things moveable and immoveable* The fidawis of the Shaikhs of Bahrain, in the past, and the naturs, notice servers and State Police in more recent times, have enforced the orders of the rulers of Bahrain in the Hawar Islands by displaying the official proclamations, by arresting malefactors, by producing from Hawar persons whose presence is re quired by the judicial authorities in Bahrain and by enforcing the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain or his courts over the people and properties in Hawar. 11. Particulars of cases tried in the Bahrain Courts regarding disputes among the people of Hawar about moveable and immoveable property are given .HP ItMr in the note attached to this letter* It will be appreciated that until the present regime no regular filing system or preservation of records existed and a search for old cases regarding Hawar has been unproductive and has only produced two ff V' f * 1 ? $ &gt; judgments dated 1327 and 1328 Hejrah. These judgments, signed by the late Ruler Shaikh Isa bin Ali and the Sunni Kadi of Bahrain refer to land rights and fishing traps at Hawar and the parties concerned were, during their lifetime, inhabitants— 6 — inhabitants of Hawar# 12# The villages of Hawar consist of stone houses, permanent buildings not palm huts, built oy Bahrain subjects# There are also in the various islands ancient stone cisterns constructed by the ancestors of the present inhabitants who were per mitted to build them by the Shaikhs of Bahrain in the past* The inhabitants of Hawar reside there permanently keeping their goods and chattels in their houses and their boats, when not in use, on the shore of the islands# 13# The Shaikhs of Bahrain frequently visit the islands# In about 1290 Hejrah Shaikh Isa bin Ali was staying at Hawar when a party of Turkish soldiers were wrecked there* He conveyed them to Manama and arranged for their transport to Hassa which was then Turkish territory. This incident is well known in Bahrain and described by authentic witnesses though documentary evidence does not exist# 14. In conclusion the rulers of Bahrain have held unquestioned sway over the Hawar Islands for over a century, their subjects are living in Hawar and recently an armed garrison has been stationed in Hawar# Hawar is undisputably in the possession of Bahrain# If the Shaikh of Q,atar has any proof of his claim to ownership he should produce it# I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant# Enel#-«e the under-signed are subjects of the Ruler of Bahrain, and give our confession and a statement of our real knowledge of Hawar Island. Hawar Islands belong to Bahrain from olden times V and ruled by the rulers of Bahrain. It is our dwelling place now and was the dwelling place of our fathers, forefathers and their predecessors from son to father since long time. We are all ruled by the rulers of Bahrain. No one had any control over our ancestors and their predecessors who lived in this Island except the rulers of Bah rain. We have in Hawar houses built of stones inherited by us from our fathers and their predeces sors. We are repairing them whenever there is a need for repair. We have our fishing nets built of stones from long built by our fathers, grand fathers and their predecessors which we are re pairing when there is a need for such repair. These are in addition to the temporary nets which we put up in Hawar sea near our houses for fishing during the fishing season. All these things had been done by our predecessors in this island who were subjects of the rulers of Bahrain. We submit this petition giving the above statement for informa tion.

Jabr did not produce any evidence; Ahmad produced many wit nesses which were accepted. Some of them from Al-Bu-Ainain of Askar, of Om Ashajar, Eyal bu-Soud, of Halah, such as Saleh bin Khamis, Bin Dhain, etc. All of these gave witnesses that Hawar belongs to Ahmad bin Shahin and has been in his possession. They have confirmed that and so accordingly I have passed my judgment that they are the proper ov/ners, and nobody has any right to claim, dispute or disturb them in these property. Those who have rights in the lands should have their rights, the lands have boundaries known by those interested in them. Anyone who interferes with the property of others will be punished by the ruler. Our Prophet said; 'No interference and no harm; the ruler is the spear of God on the earth. He is to prevent agression and punish agressors by imprisoning them, etc. This is in order to prevent disturbance. Written and Sealed by Sharaf bin Ahmad. Servant of Shara Court, Bahrain. » %.

I stayed in the P.C.L. camp at Jebel Dukhan and found them all very cheerful. They have built a very pleasant small edmp and have nine or ten people there who seem to get on very well together and also with the Qatar coolies.

He complained that the Bahrain Shaikhs are very hostile towards him and are trying to seduce some of his Bedu from him.

The fact that although most people in Qatar quite like the old Shaikh they cannot bear Shaikh Hamad, his son, or Saleh al Mana f , both of whom try to loot them. However I said to the old Shaikh that I did not see that he had anything to worry about provided he kept his Bedu happy. This was a gentle hint not to hang on to all the oil money himself, as he has done hitherto. 4. The Shaikh raised the question of his armoured cars, SB. !? 03 ; r , es P° nd ® r ; ce nesting with your 0 and I told him that the Printed letter No. C/737 dated the 5 7th Cctooer 1938. ^ ^5 matter was under considera tion and that I hoped to fly across his territory shortly with some experts who would be able to advise whether armoured cars would be of any use or not. This I should be doing tomorrow iM^l Price. The Shaikh mentioned the point that though His Majesty’s Government had undertaken to give him protection against outside aggression by means of the Royal Air Force, still they do expect him to co-operate; and he felt quite sure that he could co-operate best by having armoured or armed cars. He was not very much in favour of the Kuwait type, though I pointed out to him that really heavy armoured vehicles would never be able to get round his country. 5. He protested against the continuance of the Bahrain boycott, and I must say that I sympathise with him. When we have finished here with oil concessions and ’’reforms” I hdpe to try to induce the Shaikhs to resume normal relations with Qatar. It will not be an easy task for they will never forget Zubarah. Yours sincerely, Sd/- H. Weightman.EXTRACT FROM IIMDIA OFFICE EXPRESS LETTER W P.Z. 1111/59, DATED THE 1ST MARCH 1939.

For these reasons,and after coming to know of the sophistications which were got up by the Bahrain Government in this matter, it became necessary to have time ana opportunity to reply to that.

After compliments, I ^ f r / Relerence your letter No. C/9 dated 5th January 1939(14.11.57) enclosing a copy of the Bahrain Government’s letter about the Hawar islanus. I thank you for the short opportunity which you have affordea me to enable me to examine ana investigate what has been written by tne Bahrain Government on this matter. Before commenting on the letter I beg to say:- FORWORD. Selfishness and covetousness are two of man’s natural instincts, on which nations have proceedea since times immemorial, and which urive some people after their covetea objects. This is due to some imaginations and fancies, which develops to such an extent as to be ultimately mistaken for facts, which enshroud the minds and affect the hearts and senses. Then he would think that sophistication is one of the laws of selfishness which can legitimately be used to justify his actions when he cfialienges the rights of others and takes possession of their properties without any real justification. This is what has prompted the Bahrain Government to extract out of sophistry a few weak allegations for use as a ladder on which to ascend to their coveted object. But they should understand that any Government, however tyrannical ana powerful they may be and in whatever manner they may stray from the right path, cannot hold on to false pretences for unjustly taking possession of tne properties of others if those who will prevent them and compel them to turn to the right path are available. 1 therefore request you to reflect on tne matter ana to subject it to careful examiniation. I invoke your consience, in the investigation of right and justice, to turn your careful attention to the well balanced ana trueana true facts which will reveal tue rigut to you if you review them carefully by the scales of the mind, as to the present situation of the matter and tne requirements of its circumstances and ambiguities in a manner which conforms with conditions prevalent in these parts, ana with tne customs wnicn are familiar to its inhabitants. ue believe mat tne might of justice is strongly fixed over and above tne outwara appearances of allegations, and cannot be erased by sophistry or be shaken by well pollsued allegations. Alien you view the matter from its true phase the facts will be clear to you ana all the sophistications, which with the support of falsehood are intended for satisfying the greed will crumble down. Right is more deserving of being followed; I submit my comments on the letter of the Bsnrain Government. U.E.Translation ol cornments on the statement of the Bahrain 'jovernment in the case of Hawar Islands. Submit tea by the Ruler of Qatar. 1- The Bahrain Government try to find out justification xor one action tney dared in the Hawar Islands but they fall into confusion about the matter. They lose the point and then have recourse to sophistication and the obliteration of facts wQ which no one, who has the least knowledge of conditions which prevailed in these islands in the past, would support In studying their memorandum and examining its contents I uici not iind out that they have put forward even a fraction oi the evidence which can be considereu as sufficeint proof from an indicative point of view, or a proof which can be a likely arguement to justify their recent action in islands whicii form a^part oi Qatar. All that it contained are some- far ietched allegations which are remote from the truth. R* The Bahrain Government deny my statement that they did not occupy tnose islands except in recent nays, and they allege tnat they Delong to the Ruler^of Bahrain, and that they were inhabited by tneir subjects for more tnan a centnary. Then tney recant ana contradict their own allegations and support my statement in saying that their military detachment was only recently stationea there. 3. Whoever views this allegation will find it not only illogical but also far away from sensibility, and will be surprised by its strangeness and bare-faced contradictory appearnce. That islands which are so described by the Bahrain Government, and which they claim as belonging to them ana inhabited by their subjects for over a centuary, snoula remain for so long un-occupied by their military detachment and without any representative, except recently, is an allegation which makes one laugh because of its extraoruinary strangeness. It is unnecessary for me to give more instances about the weakness of this allegation, its remoteness from the truth and its illogical foundation^because every one who lias knowledge them. rtrmrmI of logic will not agree with tnem on this point# Nothing out of the words M cooperation fT and M brother- liness T ’, vhiich they put forward to justify the same, could be usee, as a basis for the foundation of their claim. Because, iiaa tne nawar Islands been as described by tne Bahrain Govt., inhabited by their subjects in a permanent manner, or that it can be described as townj^and villages or anything approaching tne same, then ’’cooperation' and 'brotherliness' would have not prevented tneir Government from taking tne necessary steps required by the conditions of towns so described as belonging to them^as it is in all countries of tne world. But as the truth is different from that mentioned by the Banrain Govt, it becomes necessary that they should justify the actions ana liberties which they have taken in a land wnicn does not belong to them by putting forward conclusive proofs which should be logical, agreeable and acceptable to a living conscience. But it tney use false allegations ana obs^cure methods for unjustly taking possession of the lands of others then we will not give ino 5. The Banrain Government describe my statement that tne islands are an abode for fishermen as 'a laughable allegation and an untrue description,' and they allege tuat 'they are inhabited villages, established since a long time, with firmly built stone houses, permanently inhabited,for more than a centuary, by the subjects of the Ruler of Banrain and tne sud jects oi his ancestors with their wives, families, herds and boats'. I am surprised by such concoctions and by the bold denial of the firmly set facts. Even more strange than these condradictory remarks, which are apparent in all tneir allegati ons, is (the fact£) that while they deny my statement that fishermen;frequent the islands yet they recant and confirm it thus: 'tiiat shows that the islands are frequented by fishermen who are from among the inhabitants of Hawar Islands'. If tne Bahrain Government show their ignorance of the conditions of Hawar in these terms, and to the extent of drawing a hint from my letter tiiat fishermen frequent tnese islands— ana there are no other fisnermen than tnose to whom I referred above — whomJawar Islands are not in any way as described by the Bahrain Government. Because they are islands whose extent is from o square miles approximately at high tide. Moreover they are barren, without water and unfit as a pasturage for herds, approaches the meaning of this word, and generally un-frequentd ann to whom reference was made by the Ruler of Bahrain himself, biow nothing besides what we have mentioned. The uesription given to it by the Bahrain Government, as mentioned above, does not conform with any of the truth either because of their ignorance oi those islands or because they want to deny the they cover these actions by a robe of falsenooa, and then they call their action by a name through which they try to cover the right with a screen of the wrong, and the worn 'trie cultivation, usea in any way. Tlie Banrain Government have confessed, in tneir memorandum, that their military detachment camped on tneir behalf in the Hawar Islands only in recent days, and have built strongholds, roads, wharves ana signposts recently. The confession oi the Bahrain Government about their having ta^en tne liberty oi taking those actions in the Hawar islands only in recent days is ^nf lie ting witn tneir allegation of owning those islands in the past, and with their description that they are a part of their state, as it impossible to concieve that islands which are so described by them, and which they allege are subject to them and form part oi their country ior more than a centuary, should remain all along those years without a detachment for security andcThe except by iisnermen who come from time to time , or who pull up tneir fishing boats (for 'a dry' or repairs) temporarily, and who then leave. All people who knew t,.epe islands since olaen times facts which are known to all, and to rely on sophistication. b * ^ Bahrain Government show surprise at my statement that tneir recent action in Hawar uas no justification, and o by a Ruler, oi part oi his domain' is a word which cannot beJim administration of justice, and to represent the Ruler of' Bahrain in those islands which they bewail as being part of tueir state, aha allege that it consists of villages inhabited by people with boats ana herds. We also observe, from another point oi view, clear contradictions in the memorandum of the Bahrain Government. A confession by them that the islands are owned by the Ruler of t&amp;tar is about clear, and that is by the fact that some incidents took place in the not far off past, between &lt; c atar and Bahrain, which are recorded in history ana in the memories of some living persons, which has shattered relations of 'brotherliness' and threatened interests! more th§4\at present. f^Pt^he fact that the Bahrain G-overt. did not mention there being any detachment stationed by them at Hawar islands under those circumstances, and during which time it was more necessary to bring out a detachment than it is now, and for the same reasons which the Bahrain Government now want to use as justification for the presence of tueir detachment, is conclusive proof that the Hawar Islands are owned by the Ruler of Qatar at least since that time and upto the present in which the Bahrain Government now try to use the presence of their recently stationed detachment as an excuse for taking Hawar Islands. Haa the Ruler of Bahrain kneww anything about this he would have alluded to it in his memorandum, which is in our possession. His silence about it is a considerable hint to our ownership of these is lands at that time ana that it forms a part of ^atar upto the present m spite ot tne recent actions which are trying to put off by A means of understanding. 7. The followign is one of the mislading allegations made by the Ban rain Government:- 'Why aid not Shaikh Abaulla use the right which he claims about the ownership of the islands. He was upto a year ago ignorant of there being such islands and only now stirred under the impression that they may perhaps contain oily This is a foolish saying; We extend an opportunity to the Bahrain Government to cite any instances of any action which they took in the past in Hawar Islanas and which we didV we wia not challenge; Have they taken any action or posse v &amp;s-ion of Hawar islands in the past, which they claim as their property and part of their state formed of inhabited villages for more than a centuary, which action will serve as a proof or will give a correct indication of their having owned the islands ? Haa we kngwwof any such thing we would have not challenged them when they wanted to take over the islands now, by using our right against them. The Hawar island is well knwon to all the people of Qatar least of all the Ruler; Can it be logically assumed that a Ruler should be ignorant of a part of his territory ? I leave the matter to Your Excellency’s sense of understanding to judge as to who is ignorant of the Hawar islands. Is it I who has aescirbea it according to tne true situation , or tne Ruler of Bahrain, who has described it as against its natural state and who alleges that it is formed of villages and buildings with permanent inhabitents, tneir families, herds and boats, and who has ,f reated a dome out of a grain' ? Unless, perhaps, the Bahrain Government had ' a revelation in the underground world'. Perhaps an opportunity might occur in the near future for Your Excellency to visit the Hav/ar Islands to enable you personally to see for yourself and ascertain who is the truthful amongst us, so that your judgement may be formed in the light of true facts. The reason which has prompted us to ask for the prevention of the Bahrain Government from the actions which they took in the Hawar Islands is not greed for the presence of oil but to prevent the Bahrain Government from taking a part of Qatar. 8. In article 6 of their memorandum the Bahrain Govrt. ask; To whom does the hawar Islands belong if not to Bahrain ? It would have been better had they asked: To whom does Qatar belong if not to Bahrain ?. Whatever can be said about Hawar can be said about the whole of Qatar, and we ask the Bahrain Government whether the Hawar Islands, from a geographical point of view, comprise of a part of Bahrain compi^ting it from the South or a part of Qatar completing it from the North?/ Our previous remark,about the independence of Qatar and the recognition of our rulership over it, carries its meaning which, if the Bahrain Government does not percieve, is not latent to those who have knowledge of situations in these parts. y 9. The Bahrain Government try to find out some means of geographical justification for including the Hawar Islands among the number of islands which form Bahrain, but they find nothing more than saying 'The situation of the Hawar Islands is undisputed. Its situation is more known to the Rulers and public of Bahrain than to Shaikh Abdulla the ■ do % Ruler of Qatar, because the Ruler and public of Baxi.rain frequent tnose islands whilest no one of tne al-Thani family had ever set foot over it'. This is a foolish saying which snows tne ignorance of its author about geographical / * situations. The Hawar islands are not more tnan a mile from Qatar and it. is only separated from Qatar, during high ticne, -4. d* L/ [ \ ■ V Jo ^ IO U) ) (f) ^ ' t Ij by shallow water from the sea, but during low ebb the snort distance between Qatar ana Hawar becomes nearly uncovered by sea water and so directly connected as to be about traverse- able by foot whilest^on the other hand^the Hawar Islands are tens of miles away from Baiirain separated by deep sea which forms the passage of sea communications, and which is the natural bounnry between &lt;gatar and Bahrain. Tne Hawar Islands are considered, from a geographical point of view, as a part which completes Qatar from the North. Any one who has the least primary knowledge of geography will agree with tnis. The tracing, by the Bahrain Government, of the geo graphical connection of Eawar to Bahrain by saying tnat the people of Bahrain frequent the islands or by saying that the Ruler of Bahrain had visited it - assuming that he had visited it once during his life time, although that has yet to be proved - is one which will make people laugh at this wonaer-, ful geographical knowledge which the Bahrain Government has invented. The allegation that no one of the al-Tnani family has ever set foot on it is refuteable. The late Shaikh Qasim has visited it many times and many others of tne people of■I of i^atar kadi visited it 10. Among the evidence put forward by the Bahrain Govert. in tneir memorandum is t^at the pearl-fishermen of Hawar take their pearl-fishing (account) books from Baiirain, by which means they aim at creating Hawaris, and to take them for being their subjects. But, qq they forget that those to whom pearl-fishing carry sucn books; the people of Hasa, Nejd and Qatar, who follow the pearl-fishing trade in Bahrain, all Bahrain Government to take possession of the lands of their because their carry books ? This is an arguement which the Bahrain Government lias found in 'tue world of investigations'. gations, carried, out by them, fctr old cases refering to Hawar, • a dispute between two persons 28 years ago. This constitutes all the evidence put forward by the Bahrain Government which they think can be relied upon to satisfy their greed in the Hawar Islands. When we cast an investigating look over these two cases we find that the ^aohi of Banrain aid not give the least indication about the nationality of the two litigants. Therefore they are of unknown nationality and they may be of any other Arab State. This assumption is strengthened by the fact that disputes arise frequently between Muslims in otner taken place in their own country and by their own ^aahis, that is because the Islamic Shara T a law is the same on all points ^ j t a, and by common consent and can take place in any place where the Shara’a is recognised as if it is one law for all. This is a practice which is confirmed and practiced in our state and i: g, ^ not Hawaris ? Moreover pearl-fishing books cannot be taken as proofs; all those who go to Bahrain with the object of they refer as taking pearl-fishing books are Bahrainis and Y\yJ ^ carry such books at Bahrain, has it also ever occured to the T) tT\ iri 'V* O /-V v-r -Lr* VA Vrt _/•&gt; -4- h-K. - 4 - —. 1 -r- ^ ^ . x ^f ^ 1 _ ' 11. The Bahrain Government frankly admit that the investi as is alleged by them, did not result except in the finding of two decisions made by the suimi Qadhi of Banrain in respect of countries than their own and tney go to the Qadhi of the Shar f a vn o registers their cases and gives his decision which becomes valid ana excufeable. between the two litigants as if it mdand in Nejd, T Oman and other parts of Arabia, thus it is possible for the Qaahis of Nejd to decide between ! 0nian subjects, and for the Qaahis of Qatar to decide between Nejdd subjects and register their cases. This practice was also prevalent in Bahrain until a certain time past. Assuming however, for arguement f s sake, that the two persons,between whom a decision was given, are Bahrain subjects who have fishing traps near Hawar or of those who frequent the islands for this purpose, yet,this aoes not show in any way tnat Iht the Hawar islands are owned by the Ruler of Bahrain or tnat it is subject to him. If we take tnis arguement for granted, than^t would follow tnat each Government who have subjects in another country can claim, that country as belonging to them. This, I believe, is an arguement whicn tne Ruler of Bahrain himself will resent if any claim arises about a part of Bahrain in such a way. Any sane and right thinking person will not associate himself with the acceptance of such actions which are irregular and away from every known law. 12. In the memorandum of the Bahrain Government there was a petition signed by some persons of the Bawasir, whose number does not exceed twenty^alleging that they are the subjects of the Bahrain Government, and in whicn they have put some false allegations. Ae confirm that these persons, who are mentioned in the petition, have no more connections with tne Hawar Islands than their being fishermen who frequent Hawar in the fishing seasons. We have many persons who tender evidence that their allegations are false and that tney are no more than fishermen as is referred to above. As to their real dwellings ana places ana tneir pearl-fishing boats, these all are at Bahrain ana its districts as you will find confirmation of this statement in the enclosed documents. In this connect ion I I may mention| that a family of the Bawasir tribe who live at al-Zalaq when they used to frequent Hawar for fishing purposes they were attacked at^place and they put a complaint before my late father Shaikh Qasim who heard their complaint and decided against those who lave attacked them on the ground that the attack took place in his own territory. This incident is known to some individuals and there was no- 9 - no custom of recording sued incidents, as they are dealt &gt; 1/1 tn orally we nave no record —fee-same, but there are reliable witnesses who will give their evidence about the same. X-5 r 13. Now that I have put forward my comments on the statement ol the Bahrain Government in this matter in which tne^ rely on a lew individuals of Zala^ who may be of it T s -( ,alaqinj subjects or it may be that they come to these islands (SECljJl^for settlement in winter for iisnig, like others, v/no are subjects of Saudi Arabia, do. Then, would it occur to the Government of H.M.King Abaul nziz to claim tue islands because some ol their subjects lived on them and -built dwellings and water reservoirs. \ In order to know the local situation it would be necessary for Tour excellency to turn your attention to the fact that there is nothing strange about the action of some lisuermen by living in an island which belongs to Qatar or any other Government, or that such fishermen are subjects of one Government or the other. This is a widely prevalent custom, and one which is natural anu cannot change through change of times or places, and one which is in accordance with relevant conditions and situations in these parts, and to which the people are accustomed and agreeable. The/faith of the nulers of Arab states, and the exchange of mutual good neighbourliness, humanity and the love for the well being of all,coupled with the customs, conditions and situations refered to above, are all matters which prompt the rulers to leave the islands free, as long as such Islands remain,asnl have mentioned above, a refuge in which the aforesaid fisher men settle during winter,for fishing by setting fish traps ana nets on the shores of the islands as fishes are found there in abundance and are a source of great profit to the fishermen who find it necessary to remain on these deserted islands for a long time and which also necessiates them to build dwellings and water reservoirs as there is no water available on the islands. The rulers of these islands saw no reason for interfering with the affairs of these fishermenfa th V .i‘h ’ i /LAS' o 0 /■ y ,■ . x s , 44 ijj P..O*'/ y, / h ^ because they are causea by tne aforesaid conditions* The above mentioned conditions ana customs are the cnief reasons for not depriving these poor seamen of their means of 0 livelihood. The Rulers also saw no reason for such prevention since such conditions prevail not only in Hawar but also in most other islands. We cite as an example the island of Zakhnooniyyah which is in Saudi Arabian territory near f Ugair, ana which is frequented by the Duwasir and others, as they frequent Hawar, who have set up fishing traps and nets, and raised up dwellings as is in Hawar. In fact the conditions of Hawar are comparatively the same as that of Sakimooniyyah 5 yet the Saudi Arabian G-overnment saw no harm from the condition mentioned above, and that is because they saw no reason for preventing persons who under such conditions settle on the islands, or for taking any other steps against them. There are pc a number of islands in ! 0man, on the southern side of Qatar, which are inhabited by persons from ^atar who go to settle there in winter and return in summer, and in which they have built stone houses, water reservoirs ana mosques, ana in which they have set up fish traps and nets. Their houses and traps are there upto tnis hour; Would it, then, occur to us to claim these islands of our neighbours because some of our subjects go to settle there every year ana because they nave built houses and set up traps there ? Would any one in the world agree witn us if we raise tne same plea as that of the Ruler of Bahrain for claiming the rights of our neighbours only because our subjects are in their territory ? Gan the settlement of foreigners in other people’s countries be taken as a reason for their country to take possession of the territory in which- they settle ? Unless, perhaps, this is a new invention which the Bahrain Government want to put into practice, it would then be a different matter; would it then occur to the Bahrain Government to send their military detachment to Zakhnooniyyah ana take possession of it because some individuals of the Duwasir ana others of their subjects frequent it as they frequent Hawar ? Truely, this is ont of the strangest and most surprising matters. We refer such arguments to any one who has a sound mind and a living11 y ^ V l conscience and to whoever has knowledge of rules and regulations which are followed in all countries. Now that I have explained my comments and remarks,to your Excellency as fully as is required by the circumstances ol this case, I an confident that His Majesty f s G-overnment will stand impartially in this matter and carefully investigate and examine it for real facts from their true aspects, and will be guided by the strength of justice more than arguments and will not be misguided from the light of facts by any reason.

The documents in this case are now the following /Mo (1) Letter dated the 10th May 1938 from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim A1 Thani to me, of which a copy was forwarded to you with my Express letter No. C/312 dated the 15th May 1938.

This letter contained the Bahrain Government* s formal counter-claim. (5) The rejoinder from the Shaikh of Qatar now forwarded with this letter. I have made certain marginal comments on this. In addition mention should be made of letter No. C/180 dated the 28th April 1936 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Gover- / r -tfjfv o' ment, a copy of which was forwarded to you with my predecessor* s letter No. C/2YT dated the 6th May 1936. In this letter, which bears reference to the negotiations then proceeding for a con cession covering the Unallotted Area of the Bahrain possessions, the Bahrain Government formally stated their claim to sovereignty. 3. The Shaikh of Qatar*s claim, as set out in document No. 2, 4 , c&gt; k (a) A plain asseveration of sovereignty over this group of islands as over other islands adjacent to Qatar, the coasts, promontories and ’*everything belonging to atar'. (b) A formal denial that Bahrain had, until recently, occu pied these islands or exercised jurisdiction in any form therein. (c) A claim that the islands, by virtue of geographical pro pinquity, are an integral part of the Qatar State. ^ . j&gt; ! In addition to these, in submitting his rejoinder /r . (document No. 5) the Shaikh of Qatar has forwarded papers which purport to be statements by persons possessing local knowledge that the Hawar Islands belong not to Bahrain but to the Shaikh of Qatar. The value however of these latter documents is greatly diminished by the fact that the signatures on all of them are in /- U» v - i-3- in one handwriting, unsupported by thumb impressions or seals of the alleged signatories. Nor is any description of the alleged signatories given, their place of residence or reason for having special knowledge of the Hawar Islands. There is no suggestion that they are residents, whether temporary or permanent, of Hawar — and indeed there could not be; and to be brief, their testimony is to my mind entirely valueless. 4. A claim for sovereignty based merely on geographical contiguity is, as I understand it, of little practical value save possibly in respect of an unoccupied area of land or an island lying contiguous to or in the territorial waters of the State raising the claim. Were this not so an equally valid claim to the whole of the Qatar Peninsula might presumably be raised by the Saudi Government l In the particular case of the Hawar Islands, or at least of the main Hawar Island, there is sufficient evidence to show that they have been occupied, whe ther temporarily or permanently, for the past 150 odd years. It follows therefore that the fullest consideration must be given to the circumstances attending that occupation, to the nationality of the occupants, the authority they recognise and to evidence of the exercise of direct jurisdiction over them; while geographical propinquity cannot be held by itself to raise any special presumption favourable to Qatar. This I believe to be correct even though at low springs it is possible (as I am informed though I have not verified this by experiment) to wade from the Qatar mainland to a certain point on the main Hawar Island in about three feet of water. 5. The bare assertion of sovereignty made by the Shaikh of Qatar must be devoid of value in the absence of corroboratory evidence. The only evidence offered in this dispute is that produced by the Bahrain Government, which the Shaikh of Qatar in his rejoinder attempts to show to be either false or in capable of bearing the construction put upon it by the Bahrain Government. /-JL Government. I propose therefore to examine this evidence and make some attempt to estimate its value* Before doing so how ever it may be well to make some brief mention of the earlier history of these islands. 6. (a) In the Persian Gulf Gazeteer, Volume II, page 1513 it is stated that the Dawasir of Zellaq in Bahrain have houses in two places in the island which they use in winter. (Zellaq is a village on the west coast of Bahrain and the Dawasir of that place have lived there for generations). ^ ^^.&lt;1 y ^ (b) In paragraph 7 of letter No. 207 dated the 4th April 1909 the then Political Agent, Bahrain, stated that on a visit to Hawar he had been told by the Dawasir who were then in resi- i dence that they regarded Hawar as their own independent terri- tory, the ownership of the island having been awarded to them by the Qadhi of Zubarah more than one hundred years earlier. He adds that the Qadhi at that time was an official of the A1 Khalifah, who were then in possession of Zubarah, and it would seem to follow therefore that Dawasir ownership of Hawar derived directly from the authority of the A1 Khalifah. The Political Agent mentioned a written decision, which however now seems to have disappeared. I might add that on a recent visit to Hawar I received corroboration of this story, the local Dawasir claim ing that they had possessed more or less independent rights in Hawar since the days when the A1 Khalifah were in Zubarah. That the main island of Hawar has been inhabited for generations is evident from the fact that there are two quite considerable cemeteries in the island. I n 0 ; p 7. I have myself verified the accuracy of the statement made in the Bahrain counter-claim (document No. 4) that there are two villages in the main Hawar Island. These are quite small villages, occupied by about 35 and 20 families respectively, living in houses of the type known as ‘kubara*, i.e. built of unfaced stone and held together with mud and roofed with date palm. These are definitely more permanent constructions than f i oV&gt;^r&gt;mftnt a /_ |&gt;r --5- v^U /■•V fishermen^ ^arasties* (palm huts) and some at least of them are occupied throughout the year. Hawar suffers from the absence of a permanent water supply, since the cisterns to which reference is made in the Bahrain counter-claim are only full after heavy rain and are subject to loss both from evaporation and from leakage* There was, for instance, heavy rain in Hawar a month ago, filling the cisterns to the brim, but the local people informed me that this water would be exhausted within three months. Water therefore, during much of the year, has to be brought across from Bahrain and this naturally restricts the number of persons remaining there permanently and makes it necessary for them to send their goats (except a few in milk) and their cattle across to Bahrain. Nevertheless a few people do remain there throughout the year, though whether this is equally true of the past I cannot say. 8. The Bahrain Government claim, and the Shaikh of Qatar denies, that there is good grazing for flocks and herds in the Hawar main island. I can state, from personal knowledge, that in this respect the Bahrain Government are right. After good rain the island provides better pasturage than Bahrain itself and even this year, when the rain was very late, there are still to-day between 50 and 100 animals in Hawar. This point is of importance as supporting the Bahrain statement that Hawar is considerably more than a temporary refuge for fishermen. Similarly, it is quite true that the gypsum (or juss) which is found in Hawar is excavated under licence from Bahrain. In point of fact on my recent visit to the island the local Dawasir complained that the Bahrain Government were over-free with their licences and that the juss reserves were being rapidly exhausted. 9. Mention is also made in paragraph 9 of the Bahrain counter-claim of the pearling boats owned by the Dawasir of Hawar. I believe that Hawar owns only four, but these four were /-were drawn up on the beach near the northern village during my visit there last week and they are admittedly registered in Bahrain. Were the Dawasir purely temporary visitors to the island, with their permanent habitations in Zellaq, their pearling boats would not be beached in Hawar* Nor indeed would there even be fishermen there at the present time, since fishing in the surrounding waters is suffering from its sea sonal decline. ^ \W' 10. In their preliminary statement (document No. 3) the Bahrain Government state that the permanent fish traps at Hawar are registered in the Land Department of the Bahrain Government. This is not strictly accurate, since these traps have been under dispute for the past three years between mem bers of the Hawar Dawasir, and clearly registration cannot be effected until their dispute is settled. Nevertheless it is true that the dispute itself is before the Bahrain Sunni Shara Court and I have myself seen part of the record. The mere fact that the claimants to these traps, which have unquestion ably been in existence for several years, should refer their dispute to the Bahrain Government is of importance in indicat ing the exercise of jurisdiction by the Shaikh of Bahrain. Further and more important evidence of the exercise of juris diction by the Shaikh of Bahrain for years past is provided in the two judgments forwarded with the Bahrain counter-claim. These two judgments, dating from some thirty years ago, are of unquestionable authenticity and both of them relate to dis putes in regard to ownership of r, land and sea properties 11 in Hawar. The Shaikh of Qatar in paragraph 11 of his rejoinder seeks to show that these two judgments are of no evidentiary value since it is, he claims, common for Qadhis of one Moslem country to settle disputes between the subjects of another Moslem country. This statement is of course true up to a point in ,, personal H cases, but the Shaikh of Qatar would be the/--7- the first to deny that a Nejdi Qadhi, for instance, could settle a dispute between two Qatar subjects in respect of landed properties in Doha, 11. It may be acknowledged that owing to the adoption of more regular procedure in Bahrain than in Qatar, the Bahrain Government are in a better position to produce evidence of a judicial nature than is the Shaikh of Qatar. The record of a Bahrain case has for instance been submitted to me showing that processes were issued for the attendance of certain Hawar residents in a Bahrain Court seven years ago (i.e. long before the Zubarah dispute flared up, and before Hawar became of interest from the oil aspect) • It would be unfair to make too much of the Shaikh of Qatar’s inability to match this evidence, but it is noteworthy that he does not, and so presumably cannot, claim that he himself has ever decided a dispute in regard to property of any description at Hawar. 12. It may be worth while making reference to the point men tioned in paragraph 13 of the Bahrain counter-claim, in regard to the rescue at Hawar by Shaikh * Isa of Bahrain of a party of Turkish soldiers who were wrecked there. On my recent visit to Hawar I enquired from the older men whether Turkish soldiers had ever landed at Hawar and the story of this wreck was repeat ed to me in considerable circumstantial detail. It is of no great evidentiary value except as indicating that the Shaikhs of Bahrain were in the habit in the past of visiting the island. lb. To sum up. The Shaikh of Qatar has produced no evidence whatsoever. He relies solely on an uncorroborated assertion of sovereignty, on geographical propinquity and on the alleged statements of certain unidentified persons. Gn the Bahrain side there is evidence that the original occupation of Hawar by the Dawasir was effected under the authority of the A1 Khalifah, that the Zellaq Dawasir have frequented these islands for a grear number of years, that the courts established by the/-the Shaikhs of Bahrain have promulgated decisions in regard to disputes over property there, that questions of ownership of fish traps have been submitted to the decision of the Bahrain Shara Court, that seven years ago Bahrain processes were served in Hav*ar, that the boats owned by the Bawasir of Hawar are registered in Bahrain and that gypsum or juss is excavated from Hawar under licence from the Bahrain Government# I am not able to state definitely that these Dawasir have for the past 150 years occupied Hawar at all seasons of the year, though those now in residence there claim that this is so • On the other hand the cemeteries, the water cisterns, the ruins of the old fort which I have myself seen and the type of house in use all provide evidence of consistent occupation for at least the greater part of the year. And finally in the absence of any indication of occupation or of the exercise of jurisdic tion by the Shaikh of Qatar, the construction of a police post by the Bahrain Government there some 18 months ago, the build ing of a mosque in the northern village under the orders of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and the efforts made to drive an artesian well constitute, in the light of older history, a valid and proper assumption of constitutional authority on the part of the Bahrain Government. The small barren and uninhabi ted islands and rocky islets which form the complete Hawar group presumably fall to the authority of the Ruler establish ing himself in the Hawar main island, particularly since marks have been erected on all of them by the Bahrain Government.

The Under Secretary of State for India, Whitehall, S. W. 1. Sir, It is desired to recall certain correspondence which passed between the India Office and this Company in 1936 on the subject of the allegiance or ownership of the Hawar group of islands situated west - and within the territorial waters - of the Qatar Peninsula. k % ^ r X 2. A letter No. P. Z. 4582/3^’ of July 14th 1936, from Mr. J.C.Walton to Mr. J. Skliros states: 5, 0n the basis of the evidence at present before His Majesty’s Government, it appears to them that Hawar belongs to the Shaikh of Bahrain, and that the burden of disproving his claim would lie on any other potential claimant”. A subsequent letter, dated September 14, from Mr. M.C.Clauson to Mr. S.H.Longrigg calls particular attention to ”the limited nature” of this decision. It says: ”It is important that the Company should clearly understand that His Majesty’s Government’s position is as stated in the last sentence of that letter” (i.e., Mr. Walton’s letter above-quoted) 'namely, that on the basis of the evidence at present before them it appears to them that Hawar belongs to the Shaikh of Bahrain and that the burden of disproving his claim would lie on any other potential claimant. Perhaps you will be good enough to drop me a line to confirm that the Company appreciate the limited nature of the decision given by His Majesty’s Government in regard to this group of islands”. TheCompany duly confirmed this. 3. . In cpite^ however, of the provisional, or limited, nature of the ruling under reference, it appears that the Hawar group have subsequently come to be treated as de facto Bahrain territory: so much so, that both this Company and another have been encouraged to make offers to the Shaikh of Bahrain for a concession to include the Hawar group. It is reported also that the Bahrain Government have recently conducted a survey, built a police post, and otherwise asserted its authority over the islands. 4. It might appear from this that the matter is now finally judgeo. a no. should not be re—opened. That this is not the vie?/ of the Ruler of Qatar appears from the following extract from a letter received yesterday from the Company’s Bahrain Manager: ’’When I had an interview with the Shaikh of Qatar on 13th June the subject of Hawar islands arose. The Shaikh put for?/ard quite confident claims to t heir ov/nership as obviously part of Qatar. He by no means gave the impression that he is not serious in his claims, v/hich is the view usually put for?/ard by the Political Agent He said that he had written three times to the Political Agent without reply. Incidentally, the Shaikh of Qatar said that he regarded the Hav/ar islands as included in our Concession and not for disposal to an American Company”. 5. This attitude by the Shaikh of Qatar is entirely spontaneous and no steps whatsoever have been taken by this Company to produce it. The Company cannot, however, be indifferent to it and cannot but hope that it will lead, at least, to an examination of his claims, to v/hich, at first sight, considerable force is given by the extreme-3- propinquity of liav/ar to the coast of Qatar, and its relatively great distance from Bahrain. 6. It may he added that the original negotiator of the Qatar Concession in 1935, Mr.C.C.Mylles, was and remained under the impression that Hawar formed part of the Concession area. Whatever may he the final ruling adopted regarding the ownership of Hawar, the Company feels it most desirable that such ruling should cover authoritatively and in detail the distribution of territorial waters and reefs as between Qatar and Bahrain. Our information from Bahrain is to tne efiect that representatives of that Government are mapping reefs, etc, in waters immediately adjacent to the Qatar Peninsula and which would appear, under any but altogether exceptional circumstances, to belong to the Buler of Qatar. The fact that the latter has no British adviser and no Political Agent seems to create a certain danger that the Bahrain State - between which and himself very bad relations exist at present - may be encroaching at his expense, 0 which, in the present case, would also be the expense of the Company. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sgd. ) Managing Director.GOVERNMENT OE INDIA, EXTERNAL Affi&amp;KS _ Department, This is cm ORIGIN AL MUSS A GTJ, sent hy post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, hut intended to he treated, on receipt,' with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed.

You have pointed out that the information communicated to me, about Eawar Islands, in your prdecessorfe letter No. 0/639 dated 11th July 1939 (23rd Jamad-al-Awwal 1358) was a final decision and the matter cannot be opened afresh. Am I to under- ^ stand from Your Honour’s remark that all what I wrote and explained have not received your attention, and that my request to you to think aoout gleaning ihe facts and weighing them with the measure of realities has not evoked the least of your interest? I hold your Honour in higher estimation than to think that you take an easy view of the stripping off of a part of my land without my knowing the grounds on which His Majesty’s Government based their views in giving the decision which you have mentioned as being final. Whatever may happen my belief in the Justice of His Majesty’s G-overnment remains unshaken and I believe that the points of this matter have not fully become clear, and that the beguiles to which the Bahrain Government have resorted made the matter so ambiguous. Therefore it is impossible for me to keep quiet and to submit in such a matter. I shall continue the clarification of my case in a clearer and more argumentative statement and I am fully confident that His Majesty’s G-overnment will neither recognize nor agree to the encroachment upon even one of my rights, and the cutting off of a part of my territory as I cannot percieve that His Majesty’s G-ovemment would forcibly take the rights of one to give to the other because o of their honourable attitude in all matters. I therefore beg to inform Your Honour that I neither recognize nor submit that the Bahrain Government have the least lawful connection with the Hawar Islands, and that I view whatever measure which have been lately taken by the Bahrain Government as a challenge and an encroachment upon my rights against which I most strongly protest, and therefore, as I have informed you before, I reserve my rights to the Hawar islands while not recognising any measure f .'knowledge (18.11.39) fro He si dent. © &gt; # T 'iT L*r i ii&lt;wwMiMfcr-i riTii iii.n rw ■.

I shall be glad to receive your observations at an early date, and also your observations on the wider issue raised by Petroleum Concessions Limited in their letter of 26th February (copy enclosed) as to the dividing line between the interests of Bahrein and Qatar in the waters separating the two States. It v/ill of course be appreciated that the operations of exploration parties of the Bahrein Petroleum Company on various reefs and islets are of themselves no evidence of Bahrein ownership of the territory. 2. When this matter of the ownership of certain islands and reefs lying between Qatar and Bahrein came under consideration in April, 1933, in connexion with the negotiations for the Bahrein unalloted area, it was proposed, on the recommendation of the late Sir Trenchard Fowle (who was consulted during his visit to London) that the Sheikh of Qatar should be given an opportunity to state any claim he might wish to make in respect ox the Hav/ar Islands and Fasht Dibal. An extract from c.ic minute recorded by Sir Trenchard Fowle is enclosed. ^3 Before/Before this procedure was carried out the Sheikh of Qatar himself advanced a claim to Kawar, and in the ensuing correspondence (vide the Political Agent’s letter of 20th May, 1938, No.C/325-1.a/29) no reference was made to Pasht Dibal. We should he glad to have your views as to the question of the ownership of Pasht Dibal and to he informed whether you think it advisable that the Sheikh of Qatar should now he given an opportunity to state his claim, if he desires to do so.

Information has reached us that the Bahrain Oil Co. has recently carried out a seismographic survey of the reefs shown as Katah and Juradeh and Fasht and Disbal on Admiralty chart ’’Approaches to Bahrain”. These reefs, which are approximately midway between Bahrain Island and Qatar, are submerged at high tide and dry out in patches at low tide; other similar reefs exist in the Bahrain - Qatar waters and, as far as I am aware no record exists as to their ownership, although I admit Petroleum Concessions Ltd. assumed that some of the reefs belonged to the State of Bahrain and were therefore included in the area for which application was made by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. for a concession from that State. •The successful results obtained from our well at Dukhan (Qatar) render it highly desirable from Petroleum Concessions Ltd. point of view that the delimitation of the boundary between territories and territorial waters of the States of Bahrain and Qatar should be finally fixed as early as possible in order that our programme of exploration may be fully considered. I shall, therefore, be grateful if I could be informed of the present position of this matter. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H.H.Wheatley R.T.Peel, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. P.Z.1227/40. Dear Mr. Peel,Extract from Sir T.Fowle's Minute dated 5th April, 1938. I suggest the following action (a) a letter to be written by me as Political Resident under instructions from H.M.G. to the Sheikh of Qatar, informing him that in connection with negotiations which certain Companies are about to commence the question of the ownership of Hawar and Pasht Dibal must be decided. On the evidence at present available to these islands appear to belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. however have reason to believe that he, the Sheikh of Qatar, may wish to advance claims to these islands. If so he should submit these claims to H.M.G. within a certain period ( say two months) from the date of the letter, after which no claims should be considered. (b) a letter to be sent to the Sheikh of Bahrein enclosing a copy of the letter to the Sheikh of Qatar and explaining that when the latter’s reply has been received it would be communicated to him, the Sheikh of Bahrein. The latter will then have an opportunity of rebutting the claim of the Sheikh of Qatar should the latter advance one.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department. EXPRESS LETTER Confidential.

I propose to submit my suggestions when this map is received* 3. As to the Fasht al Dibal (Jibal) I find no evidence that the Shaikh of Qatar has ever claimed this reef. It is true that in paragraph 4 of his letter No.T/87 dated the 20th August 1937 my predecessor remarked that the culer of Qatar might lay claim to Fgtsgit al Dibal, but in point of fact he has not done so. The Mi P-400S&amp;P -(M480;—26-7-34 —2,00,000, 'Rahr»o - !n /-- 2 - i 5 © Bahrain Government erected their ^national mark” on this reef as well as on Qattah al Jarada in the winter of 1937-38 and no protest was ever made by the Shaikh of Qatar. Only last January when the Bahrain Petroleum Conipany were undertaking a seismographic survey of these reefs their dynamite barge went adrift in a storm from the lee of Qattah al Jarada and was salvaged on the Qatar Coast. I had some correspondence with the Shaikh of Qatar at the time about its return and it is significant that the Shaikh did not mention any objections to their operations on and around these reefs. If I am instructed to enquire from the Shaikh of Qatar whether he claims them he will undoubtedly accept the implied sugges tion and make a claim — neither he nor any other Arab Ruler would miss so admirable an opportunity. In vim however of his silence during the past two years since the Bahrain marks were erected I see little purpose in doing so. On the other hand I suggest that the uncontested exhibition of the Bahrain Government marks for so long a period is sufficient to estab lish Bahrain rights. I might mention incidentally that my information, which I have not personally checked by observa tion at high spring tides, is that a small part of both these reefs remains exposed at all states of the tide. 4. On the larger question of marking a dividing line between the interests of Bahrain and Qatar in the waters separating the two States I am unable to express any very definite views. Apart from the Hawar group, Fasht al Dibal and Qattah al Jarada, there are several small islets in these waters, outside the three mile limit from the Qatar shore, to all of which Bahrain laid claim two years ago by the erection of national marks. If it is accepted that this act, which has not been contested by Qatar, establishes Bahrain claim to over areas of sea within the three mile limit around each of the islets. This however still leaves a very considerable ty, then presumably Bahrain also obtains jurisdiction area /-i area of sea between the three mile territorial limits of the respective States which cannot properly be claimed by either* As you are aware relations between them are strained and I see little prospect of inducing either of them to agree to a negotiated division of their respective spheres of jurisdic tion. Presumably therefore in the areas outside territorial waters either the Bahrain Petroleum Company, as the client of the Bahrein Sheikhdom, or Petroleum Concessions Limited, as the client of Qatar, can conduct operations by way of explo ration or exploitation and it is conceivable that as a result an extremely ugly situation may arise* I can only suggest that the two Companies be invited to come to an unofficial agreement between themselves to avoid this in so far as non- territorial waters between the two States are concerned* Political Agent, BahrainTo: V&gt; Date:— Ref Political Agent, Bahrein* 2nd April, 1940. 84/1505/PH.

Political Agency, Bahrain From Major F.B. Prideaux, Political Ageht, Bahrain To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, X have the honour to report that the Turkish officials in Hasa, under their present Mutasarrif Mahir Pasha, are apparently making some effort to establish their autho rity more securely in the rather vaguely defined district over which they rule. 2. During the last week of February 1909, I heard that the Mudir of Ojair had been corresponding with the Dowasir tribesmen who periodically visit Zakhnuniya Island from Bahrain, with a view to getting them to admit their alle giance to the Turkish throne. A week or two later the rumour reached Bahrain that a Turkish salaried Kaimmakam had been despatched to Doha to take over the Government of the town (or whole Katar Peninsula, perhaps, as the Turks claim it) from Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and his deputy son, \ j: &gt;; Abdallah bin Jasim. 3. On the 8th March I proceeded to Lusail, Shaikh Jasim's headquarters, in the Agency Launch, and on the 10th the old chief rode in from the interior to meet me. I also despatched a Confidential reporter, who had accompanied me from Bahrain, by name Yusuf bin Ahmad Kano, overland to /-5. /- - 2 - Doha to collect all the authentic news possible connected with the object of my visit. 4. Shaikh Jasim received me very cordially, and appeared to be enjoying better health than I had wer seen him in before. He scoffed at the notion that there had been any recent ill-feeling between the Turks and himself, and declared that in the matter of the A1 bu Ainain disaffection at Wakra the Government had supported him quite as much as he could wish. The new official who had come to xhe fort at Bida* was, he said, connected with the troops, and though he had tried occasionally to give advice to Shaikh Abdallah (Jasim*s son), the latter had resolutely ignored him. When I observed that I had heard that the Turks were talking of assuming the Administration of the Customs, Shaikh Jasim said the revenue from this source was insignificant, being only about Rs.400/- monthly, and barely sufficient to defray the cost of t he bazar watchman. To please the British c,f.Persian Gulf Residency biary“) Government he had intro- Entry No. 1340 for week ending ) , t vm 7th July 1907 - ) duced a heav y tax t0 the trade in slaves and arms, but provisions and other ne cessaries were still admitted free. The latter part of this statement I am quite sure is not true, though the Shaikh went to the length of calling in my pilot, a Katar Nahkoda, to confirm what he said, and the man actually did so until we had left the Shaikh* s presence *. My messenger in Doha reported on his return that the Turkish official about whom we had been uneasy was ostensibly a Kazi, such as was attached to the Government Staff in Hofuf and Katif, and that his post in Doha would be quite a sinecure as no Arabs would ever go near him. We found on our return to Bahrain that this worthy had personally hurried off to Hasa via Bahrain to report the news of my visit the instant he heard of it in Doha.- 3 - 5. *011 the 17th March I left Bahrain again in the Steam Launch to visit Zakhnuniya Island which is situated close to the mainland about 10 miles south of Ojair. The most recent news about this place had been that the Mudir of Ojair had just visited the island, taking two or three military officers with him and a Turkish flag, and that he had asked the Dov/asir, whom he met there, whether they had settled anything with treir headman in Bahrain about coming under Turkish rule* The tribesmen replied that they had decided not to accept his (the Mudir’s) advice , as they might then perhaps lose their possessions in Bahrain. The Mudir afterwards proceeded to the ruined fort on the west side of the island, and ran up the flag. He then told the Dowasir that he did not ask of them anything, except to run up and lower the flag every day at sunrise and sunset, and when they all left the island to re turn it to him in Ojair. The Dowasir declined to comply with this request, and most of them returned to Bahrain soon after the Mudir’s departure. 6 . I landed on Zakhnuniya on the 18th March and found that there was only one boat of fisheafrnen on the beach. The men, Bahrain subjects, were living in two or three temporary mat huts at the southern extremity of the island and were engaged in fishing for sharks, swordfish etc., The dilapidated fort on the West side of the island was uninhabited, but I noticed that a Turkish flag was rolled up and attached to the bottom end of the halyard and fastened tight to the mast. The island is absolutely devoid of trees and brackish water is only obtainable in small quantities from shallow pits in the hollow of sand mounds. 7 . From Zakhnuniya I proceeded straight across the Bay of Bahrain to Hawar Island, where the Dowasir have two similar winter villages. Here I found in one locality a collection of 40 large huts under the authority of a cousin of the tribal principal Aprincipal Shaikh. This individual, Esa bin Ahmad Dosiri is also related by marriage to Shaikh Esa bin Ali, and he told me that he had at first thought that the Launch was a Turkish gunboat, a visit from which they quite expected to receive. He also told me that Zakhnuniya was undoubtedly a possession of the Chief of Bahrain, but that the Dowasir regarded Hawar as their own independent territory, the ownership of this island having been awarded to the trite by the Kazi of Zu- bara more than 100 years ago, in a written decision which they still preserve. The contesting tribe named A1 bu Tobais now is appa rently extinct, but as the Kazi of Zubara was in those days an official of the A1 Khalifah, the island would s em to be a dependency of the mainland State, which the Chief of Bahrain still claims as morally and theoretically his. 8 . On my return to Bahrain, I informed Shaikh Esa as soon as possible of the result of my trip, and he at once said that he desired to make a written protest on the subject of the Turkish occupation of Zakhnuniya. He remarked that his father Shaikh Ali had built the fort, with the concurrence of the Najd Amir, Bin Baud (who then ruled the adjacent main land), for the protection of his central possessions, a.tid that for some years hehafi kept a garrison on the island. When the necessity for this had ceased he had withdrawn his men, but at a latter date one of the Chief Dowasir had re paired the fort with his, Shaikh dsa’s, permission, and on account of the blood feud with the A1 Morra it was not very safe now to live on, but at the same time the Shaikh ob jected strongly, to the Turks annexing the place. Another possession, outside of the Bahrain Islands, which the Chief holds and from which he derives several hundred Hrans in revenue each year, is the reef situated about 7 miles fro* Budaiya (North-west town of Bahrain), which is actua 1 ly on the west or mainland side of the deep water channel from Katif to 01 air. This reef named Labaina includedJj-he^twoA m 5 &amp; ' islets (2 feet high), marked on the Admiralty Chart*0.l Bahrain to Ojair ,? which are respectively known as Labainat al Aliya and Labainat as Safliya. The Shaikh takes a tax from all the boats which collect turtle shell on these islets, and if the Turks maintain their right to Zakhnuniya, they may soon see fit to claim the two northern islets, as they claimed the Nazwa Sand-bank neat Katif in March 1907# 9# I enclose a translation of Shaikh Lsa’s formal letter of protest, and venture strongly to recommend that favourable consideration be given to it.

A long time has now passed while the state of affairs did not change but grew from bad to worse. 1 regret that ^ have to express to you my feelings of great pain for the prevalence of the state of affairs as it was in the Hawar islands, then you learn of the illegal actions vdiich are incompatible with rights and lawful duties you will excuse me for not keeping silent about a piece of land which I consider as an inseparable part of my territory while confident that the justice of the British Government does not permit or agree to the enctfroach- 1 C A ments of rights and territories by other than its lawful owners. On the 20th Habi II, 1359 (27.5.40) eight of the boats which usually anchor at Hawar came secretly to one of the shores of western Qatar and taking advantage of the absence of the guards, landed and secretly went inland where they committed irregular acts by awaiting some of my subjects of Qatar and talcing them unobserved to those boats, ^he following are the names of the persons who were taken:- 1.

I cannot, under any circumstances, be silent about the present state of affairs in the hawar Islands because the matter has reached a serious state about which it is | impossible to be xxiEHt; patient or to be silent, I v/rite this letter to inform four honour about this serious incident and to protest against this atrocious act so that Your Honour may know that there are important points on those coasts which should be preserved and safeguarded so that peace and security may prevail. If Bahrain boats be so daring as to come secretly in the form of a fleet full of men to those coasts during B the absence of the guards and land men on Qatar territory to commit irregular acts which might lead to disturbance of the peace in that area then I fear that the matter, since it reached such an extent, might lead to more serious results* 3y this letter g want to draw Four honour’s attention so that you may attach importance to this incident and take the necessary measures for the preservation of security because the matter has reached a very serious stage.

I had previously no personal knowledge of this matter but after receiving your letter I dis cussed the matter with the Shaikhs. lhey inform me that the people who recently left Qattar were some of the Naim tribe relations of those who previously went from Qattar to Saudi Arabia. They went from'Qattar to Saudi Arabia. None of them have or have had any connection with the people of Hawar nor did they go to Hawar or use the boats which work between Hawar and Bahrain Shaikh Abdulla 1 s statement that Hawar is used as a base against Qattar is without foundation and the Arabs who go there collecting stone and juss do not cross to the Qattar coast.

Reference your teiegrum Ho. 487 dated the 2nd July 1940. 2. I feel that I should pursue the matter for the following reason. In the second paragraph of your telegram Ho. *366 dat^ the Vtii June U40 there is reierence to niy iallure to report action taken by the Bahrain Government, while in the last paragraph doubt is thrown on the Justice oi the decision in the Hawar case which WqS based on a Tactual report submitted by me* Since in both cases — as indeed also in my assumption tnat the erection of a national mark constitutes a valid metnod of claiming sovereignty in unoccupied areas — the advantage goes to Banrain, I fear that the inference might be drawn tnat there was some &lt;piestion of my entire impartiali ty* (With regard to the Hawar case I do not of course attempt to claim that I am incapable oi missing a possible line of enquiry)• 3/- S 6 &lt; 1^40*O. I can only repeat that Sir Trencharcl Fovrle was I ally aware of the fact that Bahrain had. erected their national marks on all islands or islets to which they laid claim in the winter of 1^37-38. It is true that my Express letter Bo# C/679 of the 5th November 1938 was written in the course of correspondence x*egarding a dispute between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, but the first sentence of paragraph S thereof does not restrict the reference to erection of national marks by the Bahrain Government to islands lying between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. The reference in the same sentence to the original proposal to divide the Unallotted Area between the two Oil Companies (i.e. Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited) serves further to indicate that the erection of national marks had been made on all sides of the Island and not merely on the west. 4. It occurs to me that the reference in paragraph 4 of my Express letter No. C/S36 dated the 86th March 1940 to 'several small islets in these waters outside the three mile limit from the Qatar shore' may have led you to believe that I was referring to islands or islets contiguous to the three mile limit from Qatar. This is not the case, and the reference to the three mile limit was only inserted to dis tinguish these islets from those of the Hairar Group of which many are within three miles of r the main Qatar coast.

For the rest the opinion now given appears to be founded mainly on two considerations (i) that the rights of Qatar to the Hawar Islands find endorsement in Lorimer and (ii) that the general view of independent Arabs, presumably (though it is not so stated) proceeding mainly from the theory of geographical propinquity, with the consequent power to exercise the attributes of sovereignty, is in favour of Qatar. ■ ^ -© &gt; On the first point the only reference traceable to Hawar in Lorimer is on page 1513 of Volume II of his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf* Here Hawar is mentioned only as one of the Islands adjoining the Western Qatar coast, and there is no reference to sovereignty or proprietary rights except in so far as such can be deduced from the fact that, as is known already, the Dawasir tribe built cisterns and have houses at two places on the main island. By those who know the Arabs of the Persian Gulf the second point may possibly he held to override all logic, and Prior's opinion on such a point is entitled to great weight. But here also the Government of India cannot hut think that, even in dealing with Arabs, it would be unwise to arrive at a decision on sovereignty or proprietary rights without full consideration of matters of use, occupancy and exercise of the attributes of sovereignty. On that point the weight of the evidence so far adduced would appear to be in favour of Bahrain* 4. The Government of India are doubtful of the wisdom of calling in Daly as arbitrator in this matter. It is more than a decade since he left the Gulf and a casual opinion from him would hardly be of much value. If it were decided that the matter is sufficiently important to justify a review of the decision, and to this end to appoint an arbi trator ad hoc acceptable to both parties, and Daly could be spared for the work, the case might be different. But apart fromv: - 2 - from questions of ^irst principle the moment is inopportune for an attempt to readjudicate, and the Government of India must advise that the decision should stand* I am sending a copy of this letter to Hay, and all to Prior at Cairo. j cu.
