Arabia: The Nejd-Hejaz Feud. (Note by Political Department, India Office.) 1. The controversy between King Hueain and Bin Sand, Emir of ^eid wliicli lias formed the subject of numerous papers laid before the Eastern Oommittee, has now readied a critical stage. The immediate bone of contention between them is the village of Khnrma, to which both parties lav claim The village is actually^ in the hands of the 'Ikhwan,' Bin Sand's Wahabi followers, whom the local Hejaz forces have made various unsuccessful attempts to dislodge. As has often been explained, the enmity between the two chieftains is deep-seated ; it lenects many years of rivalry between Mecca and Riadh, aggravated by personal jealousy and by the sectarian feud between Sunni and Wahabi. Political relations with Bin Sand have hitherto fallen within the sphere of Mesopotamia and the Government of India, while those with King Husain have been conducted from Cairo. It is unfortunate that the controversy between the two Chiefs has been to some extent reflected in the views of the two administrations with which they have, respectively, been brought into contact. At the present moment Bin Sand's claims are championed by Colonel Wilson and Mr. Philby, while those of King Husain have the support Oi Sir It. \\ ingate and Colonel Laurence. It was decided in September last to change the local atmosphere by sending an officer -from the Egyptian side to Bin Sand ; but the decision has not Vet been carried out. 2. As regards the rights and wrongs of the Khurma dispute, the following summary of a statement made by Sherif Feisal, King Husain's son, during a recent visit to the India Office (27th December 1918), gives the Hejaz side of the case The Sherif discussed the relations between Bin Sand, Emir of Nejd, and the Hejaz authorities. He explained the nature of the Wahabi movement, of which Bin Saud is the figure-head and the leading spirit. From the point of view of doctrine, he has no objection whatever to Wahabism. But it is essentially a militant creed, and is being made to serve political ends. The Wahabis are intolerant of anybody and everything outside their own sect. If, for example, they gained possession of the Holy Places, they would exclude all non-Wahabis from the pilgrimage. So long as Wahabism was confined to Nejd, no one in the Hejaz had any desire to interfere with it. But they cannot tolerate its appearance in the settled area west of the desert. That is the significance of the Khurma incident. Khurma is the first settled village west of the desert, and so long as it remains under the influence of Bin Sand, it forms an outpost of Wahabism in the settled area. Sherif Feisal is determined to expel the ' Ikhwan ' (i.e., the militant Wahabis) from the village. He proposes to do so in the immediate future by force of arms. He will direct the campaign in person, and anticipates no difficulty in achieving his object. The matter is a small one, and need not occasion His Majesty's Government any pre-occupation. He will be quite satisfied with driving the Wahabis back into the desert, and has no intention of carrying the campaign into Bin Sand's own country. There is one alternative, viz., that the Hejaz people should themselves embrace Wahabism. Feisal is quite prepared to take this course, if the British Government wish; but it would mean closing down the pilgrimage to all non-Wahabis for the future. 3. For Bin Sand's claims to the village the following extract may be quoted from a report written by Mr. Philby in August 1918 1 :— 'I venture to think that His Majesty's Government will revise opinion based on distance of Khurma from Taif. As already pointed out, Khurma is only 10 miles east of unquestionable boundary of Buqum and Subai tribes, namely, Shaib Shaba. Question at issue, therefore, is jurisdiction over western section of Subai tribe, whose capital is Khurma, and whose boundary is Wadi Nairn, 120 miles east of Khurma. Adjudication of Khurma' to Sherif, therefore, necessarily implies extending boundary of 1 For a more detailed statement of the claim, please see Appendix I. 10 S 16 40 1/19 AHe , z t0 a Hue about 200 uules Son of Ataiba highlands extend ng the , )(lim daTV of Nejd Nairn; and as Sheril j el , rnfi st1y represent H ) that falls back very nearlj 1o t su pp OS ed, and has two sides ; - tliat matter is far more conip htat^ t^n 11 without raising widespread Bin Sand cannot abandon Khuuna ^ that Kbnrn)a neve! aistnrbance of ^ejd m 1^, • ^ u ^ in Baglldad telegram No. ,418, snbmit to Sherifian attacks ,1' dated 7th September Ulc.J , t - i o miv Le briefly summarised.

Wingate and was accordingly dropped. Instructions to forward the message from the Mesopotamian side were telegraphed to the Uvil Commissioner, Baghdad, on the 24th December 1 he latter replied on the 2 ah December, proposing to send the message by the. hand ol Captain Bra\, I oliticat A cent at Bahrein, but asking to be furnished, as material for the propose!! ultimatum, with u somewhat more recent and, if possible, more reliable information than ex parte ' allegations by King Husain, the veracity of whose previous reports as to Bin Sand 41 is not such as to inspire confidence.' It is not known whether Sir R. Wingate has taken any steps to supply the further particulars desired. The Egyptian authorities are inclined to regard the proposed message (which merely requires the withdrawal of Ikhwan west of Khurma) as not going far enough ; and Colonel Wilson (of Jeddah) has expressed the view, which is shared by King Husain. that a ' conflagration ' is unavoidable ' unless Ikhwan are withdrawn from Khurma and Bin Saud's occupation of that place through his Ikhwan ended ' (Cairo telegram .No. 1927, 23rd December). Mr. Philby, on tho other hand, has urged that His Majesty's Government should intervene to prohibit Sherif from further aggression,' 1 or should definitely recognise Bin Sand's 'suzerainty over Khurma (Baghdad telegram No. 10483, 29th November). 6. On one point both Colonel Wilson and Mr. Philby are agreed, viz., that, failing intervention by His Majesty's Government, an armed conflict is inevitable. The question arises, if this view is accepted, whether w T e are bound to intervene, orwhether eveiits can be left to take their own course. Prima facie we are not concerned with-the internal lends of Central Arabia, or with the'sectarian contro versies of Is J am. I he fact that both disputants are in close relations with ourselves is not necessarily a decisive factor, for we are under no obligation to either oarty to mamtain his interests against Arab rivals. It is true that we could not tolerate a VVahabi occupation of Mecca, which not only would be fatal to our prestige throuo-hout the East, but woukHead to endless difficultiee over the pilgrimage question. But the War Office are already considering the question of rendering assistance to King Husam for the defence of his capital. Their proposals include, not only the despatch of Mnhammadan troops, which seems clearly undesirable and is under stood to have been dropped, but the more practicable suggestion of supplying arms and wai inateiiel. Moreover, so tar as Alecca and the Hejaz generally aie conceiced, the case is sulhciently covered by the terms of the ultimatum which llis Majest} s C'roveinment have already approved. Phe real question seems to be whether the time has come to insist on a settlement that will definitely assign Khurma to one party or the other, or whether v e should leave the disputants to light it out among themselves, putting our trust in (Ij our warning to Bin Saud against aggressive action west of Khurma, and [2) Feisal's undertaking to content himself with expelling the Ikhwan from the Klnirma region, as guarantees for the localisation of the struggle. Against an immediate settlement it may be argued that the advice of our local officers is so conflicting as to make it impossible for His Majesty's Government to form an equitable judgment on the merits of the case. Sir R. Wingate warns us that King Husain would probably abdicate sooner than accept even provisionally the assignment of Khurma to Bin Saud; and Feisal has made it quite plain to us that he will not tolerate Wahabi occupation of the district. On the other hand, if Mr. Philby's reports are accurate, the inhabitants of Khurma have adopted Wahabi tenets and espoused Bin Sand's cause of their own free will; and their forcible reconversion or expulsion would be unpleasantly suggestive of religious persecution. The objections to letting matters drift are obvious. Our policy is to promote peace and goodwill, and not active hostilities, between our Arab friends. The spectacle of civil war between our two leading proteges will not redound to our credit or strengthen our claims to a ' mandate' from the Peace Conference, for the supervision of Arabian affairs. There is always the risk that the guarantees mentioned above will prove insufficient to localise the struggle, and that either the Hejaz party ma5 r advance into regions of which we are pledged by treaty to recognise Bin Saud as 'independent ruler' (Colonel Laurence, I understand, regards this as very improbable, and indeed as impracticable), or that Bin Saud, if successful at Khurma, may push his offensive into the Hejaz, where, for reasons indicated above, his presence would he intolerable. It has to be borne in mind that active military intervention in the Hejaz or Central Arabia is not a practicable proposition ; for practical purposes, our means of exerting pressure, if diplomatic methods fail, is by withholding our subsidy from the recalcitrant party and furnishing his rival with assistance in the form of supplies, munitions of war, and so forth. 7. The question is one that calls for an early decision by His Majesty's Govern ment. On the whole the Department is disposed to recommend— (J) that the ultimatum already approved (see paragraph 5) should be conveyed to Bin Saud by,the hand of Captain Bray 1 without more ado ; (2) that the evacuation of Khurma itself by Bin Saud's followers should not be insisted upon; (3) that King Husain should not be aaked to accept a provisional frontier (as suggested in Cairo telegram No. 1958, 2/th December^ definitely assigning Khurma to Bin Saud s sphere j it would seem sufficient to communicate t-o him the substance of the ultimatum to Bin Saud and to point out to him that the elimination of the Ikhwan from all regions west of Khurma will secure the Hejaz completely against lurther aggressive action. He might be assured that we have no intention of prejudging the question of the status of the district, and merely ask him to'exercise patience a little longer until the times are more propitious for a final- settlement. i Captain N. N. E. Bray, M.C., is an officer of the Indian Army, but he was formerly on special duty in the Hejaz and is known to the authorities in Egypt. S 16 A 2APPENDIX L Bin Saud's Claim to Khurma. [Extract from Memorandum hij Mr. Philbtj, dated 13th August 1918.) Ibii Sand most iiiidoubtedly claims Khurma as being within liis jurisdiction—he does so not on y on relig.ous and territorial grounds but also on historical, admini- stiative and tnha! grounds. He therefore considers tiie Sheriff's action as aggressive and hostile to h.mself As I have said before, this is the chief disputed point between the two parties, and Ibn Sand has again and again asserted his willingness that the iJntish Crovernment should adjudicate on the dispute on its merits 'it may be as well to be a little more precise regarding the grounds of Ibn Saud's claim. {a) miglous —The whole pojmlation of Khurma, Ashraf and Subai, Bada and JJadlir are ot tlie VVahhabi persuasion, and, moreover, have joined the inner brother- hood of that sect, namely the Akhwan. As such they regard all non -Wahhabis aa Mnshnkm (heretics; and Kaffar (infidels), and look np to Ibn Sand as their Imam and temporal ruler. As far as I can ascertain they have been Wahhabis (or Hanbalis) liom all time they ha^e become Akhwan largely in self defence against the Sheriff's aggression dating from some years back, and particularly since the Sheriff tried last year to impose a Qadhi on them with a view to breaking up their Wahhabi tendencies. As Wahhabis and Akhwan they have a religions claim on the protection of the people of Najdand Ibn Sand. . W Territorial.—High Commissioner points out that Khurma is only 80 miles in a direct line from To if. That may be true, but scarcely proves that Khurma is in the Iledjaz. 1 belie\o I am the only European who has ever seen Khurma and the country round it; 1 speak, therefore, with a full sense of my responsibility, and my considered view is that the boundary of the Iledjaz, in the widest sense in which that term is capable of being used, runs (in the tract under consideration) along the eastern edge of the Shaib Shaba south-westward to Tnraba. Ihis is undoubtedly the recognised boundary between the Buqnm and Subai tribes, and a reference to my route chart will show that it comes np to within 10 miles of Khurma. This is my opinion, while Ibn Sand and others with whom 1 have had opportunities of discussing the matter carry the boundary back 50 miles westward to the Wadi Aqiq. I believe this latter boundary can be established by Turkish documentary evidence, as the line of the Aqiq was agreed upon in the seventies between the Turkish authorities and Ibn Rashid as being the natural boundary between the Hedjaz and Najd. However, I should feel inclined to disregard this evidence as the Buqum and Shalassa are, to my view, undoubtedly Hedjaz tribes. In my opinion, therefore, the Shaib Shaba is the only possible natural boundary, and, if this view is accepted, Khurma (though only 10 miles from the Hedjaz boundary) lies in Najd. (c) Tribal. —The Khurma tract is peopled wholly by the Subai tribe, which is essentially a tribe of Najd, and extends through its whole breadth from the Summan to Wadi Subai. In view of this Ibn Sand claims jurisdiction over the Subai of Khurma, but is prepared to renounce his claim if the Subai themselves express a preference for Sheriffian rule; he is not, however, prepared to abandon them to the tender mercies of the Sheriff so long as they claim his protection and acknowledge his rule. {d) Historical and Administrative. —These grounds may be considered together. High Commissioner is informed that Khalid was nominated Amir of Khurma four years ago by the Sheriff. This is improbable on the face of it, as Khalid, according to my information, succeeded his cousin Ghalib on the latter's death in the ordinary course of inheritance, and, like other Amirs of Najd, has regularly made his annual visit to Riyadh to receive his subsidy and presents ever since as his predecessor did before him. In any case if any formal appointment by the Sheriff took place, and was acknowledged by Khalid himself, he ought .to be in a position to produce documentary evidence. What he in all probability means (turning the circumstance to suit his own present requirements) is that when Ghalib died his successor, Khalid, was formally recorded in the Turkish registers as the rightful recipient of the Haj Surra paid by the Turkish Government to all tribes in a position to annoy the annual pilgrim caravans. That is a very different matter, and proves nothing, as the pages -6 of Doughty are sufficient to show Jat Sun^was o„ the other 1. 1 d « snVr^ s effective j urls,1 ' ctl0 ° 0 V ! t „n li^ from' taxation, which the peop e of Saud claims that the 0 '|' jjj j'. was conferred upon them by Saud the I'list Kimrina have enjoyed, and stil J .

I trust, will be sufficient to show that at any rale there is a cood ca-e for im-stigation and that no «x par opinion can dispose of it satisfactonb • The two reverses to his aims which I have reported have doubtless proved iiijuuoas to the Sheriff's prestige, but he has no one to blame for that but himsell. I note that tL High Commissioner considers that the Sheriff regards Khurma as his ternlory ' apparently with reason,' and that he does not doubt the smcenty of nis assniances that Shakir will not advance cast of Khurma to attack Ibn Sand s subj. Us. U &gt; iemarks are intended to indicate 'that no action is being or has been taken 1o prevent the development of the Sheriff's operations and that His Majesty s Govern- ment approve of thus letting events run their course, I can only say L regard the situation with the most lively apprehension. Until the worst comes to the worst however, I cannot believe that His Majesty s Government, after then nnpaitia warning to both rulers to refrain from provocative action, will allow one of the • • .t .k +v.r.+ +n rlisT'f* otitc I it in t,he verv matter in respect of which, it Finally, a word as to the ' activities of Akhwan agents who are evidently at the root of the trouble.' To the best of my belief the somewhat vague and often' reiterated accusation that Akhwan agents have of late been busy undermining the influence of the Sheriff has never been substantiated. In any case it is scarcely applicable to the case of Khurma, whose inhabitants, lock, stock, and barrel, have always been Wahhabis and are all Akhwan and as such require no proselytising. The abortive mission of the Sherifhan Qadhi on the other hand is clear enough evidence that it is the Sheriff who is guilty of interfering with the religious liberty of the people of Khurma. This is no mere vague accusation based on Wahhabi reports, but is fully borne out by the evidence of the letters of the King's son, Abdulla, of which I have already forwarded translations. Incidentally I may mention that present Wahhabi priest of Khurma and his father before him have occupied the post without a break for 60 years, the father having been appointed by Faisal. APPENDIX II. The alleged Treaty between Bin Saud and the Sherif. The War Office have recently raised the question, at the instance of Colonel Laiirence, of the existence of a treaty between Bin Saud and Kin'- Hnsain assigning the Khurma region to the latter. The position appears to be that in the ViV 3 tlle • , lf ' tak . ing advanta g e of a revolt in Southern Keid, sent his Abdullah to invade Qasim. .The invasion was not completely successful but Bin Saud was forced to accept the Sherif's terms, which included the stipulation th-it thp great tnlies lying between *ejd and the Hejaz should be outside Bin Saudl sphere In .) Abdullah again led an expedition to enforce the terms of the 1910 treatv K.if peace was patched up and Abdullah retired. } ' but</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002ed_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B308</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002ed</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B308</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Arabia: The Nejd-Hejaz Feud'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1919/1919</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-19T09:09:48</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (3 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation for sequence for this file commences at folio 11, and terminates at folio 13, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
