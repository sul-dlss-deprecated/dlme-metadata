As your office has, from time to time, been kept informed of the progress of our enquiry, it will be sufficient to state here, on that head, that the Commission met in Bombay on the 1st November 1873, and on the same, day intimated to the Resident—with reference to the instructions contained in paragraph 9 of your office despatch already alluded to, that it was only to deal with such complaints as were laid before it, by or through him—the course it proposed to take in car rying out the duty delegated to it by the Government of India; that it commenced its sittings at Baroda on the 10th idem, and continued them daily, Sundays excepted, till the 24th December, when, the Resident having intimated officially that he considered the cases already enquired into amply sufficient to establish the General Charges brought by him against the Gaekwar's Administration, and it appearing undesirable that the Commission should protract its stay at Baroda any longer than was absolutely necessary, we at once returned to Bombay in view to arranging and analysing the evidence that had been taken, and comple ting our Report at the Presidency. Copies of the letters to and from the Resident on the above ^ points will be found among the appendices to this letter;— 3. As the enquiry on which the Commission has been engaged originated in the allegations of maladministration of the Baroda State by the present Ruler and his chief officers and servants, laid before Government by the Resident, it will be proper in the first place to give a brief account of the principal events connected with His Highness Malharrao, and bis career hitherto, and the names and characters of the officials who are popularly regarded as his chief advisers. I. His Highness Malharrao is the fifth and last surviving son of Maharaja Seiajirao, and is about 43 years of age. Of his four elder brothers, two, viz., Ganpatrao and Khanderao, successively filled the post of Ruler after their father's death, the last-named having reigned from 19th November 1856 to 28th November 1870. In 1863, His High- 1 B C 1nessMalharrao was accused of being concerned in a conspiracy to compass the rlpflth of his brother Khanderao by poison or other means, and was in consequence confined as a Stete prisoner at Padra in the Baroda territory during the remam- der of that prince's life ; his associates in the plot, who were in his service, being sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. On the death of his Highness Khanderao on 28th November 1870, which -occurred rather suddenly, Malharrao was at once summoned from Padra, and installed as his successor by the Resident, with an intimation, however, that his recognition as reigning Gaekwar must be dependent on the sanction 01 the British Government, which was accorded on 1st December 1870. ™ * niv II- His principal officers and advisers, who may be His ne ceis. ^ f orm the present Durbar, are :— 1. The Dewan, Seiajirao Khanvelkar. 2. The Senapati, Bapujirao Mohita. The Members of the First or High Court, viz.— :3. Govindrao Mama. 4. Balvantrao Dev. 5. Bapubhai Daiashankar. 6. Martandrao Anna. 7. The Revenue Commissioner, Hariba Gaekwar. , 8. The Sir Foujdar, Balvantrao Eshvant. The other officials about the Court, who are regarded as having more or less influence on the conduct of affairs, are :— 9. The Deputy Revenue Commissioner, Narayenbhai Lallubhai. 10. The Farnavis, Mahadevarao Ramchandar. 11. The Controller of the State Banks and His Highness' private treasury, Wasant Rambhao. Of these persons, the first two are His Highness' brothers-in-law. The Dewan is stated to be ignorant and inexperienced, and to be quite unfit for the respon sible duties of his office. He has also the reputation of being very avaricious and of having already amassed considerable wealth by taking improper advantage of his position. The Senapati is favourably spoken of, but has probably little real influence. Of the Members of the High Court— Govindrao Mama is not favourably spoken of. Balvantrao Dev was formerly dismissed from the post of Karbhari of Luna- wada for taking bribes, and bears an indifferent character in his present office. He is stated to have been fined and dismissed the service by the late Ruler for corrupt practices. Bapubhai Daiashankar bears a good reputation, and is a respectable man. Martandrao Anna is not well spoken of, but has little weight. The Revenue Commissioner is regarded as a harsh authority in matters relating to his department, and is stated to have been accused of oppression and bribery.' ■ 1 . r ^ e Foujdar appears to have been mixed up in several of the oppressive an irregular proceedings that have been the subject of complaint before the omrmssion, and is said to have been sentenced to imprisonment by the late ChiefThe Deputy Revenue Commissioner was formerly dismissed the service of the British Government, in connection with charges of misconduct and taking bribes. The popular opinion of this man is stated to be most unfavourable. There appears to be nothing to remark regarding the Farnavis, but the Controller of the State Banks and Privy Purse is said to be regarded as an unscru pulous Agent of the Maharaja's, and his name has been unfavourably mentioned in connection with some of the cases that have come before the Commission. The opinions regarding the above-mentioned persons recorded in these re marks have been gathered partly from the Resident, and partly from independent enquiries by ourselves. 4. Turning now to the subject proper of the Report, viz., the results of our enquiries into the matters which have been under investigation at our hands, we propose to divide the same into two parts as follows :— Parti —to embrace (1), the alleged unjust and oppressive treatment of British subjects, and the course recommended for adoption by the Commission in connection therewith, (as described in para. 5 of your Office Despatch No. 2209-p), and (2), the allegation of general misgovermnent of the Baroda State, with the grievances connected therewith, or arisiug therefrom, that have been the subject of investigation, and the opinion of the Commission as to the establishment, or otherwise, of the existence of such general misgovernment being held as proved, with the measures suggested by the Commission to bring about and maintain for the future a more satisfactory state of affairs, without entailing a minute and vexatious interference on the part of the British Government, (as directed in para. 8 of your Office Despatch No. 2209-p,) Part II —to embrace (1), the results of the enquiries instituted by the Com mission into the present condition of the Contingent, and its fitness, or otherwise, for the satisfactory performance of the duties on which it is employed in the Tri butary Mahals; and (2), the measures and rules proposed for adoption by the Commission, to render the Force duly efficient for the purposes of such duties, &lt;(as enjoined in para. 14 of the Despatch already referred to). Part 5. The Schedules furnished to the Commission by the Resident, drawn up in accordance with the instructions communicated to him in our letter dated 1st November 1873, are three in number, and contain the following cases or groups of cases of grievance :— Schedule I. —Complaints of British subjects. Thirteen cases or groups of cases. Schedule II. —Complaints of Baroda subjects of general misgovernment. Sixty-six cases or groups of cases. Schedule III. —Miscellaneous and similar complaints to these in Schedule II. Fourteen cases or .groups of cases. The evidence iu extenso taken in all the cases brought forward in the above Schedules that have been investigated, will be found properly classed and ar ranged in the Minutes of the Commission, together with the cross-examinations, replies, or remarks by the Durbar Agent in each case, and the final rejoinders of the Resident to the latter. A summary of the proceedings in each such case, similarly arranged, with the opinion of the Commission on its merits, is attached as a separate Appendix to this Report. 6. Schedule 1. —Complaints of unjust and oppressive treatment of British subjects. .-t j ji In this Schedule, as originally framed by the .Resident thirteen cases were brought forward for' investigation, but the Commission considered that only seven of the number properly appertained to this Schedule, as demanding enquiry under the terms of para. 5 of the Despatch of 19th September 1873, and the transfer of the remaining six cases to Schedule III. was accordingly ordered. The Commission investigated the grievances of five of the seven complain ants whose cases were, thus retained in this Schedule, but was unable to do so in the case of the remaining two, as the complaints did not attend. The opinion of the Commission on each of the cases investigated by it is recorded in the Summary appended to this Report, and it will be seen that in only one. No. 10, does it consider that the complaint has been substantiated in a man ner to require special redress from the Durbar; and further, that on the occur rence which forms the subject of grievance in that case being brought to i{'s notice, the Durbar took proper action against the offending official, and awarded adequate punishment. The amount of compensation that should be paid to the complainant in this case, has been fixed by the Commission at Rs. 100. Finally, the circumstances that have been brought before us, in connection with this branch of the enquiry, do not, in our opinion, warrant our proposing any general measures for the special protection of British subjects within the Baroda territories. With regard to the Resident's remarks under Cases 11 of Schedule I. and 33 of Schedule II, on the subject of the alleged irregular surrender of accused parties to the Durbar by the British authorities, and even their seizure by Durbar officials in British territory, the correction of the former practice, if it really exists, does not rest with this Commission, while the British magistrates are fully competent to deal effectually with every case of the latter that is brought to their notice. This has been pointed out to the Resident, and he has been informed that the Commission cannot enquire into and deal with such cases. 7. Schedules II. and ///.—Complaints and allegations in support of the charge of general misgovernment. The Commission has enquired into fifty-seven cases or groups of cases brought forward in Schedule 11., and eight of those entered in Schedule III. Nine cases in the former, and six in the latter Schedule, have not been investigated or entered into, for reasons which will be found recorded under each such case in the list of uninvestigated cases appendeii to the Summary. . ^■ The sixty-five complaints in both Schedules, that have been enquired into, have been grouped or classed in twenty-one cases in the Summary, and the opinion of the Commission on each group or individual case will be found recorded therein, as briefly shown in the following Statement :— Number of Group or Case in Summary. No. 1 Nature of grievance and number of complainants examined by Commission. Grievances of the Sardars, and Military classes of the Baroda State. Forty complainants examined. Opinion of the Commission. The uncertainty of service, and liability to summary dismissal without special cause or reason, to which these classes appear to have been subject at the hands of previous Gaekwars, have been seriously aggravated since the accession of the present Chief, by the wholesale reductions he has carried out amongst them within a comparatively brief period,—gefterally in an arbitrary manner, and as regards the followers and depen dents of his predecessor—rather apparently in a spirit of hate and vengeance, than from a feeling of State necessity.Number of Group or Case in Sumuiary No. 2 No. 3 No. 4 No. 5 Nature of grievance, and nurribet of complainants examined by Commission.

Complaints of Baroda subjects of personal ill-treatment, des cribed as amounting to tor ture, at the hands of the Gaekwar's officials. Four(4)complainants examined. The levy of a Accession Naza;^ana/ , with the measures taken to enforce its payment, is the only item of complainants' grievances for which the present Chief appears to be directly responsible; and, though the tax is, in the Commissions opinion, an objec tionable one, it would appear, if the Durbar statement is correct, that it was imposed with the concurrence, as' it certainly Must have been with the knowledge, of the then Resident. ,]The present Chief is responsible for the addi tion of the ' Accession Nazarana' to the previously heavy burdens borne tby the people, and for the increased difficulties experienced in consequence in realising the Government demands. The exaction of ' Nazarana' from the Vahivatdars on ap pointment and the alleged attempts of the latter class to recoup themselves from the ryots, which have been brought tQ notice by some of the complainants in this group of cases, would also appear, even if in existence previouslv, to have acquired a more serious and injurious character since the accession of the present Chief. It is also important to notice, in connection with thi^ group of grievanqes, that representations of the ill- treatment inflicted on them, are alleged by some of the complainants, to have been made by them and their fello \yr ^ufferers to the Chief himself, the Minister and the Revenue Commissioner, but without their obtaiping any redress; while in some in stances, the complainants depose that they were further ill-treated in consequence. Others of the complainants state that they made no such representations, because their doing so would have been useless: * There seems to be no reason for doubt that the levy of' Nazarana' on appointment, from this and other classes of officials, is customary, and further, that tlm collection of the revenue of their Mahals has, in some instances at least, been farmed out to the Vahivatdars. The number of such instances brought before the Commission has not been large, but there can be no doubt that such cases do occur, and that there is good ground for the opinion that the character of the class of men, generally, employed as Vahivatdars, and the circumstances connected with these 2 b c6 Number of Group or Case in Summary.

Complaint of unjust imprison- In the proceedings taken against, and the ment by the Baroda Durbar, sentence passed on Fakir Shaha Sahib, for One (1) complainant examined, writing defamatory articles regarding the Maharaja, the Commission considers that there is no ground for questioning the right of the Durbar to institute proceedings against and to punish him ; but the sentence passed was altogether excessive, and out of all proportion to the offence. The action of the late and present Gaekwars, towards individuals of this class, appears to have been highly arbitrary, and the proceedings of the present administration, especially in some of the cases brought before the Commission, seems to it to warrant the conclusion that wealthy indivi duals or firms at Baroda, who are not in favour with the Maharaja or his principal officials, have grave grounds for alarm and anxiety as to the security and freedom from molestation, of themselves and their pro perty. The Commission, in the face of the proceed ings in the trial of the accused persons, laid before it by the Durbar, can only observe that the punishment appears to have been inflicted without any precaution to prevent its proving excessive, as one of the sufferers died while undergoing it. With regard to the further enquiries made by the Resident in this case, subsequent to the departure of the Commission from Baroda, it does not appear to be necessary to offer any remarks thereon here.

The grievance complained of is one of long standing; but it is hoped that it will now be redressed. It is not, however, one in which the Commission can interfere. The grievances of the complain- nants, who were very nume rous, were heard orally by the Commission. Claims of the creditors of the late Bhao Sindia, Dewan of the late Gaekwar.

A reform of the present jail system and arrangements is no doubt re quired. There is no doubt that the present Chief has attached and confiscated all the de ceased's property in Baroda, on the ground of the public claims against the late Minis ter for malversation of the State property and revenues; but the Commission is not in a position to judge of the merits of this proceeding, or to form an opinion of the value of the property so seized. f The Maharaja appears to the Commission to be bound to adopt the steps that are neces sary to effect an equitable settlement of these large personal claims against His Highness without delay. The Commission has sug gested the mode that appears to it to be the most fitting, under the circumstances, for adoption with this object.Number of Group or Case in Sum mary.

In the attachment by the Durbar of the Inamt village, granted to the then Minister by the late Chief, for his services at the period of the Mutiny, the present Gaekwar is respon sible for the continuance of an act of, appar ently, unjust repudiation of his own grant by his predecessor, and for the determi nation to enforce the same by the final resumption of the village in question, giving complainant one of inferior value or a money payment in lieu of it. The Durbar has intimated to the Commis sion its readiness to adjust the account, on the attendance of complainant with his vouchers for the purpose. The claim is not one that the Commission can with propriety take up or dispose of. The Commission has held no investigation in to, and is therefore not in a position to offer any but general remarks on the subjects' noticed in these representations, which will be found recorded in the Summary. 9. On a full consideration of the circumstances that have come to notice . in the course of the enquiry held by the Com- duction TsiXrandSiSIrs re ' mission, as summarised in the foregoing paras, of 2.

The Commission further considers— (1) That the^ grievances of the Agricultural classes require careful exa mination and consideration at the hands of the Durbar, in view to the mitiga tion or removal of several of the grounds of complaint, stated by the persons of these classes who attended the Commission, which appear to be well founded, and, though not due, or but partly due, to the present Chief, undoubtedly call for redness. These grievances included the present high rates of land assessment which demand revision, and the levy of general 'Nazaranas' under whatever name, or on whatever ground, by the Chief or the Minister. (2) That the existing practice of levying ' Nazarana,' on appointment, from Yahiyatdars and other officials, whether in the name of the Chief himself or by the Minister or his deputies, and of giving the Mahals, over which they e1 preside, in farm, on whatever plea, to the former class, is wholly inconsistent with good Government, and should be entirely relinquished and interdicted. (3) That the practice of ill-treating accused persons or prisoners, with the object of extorting confession—which certainly obtains to some extent—demands the most watchful and sincere efforts of the Durbar for its absolute suppression. (4) That the settlement of the rights of all Vatandars throughout the State, which was promised by the late Chief 8 or 9 years ago, when the Vatans generally were attached, should be carried out in a just and equitable manner without delay, or all action in the matter finally dropped, the Vatandars being restored to, or not being disturbed in, the enjoyment of their, generally, long- enjoyed rights. (5) That the adoption of a humane and otherwise suitable code of rules for the administration of the State Jails is very desirable; and— (6) That the Judicial Department and Administration require entire reform, the existing abuses being abolished, so as to remove the present uncertain and irregular application of the law, and want of confidence in the proceedings of the Courts and Magistrates, which have been strongly urged on our attention by the Resident in the course of this enquiry, and of the existence of which we can have no reasonable doubt. 11. Lastly, we are compelled to come to the conclusion that the state of affairs thus pourtrayed does, when viewed altogether, constitute general mal administration of a character urgently calling for reformation,—especially with reference to the intermixed position of the Baroda and British Districts, and the consequent intimate relations and interests existing between them,—and that such a change of system, as is needed with this object, cannot, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, be effected without some interference on the part of the British Government. 12. As regards the present Gaekwar himself, we have already (in para. 3 of this report) given a brief sketch of his career, from which it may be judged that his antecedents, at the time of his accession, can hardly be said to have furnished grounds for the expectation that he would prove a wise and good ruler. His harsh and severe treatment of his predecessor's relatives and dependents forms perhaps the greatest blot on his character since his assumption of the Chief- ship, but some excuse for this may be found in the fact that he considered that he and his friends and associates had been harshly and unjustly treated by the late Chief and his servants and favourites, and that retaliatory measures towards the latter, when within his power, were justifiable. Thus Bhao Sindia, who was at once deposed from the office of Minister and thrown into prison—where he ended his life after 18 months' confinement, under circumstances of grave suspicion— was the Chief Judicial Officer of the State who conducted the enquiry into the charge of conspiring against the then Chief, which resulted in Malharrao's impri sonment during seven years and the severe punishment of several of his friends and dependents ; and no doubt many of the late Gaekwar's other servants and favourites, who have suffered at his successor's hands, took an active part in the proceedings against His Highness Malharrao at that period, and were regarded by him as his personal enemies. Still, making every allowance for the feelings that would naturally actuate a person of His Highness Malharrao's disposition under such circumstances, it is impossible to avoid the conviction, from the vin dictive nature of his proceedings towards so large a number of persons as in this instance, and his violent and spoliatory treatment Note. —The reductions amongst of many of them, as also his measures towards cer- the Sirdar and Siliedar classes tain Bankers and Inamdars, and the general cha- ' KuXwf ta a« ^? r ^ other important respects ot his adminis- admitted by the Durbar to have ag- tration during the last three years, that he is not a gregated, within the last 3 years, prince who can be reasonably expected to introduce, Rs. 1,93,500 of annual charge. 0 f himself, the change of system absolutely neces sary to reform existing abuses, and to place the ad- 3 b c 9nlinistration on a footing to entitle it to the confidence and support of the British Government, and the loyal and willing- obedience of all its subjects. 13 Nor however well-disposed His Highness might himself be to concur in the adoption of the measures necessary to this object, could they, in our opinion, be attempted with any prospect of success with the aid of his present Minister and principal Officials, most of whom, so far as we can judge, are by no means of the class of men that should fill such responsible and important posts. 14. Tb obtain such a result, we deem it to be essential that the Minister of the Baroda State shall be selected with reference to his administrative experience, and personal and other special qualifications for the post, and—while enjoined to secure the Chief's good-will and confidence, and to work in respectful subordina tion to him, never forgetting their relative [positions,—that he shall have such support from the Resident, as may be necessary to enable him to carry out, efficiently and satisfactorily, the important functions of his office, and that he ,cili all not be liable to removal without the special orders of the British Government. We are further of opinion that the Resident should, for a time at least, be vestrd with special authority to intervene, if necessary, between the Maharaja and the Minister. 15. With regard to the unsatisfactory character of many of the pie sent Durbar Officials, and the bad reputation in which they appear to the Commissic n to be held by a large proportion of the people, the first duty that would devolve on the new Minister, if appointed as above proposed, would be a careful elimina tion and dismissal of such of them as are unfit to be continued in the public service under the new arrangement, and he would probably require the assistanc e of the Resident in obtaining, under the sanction of Government, the services of an adequate number of competent and qualified men from the British provinces or elsewhere, who can be induced to take employment in the Gaekwar's service. On this point, we will only observe that, while we should deprecate any needless introduction of other than Baroda subjects into the service of the State, the employment of a few carefully selected men, who have already received an adequate training in the British public service, will, so far as we can judge, be absolutely necessary to enable the Minister to carry out the changes so urgently called for. We understand that the Maharaja is not averse to the entertain ment of any needful number of men of this class that can be obtained for the purpose. 16. In thus submitting, as directed, for the consideration of His Excellency in Council, our views as to the measures that should be adopted to bring about and maintain for the future a more satisfactory state of affairs in Baroda, without entailing a minute and vexatious interference on the part of the British Govern ment, we would beg to add that we are not unmindful of the objections that naturally suggest themselves to such an arrangement as that proposed, or to the delicate nature of the task that will devolve on the Minister and the Eesident, in making that arrangement, if carried out, work successfully. 17. But we are fully convinced that the defects of the Baroda Administra tion are of such a nature, that no lesser interference than that suggested, can,, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, be of any avail. There can be no doubt that, during the last 6 or 7 years of His Highness Khauderao's life, the system qf government, bad as it appears always to have been, underwen- a serious decadence : the proceedings of the Chief were more arbitrary than previously ; • As Oi, Of 10 per cert, on th, new* cesses and levies were imposed, without revmme of all State lands for one consideration of the previously heavy assessment year for the construction of a new to which the ryots were subject, and the collec- Palape, another of smaller amount tion of the Government dues was enforced bv the Wdar&amp;? ami acture 0f a golden local officials, by harsh and compulsory measures, , ' of the charactertliat have been deposed to by many witnesses who have appeared before the Commission ; while complaints were not heard, and there was no redress for such grievances. to11 The ftppointment of Bhao Sindia as Minister in 1867 appears to have still further aggravated the state of things previously existing, his character being, it is alleged, extremely venal and rapacious. The accession of the present Chief has merely resulted in the change of some of the officials, but without benefit to the country or the people, for there has been no change in the system, and the craving for acquiring wealth, however irregularly or improperly, has been doubtless as keen amongst the new employes, as those displaced by them; while the Maharaj himself, appears, unhappily, to have been bent On increasing his revenue by impru dent and oppressive means. 18. Under such circumstances, it appears to us to be hopeless to look for any effectual measures of reform and improved government at the hands of the pre sent Ruler and his advisers, and we are convinced that these can only be introduce ed through the intervention and under the auspices of the British Government. At the same time, we have no doubt that it will be quite in the power of the Maharaja to ensure success to the measures that may be so authorised, and to render further interference unnecessary, by accepting them frankly, and giving his cordial support to the Minister who may be appointed with the approval of the British Govern ment.

Before closing this part of the Report, it will be proper for us 'to refer to the issue by the Resident, under our authority, of a notice, intimating that persons appearing to give evidence before the Commission, would be under his protection as Resident, in respect of bond evidence so given by them; and to some other points requiring remark. The issue of the notice w T as authorised by us in consequence of the Resident's representation that, without some such assurance, it was not to be expected that complainants would venture to come forward ; but we were much concerned to find, on the receipt of the copy of your Despatch to the Government of Bombay, No. 4 c. p ., dated 15th November 187.3, (forwarded under your Office docket No. 5 c. p ., of the same date), that the course we had been led to take was op posed to the views and intentions of the Government of India, as set forth in para. 3 of that Despatch. A copy of the Notice, as amended by us, will be found in the appendix to this Report, and we will only add that, in its application to the witnesses who appeared before us, the instructions conveyed in your message on the Subject, dated 22nd November i 873, were carefully borne in mind and acted on. 2u. With regard to the hope expressed in the Kharita, dated 19th Septem ber 1873, from His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General to His Highness the Gaekwar, that he would afford to the Commission every assistance in his power during its investigations, we deem it right to state for the information of His Excellency in Council, that we had, generally, every reason to be satisfied with the arrangements made by the Durbar with the above object, so far as they came under our observation. The conduct of the principal Durbar Agent who attended the sittings of the Commission, and those appointed with him, w T as friendly and free from obstruction, and our references through him to the Durbar, where such were necessary in any of the cases that came before us, were duly and generally promptly dealt with. There were seme complaints of obstruction by the Durbar Officials to parties who desired to state their grievances to the Commission, and one of ill-treatment of certain ryots who had visited Baroda, and represented their hardships to the Resident, which were laid before the Ccmmission tco late for any enquiry by it. The Durbar Agent, however, premised that these complaints should be duly enquired into, and the result reported to the Resident. On its part, the Ccmmission was scrupulously careful to avoid any proceeding, that might have the effect of rendering the enquiry it was conducting, more distasteful and painful to His Highness, than was absolutely unavoidable under the circumstances. ,12 21 With reference to certain differences between the Resident and ourselves regarding some of the cases brought forward by him—as will be seen from our pro ceedings and his Schedules and letters in the Appendices—we beg to remark that ■we found it impossible to investigate, in the manner desired by the Resident, some of the cases entered in the Schedules, as to have done so, had there been no other objection to such a course, to the extent required to enable us to form an accuratejudgment of their exact merits, would probably have taken several days for each, especially where an examination of old and lengthy accounts was essential to a proper understanding of the facts. It was, moreover, unlikely that the evidence forthcoming would prove to be of an adequate character to establish satisfactorily the charge or claim in these cases, while, even if it should appear to be so, as the Durbar could not have been called on to defend them, and there could thus have been no contention, the result would still have been one sided and valueless. Again, in certain cases in which the Resident ^ desired the proceedings of the Durbar's Criminal Courts to be thoroughly investigated, and the original charge in each such instance to be virtually retried by the Commission, we deemed it sufficient to consider, (1), if the Durbar had reasonable ground for regarding itself as warranted in dealing with the case, and (2), when it appeared to have such ground, if there was anything of so excessive or exceptional a character in the sentence passed by it, as to require or justify our interference. When the latter was not clearly the case, we deemed it to be our duty to decline such interference, as being unnecessary and improper. Lastly, in two claims against the Maharaja personally, on account of the price of certain jewels purchased by him, which had remained unadjusted by His Highness on the plea that he had been deceived as to the value of the articles, we considered that we had no authority to investigate the same, and therefore confined our intervention to directing the attention of the Durbar Agent to the said claims, and pointing out the most fitting course that appeared to us to be open for adoption for their settlement. 22. We will only add that we are well aware that many of the cases in which we have allowed the complainants to appear before the Commission, are not of a class that would, ordinarily, be fit subjects for enquiry or official interference at the hands of the British authorities. With reference, however, to the objects of the assembly of the Commission, and the general circumstances of the allega tions against the Durbar, we have deemed the course taken by us in this class of cases to have been that which it behoved us to adopt, and trust that the same may meet with the approval of His Excellency in Council. 23. It may be proper further to explain that the Resident was anxious to notice the Durbar's replies or remarks in some of the cases deposed to before the Commission, and that, as there were obvious objections to his doing so in the way of a rejoinder at the time, we consented to allow him to submit a final memo, or note in each case in which he deemed such to be necessary. Such memos, we intended to be merely brief comments on any particular point or statement put forth by the Durbar Agent, which might appear to the Resident to call for special remark from him, but these final notes have in some instances extended to a length greatly in excess of what was contemplated by the Commission, when acceding to their submission. We have, however, thought it better, under the circumstances, to allow all of them to be included in in the Appendices to this Report./ PART II. 24. We next proceed to record (1), the results of our enquiries into the present condition of the Contingent, and its fitness for the satisfactory perform ance of the duties on which it is employed iu the Tributary Mahalsand (2), the measures and rules we propose for adoption to render the Force duly efficient for the purpose of the said duties. 25. The Chief Officer of the Contingent, who is styled Sir Subah, resides at Baroda, and the reports of the three Subahs, who exercise respectively the command of the three* chief divisions, are made to him. * Kattywar. The Sir gubah alone can order the dismissal of a MahfiCanta Silledar, or the enrolment of new men. The Nimuok attached to the office of Head of the Contingent is enjoyed by him, and all matters of importance connected with the Force are referred to him, by the Subahs, for disposal as Colonel-in-Chief, or for the orders of the Durbar. The present Sir Subah is the Minister of the State. 26. The Subahs reside at the Head Quarters of, and exercise command over the portions of the Contingent under their charge. They are responsible for the mustering of the men, the disbursement of pay, the detail of the men for duty, and generally for the state and condition of the Force under their com mand ; and it is their duty to enquire into all complaints of misconduct that are brought against any of their men by the British Officers in whose districts they are employed, and to deal adequately therewith. The Subahs have a,uthority to fine all the men under their charge, to imprison them for short periods, and to dismiss Bargirs. Serious offences beyond these powers, are referred by the Subahs to the Sir Subah for his orders, or those of the Durbar. 27. The Contingent is employed in the maintenance of order in the terrii itories included within the Political Agencies of Kattywar, Pahlanpur, Mah- Kanta, and Rewa Kanta, and a detail of the Force is attached to the Residency at Baroda. _ - j- The following table shews the general wgamzatise, and distribution of the Contingent, as ascertained from returns furnished to the Commission ;— State Risalas or Pagahs.

Kattywar Agency. —A British Officer with the designation of Superin tendent of the Contingent, exercises a general control over the portion of the Force employed in Kattywar. All requisitions or complaints in connection with 4 b c ' ^.314 it are made to by the Political Agent and his assistants, and are referred by him to the Subah in immediate command of such portion, who resides at Head Quarters at Manikwara. The Superintendent is also Assistant to the Resident at Baroda, and is in Political charge of the Gaekwar's Mahals in Kat- tywar. He is under the orders of the Political Agent as regards the distribution and employment of the Force, but reports to the Resident in any matters con nected with its control or internal economy, which cannot be arranged with or through the Subah, and in which a reference to the Durbar is necessary. The Superintendent's powers of control and representation extend to the casting of such horses as are in his opinion unserviceable, and to the approval or rejection of those entertained to replace them; to referring to the Subah for enquiry and proper notice, cases of misconduct on the part of the men, and where such ap pears to be necessary, suggesting the nature of the punishment that should be inflicted therein; and to reporting to the Resident instances of special good or bad conduct on the part of the men, or other matters connected with the Force, that he desires to bring to the notice of the Durbar. It is further the duty of the Superintendent to see that the Contingent is kept in order, and that the men are dressed, armed, and accoutred ' according to the Gaekwari custom' as provided in the Treaty; that the Reformed Troop is drilled, clothed, and armed, as ordered; and, as stated above, to receive and dispose of all requisitions for detachments and all complaints against the men from the Political Officers of the Agency. The Superintendent observes that during six years incumbency of the post he has always received the fullest and most willing assistance from the Subah and has never had to refer a case to the Resident, on account of the Subah', neglect to attend to his representations. Instances of serious offence, reported to the Durbar by the Subah with the Superintendent's opinion, are, he adds, invari ably dealt with by it with due severity. 29. As regards the composition of the Kattywar portion of the Contingent the Pagadars generally, and many of the Silledars, reside at Baroda, the duties connected with the charge of the Pagahs being performed by their deputies, while the absent Silledars are represented by Bargirs. The Pagahs are composed of individual Silledars and Bargirs, who ride horses belonging to the Pagadars. Bargirs are similarly employed by the Silledars who have more than one horse or ' asami.' Reformed Troop. Two of the Pagahs, comprising 111 men of all grades, have been organized into a ' Reformed Troop,' as noted in the margin. The pay al- lowed for the Sowars of this troop, is Babasai 4 Jemadars 2 Trumpeters ^ 2 8 -^ 0 ) P e r mensem which is 1 Worda Major l Camel Sowar [ . wn b y t . he Pagadars, the whole of the men 4 Havildars 2 Farriers being Bargirs. The latter receive Babasai Rs. 10 i xr^ 8 , , J] Non-effective s (British Rs. 8-2-0) per mensem, the horses, uni- an ar ar 4 Sowars form, arms, and equipments being all provided by the Pagadars. The whole of the rest of the Force consists of ordi- emam er o e orce. nary' Rajwara' Sowars, and is without uniform, mili tary organization, or discipline of any sort. 30. Horses. The horses of the Force generally are of small size, and many of tnem are m bad condition, which is no doubt to some extent due to the descrip tion of work on which they are employed. Much of it is, however, the natural consequence of neglect and want of supervision. Some of the horses are fairly good and a large proportion of them, though not of the class that would be deemed , .rrlll l c&amp;yslr y purposes, would probably be quite equal to the ry u ies e Contingent ought to be employed on, if more cared for by their15 riders, and less knocked about. The horses of the ' Reformed Troop' are not much superior to those of the rest of the Force, hut they are better cared for, and may be described as fairly efficient. 31. Arms and Equipments. —The ' Reformed Troop' is armed with swords and carbines; the rest of the Force with swords and generally matchlocks, the latter mostly of a very old and apparently unserviceable description. A few men have old guns and pistols, and some carry spears. 32. Pay. —The pay of the 'Reformed Troop' has already been stated. That of the rest of the Force is Babasai Rs. CO, (British Rs. 23-9-0), per mensem, for Silledar Sowars, and Babasai Rs. 8, (British Rs. 6-8-0), for Bargir Sowars. Some of the Silledars, and specially the ' Mankaris,' receive considerably more than the ordinary rate of Silledars' pay, as above. It is stated that, ordinarily, Silledars save nothing of their pay, but that when grain and grass are cheap, they can put by Rs. 2 or so per mensem. When prices are so exceptionally high as to call for such a course, special compensation is, it is alleged, allowed to the men by the Durbar, on the report of the Subah. The pay is disbursed regularly monthly, and the Superintendent states that there are no complaints of delay in its issue, or of deductions being made from it. 33. Officers. —With the exception of the ' Reformed Troop,' the ar range ments respecting officers, whether of the superior or inferior class, appear to be very defective and untrustworthy. In the case of the Pagahs, the chief officer is the Deputy of the Pagadar, and is styled a Jemadar, but he appears to exercise little authority amongst the men. It is alleged that there are also inferior officers, but they receive no special pay as such, and do not seem to have any weight, amongst their comrades. Amongst the Silledars, some men are selected according to their respectability for the subordinate posts, but receive no extra pay. Their case is apparently similar to that of the same class in the Pagahs, as stated in the preceding psCra. 34. With reference to the distribution of the Force, it should be noticed that a large proportion of the number of men (223) returned as present at Head Quarters, consists of Karkuns, who are non-effective, and old Sowars, who though capable of performing light duties connected with the Head Quarters, are not fit for active or detachment work. Of the (662) men entered as on duty— {a) 131 men are at Rajkot, the Head Quarters of the Agency, where they are available for general duties. (b) 275 are on permanent duty, as at Thanas, &amp;c., within the four Political Divisions (or Prants) of the Agency, and are under the orders of the Political Assistants. (c) 140 are posted at various places, some of them only temporarily. (d) 61 are on escort duty with boundary settlement and other officers : and (e) 50are attached to the Superintendent of the Contingent, and employed with the Government Stallions, or on miscellaneous duties. 35. Pahlanpur Agency. —The arrangements as regards the Subah in com mand of this Division of the Contingent have been already explained in para. is no Special Superintendent as in Kattywar, and the Political Agent applies direct to the Subah on all matters connected with the Force, which in the latter Agency are referred by the Political Officers to the Superintendent of the Contingent, and reports to the Resident when necessary. There is a 'Reformed Iroop in this Division, consisting of 106 men of all grades, composed precisely as16 that in the Katty war Division, already described; The remainder of the Con tingent in this Agency consists of ordinary Raj war a Sowars, without uniform, discipline, or military organization of any kind. 1. Composition of the Force. The remarks under the heads noted 2. Horses. . in the margin, regarding the Kattywar 3. Arms and qmpmen s. Division, are generally applicable to this 5. Officers. and the other Divisions of the Force. Qf the 596 men in this Agency returned as on duty, 495 are posted at I'hanas, and 101 are employed on miscellaneous duties. 36 Mahi Kanta Agency. —The observations in the preceding para, are, gene rally, equally applicable to the portion of ths Contingent employed in this Agency. There are, however, two Reformed Troops, Eassaldars or Commandaiits ... 10 consisting of 184 men of »11 grades, and the NonSmZsioned Grades 01 ' 8 ^ 137 establishment is stated to include a fixed Trumpeters, Nagarchis, and Musicians 36 and fair proportion of superior and inferior Camel Sowars ... ... ... 5 officers, as noted in the margin.

Sowars... 715 men ^ an d pay or these classes, obtains m this, as in the Kattywar Agency. 37. Reiva Kanta Agency. —There is no Subah in charge of the portion of the Contingent employed in this Agency, and no ' Reformed Troop' as in the other Agencies, the whole Force consisting of ordinary' ' Rajwara' Sowars, composed as already described. The 156 men returned as on duty, are partly posted at 9 Thanas, and partly employed on detached duties. 38. Having stated the present formation and condition of the Contingent— as ascertained from the information that has been laid before us, and partly by personal inspection by two members of the Commission, of such portions of the # Force as could be conveniently assembled for the Mahi Kanta purpose at central and accessible points in the Rewa Kanta. three''' Agencies noted in the margin, and also at Baroda,—we next proceed to notice briefly the opinions of the several officers consulted, as to the character and efficiency of the Force, so far as the same has come under their observation. 39. Kattywar Agency—Mr. Peile, the late Acting Political Agent in Katty war, states that, in his opinion, the Contingent serving in that province is totally useless as a Military Police. This he ascribes (1) to its want of subordination to the officers under whom it is immediately employed, and (2) to its bad organiza tion and equipment. , (})■ regards the first, he points out that the Contingent is commanded \±1® t^v .bah, and superintended by a British Officer who is subordinate, not to the Political Agent, but to the Resident at Baroda, and, who has his Head (Quarters away from Rajkot, the Head Quarters of the Agency. Air. Peile urges that it is inexpedient that this arrangement shall continue, and lie suggests that the Superintendent should be the Personal Assistant of the ?v! o a , nd , r ? slde at Rajkot, where he might also be Station Magistrate, • 77, tile feuba h is to remain in command of the Force, he shall be vested SnnanW P ^ We I S 0V j r ^, under the observation of the Political Agent and the p endent, and not be checked and trammelled as at present.(2). As regards the organization of the Force, he proposes that five troops shall be formed of 120 men each, complete with officers, one to be at Depot Head Quarters at Rajkot under the Superintendent, and one to serve in each, of the four Political Divisions (or Prants) of the Agency, the latter to bo wholly under the control of the Prant Officers, who would supervise their pay, discipline, drill, arms, clothing, &amp;c., communicating on these matters, when necessary, with the Superintendent, who would be at all times in consultation with the Subah. The Prant Officers should also be empowered to object to any of the horses they deem unserviceable, which must be cast if the Superintendent concurs in their opinion. Should he not do so, the decision to rest with the Political Agent. (3). A code of Rules to be framed, laying down the powers of the Prant Officers and Subah respectively, regarding the punishment of offences. Non- military offences to be dealt with by the Criminal Courts of the Agency. (4). No hereditary claims to serve in the Contingent as Sowar to be recog nized, and the Superintendent to be empowered, with the approval of the Political Agent, to insist on the discharge of inefficient men, and to refuse to pass any man newly entertained, whom he deems unfit for the service. &lt; (5). The pay of the Force to be disbursed regularly through the Rajkot or Prant treasuries, and if the requisite funds for the purpose are not provided from Baroda, the disbursements on this account to be debited against the Gaekwar's Tribute. ; (6). In proposing that each Troop shall consist of 100 Sowars, with a com plement of 20 superior and subordinate officers, &amp;c., Mr. Peile observes that a large number of the class of Hubordinate officers is required, in consequence of the number of small parties each troop will have to provide for duty at Thanas The officers should, he considers, be trained soldiers. (7). The whole of the men to be one horse (Khodaspa) Silledars, and to receive Rs. 30 per mensem pay, the officers receiving the ordinary rates of cor responding ranks in the British service. No Bargirs to be allowed. The whole Force to be mounted on mares or geldings. (8). The uniform might be the same as that now in use by the ' Reformed Troop.' . ^ - ... ... , ^ (9). The arms to be good native swords, and carbines. Dep6ts of ammuni tion to be kept at the Head Quarters of each Prant and at Rajkot, and the men to be exercised in the use of their fire-arms. (10). Mr. Peile further states that the Special Officer for Police in Katty- war, should have a party of 20 men and 5 officers attached to him, separate from, and in addition to the 5 troops ;and adds that, in the Force of 625 disciplined men ; thus proposed, he has made no provision for His Highness the Gaekwar's Mahals in Kattywar, nor for any of the numerous miscellaneous escorts that are constant ly required. For this class of work, he thinks a less efficient description of Sowar would answer, and that 375 men might be maintained for these purposes, making the total force up to 1,000, which he considers should be its strength, instead of 900 as at present. Appended to Mr. Peile's report, are the opinions of several of the Agency Officers, who generally concur as to the inefficiency of the present Contingent as a Military Police. The reports of these officers do not appear to call for further notice here, but they will be filed with the general original proceedings of the Commission under this head. 17 r : &gt; J/18 40. Colonel Walker, the Superintendent of the Contingent, states that the condition of the men of the Force is generally fair, that there are some elderly men who, having no near relatives who could be appointed in their place and pro vide for their maintenance, are employed on light duties at Head Quarters, but that their number is being gradually reduced, as opportunities offer without much hardship to these old employes. (2). The condition of the horses depends on the amount of work given them, the season of the year, the quality of the fodder obtainable, the character of the season, and where employed. As a general rule, the horses are much overworked, and, owing to their employment on numerous small outposts, cannot be properly looked after by the officers of the Force. Colonel Walker is of opinion that, considering all things, the hprses are in fair condition, and, where consideration is shewn them by the officers under whose orders they are placed, that they may be said to be in good condition. He adds on this head, that we are ourselves to blame for any fault that may be found with the Contingent, as the overwork imposed on it not merely tells on the horses, but breaks the spirits of the men. Excepting in the matter of dressing the men, he has always found the Durbar ready to assist in keeping up the efficiency of the Force. (3). In a previous report, the Superintendent stated that he considered that, having regard to the work now demanded of the men, it was almost impossible for a Silledar with the present rate of pay, to keep himself, his family, and his horse in any part of the province, and that the inadequacy of the pay is the great difficulty that has to be contended with. If the work were reduced, the horses might be kept in good order on the present pay. He does not consider an in crease of pay at the present time absolutely necessary, though he would be glad to see such accorded to the men. The pay is disbursed most regularly, a large sum being always retained available for the purpose at the Head Quarters of the Force The ordinary pay given by the States in Kattywar, is Rs. 25, while the Agency Mohsali Sowars get Rs. 30 each, monthly. (4). He advocates the adoption of a cheap uniform for the Contingent, to distinguish the men from the numerous horsemen in the employ of all the States in Kattywar. ^5). The ' Reformed Troop' he considers to be well dressed and fairly equipped, j . he men, however, are not ' picked men,' and the horses are not as good as they should be. The latter point is, however, being remedied as vacancies occur, all newly-enrolled horses being passed by him. The exigencies of the service, and the constant employment of small detachments have interfered with the drilling of this troop; but it can work together fairly, and the superior officers are zealous and attentive to their duty. Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers are proportionately distributed m the 9 companies into which the Force is divided, but they get no increased pay. qo 9 0f the total number, 900, of which the Contingent is composed, only 832 men are fit for duty, the remainder being non-effectives. Of this number, dpHnH-L^ 0118 a + v y em J, 0 J 011 ou tpost, escort, and other similar duties; and as a not mnrp +K ttUS 7K 6111 nui 311611 on ^ eave ' an&lt; ^ s i c k men and horses, &amp;c,, there are that fhp wntt f , ® to meet sudden calls. The Superintendent is of opinion strength Force is employed, should either be reduced, or its form®-] v f ® C0 Qsiders that some of the duties taken by it, might be per- nTdoneL ^ ^ ^ of Sow . ars in the Province* If something is strength PnlrmTw n P resen t duties required from the Force, or to increase its that 14 Can ^ b — — -d -re disor-, ( ; (8). In conclusion, the Superintendent tegtifies to the great attention his representations, in any matters connected with the : Forc6, have always received from the Suhah and the Durbar. 41. Pahlanpur Agency. —Major Watson, Acting Political Agent at Pahlan- pur, in reporting upon the condition of the quota of Gaekwar horse serving in that province, states that its efficiency is very much superior to that of the Kattywar Contingent, with which he is well acquainted. He attributes this superiority to the fact that the Pahlanpur horse are more directly under the Political Superin tendent, and to the absence of any intermediate officer in charge. He remarks that while the Pahlanpur quota is not equrl to properly drilled troops, it has nevertheless captured and killed several outlaws during the past year. He con siders that the number might be reduced to 300 for the Pahlanpur districts, if the men were thoroughly efficient, but that this number should not include any Sowars required by the Brigadier General Commanding the Deesa Field Brigade. In fixing the number at 300 for good horsemen, he would add that 150 men of the Dhari Regiment should also be stationed at Pahlanpur for employment in the districts, as instances occur in which footmen are more useful than horsemen. In short, that 300 really efficient horsemen, and 150 footmen would be sufficient to keep order in his districts, whereas he finds the present number of 625 horse men, as at present constituted, insufficient. Major Watson considers the present rate of pay decidedly msufficTent, but he has received no complaints of irregularity in its disbursement. He cannot give ' the rates of pay assigned to each grade serving in each pagah or Govern ment detail,' as the information has not been furnished by the Subah. 42. Mahi Kanta Agency. —As regards the Contingent serving iri the Mahi Kanta, Major Legeyt, the Acting Political Agent, states that the dondition of the men and horses is generally good, and that the two Risalas of Reformed Horse are fairly armed. As regards the remainder of the Contingent, Ma |or ; Legeyt says that it is not so properly accoutred, but that it is efficient for ,^e,^w«rk on which it is employed, and adds that, if Government require an efficient fighting force, it cannot expect the Contingent to be this, as the Force has to perform 'duties of a nature which would try extremely the discipline of a goodjOavalry Corps.' Major Legeyt deprecates the system of giving Pagahs, oiit^rwhich the Pagadars hope to make money, to the detriment of the seryice. ; Major Legeyt thinks the efficiency of the Contingent would be increased i£.j.t was reduced from 1,000 to 800, 200 riding camels being substituted for the horses reduced. This, together with the more careful selection of Native Gommissioned and Non - Commissioned Officers, Major Legeyt thinks, is all that can be done, unless the Contingent is placed under European supervision altogether. ; 43 . Rewa Kanta A gency. —Captain Reeves, Acting Political Agent; reports oh the subject of the general condition of the men and horses of the Contingent serv ing in his districts. r ) (1). That as a rule the horses are underfed and not properly cared Tor; that the Agent has power to cast undersized or worn-out horses, and that the animals substituted by the Pagadar or Silledar are subject to his approval, before passing into the ranks* ' - ^ (2). That the men are useless for police or military purposes, because want ing in organization and discipline, but are useful in carrying the post, fetching witnesses, and for escort duty generally, though in some instances prisoners have escaped from them. r ,i . . , (3). That the Sowars' arms being their own property, they sell and. ex change them at pleasure | that these arms consist of swords, guiis, carbines, shields, spears, or pistols, according to fancy. .r; * ' ! ^ ^ 4(4). That it iS nbtorious that the meii are underpaid and that pay is irregu- larily disbursed; that occasionally a pagah is farmed out, and that the pay is subject to deductions, which go to swell the incomes of the various Kamdars and Karkuns attached to the pagahs, and that the very grain has to pay toll to various minor officials before it reaches the horses, though, as neither pay nor deductions are under the control of the Agent, heis unable to give precise information on the subject. In these matters, the Sir Subah, (His Highness' Prime Minister at Baroda), is supreme, and entertains and discharges men at pleasure. With regard to the question of the re-organization of the Force, and the Police- arrangements generally in his Agency, Captain Reeves would suggest that the different Native States and groups of estates should organize and maintain their own police forces—in the case of semi-independent and larger States both mounted and foot police, but in the case of the smaller or Mehwasi estates, foot police only —that 200 Sowars of the Contingent, (including officers), should be thoroughly drilled and disciplined; that a portion of these should be posted in the different Thanas as mounted constabulary, the rest, with the exception of a few special escorts, being kept together at Head Quarters for emergencies. With regard to the remainder of the Contingent, (114 men), Captain Reeves would advise that they be employed as at present on miscellaneous work, but that the whole body should be under the superintendence of an European Officer. The Agent would deprecate any reduction of the present strength of 314 horses, and indeed would suggest an increase of 100 undisciplined Sowars, if His Highness could be persuaded to agree, on the plea of the extent of territory to be guarded, which, and the number of men at his disposal, he contrasts with those, under both heads, of'the* other Agencies. 44. We now proceed to consider, with reference to the foregoing obser vations and opinions, the measures and rules in regard to the formation and equipment of the Contingent, its regular monthly pay, and the condition of its arms and accoutrements, that appear to us to be required to render it efficient for the duties it lias to perform, and that may fairly be insisted on, under the terms of the existing engagements, in respect of the Force, between the British and the Gaekwar's Governments. 15. It will be convenient to consider, in the first place, under this head, what these engagements bind the Gaekwar to, in respect of the Force, viz. . ® of the Treaty of 1817 binds the Gaekwar's Government to maintain, and hold at the disposal of the British Government, to act with the su si *ary orce, wherever it may be employed, and to be subject to the general control ot the officer commanding the British troops, a body of 3,000 effective $u ? supported exclusively at the expense of His Highness the Gaek- 1» v?* 5 j* 1 p, a 8 Highness will conform to the advice and suggestions of the milVrrr, 0 J® rnment relative to the forrnation and equipment of the same, its re- f-iT/jV/.) 1 # ^ Recondition of its arms and accoutrements then 6 Gaekwar s Government ' The mode of taking the muster is this Kodv nf tt ' ^ W 1 , 1C 1 ^ appears to have been originally intended that s body of Horse should be permanently located at Baroda itself.

The Agreement No. LXXXIL, dated 1st—8th February 1841,—under Page 349 of Vol. VI. of Aitchi- w Treaty of 1817, which had been abroga- son s Treaties. ted owing to the unfriendly conduct of the then tenance of+1 ia 'ric, i n j r. ? ae ^ w r a 5' was revived—provides (1) for the main- Gaekwar's rev^nt * ^ ?

It was, however, intimated to him, that, if he should, at any period, desire to reduce the Contingent to 1,500 men for employment in the Tributary Mahals, &amp;c., no objection would be raised by the British Government to the measure. It should be noticed here, that the employment of the Contingent in the Tributary Mahals, for Police purposes, though not authorised by the Treaty of 1817, or, apparently, any other special engagement, had been customary since its return from service in Malwa, in 1820. From and after 1841, it was continued in accordance with the above engagement, the whole body, however, and not merely 1,500 men, as proposed to JSis Highness, being, it would appear, held available for the duty. (3). The Agreement No. LXXXIII. of 14—17tli June 1858, remits the pay- . ment of 3 lakhs annually for the maintenance of Treaties 356 ' ^ ^ Aitchisons jfobert's Horse, cancels the permission accorded in 1841, to the prospective reduction of the Contin gent to 1,500 men, and declares that the provisions of Article 8 of the Treaty of 1817 shall continue in full force. It further provides for the continued employ ment of the whole body of the Contingent in the Tributary Mahals, as the British Government may require, when it is not needed to serve with the Subsidiary Force. 46. The sum of the engagements now in force, as stated in the preceding para., is that the Contingent shall be maintained as provided in Article 8 of the Treaty of 1817, and that its employment in the Tributary Mahals, when not required for Military service, rests with the British Government. 47. With regard to the formation, &amp;c., of the Contingent, as described in Article 8 of the Treaty of 1817, we presume that the words ' according to the customs of the Gaek war's Government' used in that Article, include the formation, equipment, regular payment, and condition of the arms and accoutrements of the Force ; and that, though the Gaekwar is bound to conform to the advice and 'suggestions of the British Government on all these points, he is so only to the extent of ' the customs of his Government' in respect of such matters. It is true that the term ' effective cavalry' is also employed in this Article, in reference to the Contingent, and this has been pointed out and strongly urged by many of the officers who have written on the subject, but it appears that there is reason to believe that the word ' effective' does not exist at all in the Vernacular version of the Treaty, as it is wholly omitted in the copy in the Residency Office at Baro- da. The omission is in itself of little consequence; but if there is any doubt as to the use of the word in the Vernacular version with the Durbar, it will be advisa ble to make no reference to the term in dealing with the question in this Report. 48. Proceeding then under the impression that our proposals must be in accordance with the 'customs of the Gaekwar's Government,' we will consider seriatim :— (1). What the customs are, in respect of each of the points noted ; and— (2). What measures and rules can, in our opinion, be adopted, to render the Force efficient for the purposes for which it is needed in the Tributary Mahals, without being at variance with the said customs. 49. As regards the former :— I.— F ormation op the F orce. The Contingent was originally composed of (1) State Pagahs. (2) Sirdars'Pagahs and Silledars. (3) Sebandi horse. A small proportion of foot was also associated with it.22 At the present time, it is composed of a large number (1) of State and Sir dars' Paffahs- (2) of Silledars with one or more horses, and is understood to have been formed into separate companies, as prescribed in the Rules appended to the Gaekwar's Kharita to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay, dated 12th Feb ruary 1868, though this formation is described as being merely nominal on the most essential points. The Pagadar system in its ordinary condition is wholly inconsistent with C efficiency for the work required of the Contingent in The Pagahs. the Tributary Mahals. The Pagadars are never present with their Pagahs, and their places are filled by Deputies who have little influence or authority, and get no extra pay, and there is no proper establishment of subordinate officers. The Division of the Force generally into separate companies under the Rules of 1868 already referred to, though reported to have been nominally cairied out, does not appear to have materially rectified the above state of things ; the course taken having been to appoint the Kamdar of the largest Pagah in a company to the command, and to fill up the subordinate ranks similarly from the other Kam- dars or Silledars, without reference to the fitness of the individual, and without any increase of pay. But the formation of the Reformed Troops—(that in Kattywar is composed wholly of 2 Pagahs, one belonging to the State, the other to a Sirdar, with two selected officers at its head)—-shews that the system, unsuited as it is for the object in view, is susceptible of improvement, if the Gaekwar's Government will consent to the adoption of such an organization generally for all the Pagahs. It is, how ever, essential that all the officers, whether superior or subordinate, of troops so composed, shall be selected men, and paid properly, and that discipline and sub ordination to their authority from all under them, shall be duly enforced. The ' Reformed' portion of the Contingent, organized as already described, consists of (4) four Risalas of 401 men of all grades; and though it is not in all respects as efficient as might be desired, it is generally fairly spoken of, and under really good Native Commandants, and with some further moderate improve ments, would probably be found equal to the ordinary duties properly claimable from the Force, if its employment were restricted to those duties, and the men and horses were protected against the harassing sort of miscellaneous work, on which the Contingent is now used, more or less, in all the Agencies, and the performance of much of which is altogether inconsistent with efficiency of the very lowest standard. The Silledars and their Bargirs are included in the company formation, some , „ of the most respectable of the body being selected for e i e ars, the subordinate class of officers, but, as already remark ed, these get no extra pay, and possess no real authority or influence amongst their comrades. i' Amongst the Silledars are certain men styled ' Mankaris,' who would pro bably be unwilling to serve under such an organization as that of the ' Reformed - Troops,' and in the event of an extension of that organization, it would in such case be necessary to omit them therefrom. All other Silledars might, however, be included in it. IT.— E quipment of the F orce. The personal equipment of the men will be referred to under the head of ' Arms and Accoutrements.'23 III.—Regular Monthly Payment of the Force. I* So far as the Commission has been able to ascertain, the arrangements for V V the regular monthly payment of the Contingent are at present generally fair and ^ {efficient. Some officers who have written on the subject speak of delays in the Jl' p* issue of pay and deductions therefrom at the hands of various persons as being - common. In one report reference is also made to the practice of if' / Pagahs, by which is probably meant, the giving on contract the Feeding of ' } p a gadars'horses ridden by Bargirs, which is expressly forbidden in the rules of 1868. On these points, no direct information has come to the knowledge of the / r . Commission, but the general results of its enquiries on them has led to the con- f elusion that the authorised rate of pay is, as a rule, disbursed regularly and . without deductions, except such as are made at the request, or with the con currence of the men. The conversion of the Baroda currency in which the pay is issued into British currency, which is that in use where the Contingent is employed, involves some loss to the men, and some measure appears to be called for to relieve them there- ^ from. IV.—Arms and Accoutrements. The ordinary equipments of the class of troops of which the Contingent is composed, though suited perhaps to the work on which they used to'be employed in former times, cannot be said to meet adequately the requirements of the duty for which they are now maintained in the Tributary Mahals. The men wear no uniform, and their Turbans even are of different colours. Their arms are swords, matchlocks or spears. The swords and spears might doubt less with a little attention be made efficient, but they are at present uncared for and in bad order. The matchlocks are quite worthless. The saddlery and horse appointments are after no fixed pattern, and the general appearance of horse and man is certainly ragged, and the reverse of soldierly. All these points have, however, been fairly rectified in the Reformed Troops, and might, doubtless, be so in the rest of the Force, if the Gaekwar would consent ^thereto. The Rules of 1868 referred to in the foregoing paras, may be regarded as illustrating, as far as they go, '' the customs of the Gaekwar's Government,' as modified by it to meet the requirements of the Contingent, and a copy of them will be found in the Appendix appertaining to this part of the Report. 50. Next, as to the measures and Rules we would recommend for adoption, under the terms of the foregoing remarks, to render the force efficient for the pur poses for which it required. I.—Formation of the Force. We have come to the conclusion, after an attentive perusal of the several ^ opinions that have been recorded on this point, including the views of the Bombay ? No. 31- t ., dated 26th July 1873, Government as set forth in the despatch noted to the Secretary to the Governmeiit in the margin, that the formation of the Contingent of India. into separate companies, as ordered in the Rules of 1868, will best meet the difficulties connected with it, provided that the measure is carried out in a real and effective manner, by the selection of fit men for the superior and subordinate grades of officers, and the due enforcement of discipline and subordination amongst all ranks.tyyi- H The arrangements necessary for the distribution' of the Pagahs, so as to form' them into companies, will require much consideration and discrimination, and it' M will be absolutely necessary, from the first, to have it clearly understood that no- /. interference of any sort can be permitted on the part of Pagadars m respect of men or horses of their Pagahs serving m the companies of the Contingent and j that both, while so serving, will be wholly under the orders and control of the Com pany Commandant. There will be less difficulty in embodying the Silledars in the manner proposed, but no man of this class should be enrolled in the companies, who is not prepared to perform the duties of his grade, and to render full obedience to the officers placed over him. Obiection has been taken to the employment of Bargirs in the Contingent; but it appears to the Commission that such cannot be urged under the circumstances of the constitution of the Force. If the Company Commandants do their duty, the Bargirs will be required to keep themselves and horses in a condition of effi ciency. The established complement of each company, as laid down in Section I. of the Rules, ^ appears to be in all respects suitable and to require no amendment, excepting perhaps the number of Jemadars, which might be reduced to two. A karkun will be needed with each to keep the Cluster Rolls and A-ccounts, but he should be a non-effective, and not included in the effective complement of 100 ft- men. i» V As regards the men and horses, no man or horse should be retained in the Force that is not really efficient for the description of work required of both. Old or worn-out men should be discharged periodically, and a minimum age—as 18 years—laid down for new enrolments. Horses are not necessarily unfit for such service as that required of the Contingent, because they are not of the Cavalry standard, but they should be strong and serviceable. In Katty war at the pre sent time, the height of the horses is believed to be, generally, considerably below the Cavalry standard, but there will probably be no lack of hardworking and fairly serviceable animals of about 13-^ or 14 hands, and the former might be made the minimum height for new enrolments. The horses should be subjected to periodical casting inspections, when all unfits from any cause should be cast and struck off. Men once enrolled as Silledars in the Contingent should not be liable to removal or dismissal, except On special grounds justifying such a measure, of which the British Officer under whom the Force is serving should always be duly and fully informed before hand. II.—The Regular Monthly Two questions appear to call for consideration under this head :— (1). The rates of pay that should be fixed for each grade. (2). The arrangements for the punctual disbursement of pay. (1). Though the right of insisting on adequate rates of pay for the Contin gent is not specially reserved to G-overnment in the Treaty, its title to be satisfied j that the rates are sufficient for the due efficiency of the Force, cannot, in the opi nion of the Commission, be doubted. 1 , Note. The distribution of the Pagahs into companies, alleged to have boen already carried out, tvill clearly require revision. r &gt; o 24 i ■ t ,' y/25 ■ / 4 i \&amp; i J J ' - v, The present rates are stated to be Babja^ai.^s^^ ,^4 ^Q fpr S^eid^rf ^d Bargirs respectively in the Reformed Troops, and Bal)asai Es. 29 and 8 similarly in the remainder of the Force. ,„ f ,, t . / The necessity for an increase being made to the latter rates is strongly urged by every officer who has written on the subject, though Colonel Walker, the Su perintendent of the Kattywar Force, states that he does not consider that, such is absolutely needed at the present moment. As, however, British Es. S^Sfper mensem is the ordinary rate paid by most, if not all, of the Kattywar State^nich maintain Sowars of a very low standard, it appears tons that Es. 23-9-0, which is the equivalent in British currency of Babasai lis. 29, is certainly less than the j Contingent should receive. On a full consideration of the present circumstances of the Force, and the changes it is proposed to introduce into it—some of which will involve addition al expense to the men—we are of opinion that the pay of each Sowar and Bargir should be British Rs. 29 and 9 respectively per mensem. These rates are a little in excess of those now in force for the Reformed Troops and ought to suffice. The pay of the officers and others should 0 , , p 're ^ inn be in proportion to that fixed for the men, Subadar «s. 76 to 100. i r r u . ,, &gt; ' • . i • Jemadar ... 40 and we would suggest the rates noted m Havildar 36 the margin as suitable. Naik 32 (2). As already stated, the present Na^cW ^^ ** 29 arrangements for the regular monthly Naobatti ... 29 payment of the Contingent appear to be Trumpeter 29 generally fair and efficient. It will, however, be necessary under the proposed system, if adopted, that the pay of all Silledars and Bargirs in a company shall be disbursed in presence of the Commandant, who shall certify to the same m the Acquittance Roll of the company. -i The Commission is further of opinion that the pay of the Gontingent should be issued in the British currency, which alone will secure the men from inconve nience and loss from exchange. c The necessary arrangements for the payment of the Force might be made through the British Local Treasuries where it is employed, or through Native Bankers, as is the common practice in the case of many British Local Corps, ^ III.— -Arms and Accoutrements. The uniform, arms, and equipments generally of the Reformed Risalas appear to be suitable, and should, in the opinion of the Commission, be adopted for the whole Force. The Arms consist of swords and carbines, and it might be desirable to add a spear in the case of a certain proportion of the Force. The carbines should be provided by the State, as also the ammunition—service and practice—required for them. The Horse Equipments should be all of the same description and pattern, but it is quite unnecessary that they or the uniform and accoutrements should be of a costly character. 51. With regard to the details of discipline and the enforcements of sub ordination in the Contingent, the existing arrangements for the control of the / IForce are generally alleged to be wholly inadequate, and it is clear that, without some change on this bead, the proposed organization will be defective on the most essential point. (1). It has been already explained that the Head of the Contingent is the Sir Subah, who is the G-aekwar's Minister and resides at Baroda. It would appear that, formerly, this office merged in that of the Senapati, to whom the Subahs reported direct, and the Commission has no doubt that the change has had a mischievous result, by introducing a new and probably embarrassing element into the control arrangements of the Force. (2). The Subahs, who are the nominal commandants of the chief divisions of the Contingent, have certain powers of fine and imprisonment, and can suspend Silledars and dismiss Birgirs ; bat thair authority appears to be inadequate to the due enforcement of discipline and obedience amongst the men under their charge, and they are, it is alleged, checked and interfered with by the Karkuns attached to their offices, and are so dependent on Court influence at the Capital, that they cannot always use the authority they possess in a proper and vigorous manner. Colonel Walker's report on this head, as regards the Subah of the Kattywar por tion of the Force, is not unfavourable; but the correspondence before the Commis sion is conclusive as to the insufficiency of the Subahs' powers to maintain disci pline in the Force under their charge. It appears to us that, if the organization now proposed be adopted, it will be absolutely necessary for the Durbar to delegate to the Subahs larger powers then they now possess, and to require them to perform their duties with much more energy and attention than has heretofore been the practice. (?)• are farther of opinion that, in the present condition of the Contin gent, it will be hopeless to expect that the proposed organization can be carried out m a way to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the case, without the immemate supervision and control of a British Officer, specially nominated to that duty, for each division of the Force, and associated with the Subah in command, through whom it would be necessary for him to work. The discharge of 611 h ? r 1f' however ' should, as regards the question of efficiency or otherwise, rest wholly with the Superintendent accord witlTth^p 0 f as ^ lus su ggested, is not altogether in 0ffiC ' ^ve written regarding the Contin- and subordinate to ^ For ? e bein g Meetly controlled by without anv such JntPr 6 ° ltlca ^ Officers, withm whose districts it is serving, poses that as reffard^^ 0r ln ^® rv ®® in &amp; authority.

Whether the Superintendents, if appointed, should be directly under the orders of the Political Agents, as their Assistants,—as proposed by Mr. Peile,— or merely subject to their general authority in respect of the distribution and employment of the Force, while they report to the Resident, when necessary, on all matters connected with its internal economy and discipline, is a point on which there is some difference of opinion. The former arrangement would undoubtedly strengthen the hands of the Political Agents, and be more convenient and agreeable to them, while the latter would of course be preferred by the Durbar, and would perhaps have the advantage of ensuring an uniformity of system in the proceedings of the Superintendents. Looking to the practice elsewhere, it is not clear to us that the entire dependence of the Superintendents on the Political Agents is absolutely essen tial, and such an arrangement, under the peculiar circumstances of this Force might be open to objection. (4). The due mustering of the Force is a most important question, and special precautions appear to be called for to ensure the maintenance and presence for duty of the full number of men that ought to be available under the Treaty. With this object, a Nominal Roll of each company should be prepared as soon as the formation of the company is completed, under the signature of the Com pany Commandant, and copies of the same should be furnished by the Subahs to the Superintendents, or the other British Officers under whose control the Force is employed, and be filed for record by them. Musters should be taken and Muster Rolls prepared on the first da} 7 of each month, and copies of the same, signed as above, regularly furnished to the Super intendents, who would thus be kept informed of the state of each company. The duty on which every man absent from muster is employed, should be clear ly stated in the Muster Rolls. Every Detachment or Detail from the Head Quarters of a Company should be furnished with a certificate from the Officer commanding the Company stating where and on what duty it is employed. This certificate should contain a Nomi nal Roll of the men composing such detachment, and the officer commanding the detachment should be prepared to produce it, whenever required to do so by the Subah or Superintendent, or the Political Officer within whose district he is em ployed. With these precautions and occasional inspections by the Superinten dents, the maintenance of the proper complement would, it is thought, be fairly kept under check. 52. Having thus submitted our views on the foregoing points, we deem it to be our duty to add, that no permanent benefit can be looked for from the measures we have proposed, without a complete and radical change in the pre sent mode of employing the Contingent. Complaints of the inefficient and non-military character of the Force are made by almost every Officer, who has written on the subject, but many of the duties on which it is used are altogether inconsistent with efficiency in any shape, or of the very lowest standard. It is unnecessary for us to enter here into any details on this point, but references thereto will be found in the letters which form an appendix to this part of the Report. The mode of employment to which we allude has doubtless been the growth of circumstances. The Contingent has been at hand and has been freely used as exigency or occasion arose, but the result is that which now forms the subject of such general complaint and reproach. According to our view, the re-organized Contingent should be employed solely.28.. on the oidinary duties that would devolve on Local Horse, or Mounted Police in the British Service. It should be kept together as much as possible, in order to ensure proper supervision and a reasonable amount of discipline. Due care of the Horses, Arms, Uniforms, and Equipments should be systematically enforced. The locality of permanent posts should be fixed on, as much as possible, with reference to their central position—in respect of the work such posts may have to (jo g0 as to avoid unnecessarily harassing the men and horses. Careful arrange ments on this point, with a good system of patrolling, would probably render the employment of some, at least, of the present numerous detachments unnecessary. The practice of using the Contingent Sowars for carrying the Dak and com munications all over the country, for escort duties of every description—some of which greatly try both men and horses—and of allowing them to be employed by minor Native Officials, should, we are of opinion, be forbidden. Such duties are unsuited and ruinous to mounted men, and looking at the cost of maintenance of the latter, it is a waste of money and material to employ them thereon. Colonel Walker supplies a statement of posts furnished by the Contingent, under r Native Officials who are paid by the Talukdars concerned, which he urges should be reduced, the employment of the Contingent on such duties being in future exceptional, instead of as at present a matter of course. It is no doubt very desirable that the practice of establishing such posts should be restricted as much as may be possible, but the Commission is not in a position to judge how far this may be practicable. With a properly organised system of foot police in the several States con cerned, the demands on the Contingent should be greatly reduced; and where the States maintain Sowars themselves, we see no reason why they should not undertake with them some of the sort of work referred to above as unfitting for the Contingent, but which may yet, from local circumstances, require mounted men for their performance. Efficiency of a soldierly or even police character is not looked for from esta blishments of the ordinary class maintained by the States, but the Contingent is expected to be at all times ready for any hard work or active service that may be required of it, and it appears to the Commission, to be necessary to protect it as much as possible from any employment which is clearly inconsistent with such an expectation. The British Officers in Kattywar, who are at times required to take the field against outlaws of the Waghirs and other desperate classes in that peninsula, are stated to be chiefly dependent on the Contingent in their pursuit and suppression of these local pests, and it is clearly necessary that the men with whom they undertake this important duty shall be fairly efficient and trustworthy, and that, so far as may be practicable, the body generally shall be relieved from all duties which are admitted to be inconsistent with these essentials. Lastly, with reference to the proposals that have been made for reforming a portion of the Contingent, and allowing the rest to remain as at present, for the performance of the miscellaneous class of duties to which we have taken objection, we beg to record our opinion that it will be far better to deal with the whole Contingent as a body in this matter, and to fix definitely for the future the stan dard of efficiency up to which the British Government decides that must be brought. That standard, if the measures proposed by us be approved and fairly carried 0 ' Jt ' ?? ^ a high one, when regarded from a military point of view, but it snould suffice for the purpose required. 53. With reference to para. 15 of your Despatch No. 2209- p . of the 19th ep ember, we beg to state that we have no doubt that the adoption of our proposals wiH render the employment in the Tributary Mahals of so large a Force f S , • 6 xi strength of the Contingent unnecessary, and that we have reason to e leve a 2,000 men, if so reformed, would probably be equal to, or somewhat excess of, the actual requirements of these districts: under this head. Should29 / ' this prove to be the case, a very large reduction of the Force would be practicable, and the conversion of a portion of it into Foot Police, if required for the adminis tration of the Districts, might undoubtedly be effected with a large saving to the Gaekwar's Government. The Commission is not in possession of the information needed to enable it to submit an accurate opinion as to the number of Foot Police that would pro bably be required, in the above event; but, if the several States concerned are com pelled to perform their duty as regards their own territory, it is not probable that any very large Force would be needed, and the cost would certainly be far less than the amount of saving that might be effected by the reduction of the Contingent. The necessity for a Foot Police, in part substitution of the existing Contin gent arrangements, would probably be confined to Malu Kanta ' Rewa the Agencies noted in the margin. From the re port of the Political Superintendent of Pahlanpur, it would appear that 150 men would suffice for his charge, and a like number would, it is believed, meet the requirements of the Rewa Kanta Agency. If these figures be correct, an aggregate of 500 men would probably be ample for the three Agencies. The Commission cannot, however, say that so large a number will be needed, and it thinks that such might not be the case, if the obligation to maintain their own Foot Police were duly enforced in the States of these Agencies. 54. The foregoing proposals have been framed in accordance with the in structions conveyed in your Despatch of 19th September last, on the understand ing that the existing engagements regarding the Contingent are to remain in force; but we are well aware, from the whole of the circumstances which have come before us in connection with this subject, of the serious character of the difficulties that will be experienced in workinp out those proposals and giving them a fair trial, and that, if adopted, many causes may conspire to prevent their proving successful. The traditions connected with the Contingent for the last 50 years and upwards, are not hopeful on this point. It has been the subject of endless cor respondence and disagreement, and considering the original constitution of the Force and the nature of the service required of it in the Tributary Mahals, it ought perhaps to be no matter of surprise that this has been the case. Though, therefore, we have proposed the measures that appear to us, after the fullest consideration, to be the most suitable for adoption under the existing engagements, we deem it to be our duty to submit, for the consideration of His Excellency in Council, that it would in our opinion be far preferable, under all the, circumstances, to endeavour to obtain a revision of these engagements, with the view of substituting for them an arrangement which would relieve the Gaek war's Government, altogether, from its present obligations in respect of the Con tingent, and furnish the means for the maintenance, under the direct orders of the British Government, of such a police force as would meet the real requirements of the Tributary Mahals, on the points hitherto provided for, or supposed to be pro vided for by the Contingent. Such an arrangement would, the Commission feels assured, be advantageous alike to both Governments, and it would remove finally a fruitful and endless cause of dispute and disagreement, which cannot be set at rest in any other way. To obviate the necessity for the dismissal of the large body of men now com posing the Contingent, that would in such event have to be dealt with, any of them found fit for service might be retained for employment in the police force that would have to be raised under the new arrangements, and the remainder, who would be recalled to Baroda when no longer required in the Tributary Mahals, might be gradually absorbed into the other State establishments there, oi otherwise disposed of as the Gaekwar's Government might think proper. No doubt many of the men who are old and nearly worn out, would be glad to30 accept a fair sum as gratuity on retirement, and by this and other means the cost of the measure might, it is thought, be brought within limits which would not exceed the present charges borne by His Highness* Government on account of the Contingent. 55. Having brought our labours to a conclusion, we venture to express our earnest hope that the results of our enquiries, though not—owing to the peculiar circumstances of-the case—of so decided and satisfactory a character as we should ourselves have desired, will yet prove sufficient to enable the Government of India to take such action on the questions at issue, as may in its opinion be called for, in the interests of His Highness the Gaekwar and his people, and for the due settle ment of the long standing disagreement regarding the Contingent. We have the honor to be Sir,Report of Baroda Commission. APPENDIX A.Report of Baroda Commission. „ APPENDIX PAET I.SCHEDULE I. Case No. 4. Complaint of Sadak Ali Maddat Ali, Camel contractor of Ahmedabad, a British subject. The complainant was employed by the late Gaekwar Khanderao for some years as a contractor for supplying camels to the pagah and military establish ments, and at the time of that Chief's demise had 122 camels so employed. Subsequent to that event he was required to pay a sum of Ks. 800 to the then Dewan as a Nazarana, and as a difficulty arose about his paying the full amount, and the Dewan was informed he had abused his karkun, his establishment, con sisting at the time of 94 camels, was attached and confiscated together with some carts and bullocks, his private property. This was about seven months after Khanderao's death, or about May 1871. Complainant petitioned the Resident, and the Bombay authorities, but could get no redress. About five or six months after the attachment of his establishment, or about October or November 1871, he was seized and imprisoned by order of the Dewan, who, a few days after, had him brought handcuffed to his house at night and directed him to give a receipt in full for all arrears due to him, and to sign a statement that he had no complaint to make to the British Government against that of the Gaekwar. On complain ant's demurring to sign such papers, the Dewan ordered the men, in whose charge he was, to compel him to do so, whereupon they tied a rope to his hand cuffs, and fastening it to the roof pulled him up by the wrists, when he swung round, and fell to the ground breaking his right arm. He was then taken back to jail, where he remained six weeks, when he was released on his wife's petition ing the Resident, after signing a bond for lis. 200, not to go near the Palace, the Dewan's house, and the pagah head quarters. On his release complainant peti tioned the Resident, by whose order some five or six months afterwards the Assis tant Resident enquired into his case, and after an investigation of it directed the payment of the arrears, Rs. 3,000, due to him, and the restitution of his property. Complainant claimed a further sum of Bs. 7,000 as compensation for the loss and injury he had sustained, but the Assistant Resident referred him to the Resident regarding it. The Assistant Resident's order was objected to by the Durbar, and after some days the Resident told him he was to get nothing. Subsequently, hearing that he was to be arrested, complainant went to Bom bay where he remained for six months. On his return to Baroda he found that a 'Rath' (native bullock carriage) of his, worth Rs. 260, had been sold during his absence by order of the Durbar for Rs. 8. Complainant has hitherto failed to obtain any redress or compensation from the Durbar. 2. The complainant produces three witnesses in support of his case. The first, who was in his service when his establishment was attached, and had known him for 15 years, states that his arm was all right when he was imprisoned, some ten months after Khanderao's death, that he used to lift up weights, &amp;c., but that he did not know what was under his sleeve. (2) The second, who Avas also in his service up to the same period, states that he was imprisoned two months after Khanderao's death, that his arm had been broken two years previously by the bite of a camel, but that he had not witnessed the occurrence; that he had seen the broken arm before the complainant's imprisonment, and that he was in the habit of wearing an iron splint on it, (3) The third who states he was in jail, on a charge of murder two and a half years ago, with the complainant, deposes that his arm was all right when he came there, and for some days afterwards, and that he used it in the ordinary way ; that he was taken away by sepoys one evening, and on his return three hours afterwards was put into a separate cell, the other a—4 12 prisoners being forbidden to notice him. He called out as if m pam, and after wards pointed to his arm, as if suffering from it, but deponent, though m prison with, him for 20 or 22 days after this occurrence, did not know what injury had happened to him. 3. The Durbar Agent, in his remarks on this case, denies that the complain ant is entitled to protection as a British subject, his residence in Baroda previous to his imprisonment having exceeded six months. He further states that complainant owed Us. 400 to the State, which he was called on by the khas pagah karkun to settle, and that on his threatening to beat the latter, he was taken to the Naib Dewan, and ordered to be bound over to ke^p the peace. As he would not furnish security he was detained in the police sta tion (cliabutra) for a month and twenty days, when he was released, tie was subjected to no ill treatment. From the Station Descriptive Roll of prisoners it appears, the Durbar Agent adds, that he had sustained the injury to his arm before his imprisonment. The Resident, Colonel Shortt, did not mention to the Durbar that such injury had occurred in the jail. With reference to the Durbar s statement to Colonel Phayre that the complainant had not been put in jail, the Agent suggests that a mistake may have been made at the time of writing to that effect, or that there was a misconception regarding the word used, the man having been confined in the Police ' chabutra', and not imprisoned in the jail. The statement was made on the report of the Karkun. The Agent further produces at the request of the Commission the Descrip tive Roll of prisoners confined in the chabutra referred to in his preceding remarks, which on inspection is found to contain the usual record of the complain ant's committal on the 22nd April 1872. In the column of 'Description of the . . . prisoners' is the remark noted in the margin in a iujur^' 18 rigW arm 18 an separate line by itself at the foot of the entry. This line appears to the Commission to be written in a different hand and at a different time from the rest of the record in that column, and on the circumstance being pointed out to the Durbar Agent, he admits that it is so open to suspicion as a subsequent entry, that he requests permission to with draw the Register as evidence on the point. 4. Dr. Seward, Residency Surgeon, having carefully examined the com plainant's injured arm, deposes before the Commission that he is satisfied that the injury could not have been caused by the bite of a camel, that he is of opinion that the complainant's account of the manner in which it took place is a true one, and that the injury must have occurred at least 18 months ago. &gt; r ^ e only documents connected with this case forthcoming in the Residency records are (1) a Durbar yad, dated 15th August 1872, replying to one from the Resident, dated 11th May 1872, forwarding a petition from complainants wiie regarding his imprisonment. No allusion was made in any of these papers to complainant's arm having been injured. The DurbaT yad states the views of the Government as to complainant's claims and the proceed ings that had been taken towards him, and remarks that he had been required to give security in consequence of having used threatening language towards the pagah officers, but had not hem imprisoned ; and (2) a petition from Sadak Ali to the Resident, dated 11th November 1872, with a precis of the same prepared in the Residency office, endorsed by the Resident, Colonel Shortt, and signed by nun. I his petition gives a full detail of complainant's grievances and states the circumstances under which his arm was broken from the ill treatment to which he alleged he had been subjected. The Resident's endorsement is to this effect—' A verbal answer was given to returned^ 1161 ' Residerit 011 the I6tli November 1872, that his petition was3 6. In consequence of the conflicting statements regarding the injury to the complainant's arm, the Commission deemed it desirable to refer to Cap tain Hancock, the Assistant Resident, who is alleged by Sadak Ali to have investigated his complaint by order of the Resident, and to have awarded him Rs. 3,000 as the balance due to him by the Durbar, In his reply dated 20th December 1873, which will be found in the file of the case, Captain Hancock states that the complainant's claims were referred to him by the Resident for report, and that he made out the account shewing a small amount in favour of Sadak Ali. The Resident, however, did not accept his award, and subsequently continued the investigation himself the. complainant. At the time of the enquiry held by him, (Captain Hancock), mention was made hy complainant of his ar having been practised on him by the Durbar complaint. 7. In his final letter on this case dated 27th December 1873, the Resident reviews the whole of the circumstances connected with it, and urges that the complainant's charge of ill-treatment has been fully established. General Observations and Opinion op the Commission. I.—The complainant though warnedby the Resident to produce adequate proof of his being a British subject, has not brought forward any evidence on the point. The Resident has, however, expressed his full belief that he was so when he came to Baroda and the Commission accepts his view on this head, and admits the complaint as appertaining to Schedule I, and to be dealt with by it ac cordingly. II. The grievance of the complainant consists (1) of the attachment of his establishment and personal property, and the non-payment of the arrears he claims, and (2) of the personal injury sustained by him at the hands of the Durbar officials. With regard to the former, the Commission considers that a British subject who enters the service of a Native Chief has / ordinarily / no title to the protection of the British Government in respect of transactions connected with or arising out of such service, and there is nothing of so special a character in this part of the complainant's case as to call for exceptional treatment in this respect at its hands. It therefore declines to enter into any enquiry regarding Sadak Ali's pecuniary claims against the Durbar. With regard to the latter^it is not clear that British subjects, circumstanced as the complainant was at the time of the alleged personal ill-treatment to which he states he was subjected, have a valid claim to the protection of the British authorities against the Durbar, at the hands of whose servants such ill- treatment may occur. In this case, Sadak Ali had been for several years in the service of the Baroda State, and the Durbar appears to have had good ground for regarding him as one of its own subjects, or at least of being equally amenable with the latter to its jurisdiction in respect of his conduct as a servant of the State or of any proceedings or property of his within Baroda limits. Looking, however, to the objects of its assembly, the Commission has no hesitation in From Government Of India deciding that this part of the complainant's grievance to Government of Bombay, should form the subject of enquiry by it under the No. 2209-p, dated 29th Sep- terms of para. 5 of the letter noted in the margin, tember 1873. and it therefore proceeds to consider the same accor dingly. III. The complainant alleges that a very serious personal injury, involving the fracture of bis right arm, the bones of which still remain separated, and can4 s never now be re-united, was inflicted on him under circumstances of cruel violence by certaia Durbar servants when he was handcuffed and helpless in their power. IV The Police Chabutra register that has been produced, fixes the date of the alleged iniury at about the end of April 1872, as it shews that he was received at the Station on the 22nd of that month, and Sadak Ah asserts that he was ill, treated as described seven days afterwards. On the 11th May, the Resident addressed a yad to the Durbar regarding his imprisonment in reference to a petition from his wife on the subject, and in its reply dated 15th August or three months later, the Durbar explained the case and de nied that he had been imprisoned. V. Meanwhile, or about the 11th June, according to the complainant's and the Durbar statements before the Commission of the duration of his confinement, Sadak Ali was released, and he at once petitioned the Resident for redress as to his pecuniary claims, but appears to have made no reference to the ill-treatment he had suffered. His claim was transferred by the Resident to his Assistant for enquiry, and after investigation by him, in the course of which the Foujdar and his Karkun are admitted by the complainant to have been present, a small amount was awarded as being due to him from the Durbar, the matter of the injury to his arm never having been alluded to by the complainant during such investiga tion. The Resident, however, did not concur in this decision of his Assistant, and took the case into his own hands, and ultimately apparently refused to interfere. YI. Up to this time, November 1872, no mention appears to have been made by complainant of the injury to his arm, but on the 11th of that month he addressed a petition to the Resident, in which, amongst his other grievances he, for the first time, brought it forward. On the 16th of the same month, the Resident informed complainant verbally that his petition was returned, that his com plaint was dismissed, 'and an endorsement to this effect was recorded on the Residency Office precis of the petition. It is much to be regretted that the pro ceedings of the Resident's Assistant in the investigation of the case held by him are not forthcoming, but they cannot be traced, VII. The evidence adduced by complainant before the Commission in support of the alleged injury to his arm as described by him, is conflicting. Of two witnesses examined, both formerly in his service, one states that his arm was all right, when he was imprisoned, while the other alleges that it had been broken two years pre viously by the bite of a camel, and that he had been in the habit of wearing an iron splint on it. A third witness who was in jail with him deposes that he used his arm in the ordinary way when he came to jail, but that after his return when taken away for 3 hours some nights afterwards, he called out as if in pain, and Used to point to his arm. This witness though confined for 20 or 22 days with complainant did not however know what had happened to him. _ VIII. The evidence of the Residency Surgeon is opposed to the idea of the injury having been caused by the bite of a camel, and is favourable to the com plainant's account of the manner in which he alleges it occurred, but is of course inconclusive on the latter point. IX The evidence offered by the Durbar in proof of the complainant's arm having been mjured when he was admitted to the Police Chabutra, viz., the lecord of the fact m the Station Register, would have been conclusive on the point, if trustworthy, but the Commission is satisfied that the entry was not an original one, and it is compelled to concur with the Resident that it'was probably made recently witii an intention to deceive the Commission. X. If this view be correct, the fact of no note of the complainant's arm being injured when admitted having been made in the descriptive co- 1 ? fv! S n 7 i 0 V g y . in su PP ort of his assertion that it was then sound, but the Commission, while giving every weight to this important point, feels4 itself absolutely unable to reconcile liis statement of the injury with his silence regarding it for so many months, and under circumstances which gave him full opportunity and furnished the strongest inducements for his bringing it forward and making the most of it. Further, looking to the fact that his case was inquired into by the then Resident, when the real truth was more likely to be got at than at the present time, and that he dismissed it, the Commission cannot accept that statement as having been so clearly established as to entitle him now to compensation at its hands, for the injury, from the Durbar. XI. It is, in the opinion of the Commission, quite possible that the com plainant's arm was previously broken or seriously injured, and that the rough treatment to which he was probably subjected aggravated such injurv, but his statement, as it stands, does not appear to it to be altogether credible 'under the circumstances. XII. It seems to be proper, before closing these remarks, that the Com mission should record its opinion that the Durbar's explanation of its denial, in its yad of 15th August 1872, of the complainant's imprisonment by it, is not satisfactory, and when considered with what appears to have been, so far as can be judged, an attempt to impose on the Commission by a false entry in the Police Station Register, and some other instances that have come to notice, that there is grave ground for the doubts expressed by the Resident as to the trust worthiness of the Durbar's statements and documents in matters in which it has an interest in suppressing the facts. «SCHEDULE No. 1. Case No. 5. Natkuva Tislo, resident of tlie Rewa Kanta. This case is referred to by tlie Resident in Ms correspondence with, the Bombay Government, viz ;— Letter No. 144—756, dated 18th August 1873 (paras. 2 and 3), and is one of the three cases whose thorough investigation by the Commission is specially ordered in para, 5 of letter from the Government of India to the Government of Bombay, No. 2209-p,dated 29th September 1873. 1. The circumstances of this case, as brought forward by the Resident, are set forth in the Schedule, and in the Resident's letter dated 31st December 1873, which will be found in the file of the case. 2. Owing to the non-attendance of the complainant from alleged sickness as deposed to by his father Tislo Govinda, and one Shankar Laldas, the Commis sion has been unable to enquire into his grievance, which consists (1) of his having been unjustly seized and sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment on the alleged offence of defiling a shrine of Mahadeo near A.tarsumba, the Head Quarters of one of the Gaekwar's Mahals, and (2) of the Vahivatdar's having extorted certain sums from himself and his father for his release, notwithstanding the payment of which the complainant was again irregularly apprehended and sent to Baroda, where a further sum was demanded from him, and though its payment was arranged for by his father, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years, and remained in jail till released at the instance of the Resident. 3. The Durbar Agent's review of this case will be found in the file. It appears from it that the complainant was charged with entering the temple dis guised and thereby—he being a chumar—defiling the shrine, and that he was sen tenced to rigorous imprisonment for 7 years by the Maharaja s orders after consideration of the circumstances as reported by the Vahivatdar. 4. The Resident challenges the correctness of the Durbar s statement of the case on all the important points at issue, in his dated 31st'Decem ber 1873. General Observations and Opinion of the Commission. I. In the absence* of the principal in this case the Commission is not in a . . position to pass a trustworthy judgment as * N ote . At the request of the Commission r merits, but as it is one of the cases enquiries were made by the Resident as to l;(J ' ^-P T-^rlio 'ho the possibility of the complainant's coming ordered by the Government of India to be to Baroda to state his case, but no further thorougTily invGstigated, it deexns it right information Las been obtained on this point. ^ recorc | following remarks ou it:— II. As regards the alleged grounds on which the complainant was origi nally seized, the Commission has no doubt that he must have been, to some extent at least, guilty of the offence charged against him, as it is quite unable to con ceive that such a procedure would be taken absolutely without cause towards a man in his position, merely with the object of extorting money from bis tat ler, who did not even reside within the Gaekwar's jurisdiction. a —5 1TTT Tinder this view of tlie case the Durbar appears to have been fully justified in Apprehending and P— KrtS 'o^STZ C^Lrt—ed in its proceeding on trfS thar/e sentence was nnnecessarily severe, and mdacative of an intolerant spirit on the part of the Chief or the Durbar. i • t , his father if/thf vth 'ff ^ a sion thinks it not improbable that he would have endeavoured to a-. uj e rans- fOT of his complaint from the Residency to the Durbar. Assuming however, that the money was demanded and paid as stated, it would appear that it was so, without the knowledge of the^Durbar, to obtain the release of the prisoner 1 bail pending the receipt of orders on the case from Baroda, to which place the circumstances seem to have been reported, as the subsequent re-apprehension and despatch of the complainant there, were clearly made under orders from the Durbar. V. As regards the alleged further demand of Ks. 300 made for the release of complainant after being imprisoned at Baroda, and for which his father states he made arrangements, there is nothing to shew that the Durbar was m any way cognizant of, or concerned in, the circumstance, and the fair inference is that it was not so. VI. On a full consideration of the circumstances as thus glanced at, the Commission is not prepared to condemn the Durbar's proceedings in treating the complainant as an offGnder on tlie ground stated by it ? and it considers tliat it was competent to punish him, if the crime with which he stood charged was proved to its satisfaction. The sentence passed on him was, however, altogether excessive, and severe beyond all reason. There is nothing to shew that the Dur bar was in any way a party to the alleged extortion of money by its local officials in this case, and it should, in the opinion of the Commission, be enabled to enquire into the allegations on that head by the attendance for the purpose, under special arrangements by the Resident, of the complainant and his witnesses, when, if proved, the refund of the money and the punishment of the delinquents would doubtless be secured. The alleged irregular apprehension of the complainant within the jurisdiction of the Mahi Kanta Agency, and his being taken into the Baroda territory and there dealt with as described, appears to the Commission to be a matter for enquiry by the Political Agent, who is fully competent to dispose of such a case. It is, however, to be observed that the man appears to have accompanied his bail, a private individual, across the frontier of his own accord and free will, and that there is no mention of any Durbar official having been concerned in the con currence.SCHEDULE 1. Case No. 9. Complaint of Maneklal Vithal, Groldsmitli of Ahraedabad. The case of this complainant is referred to by the Resident in his letter to the Bombay Government No. 144-750, dated 18th August 1873, (para. 4,) and is one of those whose thorough investigation by the Commission, is ordered in letter from the Government of India to the Government of Bombay No. 2209 p., dated 29th September 1873, (para. 5). 1. The complainant's grievance is that, when atBaroda, some ten months ago, about February 1873, he was falsely accused by his cousin one Amratlal, who lives there, of having written to his brother at Ahmedabad that the said Amrutlal's daughter, Ganga, had gone to the Maharaja, and that he, (Amrutlal) would be turned out of caste. Amrutlal brought ten or twelve witnesses to prove his statement. Complainant was asked if he had written the letter, and denied having done so. He was induced to show his handwriting, and gave a speci men of it. A few days later he was informed that he had been sentenced to fourteen year's imprisonment, and was taken to jail. After being four or four and a half months in jail, he was released at the instance of the Resident. He declares that he never wrote the letter which formed the ground of the charge against him. 2. The original proceedings and other papers connected with the complain ant's trial and his case, are produced by the Resident, to whom they were furnish ed by the Durbar, and it appears from them that the sentence passed on him was one and not fourteen years' imprisonment. Amongst the papers is one pur porting to be a confession of the complainant of his having written the letter in question bearing his signature, which he alleges to be a forgery. The Com mission, however, after a careful comparison of this with his other signature, is not at all satisfied that it is so, and is, on the contrary, rather of opinion that it is genuine. 3. The Durbar Agent urges that the complainant has no claim to the protection of the British authorities as a British subject, and states that he is a subject of Baroda, as can be proved from a reference to the census papers ol 1872, and from his having paid the assessment on his house at Baroda, as well as by other evidence. He adds that the depositions of the witnesses were taken in complainant's presence, and that the signature he denies was his, and was made by him voluntarily. The sentence passed on him was one year's imprisonment, and to find security of Rs. 200 not to repeat the offence. 4. The Resident, in his final remarks on this case, dated 2nd January 1874, questions the genuineness and trustworthiness of the original proceedings in it produced by the Durbar as having been held by it, and urges that the com plainant is entitled to protection and redress as a ' British subject,' and that whether he be the latter or not, he is still entitled to the protection of the British Government against the oppressive action of the Durbar Court. General Observations and Opinion of the Commission. I. The Commission has given full consideration to the complainant's state ment and the observations of the Durbar Agent and the Resident respectively, in this case, and as it is clearly of opinion that there is no sufficient ground for its a —9 12 interference in the matter at all, unless the complainant is clearly entitled to protection as a British subject, it has deemed it necessary to form its own judg ment on that point in the first instance. II It appears from the Durbar Agent's statement and the complainant's own admission before the Commission, that the latter's grandfather and father were subjects of, and in the service of 3 the Baroda State, and that the complain- ant himself was born at, and resided in Baroda till he was 4 or 5 years of age. He then went to live at Ahmedabad with his mother, but retained his father's house at Baroda, and has continued to pay the customary rates for it and to occupy it whenever he has revisited the place, which, by his own account, he has been in the habit of doing for a few months at a time, though his chief and permanent residence has been at Ahmedabad. III. Under these circumstances, it appears to the Commission that the Durbar was justified in regarding the complainant as being amenable to its laws for any offence committed against them, and for which he might be apprehended while within Baroda limits ; and it is unable to call in question its full power and authority to act in accordance with that view. IV. 'With respect to the offence with which complainant was charged and the sentence passed on him, the proceedings of the case, furnished by the Durbar, cannot, in the judgment of the Commission, be called in question by it, and it could not, it considers, with propriety, under such circumstances, proceed to a re investigation of the charge on which the complainant has been condemned. V. The sentence of one year's imprisonment and the demand of Rs. 200 security not to repeat the offence, recorded in those proceedings, though doubt less severe, are not so excessive in a case of this nature, as in the opinion of the Commission, to call for any special interference on its part in the complainant's favour; but it will be quite proper for the Resident to request the Durbar to send the complainant to his office when the term of his sentence has expired.SCHEDULE 1. Case No. 10. Complaint of ParKhudas Parsliotani, resident of Nariad, Ivai ra district, a British subject. Complainant's grievance consists of his having, when residing with his uncle (with whom he had been for four or five months) in the Patan Mahal, been seized on a charge of theft, and taken by the Foujdar to the Thana, where he was tied up with his hands behind his back and told to confess by the Karkun. He was thus treated on the morning and evening of two days ; and on the evening of the second day, was struck four times with a tamarind stick, when he became faint, and was released and allowed to go home. Complainant adds that the case has been inquired into by the Durbar, and that he only wants to have justice done to him, and to be allowed to return to his house. 2. The Durbar Agent states that a preliminary enquiry has been already held in this, ^ and some other similar cases, against the Foujdar Fatteh 'Ram, that they consider the charges preferred against him to be proved, and that he is now awaiting sentence, the punishment to be awarded to him being under consi deration. 3. From the Resident's final statement in this case, dated 2nd January 1874, it appears that the Foujdar who committed the offence, has been punished (the Commission was verbally informed before leaving Baroda, that he had been re moved from office and sentenced to two years' imprisonment,) and Rs. 28 have been given to the complainant as compensation for the ill-treatment he received. Opinion op the Commission. The Commission is of opinion that the punishment of the Foujdar is suitable, but that it will be further proper to inform the Durbar that he should not be re-employed in its service, in any similar capacity. The compensation paid to the complainant appears to be insufficient, and should not have been less than Rs. KM at the lowest, which sum might with propriety, have been levied from the Foujdar as a fine. Z a —10 icna) SCHEDULE No. 1. Cases 12 and 13, Complaints of Narangi, wife of Yithoba, and Salu, wife of Ghanu, residents formerly of Khanwal and Sakarpa respectively, in the Ratnagiri District. The case of these complainants is not referred to by the Resident in any of his letters to Government, and appears only to have come to his knowledge shortly before the Commission left Baroda. The women in both cases are British subjects having, until they came to Baroda, a little more than two years ago, always resided in the Katnagiri Collectorate. Their case, therefore, is classed under Schedule I amongst those referred to by the Government of India in para. 5 of their letter to the Government of Bombay, No. 2209- p , dated 29th September 1873, though it is not clear that it altogether talis within the scope and intention of that paragraph. 1. The first complainant's grievance is as follows :—She states that about 2^ years ago she was enticed away from her husband's house in the Ratnagiri Collectorate by some servants of Nana Sahib, His Highness the Gaekwar's minister, who, it should be mentioned, is a native of that part of the country ; that on arrival at Baroda, she went to live with Nana Sahib as his mistress ; that after some time she went voluntarily to serve in the Hani's palace, but the duties were distasteful to her; that after serving for four or five months in the palace, she was confined in the Chabutra, or lock-up, for 1 -g months, and subsequent ly for l-g years in jail, because she did not, in answer to the Gaekwars question, give any information relative to an intrigue between the Raholkar and the Rani; that when in jail she was twice flogged for some petty offence, receiving four cuts on the back from a cane, other women also having been flogged in her presence; and finally, that on the occasion of the last eclipse of the moon in November, she was unconditionally released, since which time she has obtained her living by grinding corn and other daily labour. 2 The second complainant's grievance is as follows ; She states that she was seduced from her home by some servants of Nana Sahib the minister, who pro mising her jewels and clothes induced her to leave her mother s house that on arriving at Baroda she went to live with Nana Sahib as his wife, when the child she was carrying in her arms, when examined by the Commission, was begotten; that some little time after, she was taken by Nana Sahib to the palace, and forced against her will to become a ' Loundi' or domestic slave under the orders of the Rani, that after serving about five months, she was sent first to the ' chabutra or lock-up, where she was confined for 1^ months, and subsequently to the jail, where she was confined for 1| years, presumably because she could not or would not answer satisfactorily questions put to her by the Graekwar relative to an alleged intrigue between one Balvantrao Raholkar, and the wife of His Highness ; that when in jail she was once flogged, receiving four cuts on the back from a cane for some petty offence, and that on two or three occasions, other women had been flogged in like manner in her presence ; and finally, that she had been released from prison unconditionally and not compelled to return to serve as a 'Loundi,' on the occasion of the eclipse in November last, since when she had obtained her living by grinding corn and daily labour. 3. The Durbar Agents state that these women were not seduced from their homes as they allege, but came to Baroda of their own accord in search of employment; that they applied to Nana Sahib, the minister, who engaged them for service in the Rani's palace where they received food and clothing, and were otherwise well treated ; that when in service, they were guilty of theft and were on this account sent to prison, from which they were released on the occasion of a—12 12 the eclipse in November last as an act of clemency. As regards the alleged flogging of the complainants while in jail, the Durbar Agents state that no com plaint was ever made to the Durbar on the subject; that the practice of flogging women in jail, if it exists, is contrary to the orders in force, and that enquiries will be at once instituted to ascertain if such is the case. Complainant No. 13, while in jail, was allowed milk and extra rations, in consequence of having given birth to a child while imprisoned. 4. The Resident's remarks on the case of the complainants will be found in his final Statement on the seizure of respectable women to serve as ' Loundis' in the palace, appended to the file of that case. Schedule II., No. 40. General Observations and Opinion or the Commission. I. The Commission has given due consideration to the Resident's views on these cases, but finds itself unable to adopt them in the manner desired by him. II. If the tale of the complainants is true, it is clear that they came to Baroda entirely of their own accord, and that they have absolutely no case on that score calling for redress at the hands of the Commission. It is, however, quite within the Resident's power to have their case brought to the notice of the Magistrate of Ratnagiri, who can, at the instance of their husbands, if they desire it, deal with the enticement of these women from their homes as an offence un der the Penal Code. III. With regard to the allegation of the 2nd complainant of enforced service as a Loundi at the palace, her bare statement of the fact can hardly, under the circumstances, be accepted as proof of any compulsion having been used towards her in the matter, while the first complainant states that she went volun tarily to serve in the palace. vfj- ^ ext ' . witl1 ^erence to the imprisonment of the complainants, and the different versions of the grounds therefor given by them, and the Durbar : gents, the Gommission deems it unnecessary for it to enter into anv further f 0 i b:ieCt 0f elicitin g tlle facte - Such a course could not possibly lead to any conclusive or satisfactory results, and the release of the complainants two months ago makes it now needless. t ^ a pp e ars to the Commission that if these women were reallv Native Chiefs thev ^ t™*!! 0rdinaril y ^garded in the households of .Native Ohiets, they would never have been sent to jail for such offences as those stated by themselves and the Durbar Agent and afLwardr^LaT^ absolutelv mlaJitsdr^e oZ' b - Ut ' WOUld ^ pmAhed within the limits of the Loundis in the sense of rmertiosZet C0I1Sider ^ Were ^SCHEDULE II. Case No. 1. Grievances of the Sardars and Military classes of the Bare da State. The grievances of these classes were referred to by the Resident in his cor respondence with the Bombay Government as follows (1). Letter No. 103—652, dated 25th June 1373 (para. 6 and translation of petition enclosed), (2). Letter No. 107—573, dated 28th June 1873 (paras. 3 to 6). (3). Letter No. 146—762, dated 19th August 1873 (paras. 2 to 8 inclusive). SUMMARY of the Complaints of the Sardars Military Classes, Opinion of the Commission I.—The complainants in the Cases No. 1 to 6 (the Pandare and Ghorpare Sardars) have no personal grievance. Their pay is in arrears for the past two years, owing to their refusal to receive it, in consequence of the reduction of certain of the lesser Silledars, for whose permanent maintenance by the Gaekwar they allege they had received guarantees at the request of the late Gaekwar at Kapura in 1858. II.—The complainants in the six cases noted in the margin, 26, 27,28, hayg had their grievances against the present Gaekwar . an ' adjusted, and state that they have now no complaints to make. III.—Of the remaining 28 cases of grievance that have been preferred be fore the Commission, the following, eleven in number—Nos. 7, 8, 9, 22, 23, 25, 29, 32, 33, 39, 40—-originated altogether in the time of the late and previous Gaekwars, and any complaints in connection therewith against the present Chief have been adjusted by him, and are withdrawn. No. 7 complains that he was deprived by the late Chief of the management of the pargana of Saoli, which he claims to have held in Jaghir. The Durbar asserts that his tenure of the pargana was a mere yearly lease, with an assign ment of a fixed portion of its revenues as part of his service allowances, and adds that on resumption of the pargana a special grant of Rs. 10,000 annually was made to him in lieu of the said management. The perusal of the so called Sanads produced by the complainant appears to the Commission to support the Durbar's explanation of the nature of the terms on which the management of the pargana was originally assigned to him in 1818, and subsequently renewed, as shown in a similar grant of 1835 produced by the complainant. The Commission does not feel called on to record an opinion on the proceed ings complained of. No. 8 has made contradictory statements, which leave it doubtful how his case really stands ; but his grievances, such as they are, date from the reign of the late Gaekwar, who, so far as the Commission can form an opinion on a case, which is stated to have occurred eleven years ago, appears to have acted towards him in a harsh and arbitrary manner, though quite in accordance with the then existing and previous practice on the point in force in the State. The complain ant admits that the present Chief has restored to him a village of the annual value of Rs. 14,000, which formed part of the property alleged to have been confiscated by his predecessor. a —1 i2*' No.' 9 complains 'ttat i reduction of 25 sowars, and the resumption ot 3 villages aid the management of the Kheiralu Pargana enforced a,gainBt Mm by the late Graekwar in 1868, but admits that a cash grant of Rs. 10,000 unnuaUy was made to him in lieu of the said pargana which is still continued to him, together with cash allowances to the amount of Rs. 67,000 annua y. He adds that these allowances are in arrears for two years, owing to his refusal to receive them on the same ground as that assigned by JNo. 1 to b. The case does not appear to be one calling for the record of an opinion from the Commission. No. -22.—The complaint in this case is against the action of the late and preceding Gaekwars, who in 1854 and 1867 confiscated 2 Inam Villages, annual value R s * 10,000 4 Establishment of Karkuns, &amp;c 22,900 Pagah of Sowars — &gt;» 30,000 Personal, Palki, &amp;c., allowances j, 60,000 Total Rs. 1,22,900 the property of the complainant. The proceeding of the late Graekwar, Khanderao, was taken on the ground of his quitting the Baroda State, and proceeding to Jodhpore without permission. The present Chief has done nothing towards restoring the above, and has con tinued a prohibition forbidding complainant to visit the city of Baroda issued by his predecessor. Complainant's grievance consists in the present Gaekwar's refusing to; comply with his requests on these points, and the Commission does not feel called upon to record an opinion on his case. ■ complaint in this case is against the action of the late Gaek- wav, who in 1868 reduced 2 sowars and 65 footmen, with cash allowances aggre gating Es. 8,700 annually, from the establishment previously held by complainant, leavinsr him only 4 sowars, and the remainder of his annual allowance amounting to Rs. 5,000. , Complainant's claim consists of a demand for the restoration of the above; and no opinion appears to be called for from the Commission regarding it. No. 25.—The complaint in this case is,—Isf, against the action of the late Gaekwar, who in 1860 reduced 2 sowars, for whom complainant received Rs. 300 annually; 2nd, Rs. 537 out of Rs. 837 personal allowance, which he had also previously enjoyed, was stopped by the present Gaekwar, but it has recently been restored to the complainant, whose only grievance now is that the sowars reduced in 1860 have not also been given back to him. The case does not call for an opinion from the Commission. ; No. 29. The complaint in this case is against the action of Ganpatrao (xaek vvar, who in 1855 reduced complainant's personal allowance of Rs. 3,300 annually by Rs. 1,500, leaving him only Rs. 1,800, which he still enjoys. He has no grievance against the present Chief. No opinion appears to be called for in this case. No. o2.~The complaint in this case is,—Is^, against the action of the late Gaekwar who m 1860 reduced complainant's establishment of 30 footmen and Rs. 8,000 annual cash allowance by 10 footmen and Rs. 825 cash allowance; and 'n, against tie appointment of a JVIahratta Darogah a year aco to supervise his remaining establishment, but who has recently been withdrawn. Complain ant s grievance now consists only of the reduction under Head 1., which he claims to have restored to him. No opinion appears to be called for in this case. f^plrw*; ^ejcomplaint is,—Is^, against the action of the late Gaekwar, who m 1866 resumed an Inam village valued at Rs. 200, in lieu ofwhich he assigned complainant a cash allowance of Rs. 225 annually ; and 2nd against the present Chief, who reduced 8 of his pagah of 32 horses in 1872, but who has recently restored the same. The grievance in this case has now reference solely to the resumption of the Inam village by the late Chief, regarding which no opinion appears to be called for from the Oommisson. No. 39.—In this case the complaint is,— against the action of the late Gaekwar, who in 1868 resumed an Inam village worth to complainant Rs. 478 annually ; and 'Ind, against the present Chief, who in 1870 reduced 4 of his pagah of 29 horses. Complainant's original allowances aggregated Us. 12,037 annu ally, which he now enjoys in full; the 4 horses reduced, having been recently re stored to him. He has no grievance except the resumption of the village by the late Chief, regarding which no opinion from the Commission appears necessary. No. 40.—In this case the complaint is—Isi, the reduction in 1866 by the late Gaekwar of Rs. 542 from his personal cash allowance of Rs. 2,642; and the further reduction in 1871 by the present Chief of Rs. 1,500, leaving him only a balance of Rs. 600. The present Chief having recently restored the Rs. 1,500 reduced by him, complainant has now no grievance against him, but claims the restoration of the previous reduction of Rs. 542, regarding which the opinion of the Commission does not appear to be called for. IV.—The remaining 17 cases, viz., Nos. 11,12, 13,14, 15,16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38,—more or less affect the present Chief, and are summa rized as follows :— No. 11.—In this case complainant states that he had a Tahinat, (establish ment), of 100 sowars and 10 footmen; that he received Rs. 14,000 annually for the former, and Palki allowance, &amp;c., and a special personal allowance of Rs. 1,200 annually for good service. He does not state his receipts for the footmen. The whole of the above was reduced in 1870 by the present Gaekwar without/ he alleges, any assigned reason, and he has since been left absolutely penniless. The Durbar simply states that it has no confidence in the complainant, and h^s, there fore, dismissed him. V' The complainant in this case is an Arab, and one of a class not unlikely to give trouble if dealt with inconsiderately or unjustly ; and in the absence of any definite cause for his dismissal from employment, the Durbar's proceedings towards him appear to the Commission to have been arbitrary and imprudent. No. 12.—In this case the complaint is that the present Chief in 1871 deprived the complainant of his pagah of 10 sowars and annual cash allowance of Rs. 5,800 without any reason therefor, leaving him, as in the previous case, penniless. The Durbar again, in this instance, simply states that it has no confidence in him, and has, therefore, dismissed him. The Commission is of opinion that the proceeding adopted towards the com plainant as above was, so far as it can judge, arbitrary and imprudent. No. 13.—In this case complainant held a charge of 25 footmen, for which he received Rs. 3,000 annually. He also had charge of a levy of 200 men in the Okamandal Mahal. Of the former charge, 4 men were reduced by the order of the late Gaekwar, and the remaining 21 during the current year by the present Chief, without any assigned reason. The charge of the levy was taken from complainant on the accession of the present Gaekwar in 1870, and given to some one else. The Durbar admits the correctness of the above statement, and asserts that the restoration of the establishment of 21 footmen to complainant had been ordered. It denies that he has any claim to the restoration of the charge of the levy of 200 men in Okamandal. fc—i-t-i x- r fim 9i footmen leaving complainant, a Mekrani, who ^nt^doneletl 'ervt to Okamanlj, p/nnile^, seems to the Com -led out man ^ ^ majy — - = 'Sen w?th ^r P d to the levy does not call for an opinion from the Oom- mission. ■ of horse; with an annu al cash allowance of t&gt; ,4 nis an d an Inam village valued at Es. 10,000 annually, was held by one Mahadavrao, who was killed J death ^his ^^o^ adopted^he^sald ^XrSLnTbrother the complainant in this case, who states that the T )nrl« his abolished the uigah, resumed the cash allowance and I nam vdlage, ® d sMzed all the State and Sther property held by the deceased Mahadavrao. The Durbar denies the validity of the adoption alleging that, according to Hindu law an adopted son could neither himself adopt his own natural brother to succeed' him, nir could his widow do so subsequent to his demise, and it states that the adoption was never sanctioned, and that the complainant is not Swffnized as having any claim to the succession in this case It further Tserts that the private property of the estate h.3 only been attached, pending a decision as to the heirship thereto. This case is not one on which the Commission feels called on to pronounce an opinion. No 15 —In this case a pagah of sowars, with an annual cash allowance of Es. 85,000 and a share in an Inam village valued at about fts- 2,200 was held by one Radii an Mia, whodied in 1872. The complainant claims to be Radhan Mias adopted son, and complains that the Durbar has abolished the pagah, and resum ed the cash allowances ; the Inam village having been resumed by the late Oraek- war in 1868; and has also seized the horses and private property belonging to the estate of the deceased. The Durbar points out that adoption is not recognized amongst the Mahomed- ans, and that it has declined to admit it in this case, though a Nazarana of one lakh of Rupees has been offered by the Complainant to induce it to do so. It states that an allowance of Rs. 200 per mensem has, however, been granted to him for his subsistence, and denies that it has interfered at all with the deceased Eadhan Mia's private property. . 1 The Commission does not feel called on to record any opinion on the merits of this case. No. 16.—In this case a village of the annual value of Rs. 4,000 and an annual cash allowance of Rs. 1,600 were granted to one Jelaji by the late Gaek- war, as a reward for his instructing the Chief in gymnastics. About the time of the accession of the present Gaekwar Jelaji died, and the village and allowances were at once resumed, and the deceased's property, valued at Rs. 55,000, was con fiscated. The deceased left two widows, one of whom has since died ; and a claim is put forth by his father-in-law, a pensioned Silledar, on behalf of the survivor, to the property thus resumed and confiscated. The Durbar states that a compassionate allowance of Rs. 25 per mensem was made for six months to each of the widows, and that the private property was only attached, pending a decision as to the heirship thereto. The Commission does not feel called on to record an opinion on the merits of this case, which does not appear to belong to the class of cases under immedi ate inquiry, v No. 17.—In this case the complainant was in possession of 2 Inam villages of the annual value of Rs. 8,000, and an annual cash allowance of Rs. 30,000, )which he held with a pagah of horse. The whole management of the above was trans ferred in 1865 to the complainant's mother by the late Gaekwar, but was restoredto him by the present Chief after his accession. At the end of six months how ever, the management was again taken from him, and given over by the Durbar to complainant's mother, with whom it still remains, a monthly allowance of Es 125 and a horse being assigned to the complainant. The Durbar admits the above to be correct, and states that the arrangement so described was made by it, in consequence of the complainant being unfit to carry on the duties of Pagadar. The Commission does not feel called on to record any opinion on the merits of this case. No. 18.—In this case complainant, who was the son-in-law of Maharaja Seiajirao, held a pagah of sowars with an annual cash allowance therefor of Rs. 22,000 and Rs. 2,000 personal allowance, and an Inam village of the value of Rs, 5,000, the same having been assigned to him by Seiajirao,'bn^lTis marriage with his daughter in 1836. In 1858 the pagah, with the pagah and personal cash allowances, was transferred to his two sons by the then Gaekwar, Khanderao, who added a further sum of Rs 2,000 to the younger son, and complainant was made Subah of Deesa, with an annual cash allowance of Rs. 29,800. On the accession of the present Gaekwar, complainant states he was deprived of the office of Subah, and the cash allowance of Rs. 29,800, and the Inam village alone was left to him. The pagah with the aggregate cash allowances of Rs. 26,000 as shown above, which had been transferred to his sons, was also resumed, and the Durbar seized 6 horses, houses, and other private property belonging to him to the amount of Rs. 55,000. The Durbar admits the truth of the complaint, but states that the complain ant's wife, on whose account the grants were made to him, having died, it was at liberty to resume the said grants; and that as complainant, when in power, adopted the same course towards the present Graekwar's father-in-law, it saw no good reason for leaving him in possession of the grants that have been resumed, though he has not been disturbed in that of the village. With regard to the seizure of the horses and other property, the former were taken in lieu of State horses, which complainant had not restored; the houses were Govern ment, and not private property, and complainant still owes Rs. 15,000 to the State. Nos. 19 and 20.—The complainants in these cases are sons of the complain ant in No. 18. They state that the pagah with a cash allowance of Rs. 24,000 which was transferred to them from their father by the late Gaekwar, and Rs. 2,000, additional grant to the younger of them in 1858, was resumed by the present Gaekwar on his accession, and that they are left without means of subsistence. The Durbar observes that the custom of the State fully warranted the re sumption in these cases, and that it does not admit that either the father or the sons have any grievance in the course that has been taken in the matter. It appears to the Commission that the summary resumption by the present Gaekwar of the employment and allowances granted to the first complainant (his own brother-in-law) by Maharaja Seiajirao 35 years previously, and continued to him and his sons, as described by them, by the two succeeding Chiefs, however warranted by the custom of the State, was a harsh measure, dictated apparently by personal animosity on the part of the Chief. No. 21.—In this case the complainant is the representative of one of the old State bankers. His grievances are of two kinds,— the resumption by the present Chief of a pagah of 62 horses and 10 footmen, which had been granted to the firm with 3 Inam villages, and cash allowances for the maintenance of the above establishment, 2 palkis, &amp;c., &amp;c.,— all of the aggregate amount of Rs. 35,000—by Maharaja Govindrao about 100 years ago, and his successors up to the late Khanderao Gaekwar's time ; 2qc?, the seizure by the Durbar, about 15 months ago, of the private property of the firm, and its refusal to aid the latter, aswan always customary, in realizing its jurt dues from the Sardars and Saiedars, by whom fifteen lakhs are owing to the firm Tn the matter of the first grievance, the whole of the cash allowances and T llao-es for which complainant produces Sanads, admitted by the Durbar a S to be genuine, assigning the same to him in perpetuity so long as the firm f rined to be servants of the State, were summarily resumed by the present Thief about 15 months ago; the pagah and footmen being taken over by the State the horses of the pagah, (which was serving m the contingent m Kattywar), which were the private property of the firm, together with all their equipments of the afforeo-ate value of about Rs. 12,000, being at the same time confiscated. The reason assigned by the Durbar to complainant for the above proceeding was a claim preferred by it against the firm for debts due to the State, which complainant alleges to be unfounded. The second grievance, being one connected wholly with the position of the firm as a State banker, will be dealt with separately under another head. The Durbar states that it denies the right of the firm to hold the pagah in perpetuity ; and that as Motilal, the late head of the firm, who died about two months' ago, left Baroda about fifteen months ago, without the Gaekwar's per mission, it considers it had a right to resume the pagah. The Durbar admits that the horses were the private property of the firm, but asserts that when they were confiscated they were believed to belong to the State. It adds that they shall be restored on the adjustment of accounts between the State and the firm. On a full consideration of the circumstances of this case, the Commission is of opinion that the proceedings of the Durbar towards the complainant in the summary attachment of his establishment, and the resumption of his cash allow ances and Inam villages on the grounds stated, were harsh and arbitrary, and calculated to excite alarm amongst the old employes of the State, who held simi lar charges under grants from previous Gaekwars. No. 24.—In this case the complainant held a pagah of 13 horses, which had been conferred on his grandfather by Maharaja Anandrao many years ago, with cash allowance of Rs. 7,800 and an-Inam village worth Rs. 440. His great-grand father previously enjoyed another Inam village of the annual value of Rs. 1,000, In 1868 the late Gaekwar resumed the village worth Rs. 440, and in 1870 his cash allowances were stopped by the present Chief. In July of the present year the 13 horses composing his pagah, which were his private property, were con fiscated by the Durbar. Within the last two months the pagah establishment and horses with the cash, allowance have been restored to complainant with the arrears due therefor, and his only grievance now is that the Inam village resumed by the late Gaekwar has not also been restored to him. The Durbar Agent observes that the village was held by complainant in part payment of his allowances, and that on its resumption he received in cash 'the equivalent at which it had been originally assigned. The Commission does not feel called upon to record any opinion on the case. No, 30.—In this case the complainant, an Arab Sardar, held a pagah of 36 sowars and an establishment of 7 2' footmen, which had been granted to his father many years ago, with cash and personal allowances of Rs. 8,085 for the former, and Rs. 9,672 for the latter. In 187l;; the present Gaekwar took from com plainant the pagah of horse with the cash allowance assigned therefor, and per sonal allowance, and transferred the same to Eshvantrao, a, relative of Hariba Gaekwar, the Revenue Commissioner; and in 1872 he resumed the establishment of footmen with the allowance fixed for it. Complainant states that the charge of the establishment of footmen has been recently restored to him, but the pagah has not been, and his grievance is now confined to 'the latter point. , 'p le durbar Agent remarks that the establishment both of Horse and Foot held by complainant was resumed by the late Gaekwar in 1861, but the nominal G 67 charge remained in his name, and was still held by him, a personal cash allowance of Rs. 1,200 annually being assigned to him. On the present Chief's accession the case was enquired into, and the pagah was transferred to another person. The foot establishment with allowances fixed at Rs. 10,000 annually has been re- granted to complainant, and he is now in possession of it. The action of the Durbar in this case, so far as the Commission is in a posi tion to judge, was summary and imprudent, considering that the complainant, an Arab leader, was one of a class likely to cause trouble, if inconsiderately dealt with. It is also worthy of note that the pagah of which complainant was de prived was not in this instance reduced, but was transferred to another person. No. 35.—In this case complainant who was an adopted son succeeded his father in the possession of a pagah of 25 horse, and a cash allowance aggre gating Rs. 11,350. His father had enjoyed a cash allowance of Hs. 82,250, of which, on his death in 1861, Rs. 20,900 was resumed by the late Gaekwar on the ground that his successor was an adopted sou. In 1869 on the death of complainant's adoptive mother, her private property, to the value of one lakh of Rupees, was attached by the late Gaekwar, and the present Chief in 1872 con fiscated the same to the State, and at the same time reduced complainant's cash allowances by Rs. 1,900. Orders have recently been issued for the restora tion of the latter to complainant, whose only grievance now consists of the seizure and confiscation of his mother's estate to which he was the heir, and the restoration of which he claims at the hands of the Gaekwar. The Durbar admits that the property was placed under attachment for the benefit of complainant, who is still a minor, and that a portion of it valued at half a lakh of Rupees, but which only realised Rs. 35,000 on sale, was retained by it as Nazarana. It further alleges that the remainder was made over to complainant's grandmother who is now his guardian, a receipt for the entire estate, including the portion reserved as Nazarana, being however taken from her. The Commission does not feel called on to record an opinion on the merits of this grievance, but remarks that the complainant appears to it to have long passed the years of minority. No. 36.—In this case the complainant who was adopted by one Narayenrao, son-in-law of the late Gaekwar Khanderao, on the day of his death, and was re cognized and acknowledged to have been so by the Durbar in the usual manner, states that his father enjoyed— \st. —A pagah of 100 horse with a cash allowance of... Rs, 31,080 2nd. —A personal allowance of ,, 12,000 3 &gt; d.—Allowance as Killedar with ten Government horses „ 4,000 4£/i.—An Establishment with cash allowance including value of two Inam villages ... ..... „ 13,288 5th. —An additional Inam village of the value of „ 18,000 ' Total Rs. ... 78*368 Item No. 4 of the above was resumed by the late Gaekwar in 1868, but Narayenrao remained in the enjoyment of the remainder during his lifetime. 1: On his adoption being recognized, the sum of 3 lakhs of Rupees Nazarana was fixed by the Durbar, and agreed to by him to be paid therefor. The tran saction was not, however, completed, as Hariba Dada, the Revenue Commissioner, required the surrender to him of the Inam village (No. 6 in the above list) valued at Rs. 18,000, which was refused by the complainant, but subsequently agreed to by his grandmother, together with the surrender of a garden and bungalow at Baroda, the private property of his father, of the value of 2 lakhs of Rupees. Complainant resisted this arrangement, and was then deprived of tlte post of Killedar with the allowance of Rs. 4,000, the pagah of 100 horse with theallowance of Es. 31,080 attached thereto, and the personal allowance of Rs. 12,000 being alone left to him. With the Inam village shown above as No. 5, private property of the value of 2^ lakhs, consisting of houses, stables, garden, &amp;c., was also seized and con fiscated. Complainant states he was willing to give any reasonable amount as Nazarana. The Durbar does not question the general correctness of complainant's state ments and merely remarks that at the time of recognition of his adoption, it per mitted him to retain such portion of his predecessor's estate as it chose, and resumed the rest. •fThe Commission is of opinion that the action of the Durbar in this case was of an inconsiderate and arbitrary character, considering that the adoption of the complainant as the son and representative of the son-in-law of a previous Gaekwar was formally recognized by it, though the course taken in this matter was pro bably not unsupported by precedent and the practice on previous occasions. No. 37.—In this case complainant, who was an adopted son, succeeded to the possession of an establishment of 6 horse with an annual cash allowance of Rs. 1,932, which he enjoyed from 1844 to March in the current year, when the same was transferred to his cousin, who paid a Nazarana therefor of Rs. 4,000 to the State, and Rs. 600 as a personal gratification to the present Minister, Nana Sahib. Complainant, who was serving with his establishment in the Contingent at Sadra in the Mahi Kanta, on hearing of the transfer came to Baroda and appealed to the Minister, who told him that the establishment should be re-trans ferred to him if he paid a Nazarana of Rs. 5,000, which he refused to do, and the establishment has remained with his cousin. Complainant then represented his case to the Pandare Sardars. The Durbar admits the transfer of the establishment, as stated by the com plainant, but remarks that the Nazarana levied therefor was only Rs. 2,000, and that the alleged payment to the minister is untrue. The Commission is of opinion that the proceeding of the Durbar in this case as admitted by it was arbitrary and of a character to cause general alarm to the billeaars, the class of State employes to which complainant belonged. , . ^is case complainant enjoyed a personal allowance of Rs, 1,800, \-u uj granted to him by the two last Gaekwars, and a house in Baroda, which had come to him from his father, to whom it had been granted in perpe- ?! y n ^ ^ aai vi' 1 ] an P a ^ r ao. _ ^ Complainant's father was originally in personal annnal^ 6 011 J who on his marriage made him a personal surlTfr^ 0 n . , W!lS increased in 1854 to Rs, 1,000 by his atthe same ^ gave him the house at xsaroda, and also granted complainant a separate allowance of Rs. 1,000. son ^ Kha-nderao Gaekwar increased the allowances of father and father eniovprl ]i -eaC ll' ein g' ^ ^ leTn as smart soldiers.

From the foregoing summary and the opinion recorded on each case it will seen (1).—That six of the complainants before the Commission have no personal grievance ; their discontent having reference solely to the Durbar's proceedings towards others of their class. (2).—That the grievances of six of the complainants have been adjusted, and that they have withdrawn their complaints. (3).— That the canse of grievance in the cases of eleven of the complainants arose in the time of the late or previous Gaekwars, and that the Commission does not feel called on to record any opinion in ten of the number. In one of these cases—No. 8 on the list—the action complained of appears to have been harsh and arbitrary, though quite in accordance with the then existing practice in the State. (4).—That there are seventeen cases of complaint against the proceedings of the Government since the accession of the present Chiet, six of which do not appear to the Commission to call for an opinion from it. (5).—In the remaining eleven cases the Commission considers that the action taken towards the complainants is open to objection as having been harsh, arbi trary, inconsiderate or imprudent according to the special circumstances of each, though it does not doubt that such action can be justified, in almost each case, by the Durbar, as having been in accordance with precedent and the previous practice of the State. II. The Durbar Agent has furnished the Commission with statements show ing the annual reductions that havebeenmadeby successive Gaekwars during the last sixty years amongst the classes whose grievances form the subject of enquiry by it under this head, in view to proving that such reductions have been conti nued during that period, and that the proceedings of the present Chief in the matter have not involved the introduction of anew system or of novel measures towards these classes. It appears from these statements, of which abstracts are appended—(1) that between Sanvat 1870, ( a.d . 1813-14) and 1926 (1869-70) at the close of which latter year Khanderao Gaekwar died, and the present Chief succeeded to the Gadi, reductions to an aggregate amount of Rs. 10,84,913 were carried out amongst the Sardars and Silledars' classes, or on an average Rs. 19,373 annually ; (2) that during Khanderao's fourteen years' incumbency of the Gadi, from a.d . 1856-57 to 1869-70, the reductions aggregated Rs. 2,66,400, as an average Rs. 19,028 annu ally ; (3) that since the present Chief's accession in November 1870, or three years ago, the reductions made have aggregated Rs. 3,53,958, or on an average Rs. 1,17,986 annually. It is also deserving of notice that of the large amount of reductions so made by the present Chief no less than Rs. 1,93,500 or nearly 55 per cent, are admitted in the statement to have been enforced among the favourites and adherents of the late Gaekwar, Khanderao. The reductions amongst the Sebandi class during the same period were similarly—(1) between Sanvat 1877 ( a.d . 1820-21) and 1926 (1869-70) in the aggregate Rs, 7,69,064, or on an average Rs. ] 5,695 annually; (2) that during Khanderao's fourteen years' incumbency of the Gadi they aggregated Rs. 6,36,575, or on an average Rs. 45,484 annually ; (3) that since the present Chief's accession they have aggregated Rs, 1,15,198, or an average Rs. 38,399 annually. It should also perhaps be mentioned in connection with the reductions car ried out by Khanderao, which were very considerable amongst the Sebandi classes, that the Resident has brought to notice that subsequent to 1858 he largely increased his Military force, and improved its efficiency at a considerable c—1 910 charge, thereby rendering tlie continued maintenance of so large a force of Seban- dis no longer necessary. III.—In his concluding remarks on the subject of the reduction of the Sar- dars and Military classes, the Durbar Agent has alluded to the necessity for the reduction of expenditure in this as well as in other departments of the State ser vice, consequent on a probable decrease of the revenue from the proposed revi sion and lowering of the land assessment, but has added that in any general measure of this nature due regard will be given to the ancestral and hereditary claims of the direct descendants of the said classes, who are entitled to special consideration on the score of former services. IV\—In his concluding statement on this subject, dated 25th November 1873, the Resident explains—(1) the grounds for his apprehensions of possible trouble on the part of the Sardars and Military classes, owing to the discontent that was prevalent amongst them in consequence of the action of the Durbar towards many of their number, and (2) the course taken by him to allay the same and to re move the cause of complaint. With reference to his remark that 80 or 100 Sille- dars were prepared to give further evidence regarding the guarantee of continued service conveyed to them by the late Graekwar in 1858, the Commission does not deem it necessary to take such evidence. V.-—On a full consideration of the circumstances connected with the griev ances of the Sardars and Military classes as already set forth, the Commission is of opinion that the uncertainty of service and the liability to summary dismissal without special cause or reason, to which these classes appear to have been sub ject at the hands of previous Gaekwars, have been seriously aggravated since the accession of the present Chief by the wholesale reductions he has carried out amongst them generally, in an arbitrary manner, and as regards the followers and dependents of his predecessor, rather apparently in a spirit of hate and vengeance than from a feeling of State necessity. ^ r ^ e power of the Chief to make such reductions amongst a class that is generally unfit for the description of service now required by the State, but w ose maintenance involves a heavy annual charge cannot, of course, be contested, ut as the measure, if arbitrarily enforced as hitherto, must be productive of dis- con ent and alarm amongst the hereditary Military classes generally, and those e1 ^ or otherwise associated with them, the Commission would suggest T? a ' ,i 1G \ e war s Government be advised to frame, in consultation with the e&amp;i en , some general rules for adoption in giving effect to such reductions in u ure, W1 . ensure fheir being carried out with due consideration to the claims ot the parties concerned, and will prevent the scandal and risk that must ? m f. J 6 ' Sl1 en &lt; e P ri ^ a f 1011 without compensation, or other provision of any Militai T servants of the service on which they are wholly dependent for the means of subsistence.1 se SCHEDULE II.

(2) Letter No. iy|, dated 28th June 1873, (paras. 1 and 2), (3) Letter No. dated 4th July 1873. (4) Letter No. dated 8th idem, (with enclosed translation of Dur bar yad); and was referred to by the Government of India in para. 6 of Foreign ►Secretary's letter No. 2209- p , dated 19th September 1873, to the Government of Bombay. Summary of the complaints of the B Commission, with the opinion No 1 summarises his grievances as follows :—Village area 2,000 bighas; Revenue Rs. 2,000 ; No. of houses 50 or 60. 1. Increase of ' Ghas dana' tribute by about 28 per cent, during the ten years from 1863 to 1872, two of the three increments made therein having taken place during the late Gaekwar's time. Complainant denies the right of the Chief to increase the said tribute. 2. Abolition in 1867 of Sirpao and Meshwani allowances previously enjoyed, aggregating Rs. 22 annually. 3. Reduction in 1863 of Griras Haks in Bijapur Mahal from Rs. 174-8-0, previously enjoyed, to Rs. 38-2-0, though the Government continued to collect the former amount in full, and retained the difference. 4. Further reduction in 1869 of 2 annas in the rupee on the reduced amount, on account of I nam Commi ttee tax, when complainant refused to accept the balance. 5. Deprivation by Durbar officials in 1866 of ancient right to certain petty dues from ryots of a Government village. 6. Neglect of Durbar since 1863, to enforce payment by ryots of a share in the produce of certain lands in the Bijapur and Kadi Mahals, to which complain ant is entitled. 7. Stoppage pending settlement by Inam Committee, since 1863, of Giras Hak in a village in Kadi Mahal. 8. Imposition of the Inam Committee tax of 2 annas per rupee on lands mortgaged, which falls on the mortgagers, when redeeming the mortgage. 9. Deprivation by Durbar since 1864, of petty powers of punishment in cases of minor offences, formerly enjoyed by complainant. 10. Imposition by Durbar of tax on second marriages. 11. Abolition, since 1862, of the practice of granting safe conduct passes to Thakors proceeding to Baroda. 12. Summoning of his ryots since 1862 by Durbar officials direct, instead of through complainant as formerly.2 13. Imposition by Durbar since 1863 of ' Mohsals, (attachment officers), on complainant and other Thakors, and compelling 1 them to pay their cost. 14. Deprivation by Durbar since 1864, of the right previously enjoyed by him and other Thakors of appropriating the property of such of their ryots as may die without heirs. 15. Levy of tolls by Durbar within their Districts during the last 5 or 6 years. 16. Imposition of 'Accession Nazarana' never before heard of, on the accession of the present Chief, at the rate of 25 per cent, on Grhas dana tribute, and 40 per cent, on Giras Haks for one year. Complainant was unable to pay the 'Accession Nazarana' in addition to the other heavy demands made on him, and was in consequence imprisoned, and kept without food for two days at Bijapur. On his release he went to Baroda with the other Thakors and petitioned the Minister twice against the levy of this tax, but could get no redress, and they all returned to their villages after one month. They had no intention of making a disturbance. About October 1872, they petitioned the Resident regarding the 'Accession Nazarana,' but getting no answer, after 3 months again petitioned him and the Maharaja, but no notice was taken by either. Two months later, or in March 1873, deponent complained of the Mohsals (attachment officers) imposed on him, and offered to pay the Ghas dana tribute due, but not the Nazarana. He was in reply ordered to pay the Nazarana first, and told that a force from Baroda would compel payment. He and the other Thakors then petitioned the Dewan and the Hesi- dent, but without any effect. In June they were summoned to Baroda by the Sir Subah, but were afraid to go without a guarantee. A force of 100 Infantry was then sent to Bijapur, and 1,000 or 1,500 men were called in from the Mahals, the cultivators then fled from complainant's village, leaving some 200 or 300 Jvolis there ; the ryots were forbidden to give the Thakors their dues, and deponent suffered a loss of between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 3,000, owing to his lands remaining uncultivated. The Thakors again petitioned the Dewan and the Resident and sent their Karkun to the latter officer, at whose invitation in July ' e y'■ anie Baroda. The force was withdrawn about the Dassera ; deponent and the other Thakors have since been attending at the Durbar, but can only ^e OIie reply, viz.. Pay the Accession Nazarana and the Inam Committee tax, and your grievance will then be inquired into.' * aa ^ 2 (VJUagearea 3,000 bighas ; Revenue Rs 6,000 ; Number of houses *&gt;00; Population 1,500) complains as follows :— 1.

His rights to certain petty dues from ryots remain unenforced. 4. His Grain Haks were commuted in 1863. In 1869 the Inam Com mittee tax was imposed on the amount so allowed to him, and he refused to receive it. The rest of this complainant's grievances are the same as those of No. 1. No. 4 (Village area 1,200 bighas ; Revenue Rs. 1,500, No. of houses 70 ; Population 250) complains as follows:— 1. His G-has dana tribute was raised from Rs. 246 in 1856, to Rs. 412 in 1869, at which latter rate it is now levied. 2. Giras Haks in 9 villages reduced in 1864 from Rs. 147 to Rs. 14-2-0. In 1871 the Inam Committee tax was imposed on the latter amount, and com^ plainant refused to receive the balance. Arrears, amounting to Rs. 762, due to complainant, remain unrealised from the ryots, but the Government will give no aid in their collection. Remaining grievances are the same as those of No. 1. No. 5 (Village area 2,500 bighas ; Revenue Rs. 5,000 ; No. of houses 300 Population 1,000) complains as follows :— 1. His Ghas dana tribute was raised from Rs. 880 in 1853, to Rs. 952 in 1866, at which it is now levied. 2. Arrears ot Giras Haks are due from Government to the amount of Rs. 239-1 which complainant refuses to take, as Inam Committee tax has been imposed thereon. Complainant's other grievances do not call for remark. His case is generally the same as that of No. 1. No. 6 (Village area 3,000 bighas; Revenue Rs. 1,500; No; of houses 300 ; Population 1,200) complains as follows : — 1. His Ghas dana tribute has been raised from Rs. 503 in 1860, to Rs. 751 in 1870, at which rate it now remains. 2. Giras Haks in 8 villages reduced from Rs. 452 to Rs. 290 in 1864. On the imposition of Inam Committee tax on the latter amount, complainant refused to receive the balance. Similar haks, amounting to Rs. 141 in two othei villages, have remained unsettled since 1862. 3. Grain Haks in certain villages were commuted in 1864, and on the imposition in 1870, of Inam Committee tax on the commuted amount, complain ant refused to receive it. Complainant's other grievances do not call for re mark, his case generally being the same as those of the preceding numbers. No. 7 (Village area 1800 bighas; Revenue Rs. 1,500 to 2,000; No. of houses 225; Population 700) complains as follows :— 1. His Ghas dana tribute has been raised from Rs. 292 in 1862, to Rs. 361 in 1872. 2. His Giras Haks in one village were reduced in 1863, from Rs. 22-8-0, to Rs. 1 8-8-0, and in another village have remained for 10 years unsettled. 3. His Grain Haks were commuted in 1867, and he has no; drawn the com muted amount, as the Inam Committee tax has been imposed on it. Complainant's other grievances do not call for remark. His case is similar to that of the other complainants.4 General Observations. The complaints of all the parties who have come forward under this head are almost identical, though the whole number of grievances is not applicable to every one of them, and it will therefore be convenient to consider all seven cases together in these observations. 2. Of the sixteen or seventeen subjects of grievance which have been stated before the Commission, the really important ones are only three in number: viz., (l) the enhancement of the so called ' Ghas dana' tribute ; (2), the alleged reduction of the Giras Haks, and the subsequent imposition on the sums allowed in lieu of these Haks, of the Inam Committee tax of 2 annas in the rupee; and (3), the levy of ' Accession Nazarana' on the succession of the present Chief. As regards the other items of complaint, viz., the abolition of ' Sirpao and ' Meshwani' allowances ; (6), the refusal of the Durbar to enforce the payment by the ryots in Government villages to the complainants, of certain petty dues formerly enjoyed by the latter; (c),the levy of the ' Inam Committee tax' on Inam lands; (d),the withdrawal from complainants by the Durbar of the powers of punishment in minor offences formerly exercised by them ; the imposition of a tax on second marriages ; (/),the abolition of the grant of safe-conduct passes to complainants when going to Baroda ; (//), the direct summoning of complain ant's ryots by the Durbar officials ; (h),the commutation of complainant's grain dues from the ryots into a money payment; (t), the 'imposition of Mohsals, (sowars or peons whose charges are paid by the defaulter), on complainants to enforce the payment of the Government dues ; (j),the appropriation by the Durbar of the property of ryots of the complainant's dying without heirs ; and the levy of tolls by the Durbar within the limits of complainants' villages—the Commission is of opinion that while the action of the Durbar appears to have been somewhat in considerate towards the complainants in respect of some of tbesft U L by the late GaeW, It add. tS'the SV™ rana, the Durbar alleges that consulted the Resident, Colonel matter; and it refers to taxes of ser amount, which were imposed irana was imposed on the wholeState, and, with the exception of the seven complainants, has been paid by every one liable to it, and even by the other Thakors of Bijapur, without objection. The Durbar made every effort to induce the complainants to comply with its demand on the subject of the payment of this Nazarana, and the move of troops to enforce it was only made as a last resource, and with the concurrence of the Resident. With regard to the other grievances of the complainants, the Purbaf inti mates its readiness to restore some of the indulgences of which they have been deprived, and generally to make all reasonable concessions to them. 4. The Resident in his final statement, dated 12th January 1874, recapitu lates the circumstances of this case, and the grievances of the complainants, and quotes various reports of the Political officers of Guzerat, all tending to show that the Gaekwar's Government never loses any opportunity of oppressing, and encroaching on the rights of the Girasias, and Bhayads of Thakors of the class to which complainants belong. He adds that it was this kind of policy that led to the transfer of its tributaries from the Gaekwar's control, to that of the British Go vernment, and remarks that the complainants consider themselves in precisely the same position as their Bhayad the Mahi Kanta Thakors, who enjoy British protection. Opinion op the Commission. I. In its general observations on the grievances of the complainants in this case, (para. 2 above), the Commission has recorded its opinion that only three of them are really important, viz., (1), the enhancement of the so called Ghas dana tri bute ; (2), the alleged reduction of Giras Haks, and subsequent imposition on the sums allowed in lieu of them of the Inam Committee tax of 2 annas in the rupee; and (3), the levy of ' Gadi Nazarana,' on the accession of the present Chief. As the Government of India attaches importance to the case of the Bijapur Thakors, it may be as well to discuss at some length the three grievances, which are, in the opinion of the Commission, worthy of investigation. As regards the first of these, viz., the enhancement of the so called Ghas Dana', annually levied from each of the villages, it should be borne in mind that the present Gaekwar is not responsible for conimeucing the enhancements. All that he has done is to continue, and, in some instances, still further enhance the increases made by his predecessor. The Durbar authorities maintain that what has been done in this way is perfectly justifiable; and that there is no reason whatever why objection should be taken to the reasonable increases, which have been made. This being the case the Commission proceeds to consider 1st, whether the Gaekwar's Government was justified in enhancing the ' Ghas Dana' in the different villages at all; and 2nd, whether the increases are reasonable, with reference to the revenue derived by the Thakors from the villages. In the first place it is of importance to bear in mind that no contract or Sanad has been produced by the Thakors, or is alleged to have ever existed, giving a guarantee on the part of the Durbar, that the 'Ghas Dana' shall always remain the same. This being the case, the Commission is not inclined, in the absence of any trustworthy evidence to adopt the view put forward by the Thakors, In arriving at this conclusion, the Commission has, to a certain extent, been influenced by what is known to have occurred in the British Collectorate of Surat. In that district are certain villages, the representatives of which, up to a few years since, from the time Surat became British territory, had always been in the habit of paying a fixed lump sum to Government, as the revenue assessment of their villages. On the introduction of the Revenue Survey and revised assessment into-the Surat Collectorate four or five years ago the whole subject in connection with these villages was fully considered. 6—2 56 The Bombay Government then oame to the conclusion that the villages shonld be snrve/ed. and their lands assessed at the same rate as the lamb of other villages in the vicinity. , , The consequence was that a very much larger, and a varying rental was de manded by Government in lieu of the fixed lump sum that had previously been paid. It is believed that the enhancement was proportionately much greater than has been made by the Gaekwar and his late brother, in the Ghas dana of the Thakors villages. The Commission does not wish it to be inferred that the cases are exactly parallel, but they are sufficiently similar to have some weight with the Commission. 3. With reference to the term ' Ghas dana,' this levy seems, in the opinion of the Commission, to be only one of the ' Mulkgiri ^ collections periodica y made by the Maratha armies, when proceeding_ on their annual tours. U er col lections under different names were levied simultaneously, which h a ve ali been lumped under the existing name of ' Ghas dana, which may roughly be teimed ' Jamabandi,' and which, in the opinion of the Commission, is liable to be enhanced at the pleasure of Government. 4. The Thakors' claim that they are precisely in the same position as their relatives in the Mahi Kanta, in respect of their payments to the Gaekwar s Go vernment, is evidently untenable. In the case of the latter, a permanent settlement of the Gaekwar's claims has been made under treaty, under the guarantee of the British Government. In that of the former, nothing of the sort has been done, and the authority of the Gaekwar's Government over them is as unrestricted as over any other class of its subjects. 5. The Durbar's proposal to make a ten years' settlement with the Thakors, on the basis of their average annual payments for the last ten years, appears to be fair and reasonable. It might, however, be better if he would make the settlement for twenty, instead of ten years, as it is of course important that this class of people especially on the frontier, shall remain in a contented condition. How ever, as before mentioned, the Commission has no doubt that in enhancing the ' Ghas dana' as has been shewn, the Thakors have no just ground of complaint, and any action tending to meet their wishes should voluntarily emanate from His Highness. 6. The next point to be considered is, whether the enhancements made by the Durbar are reasonable or not. This question the Commission cannot test very closely, because it has no means of ascertaining exactly, the precise amount realised by the Thakors, from each of the villages. Assuming, however, that the information on this point, given by the Thakors themselves, is correct, it would appear that the acreage and receipts by them in each village, are, in round numbers, as follows ;— ■ No. Village. Bighas. Receipts. Present Ghas Dana. Increase percentage, Es. Rs. 1 Ghanta 2,000 2,000 675 29 4- 2 Gasaeta 8,000 6,000 1,500 50 -f 3 Ransipur . 3,000' 2,000 379 30 4 Kuvadia . 1,200 1,500 412 67 5 Lakroda . 2,500 2,000 952 8 6 MaTiudi 3,000 1,500 751 49 7 Anodio 1,800 1,500 to 2,000 361 247 dstn * The last column' but one, it will be •seen, shews the amount now paid as u Ghas Dana,' whilst the last column shews the percentage increase during the period ranging from the last ten to twenty years, since when the rates have fluc tuated. Looking carefully at these figures, and bearing in mind that the acreage and revenue have probably been understated by the Thakors, the Commission is of opinion that the enhanced assessments have not been excessive. 7 . The next grievance of the Thakors, which the Commission thinks should be enquired into, is the alleged reduction of ' Giras Haks,' and the imposition, by the Durbar, of the Inam Committee tax of two annas in the rupee, on the re duced sums. On this subject the Durbar and Thakors are at issue on a matter of fact. It appears that some years ago previous to, and during the reign of the late Gaekwar, it was the custom for the Bijapur Thakors to levy direct from the villagers, their Griras Haks. These haks, it may be explained, were a species of black mail paid by the villagers throughout Guzerat to the turbulent freebooting classes, to induce them to abstain from robbery and pillage. The custom of directly levying these Giras Haks from the villagers proving inconvenient and liable to lead to disturbances, and the power of the exacting Girasias to make themselves offensive growing less, the Durbar authorities, very wisely it seems to the Commission, directed all Thakors and Girasias to abstain from making their levies direct, undertaking themselves to collect their dues from the villagers, and hand them over to the Thakors and other Girasias. Exactly a similar course was, many years ago, adopted by the British Government with reference to simi lar payments levied by the Girasias throughout the British districts in Gujerat. The Thakors now allege that theGaekwar's Government does not hand overto them all the amounts they collect as ' Giras.' The Durbar declares that it does. On this point no evidence was produced by the Thakors, neither, probably, was it procurable. In the British territories however, when the change in the mode of collecting the dues was effected, the Girasias were proved in many instances, in collusion with the hereditary and stipendiary servants of Government, to have caused larger sums to be entered in the Government records as their dues than they had previously received from the villagers. It is not impossible that similar attempts at imposition are being practised now. Be that however as it may, the Commission is not in a position to state, in the absence of trustworthy evidence, on which side the truth lies. As regards the imposition of the Inam Committee tax of two annas in the rupee on the reduced sums, it should be mentioned that the tax is imposed on all alienations from the State, and is not confined to these Giras dues. The Commission having discussed this tax, in its general aspect, elsewhere, there is no necessity for considering it particularly with reference to the Bijapur Thakors. 8. The last grievance of the Thakors into which the Commission thinks it necessary to inquire, is in connection with the ' Gadi Nazarana,' which was a levy of 25 per cent, on the land assessment, and 40 per cent, on all alienated lands and Inams of every description throughout the Baroda State, levied for one year, to commemorate the accession to the Gadi of the present Chief. This grievance is not more pressing on the Thakors of Bijapur than on other hakdars and cultivators ;the only difference being that the former have so far successfully resisted its payment. With reference to this ' Gadi Nazarana,' it has already been mentioned elsewhere that prior to its imposition, His Highness the Gaekwar declares that he spoke on the subject to the late Resident, Colonel Barr, and informed him of his intentions, and that Colonel Barr replied that he should in such a matter follow his own inclination. The Commission sees no reason to doubt that such was actually the case ; and though it is to be regretted that such a general and heavy tax, though limited to one year, was imposed, the Commis sion does not consider that any further remarks on its part, on this subject, are necessary. 9. In concluding its observations on the case of the Bijapur Thakors, the Commission would desire to point out that the Resident seems to have been, • , 1 _ • IpHpr No 103—552, dated 25th June 1873, he'lnfomS ^''Bombay Government, ' that the five Thakors who have been representing their grievances to the Resident since October last year, as reported bv me in the Administration Export for 1872-73 have now broken into open rebeffion, and have taken to the strong ground on the banks of the Saharmat. with about 1,000 Koli followers.' As a matter of fact, not one of the Thakors went out into rebellion at all nor did any of their Koli followers, the former appearing to be much astonished when questioned by the Commission on the subject. The Commission is at a loss to understand whence the Minister obtained the erroneous information which misled the Resident.SCHEDULE 11 Cases Nos. 3, 6, 11, 12 and 13 to 31. Grievances of the Agricultural Classes in connection with the ill-treatment and oppression to which they are subjected in the collection of the Government land revenue and other cesses. Complaints of the representatives of villages of the Pitlad and other parganas. Ditto of the inhabitants of the village of Viriao. Ditto of the inhabitants of Patan and Gahej. The complaints of the inhabitants of the Pitlad Parganah are referred to by the Resident in para 3, of his letter to the Bombay Government No. 118, 608, of 8th July 1873. 1.—The Resident has brought forward the cases of the inhabitants of the Pitlad and other parganas with the object of an investigation being made by the Commission into the general abuses of the Revenue administration of the Baroda Government, and the alleged oppressive rates of land assessment imposed by it. As these subjects were not however referred to in the instructions issued to the Commission as matter for enquiry by it, and as it was obviously out of its power to take up so large a question to any satisfactory purpose, the orders of the Go vernment of India were solicited on the point, and under its authority this portion of the grievances of the complainants has been excluded from the consideration of the Commission. The complainants' allegations of general and systematic personal ill-treatment and oppression at the hands of the Durbar officials have, however, been inquired into, and are summarised in the following para graphs. No. 1 deponent states that in July 1871 an old widow of 50 odd years of age died on the third day from the effects of a beating she suffered from some sowars and sepoys who wanted to compel her to pay the ' Accession Nazarana' and the Government Revenue, her sons having run away. The sepoys were after wards, on the case being inquired into, imprisoned for one month. Subsequently, deponent and ten or fifteen of his fellow villagers were placed in a row by a Government Karkun, and had a wooden beam put across their necks to compel payment as in the previous case. This oppression was practised by order of the Pitlad Vahivatdar. It is the customary mode of realising the Government Revenue, when it cannot be got otherwise. Complainant petitioned the Resident only. No. 2 deposes that, when at Baroda in 1863, he met people of the Pitlad villages, who refused to pay the increased rates of assessment that had been imposed: one of them a respectable man of considerable wealth was, in consequence, seized, handcuffed, and made to sweep the public road for two days. This example induced the other people to pay. In 1865 the Bhats and Brahmans refused to pay the Inam Committee Tax then imposed, when a force was sent against them and some 100 or 150 were seized, 18 or 19 being wounded, of whom six subsequently died. In 1868 the assessment of the whole pargana was raised by 2 annas in the rupee, and some 500 people came to Baroda to protest against the same. One of them, a Patel, was seized and put into a wooden frame, with a beam over his neck and his person 'spread-eagled.' He then received two blows, when he agreed to pay the assessment, and deponent followed his example. a —3 1T+ a common practice to make revenue defaulters stand stooping m the sun it is a comai r ^ witll weights on their necks, and such like, and touching J^eir ^ ^ fe]low ; illagers so treated. Twenty-five Kanbis have left his'villao-e within the last two years, being unable to pay the assessment. No% makes the same statement as the preceding deponent regarding the proceedings towards the Bhats and Brahmins for non-payment of the Inam Com- mittee Tax in 1865, and adds that in consequence of the alarm thereby occasioned, the rest of the people paid the tax. Two vears later some 20 or 25 Kanbis fled from his village in consequence of the imposition of a fresh tax, some were made to pay by being compelled to stand stooping in the sun. Deponent saw the Patel referred to by the preceding deponent put into a wooden frame, &amp;c., at Baroda as described by him. No 4 states that in 1871, he was seized and kept in custody for one day for non-payment of the '• Accession Nazarana' tax. On the same occasion the sowar who seized him seized a Koli, and putting his saddle and bridle on him, then mounted him. Seeing this the rest of the people at once paid the Nazarana. The sowar was alone. Ten kolis then quitted the village. No. 5 states that some 6 months ago a Karkun came to his village to realise the ' Accession Nazarana.' The villagers refused payment, whereupon some 50 of them, of whom deponent was one, were made to stand on hot bricks, touching their toes, while sepoys mounted on their backs for 20 minutes at a time, lha sepoys further turned the women and children out of their houses, which they attached. The villagers then agreed to pay up, and gave the^ Karkun Rs. 7, to leave the village. They addressed a petition to the Maharaja, but the Karkun refused to take it. Twenty ' Paggis' (watchmen) left the village in conse quence of the above, but subsequently returned. No. 6 states that he was imprisoned and fettered for six days in 1871, because he refused to pay the 'Accession Nazarana.' His cousin was imprisoned for 14 days on the same account; on payment of the Nazarana he was released. He went to Baroda, and complained, and was told the tax would be levied by instal ments. Consequent on the levy of the Nazarana some 40 people left his village. Of these about half have since returned. No. 7 states that in June last he, (being 70 years old), and three other men of his village, who went to Pitlad to protest against the levy of the ' Accession Nazarana' were placed by order of the Vahivatdar in a privy, and kept there till next day, when on giving a written promise to pay, they were released. Deponent and other villagers went to Baroda to complain of their ill-treatment and oppres sion, but were not listened to. No. 8 states that in 1867 a Nazarana of Rs. 50,000 was levied from the par- gana, on the appointment of Bhao Sindia as Minister, and the following year the assessment was raised 2 annas in the rupee. Deponent with some 500 others went to Baroda to complain against the latter increase, but Bhao Sindia ordered him to be taken away, and he was put into a wooden frame, and spread-eagled ' as stated by Nos. 2 and 3, he being the Patel referred to by them. He then agreed to pay, and make the others do so. Deponent adds that the present Chief has imposed new taxes, but has not exercised oppression in realising them. No. 9 states that in 1864 the people of the Pitlad pargana were summoned to agree to a ten years' settlement of the land revenue. The rates being excessive, they refused to accept the settlement, whereupon one of the chief of them was ordered to sweep the public road. They then agreed to the settlement. Depo nent describes the attack on the Brahmins and Bhats in 1865, as stated by preced ing witnesses, and adds that 200 Kolis fled, at that time, from his village to the Kaira Districts, owing to the ill-treatment they received from the Government sowars and peons. They have not returned.3 2% In 1867 the deponent's village was rated at Rs. 400, on account of theNaza- rana levied on Bhao Sindia's nomination as Minister, and on his and others refusing to pay the same, as being contrary to the 10 years' settlement, he and 7 other Va- re W|, tandars were imprisoned for 15 days by the Vahivatdar, to whom on their release, Hcji;' on payment of the Nazarana, they paid Rs. 800, for himself. In 1868 deponent yoccj, witnessed the ill-treatment of No. 8 as described by him. In 1872, on their re fusal to pay the ' Accession Nazarana,' deponent and some 50 other villagers were made to stand in the sun touching their toes, while pieces of wood were placed on their backs. They then paid the Nazarana. On this occasion 15 cultivators left the village. Deponent and others petitioned the Maharaja, but could get no redress. No. 10, states that in April 1870, the 'Accession Nazarana' not being paid by his village, 5 villagers were selected by the Mahal Karkun and made to touch rone If; their toes, while prickly-pear leaves were put on their backs, and stones on them, ion theThe money was then collected and paid through fear. Four families left the vil- on iiii'; lage. Deponent saw the above. A complaint was made, but there was no redress. azaraia' No. 11 states that in 1864, he and others demurred to the proposed 10 years' settlement, when some of them were imprisoned, and one man was sent to sweep the public road, as already described. They then agreed to it. He then refers to the attack on the Bhats and Brahmins in 1865 as already recorded, and states that owing to ill-treatment in connexion with the levy of the Inam Com mittee Tax, some 200 or 250 families of Kolis left the village, and have since sub sisted by robbery. In 1867 deponent was imprisoned for 15 days with others for refusing to pay his share of the Nazarana levied by Bhao Sindia, and had to give Rs. 800 to the Yahivatdar, besides the Nazarana, for ultimately releasing them. In 1868 deponent witnessed the ill-treatment of No. 8 as described by him in connection with the increased assessment of 2 annas in the rupee. In 1872, in consequence of their refusal to pay the Inam Committee Tax, some 50 villagers, ' including deponent, were made to stand in a row touching their toes till they rigonelln agreed to pay up. In 1872 deponent and his brother-in-law were made to pay Rs. 300 to the Thanadar of Bhavanta and Es. 550 to the Yahivatdar of Pitlad and his son after being detained in custody 8 or 10 days, in connection with their bringing a woman from Yisrampur whom his brother wanted to marry. The woman ran away, and they only succeeded in getting back Rs. 375 of the sums so paid by them on complaint to the Sir Subah. The foregoing evidence has been given by men all belonging to the Pitlad pargana. Many more are in attendance, but the Commission deems it unnecessary to take their depositions separately. No. 12, a Yatandar of a village in the Sinor pargana, states that in January 1873, the Yahivatdar came to his village, and demanded Rs. 8,500 on account of Accession Nazarana, The villagers declared they could not pay, whereupon he seized the whole of them. The hands of 25 men were then tied together, and they were made to stoop, while three beams of wood were put on their backs. Four men fell down, and were beaten by the sepoys, when the rest agreed to pay up the amount demanded. The Yahivatdar at the same time took a chit foi^ Rs. 2,800 on account of a tax of his own; Till 1872 such was not the mode of levying the revenue or taxes. Similar oppression has been practised in other villages. The amount was made up by the sale of the reserve grain of the village. The villagers petitioned the Maharaja, but got no redress. No. 13, aPatel of the Sinor pargana, states that in 1872-73, the Vahivatdar summoned him and told him he had to recover the sum of Rs. 20,000 Nazarana, which he had had to pay to the present Minister, and that his village must make up Rs. 2,000. Deponent protested that the ' Accession Nazarana'' could hardly be made up, and that this further demand could not be met, but he was imprisoned4 for 7 days and then agreed to its payment. The villagers, however, refused, on which ten of them were seized, and two flogged.. They then agreed to pay. The payment of the 'Accession Nazarana' was also refused, when the Vahivatdar made some fifty men stand in the sun touching their toes, till they agreed to make up the amount. The Vahivatdar's tax had never been levied before. Deponent addressed a petition to the Maharaja on the above, but it was not received. No. 14, a Vatandar of Sinor pargana, makes the same statement as the preceding deponent, regarding the Vahivatdar's proceedings in the levy of his tax from his village, to which No. 13 also belongs. Deponent and another villager were seized and flogged with horse-whips, receiving ten cuts on the back, when they agreed to pay. The Vahivatdar reduced his demand to Es. 1,600, of which Ks. 1,500 were paid down. The balance of Es. 100 has to be made up by deponent, and 'Mohsals' are now imposed on him to compel payment. Deponent petitioned the Maharaja, and gave his petition to the Dewan in open Durbar, but could get no redress. No. 15, a Patel in the Patan pargana, states, that in 1871, on the refusal, from poverty, of his village to pay the 'Accession Nazarana' some sepoys sent to collect it, took 20 of the villagers, and placed them in the open with their hands touching their toes, and with heavy stones on their backs, and kept them so for fully three hours. They then agreed to pay the tax, and sold their cattle and grain to enable them to do so. Twenty families of cultivators and fifteen of Kolis then left the village, and none of them have returned. Similar oppressions have been practised in other villages. Deponent petitioned against the tax, and was in consequence imprisoned for 13 days at Baroda, by order of Hariba Gaekwar. No. 16, a Vatandar in the Patan pargana, of the same village as the preced ing deponent, makes a similar statement to his. He adds that besides the 35 cultivators and Kolis, 5 shepherds also have deserted the village. No. 17, a Patel in the Patan pargana, states, that in 1862, some 200 Bhats were collected from different villages, and brought to Patan to be compelled to pay the Inam Committee tax. They were there attacked by sepoys, and 8 men and 1 woman were killed. Deponent saw the bodies next day being one of the Panch that was held on them and was of opinion that they died from sword cuts and other wounds. In 1871-72, to compel payment of the ' Accession Nazarana, some fifty men of his village were made to stoop with wooden beams on their backs, and other ill-treatment was practised on others. The money was then paid. Some 200 families left the village in consequence. From personal enquiries in 50 or 60 villages of the Patan pargana, deponent states that some 200 families, chiefly Kanbis, have quitted it, owing to the high taxation, and the oppression practised in its realization. Deponent was not personally ill-treated. f^ 0 ; a cultivator of Naosari pargana, states, that the 'Accession Nazarana was levied from his village in 1871-72 by force. The Brahmins were kept in custody for one or two days, and their cattle tied up. The Kanbis were made to touch their toes, carry stones on their backs/and so the money was realised. No. 19, a cultivator of Naosari pargana, states, that payment of the Govern ment dues is enforced in his village by making defaulters hold their toes, burying themm hot sand up to the knees, putting weights on their backs, forbidding them access to wells or tanks, and so on. •Accession Nazarana ' was paid in deponent's village two years ago &gt; borr 7 lng mOIle ? 1 the P Ur P ose - Peponent has himself been U-treated to compel payment of his land assessment. Some ten families nave leto his village consequent on the oppression practised.Q. U% No. 20, a cultivator of Dehgam pargana, states, that in January 1873, thirteen of his fellow-villagers were imprisoned for non-payment of the Inam Committee Tax. In the evening they were taken to the river and made to hold their toes, and were so kept all night. From the exposure and cold, deponent's brother, who was one of the number, died. Upwards of fifty families then left the village. Deponent petitioned the Maharaja about his brother's case, and an official was sent to investigate it, when the offender was convicted and fined Rs. 1,000 by the Maharaja, his lands being also attached. No. 21, a cultivator of the Khangi Mahal, states that in 1870, the rates of assessment were so raised in his village that they could not be paid, whereupon the village Accountant made nearly every villager stand touching his toes, with weights on their backs, and thus compelled payment. Deponent saw this, but was not so treated himself. Some fifty families of kanbis left the village in consequence. In 1872 the ' Accession Kazarana' was levied similarly, their women and children being turned out of their houses, and their noses and ears being pulled, ipoysi; 1 No. 22, a cultivator of the Khangi Mahal, states, that about two years ago, he and other men of his village, who were too poor to pay the ' Accession Nazarana ' were compelled to stand in the sun holding their feet, while stones were placed on their backs, till they were bent down by the weight, and others were put in the stocks till they agreed to pay up. Deponent petitioned the Graek- war, but was told that they must all pay their dues. No. 23, a cultivator of the same village as the preceding witness, deposes to the same effect, and states that he and all who refused, or were unable, to pay the Nazarana, were tortured as described and in various ways to compel com pliance. No. 24 of the Dhabhoi pargana states, that in the beginning of 1873 pay ment of the ' Accession Nazarana ' was enforced in his village by similar ill-treat ment to that described by the other deponents, and that he himself was subjected to it. In the end of 1872 the Vahivatdar summoned deponent, and demanded Rs. 4,000 from his village as its share of a ' Sadhnukri' tax he was levying to recoup himself, as he stated, for a Nazarana of Rs. 35,000, which he had to pay to the Sarkar on his appointment. Deponent refused to pay this levy, on which he was seized by order of the Vahivatdar, and taken to the top of the house he was occupying, and there tortured in various ways till he agreed to pay up Rs. 1,900 on this account. Of this sum Rs. 1,000 have been paid, and ' Mohsals' have been imposed on the village to enforce payment of the balance. Other villages were similarly ill-treated in this matter. The same Yahivatdar also enforced the levy in the same way last year, of a tax of Rs. 225 on deponent's village, for providing clothes for his newly married wife. Consequent on these oppressions fifty families left the village. The villagers petitioned the Maharaja on the subject, but got no redress—on the con trary, the bearer of the petition was imprisoned by the Vahivatdar. No. 25, a cultivator of Dhabhoi pargana, the bearer of the petition referred to by the preceding complainant, states, that in March last he was deputed by all the villages of the pargana to go to Baroda and complain of the tyranny practised towards them by the Vahivatdar in compelling payment of the illegal cesses im posed by him. Deponent has himself witnessed the ill-treatment and hardships to which the people have been subjected by this official, and describes them as stated by previous complainants. He presented a petition on the subject to the Gaekwar, but received no attention, and was driven away by the sepoys. As a 6—3 56 punishment for presenting the petition, the Vahivatdar afterwards seized confined him in his house for three days, when he managed to escape. and pargana Pitlad Sinor Patan Khangi Naosari Deligam Dhabhoi Kheiralu In addition more, who have 11 Pitlad pargana 43 a Patan „ 15 3 Khangi „ 19 3 DhabLoi „ 1 2 Kbeirakt ,, 1 1 Damala ,, 3 2 Kadi „ 33 1 Baroda „ 27 — Vagbadra,, 4 26 Teladi ,, 8 Saoli „ 1 155 No 26 a cultivator of Kheiralu pargana, states, that the rates of assess ment have, of late, been repeatedly raised, and improper cesses imposed m bs ^llaae In 1867-68 a Karkun came and practised all sorts of ill-treatment on the villagers, as already described, because they would not pay up. The \ ahivatdar was subsequently changed, but the same sort of oppression was continued to compel payment of these demands, and 50 villagers left the village m consequence. Deponent petitioned the Graekwar repeatedly on the subject, but got no redress. 2. The statements of the complainants in this group of grievances being o-enerally a mere repetition of the various modes of ill-treatment practised to wards them to compel payment of the Government land revenue and taxes, the Commission deems it unnecessary to record further individual depositions on the subject. The 26 deponents whose statements are summarised above, belong to eight different parganas, and the Commission has taken verbal statements from 155 other complainants who belong to these and sis other parganas and have attended to sub mit the same. The whole of these persons depose to the practice by the Durbar offi cials of the same system of personal ill- treatment towards the inhabitants of the villages to which they belong, to enforce payment of the land assessment and the taxes and cesses demanded of them, to these complainants, the Resident states that some 300 attended at the Residency, are desirous to come before the Commission, and represent the similar hardships and ill-treatment to which they and the inhabitants of their respective villages have been subjected, but as the evidence already taken appears to be ample for the object in view, and it is very undesirable to continue the excitement that already exists amongst this class of complainants in connection with the enquiry in progress, he is informed accord ingly, and requested to recommend them to return to their respective villages. 3. The Durbar Agent states that while the Durbar neither admits nor denies the truth of the allegations made by the complainants, it believes that their description of the ill-treatment to which they have been subjected is consider ably exaggerated, if not totally false. The probable truth is that when they refused to pay the Government dues, they were kept in confinement for short terms with a view to enforce payment. If any thing beyond this was done, which it does not admit, it was so without its sanction. The rules in force do not permit such proceedings as those complained of, and a general Circular issued in February 1873 distinctly prohibits the exercise of any ill-treat ment of any persons by the Durbar officials. (A copy of this Circular is handed in, and will be found in the file of this case). The conduct of the Durbar has been in accord with the spirit of this Circular, and all complaints of oppression reaching the Durbar have been regularly inquired into, and the parties guilty thereof punished. With regard to the land assessment, and the 'Accession' and other Nazaranas complained of, the former having been fixed for a term of ten years, when prices of produce were high, may now appear excessive, but the term is about to expire, and a new settlement will be made in accordance with the circumstances of the cultivators. The ISTazaranas, generally, were levied accord ing to previous custom, and the 'Accession Nazarana,' specially, was so with the knowledge of the then Resident, Colonel Barr.7 / w \ With regard to the statements that have been made relative to the action of the Government towards the Bhats and Brahmins of Patan and Pitlad in 1865, the Bhats of Patan ware ill-disposed to Grovernment, and were required to give security to keep the peace. They declined, and went about from village to village committing self-immolation, and even killing their own associates. The Govern ment officials killed none of them. The Sojitra (Pitlad) Bhats and Brahmins refused to pay the Inam Com mittee tax, and were moving people against the Government. A force was sent to arrest them, and twelve of the ringleaders were seized and brought to Baroda, whdre they were tried and sentenced to imprisonment. While in jail three or four died from natural causes. The present Chief has exempted these classes from paying Inam Committee tax. 4. The Resident's final statement in this group of cases, dated 5th January 1874, which will be found in the file, challenges the Durbar's remarks, as summa rised above, in reply to the depositions made before the Commission ; and, in reference to the Circular alleged to have been issued in February 1873, forbid ding the ill-treatment of ryots by the Durbar officials, observes that ' the system of farming out \ r ahiv;its and other offices, judicial and executive, initiated by the present administration, together with the prevalence of bribery and corruption, fosters the very abuses which the Circular was supposed to suppress, and thus it will continue to be in this unfortunate State, so long as the present administra tion is in power.' General Observations and Opinion op the Commission. I. The statements made before the Commission describe various sorts of personal ill-treatment and oppression alleged to have been practised by the Durbar officials, during the last ten years, on the complainants and their fellow- ryots, to compel payment of the Government dues and other collections demand ed by such officials. II. The items of demand referred to by the deponents are chiefly, (1) the increased rates of assessment imposed under the ten years' settlement in 1864, (2) the levy of the Inam Committee tax in 1864-65, (3) the levy of a heavy Nazarana,(apparently general throughout the State), by the late Chief's minister, Bhao Sindia, on his appointment to the post of Dewan in 1867, (4) the imposi tion by certain Vahivatdars in 1872 of private levies on the ryots, to recoup them selves for alleged payments of Nazarana to the Durbar on their appointments, (5) the levy of the ' Accession Nazarana' tax in 1871-72. III. As regards these several items it would appear, that (1) the ten years' settlement of 1864 was made at a time when the prices of produce were much higher than has been the case for some time past, and that it probably even then pressed heavily on the ryots. The fall in prices has no doubt rendered it difficult to pay the high assessment imposed under it, and this is in a measure admitted by the Durbar Agent, who states that a new settlement will be made on the approaching expiry of the present one, in accordance with the circumstances of the cultivators. (2). The Inam Committee tax was devised by the late Chief in 1864, and consists of a special cess of 2 annas in the rupee on the annual valuation of all Inam holdings. The levy of this tax appears to have been an arbitrary measure, aSi no benefit of any sort seems to have been bestowed on Inamdars to reconcile them to its imposition. (3). The circumstances of the levy of a Nazarana by the late Dewan, Bhao Sindia, on his appointment to that post, have not been stated to the Com mission, and are not known by it, but it appears to be probable that it was in accordance with the custom of the State, dnd it must, it is presumed, have been * J8 known to, and been sanctioned by, the late Chief, Klianderao. The hardship of imposing such levies where a fixed land settlement exists, is obvious. C4). The levy by the Vahivatdars of money from the ryots, to recoup themselves for the payment of Nazaranas to the Durbar on their appointment, is a common practice in one form or another in many Native States, and was for- merlv universal. It is, however, inconsistent with a fixed land settlement, and where the latter exists, such extra levies cannot but involve great hardship on the ryots. (5). The ' Accession Nazarana' was devised by the present Chief, and was imposed by him after ascending the Gradi, with, the Durbar Agent states, the knowledge and concurrence of the then Resident, Colonel Barr. Ibis tax con sists of a special cess of 25 per cent, on one year's rental of all Government lands, and of 40 per cent, on one year's valuation of all Inam lands. Such a cess has never, it appears, been levied before in the State, and its imposition no doubt added seriously to the previously heavy burdens borne by the people. IV. The responsibility of the present Chief and his administration, in res pect of these five heads of grievance is thus seen to be limited (1) to the alleged levy of Nazarana from the Vahivatdars on their appointment, and to the conse quent measures of these officials to recoup themselves from the ryots; and (2), the imposition of ' Accession Nazarana' at the rates stated, together with the oppression and ill-treatment practised to enforce the collection of the same. V. With regard to the payment to the Durbar of Nazarana on appointment by the Vahivatdars, the Durbar Agent has confined himself to the general state ment that ' the Nazaranas were levied according to previous custom and it is therefore to be inferred that the fact is not disputed. The Commission has no means of knowing what the ordinary amount of such payments is in the Baroda State, but while well aware of the existence of the practice as already stated in jnany Native States, it cannot hesitate to condemn it as an inevitable and fruitful source of abuse and oppression, and one which the Maharaja should be urged to abolish absolutely, as being utterly inconsistent with good Government. VI. As regards the ' Accession Nazarana,' the Commission has no reason to doubt the statement that the imposition of this tax was known to and concur red in by the then Resident. There can, however, be no doubt that the tax is altogether a novel one, and that its imposition has been productive of serious hardship to the people; and the Commission considers that the Maharaja's atten- 1 tion should be strongly drawn to the fact that such levies are wholly inconsistent with a fixed land settlement, the terms of which are virtually broken by their exaction, and that he should be urged, in the introduction of the new settlement now at hand, to declare that no such levies shall, in future, be made from the ryots by the Chief, or for State purposes. VII. Lastly, as regards the alleged ill-treatment and oppression practised on the ryots as stated by those who attended the Commission, there appears to be no ground for doubting that such has been the common custom for enforcing the collection of the Revenue. The punishments described are generally of the ordi- nary character in force in such cases in Native territory, and though doubtless painful to the sufferer, do not appear to have been of a very cruel description. Two instances are deposed to, (by Nos. 1 and 20), in one of which, it is alleged, a woman died from the effects of ill-treatment by the Government sepoys, and in the other the deponent's brother lost his life from exposure and cold, to which he had been subjected by the local official. In the former case, the sepoys were very inadequately punished with only one month's imprisonment. In the other the case was specially investigated, and the offender heavily fined, and his lands clLtH/CuGCL, 4. ^ 11 c ousideriiig this part of the case, it is necessary to bear in mind that the practice m Native States is to compel payment of the Government dues by seizure of property and personal process, and not by the attachment and sateof the defaulter's lands, as is the case under Britisli rule, and that, however abhorrent personal ill-treatment in any shape, in such matters, is to the Euror pean feeling, it is by no means certain that the ryots themselves would not think it a greater hardship to be deprived of their lands for ever, than to have been subjected to the personal tyranny exercised towards most of the complainants as stated by them, IX, The Commission is in no way disposed to palliate unjust or harsh measures, or proceedings on the part of the Durbar, or its officials, but it deems it to be its duty in these remarks to consider such practices as those under advertence, as far as possible, dispassionately, with reference to what its mem bers have reason to believe is common in such matters in other Native States, It is, however, clearly of opinion that the difficulty in realising the Grovernment Revenue that has necessitated recourse to such punitory measures in so many instances in this State, appears to be chiefly, if not altogether, due to the heavy burdens imposed on the people, and that this should be pointed out to the Maharaja, His Highness being at the same time advised to remove the cause of such difficulty by a moderate and equitable land settlement, and a faithful adherence to its terms in future, all further exactions of every sort or descrip tion, whether heretofore customary in the State or not, being absolutely inters dieted, and the continuance of such oppressive practices on the part of Durbar officials as those brought to notice in this case, being strictly forbidden. y ntr1 ?v O / SCHEDULE II., C ase N o . 4. SCHEDULE III., C ase N o. 10. SCHEDULE III., C ase N o . 14. Complaints of certain The general complaint in this group of cases is, that the Vahivatdars, or chief executive officers of districts, after having paid considerable sums of money as gratification to various Durbar Officials for their appointments, have been summarily, and often not long after nomination, displaced, without just cause, and without refund of the sums so paid. The evidence given before the Commission in this group of cases may be summarised thus:— I. — Case No.4, 1. Jethabhai Dallabhai states that in 1872, he agreed to take the Vahivat of Kheiralu Mahal for 5 years. The Revenue exceeds two lakhs. He promised to pay Ks. 1,000 annually more than had been levied in the previous year. This amount was to be realised from ryots, who had unauthorisedly cultivated land, and who held waste land without paying for it. He paid E,s. 10,000 to Nana Saheb to induce him to give him the Vahivat. This sum was to be paid in one year, in consideration of deponent keeping the office for the five following years. He paid Rs. 5,000 in cash at once, and Rs. 5,000 two or three months after. No entry was made in any account book and no receipt was given. He got his acquittance from Nana Saheb and went to his Mahal. Six or seven months after a new Vahivatdar was appointed, and deponent was displaced. He could get no explanation, and accordingly complained to the Resident. The gratifica tion of Rs. 10,000 was given to the Minister according to the custom of the State. In addition to the aforesaid sum of Rs. 10,000 to the Minister, deponent paid Rs. 1,500 to Narayenbhai, the Sir Subah's Karkun, andRs. 500 to one Gopalrao, the Minister's Karkun, Vakil of the Petlad Mahal. He signed the agreement, but from ignorance of the Marathi (Modi) character in which it was drawn up, cannot testify to the contents. The specified term in this agreement is but deponent distinctly understood that he was to hold the Vahivat for 5 years, an annual renewal for the period of 5 years taking place, on the payment at Baroda of each year's revenue. Deponent has never heard that any complaints have been lodged against him at Baroda, nor has the Durbar ever informed him that any complaints had been made. 2. The Durbar Agent replies, that the Mahal was made over in manage ment to deponent for one year only, at the end of which time his successor was appointed; that his case has not been enquired into by the Durbar because he failed to appear, though repeatedly summoned, with proofs of his complaint; that he embezzled public money, and has not given in the accounts of his Mahal; that there are now pending against him before the Durbar several charges of bribery and oppression; and that though directed to return to his Mahal, to give over charge to his successor, he has not done so. 3. The Resident in his final reply to this case, dated 9th January 187 4, remarks, that the term of tenure, whether the Mahal was let for one year or more, does not in any way affect the charge of bribery; that the fact of deponent having been displaced in Zess than a year is no evidence that the fixed term was one year; that had there been any reasonable hope of settlement of deponent's case, it is mosta improbable he would not have availed himself of any opportunity afforded, but that as a matter of fact, he was in constant attendance on the Minister, trying to ffet a hearing, and only appealed to him, (the Kesident), as a last resource; that the charges of embezzlement, bribery, oppression, and contumacy are irrelevant, and that the Resident is aware that when this case was first reported, attempts were made to buy off petitioner. The Resident concludes by observing that his chief object in bri ng i ng forward this case, is to illustrate and reform the most perni cious practice of the Minister of a State and the Revenue Officials trading in high Civil and Judicial appointments of this kind, a practice which, though more or less always in force, has been carried to excess under the present administration, and which induces men of deponent's class to run heavily into debt under promises which are frequently not realised. The bribe is always retained, and the pur chaser of the appointment often ruined. II.— Case No. 10, 1. Vasudeo Shivram states that in 1872 he agreed to take the Vahivat of the Kural Mahal. The revenue was about Rs. 1,06,000 annually. He agreed to pay the Sarkar Rs. 2,000 more than had previously been realised. He knew that many ryots held lands unauthorisedly from having bribed the Vahivatdars not to enter them as holding land, and he intended to recoup this extra sum from such persons. In addition to the agreement above stated, he promised to pay the Minister Rs, 2,000 ' Sukhdi' for himself as gratification for having given him the place of Vahivatdar, but it was not until this private payment to the Minister had been made, that he signed the appointment. Deponent expected to recoup this sum also from the ryots unauthorisedly cultivating land. He saw no entry of this payment made in any account book, nor was any receipt given him. When he went to the Mahal he took with him surveying chains, &amp;c,, and began to measure the villages. Then the patels of these villages offered to make up the excess if he would desist. He did so. He did not consider that he was accepting a bribe from these patels for suspending these survey operations. He did not realise any thing from his Vahivat that year. He had not been in pos session more than 10 months when the Sarkar sent a karkun to dispossess him. He does not know why. This karkun forbad the ryots to pay him anything, and they obeyed. Consequently deponent got nothing for having stopped the survey operations. He then came to Baroda, and complained to the Minister, whom he requested to refund the ' Sukhdi,' or else to enable him to recover the amount from the patels. A month before this the Minister had taken in advance from him, another gratification or ' Sukhdi' of Rs. 1,000, and it was only because he had not paid a further call of Rs. 1,000 that the karkun was sent to relieve him. Deponent has several times petitioned the Maharaj, but ineffectually. 2. The Durbar Agent replies that the ' Sukhdi,' or gratification, was received into the treasury and not by the Minister; that a karkun was sent to dis possess deponent in consequence of his embezzling Rs. 16,000 public money. The levy of further ' Sukhdi is denied. ,, I'TJ 16 Resident m his final reply, dated 9th January 1874, remarks, that the mere statements of the Durbar are entitled to little or no weight, in f^ce of Wot ^ P a Smg q + w •? T aS Put t0 tllis witnes8 when under examination the Commission that if deponent had embezzled Rs. 16,000 of public money, he might have been convicted and sentenced according to law, but that as no proceedings whatever were taken against him, the obvioSs inference is that tbe^r^e^na' bv^bservi 1 ^ 6 ^! ^ f ^ COncludes in ^ tbe preceding, by observing that the present grievance is not brought forward so Xits te^ - of ^4^ a ^ else ;that the farming system, at all times bad forfh^ especially vicious when the farmers themselves held theif farms on the most pre-carious tenure, as then the collection of the revenue becomes merely a scramble among the officials, each endeavouring to collect the largest amount during his tenure of office. III.— Case No. 14, 1. Dalpat Prema states that in 1871 he and two others, named Shankar Lalji and Daji Pandurang, (the latter did not appear before the Commission), entered into a written agreement with the Graekwar's Government, to take the Vahivat of the Vasravi and Gala Mahals of the Naosari Prant for 5 years. They were to pay Rs. 10,000 during the first year, in excess of what previous Vahivat- dars had done, by a careful collection of the revenue, and looking more closely after cultivation. The Yahivat was to be continued to them for 5 years, and it was distinctly so stated in the written agreement. In addition to the above extra payment, they agreed to give a Nazarana to the Minister of Rs. 5,425, and to furnish security for carrying on the work properly. They were in joint manage ment of the Mahals for 1^ months, when, security not having been furnished, they were deprived of it. They paid the Nazarana, or gratification, to the Minister in two sums ; the first sumof Rs. 2,000 was paid in Naosari, and the second of Rs. 3,425 at Baroda. They got no receipt for this money, and all they now want, since they have been turned out, is to get back this sum of Rs. 5,425. They asked the Minister for its refund, but ineffectually, and they also petitioned the Surat Collector, who forwarded their petition to the Resident. 2. Shankar Lalji states that he took the farm of the Mahals of Gala and Vasravi in Naosari, in company with Dalpat Prema and Daji Pandurang, but has no personal knowledge of the terms or details of the agreement or Nazarana. His cousin and sub-sharer Dalla Khushal can give particulars. 3. Dalla Khushal states that in company with his cousin Shankar Lala, and others, he took the farm of the Vahivat of Vasravi and Gala for 1872 in 1871. He paid, to secure the vahivat, a Nazarana of Rs. 6,500 to the Minister in three sums—Rs. 2,000 in Naosari, and two sums of Rs. 3,425, and Rs. 1,075 at Baroda. Deponent says that they only remained in possession for 1^ months when, through some treachery, they were deprived of it. Deponent came to Ba roda, and demanded the refund of the gratification to the Minister, but the Minis ter imprisoned him for a day and a night. He was released on security, and told to go to Naosari. It was stated in the agreement that security for the proper performance of the work was to be furnished within one month from date there of. This security was offered accordingly, but was not accepted. Deponent made no complaint to the Maharaj, and when he complained to the Minister, the Minis ter put him in jail. 4. The Durbar Agent makes no reply to these statements beyond observing that they summoned 1st deponent to appear before His Highness with proofs of his complaint, and that as he failed to appear, his case was not enquired into. The 3rd deponent was imprisoned for a deficiency in his accounts which he was required to make good. 5. The Resident in his final reply to this case, dated 26th December 1873, summarises the evidence of the complainants who, together, paid to the Minister, Nana Saheb, an aggregate sum of Rs. 11,925 as Nazarana for the privilege of farming the two Mahals in question for 5 years, but were deprived of their farms within 1^ months. They consequently demand the refund of the amount so paid. The Resident remarks that he has brought forward these cases to prove that the Minister has been in the habit of selling Vahivatdar's appointments, and that had the Commission considered it necessary to go fully into the question, complete proofs of the nature and details of such transactions would have been afforded. With reference to the Durbar Agent's remark that Dalpat Prema had not been sent up to them for examination by the Resident, Colonel Phayre replies that his reason for acting as he did will be found recorded in para. 4 of his letter to4 Government No. 173—852 of 18th September, in which he brought to notice the impossibility of subordinates sitting in judgment upon the acts of a superior, that superior being the Minister of the State in full possession of his ministerial duties. He further remarks the extensive scale upon which local subordinates, from the Vahivatdar down, are obliged to extort money in various ways, in order to re imburse themselves for their heavy payments to the Minister and other Durbar officials. Hence complaints against the system of Nazarana, and sale of offices are justly, it is said, universal throughout the Gaekwar s dominions ; and when it is considered that the Vahivatdar of a Mahal is not simply a farmer of land reve nue, but the sole executive and judicial authority of the district, carrying with him, locally, the entire authority of Government in both Civil and Criminal de partments, some idea of the importance of the office of Vahivatdar may be formed t —an importance quite unknown in British districts—and when it is added that the pay of the appointment is generally small, that large sums are offered to obtain the post, that every other office is sold to the highest bidder, and that bribery and corruption prevail in all quarters, it is not to be wondered at that the people are oppressed, that justice is sold, life and property insecure, and in short that the whole machinery of Government is obliged to have recourse to unlawful means to extort money from the people. The Resident concludes his remarks by stating that the above observations apply to the whole group of bribery cases, as exhibiting their effects upon the revenue, police, and judicial administrations, in all of which violence is resorted to, to extort confessions and agreements as well as money. General Observations and Opinion op the Gommission. I. The complainant in the 1st of the above cases deposes that in 1872, he paid the Minister a Nazarana of Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 2,000 to the subordinate karkuns, for the Vahivat for a term of 5 years of the Kheiralu Mahal, the revenue of which he agreed to increase by Rs. 1,000 annually, but that he was deprived of the post at the end of 6 or 7 months. The Durbar states that his appointment was only for one year, as shewn in the agreement produced before the Gommission; that his case has not been en quired into, because he failed to appear; and that he stands charged with the embezzlement of public money, and not having rendered the accounts of his Mahal. It does not call in question the allegation of the payment of the&gt; Nazarana, &amp;c., and this appears therefore to be admitted. II. The complainant in the 2nd case deposes that in 1872 he paid the Minister a 'Sukhdi' of Rs. 2,000 for giving him the Vahivat of the Kural Mahal, the year's revenue of which he agreed to increase by Rs. 2,000. The Minister would not sign the appointment until the money was paid. He subsequently paid Rs. 1,000 more, in part of a 2nd ' Sukhdi/' but was deprived of his Vahivat alter holding it only 10 months altogether. The Durbar states that the ' Sukhdi' of Rs. 2,000 paid by this complainant was received into the treasury, and that he was dispossessed because he had embezzled Rs. 16,000 public money. The levy of the 2nd ' Sukhdi' of Rs. 1,000 is denied. , , m 11 ' T he complainants in the 3rd case depose that, in 1871, they agreed to take the Vahivat of the Vasravi and Gala Mahals for 5 years, and to increase their revenue by Rs. 10,000 annually. f +1 Tlie • 1 ! t dep0n ! nt states tl:iat the y P aid the Minister a Nazarana of Rs. 6,425 lor the joint appointment so conferred on them, but that as they did not furnish the security required, they were deprived of it at the end of l-i months. , , -'P 16 2nd deponent states that he has no personal knowledge of the terms or details ol the agreement or Nazarana, on which the farm was taken by them.J' The 3rd deponent states that the Vahivat was conferred on them for one year, viz., 1872 only; and that he paid the Minister Rs. 6,500 as Nazaranafor it; that'security, as required in the agreement, was offered but was not accepted, and that on his complaining to the Minister of their being deprived of the Vahivat, he was put in jail. {Note. —There is a discrepancy between the statements of the 1st and 3rd deponents as to the term of the appointment and the amount of Naza- rana paid). The Durbar Agent states that the 1st deponent has been summoned to appear before the Durbar with proofs of his complaint, but that he has failed to attend. The 3rd deponent was imprisoned in consequence of a deficiency in his accounts which he was required to make good. IV. The Durbar has admitted the levy of 'Sukhdi' as a State Nazaranain the 2nd case, and has not denied the alleged payments in the two other cases. In reply to the statements of some of the complainants in the group of grievances of the agricultural classes, in connection with the levy of Nazarana by the Minister, the Agent stated that ' the Nazaranas, generally, were levied according to previous custom.' The Commission can therefore have no hesitation in coming to the conclu sion that the practice, on the part of the Minister, of requiring such payments, on appointments of this and other classes, is the custom of the State. It further appears that the Vahivatdars have, on the engagement to increase the Revenue previously realised, been permitted to undertake the farming ot their Mahals, an arrangement, considering the large authority with which they are invested, which clearly opens the door to the grossest abuses, and is who 11} inconsistent with good Government. The Commission is of opinion that the imperative necessity (1) of abolishing absolutely the levy of Nazarana by the State, the Minister, or any lesser autho- j rity, on appointments of all, or any descriptions in the public service, and (2), of interdicting and entirely preventing any personal interest, on the part ot the Mahal officials, in the collection of the public revenue m their Mahals, should be strongly and authoritatively urged on the Maharaja, and that he should be advised to issue a proclamation notifying the same publicly throughout the Baroda territory, a copy of such proclamation being furnished for the information of Government.SCHEDULE II. C ases N os. 5, 10, 41, 44, Complaints of Bar oda subjects of personal at the hands of theGaehtvars The following is a summary of this class of cases, as deposed to, before the Commission. I. Case No. 5.—Complaints against the Vahivatdar of Visnagar, Balvant- rao Trimbak. Gross case of torture committed by him on a Brahman woman of Visnagar. The only complaint under this head that has been brought before the Commission, in which the Vahivatdar named is concerned, is that of the Brah man woman, which has formed the subject of a separate enquiry in case No. 41. II. Case No. 9.—Complaints of (j) Velia Uma, Matadar, (2), Chagan Bania, and (3), Balvant Meru, Bhat of Jagral, Visnagar Mahal, of ill-treatment by the Foujdar Fattehram. (1) Velia Uma states that he was falsely accused by the Foujdar Fatteh ram of theft; that his house was searched, but nothing found; that he was taken to the Waghrol Thana, when his hands were tied behind his back, and he was suspended to a ' Nimb ' tree. He was then beaten over the body and arms, (the marks of which he shews to the Commission). He was beaten on three occasions; on the last occasion, the Thana Karkun, Raghunath, called on him to confess. Worn out by constant floggings, he at last falsely stated that he had given the gold bricks, (which it was said he had stolen), to a Vania by name Chagan. He had not stolen the bricks and knew nothing whatever of the matter ; but, in con sequence of this false statement, Chagan was seized and beaten in the same man ner as he had been. One Balla Bhat was also similarly beaten, though deponent did not give his name. Deponent was kept in custody for 5 days after he was beaten, and was then taken to Patan and confined there for two days, and was only released on his signing a paper to the effect that he had not been beaten or ill-treated. The Bhat Balla made a petition by post to the Durbar, which he concurred in. Deponent is not aware of any enquiry having resulted from this petition, or punishment inflicted by the Durbar. (2 and 3) Chagan and Balvant Meru make similar statements to that of Velia Uma, 2. The Durbar Agent states that the above complaints have formed the subject of enquiry by the Durbar, and that the Foujdar has been arrested and the case clearly proved against him. The Durbar is accordingly only waiting for complainant to appear, to pass sentence upon the Foujdar, and his assistant, E.a- gunath. 3. The Besident, in his final statement, dated 6th'January 1874, describes this as a ' very serious case,' and regrets that the facts have only been partially elicited by the examination of three witnesses before the Commission. He pro ceeds to anticipate what the results would be of further disclosures, He expresses his satisfaction, however, that the charges have been brought home to the Foujdar Fattehram, and his accomplice Raghunath, by the Durbar, which has expressed its intention of punishing them. 4. The Commission has taken the evidence of all the parties in this case who have attended before it to give the same ; and it is clear from it that the Foujdar of Patan, Fattehram, was guilty of gross violence and abuse of autho- rity towards them, and probably the other persons also, whose names are stated a— 5 19 \ in the Resident's final letter of 6tli J anuary 1874. As the latter have not appeared before the Commission, it cannot express any decided opinion as regards their case The official whose proceedings form the subject of the deponents complaint, is the same man who stands charged by No. 10 in Schedule L, with ^ a ^ in o had him flogged for the purpose of extorting confession of a crime which he never committed. The Durbar A.gent states that this man s gross abuse of authority in these instances, having been brought to notice, he and his assistant have been arrested and brought to trial, and that the charges having been proved against them, they will be suitably punished on the attendance of the complainants at the Dm bar. The Commission has since learnt that the Foujdar has been sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment, and removed from the public service, to which he will not be restored on the expiry of his sentence. III. Case No. 10.—This appears to be a further complaint of the same character as in the preceding case against the same Foujdar Fattehram, but the complainants have not attended the Commission, and it has not therefore been inquired into. IV. Case No. 41.—The torture of a Brahman woman, named Baini, by the Vahivatdar of Visnagar, Balvantrao Trimbak. The complainant states that last October, being suspected by the Vahivatdar of having received certain stolen property from her brother, her house was searched but none was found, and she was required to furnish bail for Bs. 500. Subsequently, she was summoned to the Vahivatdar's Kacheri, where she saw her brother and a companion of his beaten, and was told that the former had implicated her, and she must confess. She denied knowing anything of the matter, on which she was imprisoned, and her house attached. On the following day she was again brought before the Vahivatdar, who threatened that she should be beaten and the skin taken off her, and, as she persisted in her denial, one of his sepoys by his order commenced ill-treat ing her, by beating her with his fists and pushing her about, and not allowing her to sit down. The following day she was again taken before the Vahivatdar, who said that without a severe beating she would not come to her senses, and ordered chillies to be brought to torture her, using at the same time most indecent lan guage towards her. Red chillies were brought and bruised and put in small bags, and complainant was then taken by two sepoys behind a purdah, which had been put up for the purpose, at the end of the Kacheri, in which the Vahivatdar and his Karkuhs remained. She was then again pulled violently about by the same sepoy as before, who said the bags of chillies should be applied to her private parts if she did not confess. She cried out loudly, but to no purpose. The A' ahivatdar then ordered her with indecent language to be taken to the stable and the chillies applied. She was taken there by the two men, and her hands fasten ed to a post over her head, and after partially stripping her, one of them applied one of the bags of chillies as threatened, while the other made indecent gestures at her with a peg. She was again called on to confess, but would not, and cried out from pain and terror. She was then released, and sent back to jail, where she wept all night from pain and shame. The following day she was again summoned by the Vahivatdar, and told hei skm would be stripped off if she did not confess. She still refused^ on which 8 j 6 unr ^ eaten a ro P e - T* 16 Vahivatdar then ordered a ' tobra' of powder ed chillies to be applied to her face when a cloth containing some was bound round her mouth and nose for 10 minutes. She suffered great aaony. She want ed water but they would give her none, and the Vahivatdar sent her back to jail with the remark that 'it she still held out it would cost her her life.' Her nose and mouth gave her great pain, but nothing was done to alleviate it.3 The following day she was again summoned, and threatened with a re petition of the same treatment. As she still refused to confess, the Vahivatdar ordered the room to be cleared, and the door closed, and beat her himself with a small stick. She would not however confess, and was again removed to jail, one of the sepoys offering to get her released if she bribed him, but still using insolent and threatening language to her. The following day, under the promise of being released, and the terror of further torture, she made a false statement, when she was released on bail. 2. The Durbar Agent states that immediately the case was brought to the Durbar's notice by the Resident, the Vahivatdar was suspended, and a close and searching enquiry instituted, which is still in progress. In the event of the charge being proved, a most exemplary punishment will be inflicted on the Vahivatdar. He subsequently informed the Commission that sufficient evidence had not been adduced to warrant a judicial conviction, but that as there was reasonable ground for the presumption that the complainant had been treated with violence, the Durbar had decided to dismiss the Vahivatdar and the peon named by her , as having so ill-treated her, and to declare them also unfit for re-employment in the Gaekwar's service. The Durbar also had ordered Us. 200 to be paid to the complainant as compensation. 3. The Resident, in his final statement, dated 6th January 1874, comments on this case, and observes that there is habitually a failure of justice in such in stances, where the chief criminals are high officials in the Durbar's service; that the Resident has repeatedly brought to the Durbar's notice the notorious beha viour of this Vahivatdar, but that his representations have received no attention whatever, he being a protege of the Sir Foujdar; that he has served in several districts, in all of which numerous complaints have been made against him, and he is stated to have been dismissed by the late Chief, and declared ineligible for further service. The Resident adds his conviction that torture is systematically employed by the chief officials in all the Baroda Mahals, and that the crime is winked at by the Durbar. 4. The Commission having heard the statement of the complainant in this case, who appears to be a respectable and truthful woman, has no doubt that she was subjected to ill-treatment of the shameful character deposed to by her, though her statement has not been supported by evidence before it, to render it complete for the, le gal c onviction of the Vahivatdar. The course proposed by the Durbar for adoption towards the Vahivatdar, who is clearly a most unfit person for employment in so responsible a post, appeared to the Commission to be hard ly satisfactory or adequate to so atrocious an offence, but the Maharaja took occa sion, on the members paying His Highness a farewell visit before leaving Baroda, to inform the President, that, on further consideration of the circumstances, he had decided to sentence the Vahivatdar to 2 years' rigorous imprisonment, and to forbid his further employment in his service. The case being thus disposed of, the Commission can only record its opinion that it furnishes a horrible instance of the abuse of power and the suffering to which respectable people are liable, directly consequent on the employment by the Durbar of unfit and untrustworthy men in such responsible posts. I V. Case No. 44.—Complaint of one Kasiram Ambaram of Sidhpur in Patan. This case has been included in this group, in consequence of its having been referred to by the Resident, as one of violent personal ill-treatment by the then Foujdar of Patan, one Nalchand, of one Andra Sundra of that district, and his wife, both of whom are stated to have been severely flogged by the Foujdar's order, and to have died in prison, from the ill-treatment so received. The com plainant, Kasiram, has not, however, attended, and the case has not been inquired into.4 The Commission can therefore offer no opinion on its merits, but it observes that it appears to have occurred four years ago, and that the allegations would seem to rest altogether on the simple petition of the complainant. General Obseevations. V. The Commission is satisfied, from the circumstances connected with the cases brought forward in this group, and other instances that have come to its notice, that many of the officials of the Vahivatdar class in this State are seriously unfit for their responsible duties, and that the employment of such persons must involve a very large amount of misgovernnient within their respective charges, which probably never comes to the Durbar s knowledge. AA^here, as in the case of Balvantrao Trimbak, (Case No. 41), they are proteges of any of the members of the Durbar, they appear to be practically subject to no real control, and to be able to do with impunity almost as they like.^-2 ® SCHEDULE II. Cases Nos. 30, 65^. Complaints of certain women, inhabitants of the village Variao, in the Naosari Pargana. 1. The substance of the petitioner's grievance is that though their husbands are dead or absent, and they are unable to cultivate the land registered in the Revenue Department in their husbands' names, they are compelled to pay the assessment falling due thereon, and are not permitted to resign the lands, some of the petitioners who left the village have been forced to return, and have been subjected to all kinds of ill-treatment. Where the land has even been leased to other parties, the petitioners are still held responsible for any deficiency in the Government demand for it. 2. The Durbar's explanation of this case is that no land is let out by it under settlement for 10 years, except on the understanding that the lessee or his heirs and assigns, if he dies, shall be answerable for the full and regular payment of the Government demand on the same, for the entire term of the settle ment, and that security is further, as a rule, required to ensure the due fulfilment of this contract. Where the land is leased out to other parties, in consequence of the representative of a deceased or absent lessee, or the latter's security, being Tillable to cultivate it, such representative and security are still held answerable for any deficiency in the full amount of the original Government demand, on the part of the persons to whom it is let out for cultivation, and it has been always customary to exact the same. 3. The Commission has no reason to doubt the correctness of the explana tion of the grievance under this head afforded by the Durbar Agent, and is of opinion that the case is one in which its interference is not warranted. Looking, however, at the undoubted hardship inflicted on the petitioners by the grievance represented by them, the President of the Commission requested the Agent to have their case laid before the Maharaja without delay, in view to the same receiving His Highness' consideration, and in the hope that the relief of the petitioners from the liability under which they now suffer may be sanc tioned by him. a—30 1-4/ e) Hi SCHEDULE II. Case No. 32. General Attachment of Vatans tlirougliout tlie Baroda State. 1. No depositions have been taken by the Commission in proof of the general attachment of Vatans, as the fact was notorious, and admitted by the Durbar. 2. The Durbar Agent states that about 8 or 10 years ago, His Highness the late Khanderao attached all Yatans pending enquiry, and that His Highness Malharrao has issued a proclamation removing the attachment, by which arrange ment they will be restored and continue to be held as heretofore, until the right of the parties has been formally adjudicated. 3. The Resident, in his final statement on this case dated 6th January 1874, observes that the titles of the Vatandars are more ancient than that of the Gaekwar himself, and that the general confiscation of Inams, and spoliation o± all classes by the present administration have caused the greatest alarm and dis content. 4. It is admitted that the attachment of Vatans complained of, was the act of the late Gaekwar 8 or 10 years ago, and that the present Chief is only respon sible for not having removed it, which was, under the circumstances, hardly per haps to have been looked for at his hands. This he has, however, now consented to do, and the Commission would suggest that he be advised to adopt some equi table method of dealing finally with the questions at issue, m regard to the Vatans of the State, with the least possible delay, so as to remove all ground tor anxiety or discontent amongst these classes. a—32 1^4 SCHEDULK Case ISTo. 35. Complaint of Fakir Shaha Sahib. The complainant's statement is summarised as follows ;— Complainant came to Baroda between 2 and 3 years ago, from Southern India, and lived at a Dharamsala near the railway station ; nsed to write general Baroda news to a newspaper published at Rampura in Moradabad, but wrote nothing against the Gaekwar or his Grovernment; did write instances of ' Zulum,' (oppression) that he saw ; was arrested about 11 months ago in consequence of a person, with whom he had a quarrel, informing the Durbar that he wrote to the paper in question, and was taken to the Foujdari, where his deposition was recorded, and on his admitting that he had written to the paper, he was sent to jail; Was not told his sentence, but saw the warrant in the hand of the sepoy who escorted him, and that he Was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years, with Rs. 1,000 fine, or 5 years' further imprisonment in default of payment. The deposition of one Nathu Patel was taken at the same time, but did not refer to the charge against complainant of writing to the paper for which he understood he Was punished. After 9 months' imprisonment, complainant was released at the instance of the Resident. When he was arrested, his property of about Rs. 25 value, was attached and sold, and on his release he was given Rs. 4 which it had realised, and Rs. 2 more to pay for a railway ticket to Bombay. He, however, went to the Residency to tell his story, and was given a pass to remain at Baroda. Subsequently, being discovered when bathing at the river by some Baroda sepoys, he was conducted out of Gaekwari territory, and threatened with imprisonment if he again entered it. Complainant admits that 5 manuscript papers in the Urdu character, pro duced before the Commission by the Durbar Agent, are in his handwriting, and that the signatures on three other papers similarly produced, are his own. 2. The Durbar Agent states that a regular enquiry was instituted into the case against the complainant, that the papers produced before the Commission, which he admits were written by him, shew the libellous nature of his letters to the newspaper, and that he thereby committed an offence against the Maharaja personally, and his Government. He was accordingly sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment, but was released on the Resident's recommendation that he should be expelled from Baroda territory. The Agent denies that the Durbar ordered his expulsion notwithstanding his being in possession of a pass from the Resident to remain, and adds that the Durbar considered him to be one of its own subjects, and that it was justified in the action it took against him. 3. The Resident in his final statement in this case observes that the Durbar's explanation, though plausible, does not afford information as to the real cause by which it was actuated in passing so severe a sentence on the com plainant : that the latter was suspected of publishing libellous statements, on the strength of certain manuscript papers found in his possession, but that he denies that these were published, and the Durbar has failed to offer any proof that they were so. Complainant declares that he only wrote the truth in the papers pro duced before the Commission, and there is no legal evidence forthcoming to warrant so severe a punishment. The Resident then remarks that there must have been another cause for the latter, and states that he was prepared to give evidence that such cause was to be found in complainant's connection with the a—35 12 case of a housG servant of the Maharajas, who is said to have been poisoned, under aggravated circuinstances. Xhe Resident fuither avers that his interfer, ence in this case, was based on the sole ground that complainant was a Britigli subject, and that had the Durbar furnished its proceedings to hira when demand- ed by him, it could not have represented the case to the Commission in the aspect it has brought it forward. 4. The Commission has given this case very careful consideration, and finds itself unable to adopt the Resident's view of it, which is based on extraneous information which has not come before it, and on the trustworthiness of wEcli it can form no opinion. In the first place the complainant was not stated in the Schedule to be a British subject, and himself put forth no claim before the Commission to protection on that score, nor has anything transpired in connection with him or his case to show that he has any title thereto. According to his own account, he is a wandering Fakir and came to Baroda three years ago from the south of India, and appears to have no claim to any special nationality. Next, following his own deposition, which is that with which alone the Commission has to deal in the case, he was arrested on information given against him by a person, with whom he had a quarrel, of his being in the habit of writing to the public papers, and admitted the fact. He does not state that the manuscripts produced before the Commission were then shewn to him, but as these manuscripts contain the libel lous statements, which formed the subject of the charge against him, and for writing which he himself understood he was punished, there can be no reasona ble ground for doubting that they were so. The manuscripts in question, which are admitted by the complainant to be in his own handwriting, proved on perusal by the Jaipur minister, who is one of the members of the Commission, to contain a string of highly defamatory statements regarding the Maharaja personally, which, however founded on fact, were no doubt grossly exaggerated, and could not but render the writer liable to a very severe punishment in any Native State in India; and after hearing their purport, the Commission is quite of opinion that however they came into the hands of the Durbar, it was fully warranted in taking proceedings against him, in connection with them, and in punishing him therefor on his own acknowledgment that he had written them. The Commission, however, at the same time, considers that the sentence was very excessive; and though the complainant is, in its opinion, altogether undeserving of sympathy or interference on his ow^n account, it has no doubt that the action of the Resident in his behalf appeared to be warranted under Colonel Phayre s view of the case, and that complainant's escape from the long term of imprisonment imposed on him may be regarded as a not unsatisfactory result of that action.A SCHEDULE II. Cases Nos. 37 and 61. SCHEDULE III. Cases Nos. 1 and 4. Grievances of the State and other Bankers at Baroda. The case of the grievances of the Banking firms is referred to by the Resident in his letters to the Bombay Government No. dated 28th June 1873, (paras. 13 and 14), and No. ||-f 3 dated 21st August 1873, (para. 3). The following is a summary of the evidence laid before the Commission in the above cases ;— I.— Case No. 37 1.—The complainant, a youth of 18, the head of the old State Bank oi Hari Bhagti of Baroda, states :— (1). On his adoption by the then head of the firm, the latter paid 5 lakhs as Nazarana to the State. (2). In 1863 when he was a child, his adoptive father being then dead, the late Gaekwar exacted from his mother a bond for 20 lakhs of rupees, which, on the allegation of a Gumasta, His Highness claimed to be due by the firm to the State. Some 6 or 6 years subsequently, during which six lakhs had been paid up in part of this amount, proof was adduced that the money w T as not really due, and Khanderao remitted farther payments on the bond and ordered the refund of the 6 lakhs then paid up. He, however, neither repaid this amount, nor restored the bond, though he lived for 1| or 2 years longer. The present Chief has restored the bond, but has not refunded the 6 lakhs. (3). Rs. 75,000 were lent by the firm to the present Chief, as a private transaction, before he succeeded to the Gadi, and immediately after his accession, complainant was compelled to give him an acquittance thereof. (4). Some 7 or 8 months ago, he was similarly compelled to lend some dia monds and other valuable jewels, of the value of which he is ignorant, to the Maharaja, by whom they were kept, subsequent to which the bond for 20 lakhs was returned to him. (5). At the Dewali in 1872, deponent was required to give up to the Maharaja an emerald necklace worth 4 or 5 lakhs of rupees, to redeem which from the person to whom it was mortgaged, the Government lent complainant lakhs, of which sum he has since repaid Rs. 1,60,000, and at the same time His Highness took a chandelier and clock from his house. (6). About the same time, complainant was compelled against his will to give the Grovernment credit to the amount of Rs. 25,000, on account of the appointment of a certain person as cashier to Grovernment, merely because his Gumasta had promised that such should be done. (7). In 1871, the present Chief resumed 4 Inam villages and cash allow ances aggregating Rs 20,000 in value, and took possession of a garden at Baroda, all belonging to the firm. The sanads for the villages are produced and are admitted by the Durbar Agent to be genuine. a —37 12.—The Durbar Agent replies—• (1). The levy of a JNazarana of 5 lakhs by the late Chief on complainant's, adoption, was made in accordance with the custom of the State. (2). There is no record of the late Gaekwar's having ordered the return or cancelment of the bond for 20 lakhs. It was returned by the present Chief or the representation of complainant's manager, to prevent the firm being ruined and complainant then presented a Nazarana of the emerald necklace and other ornaments, Rs. 25,000 in cash, and the garden in Baroda. (3). The acquittance for the loan of Rs. 75,000 was given by complainant voluntarily. (4). Complainant offered a Nazarana of Rs. 75,000 for the removal of the manager of the firm appointed by the late Chief, and gave a bond for that amount He afterwards solicited the re-appointment of the same man, and his request was complied with. (5). As regards the resumption of the Inam villages, and the stoppao-e ot the cash allowances enjoyed by the firm, all debts due to the latter from the otate having been paid off, the continuance of such grants was no longer necessary 3- The Resident, in his final statement on this case, dated 3rd January ■u' e , n ^ ier ' s . V 1 ^ 0 801116 matters which have not been noticed by the complainant m his deposition, and calls in question the accuracy of the Durbar Agent's ex planation on all the points on which the same has been offered. i • , e y e j 8 ' ll0wever ' a discrepancy between his version and that of the com- p amant before the Commission, as to the year in which the payment of instal ments on the bond for 20 lakhs, exacted from complainant's mother, ceased, the former making it 1864 and the latter 1868-69. 4 -—The Commission deems it better in considering this case, to adhere to the fhl rinl ^ the complainant and admitted by th! W f + r at due consi( leration, it has come to the conclusion (1) that wM t^ the ^ 20 lakhs t j nm f+ ne n 0 1 thereon, which occurred several years ago in the opinion Caekwar, are matters on which it is not called on to pass an by the Drp^+ r rC- r f S + tll l eX £ aCti0n ^ of an acc l uittance the Rs. 75,000, due his accession anrl 1 \ 0 i 6 ^ rm . on accou nt of a loan made by it to him before by comnlainanf W jif n e m difficulties; (6) of the valuable jewels stated that aonears assigned by the Durbar, viz., the return of a bond der which it waq ' ^ri no J 0 ^o ei ' j us t]y valid, whatever the circumstances un- by the Durbar A ® ined ^ ( c ) 0 f a bond for Rs. 75,000 as admitted the Durbar itsp]f^ 1 0 1 omova l of the manager of the firm appointed by by the head of j 6 re f um P^ 011 of the Inam and cash allowances held predecessors for rn^nir ^ Under + hereditarysanads and enjoyed by him and his that the complainant in tS S ^ ' t nissl on is of opinion that, considering had malXown slSi?

Deponent was summoned, and directed by the Sir Foujdar to make a false statement, implicating 1 a certain person in connection with an alleged transaction of the late Bhao Sindia, and, under a threat of being imprisoned in fetters, signed two papers of the contents of which he was ignorant. Four or five months subsequently, he was again summoned and told he had been fined Rs. 15,000. On his refusing to pay, his debtors were forbidden to pay him their dues, owing to which he has suffered a loss of Bs. 17,000. The branch firm at Visnagar was also attached, but was released three months afterwards at the instance of the Resident. Three months later, the attachment on the firm at Baroda was removed, and deponent was released from confinement at his house, to which he had till then been subjected, on his furnishing security for Rs. 15,000, not to leave Baroda. He received back the papers of the firm 1 \ years after they had been taken by the Sir Foujdar. Deponent now solicits (1) that he may be allowed to collect his debts and car ry on his business without interference ; (2), that the fine of Rs. 15,000 may be re mitted; and (3), that his security may be released. 2.—The Durbar Agent states that it was brought to the Durbar's notice that the complainant had been induced by the late Bhao Sindia to make a false entry in his accounts in order to support a charge of bribery against Captain Salmon, the Assistant Resident, and that the accounts of the firm had been tampered with with this object. The Durbar intended to fine complainant, who offered to pay Rs. 5,000, if allowed to recover his debts,-the payment of which it had stopped, and it is now prepared to limit the fine to that amourit ; and to cancel the security bond when it is paid. The complainant's allegation of his signature having been taken compulsorily to certain documents, is untrue. He signed them voluntarily. 3.—The Resident, in his final statement on this case, challenges the Durbar's version ,of its proceedings in it, and urges l'.hat there is no record in the Residency of any such nature in connection with Captain Salmon, and that the action taken against the complainant appears to have been merely owing to personal ill-will and spite on the part of the Sir Foujdar. 4.—The Commission is not in a position to form a trustworthy judgment as to the exact merits of this case, but it infers from the' course taken in it by the Durbar, that there could have been no formal conviction of the complainant on any specific charge, and it is therefore of opinion that the action taken towards ] him was arbitrary, and unjust as regards the stoppage of his business. III.— Case No. 1 The agent and representative of the firm of Motilal Samal, Banker of Baroda, with branches at Surat, Ahmedabad, and Bombay, states that the firm was established at Baroda 125 years ago, and, at the period of the accession of the present Maharaja Malharrao, that it enjoyed from the State, cash emoluments and Inam villages, granted to it by his predecessor, of the annual value of about Rs. 35,000, and a Paga establishment of 62 horses employed in the contingent. About 15 months ago, the whole of these were resumed on the plea of an unfounded claim for debts due by the firm to the State for 50 years past. The sum claimed was Rs. 1,25,000, and the books of the firm were taken and have since been kept by the Durbar. The matter has since been cleared up, with the exception of an item of Bs. 20,000 claimed as Court fees in a case in which the firm was specially exempted therefrom by the late Chief, and which the firm therefore objects to pay. /4 About 15 lakhs of rupees are due to the firm from the Sirdars and Silledars, for the liquidation of which, from their pay, deponent claims the aid of the Gaekwar's Government. Motilal, the head of the House, went to Ahmedabad on urgent business about the time of the resumptions stated above, and the d&amp;j after he left, all his property and everything belonging to the firm was attached. He returned from Ahmedabad about 6 months ago, and was assigned a dwelling in the Baroda Cantonment by the Resident, in which he lived about 4 months, when he fell ill and went back to Ahmedabad. He died there after a few days. The firm has lost lakhs of rupees from the Durbars proceedings, and has been compelled to close its branches. It has lost its ciedit, and no one will do any business with it. 2. The reply of the Durbar in this case, is given in full under No. 21, Case I, Schedule II, in which that part of the complaint, which refers to the resump tion of the Paga establishment, and the emoluments and Inam villages enjoyed by the firm from the State, has been considered and disposed of. The Durbar Agent states— (1). With respect to the attachment placed on the property of the firm, that this was done in consequence of its head, Motilal, having left Baroda with out leave, and there being no one in charge of his shops and property there, that locks and seals were put on the latter, but no list was made out. The Resident was informed 6 or 7 months ago that Motilal was at liberty to come and take possession of his property, but he never came. (2). With regard to complainant's claim on the Durbar for aid to recover the sums due to the firm by the Sardars and Silledars, that the payment of any sums of this account guaranteed by it will be made according to the terms of the guarantee. (3). With regard to complainant's claim to exemption from the payment of Es. 20,000, on account of Court fees due by him to the State, that the Durbar denies that such exemption was ever granted by the late Chief, and that the fees demanded are only such as are usual in such cases. (4). As regards the resumption of the Inam villages, that they were given to the firm, when it had extensive dealings with the State, and large sums were due to it by the latter, in part satisfaction of which these grants were made. 'When it appeared from an examination of the accounts that the debts were paid in full, the Durbar considered there was no necessity for continuing the grants, and they were therefore resumed. 3. The Resident, in his final statement, dated 26tli December 1873, on this case, alludes to the Maharaja's personal treatment of the deceased head of the firm, Motilal, and observes that, on his accession, His Highness closed accounts^ with the old State Bankers with the object, according to his own account, of clearing off the large debt he found to be due by the State. He first, however, endeavoured to make this firm pay up 1^ lakhs in full of all demands, which sum was afterwards reduced to £ths of a lakh, and finding that this arbitrary demand was resisted, commenced to ruin the firm, by attaching its household and other pro perty ; ignoring the State debts and its responsibilities in connection with the sums due to the Banker from the Sardar and Silledar class ^ and finally, confis cating the Inams Nimnoks, Paga, &amp;C.5 enjoyed by the firm under grants from pre vious Gaekwars, The Resident has, during the last 8 months, endeavoured, but unsuccess- fully, to obtain a fair settlement of accounts between the State and the firm.The Agent who attended the Durbar for this purpose in September 1872, was detained in custody by it, to compel him to yield to its demands, till released at the instance of the then Resident. The resumption of the Inam villages on the grounds stated by the Durbar was never customary before. These villages were granted for former good, ser vices, and not in connection with current transactions, and the present Chief is the first Ruler who has treated the banking and mercantile classes in the manner set forth in this, and other similar instances. Finally, the Resident urges that the Durbar Agent has made no attempt to refute the serious evidence adduced in this case. ^ 4. The Commission has already recorded its opinion, under No. 21, Case 1 of Schedule II, that the proceedings of the Durbar towards this firm, in the summary attachment of its Paga establishment, and the resumption of its cash emoluments and Inam villages on the grounds stated, were harsh and arbitrary, and calculated to excite alarm, amongst the old employes of the State. It is not in a position to form -a judgment as to the claims of the Durbar on the firm, or vicevctsct of the firm on the Durbar, in the final settlement of ac counts between them j but according to the statement of the complainant these have been now adjusted, with the exception of the Durbar's demand of Rs. 20,000 on account of Court fees due to it by the firm, but alleged by the latter to have been remitted by the late Chief by a verbal order. The original liability of the firm for this payment is not disputed by the complainant, and it is not clear that the present Chief is bound to recognize as valid the alleged verbal remission by his predecessor of so large an item of State Revenue, though a careful enquiry into the whole circumstances might shew that such obligation did really exist. The Commission can, however, offer no opinion on the point. With regard to the reason assigned by the Durbar for placing an attachment on the shops and property of the firm, viz., the head of the latter having left no one in charge of them when he went to Ahmedabad without leave, the Com mission finds itself quite unable to accept so obviously improbable a statement, and it cannot but regard this act of the Durbar's as a needlessly high-handed and oppressive one, especially with reference to the long-standing respectability and reputation of the firm, and its undouoted claims to the protection and support of the Government. It is not in the power of the Commission to state what aid should be given by the Durbar to the firm in effecting an adjustment of its advances to the Sarclar | and Silledar classes, but it appears to be but reasonable that no change should be / made in the practice heretofore in force on this head, without fair and sufficient notice. As regards the resumption of the Inam villages, the Commission has no reason to doubt from the wording of the Sanads, that they were bestowed on the firm for former good services, and had no concern with current transactions, lif' JF.—Case No. 4 Amtha Ranchod, formerly of Baroda, but now of Bombay, states that he was forhierly a subject of the Gaekwar's, but in September 1869, took the oath of allegiance to the British Government, and became a British subject, of' which tact he produces a formal certificate. Complainant Was imprisoned and his houses and firm were attached by the late Gaekwar in 1867, in connection with a dispute with his mother ; and on his release and the removal of the attachment from his firm (but not from his houses) £—37 ' 5 /4 months subsequently, he went to Bombay and resided there the time required to enable him to become a British subject under the Act. When he was imprisoned certain jewels and State bonds, of the aggregate value of Rs. 60,000, were taken possession of by the late Gaekwar. Deponent subsequently returned to Baroda on the promise of the late Chief that the attachment on his property should be removed, and the jewels were returned, with the exception of a portion, of the value of Bs. 4,000. Deponent therefore refused to receive them, and at an interview with His Highness Khanderao two months before his death, the latter promised that all the jewels should be restored and the attachment removed from the houses but he died before these orders were carried out. The present Chief did not remove the attachment on the houses till 1872 when at the instance of the then Besident it was done, but the jewels and State bonds have never been restored to the complainant, who states he has further suffered a loss of Bs. 75,000 from the cessation of his business, in consequence of the proceeding taken towards him. In 1870-71 Balvantrao Eaholkar, the Naib Dewan, deposited Rs. 70,000 with complainant, taking his receipt for the same, and a year afterwards 'this amount was demanded from him by the Maharaja, who, on his declining to give it up till the receipt was returned to him, attached his firm, and his own and his partner's private houses. At the end of 4 months this attachment was with drawn, at the instance of the Resident, on deponent's paying over the Rs. 70,000 his receipt being then returned to him. This proceeding involved a further' loss to deponent of Bs, 13,000 or 14,000. lb® Durbar Agent states that in the late Chief's time an award of Bs. 50,181 was given against complainant in his dispute with his step-mother, and that Bs. 30,413 in cash and Bs. 19,768 worth of jewels were accordingly given 0V j r j 0 ( roin h* 8 estate. The late Chief subsequently took the jewels back and deposited them with complainant, but on his step-mother representing the case to the present Chief, he ordered them to be again restored to her. The Agent does not dispute the fact of the attachment of the firm by the present e , m connection with the Naib Dewan's deposit of Bs. 70,000 with it. i 3 ' Resident /n 1118 final statement in this case, dated 31st December 1873, o serves a e arbitrary proceedings to which the complainant has been subjected have involved him m losses estimated at Bs. 75,000 and Rs.13,000 res- mo- ^ ' e an la e 18 entitled to a full enquiry into his case, in view to obtain ing compensation from the Gaekwar. on-nnrtic '' , ^ e not in a position to pass any opinion as to (1) the bv thp k+P PvV k e attachment of complainant's property was originally ordered of wbioli I t a 'i 0 ' 0 f rea l value of the jewels and Grovernment bonds beino- insnfflmV 16 W ifi l e P r ^ ve( ^ ^ le information before it on both points being insufficient to enable it to form any judgment on them. attachino^mMnl 1 ?^ 1 ^'^ 0 a ^ e 8' e&lt; ^ proceedings of the present Chief in again ^ of a large sum de- one but few Nativ pk- T ki 111 ' measure was undoubtedly a harsh similar circumstanX ' W0Uld ^ oh&amp;b ^ have scru P le d to adopt it under gross abuse of his offlf' 1 1 a PP® arm §' the _ Naib Dewan, whose rapacity and that he was imnri^rm V ' P 081 ^' 10 ^ were notorious, had fallen into disgrace, and his property.

V. In its closing remarks on each of the foregoing cases, the Commission has recorded its opinion as to the merits of each, so far as it has been in its power to form the same, and it will only add that the general character of the Durbar's proceedings in them appears to it to warrant the view that the Banking classes at Baroda have, for some time past, been liable to harsh and arbitrary treatment of an unusual character at the hands of the administration, and that from the instances of such treatment that have come before the Commission under this and other heads of its enquiry, it is impossible to doubt that wealthy individuals or firms at Baroda, who are not in favour with the Maharaja or his principal officials, have grave grounds for alarm and anxiety as to the freedom from molestation of themselves, and their property. ks. i n# 7SCHEDULE II. C ase N o . 39. The flogging In this case, which has formed the subject of correspondence between the Resident of Baroda and the Durbar, and between the Resident of Baroda and the Bombay Government, eight persons were charged by the Durbar with poisoning one Tatia Powar, a confidential servant of His Highness the Graekwar. It appears that on Sunday, March 16th, 1873, the said Tatia Powar was present at some ceremonies in connection with the Holi festival which took place in the city of Baroda. After returning from these, he went to dinner, and shortly afterwards was seized with violent vomiting and purging which caused his death in a few hours. His sister appears to have suspected at once that her brother had been poisoned, and she gave information to the Police and Judicial authori ties, which led to the arrest of the following persons ;— These eight persons were at once arraigned and tried by the Judicial autho rities ; and being convicted, were sentenced to be imprisoned for life, and to receive twelve lashes each, at each of certain fixed places. The flogging was accordingly inflicted ; and one of the men, (No. 2, Grhanu), being, it is said, of a delicate constitution, died under it. The Resident states that those of the above eight persons, who confessed their guilt, allege that the confessions were extorted by the flogging in question, and points out that it is a question for consideration; 1. Whether Tatia Powar was, in fact, poisoned as alleged ? 2. 'Whether the flogging inflicted was a judicial sentence inflicted after a legal investigation, or whether the flogging in question was the cause of, and preceded the confession of four or five out of the accused eight persons ? The Commission did not, when this case was brought forward, feel in a posi tion to settle these two points satisfactorily, and thought the only means of forming some sort of judgment on the matter, was by explaining the particulars to the Durbar Agents present, and requesting them to make any remarks there on, they thought necessary. The Commission also requested to be furnished with the original proceedings held by the Judicial Court which tried the previously mentioned eight prisoners. 2. The Sir Foujdar, Balvantrao Eshvant, one of the Durbar Agents who daily attended before the Commission, then proposed to put in the original pro ceedings, containing full particulars of the trial, and all information as to what took place at the trial, which, he informed the Commission, was held before him as Chief Judicial Officer of Baroda. He added that the confessions were taken down in his presence, and signed by the prisoners before him in the course of the proceedings, and that these proceedings were completed, and the sentence of punishment pronounced, before punishment was inflicted. The original proceed ings were then received, and ordered by the Commission to be translated into the English language. a—39 1 1. Dajiba Kamati, 2. Ghanu, 3. Vithoba, 4. Raghu Savant, 5.

The Resident of Baroda in his final reply, takes exception generally to the judicial proceedings, and makes a detailed comment on them, and on tliG proceedings of the Durbar in this, and other cases. He also forwards transla tions of some depositions taken after the Commission left Baroda, tending to throw discredit on the judicial investigation held before the Durbar authorities. O pinion and G teneral R emarks by the C ommission. In this case it is impossible to form a satisfactory judgment. On the one hand, the Resident is evidently of opinion that the judicial proceedings, which have been placed before the Commission by the Durbar are perfectly useless and that they were framed subsequently to the punishment inflicted. He also, it is clear, entirely disbelieves the facts stated in the different depositions. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that the death of Tatia Powar was very suspicious; and, as far as the Commission can judge, he seems to have died either from cholera, or the effects of poison. In an English court of justice more definite evidence would have been required before the alleged poisoning could have been held to be proved ; and certainly more evidence would have been required before the guilt would have been held to have been established against the eight prisoners. But the Commission does not feel itself in a position to sit as a Court of Appeal, to determine whether prisoners have been properly or improperly con victed by the judicial courts of the Gaekwar. In this instance the formal pro ceedings held on the trial, have been placed before the Commission, by the Judge before whom they were held. This officer states that the depositions and state ments were taken down in his presence with due formality, and all'the proceed ings were completed before the infliction of the punishment. The matter was then fully explained to His Highness the Oaekwar, who himself, as he told the Resident, ordered the punishment to be inflicted; though under the circumstances, he would have been justified, he alleges in passing sentence of death on the prisoners. There seems to be no particular reason why, if suspicions were not entertained against the eight prisoners, they should have been singled out as the alleged perpetrators of a cold-blooded murder. And whether Tatia Powar was really poisoned or not, and whether the eight persons convicted of being con cerned in his death, were really guilty or not, the Commission is not convinced that the Durbar authorities have any doubt on the matter. It is much to he regretted that the flogging was carried out so brutally or carelessly, that one man died at once from the effect of such treatment; but bearing in mind that under the laws now in force in England and British India, garotters and other offenders are punished, and very properly, with severe flogging, the Commission does not feel called on to condemn flogging in Baroda, when adjudged as a punishment for heinous offences. In this particular case the Gaekwar might be invited to enquire and inform Government how it was that a man who is now alleged to have been delicate, should have been so severely flogged as to have died under ^ If- an ^ r care l essn ess, or needless severity could be substantiated against the subordinate who inflicted the punishment, or those whose duty it was to see it carried out, due notice should be taken of their conduct. All the proceedings, epositions, and the remarks by the Resident, will be found in the proper place.&lt;o SCHEDULE II C ase N o . 40. The seizure of respectable married and unmarried women at Baroda for compulsory service as ' Loundis' or liousehold slaves in the palace. The grievances of this class of complainants are referred to by the Resident in para, 14 of his letter to the Bombay Government, No. 144-756, dated 18th August 1873, and enclosed copy of his yad to His Highness the Graekwar, dated 15th idem. 1. The names of nine complainants are brought forward by the Resident under this head in Schedule II., as instances in support of the general charge, and the case of each is summarised as follows :— No. 1. Kaisobal Jetha Shaimali, of Baroda.—The statement given of this case, which is recorded at length in paras. 5 and 6 of the Resident's yad to the Maharaja of 15th August 1873 (referred to above), shews that the complainant's wife was seduced from her husband's house by a private individual, and that she refused to return to him. There is nothing whatever to shew that compulsion of any sort has been used towards her to make her a ' Loundi' in the palace, and the statement, that she is permitted to carry on her intercourse with the man who seduced her, appears to be opposed to the allegation that she is really a ' Loundi,' in the ordinary acceptation of the term. The Resident has been accordingly informed to this effect, and that the Commission does not consider the case to be one that it can interfere in. No. 2. The daughter of one Malsabi, stated to belong to the Indore terri tory.—The circumstances of this case are given in para. 7 of the Resident's yad to the Gaekwar of 15th August 1873, already referred to, but as neither the complainant nor her mother is in attendance, the Commission is unable to inves tigate the case. No. 3. Vithabai, wife of one Khondaji, of Baroda.—The complainant deposes that one morning when her husband was away from home three persons, one of whom was a Government sepoy, came and told her she was to go to the palace by order of the Sarkar. She refused, but, in spite of her entreaties and resistance, was made to accompany them through the streets, in which there were many people, but she did not call for help. She was, on arrival at the palace, taken before the Maharaja, who inspected and approved of her, and directed her to be taken to serve his mistress as a Loundi. She did not cry out or make any petition to His Highness to be allowed to go home. After 7 or 8 days she was released, her husband having made a complaint to the Resident about her case. She was not insulted or injured while in the palace, but was not allowed to go out without being followed by one of the sepoys on guard at her mistress' apartments. There were ten or twelve Loundis at the latter when complainant first went there, and some ten or twelve were brought subsequently, of whom she remembers the names of some. These women told her they had been seized similarly to herself. She received no compensation on her release. This complainant's statement is confirmed by the Government sepoy, who was one of the three persons by whom she was seized and taken to the palace, and whom the Commission deemed it desirable to examine. This man is identi fied by the complainant as the person referred to by her. He is now undergoing imprisonment by order of the Durbar, at the instance of the Resident, for having been concerned in another case of violence. He states he seized complainant at her own house, as described by her, by order of a Karkun of the Senapati's, (the Maharaja's brother-in-law), and a private servant of the Chief himself, that he a—40 12 took her against her will to the palace, where she was asked by the Maharaja himself if she was willing to remain. She said she was not, and was then ordered to be kept there. Deponent has taken eight or ten other women, who had no guardians, and who consented to go to the palace. Complainant is the only woman he has so taken against her will. He understood that she was taken to be a servant in the palace. No 4 Rambhao Balkrishna of Baroda.—The circumstances of this case are set forth in para. 10 of the Resident's yad to the Maharaja, dated 15th August 1873, already referred to. The Resident is informed that the Commission is prepared^ to investigate the complaint in this case, but as neither the complainant nor his wife will, it appears, attend for the purpose, it is unable to do so. No. 5. One Ganga.—The complainant is stated by the Resident to have left Baroda, and her grievance cannot therefore be enquired into by the Commis sion. No. 6. A Koli girl from the Mahi Kanta, in the keeping of one Balvantrao Nagarkar.—In this case it is stated in the Schedule that the girl, whose parents are unknown, wishes to remain with Balvantrao Nagarkar, and there therefore appears to be no complaint for investigation by the Commission. No. 7. Chandra Bhaga, daughter of one Kasi of Baroda, states, that about 2|- months before the Dassera she was seized one morning, when at her mother's house, by some 5 or 6 Government sepoys and 2 karkuns, and, in spite of her own and her mother's entreaties, was taken to the Maharaja at the palace. The karkuns said that she had been brought to be made a servant of, on which the Maharaja himself ordered her to be taken to the Rani, in whose service she remained 2^ months. She was not ill-treated, but performed ordinary service as an attendant. She told the Rani she did not wish to be a servant, but no notice was taken of her complaint. There were some 25 old ' Loundis' there, but she was the only new one. Deponent was released, at the instance of the Resident, 3 days after the Dassera, but received no pay for her services, and no compensa tion of any sort. She has now no complaint to make. This complainant's statement is confirmed by her mother Kasi, who states that her daughter was released as described by her at the instance of the Resident, whom she petitioned regarding her seizure and detention in the palace. No. 8. The case of 2 girls from Kattywar in the service of the widow of the late (xaekwar, Khanderao. The girls - referred to have returned to their homes, and their case cannot therefore be enquired into by the Commission. No. 9. Jagoba Jagtap, a relative of His Highness the Gaekwar.—The com plainant's grievance consists of an alleged attempt by the Maharaja to possess himself of the person of his kept mistress. This case is not, in the opinion of the Commission, one that it is called on to investigate. The Resident, however, states in his letter No. 1096, dated 8th December 1873, (in the file of this group of cases) that it has been settled. No. 10. Ujan, wife of one Partab Bharot of Baroda, states, that last August v nTI? mi- s ^ ie was seized one day by Government sepoys in oi e .—ihis case is not in the i -i &lt;.,1 i Schedule, it having come to notice . en at her father s house, and taken by them in since the latter's submission. spite of the remonstrances of her parents, and . 1 other people who were in the house at the time, to le pa ace, her parents following her. On arriving in front of the palace, her tather induced the sepoys to agree to release her on payment of Rs. 60, which was given them on their return to her home./ , *5^ \ Complainant knew they were Government sepoys because they said so, but did not know their names, and could not recognizer them if produced before her. Complainant's statement is confirmed by her father, who states that three sepoys were concerned in his daughter's seizure, and that as they came from the Maharaja there was no use in his complaining to the Chief, and he had not done so. He could not recognize the sepoys. 2. The letter from the Kesident, No. 1096, dated 8th December 1873, which will be found in the file of this group of cases, gives some further particulars on the subject, and adds that there are some 26 other females in a humble sphere of life, who would probably state their cases if accompanied by their friends. The Resident is further anxious that the wife of the Government sepoy, whose evidence in the case of the seizure of No. 3 will be found above under that, should be examined by the Commission, but as she has no personal grievance, and her evidence would necessarily be chiefly hearsay, and would probably be in fluenced by her husband's punishment, and further, as the man himself has been produced and examined, the Commission deems it unnecessary to take her statement. The Resident further suggests that the Durbar be required to reply cate gorically to certain questions which he proposes shall be put to it, but is inform ed that the Commission is unable to adopt that course, the Durbar Agent being at liberty to offer such remarks as he is authorized to make, but not being liable to examination himself by the Commission. The Resident is further informed, with reference to his remark regarding the twenty six other females, that the Commission is prepared to hear the grievance of any person concerned in this class of cases, who may desire to state the same before it, and may attend for the purpose. 3. No further cases having been brought forward, the Durbar Agent's reply is recorded. He states generally that females were never seized by the Durbar to be made ' loundis' of, that the orders of the sepoy, who has given evidence in the case of No. 3, were only to find out such as were willing to take service. Those he brought who were not so willing, were sent away. With regard to the case of the complainants who have appeared before the Commission:— (1.) The assertion of No. 8 that she was detained in the palace against her will is false. (2.) As regards No. 7—She had refused to live with her husband, who had petitioned for a restitution of conjugal rights, and was detained at the palace at his request to induce her to go back to him. She was released .fk' at the Resident's instance. Her husband's complaint is still undisposed of. (3.) Nothing is known of the case of No. 10 by the Durbar officials. If a complaint had been preferred, it would have been inquired into. 4. In his final statement, dated 2nd January 1874, the Resident has re viewed at much length the group of cases considered under this head. It is l5 tjf unnecessary to recapitulate here the remarks and arguments urged by him in this ^ paper, all the cases brought before the Commission having been duly inquired i J into, with the exception of No. 1, which the Commission has endeavoured, but •^1 apparently unsuccessfully, to point out to the Resident was a case of se- cK'iction, the woman having left her husband's house of her own free will, and not W one falling within the scope of the general charge at the head of this summary, or with which the British Resident apparently had any authority to interfere I4 officially, or this Commission was called on to deal The circumstances under which the woman in this case has returned to her husband, not having come before the Commission, it can form no opinion on that point, but there is nothin* in this case to warrant the belief that the woman was taken into the palace against her will. With respect to the Resident's observations regarding the non -examination by the Commission of the wife of the Government sepoy, whose evidence i s summarised above, in case 'No. 3, the reason already assigned for the course taken by it, appears sufficiently explanatory, but it may be proper to add here that the Commission has from the first found it absolutely necessary to decide against its being, on any plea whatever, drawn into the reception of vague statements from parties who had no personal grievance to bring forward, and to restrict its proceedings to the hearing and recording of the complaints of those who desired to lay before it their own individual hardships. The propriety of this determination has been abundantly proved in the course of the Commission's proceedings. The case of the two women formerly belonging to the Ratnagiri district, referred to in the latter part of the Resident's letter, has been already disposed of in cases 12 and 13 of Schedule I. G eneral O bservations and O pinion op the C ommission. I. The cases under this head which have actually come before the Com- mission for investigation by it are only three in number, viz., Nos. 3, 7, and 10. II. With regard to Nos. 3 and 7, the Commission has no doubt of the truth of the statements made by them of their forcible abduction from their homes by Durbar servants, and removal to the palace to render forced service within its walls, and that the Maharaja himself was personally cognizant of this arbitrary proceeding, and himself directed their detention, the fact of which latter, and of their unwillingness to serve in the Palace, is virtually admitted by the Durbar itself in its yads to the Resident, (dated 22nd August, and 26th September 1873), quoted in his final letter of 2nd January 1874. The Commission is further of opinion that the explanation given to it by the Durbar Agent in both these cases is altogether unsatisfactory, and in no way relieves the Maharaja from the grave and serious personal scandal involved in the shamefully oppressive treatment, to which these poor women were subjected, III. The case of No. 10 is not so clear, as it rests entirely on the state ments of the complainant and her father ; but the Commission sees no reason to doubt the general accuracy of this complaint also, and draws from it the con clusion that, as might be expected, the inferior agents employed—to quote the words of the Durbar Agent himself—'to find out' (and bring to the palace) ' such women as were willing to enter its service,' were not slow to take ad- vantage of the opportunities for oppression afforded them by so questionable a Commission, IV. The evidence of No, 7 on the point of the forced detention in the palace of other women besides herself, who had similarly been seized, is to the effect that though there were 25 other old ' Loundis' in attendance on the Rani, she was the only new one. y*** I/' On the other hand No. 3 deposes that 10 or 12 'Loundis' were in attendance on the Maharaja s mistress when she was sent to her, and that about the same number were brought after her arrival, and that all these stated that they had been seized and carried off in the same way as herself.&lt;3ly Tke statements recorded by tlie Resident in his letter dated 2nd January 1874, regarding cases Nos. 2 and 5 in this group, appear to the Commission to be conclusive as to the fact of these -women having also been taken to the palace against their will, and detained there for forced service. V. On a full consideration of all that has thus come before it, the Com mission can only form the opinion that several cases of the description stated have undoubtedly occurred, involving an abuse of power on the part of the Maharaja, and oppression by certain inferior Durbar officials and servants, which have brought a most serious scandal on the personal character of the Chief himself, and the administration, of which he is the head. It is proper to add that the evidence of the complainants who have come before the Commission, and the statements furnished by the Resident in re ference to cases Kos. 2 and 5, refer solely to the unjust seizure and detention of these persons to render forced service in the palace, as attendants on the Rani and the Chief's mistress, but make no allusion to the object of such seizure having been for immoral purposes, or aver that any of them were subjected to treat ment of the latter character. i—40 5SCHEDULE I] Case Nq . 42. Grievances of the members of the late Gaekwar's family, who complain that they have suffered hardships at the hands of His Highness, the present Gaekwar. _ No. 1. The case of Hani Jamnabae having No. datedTlSovember ISTsl been already dealt with under the orders ot Go vernment, no enquiry into it appears to be called for. I. The following is a summary of the evidence laid before the Commission in the following eases:— No. 2. Anandrao Viswasrao, brother of the widow of Khanderao, states that on the marriage with his sister, the late Gaekwar granted to him under Sanad, (admitted by the Durbar to be genuine), a pagah of 45 horse with an annual allowance of Rs. 42,000 in perpetuity, subject to service, and an Inam village on the same tenure without service ; that he was not only without cause deprived of the whole shortly after Khanderao's death, but also of house property to the extent of Rs. 83,600. He accordingly prays for restitution. (2). The Durbar Agent replies that Anandrao being the Rani's brother, the present Gaekwar Government had no confidence in him, and therefore ordered the resumption complained of. He adds that the houses referred to were not private but Government property. No. 3, Manjulabae, who appears by her husband Kasirao, states that she is the daughter of the late Maharaj, that immediately after her father's death she was deprived of the house in which she lived. It was the gift of her father, and she therefore cannot say its value; that she was also despoiled of jewels and ornaments amounting to about Rs. 75,000 ; that on application for restoration she was distinctly informed that nothing would be returned. Subsequently, about a year after her father's death, she was turned out of the house in which she was residing, and compelled to go to another, though she had just been con fined. On this occasion the furniture, &amp;c., was thrown into the streets. Man julabae also adds that notwithstanding her remonstrances, one Was ant Ram- bhao, a favourite of the present Chief, has been permitted to build a house on a plot of ground, which belongs to her. She concludes by saying that from the Inam village, value Rs. 5,150, assigned to her by Khanderao for maintenance, the Havaldar and five sepoys, attached to it for protection, have been with drawn. (2). The Durbar Agent replies that the house, in which Manjulabae lived being Government property, another was given to her for use ; that the jewels and ornaments belonged to the State, though, as one of the royal family, she occasionally wore them. Her marriage gifts only were her sole peculium, and they were not touched. The plot of ground referred to was Government property. Finally, the gift of the village being Kaniyadan, (or gift to a daughter), sepoys were never allowed for its protection,. No. 4, Kasirao Ganpat, states that he married Manjulabae, daughter of His Highness Khanderao, in 1867, that fitting arrangements for his support were promi sed, but that an annual allowance of Rs. 12,000 was all that he actually then received. This was reduced to Rs. 8,000 at the expiration of one year after Khanderao 's death. An elephant, with howdah and trappings of silver, was given a—42 12 w t,n him bv the late Gaekwar. He, instead of accepting the animal, took Us. 3,005 in cash Ld deposited the howdah and trappings for safe custody m tho 'Hathi T?i!z,'» These the present Maharaj refuses to give up. He prays for restitution, includtng his wife's OTnaments, &amp;c. (2) The Durbar Agent replies that Kasirao s allowance is nxed at the same rate as that granted to the sons-in-law of the late Ganpatrao Maharaj, and that the sum of Es. 3,000 substituted for the elephant included the value of the howdah and trapping. No. 5, Chimnia Sahib Lakshmanrao, maternal uncle of one of the widows of the late Maharaja, states that he enjoyed an annual allowance of Rs. 500 o-ranted by Seiajirao Gaekwar, which was increased to Ks. 2,400 by the late Gaekwar but on the latter's death the whole was stopped. He thereupon ran away to Oodeypur in Rewa Kanta, where he now resides. He held no Sanad for this allowance, and on its cessation neither petitioned the present Gaekwar nor complained to the Resident. (2). The Durbar Agent replies that as the present Gaekwar Government had no confidence in Chimma Sahib, it dismissed him. No. 6, Amrutrao, son of the late Maharaj, by one Sakubae, his mistress, who is still living, states that his mother enjoyed emoluments annually to the extent of Es 32 000, made up from an I nam village valued at Rs. 16,000, cash from the treasury Rs. 9,000, and Rs. 7,000 from the Mahals. He produces a Sanad, (admitted by the Durbar to be genuine), showing his mother's title'to draw the item of Rs. 9,000 annually from the Farnavis. These allowances, together with Es. 35,000 for a pagah of 50 horse, were summarily stopped shortly after Khanderao's death. At the same time his mother's jewels valued at about three lakhs of Eupees, and a garden called the Hira Bagh were taken from her. The pagah has been made over to Elajirao, brother-in-law of the present Maharaj, and the garden to Nana Sahib Khanvelkar, the Minister. Amrutrao adds in conclusion that absolutely nothing has been left to them, (2). The Durbar Agent replies that, Sakubae was permitted, during His Highness Khanderao's lifetime, to use valuable State jewels. She has no claim to them as private property, and they have accordingly been deposited in the Jamdar Khana. Sakubae and her son Amrutrao have refused to accept an allowance (viz., between Es. 7,000 and Rs. 8,000), fixed at the rate usually given to mistresses of deceased Gaekwars. The garden referred to is Government property. The pagah and allowances are dependent on services, which are neither rendered by, nor required from, Amrutrao. They have consequently been resumed. II.— L The Resident's final statement in this group of cases dated 2nd January 1874, which will be found in the file, challenges in some degree the correctness of the Durbars remarks, as summarised above, in reply to the depositions made before the Commission, and while not doubting the legal right of the Durbar to make the various reductions complained of, and to discontinue the allowances and perquisites of the relatives of the late Maharaj, urges that the same has not been done in good faith and honesty; that abundant proof is manifest that these measures have been carried out in a malicious and vindictive spirit, and generally that the family and followers of the late Gaekwar have suffered systematic perse cution at the hands of the present reigning Gaekwar, and that the plea of want of confidence is merely raised to cover the act of spoliation. General O bservations and Opinion op the Commission. Ill- The Commission is of opinion that while it appears to it to be im possible to question the authority of the reigning Chief to modify or resume grants by his predecessor of the nature referred to in the complaints in this group• such measures being in no way unusual or extraordinary under similar circum stances in most Native States—the course taken against the complainants by the present Gaekwar has been so unusually harsh and severe, as to justify the Resident's view that it has been due to a vindictive feeling towards his brother's relatives, which cannot but be damaging to his reputation, and alarming to all associated with, or who enjoyed the favour of, the late Chief. 2, The entire deprival of the late Khanderao's brother-in-law (deponent No. 2); of the uncle of one of his wives (deponent No. 5) ; and of his illegitimate son (deponent No. 6); of the whole of the provision assigned them severally by the late Chief, appears to have been an extremely harsh proceeding, though the Commission is not disposed to question the resumption of the pagahs of horse held by No. 2 and the mother of No. 6, and that of the State jewels in the latter's possession, and it is further of opinion that the justice of making some reduction in the other extravagant emoluments enjoyed by this woman from the State cannot be disputed. 3. The proceedings taken against the daughter of the late Chief, in the deprivation of her ornaments and jewels, and her expulsion from the house in which she lived, on the grounds stated, appear also to have been harsh, but as she has been continued in possession of the Inam village assigned by His Highness Khanderao for her maintenance, and her husband has been permitted the enjoy ment of Rs. 8,000 of the annual allowance of Rs. 12,000 originally granted him on his marriage, their case is not so bad as that of the persons referred to in the preceding paragraph. ted, te &gt; hasnofi id in the t ■pt an al : yen to^ pfji •renoW d. ted 2®^ he corr^ I#' if'SCHEDULE No. II. Cases Nos . 45 to 56. Grievances of the followers and servants of tlie late Khanderao Gaekwar, who allege that they have suffered hardships at the hands of His Highness the present Gaekwar. I.— Case N 45. 1. Munshi Habibnla Karimnla, who was a personal attendant of the late Khanderao Gaekwar, states that he was favourably looked on by the late Gaek war, who gave him money, jewels, clothes, houses, and a village; that immediately on the late Gaekwar's death, all this property was attached by orders of the present Gaekwar and eventually confiscated; that he himself was thrown into prison and confined there many months; and that finally, on his release, he was cast out on the world penniless. 2. The Durbar Agent states in reply, that complainant was, on the death of the late Gaekwar, sentenced to imprisonment for concealment of crimes and other improper conduct; that as he belongs to the party which is inimical to the present Maharaj, his services have been dispensed with, and his village and allowances resumed; that the village which he alleges he bought has been attached pending enquiry; that the houses and other property of which he says he has been dispossessed, are Government property and not his; that his intimacy with the late Bhao Sindia allowed him to misappropriate State property; and that therefore his private property amounting to about Rs. 27,000, has been taken possession of to satisfy State claims. 3. The Resident, in his final statement, urges that the reply of the Durbar is utterly unsatisfactory ; and placing apparently entire reliance on complainant's statement, urges that nothing can justify the shameful treatment he has received, and that he (the petitioner) 'has good grounds for believing that he would have shared the fate of Bhow Sindia, but for the accidental circumstance which pro duced his release.' II. -— Case 46. 1. The next case which was fixed for hearing, was that of Chimnaji Laksh- man Wagh, one of the followers of the late Khanderao Gaekwar. Qn the part of the Gaekwar, however, the Durbar Agents stated to the Resident, that this individual was, in consequence of some palace intrigue in which the ladies of the palace were mixed up, held in great detestation by the Gaekwar, who was very anxious that he should not be examined by the Commission. And to this request, as the man's grievance was like that of other servants of the late Gaekwar, the Resident assented. The complainant therefore, by the desire of the Resident, was requested to withdraw. In connection with this case, the Resident has quoted at length a petition made by this individual, which will be found in the proper place. HI.—Case 47. 1. The next case is that of Ghulam Kadir Karimula, brother of Munshi Habibula, who states that he served the late Gaekwar Khanderao and was by him liberally rewarded, receiving in perpetuity by sanad, a village, and other marks of His Highness' favour ; that immediately on the death of Khanderao Gaekwar, all the property granted to complainant by His Highness, as well as private property otherwise acquired, was at once confiscated by the orders of the present Gaek- a—45 1war and he himself kept under strict surveillance at Baroda for about nineteen months; and that at the expiration of that time, he went to reside at Ahmeda- bad, where he has since resided in a state of penury. ' 2 In reply to these allegations, the Durbar Agent refers to the explana- tion ffiven in the case of Munshi Habibula, (No. 45), and states that the allow- ances and property were attached for the same reason as those of his brother. 3 The Hesident of Baroda in his final statement, points out that this explanation is insufficient and unsatisfactory. lY^Case 48. 1. The complainant in this case is Eshwantrao Sakharam Mungekar, who states that he served Khanderao G-aekwar and his predecessor for twenty-five years, and that he received gifts from His Highness Khanderao, so that at the death of the latter, he possessed a large sum of money, as well as a State allowance of Es. 2,000 annually ; that immediately after Khanderao Gaekwar's death, he was placed under surveillance and all his property attached ; and, after six months of this surveillance, that he was taken to jail where he was confined for two and a half years, having only been recently released at the intercession of the Resident. Petitioner adds that the sentence of imprisonment passed on him was for the period of seven years, but he alleges that he is ignorant of the reason of his punishment. 2. The Durbar Agent states in,reply, that complainant was convicted of intriguing with Bhao Sindia, and was, on this account, sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, but was released at the request of the Resident; that his allega tions as to the amount he possessed at the late Gaekwar's death are not true, but that Bhao Sindia did give him large sums from State and private sources; and that it was for the purpose of recovering for the State what the complainant had improperly obtained from it, that his property, to the value of Us. 4,0u0, was attached and confiscated. 3. The Resident in his final statement, points out that this explanation cannot be regarded as satisfactory. V.— C 49. The complainant in this case is one Krishnaji Govindrao Jadav, who states that he was a servant of the late Gaekwar Khanderao, and at his death, was in possession of houses and a large sum of money ; that about six weeks after the late Khanderao's death, he was arrested and was imprisoned for nearly two years, all his property being confiscated, his release having been obtained only a short time ago, at the Resident's request; and lastly, that he is now with his family, penniless. 2. The Durbar Agent states in reply that petitioner was concerned in an attempt to burn down the Palace at Baroda, and for this crime, he was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. His property, which only amounted to Rs. 2,0u0 and not the large sum mentioned by him, was also confiscated. 3. The Resident in his final statement, urges, that as no judicial proceed ings have been produced, it may fairly be assumed that they were never held, and that in point of fact, ' the petitioner has been thrown into prison on a nominal charge, and has been detained there for several years pending the Maharaja s pleasure, the whole of the petitioner's very considerable property having been confiscated.' VI.— 60. The complainant in this case is one Masukh Narsidas, who states that he lOrmeily practised as a Vakil in Baroda; and in that capacity, by order of His xlighness the late Gaekwar, prosecuted certain persons who now hold high office*4. under the present Gaekwar. Shortly after the death of the late G-aekwar, peti tioner was arrested and confined for many months ; but the statements recorded against him, were not, he alleges, read over to him, neither does he know what they were. Subsequently, after about nine months' confinement, he was released on his son-in-law paying a fine of Rs. 15,000 on his account. A security bond was also taken to the effect that he would not return to Baroda or make a com plaint. Petitioner claims now from the Durbar, on account of his alleged wrongs, the sum of Rs. 45,000. 2. The Durbar Agent states in reply that complainant was fined Rs, 15,000 on conviction of several offences, the chief being a conspiracy charging Captain Salmon, the late Assistant Resident at Baroda, with taking a bribe ; that his allegations about the depositions on which he was convicted, are false, his own depositions having been corrected and initialled by him; that his property has not been confiscated but attached at his house, where he may come and get it; and lastly, that the security was taken to ensure his future good conduct. 3. The Resident of Baroda in his final reply, points out that the Durbar authorities have not produced the necessary evidence to support their defence, which they might have done, if the judicial proceedings had really been held, as alleged ; and relying entirely on the petitioner's statement, holds that he ' has a legitimate grievance and is justly entitled to damages in consideration of the great loss and injury which he has sustained.' VII.—Case iVo. 51. The complainant in this case is one Lakshmibae, widow of Malharbhao Shelki, who states that her late husband was for forty years employed under the Gaek- wars of Baroda; that shortly after the death of Khanderao Gaekwar, her hus band was arrested and taken away to prison, and all their^ property attached ; that about nine months after her husband's arrest, she was informed by a sepoy that he had died in prison, on which she went to fetch the corpse, when it pre sented a swollen and blackened appearance, and emitted an offensive smell. She states that the property confiscated exceeded in value a lakh of rupees, exclu sive of a village, and that she is ignorant of the cause of the treatment suffered by herself and her husband. 2. The Durbar Agent in reply states that the complainant's husband was in charge of the Jamdar Khana or jewel house; and on the accession of the present Gaekwar, an account of the jewels was demanded. This he did not find it convenient to give, so he and one Ghanu Wagli set fire to the jewel house in February 1871, by which a great quantity of property was destroyed. For this crime he was convicted and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment, and his house and property were confiscated. VIII.—Oase No. 52. The complainant in this case is one Bhagirthibae, widow of Ghanu Wagh, who states that her late husband was in the service of the last Gaekwar, and on his death, was possessed of a large sum of money and an Inam village. Shortly after the death of Khanderao Gaekwar, her husband was arrested, and all their property attached, and about five months after, she heard that her husband had died in prison, when she went to take the corpse away. It was black, and the people said her husband had been poisoned, but she does not know on what grounds they made this assertion. Amongst the property confiscated, ^ was^ a garden which was given by the Gaekwar to Balvantrao Eshwant, a high judicial officer. 2. The reply of the Durbar is similar in this case to the last, and need not therefore be repeated. As regards the garden which was taken away, it is asserted, that it was made at the Government expense, and the Government therefore resumed it, and transferred it to the supervision and care of Balvantrao Eshwant, one if its high officials.4 3. The Resident in Ms final statement in cases Nos. 51, 52, urges that if the defence of the Durbar was valid, the proceedings which convicted the petitioners of arson, would have been produced. He also points out the suspicions which are asserted to have existed that the two men came to their death unfairly, and urges in conclusion, that some sufficient maintenance should be secured for the two unfortunate women. IX.— Case 53. The complainant in this case isParvatibae, widow of Bhao Sindia, late Minister of His Highness the late Khanderao. She states that very shortly after the death of the late Khanderao, her husband was arrested and confined in their house which was placed under attachment, and all their property was at once taken possession of by the State. About five months after, her husband was removed to prison, whilst she and Bhao Sindia's other wife were placed under strict guard. This continued for some time, when she was taken to the Residency and subsequently to the Kailway Station, where the fares of herself and Bhao Sindia's other wife were paid to Bombay. She asserts that even a sum of a lakh of rupees, which had been deposited with the Bombay branch of the firm of Gopal Rao Myral, was withdrawn by the Durbar, and in short that she and her late husband's other wife have been left penniless. 2. The Durbar Agent states in reply that the conduct of the late Bhao Sindia was notoriously bad; that he, on various pretences, took away several sums of State money and ornaments, and failed to account for cash advanced from the State coffers, for conducting the various departments of the State; that the only way of recovering these outstanding balances, was for the State to attach his movable and immovable property, which it did, with the knowledge and concur rence of the late Resident, to the extent of Rs. 3,61,200, exclusive of the house. 3. The Resident of Baroda in his final report alleges that the property confiscated was much larger than is admitted by the Durbar, and recommends the case to the careful consideration of the Commission. X.— Case 54. 1. The complainants in this case are as follows Meru Gaddhu, Fateh- sing Bhaiji, and Jesing Jora, who state that they were orderlies under the late and present Gaekwar. They allege that shortly after the present Gaekwar ascended the Gadi, they were requested to state by some official servants that Bhao Sindia and others had got up a plot against the present Graekwar ; that on their refusing to _ perjure themselves, they were imprisoned until they paid a fine of Rs. 600, a period of about four months. 2. The Durbar Agent states in reply that the men were arrested because they were conspiring against the State, and dismissed the service. He adds that it is not true that they were fined. 3. The Resident in his final reply, urges that the statement of the complain ants is substantially correct, and makes some general remarks on the Durbar administration of justice. XL— Case 55. 1. The complainant in this case is one Ganpatrao Gangajirao who states ™ at he ^ as a Dur r servant for about 34 years ; that almost 'immediately after the death ot the late Khanderao Gaekwar, he was imprisoned and attempts were niaCo om uce nm to give false testimony against certain persons accused of a emp mg o set fire to a shed adjacent to the Palace ; that he does not know r- crime Y as 1 P 1 P u ted to him and that no proceedings were taken; and finally, that he was imprisoned for nearly three years, having only been recently released at the suggestion of the Resident,2. The Durbar Agent states in reply that complainant Was tried and con victed of setting fire to the Palace at Baroda, and sentenced to seven years' impri sonment. 3. The Resident in his final reply states that he has good grounds for believing that the charge of setting fire to the Palace is entirely false ; and if it had been true, it would have been very easy for the Durbar to have produced the proceedings of the trial. XIT.—Oase iVo. 56. 1. This Ko. contains the complaints of sixty-seven subordinate followers of the late Khanderao Gaekwar. In three cases, petitioners urge that their property has been confiscated and allowances resumed; in two cases their pro perty has been confiscated only; and in the remaining sixty-two cases, their personal and other allowances have been stopped. 2. The Durbar Agent states in reply that the property attached belonged to the State, and was therefore resumed, and the men were dismissed because they were merely personal attendants of the late Graekwar Khanderao, and their services were no longer required, as they did not possess the confidence of the present Gaekwar. 3. The Resident of Baroda urges that the property was private and not belonging to the State, and makes some general remarks on the wholesale dis missal of State servants by the present Gaekwar. G eneral O pinion and O bservations op the C ommission. There can be no doubt that the conduct of the present Gaekwar towards the servants and retainers of his late brother was of a most sweeping and vindictive character. But these persons, as is openly stated by the Durbar Agent, belonged to the party inimical to the present Chief; and it is further alleged that they grossly, in the day of their power, abused the trust imposed in them, and were, some of them, worthless, and some of them, highly criminal persons. These accusations the Commission is not in a position to examine with any chance of arriving at a definite decision; but in all probability, many of the complainants in this group were as worthless and arbitrary as some of the present officials are alleged to be. But be this as it may, the Commission is of opinion that the wholesale punishment, dismissal, and attachment of the property, of servants who enjoyed the confidence of his late brother, which took place immediately after the accession of the present Chief, were arbitrary, vindictive, and doubtless, in | many cases, wholly unjust. The Commission has failed in its endeavours to obtain some trustworthy information regarding the alleged attempt to set fire to the Palace, in connection with which, some of the parties in the foregoing cases are stated by the Durbar to have been criminally dealt with. The Durbar alleges that a full report of the circumstance was made at the time to the Resident, but if so, it is not now to be found in the Residency records. As regards the real value of the property attached by the Durbar in each of the foregoing cases, the Commission is unable to offer any opinion. 6—45 5SCHEDULE II. C ases 57, 58, 59, 62. Complaints of the arbitrary resumption by tbe Gaekwar's Government, without cause or reason, of Inam holdings and hereditary emoluments granted by his predecessors. Note. —Most of these cases are similar to the grievances of the bankers on the same subject, and this group may be regarded as a supplement to theirs. The statements of the complainants are summarised as follows :— 1. Complainant, a Sahukar of Baroda, states that in 1872, the present Chief attached, without any reason that he knows of, his Inam village, worth Rs. 1,200 annually, which was granted originally to his great-uncle Samal, head of the firm of Hari Bhagti, by the Peshwa, and which had been since held uninterruptedly by the family. The Sanad is deposited with Hari Bhagti, and complainant informed the Durbar that it was so, when he was directed to produce it. The Inam villages of the bankers generally were attached at the same time. Complainant asks that his village may be restored, 2. The Durbar Agent states that the grant of this village was made to the firm of Hari Bhagti when the State was in debt to it, and that now, the debts have been cleared off, there is no reason for continuing it. 3. The Resident in his final statement, dated 5th January 1874, urges that the grant was an hereditary one, and had no condition attached to it, and further that as it was assigned by the Peshwa, its attachment simply amounts to spolia tion. 4. The Sanad granting the- village in question to the original holder has not been produced before the Commission, but if, as stated by complainant, it was given by the Peshwa, the Claekwar's Government is clearly not warranted in re suming the village, excepting on special and adequate grounds. The Commission has already in the case of the complaints of the bankers of Baroda, recorded its opinion that the resumption of the Inam villages held by this class, under grants of previous Gaekwars, on hereditary tenure, on the ground stated by the Durbar, viz., the clearance off of State debts, is not justified by the terms of the grants. Complainant, a Shroff of Baroda, states that the present Chief deprived him in 1871, without any reason, of an Inam village of the annual value of Rs. 2,500, and apalki allowance of Rs. 1,392, which had been granted to his father many years ago by Seiaji Gaekwar. Complainant produces two sanads. That for the village, assigning it to him in perpetuity, is admitted by the Durbar Agent to be genuine: but that for the ' palki' allowance is demurred to, as not being an hereditary grant, and not having the Maharaja's signature, but only that of a V ahivatdar. 2. The Durbar Agent assigns the same reason for the resumption of the village and allowance as in the preceding case No. 57. I.— Case 11.— Case No. 58, a—57 13. The Resident in his final statement, dated 5th January 1874, expresses his hope that the village may be restored to complainant. 4 The Commission is of the same opinion as to the insufficiency of the o-round assigned by the Durbar for the resumption of complainant's Inam village as in the case of Hari Bagti's firm (No. 37), but the stoppage of the 'palki' 5 allowance seems to have been quite warranted. III.— Case 59. The complainant, Pat el of Baroda, states that the present Chief deprived him in 1871, without any cause or reason that he is aware of, of an Inam village of the annual value of Rs. 5,000, and a 'palki' allowance of Rs. 600 granted to his father by the late Gaekwar, Khanderao, and enjoyed by him, (complainant), since his father's death in 1863. Complainant produces separate sanads for both grants, assigning them hereditarily, and in perpetuity, (which the Durbar Agent admits to be genuine), and adds that the village has been given by His Highness Malhar- rao to Govindrao Mama, one of the Durbar Agents attending the Commission. 2. The Durbar Agent states that the village was held on service tenure, and it having been found after the accession of the present Chief, that complainant's father had been guilty of receiving bribes, and had caused extensive loss to the State in the works entrusted to him, he was deemed untrustworthy and unfit for further employ. The village was therefore resumed, and the allowance stopped. 3. The Resident in his final statement, dated 6th January 1874, remarks that the alleged frauds which formed the ground for the resumption complained of, were not discovered till 8 years after the death of complainant's father, and that the petitioner's chief sin appears to have been that he was in the enjoyment of favours derived from the late Maharaja. 4. The resumption in the ease of this complainant, appears to the Com- mission to have been a high-handed and arbitrary act on the part of the Durbar, and the ground assigned for it can hardly, under the circumstances, in the absence of a formal proceeding of enquiry into the alleged frauds, be accepted as a suffi cient justification therefor- IV.— Case 62. The complainant, a banker of Daroda, states that he was deprived by the present Chief in 1870, without any cause or reason that he knows of, (1) a torch allowance of Rs. 72, granted him by Anandrao Gaekwar ; (2), a palki allowance of Rs. 700, granted him in 1838 by Maharaja Seiajirao, and (3), his Inam vdlage of the value of Rs. 2,000 granted him by the late Gaekwar Khanderao. He has not produced the sanads for these several grants, but states he has them at home. Complainant's father had advanced Rs. 1,281-4-0 to the present Chief in 1865, on the security of a gold watch, and a bond for the amount, which, his father having died in the interval, he was required to give up on His Highness Malhairaos accession. He did so, and was refused repayment of the amount due by the Maharaja himself, 2. The Duibar Agent states that the torch and palki allowances were granted to complainant s father when he was Munim of Hari Bhagti's firm, and were resumed at the same time, and for the same reason, as the similar allowances enjoyed by that firm The Inam village was conferred in connection with his father s official post, as Mumm of the Sirsubah's treasury, and was resumed on his death Complainants story about the loan made to the present Chief on the security ot a watch is untrue.3 3. The Resident states, that the sanad for the village is an hereditary, and not a mere life one, and that the ground stated for the resumption of the allow ances cannot justify the measure. He remarks that it is significant that the Agent has simply denied the story regarding the loan made to His Highness on the security of the watch, but that he did not put any question to complainant on the point. 4. The non-production of the sanads by the complainant has rendered it impossible to form a trustworthy judgment in this case, but assuming that the Resident has verified the hereditary character of the sanad of the late Chief confer ring the village, the Commission is of opinion that the action taken by the Durbar towards the complainant in its resumption, has been, as in other similar cases, harsh and arbitrary. The Commission cannot form an opinion as to the stoppage of the torch and palki allowances, which would appear to stand on a different footing to that of the village. General Observations op the Commission, V. The Commission is of opinion that the proceedings of the Durbar towards the complainants composing this group of grievances, has been of an arbitrary character, and is calculated to occasion a feeling of uncertainty and anxiety amongst all persons of the classes concerned, holding hereditary Inams under grants from previous Gaekwars,SCHEDULE II C ase N o. 64. Question of prison reform generally in the Baroda State. 1. In liis remarks under this head in the above case, the Resident draws attention to the alleged practice of flogging women in jail, in view to its being ascertained from the Durbar Agent if it exists or not, and if so, what measures are proposed by the Durbar for adoption regarding its suppression. The practice can, it is stated, be proved to exist in the Baroda jail by the evidence of persons who have been confined therein, and it has also been shewn in the Visnagar and Patan torture cases as having occurred in those Districts. The Resident is of opinion that the Baroda jail should be again visited occasionally by himself and the Residency Surgeon, as formerly, and that the question of jail registers, subsistence allowance, &amp;c., should receive attention. 2. The Durbar Agent states that it is not customary to divest female pri soners of their clothes and flog them, and that any Durbar official guilty of such an act would on conviction be punished. It was customary to correct female prisoners, who refused to do the work allotted them, gently with a stick, but it was ordered to be discontinued two months ago. With regard to the Resident's suggestion that the Baroda jail should be occasionally visited by him and the Residency Surgeon, the latter officer has never been in the habit of visiting it, but the Resident has done so occasionally. The Agent adds that proper arrangements exist already regarding the maintenance of a register of prisoners, grant of subsistence allowance, &amp;c. 3. The evidence that has come before the Commission in this matter hardly supports the charge of the (i habitual flogging ' of women in the Baroda jail in an indecent or cruel manner, but there appears to be no doubt that female pri soners were liable to personal correction by being struck with a stick as admitted by the Durbar. This practice is stated to have been lately forbidden, and the Commission is of opinion that the Maharaja should be recommended to issue a general pro clamation, absolutely interdicting, under severe penalties, the personal ill-treat ment in this or any other way, of females, whether in jail, or before the courts or under examination by the police, and that a copy of such proclamation be for warded by the Durbar for the information of Government. With regard to the visitation of the Baroda jail by the Residency Surgeon and the Resident, the Commission does not feel called on to offer any opinion. It is not aware that such visitations by the Residency Surgeon are ever made elsewhere, and they would, it seems to the Commission, bear the appearance of an unusual and uncalled for interference with a Durbar institution. A Resi dent or Political Agent, however, is always at liberty to make them, on intimat ing to the Durbar that he proposes to do so, and as the Agent states this was formerly the practice at Baroda, there is apparently nothing to prevent its revival. When making such visits, the Resident could, if he deemed such advisable, always be accompanied by his Assistant, or the Residency Surgeon, -G4 IC ase N o . 65 of SCHEDULE II. and N o . 13 of SCHEDULE III. Complaints ofohstruction offered hy theGaehwar s to parties desiring to appear before the I.— Case No.65 1. Petitions from the ryots of Naosari Pargana, viz: (1). From 100 ryots to the Resident, dated 7tli November 1873, complain ing of the oppression practised on them by the officials of the Gaekwars Govern ment, through terror of whom they are afraid to come forward and state their grievances to the Commission, which they desire to do ; add that they have appealed to the Durbar, but have failed to get any redress. (2). From 22 ryots, (who had left their houses and come into British territory), to the Collector of Surat, dated 14th December 1873, stating that, because they went to Baroda and petitioned the Resident regarding the oppres sion practised on them, they were on their return informed by the local officials that they should in consequence have to go to the British districts, and that they were then subjected to such oppression in various ways, that they were compel - led to abandon their houses and crops and leave the Pargana. (3). From 3 ryots to the Resident, dated 2nd December 1873, complaining of the obstruction thrown in the way of those amongst them who desire to come to Baroda and give evidence before the Commission, several of such persons having been imprisoned to prevent their doing so. Petitioners allege that they had left their village secretly with this object, and solicit that the depositions of their grievances may be taken and recorded. (The statement of one of these petitioners, Shankraji Shivram by name, has been taken by the Commission and will be found in the file) . (4). From 26 ryots of 6 villages of the Balesar Pargana of Naosari to the Resident, date not given, representing that organized attempts are being made by the Durbar officials to prevent their coming to Baroda to lay their grievances before the Commission, and that they are compelled to sign papers prepared by these officials. Petitioners complain of the over-assessment imposed on them, and their poverty-stricken condition in consequence, and that they can get no redress from any quarter. 2. The Resident further refers to an arbitrary proclamation issued by the Durbar in August last, enjoining general abstinence from animal food, as indicat ing an intolerant spirit and desire to interfere with the civil liberty of other classes than Hindus. 3. Shankraji Shivram, one of the three petitioners referred to above under subhead (3), appears before the Commission and states, that 24 or 25 days previously, 94 ryots of the Naosari Pargana determined to make a petition to the Commission, but their intention must have been revealed to the Thana, for the night before they had arranged to start, sepoys were sent to all the villages, and some men were arrested. Four sepoys came at midnight to deponents village bringing 2 or 3 arrested ryots with them. Deponent managed to get away and has come to Baroda. The object of the arrests was to prevent their making their petition to the Commission. The petition of the 94 men referred to is with the Resident. Deponent adds that they had been previously oppressed by the levying of Nazarana, &amp;c. a—65 14. The Durbar Agent states that no order to stop petitioners coming up before the Oomniission has ever been issued, by the Duibar, nor has it any knowledge of any difficulty having been put in the way of their doing so. If such has been done, it has been so without the Durbar's sanction. When the Resident brought to the Maharaja's notice that he had received, a petition, stating that people were not allowed to come up to represent their grievances before the Commission, an order was issued directing the Vahivatdar to throw no obstacle in the petitioners' way. The Agent cannot say if the order was a verbal or a written one. 5. The case of the above petitions was only laid before the Commission by the Resident two days before it closed its proceedings at Baroda, and it had therefore no opportunity of holding an enquiry into the statements made in them further than taking the evidence of Shankraji Shivram, the only complainant who was in attendance for that purpose. The attention of the Durbar Agent was, however, at once drawn by the President of the Commission to the grave character of the complaints against the action of the Durbar officials made by the petitioners, and he was urged to lose no time in bringing the subject to the notice of the Maharaja, in view to the immediate adoption, under His Highness' orders, of such measures as might be necessary to remove any further ground of complaint on this score, and for the due punishment of any officials who had been guilty of, or concerned in, the conduct complained of. With respect to the object of the intended attendance of the ryots whose pe titions have been laid before the Commission, it is understood that their griev ances are precisely similar to those of the ryots of the Petlad and other Parganas, whose complaints have .already received the full consideration of the Commission, and as the group consisting of that class of cases had been already completed, the non-attendance of the petitioners has not been of any material consequence, and will not involve any inattention to their grievances on the part of the Commis sion. Indeed, looking at the excitement that has extended amongst the agricul tural classes, in connection with the assembly of the Commission, chiefly, appa rently, from a prevalent idea that the latter was going to take up the question of the land assessment, in view to a general reduction of the existing high rates so much complained of, the Commission is not disposed to regret that the petitioners in the present case have not come to Baroda ; but it is of opinion that the Dur bar should be required to state what haa^ been the result of the enquiry held by it into the allegations against is local officials in this matter, and what notice has been taken of their misconduct, if proved ; and the Resident has been addressed to this effect. II.—Case No. 13, Complaint of one Valli Tar Vakil, resident of Amreli Mahal, Kattiawar. 1. Complainant states that as Vakil for the Thakors of Manpur, it became is duty on various occasions to petition the Resident in their case, and, further, that on returning to Baroda he was in the habit of seeing the Resident daily. That snortly after his return to Baroda he was sent for to the Fouidari, when Balvant- rao Jishvant asked him if it were true that he acted as above. On admitting o points he was sent to the Court of Balvantrao Deo and Narayenbhai, who sentenceo him to ten years' imprisonment for so doing. All his Daftar and papers woie seize , e was released after 15 days at the instance of the Resident. On receiving back his papers, he found some missing. • n r ^ ie Fo ^d a r Balvantrao Eshvant, who is present as one of the members attendance on behalf of the Gaekwar Government before the Commission, states fif 16 com P am^nt was brought before him, charged with making improper t ) ost 1 f ^f a 1 ara j a ' and that after enquiry he sent the case up for dis posal to the Court of Balvantrao Deo and Narayenbhai.The Durbar Agent replies to the allegation of the deponent, that, on the information of one Mansnkh Garvar, to the effect that Valli Tar had preferred a complaint falsely calumniating the Durbar and its officers, and that the draft of it would, if hisjhouse were searched, be found, the Police were directed to make the necessary search, and that while examination was going on and deponent was under surveillance, the Resident interfered and procured the discharge. His pa pers were returned, but if any should have been kept back and can be found, they will be given back to him. The assertion that he was sentenced to 10 years' im prisonment is false. 3. In his final reply on this case, dated 6th January 1874, the Resident con tends that the complaint of gross ill-treatment of deponent by the Durbar officials for making representations to him must be accepted as substantially true, as the Durbar Agent forebore to cross-question him in the presence of the Commission. The Resident cites this and other cases as proofs that organized attempts have been made by the Durbar to deter petitioners from coming forward, and to terrify those who have already complained. 4. The admission of the Durbar Agent in this case appears to the Commis sion to show clearly that the Durbar desired to check the freedom of petition by their ryots to the Residency. In so acting, it was, in the opinion of the Commis sion, very ill-advised, especially with reference to the expectation expressed by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General in his Kharita dated 19th Septem ber 1873, to the Maharaja's address, that His Highness would afford to the Com mission every assistance in his power during the continuance of its investigations. The Commission cannot, on the simple statement of the complainant, accept, as proved, his assertion that he was informed that a sentence of 10 years' imprison ment had been passed on him, which is denied by the Durbar Agent, but it can have no hesitation in recording its strong condemnation of the Durbar s action towards complainant, under present circumstances, on the grounds stated by it. It is only necessary to add that the complainant in this case had no griev ance of his own originally to bring forward, but was employed in drawing up petitions for other parties, and he may have been viewed by the Durbar as thereby inciting complaints against the Maharaja, and therefore meriting punishment. 5. It is perhaps only proper for the Commission to record here in reference to this class of complaint, that, as indeed might be expected, the opportunity afforded by the assembly of the Commission has, it has been stated, been taken advantage of by many discontented or mischievous persons throughout the Baro- da limits, to urge the people to bring forward their grievances against the Gaek- war's Government, and that the knowledge of this fact has doubtless actuated the Durbar in the present case.SCHEDULE III. Cases Nos. 2 and 3. Claims of certain jewellers of Alimedabad on account of jewels sold by tliem to Maharaja Malharrao. The circumstances of these claims are set forth at length under the above cases in Schedule III., and are summarised as follows :— 1. Case No. 2. Complainant brought certain jewels, valued by him at 3 or 3lakhs of rupees, for sale to the Maharaja on the occasion of his marriage nearly three years ago. The jewels were placed in the Jamdar Khana for about a month, and complainant was then summoned, and informed that their value was estimated at about Rs. 2,50,000 to Rs. 2,60,000. After some discussion, the sum of Rs. 2,71,790 was offered to complainant, and accepted by him, and that amount was credited to his account, and a few days subsequently, orders for its payment were made out and signed by the Maharaja. The marriage had then taken place, and the jewels had been worn by the Rani. Complainant then went to get the orders for the money, but was told he could not receive the full amount, on which he stated he must either receive it or take back his jewels. He was told they could not be returned as the Rani had worn them. He afterwards heard that the orders had been cashed by Yasant Rambhao, who was in charge of the State Bank, and that the amount had been deposited by him at interest in the Bank. Complainant subsequently petitioned the Maharaja three times by letter, but without any result. Afterwards one of the firm visited Baroda, and presented a petition in person to His Highness, who referred him to the Dewan. The Dewan ultimately made three proposals, viz;— ((1). That two jewellers of Ahmedabad, and two of Baroda, should re-value the ornaments, and that complainant should accept the price fixed by them, without interest thereon, except for the first twelve months. (2). That complainant should receive back the ornaments, and that the Maharaja would pay any reasonable loss he had sustained by their retention by him. (3). That complainant should agree to receive the amount the Durbar may fix in full satisfaction of his claim. Complainant declained to entertain either of these proposals, and petitioned the Resident for redress, placing his claim at Rs. 2,71,799, the amount origi nally fixed, and Rs. 39,333 interest thereon at 6 per cent, per annum. 2. The explanation of this case given by the Durbar Agent and by the Maharaja personally to the President of the Commission is, that when the jewels came to be carefully examined after the marriage, with those purchased from other jewellers for the occasion, it was found that they were considerably below the value it was first proposed to put on them, and a fair re-valuation was accord ingly made of the whole, and the amount refixed offered accordingly to the several jewellers concerned, by all of whom the same was accepted, excepting complain ant and another Ahmedabad jeweller. It is denied that the return of the jewels to complainant was refused. On the contrary, the Durbar alleges that he was told to take them if he was not satisfied with the price offered for them.2 3 The Commission observes that the main facts in this case are admitted on both sides. The complainant no donbt regarded the transaction as concluded, but so long; as the orders for the price of the jewels were not delivered to him and actually cashed, the Durbar considered that such was not the case _ The Maharaja protests that he was deceived as to the worth ot the jewels, and was and is willing to pay their real value. No doubt the complainant has good ground for dissatisfaction at the non- settlement of his claim, and were both parties to the _ contract British subjects, he could probably sue His Highness successfully m a Civil court, but such delays and disputes are of common occurrence on occasions of the purchase of jewels of large value by Native Chiefs, and are well known to be so by the deal ers in such articles. Bearing this in mind, and that very extrav agant values are put on their jewels under such circumstances by Native jewellers, the Commission conceives that it would not be justified to take on itself the task of attempting a settlement of this case, for which a fair valuation of the jewels by well qualified and impar tial arbitrators would be absolutely essential, and it has therefore suggested that the jewels be forwarded to Bombay with proper precautions, through the Resi dent, for this purpose, and that His Highness agree to pay the full amount that may be so fixed on them, or to return the jewels if the complainant decline to receive the same, a reasonable amount being in either case paid to the latter as compensation for the delay that has occurred in the adjustment of his claim. The Maharaja having intimated his full readiness to accept and abide by this mode of settlement, the further disposal of the matter has been left in the Resident's hands. The Commission thinks that the two first modes of settlement admitted by complainant to have been proposed by the Dewan, but declined by the former, were not unreasonable, and that it is to be regretted that he did not accept them. II. Case No. 3. Complainant sent certain jewels shortly before the pre sent Maharaja's marriage nearly 3 years ago, to the Baroda firm of Bhaichand Vardhaman, which had asked him and others to supply some for sale on the occasion to His Highness. The jewels were taken to Baroda by his son, and were of the value of about 17 lacs of Rupees. About 12 lacs worth were select ed by the Maharaja himself, and their purchase by the Jamdar Khana Kamdar was ordered by His Highness. The price fixed on them was Rs. 11,91,047 and complainant's son requested that the amount might be paid to Gopalrao Myral, and that the receipt of Bhaichand's firm for it might be accepted on complainant's behalf. Gopalrao Myral was requested to receive the amount, and, after adjust ing a debt of Rs. 1,89,834 due to him by complainant in connection with this transaction, to pay the balance over to Bhaichand's firm, which was instructed to remit the same to complainant at Ahmedabad. The orders for the payment of the amount were drawn out and signed by the Maharaja, but fell into the hands of Vasant Rambhao, the manager of the State Bank, who cashed them and credited the amounts so realised in that Bank. Hearing this, complainant wrote to Bhaichand, who, on speaking to the Maharaja on the subject, was refer red by His Highness to this Vasant Rambhao, and the latter took a receipt, dated 1st July 1871, for the full amount of complainant's claim from the said Bhai chand s firm. Eight days later, Vasant Rambhao paid over Rs. 6,62,259 to (xo- palrao Myral, in part of the full amount due, and said that the balance should be paid up afterwards. Gopalrao Myral retained from this the sum due to him, and paid over the i emainder to Bhaichand s firm, as requested by complainant, of which he was duly informed by the said firm. Complainant then begged Bhaichand to get the balance and remit it, but on his applying to Vasant Rambhao for it, he refused to pay it. The amount paid to Bhaichand is still in his hands. Complainant has made no application to the Maharaja in the case.He claims now Rs. 5,28,788 the balance due on the above account with interest thereon. 2. The Durbar Agent furnishes the following explanation of this case. The ■jewels were of the alleged value of the amount claimed, viz., Rs. 11,91,047. They were purchased from the Baroda firm of Bhaichand Vardhavan through Gopal- rao Myral, and a receipt for the above sum in full was taken from the said Bhai- chknd Vardhavan. The transaction was wholly between Bhaichand's firm and the Sarkar, and Maganlal Hukamchand, the complainant, was no party to it. The receipt given by Bhaichand was for the full amount originally fixed by the seller, but on the jewels being subsequently valued, the valuation put on them by the jewellers, to whom the same was referred, was Rs. 6,62,259, which Bhai chand agreed to take, and an order for this amount was accordingly given to him, and was cashed by G-opalrao Myral whose Grumasta gave a receipt for the same, and in full of all demands on account of this transaction. Bhaichand's attempt to demand more from the Durbar on account of the original receipt is a fraudulent one. He is notorious for his treacherous deal ings, and it was in consequence of this that before paying the 6 lakhs odd to Gopalrao Myral, a receipt in full of all demands was required from the latter firm. Bhaichand's own receipt for the full amount is a sufficient reply on the part of the Durbar to Maganlal's claim. This Bhaichand is notoriously dis honest, and has embezzled Government money. In a personal explanation of this case to the above effect, given by the Maharaja himself to the President of the Commission, His Highness stated that the jewels in question were shown by him to the late Governor, in presence of the then Resident, Colonel Barr, on the occasion of His Excellency's visiting Baroda shortly after his accession, and that His Excellency then expressed the opinion that the price put on the jewels was most exorbitant, and far beyond their real value. 3. The whole question, according to the Durbar's view of it, as gathered from its explanation of this case, appears to hang on the authority of Bhaichand's firm to act as a principal in it, and whether the Durbar in good faith believed him to have such authority. On the former point, it seems to be clear that lie was only an Agent, and had no authority to accept, on the part of the complain ant, a smaller sum than he had agreed to take for his jewels. On the latter it appears to be impossible to believe that the Durbar was ignorant that the jewels were the property of the complainant, and not Bhaichand's, and that the latter could have no authority to agree to so large a reduction in the proposed price, without the specific sanction of the owner of the property. Under this view of the case, the Commission is of opinion that the settle ment, which the Durbar desires to adhere to, and force on the complainant, on the grounds stated by it, is not a justifiable one, and cannot be concurred in, as such, by it. The question in this case of the real value of the jewels and of the only course open for ascertaining the same in a trustworthy manner, appears to the Commis sion to be precisely similar to that of the preceding case in this group } and it has suggested it shall be dealt with in the same way. It is understood that some of the jewels have been broken up, but a sufficient portion no doubt still remaiins to admit of a just valuation being made of the same and a proximate one of the whole. The Commission sees no other method of dealing with the case without the risk of injustice to one party or the other. As remarked in case No. 2, if both were British subjects and amenable to a British Civil Court, the com plainant would probably be able to sue His Highness successfully, but as this is not the case, a compromise of some sort appears to be the only alternative.SCHEDULE No. III. C ase N o. 5. (Originally Scliedule No. I., Case No. 7.) The complainant in this case is one Balvantrao Ganesh, and his grievance is that the village of Dawat, Pargana Baroda, which was given to his father Ganesh Sudaseo by the late Khanderao Gaekwar as a reward for very distin guished services, has been attached by His Highness, the present Gaekwar. It seems that the village was granted to Ganesh Sudaseo in 1858, and that he enjoyed it up to his death in 1866. In the following year it was attached, on the ground that it was worth much more than lis. 10,000 at which nominal value it had been originally given. The attachment continued till Khanderao's death in 1870 ; and in 1871, His Highness the present Gaekwar, by the advice of Colonel Barr, restored the village to complainant, paying him, at the same time, Es. 30,000 on the assumption that Rs. 10,000 was the proper annual rental for each of the three years that the village was under attachment. The residue of the revenue for the said three years, amounting to Rs. 43,2o0'-15-0, the Durbar kept for itself. The complainant alleges that in 1872, the village was again at tached on the same plea, and that it is still under attachment. In support of his claim complainant produced before the Commission a Sanad, granting his father and his heirs for ever, the village in question, which was valued at Rs. 10,000, and spe cially declaring that whether the revenue realised became more or less, the differ ence was to belong to the grantees and not to Government. This document was not impeached by the Durbar. 2. The Durbar Agent states generally that the original intention was to give Ganesh Sudaseo a village yielding a rental of Rs. 10,000 only, which, at the time of the grant was erroneously supposed to be the revenue of Dawat; that the words 'be the revenue more or less than Rs. 10,000,' were improperly entered by the original grantee who was the minister of the Gaekwar at the time ; that other resumptions not very dissimilar, were not uncommon ; that His Highness the Gaekwar is willing to give complainant a cash payment annually of Bs. 10,000 or a village yielding that rental, in conformity with the original intention of His Highness, the late Gaekwar Khanderao ; and lastly, that the very village under discussion, was, in order that it might be available for the use of complainant's father, the original grantee, he then being Minister and presumably all powerful, resumed and taken from the possession of one Bahirji, to 'whom it had been grant ed in perpetuity. 3. The Resident in his final statement dated 30th December 1873, refers to some remarks made by Earl Canning, late Viceroy of India, who declined to guarantee on the part of the British Government, the continuance of the village in perpetuity as prayed'for by the complainant's father when the village was first granted to him by the late Gaekwar. The Resident further comments on the defence put forward by the Durbar. Opinion of the Commission. There can be no doubt that this village was granted by the late Gaekwar Khanderao, to Ganesh Sudaseo the complainant's father; and at the time of making the grant, there was an impression on the mind of His Highness, that the rental was about Rs. 10,000. But the words of the Sanad clearly prove that if the revenue a —5 12 exceeded that sum, the grantees were alone to get the benefit of the increase. Under these circumstances, looking at the case equitably, the Durbar would appear to have no right now, because the revenue has materially increased, to raise the objection which has been urged by their Agent, namely, that the words ' be the revenue more or less than Rs. 10,000,' were improperly entered in the Sanad by the original grantee, he then being as Minister, in a position to frame the grant, to the detriment of the State, unduly to his own advantage. But it should be borne in mind that the plea was primarily set forth, and the resurap. tion made by His Highness Khanderao, who originally conferred the grant; and that all that can be urged against His Highness, the present Gaekwar, is, that he will not undo the alleged injustice inflicted by his late brother.SCHEDULE III. Case No. 7. (Originally Schedule I., Case No. 2.) The complainant in this matter is one Bhanabhai Lalbhai, who alleges that he, about ten years ago, being a British subject residing at Bulsar, in the District of Surat, supplied stones for boundary marks to His Highness the Gaekwar's Government, and that notwithstanding repeated applications, he has not been able to obtain payment for the same. He adds that his Yatan was also attached in 1865 by His Highness Khanderao, the late Gaekwar. 2. The Commission on reading the papers and hearing the complainant's story from his own mouth, did not think that the investigation of such a case properly came within the range of duties entrusted to it. It pointed out, however, to the Durbar Agent that His Highness the Gaekwar ought to settle, as soon as possible, a matter which had been pending for so many years. 3. The Durbar Agent in answer to this stated, that the transaction referred to occurred in the time of the late Gaekwar, and that His Highness, the present Gaekwar, was quite willing to settle the case on an equitable basis, if the com plainant would attend at the Palace, and give all the explanation that was in his power. As regards the Vatan also, a promise was made that the facts should be enquired into, and the Vatan restored, if complainant was entitled to it.SCHEDULE III. Case No. 14. Representation by the Resident of the present state of the relations of the Gaekwar with the British Government, and the neighbouring States of the Rewa Kanta, Mahi Kanta, Pahlanpur, &amp;c. In the statement given under this head, the Resident draws the attention of the Commission to the great number of cases on various subjects now pending between his office and the Gaekwar's Government, and observes that it is quite clear that unless a very different mode of conducting business than that now followed by the latter is adopted, the just and equitable settlement of these vexed questions appears to be hopeless, and persons entitled to the protection of the British authorities must continue to suffer great loss. The Resident then quotes extracts from the Annual Administration reports of the Rewa Kanta and Mahi Kanta Agencies, in support of this view, as shew ing that the attitude and action of the Baroda Durbar and its officials for some time past have been unconciliatory and altogether wanting in a spirit of fairness and reciprocity ; that hence business is at a stand-still, and that the border coun try would be in a state of anarchy, but for the check imposed by the British Political Agents on aggrieved parties, who would otherwise attempt to take the law into their own hands. The Resident concludes thus—' In short, whether it is on behalf of Political Agents of Native States, or the Collectors of neighbouring British Districts, the Resident's advice tendered to His Highness the present Gaekwar according to Treaty has seldom, if ever, been followed, even though sound, just and friendly. Numerous instances of this may be quoted between 1871, and the present time. Hence business is at a stand-still and will remain so, until the whole system of Durbar administration is changed from what it is at present.' 2. The Commission has not had the opportunity of investigating any of the class of cases referred to in these remarks, and it is not therefore in a posi tion to pass an opinion on the wide general charge thus preferred against the Gaekwar's Government. It appears, however, to it that, if the engagements in force between the two Governments provide, as it is presumed they do, adequately for the settlement of such questions as those referred to, the existence of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs is a serious reproach to the British authori ties concerned, whose duty it was to hold the Gaekwar's Government to the due performance of its obligations under the terms of such engagements, and that it is impossible to avoid the impression that some share of the responsibility for the existing defects and want of proper system depicted in such strong terms by the Resident, should be laid to their neglect of their duty. 3. The Commission would further remark that a portion of the difficulties complained of may possibly be due to a too minute interference on the part of the Political officers concerned, in behalf of the claims or possessions of Mahikanta and Rewakanta Hakdars within the limits of the Gaekwar's jurisdiction^ The adjustment of such claims, &amp;c., elsewhere, under similar circumstances, is, as a rule, left wholly to the Native Government, and is not made the subject of inter ference by the British authorities. The Commission is not in the possession of the information required to enable it to judge if a contrary practice in Gujerat has aggravated the natural difficulties of maintaining good working relations with the Gaekwar's Government, in respect of these intermixed jurisdictions, but the point is one that appears to it to merit attention, as a constant inter ference by Political officers in such matters, where the right to do so, does not clearly exist, is at all times exasperating to a Native Government, and renders the maintenance of reciprocal and friendly relations with it, in the disposal of matters at issue in adjoining frontier districts, extremely difficult, if not im possible. a—14 1Report of Baroda Commission. APPENDIX B.SCHEDULES I., II, and III. Gases which have not been enquir I.— Case 'No, 11, The case of the complainant in this case has been dealt with by the Magistrate of Surat, with whom it lies to deal with the alleged unlawful seizure of complainant within his jurisdiction by Baroda officials. He has not appeared before the Commission, which was prepared to enquire into his alleged ill-treat ment at Naosari, it his claim to protection as a British subject was established. It is understood, however, that he has failed to establish such claim. II.— Case No. 7 In this case, complainant claims (1) the recovery of a sum borrowed by him at Surat, in order to fulfil his agreement with the Baroda Government, and (2), compensation from the latter for having been unjustly deprived of his contract. The case is also stated to include the claim of a certain widow to a refund of money paid by her late husband as bribes to certain persons. The Commission is of opinion that this is not a case in which it is in any way called on to interfere, and it therefore declines to take it up. III. — Case No.8 The complainant in this case claims compensation from the Baroda Govern ment for having been unjustly deprived of his property and forced to become security for the complainant in the preceding case. The Commission is of opinion that it is not called on to take up this case, and therefore decides not to do so. IV.— Case No. 33 There is, apparently, no complainant in this case to appear before the Com mission. Of the persons concerned in it, one is said to be the Maharaja's mistress, and the others, who are alleged to have been imprisoned, have been released from confinement at the instance of the Resident. The Commission after a careful consideration of the circumstances of this case, which occurred two years ago, is of opinion that it is not one that can be taken up to any useful purpose by it. Whatever injustice may have been committed by the Gaekwar towards any of the persons concerned, it is clear that the opportunity therefor was afforded by the irregular and illegal procedure of the Railway Magistrate at Bhosawal, and the neglect of the then Resident to require the re-transfer of the said persons to him, until a proper case for their delivery to the Durbar had been made out to his satisfaction. The Commission could only deal with the case by taking on itself the duty of now holding the enquiry which should have been held by the Resident, before formally authorizing the surrender of the accused persons to the Durbar, and this it does not feel itself called on, or competent, to do, V. — -Case No. 34 The complainant in this case, a palace 'loundi' in the service of the Rani, is stated to have been imprisoned by order of the present Maharaja, but without any judicial enquiry, for a year and a half, on a charge connected with an alleged palace intrigue. It is stated that she was further divorced from her husband, .and her father was fined Rs. 2,000 in connection with the charge against her. ]2 The Commission is of opinion that tto is not a case, m whmh an mvesti. ration by it is either desirable or necessary It is clearly one of a class in which no Native Chief with any pretension to independent jurisdiction would deem ,t necessan^ to hold a judi^l enquiry ; and the one-sided reports regarding which that may reach a Political officer-for no Durbar would enter into an explanation in sun case—are obviously untrustworthy The complainant has been released Lt the instance of the Kesldent. and the further interference of the Commmiou fn the case, would, according to its views, be both improper and objectless. VI. Case No. 36 The case of this complainant is similar to that of Ko. 3 4, and the Commis sion on the same grounds deems it unnecessary to investigate it. ihe com plainant has been also released. VII.—Case No. 38 This case refers to the death in prison, under circumstances which, it is al leged, have led to the popular belief that they were poisoned, of 1. Bhao Sindia, Ex-Dewan of the late Gaekwar Khanderao, 2. Raoji Master, Karkun in the service of Rani Jamnabae, the late Gaek- war's widow. 3. Ghanu 'Wagh, confidential servant of the late Gaekwar. 4. Malharba Shelki, ditto ditto. The suspicious circumstances connected with the late Bhao Sindia's death m May 1872, have been already the subject of report to Government, and of com ment by it. The Commission has not seen the depositions, on which the Resident records his opinion that he is in a position to establish the fact of the death by poison of Bhao Sindia conclusively, but it considers that it would not be justified in opening an enquiry in a case of this peculiar character, and of taking evidence on it in the presence of the Durbar Agents, until the full grounds on which the Resident proposes to bring it forward have been laid before Government, to en able the latter to judge if it should be entered into or not. In the present state of affairs and of embittered feeling at Baroda, such ac cusations, in the opinion of the Commission, require to be received with much caution, and to be examined impartially and dispassionately, before taking the final and grave step of making them the subject of actual investigation, in the form of a personal charge against the Ruler of the State, and the Resident was therefore at once recommended by the Commission to report the case fully to the Bombay Government without delay, and in the meantime, to take it out of the Schedule, for the present at all events, so as to let it remain in abeyance, without being forced on the Durbar's notice, till it was decided by competent authority, if the Commission was to take it up or not. VIII. — Case No,43 Complaint of Ganpatrao Gopalrao Gaekwar, claiming an increased allow ance and more consideration from the Durbar. On a consideration of the circumstances of this case, as set forth in the Sche dule, the Commission is of opinion that it does not fall within the scope of its 1!&gt; quiry, and it therefore decides not to take it up. It is further of opinion that any just claims on the part of the complainant, requiring the interference of the British Government, should be dealt with by t e Resident. IX.— Case No. 60 Complaint of one Narsibhai Ranchodbhai of Nariad, in behalf of the widows and daughters of the late Kisandas Vitaldas of Bakrol in Petlad.&lt;1 3 /.&lt;-J Complainant is married to one of the daughters of Kisandas, and claims on behalf of the above, and of his son Apaji, the issue of the said marriage, the restoration of Kisandas' estate alleged to be of the value of five lakhs of rupees, which he states has been adjudged, as heirless property, to one Lalu Tulsi, on his paying a Nazarana of Rs. 40,000 to the Durbar. This is clearly not a case that could be possibly investigated to any advan tage by the Commission, or with which it is called on to deal, and it therefore declines to take it up. X.— Case No. 63. Complaint of one Dinsha Darasha, Parsee of Surat, on behalf of the heirs of Manekbai, daughter of Mancharji Gadiali. The grievance in this case consists of the attachment of private property consisting of land of the annual value of Rs. 6,000, in the Naosari Pargana, belonging to the said Manekbai, which was attached in 1860 and finally confis cated under the orders of the late Graekwar Khanderao, in 1869, on the ground that the last legal holder of the same had left no heirs. Complainant claims the restoration of the said property to the heirs of the said Manekbai. This is also clearly a case which the Commission could not with propriety investigate, and it therefore declines to take it up. XI.— Case No.6 Complaint of Sukha Vahala of Nuldra in Naosari. The claim in this case is in connection with the attachment of the village of - Nuldra in Naosari by the Gaekwar's Government, in satisfaction of a demand by the Durbar against a third party, for whose non-payment of the same, com plainant states he is in no way answerable or responsible. The complainant in this instance is a subject of the Graekwar ^ his village is in Baroda territory ; its attachment has been ordered in connection with a security bond, admitted by complainant to have been executed by him in 1867, engaging to make good to the Government any sum that might on enquiiy be found due by a certain defaulting Revenue farmer, and there is nothing what ever in the circumstances of the case, as set forth in the Schedule, that appeal s to call for, or indeed to warrant, British interference. The Commission, therefore, sees no ground for entering into the case, which it would further be impossible for it to investigate to any good purpose. XII—Case No.8 Complaint of Jetharam Ochharam of Patan on behalf of his brother Fatteh- ram, late Foujdar of Patan. The complaint has reference to the alleged payment of a sum of Ks. 7,000 by the said Foujdar on his appointment, partly as a Nazarana to the Maharaja himself, and partly as a bribe to the Minister and Sir Foujdar. The person in whose behalf the complaint is made, has been recently con victed by the Durbar of torturing certain people, and has been sentenced to imprisonment. The Commission, while prepared to hear any representation from the Foujdar himself, deems it inadvisable to receive such complaints from a third party, and as the Foujdar has made no complaint, it declines to enter into this case. The Foujdar appears to have richly deserved the punishment to which he has been sentenced.4 XIII. — Case No,9 Complaint of Govindram Kasiram, late Foujdar of Kadi, The grievance has reference to the alleged payment by complainant of Rs. 3,500 as Nazarana to the Maharaja and Rs. 2,000 to the Sir Foujdar, for his appointment as Foujdar of Kadi Pargana, and of his having been subsequently deprived thereof without cause, his own house and property and his father's house in Patan being at the same time attached. Complainant claims to be re stored to his appointment, or to have the money so paid refunded to him. The Commission was prepared to hear complainant's statement of his griev ance, but as he has not attended to make it, it has been unable to do so. XIV.— Case No. 11 Complaint of Balvantrae Lakshman, Sayer contractor of Jerod. The grievance in this case consists of complainant's alleged deprivation of the Sayer contract of the Jerod Mahal on an insufficient pretext, and he claims its restoration to him. The Commission is of opinion that this is not a case into which it is called on to enquire, and it will not therefore be taken up. XV.—Case No. 12 o/ Complaint of Narayen Farsotam and others of the village of Sukra, Baroda Parganah. The particulars of this case, as set forth in the Schedule, having been consi dered by the Commission, it is of opinion that it is not one calling for enquiry at its hands or in which its interference would be warranted, and it therefore decides not to enter into it. X VI.— Case No. 13 Complaint of Thakor Dipsinghji and others of Amreli in Kattywar, repre sented ^y their Vakil, Valli Tar. The particulars of this grievance, as stated in the Schedule, have been care fully considered by the Commission, and it is of opinion that it is not a case re quiring enquiry at its hands, or into which it could enter with any advantageous result. It therefore decides not to enter into it. The Vakil s statement of the proceedings taken against him, in connection with this case, has, however, been heard by the Commission and duly dealt with, as will be seen from its proceedings under the same number.Report of Baroda Commission. APPENDIX C.F rom C olonel E. J. MEADE, c. President, Special Commission of Enquiry on Baroda affairs, To C olonel R. PHAYRE, c. b., Resident at Baroda. 1873. S ir, I have the honour to inform you that the Commission, recently nominated by the Government of India, to enquire into and report on certain matters connected ^^with the Baroda State, and composed as per Colonel R. J. M^ade^C. S. I. margin, has assembled at Bombay, and is Members, prepared to proceed with the duty for which The Honourable E. W.

S-1. i • , x V i-JUf ' cases, which are to be laid betore it tor en quiry. 2. It appears to me that the first step that should be taken before entering on the business of the Commission, is to define as closely as possible, the course we propose to follow, and the class of cases we From Government of India, Foreign be p re p are( i to investigate, as generally Department, to the iiombay Crovernment, 1 I • .i x i i. j • x 'u No 2209- p., dated 9th September 1873. described m the Despatch noted m the margin of which you have doubtless been furnished with a copy, and having consulted my colleagues on these points, I beg to inform you that we shall first take up and enquire into such complaints of British sub jects not already disposed of, as you may consider to be of a sufficiently grave character to demand investigation at our hands ; and when this portion of our work is completed, we shall be prepared to consider and deal with the cases of subjects of the Baroda State, or other persons not being British subjects, which you may deem it necessary to bring forward as proofs of general mal-administration, on the part of the Gaekwar s Government, threatening the peace of the Baroda State itself and the adjoining British and Native Districts, and affecting, or likely to affect, the existing treaty relations between the Gaekwar and the British Govern ment. 3. In respect of the first of the class of cases referred to in the preceding para., the Commission is of opinion that its enquiries should be strictly limited to grievances in which the principal concerned is a British subject, and, as such, entitled to claim the protection of the British authorities against the oppressive action or proceedings, which form the subject of complaint; and (2), that cases of a minor or petty character, the settlement of which should ordinarily and as a matter of course be disposed of by your office, should not, without some special reason therefor, be brought forward for investigation. 4. In respect of the second class of cases, the object in view is not the intended redress of individual grievances, but the establishment or otherwise of a sufficient number of instances of grave oppression or misgovernment, to enable the Commission to form an opinion as to the existence, as alleged, of such general mal-administration on the part of the Gaekwari Government as to imperil the peace of the country, and to affect the existing relations between His Highness and the British Government, and none but cases of a sufficiently serious character to bear clearly on the object of this branch of the enquiry, should, we consider, be laid before us for investigation. 1 b c 12 5 I have therefore to request that you will have separate Schedules pre pared of the two classes of complaint above adverted to, no cases being included therein except such as would have to be enquired into under the terms of tW preceding remarks, and that you will have the goodness to furnish the same to me at the earliest possible date. 6 As it is of importance that as little delay as possible should occur in the commencement of its work by the Commission, I trust that you will have a suffi cient number of the first class of cases, viz., those affecting British subjects, readv, to enable us to proceed with them as soon as the arrangements for the accommodation of the Commission at Baroda, now in progress under the orders of the Bombay Government, are completed. 7. It is only necessary for me to add, in reference to the complaints of British subjects that may be brought forward for enquiry by the Commission, that the right of the complainant in each case to the pi otection he claims as a British subject, should, we are of opinion, be duly enquired into and decided by yourself before such case is inserted in the Schedule. Without this precaution, complications and waste of time may occur which it is desirable to provide against. 8. Though the Commission is decidedly of opinion that it should limit its enquiry to cases of the description already adverted to, it will of course be open to you to lay before it separate supplemental Schedules of both classes ot cond- plaints, which, though not of a character to demand special enquiry, may yet be regarded by you as of sufficient importance, in support of the general allegations against the Gaekwar Government, to render it proper that they shall form part of the general case brought before the Commission. No complaints of a frivo lous, vexatious, or petty character should, however, find a place in these supple mental Schedules. 9. There may probably be some cases of a specially grave character, which, though not falling under either of the two classes already adverted to, may yet be of so serious a nature, as in your opinion to necessitate their being laid before the Commission, as part of the general subject for enquiry. If there are any such cases, it will be convenient that they be recorded in a separate Schedule for the consideration of the Commission, which will be guided by the merits of each such case as to the course it should take in dealing with it. You will doubtless give each case of this class due consideration before inserting it in the Schedule, so as to limit the entries in it strictly to such instances alone as ought clearly to find a place therein. 10. I trust it may be generally made known to, and be understood by, the persons complaining, or desiring to prefer complaints, against the Baroda Govern ment, that this Commission can receive no complaints direct, and that it is only empowered to enquire into, or otherwise deal with, such cases as are laid before it for that purpose by yourself as British Resident, 11. I will do myself the honour of forwarding in a separate communication, a letter to the Gaekwar's address, intimating to him the assembly of the Com mission, and the course generally we propose to adopt in carrvins' out the object of its deputation. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) R. J. MEADE, President of Special Commission. ^ The case of the Contingent will form the subject of a separate lettei.Report of Baroda Commission.

Maniklall Vithul. 2. His brother, Nanjee Vithul 8. His mother, Bai Judav. Transferred by order of the Commission.—Fidle Case No. I- Schedule III. The facts of this case are as follows :—On August 4th 1873 a petition was received from one Jurao, widow of Vithul Pana- chund, saying that her son named Maniklall Vithul, a Britisk subject and an inhabitant of Ahmedabad, who had come to Baroda for trading purposes, had been thrown into prison in Baroda on a false charge. The petition was accompanied DJ documents purporting to show that Maniklall Vithul was a British subject as alleged, and that he owned house property in Ahmedabad. A reference was thereupon made to tne Durbar, and a reply was received denying that Manik Vithul was a British subject, and forwarding depositions p® porting to prove that Maniklall Vithul was not a British W a Baroda subject. The petitioner was thereupon ( | liece to prove by further evidence that Maniklall Vithul was British subject as alleged in her petition. Eight deposiW recorded by the Police Inspector of Ahmedabad were warded to the Resident by the District Magistrate of abad, purporting to show that Maniklall Vithul was subject as alleged. A further reference was therefore to the Durbar, and all the papers in Maniklall s case^ 1 called for. The proceedings in the case were produced 0 1 the Resident on August 30th 1873, and Maniklall fl ab i leased on bail pending further inquiry. Maniklall has ^ at large on bail up to the present time. It appe ars ja^ SCHEDULE No. I— Complaints of British subjects. Remarks. the proceedings recorded by Bulwantrao Yeshwant, Fouzdar, that Maniklall Vithul was convicted of writing in Baroda a defamatory letter addressed to his brother Nanjee Vittml in Ahmedabad, and was sentenced to one year's rigorous im prisonment. The date of this sentence purports to be June 6th ? 1873. The trial of Maniklall Vifchul for the alleged offence took place in the month of April 1878; and Maniklall Vithul was actually imprisoned in that month, i.e., about a month and a half before any sentence was recorded. Maniklall Vithul swears that the charge of writing to his brother Nanjee a defamatory letter is absolutely without any foundation. Nanjee himself swears that he received no such letter in Ah medabad, and states that on prof erring himself for examina tion on hehalf of his hrother, his evidence was rejected hy the Fouzdav. Maniklall further swears that the statement in the case purporting to have been made by him and to have been signed with his own hand, was never made.by him at all, and that the signature in question is a forgery. He fur ther swears that no evidence was recorded in his presence, and that no questions were asked him relating to the charge against him. Maniklall was told by Bulwantrao Yeshwant himself four days after he had been taken off to jail that his sentence was 14 years' imprisonment; the same imformation was given by the Fouzdar to Maniklall s mother, Jurao, who visited the Fouzdar at his own house. The sentence recorded in the proceedings is one year only. There are circumstances connected with this case as well as collateral evidence which, it is right to state, are in favour of the probable truth of the statement put forth by Maniklall that the charge is a false one got up against him by the complainant, TJmr atlaJ_, owing to a quarrel between them, and that he never made the confession attributed to him. In the first place the evidence taken at Ahmedabad regarding Maniklall's claims to be a British subject appears to establish that fact, and if the Durbar had no doubt of Maniklall being a Baroda and not a British subject, and that as such he had made a full confession of his^ guilt on the 11th April 18/3., why should they, contrary to ordinary custom, have gone to J •fvrmnio nt hnn(T_ 1. In tlie flogging case {Vide No. 39 of Schedule II.) four tnen were con demned to imprisonment for life on their alleged confession ; three did not confess, but were imprisoned. 2. In the Patton torture ease (Nos. 9 and 10 of Schedule II.) men were flogged to make them confess. 3. The Amba Tanee case (No. 33 of Sche dule II.) also affords valuable evi dence on these points. Vide the. statements of Amba Kashee, Bul wantrao Sagurkur, and lihagwanta Gurud. the trouble of bring ing nine witnesses from Ahmedabad to prove what they state they were already con vinced of. The cases margin ally quoted, as well as others that might be cited, show that men are condemned even to imprisonment for life on their own con- fessions, and also that torture by flogging, &amp;c ; , is resorted to, to extort such confessions in Gaekwar territory; also that confessions never uttered are recorded against accused per sons; consequently that there was no necessity, according to ordinary Gaekwar procedure, to send for these nine witnesses to Ahmedabad; and that these witnesses allege that a crime has been committed in Ahmedabad by Maniklall sbiother, Nanjee. Seven out of the nine are goldsmiths ; the other two are one a Brahmin, the other a Koonbee.SCHEDULE No. I— of British Subjects. Remarks. They however prove nothing against Maniklall, against whom there is no evidence whatever, except his alleged confession, which he denies having ever made. Maniklall's statement on oath before the Assistant Resident is as follows :—Maniklall Vithul Sonee, aged 22, residing in Ahmedabad, on solemn affirmation saith :— I am a British subject. I live in Ahmedabad, and have a shop there where I carry on business of a goldsmith. I come to Baroda occasionally on business; and I have a house in Baroda. I was 4 or 5 years of age when I went to Ahmedabad; since that time I have only remained in Baroda for a period of a few months at a time. My father and grandfather were Baroda subjects, and servants of the Durbar. I have been a British subject from my childhood and have no connection with the Durbar in any way. The deposition which I now hear read to me and which is , 1 i - i - i . i Shravan Pnd 14t;h -i i „ signed by me and dated August 7th im, i5 as ^ade under the fol lowing circumstances : I was in the jail and summoned from thence to Fouzdaree by a sepoy, I went to the Fouzdaree early in the morning, and there the deposition produced was shown to me by Chaganlall^ Karkoon under Bulwantrao Yeshwant. Chaganlall was then alone in the Fouzdaree. He showed me the deposition produced and told me to sign it. I did not know what was written in it, and I refused to sign. Ghaganlall then ordered a sepoy to beat me until I signed. I received two blows and then I said that I would sign the paper. It is falsely stated in that paper that I have lived in Baroda from my birth upwards. I have always lived in Ahmedabad. Of the foxir witnesses who have given evidence regarding my being a Baroda subject, Zulloo Ramjee is employed under IJmratlall, my opponent, and Madhoo Rama and Mathoora bin Nana Shett were both in his service_, and Bhoodur Shun- kar was a tenant of his. All. of these witnesses gave evidence in order to assist Umratlall Dyaram. None of them gave evidence in my presence regarding me. Bulwantrao Y esh- want was not present when I was examined. I did not write to my brother Nanjee in Ahmedabad any Ut ter saying that H. H. the Maharajah had carried off the daughter of Umratlall Dyaram in Baroda. TJmratlall Dy aram s statement on this point is wholly false, and my brother Nanjee will corroborate me on this point. I am oo bad terms with Umratlall Dyaram, and he has therefore juali- ciously got up this case against me. Narayenrao Wakuskur ^keel has got up this case with Umratlall in order to ruin me. The Maharajah s name was introduced by Narayenrao in order to make the Durbar take the case up. Umratlall brought this false charge against me in the month of April 1873. I was summoned by a sepoy to the Fouz- daree,^ and I was then asked by Chaganlall whether I knew anything about a certain girl named Gunga. Umratlall was then in the Fouzdaree, and I understood 0 Chaganlall to refer to Umratlall s daughter, Gunga,. I was then taken away to a police station where I remained four days. I was then brought to the Fouzdaree. No evidence was recorded in my prescncG and no questions were asked me, I was told to write some-Y Lj / / SCHEDULE No. I— Complaints of British Subjects.

Four days after I was taken to jail, I was told hy Bulwant- rao Yeshwant that my sentence was 14 years' imprisonment, I do not understand how it comes to pass that my sentence is entered in the proceedings as one year only. My mother, who was with me when I was arrested, knows that I was sen tenced to imprisonment for 14 years, and not for one year as is stated in the proceedings. ' I was taken off to prison in the month of -Iprii « I do not understand why the decision in my case was only record ed June Qth, 1873. I was not present before the Fouzdar, and formally charged by him on June 6th, 1873. I was then in prison and had been in prison about a month and a half.^ (Forwarded to the Commission on the 12th December 1873.) R. PHAYRE, Resident. The following statement has been made by the petitioner:— ' I am a British subject residing at Neriad. I went to Jugral, in Button, to see some relatives. I was arrested by Fut- teyranv, Fouzdar of Putton, in connection with an alleged charge of theft. I was severely flogged in the Kutcherry for the purpose of extorting confession of a crime which I never committed. No stolen property has been recovered.'' From this and other cases that have occurred and are at present taking place in the Nowsari District of the Gaekwar State [vide case No. 65 of Schedule II.), the Durbar officials there, who are represented as being generally speaking the relatives and friends of persons in power at Baroda, seem to be determined not only to defeat the ends of justice, but to frus trate the object of the Commission of Inquiry as much as possible. I find from my records that on the 11th of August, I forwarded Bapoojee Cursetjee's case to Mr, Hope, the Magistrate of Surat, in which were included such papers as the Durbar had to bring forward relative to his claim to be a British subject and his seizure in his house situated within British territory. Owing to some obstacles which have been unaccounted for, the complainant, Bapojee Cursetjee, and his friends, did not appear in the Magistrate's Court as ordered by me ; and it was not till the 18th September that I received the prima facie case from Mr. Hope, who requested me to move the Durbar to surrender to the Magistrate, Manajee, the Fouzdar of Now sari, and Ruttunjee Framjee Daba^ also of Nowsari, and cer tain peons of the Nowsari Tanna, against all of whom a prima facie case of unlawful seizure from British territory had been mad^. out; also that as the above persons were appar ently acting under the orders of the Soobha of the District, Narayenrao Rugoonath, the request was preferred that ; he might be suspended from office as an abettor of this unlawful seizure Ift 2 G R / ZSCHEDULE No. I— Complaints of British Subjects. Eemaeks. I forwarded these requests with the prima facie case to the Durbar on the 19th September 18/3, and as I had not re ceived any reply by the 7th of October, and every one was put to the greatest inconvenience by the unaccountable delay^ I was constrained to write on that date to the Durbar, that if the 'prima facie case and reply thereto were not forwarded to me within 24 hours, I should be obliged to report the whole matter to Government for orders. I had already shown good reason to the Durbar why the Soobha, Narayenrao E;Ugoonath_, should be suspended, it having come officially to my knowledge that this was not the first time that he had been engaged in acts of violence as a Magistrate. In reply to this the Durbar ordered the Fouzdar and others to be sur rendered for trial but declined to suspend the Soobha. On the 11th October I replied asking a as an act of justice and friendship ?, that the suspension should be carried out. I have not received any written reply to this yad. I have been told verbally that the man has been suspended, but whether or no, his opposition does not appear from the Magistrate s next letter to have ceased. Case of Narungee alias Venoo, wife of Vithoba Polekur, resident of Khanoul, Taluk a Rajapur, Ratnagiri District' a British subject. On the 2nd instant, by desire of the Commission, I wrote to ask what judgment had been passed in the case in order that it might be recorded in the proceedings of the Commission. Mr. Hope forwarded Mr. Ollivant's replyyNo. 141^ dated 8rd instant, informing me that the case had been adjourned to the 11th instant, owing to the alleged illness of two important wit nesses, one of whom, though a Nowsari mam, was at present in Baroda^, alleged to be too ill to move, and consequently that the case could not be adjourned much longer. It was added by the Magistrate^ ' the Nowsari officials have not, I think, done their best to assist the present investigation, but have rather been inclined to regard themselves as parties for the defence.' Subsequent references show that the two witnesses now in Baroda still plead that they are too ill to appear, and Mr. Hope has this day (20th December) been informed accordingly. With regard to the question whether Bapoojee Cursetjee has produced proof of his being a British subject, the Magistrate; Mr. Ollivant, expressed the following opinion in forwarding the prima facie case in September :— 'I have some doubts as to whether the complainant (Bapoojeej Cursetjee) can establish his claim to be a British subject.' Since that the question has not been entered upon; it is there fore still undecided, but the conduct of the complainant sub sequent to his statement before me in August last appears to be so unsatisfactory, as to suggest doubts whether his origH ia ' intention of prosecuting his case with vigour has not been influenced in a manner calculated to defeat the ends ot justice.

Evidence showiog how young women are enticed away from their homes in British villages and made to serve as lowndees in H. H. the Maharajah'i household. The Resident has long since been aware of the existence of this practice, but has never before been able to obtain authenticated instances of it. In these instances the Minister and the Maharajah appear to be directly con cerned. The enticement, the forced service, the unjust imprisonment for not giving false information, their non-trial, the flogging, and lastly, the accidental release from prison, are matters that de mand the fullest possible investigation. Case of Saloo, wife of Gunoo Savai, resident of Sakurpa, Purgunna Rajapur, District Ratnagiri, a British subject. * These two men and the woman are alleged to have been in the service of the Minister Nana Sahib. a I married my husband Vithoba about 10 years ago. He is a cultivator and resident of Khanoul_, 4 kos from Bhalval, where my grandmother resides. I used to live with my husband. About two years ago I was at my grandmother's, when a servant of Nana Sahib Khanvelkar, named ^ Babajee JBedkur, came to me and induced me to accompany him to Baroda^ saying that I should be in easy cir cumstances there and should not have to work hard in the field as at Bhalval, and that I should get ornaments^ cloth ings &amp;c. I secretly left my mother s house, leaving a son of one year of age behind. At first I was taken to Kud^ the native village of Nana Sahib Khanvelker. Tvjo other women had already heen brought there and two came up two days subsequently. All five of us were concealed in Nana Sahib's house. The names of the other four were Muthoo, Sukoo, Kashee, and another Kashee; three days afterwards we left for Baroda^ the said Babajee Bedkur accompanying us. We stop ped in Bombay for three days; a sixth woman, named Door- gee, joined us at Bombay. All these women were between 20 and 25 years of age. From Bombay we came by rail to Baroda, and were taken to Nana Sahib's house. I remained in Nana Sahib's house for about a month; so did the other five. I was then sent with the others, except Kashee, to the Sirkar Wada^ and we were made to serve the Ranee Mahasabai as ' lowndees.' I remained in the Ranee^s service for four months when I was sent for by the Maharaja Mulharrao. Saloo and Tanee, women who were in the Ranee's service, were also there. The Maharajah asked Saloo and Tanee what they knew regarding a certain intrigue alleged to have occurred about that time. They replied in the negative. I was asked no questions. We were then sent to the Fouz- daree. This was at midnight. The next day art noon we were sent to Ravpura Chabutra. One and a half months subsequently I was sent to jail. There I remained for about 15 months, and was released on the occasion of the last eclipse of the moon. No trial has ever taken place, nor has my statement been ever taken down. r&lt;r I was twice flogged in the jail by Bhoojungrao^ Deputy Jailor, with a cane on my bare back. It is the common practice to flog women in the jail. I saw several women beaten in the jail. ' I have lost my caste and am now utterly destitute.

All five of us were taken to the Devan Nana Sahib's house, where we remained for one month. We were then taken to the Sirkar Wada, and made to serve the Ranee Mahasabai as ' loundees.' I served the Ranee for five months. 1 remember Narungee, Muthoo, Kashee, Sukhoo, and Doorgee coming to the Ranee's residence to serve as ' loundees.' After I was five months in the Ranee's service I was sent for by H. H. Mulharrao at night-time. Narungee and Tanee were also there.

This complaint will give a full insight into the farming system, with its attendant evils as practically carried out by the Gaek war Government. Correspondence will also be produced which took place in April, June, August, and September last regarding the state of affairs in this purgunnah generally. This case is one out of several that have lately come to light, showing that although farmers of the Mahals pay large sums to the high officials of the State by way of bribes^ yet that no faith is kept with them, and that they are liable to be turned out of employment without having committed any fault. Moreover, that the bribe given, and in some instances the security deposited, are not returned. This case shows the malversation and gross cruelty that has recently been practised in the Visnagar Purgunnah. It is feared that such practices have been too common in the Gaekwar districts; and that they have only been brought to light owing to the present system of the Resi dent hearing important complaints and referring them to the Durbar for explanation. 132 persons appeal against the oppressive land assessment, &amp;c., and the forcible means used to collect it, &amp;c., &amp;c.

State that in Sumvut 1920 ( a. D . 1863-64) the system of fixed money assessment was introduced and a settlement was made for ten years; that in Sumvut 1925 (1868-69) the Durbar measured the land with a short measurement and thus increased the assessment; that some villagers deserted, and were brought back by the Wahiwutdar on the assurance that they will not be made to pay assessment for unculturable land; and that a bamboo of 14 haths will be adopted as the standard measure ; that this promise has never been acted up to, and the writing containing the assurance has been taken away from them ; that on their expressing their wish to desert their villages they were put into irons and only released on their giving security that they will not desert their villages, and pay the assessment; that His Highness Mulharrow has sent as Wahiwutdar a man of his private ^Mundlee,' named Tatyajee Mahadev, who has made some new demands^ &amp;c.

The petitioner complains that his father settled nearly all the villages in the four Mahals in the year Sumvut 1864^ and that the assessment was then fixed at a certain rate, payable partly in cash and partty in coin, The assessment so fixed was in force for about 60 years, but in the year Sumvut 1920 ( a.d . 1863-64) it was considerably increased without any reason whatever. Petitioner also complains of the Gadi Nuzerana cess, and states that 300 families have deserted to the Junaghur State in consequence of the oppression to which they are subjected.

They assert that all the local officials have paid Nuz'erana for their appointments and have to recoup themselves from the ryots. They complain of the weight of the assessment and pray that it may be reduced in consequence of the fall in prices. They also complain of the Gadi Nuzerana and of the Inam Commission cesses, and assert that persons have commenced to desert their villages. It seems important to bring to the notice of the Commission, with reference to the alleged oppression and misrule in the Gaek- war State, that it has been the subject of correspondence with Government since 1867-68, and that in November 1870 the Government of India forwarded an anonymous petition from the oppressed ryots of all the Mahals of His Highness the Gaekwar's territory to the Bombay Government, with the fol lowing remarks a Although the petition is anonymous,, His Excellency in Council would be glad to be favoured with the opinion of the Bombay Government whether there is reason to believe that there is any, and, if so^ what degree of truth in the statement which it contains.' The revenue complaints now submitted embrace the period referred to in that peti tion, which was sent to Baroda about the time of His Highness K.hunderow's death ; they also embrace the period from November 1870 to the present time. In reply to the Bombay Government letter No. 3107, dated 7th October 1870, on this subject, inquiring whether the ryots suffered any oppression under the then system of Government, Colonel Barrreported as follows :—^That he had in vain endea voured to discover whence the petition then returned, purport ing to be from the ryots of His Highness the Gaekwar, had emanated, nor from close inquiry had he any reason to believe that they (the ryots) suffer oppression generally under the present system of Government/ ,14 SCHEDULE No. General attachment of Wuttuns through out the Baroda State, 1.

E bmarks. It is believed that para. 5 of the opening statement of ^ Schedule states in general terms the revenue grievances of the ryots ; but that without detailed inquiry by a special ofificGr will be impossible to arrive at the real merits of the case. | The Revenue Sir Suba, Hurriba Gaekwar,andhisDeputy,Narayen. bhai, have, it is believed, conducted the administration of this department for the last 8 or 10 years. The latter was formerly in the service of the British Government under the Rewa Kanta, and the circumstances under which he left the British service in connection with charges of bribery brought against him, can be brought forward. He has a residence in British territory at Nariad and is the popularly reputed possessor of great wealth. A correspondence will also be produced regarding the non-employ, ment of Hurriba Gaekwar, in consequence of his connection with certain intrigues in Calcuttta. The subject of the general attachment of Wuttuns, and in many instances the confiscation of Inams, Jagheers, and other hereditary property belonging to the various classes in the Baroda State, has on many occasions been forced on the notice of the Resident in connection with numerous cases that have been brought before him, a few examples of whicli are given in the margin. The general attachment of Wuttuns, which is notorious, has been in force for the last 8 or 10 years. It was resorted to pend ing an inquiry, which however has never been carried out The Minister, who, on my speaking to him on the subject, admitted the fact, stated that in many instances sums for marriages and such like expenses have been granted to Wut- tundars; he informed me however that now, on my repre sentation, all Wuttuns had been released from attadiment pending inquiry, and the copy of an order to this effect has been produced before the Resident by the Agent of one of the Wuttundars whose Wuttun has been under attachment for the last 10 years. The subject being considered one of very great importance, as a specimen of unjust administration, owing to the promised inquiry not having been instituted, and the Wuttuns virtually confiscated, a Yad was addressed to the Durbar, No. 2778, of November 18th, requesting, with reference to the Minister's verbal representation—(that orders had been given to release the Wuttuns from attachment,) that a copy of the official instruc tions on the subject which had been issued by the Durbar might be furnished to the Resident, who proposed to bring the subject to the notice of the Commission for the purpose of ascertaining the exact facts of the case, it is submitted that this general attachment of wuttuns and the Gadi * Nuzerana tax form subjects of real and universal griev ance throughout the State. It is strange that the late Colonel Barr mentioned neither of the^e heavy burdens in his admii^' tration reports for either 1871 or 1872. In paragraph 26 oi the latter he refers to the restoration . of certain allowance 8 under the head of Devusthan, which had been discontiniied or 3 years ^ before, the attachment of which had .caused ' universal distrust' under fear that confiscation was intende J but he omitted the larger question of Wuttuns, Inams, Jag^M &amp;c. He speaks indeed of an Inam village having been res ^ 01 A I by the present Gaekwar to Gunnesh Sudashiv, together w# its full emoluments, for services during the mutiny, and pra 1 ^ , His Highness for having done this act of justice ; but I ie ° re I to say that the promise made to Colonel Barr has not bee | performed, and the point which Colonel Barr especially ^ | tended for was withdrawn directly he left Baroda./y 15 SCHEDULE No. Complaints of Baroda Subjects. R emarks. Case of Amba, Tanee, Balventrao Sa- gurkur, (a foreign subject), and Bhug vunta Guruv. The facts of this case are, as follows : In the month of November 1871, a woman in the service of the Gaekwar, named Amba, accompanied by her daughter, Tanee, and 2 companions, named Bulvantrao Sagurkur and Bhugvunta Guruv, and others left Baroda with all their property intending to proceed to Cen tral India. Their object was to better their circumstances at Scindia's Courts but no sooner had they departed, then a Baroda Dur bar Karkoon was sent in pursuit. He followed them as far as Nasik^ where he obtained information that they were then at Bhosawul, in Khandesh. He thereupon tele graphed to the Police Inspector telling him that the four persons above mentioned had stolen Baroda Government pro perty and should be arrested. Information was at the same time feent to the Deputy Minister at Baroda to move the Resident to apply for the surrender of the accused persons. The Resident thereupon telegraphed to the Railway Magistrate of Bhosawul to detain Amba and whereas the Railway Magistrate replied by letter saying that four persons instead of these two had been forwarded to Baroda and surrendered to a Durbar official. On the receipt of the Railway Magistrate's letter Colonel Barr called for the prima facie case, and sent for all the witnesses. The first was sent; but the witnesses were never sent. It is important to notice that the* surrender of the accused per sons to an officer of the Baroda Durbar was wholly illegal^ and under the circumstances most improper. Under no cir cumstances had the Railway Magistrate authority to surrender accused persons to any Native State for trial. No prima facie case had been submitted to the Railway Magistrate ; no reference was made by the Railway Magistrate to the Resi dent before surrendering the accused. The four accused per sons were simply handed over to a Durbar Karkoon on his own . . statement, without any legal justification whatever, by uhe Daibarto impiisonment for 14 prima facie case submitted by the Durbar speaks for itself. Another instance of illeg^al surrender is shown in case No. 14 of Schedule I., in which Gopaldass Salekram^ of the Kaira village of Neriad, was handed over by the Deputy Collector^ Ahmedabad, to the Durbar Police a short time ago, and was thrown into prison in Baroda, and only released on the demand of the Resident.. Also the case of Manecklall Vithul, a resi dent of Ahmedabad^ who was sentenced years on a charge of writing a defamato ry letter to his brother in Ahmedabad, Vide case No. 9^ Schedule I. In the case of Nuthwa Tisla, No. 5 of Schedule I., illegal bail was exacted from a Maheekanta subject to compel his appearance before a Baroda Court. The two first instances mentioned show that the Durbar possess some indepen dent means of obtaining British subjects from British territory, otherwise than through the proper channel. The extent to which this evil exists is unknown to the Resident^ but it is quite impossible that the relations be tween the two States can be on healthy footing whilst instances of this sort can occur. There is also the case of the Parsee^ Ba- pujee Cursetjee, seized by Durbar offi cials in Surat territory, which is still pending in the Surat Magistrate's Court, Vide case No, 11, Schedule I. The whole case appears to have been got up on the complaint of the girl, Kasee-, the foster daughter of Amba. Kasee has however appeared and stated that she never made any com plaint at all. The depositions submitted by the Durbar purport to have been taken before the Fouzdar, but they are unattested by him, and the accused persons state that no in vestigation of any kind was made, and that the depositions in their respective names are in fact forgeries. It is also a most significant fact that in the prima facie case submitted by the Durbar, Tanee, the chief offender^ if any offence was commit ted at all, is not even charged, but her own father, Nimbajee^ is taken to jail in her place, whilst the daughter is taken to be the mistress of the Maharajah. The entire case is one of considerable importance ; it affords a specimen of deliberate abuse of power on the part of the Dur bar, against four innocent persons; one of whom (the father of the girl Tanee) has died in prison ; and three of whom have undergone imprisonment for lon^ periods without any hind of trial or any charge whatever. The last two persons (one 0/ them a foreign subject) where only released on the interposi tion of the Resident. These^ as well as Amba, have been plundered of a considerable amount of property. The possession of the girl Tanee was the primary object in view, and in order that this possession might be interrupted as little as possible^ the girl's natural guardians, her own father and her foster mother Amba,were thrown into prison pending the Maharajah's pleasure.ComplaintB of Baroda Subjects. 16 SCHEDULE No. E emaekb. 34 Case of Tanee, the daughter of Luximun Rao Gooptay. Case of Fakeer Shaha Saheb and Pate Nuthoobhai Kaloobhai. 36 Case of Ramabai. This case and No. 34 (as also that of Chimnia Wagh No. 38) throw light upon the insuperable objections raised by the Ranee Jumnabhai to remain in Baroda after the death of her late husband. Vide Government Resolution No. 5519 of 13th November 1871 and Government Resolution No. 6015 of 12th December 187l ; and correspon dence passim. In submitting this case to the notice of the Commission, the Resident desires clearly to point out that he has no inten tion of holding the Gaekwar responsible for an illegal surrend er of Baroda and foreign subjects by a British Magistrate. The illegal and improper action of a British official in sur rendering the accused persons cannot however exonerate the Gaekwar s Government from liability with regard to their previous or subsequent action in connection with this case. The points to which the attention of the Commission is respect fully directed are as follows: 1st.—The truth or falsity of the criminal proceeding submitted by the Durbar. 2nd.—The treatment of the chief offender, Tanee, as contrasted with the treatment of the other alleged offenders. 3rd.—The deli berate refusal of the Durbar to forward to the Resident any of the accused persons for examination after having succeeded in obtaining irregularly their surrender from British territories. 4th.—The circumstances under which Tanee's father, Succa- ram Nimbajee, was arrested and subsequently died in prison in Baroda, no mention of the surrender of this person having been made by the Railway Magistrate at Bhosawul. This girl's father came and petitioned the Resident on behalf of his daughter, who, he stated, had been imprisonei by order of the present Maharajah for about a year and a half without trial or judicial inquiry of any kind. Her alleged offence was, that she declared she knew nothing whatever re^ardin^ an alleged infamous intrigue between two persons of high position, and denied having attempted to administer a narco tic to the lady. She was for this thrown into prison, divorced from her husband,, and her father was fined Rs. 2,000—all without trial. She was a lowndee in the service of the present Ranee, and is not at present more than about 16 years of age. She was only released at the instance of the Resident, who represented the injustice of such cases to the Maharajah and advised her release. d The proceedings of the Durbar in the case of this Fukeer have been called for but have not as yet been produced. The man is an inhaoitant of Madras, and came in the course of his travels to Baroda, where he took up his quarters in a Dnurumshala. He was reported to the Resident as having been thrown into prison by the Maharajah for writing defamatory reports to the press. He was said to have been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and Rs. 1,000 fine, and in default ol payment to 5 years further imprisonment. He has been released in consequence of the Resident's enquiries. He has lost what little property he had. This woman s case is similar to that of the girl Tanee above squired to give false evidence to the efiect that one Govindjee Naik (who afterwards died suddenly in piison under suspicious circumstances and is generally be- leved to have been poisoned,) had been concerned in a liaison with the same lady referred to above. Upon refusal she was stripped of her property and thrown into prison without trial; Wxience she was released about a fortnight ago. after having been m prison for upwards of two years. ■pp*/&lt;£s 17 SCHEDULE No. Complaints of Baroda Subjects.

Measures were then adopted through the minister to obtain the attendance of the youth in question ; and the facts as related by Muggunbhai himself, are as follows ; it is submitted that they afford prima facie evidence of serious abuse of power and breach of trust on the part of His Highness Mulharrao, whose r lation to the minor in question is that of guardian. 'I am 17 years of age and reside at Baroda. Originally Hurree and Bhugtee were two brothers trading under the name of Hurree Bughtee at Poona under the Peishwa, and the firm accompanied Govindrao Gaekwar when he ascended the Gadi of Baroda, and he established them as the State Bankers/' I have heard part of an anonymous petition read to me. 1st, about 6 lacs of Rupees connected with my firm ; 2nd, a Nuzerana of five lacs taken on my adoption ; 3rd, the sum of 3 lacs of Rupees lent to Bhow Scindia; 4th, a receipt for Rs. 75,000 taken by His Highness Mulharrao, without paying the money; oth, Rs. 1,00^000 taken by Geerdhur Tricum himself; 6th, an emerald necklace and other orna ments with cash, chandeliers^ clock, Ac.,taken by the Maharajah Mulharrao ; 7th, the resumption about a year ago of our Inam village and allowances.' 'In the year 1925 His Highness Khunderao Maharajah appointed one Girdhur Tricum as Mooneem to superintend the affairs of my firm ; owing to the misconduct of this man, I made a petition to His Highness Khunderao to remove him; this was a few months before his death in 1870. Khunderao Maharajah died, and representations were continually made to the same effect to His Highness Mulharrao, but nothing was settled; then a cashier named Gordhun Bapoojee arranged through Balvuntrao Rahoolkur to give a Nuzerana of Rs. 75,000 to the Sirkar to get the appointment renewed; and a man named Choonilall Peetamber was appointed by me with the sanction of His Highness Mulharrao. This was about September 1871. Wussuntram Bhow and Bulvantrao Rahoolker threw difficulties in the way in their dealings with the firm as connected with the Government Banks, and Bul- vuntrao told me that unless I re-appointed Girdhur my firm would be ruined. Upon this I had no alternative but to reinstate Girdhur. Bulvuntrao Rahoolker was at that time doing the work of Dewan, and I looked upon this as an order of Government. Girdhur Tricum continued in my employ as Mooneem until about two months ago.' •''Next, about the six lacs ; it refers to a transaction which occur red when I was a minor ; but this much I know. That the Sirkar sent their men to examine our accounts, and they said that 20 lacs were owed by the firm to the State on account of some old debt, and a chit for 20 lacs of Rupees was taken from my adopted mother for that amount. Six lacs were paid by the firm in part payment of that amount, but three proofs were adduced by the firm to show that the debt had been really paid off, and in consequence of this His Highness Khunderao ordered that the said six lacs should be returned and no demand made for any more ; and Mulharrao Maharajah returned the chit for the 20 lacs; but did not retv/rw ^ lacs ordered by Khunderao, and they are still unpaid.

I paid not know whether the amount has been written off in 0llr books or not.' ' With regard to the second point I have been told that five lacs was paid as Nuzerana on the occasion of my adoption.' ' With regard to the third question of the loan to Bhow Scindia he had a Khata with the firm, but no large amount was due by him. Girdhur Tricum lent him about 2 or 2| lacs of Rupees on private account. This has not been repaid. We have filed a suit about this in the Court of the First Class Subordinate Judge of Naaik against the widows.' ' As regards the fourth question the Rs. 75,000 waslent privately to Mulharrao before he came to the throne. Some time after His Highness' accession the Mooneem Girdhur Tricum came to me and said that the Maharajah demanded of this sum without 'payment. I replied that it was unjust and that I would not do it. He then left for his house. He again came back to me at about 8 o'clock at night when I was in my bed-room, and he said that the receipt was demand ed, and that whether I would or not it was the pleasure of the Sirkar and must be signed; upon this I signed it.' Regarding the lac of Rupees alleged to have been taken by Girdhur Tricum himself, I beg to state that from time to ' time he did draw sums from the firm in his own name, and that the balance against him now is about Rs. 1_,17,000. J ' The sixth case which refers to the emerald necklace, other orna ments, cash, chandelier, clock, &amp;c., taken by His Highness the Maharajah, I beg to explain that about 7 or 8 months after His Highness accession to the throne, the Mooneem Girdhur Tri- cum came to me with a Jassood of His Highness, and said that • j 1 £ . mess required one or two ornaments to see. I per mitted him to take one or two, which were returned at once saj - ne &lt;%; that evening Balvuntrao Rahoolkur and Girdhur came to me and told me to show the jewels and ornaments in possession of the firm. 1 took them to the Jamdarkana and showed them the ornaments; Rahoolkur selected four or five and took them away, and took me also to the Maharajah.

A few days after this the Maharaja as usual came to my house in the Dewalee and took away a chandelier and a clock, both articles of high value. In making up the accounts with the Durbar for that Dewalee, the Durbar not only wanted credit for the | of a lac agreed upon to ensure the removal of Girdhur Tricum, but also for another Rs. 40,000 said to have been promised to the Maharajah by the Killedar (Cashier) under the following circumstances;—Goverdhun wanted to get the place of Manager of the new Government Bank, and he said that he would get Rs. 40,000 paid to the Maharajah from Hurree Bhugtee's firm if he got it. I protested against this, and asked why I should pay for the Cashier getting a place. Girdhur told me that theGoomasta had agreed to pay this amount and there fore that it would have to be paid. I know the above from what Girdhur told me, and Girdhur also said that on his tell ing the Maharajah that I objected to pay this amount he had Goverdhun confronted with him, but I told Girdhur that even if the Goomasta had promised, why should I pay for another man? He then said that the amount must be paid, and with much difficulty the amount was r thousand ; orders were accordingly given to the Durbar for this amount in the accounts of the firm. At the time when the quittance for Rs. 15,000 was given to the Sirkar, Girdhur said that Rupees ten thousand also had to be paid to the Sirkar and he took the ctfyiount. I don t know what has been paid during my minority or without my knowledge. After my adopted mother's death the Gaekwar Government took the manage ment of the firm into their hands by appointing Girdhur Tri- cum as Manager. Now I have employed Narayenrao Wamun Nafra as my Mooneem; the Maharaja has agreed to this arrangement.' About a year ago in September 1872 our four villages and al lowances were confiscated by the Gaekwar; some of the villages were given by the Peishwa and some by the Gaekwar/-' ' About the debts due by Bhow Scindia to the firm, I asked Girdhur to speak to the Maharajah about it, but he said that the Maharajah could do nothing, therefore we filed a suit in the Nasik Court. I also obtained a decree against Bhow Scindia in the Baroda Court for Rs. 2,30,000, but I have not recovered anything. I gave a chit for the commission on this suit. During Khunderao's lifetime Girdhur took some ornaments which he said had to be paid to Bhow Scindia. I do not know that they were so required.' A garden of ours at Baroda called Now Lukhee Bowree, and kept up at our expense, has been appropriated for the last two years by Mulharrao for the use of his concubine called Forth- warra, who is now residing there.'

Report of inquest by Gunesh Pandoorung Shastree and Doctors Aderjee Jamsetjee and Narraynrow Venayek. In June last year the Bombay Government in their Resolution No. 8940, after commenting upon the circumstances attending the death of Bhow Scindia in prison, so far as they were revealed by the Durbar, concluded with the following instruc tions ' His Excellency the Governor in Council is of opinion that in the present state of affairs at Baroda the Resident should not content himself with accepting all the official statements put forward by the Durbar, but should adopt independent means of ascertaining the true state of facts. Besides Bhow Scindia there have. His Excellency in Council believes, been other persons who were in favour with the late Gaekwar, who have been imprisoned by his succes sor and have died in confinement. The Resident should be directed to ascertain the number of these persons, the offences of which they were convicted, and the causes to which their deaths are ascribed.' &gt; The cases quoted in the margin,' beside? that under immediate .consideration, will amply illustrate the necessity for these instructions of Government. They show that under the present system of administration no reliance can as a rule be placed upon Durbar official statements in matters affecting the administration of public justice. On the death of the late Maharajah Khunderow at Mukkun- pura on November 28th, 1870, most of the followers and dependents of the late Maharajah were at once disgraced, and the most prominent of them thrown into prison. The following persons soon afterwards perished under circumstances which led to the popular belief that they had been poisoned:— 1. Bhow Scindia, ex-dewan of H. H. Khunderow. 2. Rowjee Master, a Karkoon employed in the service of Jamnabaee, Ranee of the late Maharajah Khunderow, who was apprehended in Bombay on a Durbar facie case. 3. Gunnoo Wagh, Khitmatgar and confidential servant in in H. H.'s household. 4. Mulharba Shilki, Khitmatgar and confidential servant of H. H. Khunderow. With regard to the first case, the belief is general in Baroda and has been so from the hour of Bhow Scindia's death on the 1st of May 1872, that he was poisoned in prison, and the ; evidence now placed on record for the first time appears to establish the fact conclusively. The following persons have j given evidence of the circumstances which attended the W • days and death of the ex-Minister, viz. :— 1, Moonshee Hubbeeboolah ; 2, Hurriba Gopalji; 8,Kooshaha| Govindrow ; 4, Eshwuntrow Succaram ; 5, Chimunrow Lux- num ; 6, Bulwuntrow Keshuv ; 7, Bulwuntrow SaguikWi 8, Narayenrow ; Ramchunder; 9, Kassinath Gunesh ; 10, Gun-j putrow Goojur ; 11, Amba.

Deposition of Jumal Peerbhai Turnkey. Deposition of Gunesh Gheer, Jail sweeper. Deposition of Daroo Siddoo, Jail Duffedar. Colonel Shortt, in reporting to Govern ment on this evidence in May last year, spoke of Krishnarow Bheema Shunkurj alias Tatia Shastree in the followin terms:— ' The first of these depositions is given by the grand son of Gunghadhur Shastree, who is confined in a room close to that occupied by the late Minister, not in the Jail, but in what is called the Jailor's house/' This was submitted in favour of the reliability of this principal witness 5 but when I state that this very Tatia Shastree was the confidant and companion of Mulharrow Gaekwar at the time of the conspiracy against the life of H. H. Khunderow in 1863 ; that it was he who sought to seduce Serjeant-Major Higgins of the 28th N. I from his allegiance for the purpose of murdering the reigning Gaekwar; that he was tried, convicted, and sen tenced to rigorous imprisonment for life for this crime by himself when Fouzdar of Baroda ; then I respectfully submit that there ^ is jprimd fads proof of the utter unrelia- bity of this man's evidence. Such evidence it is submitted ought never to have been imposed on the British Resident by the Gaekwar Government. Had the facts now stated been brought to the notice of Government, further steps would have been taken at the time to obtain the fuller and more reliable evidence which is now forthcoming. Tatia Shastree was released from jail by H. H. Mulharrow shortly after the events referred to, and he is now resid ing in a village en the Nurbudda or was so recently. G G E The property of the late Gunnoo Wagh is sworn at upwards of 3 lakhs and that of Mulharba Shelki at 1^ lakhs. Besides the above followers of Khunderow who have perished in confinement, the following have been released after suffer ing confinement for various periods, and after being deprived of all their property and losing their position in the Gaekwar's household, viz.:—(I), Moonshee Hubbeeboolah j (2), Chimnia 'Wagh; (3), Eshwuntrow Succaram Moongekur; (4), Kooshaba Chutriwala; (5), Bulwuntrow Keshur; (6), Masook Vakeel. Moonshee Hubbeeboolah states that he was possessed of per sonal property amounting to about Rs. 70,000 and two Inam • villages ; that he was thrown into prison without charge or trial O on the pretext that he had inflicted an unlawful fine of five Rupees on one of his own villagers. • Chimnia Wagh states that he has been deprived of ornaments and other property to the value of Rs. 51,000, and has been imprisoned up to the present time on an alleged charge, which he had not previously heard of, of attempting to burn down the Havelee. Eshwuntrow Succaram states that he has been deprived of pro perty amounting to about Rs. 89000, and has been imprisoned up to the present time without trial and on no charge whatever. Kooshaba Chutriwala states that he was possessed of consider able property amounting to upwards of Rs. 50,000, all of which he has been deprived of. He was released only a few days ago on the Resident's intercession after being imprisoned for up wards of two years. Bulwuntrow Keshow states that he was Huzur Kamdar under the late Maharajah Khunderow, and was possessed of property amounting to Rs. 61,000. He further states that he has been in prison 0 for upwards of three years without any trial or charge against him, and has been deprived of the whole of his property besides losing his employment in the Gaekwar s service. Masook Nursidass Vakeel, a British subject, was a favourite of His Highness Khunderow, under whom he was employed at one time in inquiring into the conduct of Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt, the present Sir Fouzdar, and NanajeeEshwunt, who were Wahiwatdars of the northern districts of Puttan, Kun, &amp;c., in 1868-69. He made up several cases against Bulwunt- row Eshwunt and Nanajee Eshwunt, and also showed that the Revenue Sirsooba, Hurreeba Dada, and his Deputy, Narayen- bhai, were concerned in the frauds brought by him to light. His Highness Khunderow imprisoned both Bui want Rao Esh- want and Nanajee Eshwant and intended treating Harriba Dada and Narrayan Bhai in a similar manner. In the mean time however the Maharajah died. Masook was then in Ahmedabadand came in three days to Baroda. Six days subsequently (December 1870) his wife was seized by Karkoon Baboorow of the Senaputee Department and Tatia Poonekur. He himself also was arrested, and imprisoned^for nine months and was only released on paying Rs. 15,000. His loss of property was considerable.22 SHEDULE No. II.— H Complaiuts of Baroda Subjects. j R emarks. Two other followers of H. H. Mul- harrow were condemned at the same time as Tatia Shastree to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment each. These were released and taken into H.H. Mulharow's private service again.

These three did not con fess. A lad said to have confessed. On the facts thus stated three questions for consideration arise-_ Upon what evidence and under what circumstances these persons were originally tried and convicted ? What legal disposition has been made of the propertv of all these persons, amounting to many lakhs of Rupees ? Under what circumstances the four persons first men tioned came to sudden death in prison at Baroda ? 1. 2. 3. The evidence now submitted will, in conjunction with that given in other cases, exhibit the main cause of the absolute terror and maladministration, which at present distract tho Baroda State. 6 In addition to the complaints of the principal followers specified above, similar complaints of loss of property, &amp;c., have been re ceived from 50 or 60 more of the late Gaekwar's adherents. It seems scarcely credible that such deliberate class persecution as has occurred in this instance, could have been committed with impunity in a State within 250 miles of Bombay surrounded by British territory, and having a British Resi dent ; yet such is the case ; and I would respectfully submit that having occurred at the capital of an ally of the British Government, the subject was deemed of sufficient importance to elicit the notice given to it by the Bombay Government m para. 4 of their Resolution No. 3940, of the 30th June lo7A, already quoted. The opening of railway communication between the Baroda district and Ahmedabad, Surat, Broach, and Bombay within the last few years is gradually but surely effecting great poli- tical changesm the Baroda State. Gaekwar subjects now visit the large cities freely as well as the British districts connect ing them; and hence they cannot fail to contrast their own position of semi-slavery with that of our subjects, and arrive , 0 CO f ^ S1 ? n i t ^ e hardships imposed on them are contrary to their own laws; which if administered with com- ancT happy SS impartla % render them contented T Tnt?fpow thi ® C ® se 1 f re Jriefly as follows The deceased ] i ' ^ Vll01 s alleged to-have been poisoned, was a con- GaeW ^ Wars that on March 1873, the Rung ceremony of the Holee 011 para : Je ^ round nea r the city, and that WATSI T^' 1 Tl T alleo-ed tW m 10l + ^ ^ the ceremony, and it is alleged that on his return to the palace in the evening he MstSr' ^ to ,. r ™°« red steins from TO soon aftcrwardrsISd witb 1 TO„tS d ' 'j tt^SnSr in tr ' ^ ® St tne wetting to which he had been subiected durins- the day. isr^om' w, SiSter ? ,f U&lt;1 tha ' he ^ poisonei -^ignt persons were arrested on suspicion of bomo- con- cerned m the murder, all of whom were publicly flogged in£ 23 SCHEDULE No. II,— E emabks. the streets of the city by order of the Gaekwar ; of the persons so flogged one, Gunnoo, died on the spot, and the other per sons were reported to be in a precarious state. The relations of the sufferers affirm that Tattia Powar died from natural cases, and that no crime was ever committed at all. The Durbar admit that four of the accused persons were con victed on their own confessions and that three did not confess. Tne case having been ordered to be laid before the Commission by Government, the proceedings were called for, but have not uggii furnished. Ill© petitioii6rs allege that confessions were extorted by the flogging in question. Upon these facts three questions for consideration arise:—- 1st.—Whether the deceased Tattia Powar was in fact poisoned as alleged ? 2nd. TV hether the flogging inflicted was a judicial sen tence inflicted after a legal investigation, or whether the flogging in question was the cause of, and preceded the confession of, four or five out of the 8 accused persons ? 3rd. If the sentence of flogging and imprisonment for life was the result of fair judicial inquiry and properly recorded proceedings according to the laws of the State why should the Durbar have delayed from April to October to reply to the Resident's letter putting the following questions of Government:— 1st. Under what judicial procedure the prisoners received their sentences ? Snd. By what steps the Durbar ascertained that the Gaekwar's servant had really died from the effects of arsenic ? Srd. In what way the confessions were obtained, cvnd what was the exact nature of the admission made by the accused ? In the Durbar reply No. 2145, dated 9th October 1873, these questions are not satisfactorily answered, no sufficient in formation having been afforded as to the judicial procedure under which sentences were passed, the confessions obtained, and the steps taken to ascertain that the deceased had really died from the effects of poison. The Government therefore m their letter No. 6919, of 16th November, have ordered that the judicial proceedings of the Gaekwar authorities in this case may be brought before the Commission. The iudiciai proceedings were accordingly called for in Yad No. of November 13th, 1873. Another reminder was sent in Yad No. 2810 ofNovember 20th, requesting that all the persona concerned might be sent to the Resident, together with the proceedings, naming a specific date, namely, November 21st. Up to the present time no answer has been received, and neither the proceedings nor the persons concerned are forth coming.^ In the mean time His Highness the Gaekwar under the Resident's advice liberated four of the prisoners ; two only, viz., Dajeeba Kamatee and Vittoba, who are said to'have con fessed their crime, being kept in prison.24 SCHEDULE No. II .— continue 40 Complaints of Baroda Subjects.

The number said to have been deprived of their liberty i B this manner amounts to between 400 or 500 women and gir^ most of whom are only 22 years of age and under, &amp;C., The following specific instances were brought to His Highness' notice :— A Soni named Keshowlal Jeta complained that his wifeSuraj, aged about 22 years, had been first seduced and then made a Lowndee under the following circumstances:— The complainant stated that two persons living close to his house in the city, viz., Runchord and Gopi, sons of the noto rious Bhugwundass Ragonathdass (who was in prison for 5 years in 1863, for aiding and abetting conspiracy, and dieii in prison) are neighbours of the complainant, whose wife Suraj was seduced and carried off by Runchord, in April last, together with ornaments, clothes, &amp;c.; sometime elapsed before the complainant could obtain any clue to the hiding place of his wife, but he at last discovered that she was living in a garden lately given by your Highness to Runchord and Gopi on the road to Mukunpura. The complainant obtained the assistance of a police peon and went to arrest the girl, but Runchord's servants declared that they would not allow her to be arrested without orders from their master. Runchord was sent for, and when he came threatened complainant who was obliged to withdraw ; complainant then went to complain to the Fouzdar and Senaputty, and finally to your Highness, who on that occassion was accompanied by the Ministei and Hariba Dada and others. Complainant represented his circumstances and your Highness asked Suraj where she W gone to after leaving her husband. She replied that she had gone to Bombay because her husband beat her, and did no give her food and clothing; and that for this reason she ha j gone to live with Runchord, and that she wished to stay 1V1 _ him. Complainant was then sent back to the Senaputty 9 , Cutcherry, and was eventually told that his wife could not I restored to him or any of his property; that she had heensei to the Nava Wada as a Lowndee, and that she was in cm ' m of a private servant of His Highness, Wussuntram The complainant states that he accordingly went to ^ SS aJ ram Bhow and demanded his wife, but was told in reply 1 she was made a Lowndee and that he could not have her. | then demanded her ornaments, but was told that a 1 Lowndee must have her ornaments.

B emabks, Tims it appears that the wife of this goldsmith was sent with the Maharajah's knowledge to serve as a Lowndee, notwithstand- | ing her husband's repeated applications for her restoration to him. The case was eventually settled by the woman being restored to her husband, and the value of he r ornaments, amounting to about Rs. 600^ which had been taken from her being also restored. [The case of Malsahbai was briefly that her daughter,, aged 17, had been forcibly carried away by Government sepoys and made a ! Lowndee in His Highness the Gaekwar's household. This girl was also released on the application of the Resident. The case of Kondajee is precisely similar; viz., th at Government sepoys had seized his wife and made her a Lowndee. He stated that the primary object of these sepoys in seizing her was to prostitute her. This girl also was released on the application of the Resident. The truth of case No. 4 is denied by the Durbar, notwithstanding the fact that her release was obtained by the Resident through the Minister. The principal offender in this case was His i Highness' Private Secretary, Damodur Punt. A good deal of correspondence has taken place about it, and the present result appears to be that the girl's friends are afraid to come forward for fear of her being excluded from caste, if the facts of the case are publicly recorded in Court. In addition to the abovementioned cases, some 8 or 10 women similarly abducted and made to serve as Lowndees were released i on the Resident's intercession ; no record of these cases was kept except in the instance of a woman named Gunga, who wa^ seized and made to render forced service to a mistress of Hi^ Highness by name Luximeebai. On the 20th September last a case of a Koli girl having been sold to Bulwunt- row Nagurkur, in His Highnesss private employ, was brought to the notice of the Durbar. In this case a reply was received to the effect that the girl has no other protector and wished to stay with Bul- wuntrow, her parents not being known. The subject of abduction was again brought to the notice of Government in letter of October 4th 1873, forwarding for information the petition of one Kashee, woman, with accom panying correspondence. This woman's daughter was for cibly abducted to serve as a Lowndee in the Ranee's house hold. Her deposition was taken, in which she states that she was taken direct to the Maharajah. That she wept bitterly and asked to be released, but that he was in exorable and ordered her to be kept in the Ranee's house hold. She was released on the interposition of the Resident. This was a distinct case of forcible abduction in which the Maharajah himself gave direct orders, The petition of a relative of the Gaekwar, Jugoba Jugtap, for warded to Government with letter No. of 24th September, shows how the Maharajah endeavoured to possess himself of a kept mistress of the former. This was resisted by the Sirdar and another girl was given in her place to His High ness ; but the whole transaction proves the existence of the system, and shows that if His Highness will send men forcibly to abduct a girl from the house of a relative, others of less rank in Baroda have probably suffered in a similar manner^16 v 1 SCHEDULE No. IT.— Complaints of Baroda Subjects.

The only other case deserving of special notice is that of two girls from Kattywar who were in the service of the late Gaek- war's Ranee, Jumnabaee, and accompanied her to Poona, It appears that two of the Durbar men employed on this work, Tattia Poonekur and Bunderow, who went to Poona to escort the Eanee to her residence there, brought back the Junaghur girls and three or four others as Lowndees. A refer- ence was made to the Durbar about the two Kattywar girls, on behalf of their father in Residency Yad No. 1835 of September 7th^ 1871 ; to this reference no reply was received till January 1873, when the Durbar declared that the girls had gone with the late Ranee to Poona, whereas they were at that moment in Baroda. The Durbar were again applied to in consequence of a demand made for the girls by Mr. Peile, Political Agent, Kattywar. The Durbar positively and persistently denied that the girls were in Baroda, and sent up Tattia Poonekur and Bunderao to the Resident, accompanied by the Dewan and Bulwuntrow Yeswunt and Bapoobhai for the purpose of giving him information on the subject. The Resident dis tinctly asked each person what had become of the girls, and they openly declared that they were not in Baroda but had gone to Poona with Jumnabaee. The Resident believed the men, supported as they were by the Durbar, and was about to write to Poona to have the girls sent at once to Baroda; but as soon as the Durbar had left the Residency, a Karkoon of the office who had gone to Poona with Jumnabaee declared positively that the girls were at that moment in His High ness' own household in the City. I accordingly informed His Highness to that effect, when he said that if I could point out the girls they would be given up. My Karkoon and others went to the City and returned with the two girls who have been made over to Mr. Peile for restoration to their father:— Thus in the first instance a lawful demand made by the Re sident is evaded for nearly tw T o years; then a distinct denial is given that the girls are in Baroda ; thirdly, this false statement is supported by apparently false depositions, reiterated orally in presence of the Durbar to the Resident himself. This case has been referred to the Durbar, but no reply has yet been received. The facts will be seen from the following state ment. Statement on solemn affirmation of Beynee, wife of Tooljaram Motiram, a Yisnagar Brahmin, age about 25 years, resident of Visnagar, His Highness the Gaekwar's territory :— ' I live in the town of Yisnagar, where there is a Wahiwutdar named Bulwuntrow Trimbuck, About 8 or 10 days before the Dewalee (10th instant), a young brother of mine, named Bhoolia ^ Hurreeshunkur, aged about 12 years, came to seei^ from Bijapur, where my father resides. He came in the evening and slept in my house. Next evening he went out, and as he had not returned by ten o'clock, the folio wing morning I went to my sister s house named Jurree., wife ol27 SCHEDULE No. II. — continue E emaeks. Muggon Kaysorain, to inquire if he had gone there. I did not find him there_, and returned home. An hour or two after, two or three peons came to my house and sat in the entrance. I asked them why they had come ; they said that my brother had been accused of theft, and that they had come to attach the house. My husband was absent at the time, so I opened the inner apartment and stood outside, wdiilst a Govern ment Karkoon and several others came and searched the house. Nothing was found. The attachment was removed, and I re-occupied the house. In the evening the Wahiwutdar sent for me to the Cutcherry. I went there; and he asked me whether my brother had given me any stolen ornaments ? I replied no. He than asked me whether my brother had come to my house ? I said he had come and remained one day, but that I had not seen him since. This was about 7 or 8 P.M. The Wahiwutdar called upon me to furnish security, which I did to the extent of Es. 500. I was then allowed to go home ; for three days I heard nothing more of the matter. On the evening of the fourth day sepoys Kuljee Meana and Meer Khan came to my house and said that the Wahiwutdar re quired my presence. This was about 7 or 8 p.m. 1 went to the Cutcherry. I saw my brother Bhoolia and his companion Chotia being beaten on that occasion. The Wahiwutdar told me to hear what my brother said. I replied that I did not know anything about the matter, and that a thief would say anything to save himself. The Wahiwutdar said that my brother had given the names of the following persons as con cerned in a theft: viz., Lulloo Brahmin Oozum^ a female of the Kussara caste ; my sister Jurree; Chotia Uttaypooro_, a boy ; Lei a/ a Brahmin. The Wahiwutdar said that nothing was found in the houses of those persons when searched, but that ^ my brother had mentioned my name as concerned in having received the property, and that I must confess. I denied knowing any thing at all about the matter, upon which I was imprisoned in the jail and my house was attached. On the 'ind day my daughter, 7 or 8 years old, brought food to me; but I did not partake of it as I was in grief. I was summoned to the Cutcherry about noon. Several people were present there, and I was again called upon by the Wahiwutdar to confess. I again said that I knew nothing whatever about the matter and that I had nothing to confess. The Wahiwutdar said that my brother had accused me, and that if I did not confess I should be beaten and the skin taken off me. I cried and told the Wa- hiwutdar again in an entreating manner that I knew nothing about the matter. He then called the sepoy Kuljee, saying that he alone could bring me to my senses. He came and commenced pushing me about and beating me with his fists. I was not allowed to sit down and no one would give me water, nor was I allowed to go out to make water. This went on till the evening when 1 was remanded to jail. On ihe^rdday at noon I was again sent for, and the Wahiwutdar again called upon me to confess. There were many people present. I gave the same reply as before that I knew nothing about the mat ter. The Wahiwutdar then said that without severe beating I should not come to my senses. Then by order of the Wahi wutdar they brought a purda, which they fastened by ropes to one end of the Cutcherry, so as to form a private room. The Wahiwutdar used the most indecent language to me, and ordered that chilies might be brought for the purpose of taking my reputation. Eed chilies were bruised and placed in two small bags. I was then taken inside the purda by Kuljee and another man whose name I do not know, but whom I might28 SCHEDULE No. II—continued. Remarks, recognise if I saw him. The Desais and other respectable persons who were in the Cutcherry on this withdrew and went out on the terrace. The Wahiwutdar and some Karkoons remained in the Cutcherry. Umrattal Desai did not go to the terrace but remained with the Whahiwutdar. Wh en inside the purda Kuljee commenced pulling me about violently, and said that the bags would be applied to my private parts if I did not confess. I cried out loudly. This lasted for some time, when the Whahiwutdartold KuljeethatI would not come to terms here^ and that I should be taken down to the stable and that a peg should be brought and my reputation taken. This was accompanied by the most indecent language. I was then taken to the stable. It was evening: Kuljee and the other man then tied a rope to a post and fastened my hands up over my head. No one was allowed to be near the stable. They then strip, ped me naked except my choolee and petticoat. The latter was then lifted up and one of the bags of chilies were applied to my private parts by Kuljee. The other man had a peg in his hand and made indecent gesture with it saying that he would use it; he did not do so. Kuljee called upon me to confess but I did not do so^ but cried out from the excesive pain and also from terror. Some one called out from outside that the Wahiwutdar ordered me to be released and sent back to jail which was done. I wept nearly the whole of that night in the jail from pain and shame. The guard and the other prisoners consoled me, and they said that if my cries were heard by the Whahiwutdar further violence would be used, but that God would help me.' Ath day.—^exi day I was again sent for to the Outcherry at noon and the Wahiwutdar informed me that I could not escape, and that if I did not confess my skin would be stripped off. I again repeated that I knew nothing about the matter. The Wahiwutdar then said ''if you have given the ornamentsto Lela or any one else you must confess it.' I said that I had not given anything to any one, and how could I confess. The Whahiwutdar then gave orders that a tobra of chilies might be applied to my face. Previous to this I was flogged with a rope by Kuljee ; several people were present, but I cannot say who, because I had covered my face, some people of my caste being present. Powdered chilies were then put into a cloth and bound round my month and nose except the eyes. This was kept on for about ten minutes when I beckoned with my hands in token of agony. I could not cry out in con sequence of the cloth over my mouth. The pain was very great. I wanted water but they would not give me any, nor would they allow me to go out to relieve nature. About evening the Wahiwutdar ordered that I should be removed to the jail, and added that if 1 still held out it would cost me my life ; that I need not expect to be released and go and live with my hus band. I then went to jail; but the pain of my nose aud mouth was very great. Nothing was done to alleviate the pain. I washed my face and applied some oiL ,? &lt;( 5th day. —-Next day I was sent for by the Wahiwutdar into a private room of his own where he performs his worship* attached to the Cutcherry. I was called upon again to confess, Kuljee was present, and that the same treatment as before would be resorted to. There were present at the time o 110 Nana, a Buneya employed by the Wahiwutdar as a writer Mu^ 1 lal son of Hurgovind Desai; a Brahmin named Gayla, of j 1S nagar, residing in Mywarra; a Choledar, and others!!

The Wahiwutdar took a small stick and beat me with it on my arms and broke one of my bangles and poked the butt end of it into my breasts. I did not confess and was ordered to be taken away. Kuljee and Nana Buneya went with me to the jail. While we were going down the steps Nana said that as I did not still confess my skin would be stripped off, and he used insolent language to me; he also said that if I bribed him he would get me released. I replied that if violence was still con tinued I should be forced to commit suicide. Nana laid hold of my neck and squeezed it, when I requested to be killed outright and not by torture, that I could not stand this any longer. Nana then said let a brick be brought and my teeth knocked out. This was not done. I was then taken to jail.' Qth day. —Next day I was called to the Cutcherry and again call ed uponto confess, and that I should be released, if I mention ed the names of any persons. Under the promise of release and the terror of further torture, I was induced to make a false con fession to the effect that I had given some stolen oranments to Lela and the brother of Chotea XJttaypurra, the boy said to be the companion of my brother Bhoolea. All this was false. I did not mention any other particulars, but I said yes to what ever the Wahiwutdar asked. The statement was not read over to me. I was then sent back to the Jail. I was then released on bail on the Dewalee day. After this I came here.' 1. Jumnabaee, Ranee of the late Khunderao Gaekwar. As regards the 'Ranee's claim to Stridhan, the Government decided that the Gaekwar should pay a lakh^ and the Go vernment of India even sanctioned the lakh being deducted from the tribute, but by letter No. 8567 of 1873_, the Resident was told verbally to recommend the Gaekwar to pay^ so as to avoid the Government being obliged to deduct it from the tribute on His Highness' account. ' The Resident may now be told that this unsettled matter should not be lost sight of at the present juncture, and that it should be included in the arrangements which may be made in pursuance of the inquiries of the Commission.' Bombay Government Resolution No. 6902 of November 11th 1873. It will be seen by referring to the correspondence in this case that the Baroda Durbar decline to admit the right of the Ranee Jumnabaee toany Stridhan whatever,YadNo. 1878 of July 7th 1872^ forwarded to Government, with Resident's letter No. ot August 14th^ 1872. The Bombay Govern ment in their reply No. of September 21st, remark that they find it impossible to accept the representations of the Durbar on this subject for reasons stated, and earnestly re commended the Maharajah to reconsider his decision. With Colonel Shortt's letter No. of December 5th was forwarded a Yad from the Durbar No. 2680 of November 28th 1872, reiterating the former decision and stating that they 8 G R f 1 s sso SCHEDULE No, II— v Complaints of Baroda Subjects. B emarks. declined to admit any elaim for Stridhan on the part of the Ranee Jnmnabaee. No further communication has been made to the Durbar in writing since the Yad of November 28th has been received. It is clear that nothing further remains but to carry out autho ritatively the decision of Government^ as expressed in Govern ment Resolution No. 6902 of November 11th, 1873. 2.

Chimnajee Raje Madik, maternal uncle of Umbabai, wife of the late Khunderao, complains that in consequence of his relationship and connection with the late Khunderao, he has been deprived by the present Maharajah of his allowance of Rs, 250 per mensem.

In addition to the cases abovementioned^, petitions have been received from other members of the Graekwar's family, com plaining of reduction and deprivation of allowances on various pretexts,. The following statement was made by Gunputrao Gopalrao before the Resident on the 24th November 1873 :— T am son of Gopalrao Gaekwar, a descendant of Pillajee Gaek- war's uncle. My father died 3 years ago. He used to get an allowance of 300 Rupees a month ; his understanding was deranged. For two years subsequent to his death I drew the same allowance. For the year Sumvut 1929 I have not as yet received any allowance. H. H. Mulharrao gave orders that it should be reduced toRs. 200 per month ; and therefore I objected to receive the reduced allowance. Since the arrival of the Commission, H. H. has given orders that the original allowance of Rs. 300 per mensem should be disbursed. This allowance of Rs. 300 is not sufficient for the maintenance of our family which is a large one. My house is in a ruinous state and we are obliged to live in the stables; I pray that H. H. may be moved to have the house repaired. I am not invited to Durbars ; for the last 8 or 10 months I have been under surveillance of the police, but recently by the advice of the Resident the police have been removed. I was not even allowed to leave my house to go any where. The police were not ordered to keep me under surveillance in con sequence of any offence of mine. In February last I, my brother Khunderao, my mother, &amp;c., left Baroda to go to Nerbudda to perform a pilgrimage. At the first stage we received a message from my maternal uncle, Ramrao Bhug- want, that H. H. Mullarao's men came to my house to inquire where I had gone; and Ramrao suggested that we should immediately return as otherwise we should be arrested by H. H. on some false charge. The next morning I return ed to Baroda and went up to H. H. and asked him why he had sent men to my house; he replied that I had left Baroda without leave. I pointed out that it was not necessary for me to do so as such had not been the custom. From that date my house was under surveillance, and I have not had liberty to leave the precincts of my house, even for the pur pose of taking the necessary exercise. Moreover, though holding the rank of a Sirdar, I have not been allowed to take part in any of the State festivals or Durbars, and am treated with contempt as if I had committed some crime. My prayer therefore is that a suitable allowance according to my rank and position in the State may be accorded to me ; and that I piay enjoy the freedom which is my right/'32 SCHEDULE No. Complaints of BarodaSubjects. 44 Kemarks^ 'My brother Khunderao and I have the following persons depej, dent upon us : our mother and 2 step mothers, our two wives J children, a step-sister, 3children of a step-brother who'ij deceased, a maternal aunt, 2 maternal uncles, one wife, and four children, 10 domestic dependents.

My brother is about 21 years of age. We are in debt to the extent of about fifteen thou, sand Rupees contracted during my father's time and since, to defray funeral expenses and my brother's marriage. My father used to visit at the Residency, and the Resident used to arrange his affairs, but we have been prohibited from com ing, and pray that this prohibition may be removed.' Before me, (Signed) R. PHAYRE, Resident. 24th November 187S. The facts of this case are briefly as follows r— Case of Kassiram Ambaram, of Sidhpurln the year 1869-70 the petitioner, Kassiram Amharam, put- under Put tun. chased from some Pahlunpur merchants a quantity of coins which a Kolee Thakurda named Anda Sundraof M( in the Puttun District had found in his field. This fact having reached the ears of the Durbar officials in Puttun, the the petitioner, Kassiram Ambaram, was seized, his house was placed under attachment, and his own property, consisting ofj gold and siever ornaments to the value of Rs. 1,200 and cast to the value of Rs. 648, was taken away. Anda Sundra and his wife were also seized^ and both of them were severely flog ged to extort confession from them regarding the disposal of the coins. Petitioner states that both Anda Sundra and his wife were confined and that they both died in confinement. Their deaths he attributes to the ill-treatment which they received in prison. The petitioner himself states that he was in con finement for nearly a year and was then released on bail. After being released the petitioner was requested to pay a. sum of Rs. 1,835 on account of the coins purchased by him from Pahlunpur merchants, although he had paid this sum hond fide for the coins in question, and although his own pro perty as above stated had been attached and made away with by the Durbar officials. The facts of this case were brought to the notice of the Durbar by Resident's Yad No. 1880 of August 14th, 1873, forwarding the petition of Kashiram Ambaram. The reply of the Durbar, No. 1882 of September 8th ; is as follows :— l/Vith regard to this case the petitioner having complainsd ^ us, the case was sent for from the Wahiwatdar and was j inquired into. In the meantime, owing to the absence oft 6 petitioner, the matter remained undisposed of.

This is written for your information This answer being considered unsatisfactory, as affording no explanation whatever of the serious allegations made by the petitioner, a further Yad was addressed to the Durbar, No, 2239, of September 22nd, 1873, pointing out that if the case had been finally disposed of, a gross failure of justice had taken place, and urging that the Fouzdar of Puttun, named Nalchund, should be brought to trial for the alleged ill-treat ment and violence inflicted on the persons of Anda Sundra and his wife, which is stated to have been the cause of their death, and also for his treatment of the petitioner; and stating that ttie Wahiwatdar of Puttun, named Narayen Rugunath, should be also placed on his trial by the Durbar for his alleged share in the transaction related by Kassiram Ambaram.

I have received from Maharajah Khunderao many favours, and was possessed of personal property amounting to about Rs. 87,000^ as shown in the Yad which I produce, marked A. The details of the amount are shown in a second statement which I produce, marked B. Besides this personal property, I was possessed of one inamee village named Ranolee^ valued Rs. 4,000 per annum, given to me by His Highness Khunderao, besides another village named Lnmadra, which I and my brother had bought from a certain Bhat named Jeelhai The name of this village I changed to Kadurpura. The income of this village was about Rs. 2^200 annually. The sunnud given me by Khunderao for the village of Ranoli has been taken from me by the Fouzdar, Bulwantrao Yeshwunt. 1 produce the original deed of sale for the village of Lumdra or Kadurpura. In addition to the above property^ I was possessed of several houses of the total value of about Rs. 65,500. The whole of this property I have been deprived of. I can assign no valid reason for this wholesale deprivation. On the day that His Highness Khunderao died, the whole of my per sonal property was attached, and guards were placed over them, I was not allowed to go out of my house. I was forbidden by His Highness Mulharrao himself to leave my house. I remained in confinement in my house for 9 months ; during this time no charge whatever was brought against me, but I was brought on one occasion to the Fouzdaree to give evidence in the case of Raojee Master. After I had been in confinement for 9 months as above stated, I was summoned to the Fouzdaree, and was there charged for having levied an illegal fine in my village of Ranoli. The Fouzdar asked me whether I had levied a fine of Rs. 10 in stead of a fine of Rs. 5 according to the provisions of the law* I said that when the fine in question was levied I was in Mecca, but that a fine of 10 rupees appeared to have been levied. I was then told by Bulwuntrao Yeshwunt that I34 SCHEDULE No. II ,— continu Complaiats of Baroda Subjects. Eemarks.

My clothes were stripped off, ropes were attached to my arms, and I was carried through the streets as a common malefactor. I was not informed by Bulwuntrao Yeshwant what my sentence was, but was informed by Bho. jungrow, the Deputy Jailor, that my sentence was sixIXlontlls , imprisonment, and he showed me the warrant for the same When the period of my sentence had expired, I used to J constantly to the Deputy Jailor and ask him why I was set at liberty. Bhojungrow informed me that I was not to be set at liberty. I was released, from Jail finally about 13 days after Bhow Scindia had died in prison. I was taken to the Kesidency to Colonel Shortt* who asked me whether my name was Moonshee Hubeebulla, and what my sentence was ? I replied that my name was Moonshee Hubeebulla. Bulwunt- rao Teshwunt replied that my sentence was. 6 months' impri. sonment. Before I was taken to the Resident,. I was made to sign a paper that I would not complain^ and that I wouli go to the Lady, Jumnabaee, wife of His Highness Khunderao. After I left the Resident I was kept under surveillance for 25 days, and then I went to Ahmedabad, where I have been up to the present time. During all the period of my imprisonment my family were in confinement, and my wife died of grief at the treatment to which I was subjected. I have been deprived of everything that I had in the world, and am now left destitute. The alleged crime of which I was convicted was committed in my absence. If any crime at all is committed it is of the most trifling nature, but I do not admit that even any crime was committed at all by my servants. During my stay in prison at Baroda I have seen women severely flogged. I have in terceded for them. It is a practice to flog women with a cane on their bare backs. I can name women who have been flogged if requisite. The facts of this case appear from the following statement of the petitioner:— I was a Khidmutgar in the service of His Highness Khunde rao. My family have been employed in the Gaekwar's household. Since the time of Damajee Gaek war His High ness Khunderao was most kind to me and showed me many favours. I received from the Maharajah ornaments and other property amounting to about Rs. 51^000, the details of which are shown in the Yad accompanying my petition. Fifteen days after the death of Khunderao, I was arrested by the present Maharajah's orders. No charge was brought against me that I am aware of; but I was questioned regarding the Ranee Jumnabhaee, and regarding Bhow Khedker, whom I arrested. I was not questioned on any other subject. After this I was kept in imprisonment for about 3 months^ when I was despatched to Gumdi Bajpur. I was kept at Gum- di Bajpur for about 2 months^ and then was kept at Song- hud. The climate of Gumdi Bajpur and Songhud is ex tremely bad : sentence of imprisonment there is practically a sentence of death. Few prisoners can survive the cliniate ^ long.* I was afterwards brought back to Baroda Jail. There j I have remained up to the month of November 1873^ when I was released on the occasion of tlie eclipse of tlis ihood along with 74 other persons. When I returned home a fe* days ago, I was informed for the first time that I had been charged with an attempt to burn down the Haveli. TheN 35 SCHEDULE No. II,— Complaints of Baroda Subjects. R emarks, This agrees with the statement ofChimajee Waoh himself. falsity of this charge is shown by the fact that I was im prisoned about a month and a half before the alleged burn ing in the Haveli took place. I am utterly ruined; all my property has been taken away; I have been thrown into prison for nearly three years without any charge and without any trial whatever; and pray that I may receive compensation and justice for the loss and injury sustained. During my stay in prison at Baroda, I have seen women severely flogged there. It is a practice to flog them with a cane on their bare backs. With reference to the case of this petitioner, the following re marks were addressed to the Durbar in Yad No. 2374, of October 6th, 1873 ;— 'W ith regard to Chimunrow Wagh, I have already had some correspondence and conversation with your Highness, and from what has come to my knowledge, I am in duty bound to bring to your notice again the case of this man, and to re quest that I may be informed of the actual facts of his case as ordered by Government (referring to para. 4 of Govern ment Resolution No. 3940, of June 30th, 1872.) In the first place, he petitioned Government on the 3rd of Juiy 38/1, upon which a reference was made by Government to the Resident regarding him. Colonel Barr, in his reply No. 138—785 of July 1871, reported to Government that, from in formation supplied by the Durbar, Chimajee Wagh had been tried and sentenced of a charge of having been concerned in maliciously setting fire to a store-room attached to the Palace, which was burnt down suddenly, and which might have produced a very extensive conflagration. Colonel Barr does not mention to what period of imprisonment Chimaj ee Wagh was sentenced, and your Highness will observe that this was in the month of July 1871. In the following month of August further inquiry appears to have been made by the Resident as to the number of persons convicted of this crime of setting fire to the said store-room, and in reply to these inquiries I have on record in my office, an original note of the Sir Fouzdar, Bui want Yeshwunt, in which he causes a list oi the persons implicated in the alleged burmno' of the store-room in question to be given to the Resident for his information ; and in that list the name ofChimajee Wao-h does not appear. I attach a copy of the Sir Fouzdar's note and the accompanying list marked I and II. Thus the evidence is clear on the best authority possible viz.. that of the Sir Fouzdar, that the said Chimajee Wagh was not concerned in the burning of the store-room alluded to. Indeed, I have been informed that the small store-room in question was not burnt down, but that some rubbish only caught fire accidentally, which was extinguished before any mischief was done. Mulharba Shalkee was the man really m charge of the place, and any damage done to the room was from pulling part of it down and not from fire. * ss36 SCHEDULE No. II .— continu J Complaints of Baroda Subjects. 47 Case of Goolam Kadur Kureem Oollah. The next information on record in this office is nearly a year afterwards, when, in consequence of the number of Khunde- rao's favourite followers who had been thrown into prison under variou s pretexts, four of whom had died suddenly, the Resident received the orders of Government contained in para, 4 of Government Resolution No. 3940, of June 30th, 1872, and again referred to the Durbar for information as to the number of Khunderao's followers who had been imprisoned and were at that time living. Amongst those named was Chimia Wagh. This man Colonel Shortt reports in his No. 130—759 of 16th of August 1872 for the first time, had been charged with bribery and an infamous intrigue. When I asked your Highness the other day about Chimia Wagh, you did not mention the case of bribery at all, but stated that he had been sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment for the other two crimes. In the face, therefore, of all this conflicting evidence, I have arriv ed at the conclusion that either the Sir Fouzdar has sent in a false report to Government^ or that the original offence with which Chimia Wagh was charged was simple bribery. The man has now been in confinement for nearly two years and a half, and I would strongly recommend either that the man be discharged at once and allowed to proceed to his native country (Deccan), or that the proceedings on all the charges brought against him be produced for the satisfaction of Go vernment. The following is the statement of the petitioners case as made by himself:— 48 I am the elder brother of Hubbeebulla Moonshee. I was in the service of the late Maharajah Khunderao for 25 years. When Khunderao died I was Soobha of Nowsari on a salary of Rs. 200 per mensem. I received many favours from the late Maharajah, and hold separate sunnuds from him for palkee, paga, and inam village. The name of my village is Khan- pur, valued at about Rs. 2_,400 annually. I was also possess ed of personal property to the value of Rs. 72,000 and houses to the value of Rs. 15,500. I also hold a half share with my brother Moonshee Hubbeebulla, in the village of Lumadra or Kadurpura. The present Maharajah has stripped me of everything that I had in the world. I have been charged with no offence, nor have I been brought to trial. I was kept under surveillance in my house for 17 months, and was not allowed to leave it; when my brother went to Ahmed abad, I accompanied him, and have been there up to the present time. My village of Khanpur has been given to one of the Maharajah's followers named Mookoondrao Mama, who was im prisoned in 1863 for conspiring with Tatia Shastree and others against the life of Khunderao Maharajah.

Four days after Khun- deroa died I was imprisoned and all my property attached. I was told that there was some paper in my house of a suspicious character. I told my informant to search my house, and my house was searched accordingly. No paper was found. I was kept for 6 months a prisoner in my house and was then taken off to prison. 8 or 9 of Khunderao's followers were in prison with me about the same time. While I was in prison I was fettered with fetters weighing half a maund. I re mained in prison about 2^ years, and have just been released at the recent eclipse of the moon. Up to the present time, I have never been tried nor have any questions been asked me^ except with regard to the paper which was suspected to be in my house. I have been deprived of all my property and am now a ruined man. I pray for justice. During my stay in prison at Baroda, I have seen women severely flogged there. It is a practice to flog them with a cane on their bare backs. This petitioner states that he came from Deccan to Baroda when very young, and that be has been in the service of the Gaek- war since the time of Syajeerao; and that at the time of Khunderao's death he occupied the post of Jemadar of (Jhat- reewallas in the Maharajah's houshold. Petitioner further states that he was possessed of personal property amounting to about Rs. 72,000, besides houses to the value of Rs. 8^500 and other property, of all of which he has been deprived; he states that he was arrested in connection with the charge of setting fire to the Havelee, and was cast into prison on declining to make a full confession and implicate innocent persons as he was instigated to do; that no investigation was made, and no witness were examined in his presence; that he suffered great hardships in jail, being kept for the first 6 months in solitary confinement; that he was only recently been released at the Resident's intercession. Petitioner prays that compensation may be awarded to him for the loss and injuries which he has sustained. The facts of the petitioner's case appear from the following statement of the petitioner made before the Resident:— I am a British subject and a native of Ahmedabad, but I have loner been employed at Baroda where I practise as a Vakeel* I enjoyed the favour of His Highness Khunderao, by whom I was employed to investigate certain charges against Bui- wuntrao Yeshwunt, Fouzdar, Nanajee Yeshwunt, Hariba Dada, and Narayenbhai Laloobhai. His Highness Khunderao im prisoned Bulvuntrao Yeshwunt and Nanajee Yeshwunt^ and would have imprisoned Hariba Dada and Narayenbhai had not his death occurred. After Khanderao^s death I was ar rested and thrown into prison. I was kept in a dark room in the Fouzdaree for 6 months; during this interval I was called to Hariba Dada's house three times. On the first occa sion I was called by Bulwuntrao Yeshwnnt, and was desired to sign a paper on a promise of being released. To procure my release I signed the paper, but I was not allowed to read it nor I was released. On the second occasion another paper was given to me to sign by Bulwuntrao Yeshwunt. On looking at the paper I saw that it was a deposition, and I requestedSCHEDULE No. II— that it might be read. Bulwuntrao Yeshwunt refused and threatened me with torture if I did not sign. Under this compulsion I signed. On the third occasion also my signature was taken under similar circumstances. On another occasion my signature was forcibly taken by Narayenbhai Laloobhia. In June 1871 Bulwuntrao Yeshwunt became Fouzdar, and lie ordered me to be put in irons and taken to jail. I remained in jail for nearly 3| months. I have never been tried for any offence, nor questioned by any one except on the occasions abovementioned. My release was procured in September 1871, my son-in-law Motilal Ruvchund having paid_ Es. 15,000 I then went to live in Ahmedabad and was forbidden to go to Baroda. Owing to my imprisonment and to the subsequent prohibition against my entering Baroda, I have suffered very serious loss. I have been imprisoned without any charge whatever through the enmity of the four following members of the Durbar :— Bulwuntrao Yeshwunt. Nanajee Yeshwunt. Hariba Dada. Narayenbhai. ' I claim from the Durbar compensation as follows:— Rs. 15,000, the sum paid for my release by my son-in-law; Rs, 5,000, for false imprisonment and other injury ; Rs. 20,000, for outstanding debts unrecovered in consequence of my ex pulsion from Baroda; personal property confiscated by the Durbar, Rs. 5,000.' 51 Case of Luxmibai, widow of the late The statement of the petitioner is as follows :— Mulharba Sheik ee, | My late husband was a confidential servant of the late Maharajah Khunderao. He was possessed of considerable property amounting to Rs. 1^26,000, including immoveable property and one inam village, as per list annexed. He had been in the service of the Gaekwar in a confidential position for upwards of 40 years. About a month after Khunderao died, my husband was arrested in connection with an alleged attempt to burn down the Havelee. When my husband was imprison ed an attachment was placed on the house, aod I was not allowed to leave it. About one month after I was so confined, all my husband's property was taken away, and I was left without anything, except a few maunds of grain. Five months subsequently I was turned out of my house, which is given to Damodur Punth. He is now in possession of my house. About nine months after my husband was imprisoned, a sepoy came to me and told me that my husband was dead, and that I was to come and take my husband's body away. I followed the sepoy and found the body just outside the jail. I asked no questions but took the body away. The colour of the body was changed^ and there was a most offensive smell. From the change of colour and from the offensive smell both I and all my relations believed that death had not occurred from natural causes. Since my husband's death I am left utterly destitute. I ha^ e no means of support. I pray that justice may be done to me for my husband's wrongful impri' sonment, and that my husband's property may be restored to me. | 52 Case of Bhagirathee, Gunoo Waoh. wife of the late The statement of the petitioner is as follows:— My husband was a confidential servant of the late Maharajah Kaunderao.

Gaekwar and was possessed of considerable property amount ing to about Rs. 3,54,000, including immoveable property and one Inam village. All this property was amassed during the reign of Gunputrao and Khunderao Gaekwars. My husband was arrested in connection with an alleged at tempt to burn down the Havelee. When my husband was imprisoned an attachment was placed on the house, and I was not allowed to leave it. A fortnight after I was imprisoned, all my property was taken away^ and I was left utterly desti tute. About four months after my husband had been thrown into prison^ I received notice from a sepoy that my husband had died at Eaopara Chabutra. I went there with about 25 relations to take away my husbands'body. I noticed that the colour of the body was changed in an unnatural way. I have no reasonable doubt from the appearance of the body that my husband did not die from natural causes. I and my relations took away my husband's body : we were accom panied by sepoys. I am utterly destitute, and I pray that justice may be done to me, and that my husband's property be restored to jne. My house valued at Rs. 15^000 has been given to one Sekhjee, a favorite of the present Maharajah. My garden, valued at Rs. 75,000, has been given to Bal- vuntrao Eshvant, Fouzdar, and is now in his possession. The case of these petitioners appears from the statement made by Parvati Bai:—' Shortly after the death of the late Maha rajah Khunderao, my husband, Bhow Scindia, was arrested and placed in confinement; an attachment was placed on his house ; and all my jewels and personal property were attached at the same time. I and Gungabai were kept in strict con finement ; first at our own house, and then at Omkareshwur Temple; a guard was placed at the door, and no one but my own people were allowed to approach me, nor was I allowed to speak with any one else. I and Gungabai were kept in confinement in this way for 21 months, viz., from November 1870 to August 1872. My personal property or stridhun which I received from my late husband and from Maharajah Khunderao exceeded 2 lacs of rupees. The whole of my stridhun has been taken away from me, together with my late husband's effects. The same thing has happened to Gungabai. I have committed no fault whatever that I should thus suffer forfeiture. With the exception of our inam village, Devurganr, in Nasik^ every thing that I had has been taken from me. A suit has been filed against me in the Nasik Civil Court by Haree Bhugtee for this remaining property. I remember coming up to the Resi dent in the month of August 1872. I was accompanied to the Residency by a Government Karkoon. At the Residency I met Balvuntrao Eshvant, Fouzdar; the Fouzdar told us what to say when the Saheb should question us. The Fouzdar said unless I said this I should get into trouble. I was afraid from what the Fouzdar said. I therefore concealed from the Saheb the imprisoment and hardship to which I have been subjected with Gungabai. After seeing the Saheb we were allowed to depart; and I and Gungabai went by rail to Bombay. In Bombay I asked Gopalrao Myral's Bombay Manager regarding a sum of Rupees one lac which have been deposited in my name by Bhow Scindia in Gopalrao Myral's banking house in Bombay. I was verbally informed by Gopalrao Myral's Mooneem in Bombay that I could not get a pie of this money.

I and Gungabai are left destitute with the exception of ouri inam village at Nasik. Of this village the Durbar is tryW to dispossess us by causing suits to be filed against us. I p ra y that our stridhun may be restored to us according to Hindoo Law, and that justice may be done. The petitioners have made the following statement of their case :— We were followers of the late Maharajah Khunderao, and were employed as orderlies in his personal service, on salaries of Es. 9 per mensem. We have served for three months with the present Maharajah. We were dismissed from our employ ment under the following circumstances:—About three months after the late Maharajah died, we were sent for by Bapoo Saheb and Sudasew, Karkoon of Venkutrao Master, and were sum moned to the Fouzdaree. Bulvuntrao Eshvimt was then Fouzdar, but he asked us no questions ; he told us to go to Sudasew. Dowlutram_, Fouzdaree Karkoon, was with Sudasew; and these two persons questioned us regarding an alleged conspiracy against the life of the present Maharajah by Bhow Scindia, Moonshee Hubeeboola, and Jumnabae Ranee. We were told that if we would confess that we were instigated by these three persons to attempt the life of the Maharajah, we should receive no harm whatever, and should receive Rs. 500 a piece. We all three replied that we knew nothing about the matter and would not say what they desired. We were kept in the Fouzdaree in imprisonment for about two months, and were questioned at intervals, and a confession was attempted to be extorted from us. As we refused to give the required confession, we were sent from the Fouzdaree and were placed in three separate police guards. We were each of us fined Rs. 500. These fines we have each of us paid. We have since been left destitute and have lost our employment in the Government service. We were old servants ofthe. State, and pray that we may be re-instated, and that our fines may be remitted us as we have committed no fault.' The following statement has been made by the petitioner:— I have been in the Gaekwar's service for 30 years. Soon after the late Maharajah Khunderao's deaths I was imprisoned with several others on a charge of setting fire to the Havelee. The charge is utterly false. I was arrested at night-time, and the next morning sent off to jail and heavily ironed. The same day Jossood Sugujee, Patel's son, came to me and said that if I gave evidence charging Mulharba Shelkee, Gunnoo Wagh, and Kooshaba Chutrivalla with the offence of setting fire to the Havelee, I should be released. I refused to make such a false admission. Two days subsequently Narayenrao Mon- ghay, Fouzdar, came to the jail and desired me to make an admission as above. On my refusing to do so, the Fouzdar replied that I would have to remain in prison till my death. A week subsequently Dowlutram, Fouzdaree Karkoon^ again came to jail, and again attempted to extort an admission froifl me as above, but without success. No trial took place and no proceedings were recorded in my presence. I have been confined for nearly three years and was only released on the occasion of the last eclipse of the moon.

In submitting to the notice of the Com mission the petitions of sixty-seven subordinate followers of the late Mahra- jah Khunderao, complaining of wholesale deprivation of allowances and loss of service, the Resident deems it right to state that it is the policy and good faith rather than the legality of the measure which he calls in question. Such wholesale deprivation of old servants on the occasion of a new Chief is unprece dented in Baroda, and, when taken with the systematic imprisonment and spolia tion of the more prominent followers of the late Mahrajah, the treatment of the subordinate followers appear to exhibit a mere picture of heartless persecution and wanton abuse of authority. This persecution was the result of enmity on the part of His Highness the present Maharajah.

Kussun dass left three widows who are his sole heirs ; of these three widows one only Kussundass had issue, a daughter named Suraj ; this daughter isallegedto be the reversionary heir to the estate of the deceased Kussundass; and the petitioner, who is her husband, claims on' behalf of herself and an infant son, Apajee. Kussundass had an elder brother named Rugabhai, who died 88 vears a^o, leaving two widows and a daughter.

On the death of Kussundass, in 1869, one Lrdlpo, grandson of Hetal petitioned the Durbar that the property in question was heir- ■ less property, although at the time Kussundass had three widows and a daughter living, the daughter i» question being the wife of the present petitioner. The petitioner alleges that his son, Apajee, the grandson of Kussundass, was formally recognised by the present Govern ment as heir to the estate, and that the usual dress of honor was sent to him on the completion of Kussundass' funeral ceremonies. He also states that he was forcibly compelled to pay a nuzerana of Rs. 15,000 in order to procure the formal recognition of Government. This nuzerana was sulv sequently refunded to petitioner, and a nuzerana of 40,000 was accepted by the present Government from his of ponent, Lulloo Toolshee, who was placed in possessoin of the property, and was recognized by the Government as heir to the estate of the deceased Kussundass. This descision of Government is alleged to be in direct contravention of the ordinary law prevailing in the Gaekwar's dominions, and to the result of corrupt influence on the part of the highest officials in the State. Petitioner prays that his valuable estate may be restored to him, and that he may be declared the lawful heir to the estate of the deceased Kussundass.i 44 '■Mr SCHEDULE No. I.— Complaints of Baroda Subjects.

ItEMAKKS. The following statement has been made by the petitioner I am Goomasta of the firm of Choonilall Dulcharam, Banker ! Choonilall has firms in Baroda, Ahmedabad, Visnagar Pahlunpur, Patun, Bombay, and Dhollera. Choonilall is on bad terms with Bulwuntrao Eshwunt, the present Sir Fouzdar' of Police. I am in charge of Choonilall's firm in Baroda An attachment was placed on my firm by Bulwuntrow Esh wunt in January 1871, and all our papers, &amp;c., were removed to Bulwuntrow Eshwunt's private house. When His HigHness Khunderow died in November 1870, Bulwunt Eshwunt was a prisoner in his own house by Khunderow's orders. Kara- yenrao Babajee was then Fouzdar, and Bulwuntrow Eshwunt had no criminal jurisdiction as Fouzdar. I do not know- by what authority he attached my firm. This attachment was ^placed on my firm on account of a certain sum of Rs. 5,000 which I was said to have received on behalf of one Prema Itcha. I had not received this sum, nor was there any entry in my accounts of this sum having been received. Bulwuntrow Eshwunt told me to confess that the amount in question had been received by me from Bhow Scindia. ' I refused to do so. I was then urged to confess that the | amount rn question had been offered to me by Bhow Sciu- i [ re ^ u,se&lt; -' confess as it was false. I was then forced by Bulwuntrow Eshwunt to sign a statement to the above ! effect under threats of being sent to jail: under this compul sion I signed. Another statement was also exacted from me i under similar compulsion. This took place about one or two months after Khunderao's death. The attachment was maintained over my shop, and I was kept under surveillance or about nine months*not being allowed to leave my house. iy e moiiths after I had been placed in confinement, I was ordered by Bulwuntrow Eshwunt, who had been made Fouz dar m the interim, to pay a fine of Rs. 15,000. This fine was no paid. An attachment was therefore placed on the firm m Visnagar in order to realize this amount.

No reply been received to this yad. The following is the statement of the petitioners case as made by himself:— f My father was Moonim of Hurree Bugtee's firm; so was my grand-father ; my father died three years ago. For one year I was Moonim of Huree Bu^tee. f j Snmvut 1922 T ad. 1865-66j His Highness Mulharrao borrowed from my father Rs. 1,281-4-0 through his Jamda, Luxmonrao. His Highness sent a chit for this loan^ which was in our posses sion. A gold watch was pledged by His Highness for the loan. On His Highness' succession to the throne, His Highness sent Jasood to my house and sent for the watch and the note above referred to. I took them to him. They were taken from me, and His Highness said that one Raojee Athwalya would settle my account. I went to Raojee^ but he said that I would not get back my money. I then spoke to His Highness who told me not to go to him but to Raojee. Raojee refused payment, and orders were given by His Highness not to allow me to go to him. In consequence of this, our hereditary allowances and inam villages have been resumed, viz,— Torch allowance, Rs. 72 per annum^ granted in Anundrrao Gaek- war^s time. Palunquin allowance, Rs. 700^, per annum re-granted in Syajee- rao's time,, Sumvut 1890, a.d. 1833-34. Inam village named Fazulpur, valued about Rs. 2^000_, granted in His Highness Khunderao's time. I hold sunuds for all these. I pray that my allowance and inam village may be restored to me, and the amount due to me by His Highness Mulharrao may be ordered to be paid to me. ?? Case of Deenshaw ^Darasha, Parsee^ of The petitioner's case appears from the following statement:— An ancestor of mine named Bomunjee Muncherjee, purchased certain 'vujifas,' or inam holdings in the Kamrej^ Bulesur^ Tiiladi, and Vussrani Mahals of the Nowsari Purgunnah, in i Sumvut 1860 ^ the year i^risoa-f ioese vajnas are not wuttun or ser vice lands, but common alienated property. The pur chase was confirmed by sunud of Anundrao Gaekwar, dated Shravun Shood 14th, Sumvut 1866. I produce the original sunud of confirmation. The present annual income from these vujifas is about Rs. 6,000, representing at 20 years' purchase a value of Rs. 1,20,000. Bomunjee died in 1835, leaving no lineal descendants after having mortgaged the whole property to Gopalrao Myral for Rs. 12^,977. Bomunjee's brother, Sorabjee, succeeded him, in virtue of a deed passed by 12 G K Surat, on behalf of the heirs of the late Maneckbai, daughter of Muncherjee, Ghudecalee. /46 SCHEDULE No. II.— o t&gt; ^ ^ if i.s i M Remarks. _ c3 ^2 ^ s • § § socisp? .• ^ goo-? g o . c3 o o 54 Question of prison reform in the Baroda State, including the several prisons in the city of Baroda and in the districts. Bomunjee's widow, Kooverbai, the original of which I produce, Sorabjee was entitled to succeed to the property as heir-in-law on Kooverbai's decease. Sorabjee was formally recognized by the Baroda Government and received a Poshak. Sorabjee managed the property for about 15 years, and subsequently transferred the whole of his interest in the said property to his own sister, Maneckbai. The original deed of transfer I produce, dated November 5th, 1850. ' Under the terms of the original mortgage bond made between Bomunjee and Gopalrao Myral, the management was to remain with the mortgagor, and the mortgagee was to receive annually a fixed sum. When the attachment was imposed in a balance of about Rs. 8,000 was due to Gopalrao Myral under the said bond. From the year 1850 to 1858 Maneckbai managed the property in virtue of the deed of transfer made to her by Sorabjee On the death of Maneckbai, 1858, the management passed into the hands of Maneckbai's children, who retained it for two years, viz., to 1860, when an attachment was imposed by the Burhar on the pretext that Bomunjee died leaving no blood descend ants ; although Bomunjee left no descendants, he left one brother and one sister, both of whom are entitled to inherit. I ' From the time that the property was attached in 186D, the management has remained in the hands of Government. The income of this land was placed in deposit with Hurree Bhugtee from the year 1860 to 1869 inclusive. In 1869 the whole of the land under attachment was confiscated on the same pretext as that for which the land was originally attached. From 1860 to 1869 the case remained undecided. The order for confiscation was passed when Bulwuntrao Yeshvant was Sooba of Nowsari. I pray that the property may be at once released from the attachment, and the proceeds placed in deposit with Hurree Bhugtee be paid over to us at once, together with any subsequent realizations.' Referring to the alleged practice of flogging women in the Baroda jail, as stated in the evidence recorded under No. 45 of this schedule, the Resident has the honour to bring the subject under the notice of the Commission separately, with a view to the Durbar being requested to state whether the practice exists or not, and what measures they propose to adopt regarding it. The Resident spoke to the Durbar Regard ing the practice some time ago, and the Sir Fouzdar, Bulwunt rao Yeshwunt, promised that if it existed, it should be stopped. The practice can be proved by the reliable testimony of men who have been thrown into prison for no other crime than that they were favourite followers and dependants of His High ness the late Maharajah Rhunderao—men who have lost all their property thereby, but not their characters as faithful servants of the Baroda State, dating in some cases from the time of His Highness Syajeerao. Other evidence, however, can be produced if requisite. That the practice of flogging females exists in the districts apj peared in the Visnagar and Putan torture cases. In latter, as originally brought to the notice of the Durbar by the Resident, two women were stated to have been flogged by the authorities in public Kutcherry under disgusting circuin-j stances for the mere purpose of extorting confession from them-48 SCHEDULE No. Complaints of Baroda Subjects.

The substance of the petition is as follows; it is signed by 22 men:— &amp; ^ I ' We made a petition to the Resident about our assessment and the oppression committed on us, and having been allowed to go home by the Resident we returned. The Taloohdar of the village, V&amp;telNarayanjee Doolule, &amp;c, and Talatee Mathoora- dass Narrayendass, sent for us and told us that now we had made a petition to the Resident we should have to go to the British^ districts. So saying they commenced to commit oppression on us. Mohsuls were issued, although no arrears * i C \ Ue ^ i0m us ^ our ca ttle were pounded; access to water tor bidden ; and Dhairs were made to sit at our houses, and we were made to suffer much inconvenience. We left our houses secretly by night and have come to the British village of V aracha.

Hope from the person, as per margin was, delivered at the Residency on the 2nd instant (December 1873), viz ' The Gaekwar Government commits oppression on the ryots of the Tailoii I uppa. Ihe appointment of the Wywutdar is held by Narayanrao Raghonath's son, a boy of 8 years old, and the work is carried on in his name by Lalloo Lala, who com mitted great oppression on us. At present, the people were preparing to come to Baroda to complain, and several of them have been imprisoned in consequence, viz., Lulloo Nuthoo, of Sondulpur, Lalla Doolubbhaee, Naranjee Bhaidass, and several others, whose names we do not know, but we have got a paper signed by numbers of men. We made our escape and have come here to complain. Some of the runaways were seized and 10 or 15 of us have secretly left at night, and have come here, because if we do not represent over grievances we shall continue in the same miserable condition. AVe have come with only our clothes on, and pray you will be so kind as to record our depositions regarding over grievances. Now that we have come here, we hope you will be so kind as to arrange to prevent the which is We cannot return without some arrangement. Similar obstruction appears to have been offered to the ryots of Mundala, in the Dubhoe Purgunna, as appears from a petition received in the Resident's Office. Petition from the Ryots of 6 villages of Another instance has just occurred ; it is reported in the following the Bullesur Purganna, Nowsari. petition from the ryots of Oomruck, Gangpur, Soyanee, Bar- shada, Jutpurda, and Vanesha. Pistad, of the Balesur Pur gunna, Nowsari District, signed by 26 persons, who represent that organized attempts are being made by Durbar officials to prevent their coming to Baroda to lay their grievances before the Commission. They state in substance as follows;— That at the present time Dessai Mukunjee, son of Govind Neecha, Desai of Pulsana and Kharbaree of the Balesur Purgunna, and' the other Kharbarees, Gossai Bhai, Rugha Vushnu, and other Dessais visit their villages by day and night to prevent them from appearing before the British Government to represent their grievances; that the said officials forcibly take their sig natures to writings prepared by themselves; that they have made a petition about this to the Gaekwar Government, but that they do not think it probable that on that petition their grievances will be redressed, they therefore submit this petition to the Resident. They state that from the time that Govind Neecha became Wywutdar and Kharbaree in their Purgunnas, and the sur vey was introduced, the said Govind Neecha has treated them oppressively, and they were obliged to consider him as the Gaekwar himself and no one would listen to their complaints. British officials visit their districts and redress grievances on the spot; the petitioners plead that no one comes to them for that purpose. They complain that the assessment is very high, that prices have fallen, and therefore that the assessment should be reduced and the re-marriage tax done away with. Govind Neecha and other Dessais should be prevented from going into the dis tricts and causing discontent and exacting forced labour. They further complain that their credit with the sowkars is at an end, owing to their extreme poverty. Their sons remain unmarried, and that they are starving; after paying the Go vernment assessment they declare that they have not even a sufficient quantity of grain left for food, and consequently they are in a miserable plight. 13 G E50 SCHEDULE No. II.— Complaints of Baroda Subjects. Remarks. Continuation of the instances of oppres sion now being carried out by the Gaekwar officials in the Nowsari Dis trict. The case of these women was submitted in case No. 30 of this schedule, but under the orders of the Commission ; No. 20, dated 26th November 1873, pro hibiting inquiry into the details of the revenue administration, it was not gone into. Their importunity in complaining to all the British authorities now at Baroda has led to this record of their case. Note. —It appears on inquiry that the husbands of these women originally held land in their village under a 10 years' lease. Some of them died; others deserted the country. The Dur bar re-let the land to other people ; but still hold the widows and families of the original deceased or absent holders, responsible for any loss they profess to sustain by re-letitng the said land. It should also be noted that it is the principal officials of the Nowsari District who were concerned in violating our ^ extra dition laws, by seizing the Parsee Bapoojee Cursetjee in the limits of the Surat Zilla. . . The proceedings of the Baroda Durbar in Nowsari m connec tion with their proclamation enjoining general abstinence from animal food during the month of August last are worthy of consideration, as showing an intolerant spirit, a desire to interfere with the civil liberty of other castes than Hindoos^ such as ParseeSj Mahomedans, &amp;c. 7 and finally unnecessary delay in countermanding the obnoxious orders after a promise had been given to the Tiesident to do so without delay. On the 20th December, a number of widows, &amp;c., of the village of Wurriow, in the Nowsari District, appeared before the Commission,' by order of the Resident. These poor people have been wandering about Baroda for more than a month past. The Resident interested the Minister on their behalf not long since, and it was arranged that they should return home to have their grievances redressed by the Wywutdar, Data Govind. They have now returned again to complain that nothing has been done for them. ^ , I At the request of the President of the Commission, the Resi dent, accompanied by Mr. Bapoobhai, the Durbar Agent, pre sent, went outside the Committee room, to speak to the per sons in question, when itwas arranged that the Wywutdar Data Govind should be summoned to Baroda to state their case. In the meantime they have themselves made the following statements before the Resident :— ^ M 1st Ibrahim Bhai Meya, a Borah, residing in Wurriow village, of the Nowsari District, who has been acting as Agent for these people, states as follows on solemn affirmation:— For the last four years I have been petitioning the Durbar^ on behalf of the women now present. All my representations have been made to the Sir Sooba; I have always been refer red by him to the Sooba of Nowsari, and by the latter to the Wywutdar of Wurrione, who refused to take any notice of my representations; this treatment has been adopted for the last four or five years. I have also petitioned the Resident on more than one occasion, but I have always been referred to the Durbar. . T When therefore we heard of the arrival of the Commission 1 came with the petitioners to lay their grievances personally before the Commission. I first made a representation to the Resident about a month ago who mentioned their case both to the Mahrajah and t e Minister. The Minister took us away and told us to go to Hurriba. Hurriba gave me a written order to take to the Sooba of Nowsari; this order I delivered to the Soobas Karkoon named Bulwantrow; the Karkoon read it, endorse it, and asked me to take it to the Wywutdar at Wurno^- I delivered it in person to the Wywutdar at Wurriow. e said that it contained no order whatever, and told me to ta e the petitioners away. He said that he would write to ^ Sooba about it. I had no confidence in what he said, an therefore I came again to Baroda to represent this case. Wurriow is 50 coss from here, and the petitioners nave travelled this long distance twice to get a hearing. I P ra ^| that justice may be done there. (Signed) Baroda, 20^ December 1873. Before me, A.

I was security for her husband who died in 1924. When he died there was no outstanding balance due from him. He held about 28 bigas of land. Nanee gave a razi- nama for this land to Fuquir Mehta as soon as her husband died. Notwithstanding this razinama I was ordered by the Wywutdar, Dayabhai, to pay assessment for the following year, Sumvut 1925. I protested, saying that the land was no longer in Nanee's possession^ and that she had given a razinama for it. Notwithstanding my protest I was ordered to pay^ and because I refused I was put in a cage for three days and was kept in the Kutcherry for nine days. I was then threaten ed with imprisonment in fetters if I did not pay up. Under this compulsion I paid Rs. 52 in sumvut 1925. In sum vut 1926 I paidRs. 45 under similar compulsion. In sumvut 1927 I paid Es. 50 under the same compulsion. In sumvut 1928 I paid altogether Rs. 112-2-3 on account of the same land under similar compulsion.. Each separate payment was made under protest and was only extorted from me by im prisonment and threats of personal injury. The whole amount so paid up to the year sumvut 1929 wasabout Rs. 319 as shown in the accompanying memorandum marked A. I had recovered this sum from the widow, and the unjust extortion from me has thus been transferred to her. Nanee's husband took up the land in the year sumvut 1921 for ten years. I gave security for ten years. ' ^nd, Hansa Boo, wife of Jewa Hooseinjee, residing at Wurriow, states the circumstances of her own grievance as follows:— i -u Mv husband is imbecile; he has no khata, but my husband^s lather cultivated about 6 bigas of land. My husbands father died 10 years ago. I do not know whether he cultivated on lease or not. I have nothing to do for my father-in-law, and my husband has never cultivated any land. Notwithstanding I am held responsible by the Sirkar for the assessment on the land formerly cultivated by my deceased father-in-law. The Sirkar has no sort of claim on me. ^ I have paid on account of this land no less than Rs. 250, although thelandhas been given by the Sirkar to some one else to cultivate. I have been stripped of everything that I had, and have been left utterly destitute. I have been put into the wooden cage and have been subjected to the greatest indignity. &gt; .

My husband then died, and I again offered a razinama and it was again refused. I therefore ran away to Rander, a British village. My property was then all attached, including my house, and has remained so for the last three years. The Go vernment now claims from me about Rs. 200 which I am un able to pay. The money which I paid was recovered in this way.

He cultivated 4 bigas of khalsa land. There was no outsanding balance against him at the time of his death. My husband returned from a voyage to my town in Sl ™ and was by imprisonment forced to accept the said land for cultivation. When my husband died, I went with a razinama to the Kutcherry; the Karkoon, Nagurdass, refused to accept it, so I left the paper in the Kutcherry, and deserting Wurriow went to Rander. | Notwithstanding this_, I was held responsible for the assess- 1 ment Pressure was placed on my husband's security^ Ahmed$ 55 (B SCHEDULE No. II.— Complaints of Baroda Subjects.

Tlie late Bhow Scindia was convicted of bribery and other offences in the month of May 1871, and was sentenced to imprisonment for two years. Bhow Scindia was possessed of very considerable property, amounting to many lakhs of rupees. The exact amount of this property cannot be accurately ascertained, as the whole of Bhow Scindia's papers have been seized by the Durbar, and are now in their possession. The value of the property- has been variously estimated at from 30 to 50 lakhs of rupees. The whole of this property was attached by the Durbar, to meet the alleged claims of Bhow Scindia's creditors^ which are stated by the Durbar to amount to Es. 4,07,855, exclusive of Government demands amounting to Rs. 1,21,223, making a total of Rs. 5,29,078. Petitions have been received from the following creditors of the late Bhow Scindia^, stating that although they have pro cured decrees in their favour against the estate of the late Bhow Scindia, they are unable to obtain execution:— 1. Haree Bhagtee, for Rs. 2,42,585. 2. Jumnadass Jagjivan, forRs. 12,332. 3. Nurotum Ladha, for Rs. 1,637. 4. Lulloo Gungaram, for Rs. 570. 5. Hurgowind Vunmalee^, for Rs. 441. 6. Wuruglall Shivlall, for Rs. 1,400. 7. Narayen Runchod, for Rs. 3^672. 8. Koohr Mhoruin, for Rs, 1,042. It is stated by the widows of the late Bhow Scindia, who are his immediate heirs, that they have been deprived of the whole of their stridhan, or personal property, together with the effects of their deceased husband. Apart from the question of the amount of stridhan to which they may be entitled, it is clear that the heirs of the late Bhow Scindia are entitled to the possession of any property in excess of the debts for which the said property was attach ed. Not only, however, have the chief creditors of the late Bhow Scindia been left unpaid, but the whole of an immense pro perty has been simply appropriated by the State to the pre judice of the heirs, who are left utterly destitute. The origi nal attachment was imposed on the ground of Bhow Scindia's indebtedness, but the attachment has been subsequently used to defraud the heirs and creditors, and to give the Durbar an opportunity of confiscating the whole of this vast inheri tance.

He resided chiefly in the Residency garden at Baroda from May last to the time of his death, owing to the fact of the firm in the city of Baroda being under attachment, together w T ith the whole of the property of the firm. Motilal made the following statement of his case before the Resident at the end of last May. It was supported by two witnesses who are still alive :— The present head of the firm is the infant son of Motilal; the Manager is Motilal's son-in-law, Trikumlall Mooktyar. This case was originally entered by the Resident in Schedule No. I v British Subjects, but it has been transferred to this schedule by order of the Baroda Commission. It is respectfully submitted that under the exceptional circumstances which have occurred under the present admi nistration of the Gaekwar State, the interests of the British subjects residing in, or having commercial relations with, the Baroda Government, are not ade quately protected, and that they have no means of redress open to them, ex cept that afforded by the present Com mission, the advice of the Resident to do justice to these persons having been rejected. The connection of the firm with the Gaek war State, as State Bankers, was an nulled by the present Maharajah soon after his accession to the throne, but no settlement of accounts has been effected. The firm of Samul Bechur and Co. has been in existence at Baroda for the last century and upwards, during which they have been employed as Bankers of the Gaekwar, which con tinued up to August 1872—Sumvut 1928, Shravun Sood 5, the whole of the property of the firm having been placed under attachment from the 6th idem up to the present time.' The cause of this sudden suspension of the extensive business of the firm is explained as follows :— 15 g k General circumstances of each case. About the year 1923 ( a.d . 1868) a Goomasta named Motilal Jeyta was discharged by the firm for misconduct in having made away with certain documents. This man shortly after his dismissal went and laid false information before His* Highness the Maharajah Khunderao, to the effect that if the old books of the firm for Sumvut 1885 ( a.d . 1829) were examined, a sum of Rs. 64,000 would be found to be due to the Gaek war State, on account of the Korul Purgunnah, which had been leased to the firm for five years, viz., from Sumvut 1877 to 1882. His Highness Khunderao at once sent for the petitioner, Motilal Samul, who explained the matter satisfac torily to His Highness, who took no further notice of it, and the matter dropped. About four years after this H. H. Khunderao died, and the present Gaekwar came to the throne, when the aforesaid Goomasta, Motilal Jeyta, renewed his information in Sumvut 1928 (May 1872). At this time the head of the firm, Motilal Samul, was absent at Ahmedabad, where he had gone to be present at the marriage of his daughter. A Goomasta named Motilal Purshotum was in charge of the firm in Baroda ; and a mohsul was at once imposed on the firm by order of the Durbar, with instructions that the Banker was to settle all current accounts with the Furnees. Motilal Samul on hearing this at once proceeded to Baroda and waited upon His Highness the Maharajah, and asked him why the mohsul had been imposed on the firm. His Highness told me to make up my accounts with the Furnees. This was about June last year. I then told the Maharajah that my Goomasta, Motilal Purshotum, had already been to the Furnees about the accounts, and that the Furnees had told him that Rs. 50,000 was to be paid to the State on account of Baee Judal, the widow of Runchore, as awarded by His Highness Khun- derao; but that I declined to pay such Rs. 50,000, because/ I 58 SCHEDULE No. III. — continue Names of Claimants, &amp;c.

On hearing this the Maharajah said he would ask the Furnees, and told me to come the following day. I accoril mgly went and the Maharajah told me that I was indebted to the Sirkar and must show my books of^ 1885 to Wussunl ram Bhow, his private servant. Accordingly Wussuntram Bhowcame to my house and took such notes as he required from my Cash Book and Ledger of 1885. About a week after this I was sent for by His Highness to the Motee Bagh, and after salam, I was told to talk to Wussuntram Bhow about the money duQ under the Ledger (Khata) of 1885. Wussuntrani ^ then said that lowed four lacs, including interest, to the Gaek- j war Government; that His Highness would remit one lac, but that the remaining three must be paid at once. I replied that I owed nothing to the Sirkar, and if there were any accounts with the Sirkar to prove such a debt, they must be shown to me. Wussuntram then said^ your own accounts show the debt^ and we order you to pay. I then replied that the accounts about the Korul Purgunna had been adjusted in Sumvut 1889 (a.d. 1833) in Syajeerao's time^, so that nothing was due, and at the same time the agreement marked A was shown to Wussuntram Bhow, who said that as the parties to the document were dead, the document itself was dead. He then said, ' act according to the wishes of the Sirkar and give Bts a chit for Rupees 1J lacs.' I replied that I had not committed fc \m Palanquin and other hereditary honours and allowances confiscated. iThe whole business of the firm stopped since August 1872, ostensibly for the On the 5 reasons stated in Motilal Samul deposition.

Wassunt- ram then went in to the Maharajah and shortly after called me into his presence. The Maharajah told me to do as Wussunt-i ram told me, and that by so doing I should obtain the favour of His Highness, and would obtain good advantage. I replied that I would serve His Highness to the best of my ability, but that I could not pay the large sum demanded. I then came home. After this a day oi two, Wussuntram came twice to my house, and desired me to give the note for 1| lacs. He also used to call the Goomasta, Motilal Purshotum, and Bhicajee Punt Narayen for the same purpose. Wussuntram told the latter that if he did not persuade his master to sign the note for one and a half lacs, his shop would be attached and all would suffer. After some time on Shravun Sood 3rd, when I was goiiig to see the Temple of Nurssagee, in Baroda, I was prevented by Wassuntrams sepoy, who told me to come to his master. I said that I would go to the temple first and then go to his master. The sepoy said you must come first, oi I will take y oU ; by force ; so I was obliged to follow him to the Sirkar s Have-: lee to Wussuntram's office. The latter told me in a threaten- ing tone that he had frequently warned me to write the chn for the 11 lacs, and that if I would not do so, I should he dis-l honoured. I then returned home. j Shravun Sood I had been to the station to see Mr. Taylor, Barrister, and Mr. Bhaishunker, a Clerk of Messrs. Jefferson, Payne, &amp; Co., Solicitors of the High Court, and having to consult them regarding my suit against the Trading ; Company, I took a ticket for Broach and satin the same carn age as Bhaishunker, there not having been time to speak to him at the station. At the same time when starting I saw my j nephew, Tricumlal, in the same train, who informed me t a my wife at Ahmedabad was ill with dengue fever. In ^ j ml ofth ki59 SCHEDULE No. 111.—continued. Names of Claimants, &amp;c. General circumstances of each case. This is one of the first cases which I had to discuss with the Gaekwar Govern ment on my arrival at Baroda. I had several interviews with the Minister regarding it, and one with His High ness the Gaekwar and Minister to gether. I was told by them that Colonel Shortt had considered the whole case, and that though the Government claim ed 1^ lacs of rupees from the firm, they had agreed to accept Rs. 75 ; 000 in settlement of all demands. This they said had been Colonel Shortt's discussion. The firm denied that they had agreed to that decision, affirming that several items in the State Loan account were not acknowledged, though bond fide transactions. I searched in vain for any record of Colonel Shortt's proceedings in the case^, and I therefore repeatedly begged that a fair inquiry into the accounts might take place with a view to settlement. This was pro mised, but never performed. Bond fide debts to the firm by the State were as far as I could see deliberately repudi ated by His Highness and the Minister. I believe myself that if just claims are admitted, the balance will be in favour of the firm, which has been ruined by the apparently arbitrary and unjust course adopted by His Highness' ad ministration towards them. I was called upon to support Colonel Shortt' alleged decision without seeing the complete accounts od both sides which I declined to do. State Loan Account; sequence of this we returned from Kurjun^ and went in the mixed train to Ahmedabad. The next day, 6th Shravun Sood, the whole of my property was attached, information of which was communicated to me by my Goomasta, Motilall Purshotum, who, with Bhicaji, were confined for few hours. I should probably have left Baroda through fear of being imprisoned on account of the demand made against me; but the im mediate cause of my doing so was^ as above stated_, quite acci dental. I have branch shops at Ahmedabad and Bombay, the business of which have suffered considerably from this attachment. I at once exerted myself to avert the ruin which had come upon me^ and I mortgaged some of my jewels. Some creditors of mine living at Baroda came to me at Ahmeda bad and requested me to liquidate their claims. I told them that I would do so on the attachment being removed from my property. I then addessed a petition to Colonel Shortt, to which no reply was received. I then sent a second one^ to which Colonel Short replied that the matter being one of accounts, it must be settled with His Highness the Gaekwar ; and he sent for my Goomasta, Bhicaji Punt, and told him that he should call his master's Mooktyar, and that he would get the accounts privately settled. Bhicaji and Motilal on this came to Ahmedabad and told me what had taken place, sol sent my nephew, Tricumlal, as my Mooktyar to Baroda. (Signed) Before me_, K PHAYRE, Colonel, Resident.

I was called upon to settle accounts with the last part of June 1870, in the time of the Maharajah Khanderao,four or five months before his death. All the accounts were then settled with the exception of the State Loan account. This was not settled, because the Furnees required me on the part of the firm to credit to that account a sum of Rs 50,000 on account of Baee Judal, the widow of Runchore. I replied that I could not do anything without consulting my master; and moreover, that a decree in favour of our firm had already been given in that case by His Highness. Notwithstanding this, the Furnees entered the Rs. 50,000 in the State books without my concurrence ; but the account remained unsettled on our side. Matters remained in this state when His Highness the Gaekwar suddenly died, and the present Oaekwar came to the throne at the latter end of 1870. No settlement of accounts was called for in 1871; but in the month of May 1872, I was called by the Furnees to settle the accounts. I went with Bhicaji, Karkoon, and the first account examined was the loans account. I then said that I could not admit the Rs. 50,000 which had been arbitrarily entered by him therein. The Furnees told me that I must inform His High-60 j SCHEDULE No. 111.—continued. No. Names of Claimants. &amp;c. 185? 1867. General circumstances of each case. ness. All other current accounts were settled at that time. I told the Furnees that my master had gone to Ahmedabad for the celebration of his daughter's marriage, and that when he returned he would go to His Highness. A few days after this a mohsul was imposed on the firm of at first Rs. 1-4-0, afterwards Rs. 2-8-0. The head of the firm was informed of this, and he himself came to Baroda. After the issue of the mohsul, W r ussuntram Bhow, the private Accountant of His Highness the Maharajah, and who has charge of the Jamdarkhana and Shop of His Highness, came to our shop once or twice with one Gunputrao, a fellow- servant of his. He examined the books of 1885, and took from them such extracts as he required. Soon after this I accom panied my master, Motilal Samul, to the Moti Bagh to see His Highness the Maharajah ; Bhicaji Pant was also there. After making our salams to His Highness, we took our seats and Wussuntram Bhow came to us. I have heard my master's statement read out to me as to what occurred at the Moti Bagh, and it is correct I am aware of the fact that when my master was going to the temple he was compelled to go to the office of Wussuntram. know about the case of the Rs. 50,000. The original Samul Bechur's wife had a nephew named Runchore, who was about 11 or 12 years old, when he was murdered for the sake of his ornaments. This boy was married to Judal, the daughter of a poor Banya of Pithapur. There was also one Ghirdhurlal, the son of the Head Goomasta of the firm, called Bechur Nuthoo ; he was then about 25 years of age. It was resolved by the head firm, in order to facilitate the transaction of business, to establish a branch shop in Baroda under the names of Girda Runchore. The Head Goomasta of the princi pal firm managed both. The capital of the branch firm was about Rs. 50,000, which was paid partly by Bechur Nuthoo and partly by Samul Bechur. The books being under attach ment, the items cannot be given exactly. Runchore died in 1885-86. Within a year or so after this, Bechur Nuthoo was dismissed from the original firm for misconduct, and con sequently the affairs of the branch firm were wound up. In 1889 ( a.d . 1843), the widow of Judal gave an acquittance in full in regard to the use of the name of her husband, Motilall Samul, who was then proprietor of the firm, and a fixed maintenance was settled upon her. In Sumvut 1909 she was incited to complain in the Court of the Collector of Ahmed abad, that she had been deprived of her share in the firm of Girda Runchore and put off with a mere maintenance. The Collector sent her complaint with a letter to the then Resident who referred the matter to the Durbar, and the Durbar decided against her jlaim. Gunputrao was then on the throne. Judal renewed her claim again in 1867 to the Maharajah Ehunderao who passed a decree in our favour. In 1868, when the accounts were to be settled, the Furnees debited this Rs. 50,000 in the State Loan accounts, and it was ordered by His Highness Khunderao to be struck out on decree being shown. We have therefore resisted its entry into the accounts ever since. No. 3 Statement of Tricumlal MooJctyar.

Upon all this evidence, as also upon what subsequently passed at an interview which Ihad withbothH.H.the Gaekwar and the Minister upon this case, I formed the judgment that the object of both of them was not only to repu diate all State responsibility for certain claims put forward by the firm, but by attacking its valuable property to secure a considerable sum of ready cash alleged to be due to the State^ which sum the head of the firm said he would pay if on going thoroughly into the accounts it was proved to be due by him. This was often promised but never per formed, and the attachment was con tinned, because without a full settlement of accounts and the recognition on the part of the State of their bond fide re sponsibilities, the firm would not have had money enough to meet the demands of their creditors, on resuming business, 16 G B service to transact business of my own. I arrived at Baroda last September as the Agent of Motilall Samul in the case now under inquiry. We understood that Colonel Shorty the then Resident, required an Agent in the case. I saw Colonel Shortt on the day of my arrival, and he referred me to the Durbar for the settlement of accounts. I went and saw His Highness ; it was too late, and accounts were not settled then, but His Highnesss told me that I must settle accounts with the Furnees, and that the Sirkar would not forego their just claims. Some Vakeels and others called out that Govern ment should have their rights. I then said that in order to settle the accounts I ought to have certain papers connected with the accounts, and His Highness ordered the Fouzdar to give such papers as I required after taking my receipt for them. Next day, I got memoranda of the State Loan and current accounts. The third day, I went to the Furnees, as the Maharajah ordered me. I was accompanied by Motilall Purshotum and Bhicajee Punt. I asked the Furnees what account had to be settled. The Furnees asked what I had to say about the Rs. 50,000. I said that he was not entitled to the Rs. 60,000, and that he had no paper or document to support his claim of Rs. 50,000 against us, and that the deci sion had already been given in our favour by Khunderao Maharajah. The Karkoon of the Furnees then asked me three times whether I was going to give credit for Rs. 60,000 or not ? I said that it was not legal, and therefore that I could not do so. He then told me I must come to Wussuntram Bhow. We went to him., and Wussuntram Bhow, without any refer ence to the Rs, 50,000, said : ' your master has agreed to pass a note for Rs. 1,52,000, so you had better do so, other wise your Shett will be ruined.' I said that if my Shett had agreed to that there was no reason for my coming. He then told me that I ought to persuade the Shett to pass a note for 1| lacs when it would be good for him. I then said that my master was not a child that I could prevail on him to pass such an unjust note. I then took leave. On leaving he desired me to think of the matter and to answer next day. Early next day I was sent for by Wussantram, and I went with Motilall Purshotum and Bhicajee. When we went we were referred to the Furnees, and when we went to the Furnees we were referred back to Wussuntram. That day passed in that way. I always reported what happened to Colonel Shortt, and he told me to go back and tell the Durbar to settle the accounts. I was called on the third day and all three of us were taken upstairs to His Highness' bed-room, where threats were used by Wussuntram Bhow to induce us to persuade our Master to sign for 11 lacs. I refused: at about 11 a.m. that day we then were told not to go home ; that we were to be detained in custody in the Court of the Senaputti under a guard of peons. We said we were hungry at one o'clock when we were allowed to go home with two peons to get our dinner. Whilst thus engaged I managed to send a note to the Residency to inform Colonel Shortt how I was situated. After this we had to return to our place of confinement, and at 7 p.m. we were allowed to go for our supper guarded by two peons. After supper we were taken before the present Minister, Siva- jeerao Khondelkur. We then learnt that he had received a note from Colonel Shortt about us. The Minister asked us. why we complained to Colonel Shortt ; that we were merely detained for the settlement of accounts and were not confined. I said that Wussuntram did confine us. He denied it. We were then told to go,SCHEDULE No. 111.-—continued. Names of Claimants, &amp;c. Notwithstanding this I was expected to use my influence as Resident to persuade the head of the firm to credit the State with Rs. 75,000, without examining the accounts on both sides, which I of course declined to do. Thus the attachment has continued since August 1872—thus business has been stopped—thus rents unpaid, and their creditors ready to come them at any moment. Next day I come to Colonel Shortt and told him what happened, and Colonel Shortt then said, you need not,go to Wussuntram Bhow, but go to Nana Saheb, Minister. I did so on the following day, and I was told as I had been by Wussuntram Bhow. This was in September 1872, and mat ters are just the same now as they were then.

The Resident respectfully submits that case No. 1 of this schedule (Samul Bechur's) as well as this and others that will follow come within the scope of paras. 4 and 5 of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor Generals letter No. 2209 p ., dated Simla, 19th Septem ber 1873, wherein British subjects, including those resident in Baroda territory, whose welfare has been affected by the present extraordinary adminis tration of the Baroda State, are specified as fit objects for protection. See the next case No. 3, wherein Mug gunlal Huggumchund, of Ahmedabad, places the matter in a different light from that represented by the Minister, and claims 5 lacs of rupees as still due according to agreement. b is now very nearly three years since the jewels in question were purchased by His H ighness Mulharow on the occasion of his marriage. Every effort at obtaining a settlement having failed, the firm, as a last resource, deputed a mem ber of it, named Tarachund, from Ahmedabad, in September last, to represent the circumstances if necessary to the Eesi- ! dent. Tarachund first delivered letters to His Highness and the Dewan soliciting a settlement which was not effect ed. The Dewan first brought the case to the notice of the Resident, asking his advice about it; and subsequently Tarachund made his complaint. The case was then represented to the Maharajah in the following letter—a course that under ordinary circumstances would not have been followed, but which, in consequence of the rejection of the Residents j advice in the Banker Samul Bechur's and other important cases, became a matter of absolute necessity. I believe that | the representative of the firm Tarachund Wukkutchund has spoken the plain truth in his statement given below ; and if so, the commercial interests and relations between the Gaekwar and British States demand that such cases should be inquired into, with a view to ascertaining their real merits, especially as the Minister has stated that the original offer was a lac less than Tarachund states was sanctioned by His Highness himself, in the chits issued bearing his own signature. The letter is as follows :— No. 2421. Y our H ighness, 19^ October 1873. On the morning of the 7th instant, Nana Saheb Khanveekur , (the Minister) brought to my notice the claim which the firm of Dowlutchund Jowairchund, Jewellers of Ahmedabad, have against your Highness, for jewelry purchased from them on the occasion of your Highness' marriage about three years j ago. He stated that the amount originally offered for those jewels was only Rs. 1,71,000, but that Dowlutchund demands from your Highness the sum of Rs. 2,71,000 as the origHf price fixed on the jewels purchased at the time of ^ j marriage were said to have been of the value of twenty j63 /er SCHEDULE No. III.— No. Names of Claimants, &amp;c.

Nana Saheb concluded by saying that he mentioned these circumstances to me as he suspected that a complaint would be made to me on behalf of Jeweller, Dowlutchund, of Ahme- dabad, though he believed that the jewels in question really belonged to Amirchund Manickchund of Baroda, who is father-in-law of Manickchund. On the day succeeding the above interview, one Tarachund Wukkutchund, the nephew of Dowlutchund Jowairchund, of Ahmedabad, appeared in Court and made a statement on solemn affirmation^ copy of which is also attached. Next day, Muggun Mokum appeared in Court, and made the statement in solemn affirmation, which is also attached. In the first place, if it is true that your Highness signed the orders for the complete sum of Rs. 2,71,000, as alleged by Tarachund, and that Wussuntram Bhow actually realised the money, and carried it to account in the Government Bank under his charge, there can be no doubt whatever as to the amount which was originally fixed, as the value of the jewels, and consequently your Highness is in honour bound to pay that amount with interest. The collateral evidence of the letters addressed to your Highness by Dowlutchund also supports the truth of this (Tarachund's) statement. Hurriba Gaekwar Sitaram, Bhaichund Wurdhwan, and Wussun- tram Bhow are all perfectly well aware of the circumstances of the case; and moreover, the evidence of the accounts in the Furnees Department, the Jamdar Khana, and the State Bank under Wussuntram Bhow's superintendence, should be taken in settling this case, which I trust may receive your Highness 7 early consideration and settlement.

Statement of Tarachund Wakkutchund of the firm of Dowlut- chuiid Jowairchund, Jewellers of Ahmedabad, aged 23 years, occupation Jeweller, resides at Ahmedabad, on solemn affirma tion. Baroda, 8th October 1878. I have come to Baroda on behalf of my uncle, Dowlutchund Jowairachund's affairs. About fifteen days ago I brought from my uncle the two letters now produced in Court; one addressed to His Highness the Maharajah, dated 22nd of last month, and the other to the address of the Dewan Nana Saheb Khanwilkur. I delivered the originals to the above persons and these are copies. The facts of the case are as follows — In the beginning of 1871 my uncle received information from Amichund Manikchund, the father-in-law of Dowlutchund, that His Highness the Gaekwar required to purchase some jewellery for his approching marriage .My uncle sent me with the following articles:— One frontlet for the forehead, of diamonds and pearls. One necklace of diamonds and pearls, rubies and emeralds. One pair of wristlets of diamonds. One pair of earrings of diamonds. One ornament for turban of diamonds.64 SCHEDULE No. j &amp;C. General circumstances of eacH case. Rs. 2,71,799. mess' Jamdar Kbana. Bank. I brought a great many other articles of jewelry, but the above were approved. Soon after my arrival, Amichund's son, Futte^ chund, accompanied me to the palace, where we received orders to go to the Nuggur Paga, where the Ranee Saheb was at that time. We then gave the jewellery specified to Seetaram, the Karkoon of the Mahrajah s Jamdar Khana, for the purpose of being valued, approved, &amp;c. Seetaram entered the articles thus obtained in a book, and Futtechund and I return ed home. During about a month I kept going to Seetaram to ask him if the jewels were purchased. At last Futtechund and I and plenty of others jewellers were called to the Havelee to the Mahrajah; Hurriba Gaekwar, Bulwantrao Deo, Bulwantrao Yeshwunt, &amp;c., were there. We received orders to go the Jamdar Khana, and Hurriba Gaekwar and the other jewellers went with us. There the whole of the jewellery was shown. I stated the value of my jewellery to be about S'or 3J lacs. On this Hurriba Gaekwar and Seetaram showed my jewelry to the other jewellers, and they estimated the value at about lacs to 2,60,000. After this Bhaichund Wudman was called in by Hurriba Gaekwar, and after consulting him offered Rs. 2,71,799-8-6. I then urged for Rs. 4 or 5,000 in addition, but they refused. Then the jewellers and others there advised me to take this amount. I accordingly told Seetaram and Huriba Gaekwar that I accepted it. They then credited the above amount to my name in the accounts of the J amdar Khana, and told me to go home and that they would inform the Maharajah, and obtain the Furnees chit for payment and the signature of the Maharajah. A few days after the chits were made out and signed by the Maharajah and I produce copies of them. One is on Ma- niklal Kooslal of Ahmedabad (having a shop at Baroda), for Rs. 25,000: one on Chotilal Maniklal of Sinnur, who has a shop at Baroda, for Rs. 2,00,804-10-6 ; another on Gopalrao Myral ; for Rs. 45,994-14-0. This was after the marriage, and at this time three months had passed. I went to Seetaram* to ask for my chits. Seetaram told me to go to Wussuntram Bhowf as he was in authority. I did so, and Wussuntram Bhow told me that I could not receive the full amount demanded but that I must take something less. I said either give me back my jewels or pay me the full amount, as I could not take less than the amount settled, such not being the custom, and that I could not argue the point with the Sirkar. Wussuntram Bhow told me that the jewels had been worn at the Ranee s marriage at a propitious time, and that it was not possible to return them, neither could the amount fixed be given for them. I was then advised not to have any further altercation ^witn Wussantram Bhow about the matter, and I returned to Ahmedabad. I have received information that Wussuntram Bhow cashed His Highness' orders and placed the money m the Government Bank under his superintendence, and the money has been carrying interest since that time. Aboutfouror five months after this, my uncle wrote to the Maharajah on t e subject, but no reply was received. He after this wrote once or twice again. At last he sent a registered letter, as per receip attached, dated the 16th of September 1872. I produce a copy of this letter. No reply was received to this letter, and my uncle again addressed a registered letter to His Highi^ &amp;s in March 1873. I produce the register receipt and a cop} 0 the letter addressed to His Highness. We waited for three months, but having received no reply, my uncle addressed a t i r registered letter to His Highness on 1st July 1873, as per receip^ attached of that date. No reply was received to that a1is ^'i e came here by my uncle's order on 22nd December 1873, anat65 SCHEDULE No. III.— General circumstances of each &gt; next day went 'with a letter addressed to the Dewan's house and made it over to him, when he said that I should go to the palace the same day. I went accordingly and saw the Maharajah, in Durbar, where the following persons were also present— Dewan Saheb Khanvilkur, Huriba Gaekwar, Govindrow Mama, Bapoobhai Dayashunkur, Bulwuntrow Deo, Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt, and several others. I made over to the Maharajah my uncle's letter to His Highness' address, and placed Rs. 2 at His Highness 5 feet as a nuzzer. The Maharajah asked me whence I came, and I replied that I came from Ahmedabad, having been sent by my uncle to receive certain m oney due by His Highness. Bulwuntrow Deo then opened the letter and read it to the Maharajah, who desired me to go to the Dewan. The same evening I went to the Dewan at his house, who told me to go to him again the next morning, as he had not obtained His Highness' instructions on the subject. Muggun Mokum was with me at the time. I went to the Dewan's house the next morning, when he told me to meet him at the palace. I did so, and solicited that the matter might be soon disposed of as I was put to much inconvenience. The Dewan then desired me to go to his house in the evening, I went accordingly, accompanied by Muggun Mokum, the man above referred to. The Dewan told me that if we had con fidence in him that we should agree to receive any sum that he might fix, and suggested that I should proceed to Ahmedabad, and obtain my uncle's consent to refer the matter to the Dewan's arbitrament. I replied that my uncle wanted the full price fixed upon with interest, and that it was useless my going to Ahmedabad. The Dewan then took Muggun Mokum into a room, I remaining outside. The interview lasted for about 10 or 12 minutes and Muggun came out, and we took our leave. On the road Muggun told me that the matter might be compromised for 2| lacs of rupees, and that I should consult my uncle. I told him that I did not think that my uncle would accept anything less than the full price with interest. About this time I requested Wassant- ram Bhow while he was at the palace to be so kind as to settle this matter, when he said that I was fortunate that the matter was being considered ; that I deserved to be im prisoned because I did not come to terms. I replied that I was a British subject, and that my Government would look after me. I left Baroda for Ahmedabad three days after the Dussera, i.e., on 28th September 1873, and related all that had passed to my uncle, who said that he could not accept anything less than the full price and desired me to complain to the Resident. I arrived here yesterday and saw Muggun, to whom I had notified previously by letter that my uncle was not prepared to accept the settlement offered. Muggun told me that he had been to the palace, and mentioned this to Nana Saheb, who, he said, inquired of Shitaram and Gunputrow Athvahya whether we ever asked for the ornaments to be returned to us, and learnt that we had done so, but as the ornaments had been used on the occasion of the marriage, the Maharajah did not like to return them. The above having been explained to Tarachund Vakatchund, is admitted by him to be correct. (Signed) R. PHAYKE, Baroda, 8th day of October 1873.

I have dealings in Baroda, as I was supplying provisions to His Highness the Gaekwar a few years ago. I came to Baroda about twenty rlays ago to settle some accounts. About a fortnight ago, i e on 23rd September 1873, Tarachund, nephew of Dowlut- chund a ieweller of Ahmedabad, met me m Baroda and asked, me to 'accompany him to the house of the Dewan, as he was not well acquainted with the custom of Baroda. I consented, and we went to the Dewan Nana Saheb's house m the evening. Tarachund delivered to Nana Saheb a letter from his uncle Dowlutchund, and requested that the amount due to the latter for iewels sold to His Highness the Maharajah might be paid. Tarachund was desired by Nana Saheb to go to the palace the next day with the letter he had brought from his uncle Dowlutchund to the address of His Highness the Maharajah, The next day I accompanied Tarachund to the palace. Tara- chund went to the Maharajah; I remained outside. Tarachund returned shortly and told me that he had been ordered by the Maharajah to go to the Dewan. The same evening I and Tarachund went to the Dewan's house. The Dewan desired Tarachund to meet him the next day at the palace. We did so, but the Dewan said that we should go to his house the next day. We went accordingly, when the Dewan desired Tarachund to obtain authority from his uncle to accept any settlement that he, the Dewan, should propose. Tarachund replied that his uncle would not accept any thing less than the full price with interest, and that it was useless his going to Ahmedabad to obtain the authority suggested. I was then taken by the Dewan into a room and was told that he would have the matter compromise or 21 lacs, and that I should suggest to Tarachund to g 0 . 0 Ahmedabad and induce his uncle to accept the compromise. We then left the Dewan's house, and on the road I iniorme Tarachund of what the Dewan had told me. larachuii then left for Ahmedabad. Four or fiye days subsequently, Tarachund sent a man to me with a letter stating that his unc e would not take anything less than the full price with ' and that he would not agree to the compromise proposed. ^ same day I went to the Dewan's house with the man wno a brought Tarachund's letter and told him what Tarachund a written. The Dewan replied that he would speak to ® Maharaja and let me know. Two or three days ^ I went to the Jamdarkana for some private business. j Dewan was then there, and on seeing me^ he sent for Gunpu rao Athwalya and asked him to relate the circumstances un e which the price of Dowlutchund's jewels had remained iinp al • ^ Gunputrao said that Dowlutchund wanted the price that ^ been fixed at the time of sale in Shitaram's time, subsequently Vassuntrao Bhow had the ornaments and that he wishes to pay the reduced price so fixed. ^ Dewan then asked me why Dowlutchund would not r ? c ^ ag the price fixed by Vussuntrao Bhow. I replied that i ^ usual for merchants to receive the price fixed at the tirn the bargain; that when Vussuntrao Bhow offered the re ^ ^ price_, Dowlutchund requested that his ornaments mig returned, but that they were not returned; when ^ un P. 1 !- oU&amp; replied that as the ornaments had been used on the P r0 PV ^ occasion of the marriage, the Maharaja refused to return ^ The Dewan then made me the following three proposals./ 67 / SCHEDULE No. Karnes of Claimants, &amp;c.

The Dewan also got these proposals recorded on paper which was made over to Gunputrao Athwalya. I told the Dewan that I would send for the Jeweller Dowlut- chund's nephew, Tarachund, by a telegram. The same day I sent a telegram accordingly. The next day Tarachund came to Baroda when I informed him of what the Dewan had proposed to me. He did not at all entertain any of the proposals and stated that he would complain to the Eesident. This is all I know in the case.

Translation of Durbar Yad, No. 2596, dated the 5th December 1873. I have received the Residency Yad, No. 2421, dated the 11th October 1873, with regard to the jewels purchased from Jeweller Dowjutchund of Ahmedabad on the occasion of my marriage; with regard to it I have to state as follows:— On the occasion of my marriage a quantity of jewels was pur chased, and on that occasion ornaments were purchased from Jeweller Dowlutchund. Dowlutchund demands that he may be given the sum at which the ornaments were then valued, and which was taken in his name from the Government shop. But the ornaments did not properly come up to the value stated, and when I understood that they were of less value, I said that the value should be truly fixed again; and on so making the valuation, Dowlutchund's ornaments are found to be of less value, in the same way as the ornaments of other jewellers. The other jewellers received the amount accord ingly, but Dowlutchund did not. If he was not willing to receive the truly fixed price, he should have taken back his ornaments. The person who has made statement on his behalf in the Residency states that although request was made for the ornaments to be returned, the reply made was that as they had been used on an auspicious occasion, they would not be returned, but if he received a reply out and out he ought to have made a representation to us and we would have caused the ornaments to be returned.

A memo, shuwing the ornaments so purchased was made over by the Kamdar of the Jewellery Department to the Fudna- vish, in order that chits for their value might be prepared. Chits were prepared accordingly, the amount of which I was to receive from the Parukhs.

Dated 5th December 1873. In this case the British firm at Ahmedabad trades at Baroda through the Baroda firm of Bhaichund Wurdhman, f m whom a receipt for the full value of the jewels was taken by the Gaekwar Government; but to whom about 5 lacs and 28,000 rupees were short-paid. A copy of this receipt is produced, signed on behalf of the British firm.

We trade at Baroda under the name of Mugunlal Hukkumchund through Bhaichund Wurdhman, also Oomadi-1 chund Hulteesing and Gopalrao Myral. Shortly before the time of H. H. Mulharrao's marriage, 1871, we ; received intelligence that a large number of jewels were required. Shetaram, the Jamdar Kamdar of H. II. the Gaekwar, applied to Bhaichund to procure some, but as Bhaichund's house had only recently been released from attachment, he was not in a position to meet a large order. He therefore sent word to me and others to supply some. I came to Baroda with some ornaments—some I procured from Bombay. I also redeemed Rs. 65,000 worth of jewels, which my firm had mortgaged to Gopalrao Myral; altogether I collected about 17 lacs of rupees' worth, of which about 12 lacs worth were selected by H. H. Mulharrao himself for pur chase, and orders were given to the Government Kamdar, Shetaram, accordingly. The price was fixed by Shetaram in the presence of several jewellers at Rs. 11,91,047-15-3. Hurriba and two or tkree other Kamdars were present at the time. In addition to the above, Rs. 595 worth of bracelets were kept, on the condition that if reqaired they would be included and paid for. These ornaments have not been return ed, and they agree to pay the price but with regard to the larger amount, I left for Ahmedabad and requested Shetaram to pay the amount to Gopalrao Myral, through whom we had j sold the ornaments to the Maharajah, and I also requested that Bhaichund's receipt might be accepted for the amount on wj behalf. For this business we contracted a debt with Gopa- rao Myral of R^. 1,89,834-12-0, and we re quested Gopata 0 Myral to take this amount and pay the balance over to Bhai I chund Wuradhman on our account. Bhaichund was als ( )1 quested to remit the balance to us at Ahmedabad. The chi s l were prepared and signed by the Maharajah. They were on io urteen different banks.

Eight days subsequently Wussuntram Bhow had Rs. 6,62,259-4-6 paid to Gopalrao Myral on our account m part-payment, and said to Bhaichund Wuradhman that he would have the balance paid up afterwards. On the same date Gopalrow Myral paid Rs. 4,72,424-8-6 to Bhaichund Wuradhman, the balance of Rs. 1,89,834-12-0 being kept by Gopalrow in liquidation of the debt due by us to him. Bhai chund wrote to us and informed us of the above i we wrote to him in reply that the whole of the amount due by the Gaekwar may be obtained and remitted to us. Bhaichund wrote back to say that he demanded the balance from Wussuntram Bhow; but that the latter refused to pay , Wa requested Bhaichund to get the balance, but he has not as yet done so. The amount of Rs. 4,72,424-8-6 is still in deposit with him. We made no application to the Maharajah or to any other authority, as such ^ course would enrage the Durbar against Bhaichund, who is my father s fathcr-in-law, and he might be deceived. I now pray that the balance with interest may be ordered to be paid by the Gaekwar Government. (Signed) MOHUNLALL MUGGONBHOY.

It was a Baroda subject, Bhaichund Jowere, who in this instance signed for the Ahmedabad firm, a subject who owing to exten sive monetary transactions with the Gaekwar State, is alleged to be entirely under their power. It will be also observed that all these transactions occurred at the very outset of the present Gaekwars reign, and consequently the mercantile and other classes who have suffered so deeply at His Highness Malharrao s hands, were not aware of the risk they run in making over property of immense value to the persons named in these proceedings ; hence is submitted the necessity for protecting our mercantile interests in such extraordinary 18 G R70 SCHEDULE No. Jll.—contmued.

He has been a British subject since Septem ber 1869^ a certificate to which effect he holds from the Senior Magistrate of Police^ Bombay. Amthabhai and his partner Goverdhun are also partners in the Bombay firm of Chimanbhai Maniklal, in which house Bul- wuntrao Roholkur some time ago deposited Rs. 70,001, at interest, a receipt for which amount had been duly passed to him by the firm. Early in the present year^ His Highness Maharajah Mulharrao demanded the surrender of this amount by this firm, in reply to which the petitioners promised to pay the said Rs. 70,000 if a receipt for the same were furnished to them from Roholkur himself. In consequence of their having made this reason able request^ their shop and house were at once seized, their business stopped, and Govurdhun's family was at first turned out of the house^ but was afterwards allowed the use of one room. Petitioners were themselves absent in Bombay but their Goomastas were imprisoned. On this case being reported to the present Resident about April this year^ the Minister was moved to obtain the receipt by the firm to Rohulkur, which was done ; upon which the Bombay firm immediately paid the Rs, 70,000 to the Baroda State, which it is submitted they could not have done in the manner arbitrarily demanded by the Gaekwar without running the risk of having to pay the amount a second time to Rohulkur himself had he been allowed to retain the original receipt. Petitioners therefore submit that as they committed no fault whatever in this matter, they are entitled to compensation from the Gaekwar Government for the unjust stoppage of their business, &amp;c., as described above, the damage sustained being estimated by them at Rs. 13,300. of I The case of the old established iirm Huree Bhugtee, No. 37, of Schedule II., is submitted as affording evidence of the insecurity of bankers at Baroda under the present administration. ;t is submitted that the same arguments used with regard to the previous three cases of this schedule, setting forth the necessity that exists under the present system of administration for protecting the interests of British subjects^ banking and trading with Baroda, are applicable to the cases of Amthabhai Runchode and his partner Govurdh an, herein .described. Under a proper system of Government, no such extraordinary mea sures would be requisite; indeed, as a rule, native princes are most particular in protecting the commercial and banking interests within their respective spheres of power, and there fore the case of Baroda is exceptional and attributable to the alleged anarchy that now prevails. Jase of Balwuntrao Gunesh, Mahadeorao The services rendered to the Gaekwar State by the late Dewan Gunesh, Rumchunder Gunesh^ the sons Gunesh Sudashiv were of the most distinguished character for a number of years extending from the time of Syajeerao to of Gunesh Sudashiv, late Minister of the Gaekwar State, from the time of Maha rajah Syajeerao to 1861. Sumvut 1918 (1861), ft72 SCHEDULE No. General circumstances of each case. In acknowledgment thereof a sunud was granted to Mm i n the year 1915 (A. D. (1858) in which His Highness Khunderao stated that in consequence of the Dewan's good services generally during his tenure of office, more especially in the year of the mutinies (1857)_ when he was mainly instrumen tal in obtaining the remission of a permanent expenditure of 8 lacs of rupees per annum, which the Gaekwar State was bound by Treaty to pay for the maintenance of the Gujrat Horse at Ahmedabad. It is moreover recorded in the same sunud to the honour and credit of the said Minister, that in consequence of the indebt edness of the Gaekwar State, he declined to accept the salary of Rs. 60,000 per annum due to him. Accordingly in Sumvut 1915 (A. D. 1858) an inam village named Dawut, whose annual value at that time was Rs. 10,000, was ordered by His Highness Khunderao to be given to him, his heirs, and successors for ever; and it was specified in the sunud that whether the revenue thereof-fall or increase, the fluctua tions shall be yours, and you and your posterity shall enjoy of the village uninterruptedly. A reference having been made to the Government of India to guarantee these proceedings of His Highness the Gaekwar, owing to the nature of the services rendered by GuneshSudashiv, Earl Canning wrote in reply to His Highness Khunderao on the 6th February 1860, ' that to do so would show that there was a doubt of your sincerity; and I trust fully that when the Gaekwar Government makes a grant of its own free will a guarantee for its continuance, ness has ever given cannot h This decision of the Right Hon'ble the Governor General was communicated to Gunesh Sudashiv by the Resident Sir R. Shakespear in a highly complimentary letter, dated 1st May 1860, No. 382, to the address of the Durbar. Thus every possible means was adopted to secure the inam in question to Gunesh Sudashiv and his posterity, whether the revenue fell or increased. There is a clause in the sunud above referred to, which, refer ring to the grant of the inam says, ' lest any one be jealous of you by reason of the above engagement, we have given you the pledge of the British Resident for the continuance of the inam on the above terms.' Not long after the receipt of Earl Canning's letter, symptoms of the jealousy just referred to manifested themselves ; rumours and hints of bribery, &amp;c., came into circulation, and the result was not the confiscation of the recently-granted jagheer, or an open announcement on the part of the Gaekwar of his belief in the accusations brought against Gunesh Sudashiv, but the exaction of a nuzerana of ,3 lacs of rupees from the maligned Minister and his retirement from office. Thus the faults of the Minister, if any, were condemned by the payment of this nuzerana. \73 SCHEDULE No. III.— / f! ^8 Names of Claimants, &amp;c.

Within five years from this time, viz., 1922, the old man died, and his sons succeeded to the estate, bat at the beginning of 1924 (1867-68), their right to it was called in question by His Highness Khunderao, on the ground that the grantee Gunesh Sudashiv, had taken advantage of his position as Dewan to have a village named in the sunud as worth only Es. 10,000, when in reality it was worth Rs. 24^000; and con sequently that all revenue in excess of the former amount would lapse to the Gaekwar State. The sons appealed to the Resident (Colonel Barr) who pointed out to His Highness Khunderao that he had himself granted the estate in perpetuity, and had especially provided for the probability of its increase in value ; and consequently that as anticipated the combined effects of the introduction of the railway, nine years' good management and outlay on the pro perty, and the introduction of a higher rate of assessment than previously^ had more than doubled the value of the jagheer. With reference moreover to the assertion of the Durbar that Gunesh Sudashiv had taken advantage of his position to select a village worth more than the Rs. 10,000 mentioned in the sunud^ the evidence of the village accounts was ap pealed to, as proving that there was no foundation whatever for this assertion. On the contrary that the increase in value that had taken place was fairly attributable to the causes already stated above. Extract of the accounts is given in the margin from 1893 to 1914, the year preceding the grant of the village in inam to Gunesh Sudashiv. It appears from this document that for the first 17 years during which the village was under the Kumavisdars, the average receipts were Rs. 6,969 per annum. During the next four years it was given in inam to the Gaekwar s relative, Dada Saheb, at the rate of Rs. 9,500 per annum. In the year 1914 (that preceding the grant), the village was farmed out, and under that system Rs. 12,750 was paid for it. The average receipts of the 7 years preceding the grant were Rs. 10,134. During the four years 1906 to 9, when Bhow Tambekur was Minister and Gunesh Sudashiv had nothing to do with the village/the average receipts were Rs. 8,040 per annum. Unless therefore these accounts are false, and should such be asserted, the originals should be produced; it appears clear that at the time of making the grant, the bona fide value of the village was Rs. 10,000 as named in the sunnud; and consequently that there are no grounds whatever for confiscat ing the village for the reasons set forth by the Durbar. This charge was not put forth when the three lacs of rupees were demanded on account of alleged bribes taken by the Minister. It is an after-thought adopted, apparently with the direct intention of breaking the solemn promise made in the sunud confirmed by the Resident, and alluded to in such strong terms in His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General's lettter of the 6th February 1860, above quoted. 4. 19 G J74 I SCHEDULE No. III.— Chiter on Mahal, Purgunna Baroda. The village of Dawnt being a jagheer given to the late Gunesh Sudashiv, but under attachment since 1924, having been by an order of the Sir Sooba, No. 1072, dated MaghSudh 12,Sumvut 1927 restored the revenues thereof as realized for the year 1927, should be refunded to Bulvuntrao Madhowrao and Ram- Chundra, Gunesh as follows :— It would appear from the Annual Administration Report of the year 1871, that the Resident, Colonel Barr, had settled this case with the present Gaekwar in favour of the sons of Guuesh Sudasiv, it being stated in the 24th paragraph as follows:- He (His Highness Mulharrao) has also restored to the sons of Gunesh Sudasiv the village of Dawut, conferred upon that Ministerfor eminent services during the Indian Mutiny * * This village of Dawut was resumed by the late Gaekwar on the pretext that it was very much more valuable than shown in the deed of grant * * * But the Gaekwar Khunderao was reminded that in the sunud, although a value was named for the village, it was also declared to have been conferred for ever, be the income derived from it more or less.' Paragraph 28. ' The sons of Gunesh Sudashiv however had no influence at Court, and so the late Gaekwar (Khunderao] could not be induced to continue the village to them. It is very creditable to the present Gaekwar that he has acted thus fairly towards the family, and the more so, because he had nothing to do with the original grant to their father.' This was ratified by the official order quoted in the margin. Arrears on account of out standing balances at close of 1926 ^ Pay in cash ... Total Rs. Rs. a. 497 10 5,791 2 9 6288 13 o Case of Sukha Wahala, of Nuldra, in Nowsari. The jagheer had been under sequestration for three years, viz., from 1924 to 1926, both inclusive. The income for those three years amounted to Rs. 73,200-15-0^ out of which amount His Highness Mulharrao exacted a nuzerana of Rs. 43,200-15-0, and gave the balance of Rs. 30,000 at Rs. 10,000 per annum to the Jagheerdars. From this it appears that His Highness Mulharrao's restora tion of the rights of the Jagheerdars has not been so complete as Colonel Barr believed His Highness had promised. It is true that the village was restored and the portion of the revenues for 1927 that had been realized by the Durbar refunded, in apparent performance of the promise made to Colonel Barr, and in just recognition of the provisions of the sunud, but at the beginning of the present year, about the time of Colonel Barr's death, the petitioners were alarmed by the jagheer being again sequestrated; and their prayer now is that the bond fide promises of their holding the village in perpetuity, as set forth in the sunud, may be secured to them, and the village be again made over to their charge. The father of the petitioners, Gunesh Sudashiv, received a village in inam from the British Government (which the petitioners still enjoy) on account of the distinguished and valuable services which he performed for the British Government as well as for his own State during the mutinies. The facts of the case will sufficiently appear from the follow ing statement made by Sukha Wahala, and the yad address ed by the Resident to the Durbar, No. 2395, dated 7th October 1873 : Sooka Walla Chowdree, of Nuldra, in Nowsari, follows :— states I hold an eight-anna share in the village of Nuldra of the value of about Rs. 7,000 per annum. In Sumvut 1922, I and some75 ^3 SCHEDULE No. III.— General circumstances of each case. other shareholders in the village borrowed the sum of ; Rs. 10,000 from Dwarkadass Lulloobhai, the Manager of the firm of Warusdass Wittnldass, in Surat, and a bond was exe cuted, I have no copy of that bond; the money was borrowed to clear off old debts and to meet the expenses of a dispute that was going on between the sharers and one Jugga Amra. One Kooverjee Doolub was at that time farmer of the Mahals of XJntapur and Bissunpur, in Nowsari, and the aforesaid Dwarkadass was the security of Kooverjee whose farm was for nine years certain from 1922; and the terms were that if the management were taken out of Koo verjee s hands before the expiration of the above period, he was to be reimbursed for bis loss. In 1923 the manage ment was taken away from him, and not only was he not reimbursed for his losses, but it was stated that about Rs. 84,000 was due by him to the Gaekwar Government for arrears of revenue. Kooverjee's security, Dwarkadass, being in Surat, they could not touch him, so the Sooba, Narayen Rugonath, came upon me and desired me to pay to him, what I and my fellow-sharers owed to Dwarkadass. I said that I had passed a bond to Dwarkadass, and that if he came with the bond, we would pay the amount to him. Upon this Narayen Ragonath attached the whole village which was under my management: this was in Sumvut 1924. I went to Narayen Rugonath and represented the injustice of the case. Moreover, at that time Kooverjee Doolub was in prison on this same account. Narayen Rugonath said that he would raise the attachment, if I stood security for the payment of any sum that may on inquiry be found due by Kooveijee. 1 refused to stand security Rugonath threatened to imprison In this helpless condi tion I signed the security bond ; Koveerjee was thereupon released and attachment raised from the village. No inquiry was then made as to the arrears alleged to be due by Koover jee. Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt became Sooba at the end of Sumvut 1924 and continued there till Sumvut 1925. Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt caused no annoyance to myself or to Kooverjee. But the Sk Sooba of the Mahals, Hurriha Gaekwar, sent for Kooveijee to Baroda, and imprisoned him for the alleged arrears of revenue in Kartig, Sumvut 1925. He remained in confinement for three years, and was then releas ed on bail. Up to that time no demand of any kind was made on him by any of the Soobas who succeeded Narayen Rugo nath, viz., Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt, Goolam Kadur Moonshee and Gopal Myral. In Sumvut 1928, Sevajeerow Khunvelker alias Nana Shib, became Sooba of Nowsari, and sent Narayen Rugonath as his Deputy; and as the ktter had feel ings of enmity against me, he revived the old question of my security for Kooverjee and attached my house and crops; this was in October last year. Within the last few months this Narayen Ragonath has himself became Sooba, though the real power as such remains in the Minister's hands. The cause of Narayen Ragonath's enmity against me as is follows:— In Bhow Scindia's time (1925) Kooverjee made a complaint to the Gaekwar Government 'that Narayen Ragonath had taken bribes, and amongst others one of Rs. 8,000 from me ; this was proved by the account books, and he was removed I from Nowsari to Puttun. The other reason why Narayen j Rugonath has now gone against me, and attached my pro perty is, that our opponent, Jugga, moved Narayen Rago nath to revive the question of my security and thus ruin j me. This he himself gave out. The crops were sold by76 SCHEDULE No. No. Names of Claimants, &amp;c. auction last March^ and I have been prev ented from cultivate ing my land this year also: the conseque nee is that I and my family are starving; I have never been credited with the proceeds of the former attachment or this. Last yoar my house was attached and valued, but I was allowed to livg it, but last month Narayen Rugonath has attached my cattle and all my moveable property, such as grain, &amp;c. I am reduced to extreme poverty. I have represented this fre quently to the Durbar, Wirisht Court, and Sir Sooba, but without obtaining justice. Y ad No. 2895. Y our H ighness, —I have twice written regarding the case of the Parsee Bapoojee Cursetjee, &amp;c. and on the last occasion I sent a prima, facie case to you making certain demands in the name of public justice. I now write once more and request an answer within 24 hours; in default of which I should refer the matter to Government for their orders. There is ample evidence to show that, independently of the case of Bapoojee Cursetjee, which is bad enough, Narayen Ragonath is not a fit man to be entrusted with any authority whatever. His conduct in Puttun, as already represented to you in any Yad No. dated ultimo, and again his con duct in the case which I herewith forward for your considera tion, affords sufficient proof as to what kind of man he is.

You should not give stones for any other purpose without our permission. In case you fail to supply stones within the prescribed period, and the survey operations be thereby obstructed, you will be held responsible for the same.

Bhanabhai received orders to bring 40,000 such stones as described in the contract up the Nowsari creek, about 2 miles above the town, which he did in boats hired for the purpose; but during the year 1864 only about 4,500 were taken, upon which he went to the Durbar to complain and ask for the Rs. 20,000 due to him upon the whole number according to agreement. The Revenue Sir Sooba, Hurriba Gaekwar, replied to the peti tioner Bhanabhai's appeal in the following letter No. 557, dated Karteek Wud 8th, 1921 (November 1864), addressed to the Sir Sooba of Nowsari (or Surat Attavesi):— Last year when the survey operation was introduced into the districts under your control, Desai Bhanabhai Lallbhai, of Bulsar, had entered into an agreement to supply stones for boundary marks being fixed ; but as there was no occasion at that time to take stones from him, the Dessai preferred a claim for damages or compensation, which claim was rejectedby the Sirkar after inquiry. The survey operations having been recommenced in the Province of Nowsari this year, you are requested to take stones which may be required for boundary marks from Bhanabhai. It rests with the ryots to make boun dary mounds either of earth or stones; the ryots should therefore be informed that they should take any stones they may require from the aforesaid Desai, and the value of such stones should be recovered hy us from the ryots and paid to the contractor at the rate formerly agreed upon The stones should not be taken from any other person, and the necessary instructions on the subject should be issued to the officers in districts. The value of the stones taken from the Desai 20 G K78 SCHEDULE No. III.—continued. last year should also be recovered and paid to him (the cou.| tractor) as well. (Signed) HUREIBA GAEKWAR, Revenue Sir Sooba. : Upon the receipt of these orders Bhanabhai returned to Now- sari, and was ordered by the Sir Sooba, Gopalrow Myral, to proceed with the work of providing boundary stories for each purgunna of the Nowsari Zilla ; and he states that within about 6 months, ending about May 1865, he provided the following numbers of stones in the purgunn specified, viz.:— Already provided. 40,000 For Murrowti.. .60,000 Tailari 80,400 Gundavri 40,000 I For Timba 40,000 | For Kamraj 36,000 Wusraii and Gurra.1,30,000 | Total 5,31,400. Value Bs. 2,65,700 For Mhowa 40,000 For Nowsari 6*000 Bullasu 50,000 The complainant. Bhanabhai explains that in addition to the 40,000 stones referred to as having been brought by him to Nowsari, he had on hand about 1| lacs in addition in the Pardi, Dungri, and Parnera quarries, near Balsar, which he brought into use. In addition to working these quarries he at once opened new ones at the following places in British territory, Surat Zilla: Turban, Surbain, Bardoli, Bagejea; and also at the following places in Gaekwar territory^ Dunori^ Narodia, and Vusravi. He states that he executed the work with the Deccan establish ments which he had when doing the contract work of the British Government; but that he got some additional Wuddars from the Deccan for the work under reference. He produces an agreement which he made with these Wuddars (Bildars.) Complainant explains that Sir Sooba Gopalrow Myral left the Nowsari Mahal about February 1865 after he had been going on the second time for three or four months. His successor was Gunesh Rughoonath, and being apprehensive that some altera tion in Gopalrow Myral's arrangements might take place, he accompanied by the Bildars waited upon Gunesh Rughoonath at Visona, in Nowsari, and requested him to pay what was due for stones already delivered to the ryots (w T ho had been taking away the stones as they were required); and that in future cash payments should be made when the stones were removed. At this time the work was stopped in consequence of the unsettled state of things. Gunesh Rughoonath said that under the terms of the contract Bhanabhai could not claim payment before the completion of the work, and that he would be held responsible for any cessation of work that might take place so as to affect the survey operations. At the same time Gunesh Rughoonath issued the following order direct to the muccadums of Bildars in the service of Bhanabhai:— The contractor has made it a rule to issue stones on cash pay- Mhawud 3rd, 1921. ^ the but this course will February, 1885.

If this statement be true, and I have not the least doubt of its being* so, owing to the evidence of a similar kind that has been recorded^ the onus of not fulfilling the agreement in 1863 lies with the Gaekwar Government, that act has been the sole cause of the complainants ruin. A highly respectable man has been de prived of his Wuttun, and in short com plete ruin and desolation have been brought upon him under the circum stances related.

After this the work went on as before and by June 1865 it was completed, as above stated, when payment was demanded from Gunesh Rughoonath. No particular amount was mention ed at that time; all that the contractor asked was settlement of account, which,would at that time have been easy throuo-h the medium of the contractor's own accounts of what had been given to the ryots and the accounts of the survey. Gunesh Rughoonath took the contractor to Baroda, and the latter waited upon him daily for about a week, soliciting him to compare his accounts with the survey maps and records, but he did not do so. At last Gunesh Rughoonath and Narayeu- bhai and Bulwantrow Deo proposed to the contractor to sign a receipt in full of all demands by way of commencing the settlement solicited. Bhanabhai replied that as yet he had not received a single pie nor had his accounts been made up and how could he sign such a document. The three persons in question replied that this was his only plan of getting paid at all; that half his bill would be paid to him ; and that he must promise not to complain to the Maharajah about the other half. They added, you only understand the English system; this is the Gaekwaree way of doing business. Some friends told him that do what he might a receipt would be extorted from him, so fearing such a result he fled at once to Camp, and afterwards went to Surat and complained to Mr. Cameron, the Judge and Agent. Mr. Cameron took the matter up in August 1865, and wrote to the Resident, Colonel Barr, requesting that Bhanabhai's claims might receive notice from him. The only action taken at the time by the Gaekwar was as follows :—Bhana bhai held a Oessaigiree wuttun in the Tailari Bur^unoa of the Nowsari Zillah, the emoluments of which consisted of Rs. 2,400 in cash, an inam village, and lands. Bhanabhai resided at Bulsar, in British territory, and had a Deputy on the Tailari estate. About November 1865, within three months of Mr. Cameron's reference, the Deputy was turned out, and the Wuttun of the family attached including house, &amp;c. ' This was ancestral property, and had been in their possession for 100 years. The attachment still continues. Bhanabhai explains that other wuttuns had been attached with the general attachment, but that his had not been so. He there fore regards this act of the Gaekwar Government as dis tinctly connected with this reasonable appeal to the British authorities for redress regarding the boundary stones. No reply having been given by Colonel Barr to Mr. Cameron's- letter of August 1865 by the end of 1865, Mr. Hope, the Collector of Surat, took the matter up and requested Colonei Barr to expedite a reply to Mr. Cameron's reference.

No satisfaction having been obtained at Baroda, he petitioned His Excellency the Governor in August 1868, and in November of that year Mr. Hope thus wrote on the subject to the Resident, Colonel Barr: 'I have on several occasions conversed regarding Bhanabhai's case with both Major Prescott and Mr. Rogers, who were personally acquainted with it, anxl have not the slightest doubt of the truth of his claim, and of his having been corruptly defrauded of his just dues by the Gaekwar officials, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. ,, From that time to the present the whole matter has been sub ject of reference to and from Government. In their Resolu tion No. 9, dated 5th January 1870, the following resolution was issued para. 1 : ' The Resident should be informed that it would seem clear from the inquiries which have been made that the claim of the petitioner is not without some substan tial foundation. That he should consequently exert his influ ence to procure a satisfactory settlement, and remonstrate strongly if any further evasion is attempted on the part of the Durbar, the fact whether any stones were ordered and supplied should be ascertained from the Durbars' records, and the object of requiring the petitioner to go to Nowsari to point out the stones which he had given to the ryots is not apparent/' (A report on the whole case by Mr. Hope accom panies this Resolution.) In January of the present year the Government after further correspondence passed the following Resolution, No. 460, 23rd January 1873 :— ' The Acting Resident should be directed to bring petitioner's claim to the notice of His Highness the present Gaekwar, under whose consideration the subject his not yet apparently been brought, and to state that Government consider that it is undoubted that petitioner did supply stones to the ryots on the Durbar's account, and that he is entitled to proper remuneration, and that Government trust His Highness will order an equitable settlement to be made.' The petitioner's statement in the case is as follows:— I practice as a Vakeel in the Durbar Courts. My bother Fut- teram was Fouzdar of Puttun. He has recently been convicted of torturing certain people, and has been sentenced by the Baroda Foujdar to imprisonment. My brother Fut teram obtained the appointment of Foujdar of Puttun in April last. He had to expend Rs.. 7,000 to obtain this appointment, namely Rs. 4,000 as nuzerana to H. H. the Maharajah and the rest as a bribe to Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt and the Minister. I and my brother both paid the total sum of Rs. 7,000 in May last to Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt at his house. The latter was alone. I produce an original order of the Durbar signed by Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt, No. 498, dated Veishak Shud 7th, Sumvut 1929, being a receipt for Rs. 3,000 credited in His Highness' accounts as nuzerana. I also pro duce copy of similar receipt of the same date for Rs. 1,000 in the name of Jorabhai Huisrubjee, of Puttun, from whom we borrow^ ^ that sum.

General circumstances of each case. The petitioner's complaint appears from the following statement, made on solemn affirmation before the Resident:— In last January I gave Rs. 3,500 as nuzerana to His Highness the Gaekwar for the appointment of Foujdar of the Kurree Mahal for five years certain, and I gave Bulwuntrow Yesh- wunt, the Sir Foujdar, the sum of Rs. 2,000, that I should not be interfered with in my five years' appointment. I paid this Rs. 2,000 as follows : Rs. 1,600 in cash and Rs. 400 by a promissory note that I would pay the amount shortly. Until I gave this note to Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt he prevented my joining my appointment. Eventually I got orders to leave Baroda in May last. I went to Kurree and received charge, but I was not allowed to carry on work longer than last month, September, when I was ordered to be imprisoned and sent to Baroda, but having heard of this order I came here and asked Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt why I had been sent for. He replied that I had to be sent to the Sir Foujdar of the Northern District on business connected with my father. I represented that if I were taken away from my duties I should be ruined; that my father was alive and ready to answer for himself. Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt in the meantime appointed a relative of his own named Rughoonathrow Narrayen to act for me. My house in Kurree was attached, and all my property and my father's house in Puttun. Private papers were taken away, as also my mare worth Rs. 200. I received an honourable appointment from the Government, but have been ruined by the private enmity of Bulwuntrow Yeshwunt. I claim either that I shall be allowed to return to my appointment, or that my Rs. 8,500 and Rs. 1,600 may be returned to me, I borrowed this money through the security of a Sidhpur Bania named Hurgovind Nurseram who is now in Baroda, The petitioner's complaint appears from the following statement made on solemn affirmation before the Resident :— The Mahal of Kural was farmed out to me by the Minister Nana Saheb Kanvilkur for five years certain from Sumvut 1929. I agreed to pay Rs. 2,101 annually to the Sirkar, over and above the revenues realised for the year Sumvut 1928. I signed an agreement on June 29th 1872, a copy of which I produce. In consideration of Nana Saheb having given me the farm, I agreed to pay him as Sookree Rs. 2,000 annually on his private account, and a private agreement was made to the effect, dated 31st June 1872, copy of which is annexed. One or two days before this agreement I paid Nana Saheb Rs. 2,000 for the first year in advance. I borrowed this sum from Muggunlal. I took the money to Nana Saheb's house. There were present at the time Nana Saheb, Govindrow Luxemon, his Karkoon, Bulwantrow and Bhaskerpunt. Govindrow informed Nana Saheb that Rs. 2,000 for the Kural Mahal had come, and he ordered it to be received. A day or two after this, I received an order appointing me to the Kural Mahal, and I sent my Karkoon to receive charge and I went myself about four or five months afterwards, and stayed for 10 days or a fortnight. I did not reside there permanently but came backwards and forwards to Baroda. In February last a mohsul of Rs. 20 per diem was issued to make me pay Nana Saheb's private Sookree for the year Sumvut 1930 in advance. The mohsul remained three days, and was only withdrawn when on the fourth day I paid Rs. 1,000 worth of gold to the Minister Nana Saheb. In April last a Karkoon named Baboorow Krishna was sent to me by Nana Saheb with instructions that he was to manage the Mahal for me. I protested against of^ 21 G.

Compare preceding cases. this and said that I had the Mahal for five years certain^ and that if this was insisted on^ the Sookree I had paid should be returned to me. I often waited on Nana Saheb, but could not see him except once or twice, when I received an unsatisfactory reply. That Karkoon was never recalled The sum total of my claims against the Minister and Baroda Government are as follows :— Hs. Sookree paid to Nana Saheb 8 000 Interest on ditto Security expenses for two years 40() Compensation for loss of pay for unexpired portion of contract 4 qqq ^ , . Total 7 ,850 Deduct received from farmed villages of Sumra and Sumri 255 Balance due......Us. The particulars of this case are fully shown in the following Yad addressed to the Durbar No. 2463 of October 16tli, 1873. Y oue H ighness ,—In my Yad No. 2140 of 12th ultimo, I represented the case of Bulwuntrow Luximon, namely, that he had been deprived of a sayer contract of the villages of Jerode and Waghoria before the term of his contract had expired, and requested Your Highness to do him justice. In reply to this, your No. 2044 of September 28th with ac companiments was received, and it was stated therein that the reason for discontinuing the contract was that the former had not furnished the required security within the period fixed upon in the agreement, namely, June 24th, 1873, the contract itself having been sold to petitioner on May 27th, , f or ®' s, 1^600, and this sale having been confirmed on the 7th of June 1873. The petitioner signed a document agreeing to produce tho security by the evening of June 24th, A\ith a stipulation that if he did not do so the contract might i ' S T He did uot furnish the security until August 1st ^ hen ^ was duly accepted by the Wywutdar under orders fromthe Sir Sooba, Hurriba Gaekwar himself. More- ?' v ei '.' ai1 0 ™er was addressed to the petitioner, Bulwuntrow Luximon, dated August 2nd, and also to the Karkoon in charge ot the bayer Revenue duties that he should take charge. Moreover agreement was taken from him, dated July 21st, ,-i 0 .' c ° n , ririm S the contract on him for one year, and fixing the instalments which he was to pay. Thus the petitioner was installed into the office of the contractor by the ir 1 oo aimself; and the original agreement regarding the pro uc ion o security by June 24th was cancelled by subse quent proceedings on the part of the Durbar. The above is e pe i loner s case as proved by documents now in his possession copies of which are annexed. Notwithstanding the above statement of facts, the action taken by the oo a, urnba Gaekwar, is as follows:—He produces a i ' cute 23rd July, only two days subsequent to the • , .agreement made with the petitioner. This document ■, e ec that as the petitioner failed to provide secu- w Recording to the original agreement of June he had rfeited his right to the contract.

I have now seen many cases of this kind in which faith is not kept with Wywutdars and farmers of all kinds^ and that high officials appear to do great injustice by re-selling contracts as has been done in the present case. So long as this want of good faith continues there cannot be any proper conduct of busi ness throught the State, and as the bad con duct of the Sir Sooba, Hurriba Gaekwar, is clearly proved in this instance, I hope that Your Highness will listen to my advice and commence the so-much-needed reform in every department of your State, by reinstating the petitioner^ Bulwuntrao Luximon, whose security money is at the present moment lodged with the bonds in the hands of the Senapatee himself, who is the Wywutdar of the Mahal. No reply to this yad has been received, and the petitioner is without redress. The particulars of this case fully appear from Yad to the Durbar No. 2420 of October 11th, 1873^ of which the follow ing is dn extract :— Your Highness^—Patels, Narrayen Purshotum^ Jewun Nuthoo- bhai, Bapoo Umta, and Harribhai Purshotum^ of Sookra village, under the Baroda Purgunna,have brought to my notice the following distressing circumstances, in the hope that Your Highness may give them immediate relief from the injustice and oppression to which they have been subjected by one Gopal Kashee, a resident of their village, who is sup ported by Nutwalal, Thanedar, Luximeedass Eughoonath, the Police Patel, and Jalalbhai, Havildar. Their case appears to be as follows:—Their families have been pro prietors of the fifth part of the Sukra village from time immemorial. They inherited this from their uncles, Nuthoo Narotum, Rojeedass Nurseedass, and Mahadev Nurseedass, as will be seen from the accompanying lineal trees. They have also been in possession of the property for upwards of 20 years. In Sumvut 1921 the land in their village was assessed for 10 years at Rs. 8 per komba, and securities were taken from them for the payment of that rate on all the lands belonging to these persons. Notwith standing these arrangements, the land was re-assessed in Sumvut 1923 and Ks. 9-8 per komba were fixed. This increased assessment has been paid without any demur whatever, but notwithstanding this submission on their part, Gopal Kashee, supported by the abovenamed village authori ties, has demanded from them a few koombas of land as a bribe; otherwise he would attach their claim to the property which they had inherited from their uncle. The three patels refused compliance with this man's request. A report was therefore made to the Durbar in Sumvut 1925 that the three patels in question were in the enjoyment of heirless property, and that if the same were made over to Gopal Kashee, he would pay a nuzerana at Rs. 6,000. The Durbar gave immediate orders that Gopal Kashee was to be put in immediate pos session of the said land ; and Gopal Kashee taking the order with him came to the village and seized Narrayen Purshotum, and requested him to sign a paper without informing him of its contents. Narayen Purshotum declined to sign; whereupon he was threatened with severe punishment, to avoid which he and the two other patels fled to the neighbouring village of Dodka. Gopal Kashee then took possession of the lands belonging to the aforesaid patels as well as the standing crops on them to84 SCHEDULE No. 111.— continued. No. Name of Claimants, &amp;c.

This is one of those cases that threatens the peace of the neighbourhood in which it has taken place; hence the necessity for careful action on the part of the Durbar regarding it. 2.

It should also be stated that the Gaekwar Government had no share whatever in the village up to that time. It appears^ however, that in the year Sumvut 1924 ( a.d. 1867-68) a survey was commenced on behalf of the Gaekwar Government, when Balvuntrao Deo (the present Judge of the Varisht Court at Baroda), who was then Komavishdar of Uni- rieli, conspired with the fourth sharer, Ketabhai, in considera tion of a bribe which the latter is said to have given him, to enter 3^000 beeghas of Gaekwar Government land out of the village of Shapur into the limits of the village of Manpur, and 2,000 beeghas of Government land from Mewasa was represented as belonging to the said Khetabhai. Khetabhai gave Bulvantrao Deo Rs. 40,000 on account of this transaction, without the knowledge of the other three sharers, who only came to know of it when Khetabhai demanded from them the sum of Rs. 20,000, the half-payment of the above bribe. They at once refused to pay the amount, stating that they would never consent to the participation h 1 such a fraud, which, if found out, would of course deprive them of their village of Manpur altogether. the value of Rs 3,864-8. In addition to this the said Gopal Kashee in the same year, Sumvut 1925^ forcibly extorted I Rs. 2.321 in addition, and in 1927 Rs. 2,236, forming a grand I total, Rs. 6,072. He has also taken away 200 cart-loads of manure, and realized for the fruits, vegetables^ timber, &amp;c., I Rs. 3,000 for the last five years. In Sumvut 1926 the i said Gopal Kashee took possession of the complainants houses. The complainants . state that they have frequently sought redress from the Durbar without success, and at last, through sheer helplessness, they offered last year to give the said Gopal Kashee the sum of Rs. 6,000 if he would hand over to them their land which he did last year, but kept back 14 kombas for his own use. He has made the following entry regarding this transaction in their account book, viz. ;—' That in consideration of having received the sum of Rs. 6,239^, the said Gopal Kashee has sold to the complainants all the land forming their deceased uncles share of the ancestral property of which he had received charge on payment of the nuzerana.' , Although the said Gopal Kashee charged the complainants Rs. 239 as interest on the nuzerana and entered the same in their book, he has again within the last day or two extorted the sum of Rs. 1,455 from the complainant's securities under the pre tence of its being further interest on the nuzerana and the securities now threaten to sell complainants houses, &amp;c. Altogether Gopal Kashee has deprived the complainants of about Rs. 16,000 worth of property^ details of which have been furnished. The facts of the case appear to be as follows, as already brought to the notice of His Highness the Gaekwar in a yad, of which the following is an extract:— The village of Manpar has^ from time immemorial, belonged to the four Thakores named in 1. Gogharee Purtabsingjee Mela bhai.85 SCHEDULE No. III.— continued. Khetablaai, becoming alarmed at this state of affairs, and fearing lest his co-sharers should complain against him^ forged a bond purporting to be signed by the three first-named sharers for Es. 16,000^ which he alleged had been given by them in part payment of the abovementioned fraudulent transac tion; he also at the same time raised a fictitious dispute about certain land, and on these grounds refused to pay the first-named sharers their share of the produce. Up to the present day, the alleged bond for Us, 16^000 has never been shown to the three sharers aforesaid. One of them, Purtapsingjee^ represented the above circum stances to the Wywutdar of Umreili^ who immediately at tached the village of Manpur on behalf of the Baroda Go vernment, the produce of the village being deposited with the Shahookar, and. on the 13th of the month of Aso-Wady, Sumvut 1928;, the Wywutdar passed his decision on the matter, a copy whereof is annexed. According to this decision the three first sharers went to receive their shares of the produce of Manpur, when Ketabhai having collected about 50 persons 'came to prevent their doing so„ and at the same time preferred a false complain to the Fouzdar that one of his servants had burnt a stack of hay. Up to the present time the matter has not been settled. The three first-named sharers then proceeded to Baroda on the 5th Poosh Vudya, Sumvut 1928, and reported the matter to the Hoozo©r_, whereupon an order was issued to the Wywutdar to continue the attachment as before. On the 11th of Falgan Vudya, Sumvut 1929, the three peti tioners again represented the case to the Hoozoor, when an order was issued to the Sir Sooba, Hariba Gaekwar, that the attachment should remain in force pending the settlement of the case; but Khetabhai won over Narayenbhai^ the Kamdar of the Sir Sooba, to his side, by means of a bribe, and con sequently Narayenbhai suppressed the report of the three petitioners and urged Khetabhai to petition the Hoozoor that the attachment might be removed. This petition went to the Hoozoor Kambar, Bulvuntrao Deo {the former Wywutdar of Umreili); consequently they decided that until the three petitioners proved that Government land had been taken by giving a bribe, the estates should not be under attachment. They therefore removed the attachment, and thus having fallen into the hands of their enemies, who became their judges, they have been unjustly deprived of their rights up to the present moment. If your Highness will now read Vullee Tar's statement here with attached, you will see how this unfortunately notorious case stands at the present moment, and T trust you will order its being inquired into and settled by an impartial tribunal. No reply has been received from the Durbar to this yad. Statement of Vallee Tar:— For the last eight yea-rs I have served as Vakeel and Kamdar for the three Moolgirasias of Ruttunpur^ in the Umreili Purgunna, Kattiawar. My father filled this office before me. I arrived in Baroda last March in order to represent to the86 SCHEDULE No. III.— No. Number of Claimants ; &lt;fec. General circumstances of each case. Gaekwar Government a case of gross injustice which has been done to my employers^ and which has been under repre sentation to the Gaekwar Government for the last four years or so. Within a week of my arrival I handed in a petition to H. H. the Maharajah, who endorsed it with an order for the Sir Sooba, Hariba Dada, to inquire into it. T took the Shera to Narayenbhai, who toldme to come the next day. I went the third day, when I was told that the matter had been referred to the Wywutdar of Umreili. I then presented a second petition, because the attachment had been raised in favour of one Khetabhai Pathabhai. In reply to this an order was received for the continuance of the attachment. This was in the month of April last. This favourable decision was communicated to my clients in Kattiawar. Seven days after this the defendants in the suit petitioned for the re moval of the attachment again; and H. H. the Maharajah hein» sick at that time, Balvantrao Deo, one of the Judges of the Varisht Court, took the opportunity of raising the attachment again in favour of my opponents. Shortly afterwards I pre sented a petition to the Maharajah representing that the conflicting orders just referred to had been passed in this case; in reply to this I was informed that the last decision was confirmed. I then made a petition to the Resident repre senting the whole case^ which was returned to me with an endorsement that I should complain to Colonel Walker, the Assistant Resident in charge Umreili. A petition was accordingly made to the Assistant Resident, who requested the Wyutdar of Umreili to send to him the papers of the case. On this the Wywutdar requested instructions from the Hoozoor, as to whether the papers of the case were to be sent to Colonel Walker as desired by that officer. I was often sent for by Hariba Gaekwar, the Sir Sooba^ who told me that I must give a penalty bond promising to pay the sum of Rs. 20^000 if I failed to establish my case including the charge of bribery against Balwuntrao DeOj, and also to enter into a personal recognizance in the sum of Rs. 2^000 for my presence. I signed the documents as requested and the case was sent into the Civil Court of Nanajee Yeshvant. He looked into the papers of the case, told me that my case was just^and that he would speak to the Maharajah on the subject, shortly afterwards Nanajee Yeshvant took me to the Maharajah in Durbar. The Maharajah told me that I must produce three powers of attorney from my clients each on four-rupee stamp, instead of the half-rupee stamp that I had produced. This was complied with at once^ and then the case was ordered to proceed. Upon this Bulwuntrao Deo attacked Nanajee Yeshvant about reviv ing the case and accused him of having taken a bribe in con nection with it. Nanajee Yeshvant retorted, and a row occurred between the two judges^ each accusing the other of taking bribes, and this lasted for about two hours and a half, and no other case was tried. This is a well known fact. Next day tne defendant put in a petition that Nanajee Yeshvant had been bribed and expressed his unwillingness to allow the easel to be proceeded with in his Court. On this the Maharajah re- transferred the case to the High Court, of which the accused balwuntrao Deo was himself a Judge. I then petitioned the Resident and stated my unwillingness to go to theHig^ 1 Court under all the circumstances of the case. I was ex amined by the Assistant Resident, and the Resident forwarded my petition to the Durbar. A day or two after this I waS sent for by Apa Sahib, the son of Babajee Yeshvant^ the Sir h ouzdar. He asked me whether I had made any petition to87 SCHEDULE No. III. — continue 'tack No. Names of Claimants^ &amp;c. * ^VOUjU 5Ult 1 jahrepitt; wl bees pi; hat tiek ontotkl sretmeh ainloflii mrel li Resident! toliklki quested k .f' 14 v iktofe SirSA promiaf 1 isli mjfc aoDeo,® the ® : juiSWsii- ourtoffe ktotinq ;t«niej ;tead 8i ' ■his retortf; j ' Jlk^ at« ft ''of tit' &gt;5 ^ J Note.—It is quite true that the Vakeel was imprisoned on account of his hav ing come to the Residency to represent his case, and he was only released on the Resident's demand.

I answered in the affirmative ; on this I was sent in charge of a Karkoon, Kesharao Manick^, and a police peon to Balwuntrao Deo^ and Narayenbhai who asked me whether I petitioned the Resident. I answered that I had. They then asked me whether I had referred to a khurita of Gunputrao Maharajah in which he had promised to turn out all his servants who had been discharged by the British Go vernment for misconduct. I said, that I had referred to that khurita on which Balwuntrao Deo told me that I was liable to ten years' rigorous imprisonment, and ordered me to be taken away and imprisoned in a cell in the Fouzdar^s Kutcherry. Two KarkooDS and six police peons were then sent with me to my house^ and they seized all my papers and took them to the Fouzdar, and I was sent back to prison. I remained there for fifteen days, and was only released on a demand from the Resident to know why I was imprisoned. I was then dis charged. My duftur was then returned tome and 1 passed a receipt for the same. I found on subsequent examination that copies of three petitions that I made to the Resident and some letters that I received from my employers and friends in Kattiawar are missing. I then obtained permission from the Resident to reside in camp and have been here ever since. On the 20th of August I represented the whole of my clients' case to the Resident and solicited his interference in the matter, because, as shown above, I could not obtain redress from the Durbar. 1 have not received any reply as yet to that petition. It would take more time than can at present be spared to sub mit to the Commission in detail the questions of guaranteed and other Girasias, Wanta-holders, land and boundary dis putes, cases of extradition and jurisdiction, failure to give effect to Government decisions, transit dues^ customs, chow- kees, &amp;c., &amp;c., which are at present pending between the Resident and the Gaekwar Government. It will be sufficient to state in general terms with regard to them, that there are about 250 giras cases to be settled, besides nearly the same number of other references on different subjects ; and it is quite clear that unless a very different mode of conducting business, than that now followed by the Gaekwar Government is adopted^ the just and equitable settlement of these vexed questions appears to be hopeless ; consequently that persons entitled to our protection must continue to suffer great loss. Within the last day or two I have found the following valu able evidence in my office upon the present state of our busi ness intercourse with the Baroda Durbar.

Barton, the Politi cal Agent of the Rewa Kanta, an officer of upwards of twenty years' experience in Baroda itself—part of that period having passed as Assistant Resident—and of Captain Reeves^ the acting Political Agent who drew up the report in question. In para. 252 of the report. Captain Reeves says ' The rela- ' tion of this Agency with the Gaekwar could not well be in a more unsatisfactory state. I will quote what Colonel Bar- ton has said on this subject in a letter now before Govern- ' ment (viz., 17th October 1872)'— i ISCHEDULE No. * I can fully endorse this opinion as ap plicable to my own experience. I need every possible effort to have busi ness cases settled amicably and equit ably but to no purpose. R. P. f With regard to Girass rights, Lieut. Stace/R.A., who has during the past two seasons been inquiring into the claims of guaranteed Girassia's has reported to me^ that the system of compelling wit nesses to give evidence favourable to the Gaekwar Government and pro tanto destructive of the rights of Girassias, by imprisonment and other forcible means^ is habitually employed by the Durbar. A case lias recently been brought to notice by Captain Keeves, Yad No. 2320, dated 27tli Sep tember 1873, in which a Wanta subject was kept in prison for a year and a quarter by the Durbar before being surrendered for trial; and when tried by the Political Assistant he was found not guilty of any offence. No reply has been vouchsafed to the Resi dent's yad ; which is dated 15th October last. Colonel Barton's opinion. JVote. —This flat denial of perfectly true allega tions is a most serious matter. Vide the case of the two Joonaghur girls, and others in which deliberate false statements have been made. Captain Reeves's Report resumed. The Sirdars, and indeed all the upper classes of the Baroda State fare the same, even relatives of the family. General circumstances of each case. Note. —^The Resident in 1873 charged the Gaekwar Government as follows; - 1. Oppression of certain British and foreign subjects in the administration of justice. 2. Discontent of the Sirdars, Silledars, Wuttundars, J agheerdars, Thakores, Ryots^, Kolees^ &amp;c., as dangerous to the peace of the country. I regret to report that the attitude assumed by the Durbar u officials forbids any hope of the slightest intention or en- a deavour on their part to act in a spirit of conciliation^ or ' even of common fairness, in the innumerable cases pending a between the Durbar and the Agency * ' The Wanta inhabitants are treated with severity and cruelty; ' their crops have been impounded with or without protest; u they are carried away, imprisoned, and fined at the will of the ' local authority. The fgiras's rights of the Talookdars are withheld ; the payments of settled hucksfrom the local trea- ' suries are'made irregularly ; and difficulty and delay are ex- ' perienced by the recipients in obtaining their rights. Wanta- ' lands are encroached upon, and all suggestions for a settle- ' ment are evaded. Demands for surrender of individuals ' accused of committing offences in Rewa Kanta limits are^ as a ' rule, not complied with, and are generally met by counter- a charges. The acts of local officials, however arbitary or ' illegal, are upheld and justified, and any representations from ' this Agency are either treated with contempt or denied ' pointblank. ' In short, business is at a standstill, or rather unrestrained ' oppression and tyranny are practised towards the Rewa ' Kanta subjects by the Baroda local officials. Redress is un- &lt;( attainable, and were it not that those dependent on this ' Agency are held in check and that retaliation is not allowed, ' the whole border country would be in a state of anarchy. ' The only means of redress open to this Agency is to repre- ' sent each individual case to the Resident and to request Xl his assistance. Each case is prepared by my local subordi- (i nates as carefully as possible under the circumstances, and ' is forwarded through the Resident to the Durbar. Months ' elapse before o.ny reply is received, and the usual answer is ' a flat denial of the complainant's allegations. ' The Durbar never lose an opportunity of snubbing one of ' the more powerful Rewa Kanta chiefs, or oppressing and ' encroaching upon the rights of the weaker ones; and in this ' term all Girassias and Bhayads of Thakores are included, ' nor, as far as the records show, have any attempt been made ' to check the Gaekwar and his advisers in this course ot u policy * * * ' In a word, it must sometimes appear to people as if the name of the British Government as a controlling and paramount power in this part of Gujarat did not exist.' The Resident respectfully invites the attention of the Commis sion to Colonel Barton's report that more than a year ago 'business is at a standstill; that unrestrained oppression and tyranny were practised towards Rewa Kanta subjects by the Baroda local officials; that redress was unattainable; and that were it not that the Rewa Kanta people were held in check the whole border country would be in a state of anarchy. Com pare* this and other passages of a similar purport with mar ginal note and the specific instances brought forward.89 SCHEDULE No. III.— continued. 3. Serious general maladminstration of the Baroda State in the Revenue, Police, and Judicial Departments ; —re sulting in general insecurity of life and property of all classes^ amounting to persecution in certain instances. 4. Bribery and corruption amongst the high officials of the State^ including Wywutdars, Fouzdars, &amp;c., &amp;c. 5; Abduction of respectable women from their families to serve as loundees. 6. Inefficiency of the contingent of 3,000 Horse—its condition being far below the standard provided for by Treaty, 27 Boundary disputes. 10 Claims to jurisdiction. 27 Claims to deserted and populated villages. In addition to the cases brought forward in these schedules^ there still remain 1,385 petitions, upon which no action has been taken by the Resident. 288 refer to complaints about civil matters. 297 do Revenue do. 118 do Girass do. 173 do Criminal cases. 414 do complaints against officials. 95 Miscellaneous. It is submitted that in this and other sentences of the report quoted above, we have a perfectly true description of much that has subsequently and quite independently been brought to light in the cases of the Sirdars^ the Thacores, the Wut- tundars, the Jagheerdars, the Ryots, the Bankers^ His High ness Khunderao s followers and other servants of the Baroda State. 4r We see also that instead of principles of reciprocity governing the relations between the two States, as they ought to do, ' counter charges' or a system of counter attack^ characterise the proceedings of the Durbar to an extent that is not merely disrespectful to British officers, but insulting to their Gov ernment. In the events which are now taking place in Now- sari and elsewhere, even with regard to persons who come to Baroda to complain to the British Government of their grievances, we have significant instances of the system of reta liation that will be indulged in unless authoritatively checked. Verifying Colonel Barton^s experience that the ' acts of the local officials, however arbitrary or illegal are upheld and justi fied, and any representations from the Agency are treated with contempt or denied point blank.' The present system of administration in short unsettles every thing and settles nothing. Its effect upon the borders of Pahlanpur and the petty States under that Agency with which it comes in contact is most injurious in every way. A few months ago there were upwards * of villages deserted in Kankrij alone owing to claims put forward by the Baroda Durbar to them according to its normal spirit of encroach ment—a spirit that must be systematically and authorita tively checked on all sides. The last Administration Report of the Mahi Kanta also contains^ in para. 31, a complaint that the Thakore of Mansa cannot obtain his dues on Wanta lands in the Kurree Purgunna, though repeatedly applied for. Again^ u under the head Police, Lieutenant Hunter, Assistant Political Agent, Mahi Kanta, reports that the Baroda officials invariably repudiate their responsibility when thieves are tracked into their territory although the village system is kept up.' Again the same officer reports ^ complainants of the Mahi Kanta must now appear in the Baroda District Revenue Courts and prosecute their claims, there is no guarantee that they obtain justice. My own experience has shown me that the contrary is the case. In a recent case I proved the revenue officer had made a false report of the settlement of the claims, and compensation was eventually paid. In some cases the theft of a few seers of grain drags on a weary correspondence for several years. In short, whether it is on behalf of the business of Political Agents of Native States, or of the Collectors of neighbouring British Districts, the Residents advice tendered to H. H. the present Gaekwar according to Treaty, has seldom^ if ever been followed, even, though sound, just, and friendly. Nume rous instances of this may be quoted between 1871 and the present time. Hence ' business is at a stand still,' and will remain so until the whole system of Durbar administration is changed from what it is at present. - R.

S ir, In reply to your letter No. 46, dated loth instant, I have the honor to acquaint you that I consider the cases already submitted to the Commission to be amply sufficient to establish the general charges brought by me against the administration of the Gaekwar State. It is obvious, however, from the list of petitions still undisposed of in my office that, were it necessary, any number of additional cases could be brought forward. 2. I will submit as soon as possible the statements which I have still to make upon certain cases and groups of cases, which have been under enquiry by the Commission. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) R. PHAYRE, Colonel, Resident.SCHEDULE No. I. C ase N o. 4. Seiad Sadak M i. 1. Sadak Ali Maddat Ali, Musalman, 40 years, Camel Contractor of Alimedabad, states:— My father came from Hindustan when I was a child two or three years old, and settled in Ahmedabad. I am, and have been for many years, a British sub ject living and settled in Ahmedabad, where my house and family are. My connection with the Baroda Government first began when the late Khanderao came to Kattywar. I do not remember the year. I have held con tracts from time to time since then from the Gaekwar's Government, and at the time of Khanderao's death, I had the following establishment under him:— 122 camels at Rs. 15 per pair per mensem; of these 51 were in the head quarter's paga, and 71 employed in the batteries, regiments, and other branches of the establishment. After Khanderao's death a Karkun of Balvantrao Eaholkar's said there would be a difficulty in keeping up my establishment. I told him I had to pay Rs. 12,000 to the men from whom I had bought the camels, and that I was at a loss what to do. He offered to settle the matter with the Dewan if I would give him Rs. 1,000. After some talk I paid Rs. 400 to him in cash, and begged that Rs. 400 more might be deducted from the arrears of Rs. 3,000 pay due to me. He would not agree to this, and said I must pay the whole amount before I received the 'chits' for my pay. Matters remained thus for some six or seven months (about May 1871), when he represented to the Dewan that I had abused him, whereupon my property, as detailed below, was attached and confiscated:— 94 camels, 1 shigram and pair of bullocks, 1 buffalo, 2 country carts. I complained about this to Colonel Barr, and to the authorities in Bombay, but no attention was paid to me. Shortly afterwards, the Dewan sent for me to his house, on the pretence of making a contract with me for 200 camels to go to Junaghad. From there I was taken by some sepoys, and put into jail. Seven days after, Appa Sahib (the son of Balvantrao Eshvantrao, one of the Durbar Agents now present) and one Tatya Punekar, with three or four sepoys, took me one night to the Raholkar (Balvant rao Dewan). I was handcuffed, my hands being fastened behind my back. The Raholkar ordered me to give a receipt in full for all my arrears, and to sign a statement that I had no complaint to make to the British Government against the Gaekwar's Government. I represented that I owed Rs. 10,000 or Rs. 12,000 to my creditors for the camels, and that if I signed such a paper I could not settle my accounts with them. Upon this the Raholkar ordered the men to ' make me consent and sign such a document.' Thereupon they tied a rope to the hand cuffs, and fastening it to the roof they pulled me up by the wrists. In doing so I swung round, and, falling to the ground, 1 broke my right arm above the wrist. (The complainant shows his arm, which is in a useless and fractured state). Seeing this they took me back to jail, where I remained for some six weeks, and was only released on my wife petitioning the Resident, Colonel Shortt. I was made to sign a bond for Rs. 200 not to go near the Palace, the Raholkar's house, or the Head Quarter's paga. My wife was also made to refund at double rates the amount of subsistence allowance which had been expended for me in jail. On my release I made a complaint to the Resident, who transferred my case to the Assistant Resident for disposal. That officer called for the Foujdar and his i—4 aAt. v 1 Karkun to be sent up, and, after making an investigation, lie directed that the frrears of Rs. 3,000, and all my property which had been confiscated shonld he restored to me. I further claimed Bs. 7,000 as com ? ensation for the loss and injury I had sustained, but the Assistant Eesident said he had no authority to enquire into that, and directed me to go to the Resident. This all took place m the presence of the Senapati's Karkun Balvantrao. After the Assistant's order was passed, the Foujdar Balvantrao and Bapu Sahib, (two of the Dnrbar's Agents now present), with two more persons, went to the Resident, and informed him that the Maharaja was very much hurt and annoyed at the order passed by the Assistant. The Resident told me this, and ordered me to go away. I did so and came back in five or six days, when he told me I was to get nothing at all. I then asked him for my petition and papers, and was told he knew nothing about them. Not long after this the Governor came to Ahmedabad, and I represented my case to him, giving him a written petition, which he took to Bombay. During my absence in Ahmedabad, my wife left my house in Baroda, taking with her Rs. 2,000 of my property. She has not returned to me. When i came back to Baroda, one girl and two boys, whom I had brought up from theii infancy, represented to the Foujdar that I had beaten them, and were told they mio-ht leave my house and protection if they chose to do so, which they did. Hearing that I was to be re-arrested, I left Baroda, and went to Bombay and Poona, where I lived for about six months. I then returned to the camp here, and found that a ' Rath ' (chariot) of mine, for which I had given Rs. 260, had been sold by auction by order of the Durbar for Rs. 8. I have been living in great poverty and distress since my return, and have made many com plaints about my losses, but have as yet received no redress or compensation. The witness being recalled, and asked to fix the periods as closely as he can, at which the various events detailed by him occurred, states as follows :— Seven months after Khanderao's death my property was attached: Five or six months after my property was attached, I was imprisoned : Six or seven days after I was imprisoned, my arm was broken : Forty-two days after my arm was broken, I was released: Three or four days after I was released, I petitioned the Resident: Five or six months after I petitioned the Resident, the Assistant Resident passed his order on my case : Khanderao Maharaj died on 4th day of Ramzan, three years ago. The Durbar reserve cross-examination. Sadak Ali, recalled, states—Bhadarkhan Ismal Khan was never in my service. He is in the Graekwar's employment. I called him as a witness to prove the fact of my imprisonment. Every one in the city knew I had been sent to prison. Reply of the Durbar. Complainant is not a British subject. His stay previous to his arrest in Ba roda was more than six months, and he thereby became a Gaekwari subject. 2. He owes about Rs. 400 to the State, to settle which, he was called by Balvantrao Pimplekar, Karkun of the Khas paga, whom he treated impudently and threatened to beat. He was therefore taken before Balvantrao Raholkar, the Naib Dewan, by whom he was sent to the Foujdari, with a yadi to have liim bound over to keep the peace. The security not being given, he was detained at the Police Station, (Chabutra,) for 1 month and 20 days, when, on giving security, he was released. He was not chained, nor handcuffed, nor treated in the manner which he describes.3 With regard to the injury, it appears from the description roll of prisoners, and the evidence of witnesses, that he had sustained it previous to his arrest. The witnesses are the Police officers at the Station. Colonel Shortt did not mention to the Durbar Agents, or write any yad to the Durbar that complainant's arm was broken in the jail. A yad has been sent to Colonel Phayre from the Durbar stating that the complainant had not been put in jail (' keid it thevila nohota'). This might appear to be contradictory of our present statement, and we would suggest that either a mistake was made at the time of writing that yad, or that there had been a misunderstanding of the word 'keid,' which, strictly speaking, means jail. ' Chabutra' means a police guard-house, and it was in the ' chabutra' he was confined. That yad was written on the report of the Karkun Balvantrao Pimplekar. He is the man mentioned above. The Descriptive Register of Chabutra Prisoners is produced by the Durbar Agent, and, on inspection by the Commission, is found to contain the usual re cord of the complainant's committal on the 22nd April 1872. In the column of &lt;£ Description of the prisoners' is the remark in a separate line, ' is an injury.' This line appears to the Commission to be written by a different hand, and at a different time from the rest of the record in that column. Further statement of the Durbar, made on the 17th December 1873, after production and examination before the Commission of the Register of Prisoners received in the chabutra. The statement we made on the 13th instant, as to the injury to Sadak Ali 's arm, when he was first admitted to the chabutra, was made on the strength of a copy furnished to us by Karkun Wamanrao, but on seeing the original Register of Prisoners received, and carefully examining the entry, are of opinion that it is of so suspicious a character, that we desire to withdraw it as evidence. We shall make an inquiry with respect to the apparent addition to the entry. • S chedule No. I. C ase No. 2. Seiad Sadak Ali. British subject. 2.

He was imprisoned in the chabutra, and 4 or 5 days afterwards his wife told me I was discharged. It was 2 months or so after the Maharaj Kanderao's death that this happened.

He was brought back at 10 or 11 p.m . and was put into a separate cell. We, prisoners, were instructed to hold no conversation with him, or we should get two dozen lashes. He was calling out as if in pain, but I did not ask him the reason of his grief, as I was _ afraid of beino- flogged. I was for 20 or 22 days afterwards m prison, with Seiad Sadak Ali. &amp; He pointed to his arm as if in pain. I do not know what injury had happened to his arm. I was in prison on a charge of murder. I was sent to Kaira with two others and was there tried. They were hanged I heard, but I was acquitted. The Durbar Agents reserve cross -examination. Extract of letter from Capt. G, B, Hancock, to the Secretary, Baroda Commission, dated 20th December 1873. ' J remember the case of the Camel Contractor Seiad Sadak Ali. It was referred to me for report by Colonel Shortt, and I made a summary of the ac- ' counts (in English), resulting in favour of the Contractor, to some small amount. ' Colonel Shortt did not accept my finding, and subsequently continued the f( investigation of the case himself, deciding eventually against the Camelman. ' At the time of inquiry before me, I remember no mention of the Contractor's ' arm having been broken, or of other torture having been practised upon him by ' the Durbar officials, and it formed no part of his complaint.' Statement of SurgeoiirMajor G. E. Seward, Residency Surgeon, Baroda, 1873, I have this day examined the right arm of Seiad Sadak Ali Maddat Ali, and having heard the statement which he made yesterday before the Resident read to me, I am of opinion that the manner in which the fracture is said to have taken place has been truly set forth. Both the radius and ulna have been frao tured. There has evidently been a subsequent suppuration. The bones are widely disunited, and the effect of any surgical operation to remedy this state of things would be doubtful. The arm is perfectly useless, unless with the aid of mechanical appliances, and even those would lend but an imperfect use to the member. The above having been read over to Dr. Seward, he acknowledges it to be correct, (Signed) R. PHAYRE, Colonel, Resident. Dr. Seward appears before the Commission and after re-examining the arm, states; I am of opinion that the injury to Sadak All's arm could not have been done by the bite of a camel, on the ground that a camel having two rows of teeth, there would have been an extensive cicatrix on both sides of the arm; and 2nd, that if the force had been sufficient to fracture the arm, the bones would have been broken on both sides, that is, at the point of impact with the&lt;0 camel s teeth tlieie sliould have been an equal injury on both bones, whereas one bone 'was fiacturecl short, and the other at a considerable length above it. If the man had been absolutely lifted off the ground, it is possible that dislocation of the arm might ha\e followed j but before that could occur the agony would have been so intolerable, that the person under torture would probably do precisely what badak Ah says he did, roll over on one arm or the other. It would be difficult to form a precise opinion as to when the fracture occurred, but the pi ebent condition of the arm shews that the accident must have happened at least 18 months ago. The Durbar Agents decline to cross-examine. Final Statement by the Resident, Having omitted to obtain the evidence recorded by the Commission in this case, lam unable to refer to it specifically, but the Durbar reply has been furnished to me, and I have a good knowledge of the facts of the case generally. On His Highness Khanderao's death, Sadak Ali, who was a large camel con tractor for the troops, &amp;c. &amp;c., got into trouble with the officials of the new regime, just as many others did about the same time. In this instance, ihe Kamdar of the Khas Paga, one Balvantrao Pimplekar, intimated to Sadak Ali that his contract could not be continued unless he paid him a bribe of Es. 800. After some altercation Sadak Ah agreed to this, but, as large arrears of pay were due to him, he could only manage to pay Rs. 400, and left the remainder for future adjustment. This was not approved by Pimplekar; a quarrel ensued, and a complaint was made to the Acting Dewan, Raholkar, that Sadak Ali had threatened Pimplekar, who was really working for Eaholkar in the whole matter. His camels were then seized, and the whole of his property confiscated. He at once complained to the Durbar of this treatment, and appears to have continued doing so till he at length addressed the then Resident, Colonel Barr, in September and October 1871, to the effect that Raholkar had seized his property and intended impri soning him. Not having obtained redress, he went to Ahmedabad, and petitioned the Resident again, through the Magistrate of the District, under date 1st December 1871. He again failed to obtain redress, but appears to have continued representing his case, till at length Raholkar being determined to be rid of his im portunity in complaining to the Resident, threw him into prison. On being first taken to prison, he was stripped, examined, and a minute description of him entered in the Prison Register. This was in April 1872. About a week afterwards, Sadak Ali was taken before Raholkar, to his private residence, about 9 p.m ., and he was there and then told to give an acquittance in full of all demands upon him in regard to pay and property, and further that he would never again com plain to the British authorities. Sadak Ali declined to do anything of the sort; he was therefore at once seized and tortured, in order to make him yield to the demands of his persecutors. During the process his right arm was broken in two between the wrist and elbow. He was sent back to prison, and left to take his chance, without any medical man being allowed to visit him. He probably would have remained in prison to this day had not his wife presented a petition to the Resident, on or about the 11th of May 1872, stating that she and her husband were British subjects, that he had been thrown into prison a fortnight previously, and imploring the Resident's interference to have him released. Under such circumstances. Colonel Shortt, the Resident, at once referred this petition to the Durbar for explanation. No reply was received to his yad for about three months, and when one came, in Durbar yad No. 1082, dated 15th August 1872, the fact of Sadak Ali's being a British subject was not called in question, but a flat denial was given to the fact that he had been imprisoned at all, and it was declared that he had no claims whatever—on the contrary, that he owed money to the Durbar. Sadak Ali himself had been released in the interim, i—4 hand was endeavouring to obtain possession of his confiscated property, and his 'rears of pay. This 'state of affairs appears to have &gt;872. during which time 0^—Ke^^p^ Note.—No decisions of ^ayin^ been approved of by Colonel Sliortt, was not either of these officers are on acted on arit [ the petitioner was again finally miormed record in the office. . ^ ^ ] ; ad no case&gt; During this period, viz., from June to October, whilst his case regarding pay and property was pending, Sadak All appears to have said nothmg about the fracture of his arm, by torture, for obvious personal reasons. Indeed, ithasheen already seen that in August, the very fact of his having been in prison at all was boldly denied by the Durbar in their yad quoted above a fact which must have prejudiced his case. It was not, therefore, till November 18/., after his claims for both pay and camels, Ac., on the Durbar had been rejected, that he mentioned the fact of his having been tortured to Colonel Shortt, who appears to have taken no notice of it, excepting by a remark to the eficct that the Raholkar who did it had been removed from office. The case came nnder my notice in October 1873, and on the 10th of that month I addressed His Highness on the subject, asking him to do t ie man justice in respect to his broken arm, which had never before been lepresented , and with refgrgiicg to tliG positivG dGnial of tliG lact of tlio mail s naying uggu ini- prisoned in the previous April, I wrote as follows : ' With the evidence now before me, I cannot accept your Highness's yad to Colonel Shortt, No. 1802 of 15th August 1872, which denies the fact of Seiad Sadak Ali having been imprisoned at all, as conveying the real facts of the complainant s case, in regard to the torture and imprisonment, took place between the end of April and first part of June 1872.' No answer to this letter has ever been received by me, but on the trial be fore the Commission the Durbar, in consequence of what I have written above, abandoned their false report about the imprisonment, and vainly endeavoured to explain it away by attempting to apply a meaning to certain words in the yad of which they were not capable. In fact, the Durbar yad of August 15th, 1872, must be interpreted with reference to the wife's petition, and the yad to which it was a reply, and in which the word ' keid' could not have been used to mean 'jail,' but obviously to mean 'imprisonment,' as will be found from the context. Were this an isolated instance of this kind of unscrupulous and deliberate false statement on the part of the Durbar, they might receive the benefit of any doubt that might arise on the subject, in consequence of their version of the meaning, were there room for any. All doubt, however, as to the intention of the Durbar in this case is removed by what subsequently took place in presence of the Commission themselves. On the 13th December the Durbar Agent, in his reply to this case, stated that 'with regard to the injury it appears from the descriptive roll of prisoners, and the evidence of witnesses, that he had sustained it previous to his arrest. The witnesses are the Police officers at the station.' In support of this statement an extract from the Register Book of the Prison called the ' Sheher Chabutra ' was produced by the Durbar, but no witnesses were called to support it at that time, although it would appear from the above that their evidence had been already taken by the Durbar. I suggested that the book itself should be produced in place of the extract put into Court, which was afterwards done, when the false entry recorded in the proceedings was immediately detected by the Commission, but denied stoutly by the Durbar Karkun Wamanrao. Eventually, however, the Durbar acknow ledged the suspicious character of the entry, and withdrew the book as evidence.q J 7 Thus tlie several attempts on the part of the Durbar, 1st, to deny Sadak Ali's imprisonment by them; 2nd, to establish the fact that the injury occurred to his arm before his arrest by them; and 3rdj their preparation of false evidence by means of ' the Police officers of the station,' so completely expose their deliberate and intentional in this matter as to render them utterly unworthy of credit in regard to it, and I therefore trust that the Commission may be pleased to give the poor man Sadak Ali the full benefit of this damaging evidence against the Durbar. I would respectfully submit, for the consideration of the Commission, that the conduct of the Durbar is highly aggravated by the fact of their having heard the solemn injunctions which the Commission laid upon every witness who ap peared before it to speak the truth, and the warning of what the consequence would be if he gave false evidence. One or two Durbar sen - ants that Sadak Ali called to prove the fact of his imprisonment, were the first persons who gave hearsay evidence to the effect that Sadak Ali's arm had been injured by a camel at Ahmedabad. This evidence was subsequently .shown to be false by the Register Book, which apart from the false entry, proved that Sadak Ali had no injury or mark on his arm when he went into prison on the 22nd April as those persons swore he had. Moreover, Dr. Seward's evidence proved that there was no reason to believe that Sadak Ali's arm had been broken by the bite of a camel; on the contrary, that had the arm been broken in that way, there would have been evident signs of it. In the marginal note to Case 38, Schedule IL, this case is one of those cited by me in the proof of my general charge against the Gaekwar Government, that ' under the present system of administration no reliance can, as a rule, be placed upon Durbar official statements, in matters affecting the administration of public justice.' When I wrote that, I referred, so far as this case is concerned, to the flat denial of the imprisonment made in the yad of 15th August 1872, but I had no idea that such additional proof of the charge as has come to light in the presence of the Commission would have been afforded. Precis of the Petition of Seiad Sadak Ali, dated 11th November 1872. 1. When I went to Balvantrao Raholkar to demand my dues, my contract was cancelled, and he told me to pass a document to the effect that I had received all my pay, and that 1 would not complain to the British Government. I refused to comply with this demand. 1 was consequently imprisoned, handcuffed, and beaten. The result was the breakage of my arm. 2. I demand the price of 4 camels given to one Ismal Bapu. 3. The people owe me about Rs. 1,000 or 1,500. The account is with a Bania, who may be asked for it. 4. I pray for the removal of the attachment over the camels, shigram, &amp;c., in consequence of my not paying more than Rs. 400 to one Balvantrao Pim- plekar. 5. I request the restoration of one camel, which is with theThakor of Miagam. 6. I solicit a receipt from one Jetha Parekh, who is in charge of eight pagas for the surplus equipment of camels, which he took away. A verbal answer was given to the petitioner by the Resident on the 16th November 1872, viz., that his petition was returned.Substance of a Marathi Yad No. 1802, dated ISth August 1874 to the address of the Resident, from H. H. the Gaekwar Malharao Maharaj. States, in reply to the Eesident's yad No. 1018 of the 11th May 1872, ask- inff explanation as to why Seiad Sadak Ah (the husband of one Bae Nanu, of Ahmedabad), who had been to the Durbar Officers, asking for_ a payment of money due to him on account of^ his contract for supplying camels, had been imprisoned, that from the particulars laid before the Durbar by the Senapati in his Memo. No. 125 of 1872, information is hereby given that under the terms of his contract no payment of money is due by this Government to the said Seiad Sadak Ali as alleged'in his petition, enclosed in the accompaniments, but that on the contrary he owes money to the Government, The petitioner Seiad Sadak, in consequence of his having used threatening language towards the Pagadar Officers, was required to give a security for good conduct. He has not been imprisoned. The accompanying petition is returned.V SCHEDULE I. Case No. 5, Tislo Govmda, Chamar, 40 years, leather seller and cultivator, resident of I unadra, m the Mahikanta, states :—My son, named Nathuva Tislo, aged 17 years, is now at home too ill to come up and make any statement. His feet and legs are a J swollen, and he suffers from fever daily. He is the same person about whom complaints have been made to the Resident, regarding his havino- been seized, fined, and punished by the Vahivatdar of Atarsumba. He is so ill that he cannot be brought here even on a charpoy, and I have no hope that he will ever get well. Punadra is 50 kos (75 miles) from Baroda, 22 kos (33 miles) from Ahmedabad, 18 kos (27 miles) from Sadra. He has been thus ill for the last month. I do not know whether or no they are giving him any medicine at home. His mother is taking care of him, but I cannot say how he now is, as it is 20 days since I left home. 2. Shankar Laldas, Vania, 50 years, Mukhtiar of Pasunj, Daskrohi Taluka, Ahmedabad Zilla, states :—About 2 months ago l islo came to me, and informed me that his son .was imprisoned without cause in Baroda. 1 informed the Political Agent at Sadra, and by his advice I came here and complained to the Resident, who procured the release of JSTathuva in 12 . days. He was then very ill, with feet all swollen, but was able to walk a little. We took him by train to Ahmedabad, and thence by cart to Punadra. About 1 month ago the Resident sent for us again, and I went to Punadra where I saw Nathuva. He was then, 25 days ago, lying In bed, suffering from swollen legs and daily attacks of fever. He was quite unable to move. He was not in his right senses, being unable to answer questions put to him. We therefore came away without him. I heard 15 days ago that he was no better. It is impossible for me to say whether or no he will recover, but when I saw him he was quite unable to come here by any means of conveyance. Statement of the Durbar. The village of Punadra, within the jurisdiction of the Mahi-kanta Agency, be longs to the G-aekwar's district of Atarsumba. It is the seat of a famous shrine of Mahadeo, distinguished by the name of ' Utamteshvar.' It is a place of pil grimage and fairs. The greatest of these fairs falls on the 14th of Magh Yadya, when thousands visit the place; and on the last 14th of Magh Yadya, the con course amounted to thousands. The religious laws of the Hindus prohibit members of inferior castes, such as Dheds (low caste), Bhangis (sweepers), Chamars (shoemakers), as well as of different creeds, such as Musalmans, from entering the temples of Hindu religion. At any rate the popular feeling becomes offended if any individual of an inferior caste enters such places. The sensitiveness of the Hindu mind is so great that they become highly excited, if they happen to discover such an one to have enter ed a Hindu temple in disguise. On the day of the last fair, a shoemaker of Punadra, one Nathuva Tisla by name, had come to the fair. There was nothing wrong so far as coming to the fair was concerned. He however took a disguise and effected an entrance into the room where the principal shrine is situated. He was however detected, given into custody, and kept in confinement. During the investigation held by the Vahivatdar (manager) of Atarsumba, he admitted having entered the temple, and the same having been established by i—5 a2 the evidence of those who had apprehended him, he was found guilty of the heinous crime of profaning the Hindu religion. The proceedings m this case, as well as tlie prisoner, were ordered to be sent up to the Huzur, and bnastns (ex- pounders of laws) were consulted as to the nature of the punishment to be awarded for such a crime on the authority of Maim Smrati, Para slum, and other works on Hindu laws. The Shastris declared that such a graceless profaner should be put to death. This was, however, deemed too severe a punishment, and we thought it advisable to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment for seven years. He was undergoing the sentence, of which four months only had expired, when released. Subjects residing within the British territory, or within what is termed the Mulukgiri limits, if apprehended in the act of committing offences within the Gapk- war's territory are tried and punished by the Courts of this Grovernment, according to the law administered by themj and after the expiration of the teim of punish ment, the authority of the district, ofwhichthe offender happens to be a native, is informed of the same. This practice, and its vice versa, have been in existence from an ancient time. The offender under notice was accordingly apprehended while in the act of committing an offence within the limits of the territory of this (jovernment, and w r as tried, convicted, and sentenced according to the laws in force. There is nothing in this proceecHng which may be deemed unjust or informal. In the month of June last the British Resident, in a memorandum No. 1686, written probably on an application from the criminal's father, Tisla Govinda, desired the Durbar to release the prisoner from confinement, and send him to the Residency on the day after the next to that of the memo., and to investigate the charges advanced against the Vahivatdar and Foujdar of Atarsumba, of receiving a bribe of Rs. 200, and taking an agreement for an additional bribe of Rs. 300, of which 20 were actually paid. This requisition on the part of the Resident was a novel one, and contrary to the existing practice. It was therefore necessary for us to consider how we were to act, and while this subject was under consideration, the memo. No. 1704 was received from the Resident to the same effect. We therefore, in deference to the wishes of the Resident, and with a view to avoid discussion, set the criminal at liberty, and informed the Resident of the same in our reply. As regards the alleged charges of receiving bribes, the Resident was re quested to send the complainant, with whatever proofs he possessed, to the Gaekwar Government. As no one has yet appeared before us, no investigation could be set on foot; and the Vahivatdar, who was made to furnish security, is suffering from the state of suspense under which he has been placed. The practice alluded to in the Resident's memo. No. 1704, in connection Avith offences by parties residing in what are stated the Mulukgiri limits, is not in force. That described above is^ we assure, actually in force. Final Statement by the Resident. The general facts of this case are reported in para. 3 of my letter to Govern ment, No. dated 18th August 1873. 2. If has not been inquired into by the Commission owing to the absence of Nathuva Tisla himself, through severe illness contracted during his false impri sonment of 4 months in the Baroda Jail, consequently it is still pending. . 3- 1 ho Durbar have, however, put forward certain statements which re quire notice.l&gt;K&gt; ''Si, (d.) That Natliuva Tisla entered the temple in question in disguise. (h.)That the Yahivatdar of Atarsumba states that Nathuva Tisla confessed isliUfj that he had entered the temple. (c.)

Consequently it was not bailable. Yet Na- Sentenced according to law thuva Tisla was allowed by the Vahivatdar to return to the nothing unjust* Or - Mahikanta after the bribe was paid. He stayed there 1^ committed, tenu months, after which he was illegally arrested, not through Rpdrlpnt'q varl 1 the Political Agent. Thus the whole proceeding was unjust \ ' ,i - tk i ^ ; and informal. Jf 7 Ay should the Durbar have concealed from desired the JJurbar to release the Commission the fact of the bail and the return of the the prisoner. This wasanovel an , prisoner to his home in the Mahikanta ? proceeding. (/.) Resident's yad No. 1704 was received, and to avoid discussion, the prisoner was released by order of the Durbar. (g.) With regard to the bribes, the complainants have not appeared before the Durbar, therefore the question has not been gone into. 4. With regard to a, h, c, d, and of the above allegations on the part of the Durbar, the deposition of Nathuva Tisla himself, corroborated by other evidence, throws a very different light on the matter. The Vahivatdar of Atar sumba, named Desaibhai, being the person who released the petitioner on his father's paying the sum of Rs. 200, is not worthy of credit in what he states r regarding the petitioner's confession. |0St otil odnmlifj, (1.)

' Nathuva Tisla, 30 years of age, inhabitant of Punadra, in the Mahikanta, chamar and cultivator, Hindu, States on solemn affirmation. o act, ail About the end of last February, I went to the temple of Mahadev near Atar sumba, where I was summoned by the Sirkar to bring grass for the^ sowars of the Gaekwar Grovernment. I had deposited the grass and was returning home, and had occasion to pass near the temple. After going a few paces I was followed by ten or fifteen sepoys of Atarsumba, who accused me of having defiled the temple by s-oino- near it. They beat me with leather thongs, and took me to the Foujdar, who had me boun l and taken to Atarsumba. 1 was ,there fettered and thrown into prison. I remained thus for 15 days. During this time 2 or 3 persons visited me, and said that if I would pay a fine, I should be released. I said that I could not pay it, but that perhaps my father would. A few days after this i was discharged. My father knows about the bail, &amp;c. I then returned home, where I remained for about 2 months. After its expiration the man who went bail for me named Washramia, came and said that I must come with him to Atarsumba in Gaekwar's territory, as a Razmama had to ^be taken from me. When I arrived in Atarsumba I was taken to the Foujdar s Karkun, Krishna Dev, who said that mv statement had to be taken in Baroda, and that _ l must go there on that account! The Vahivatdar, Desaibhai, was at that time sitting near. I was sent to Baroda and taken to the Foujdari. I was then taken to Chabutra for 3 days. On the 4th day I was called to the Foujdari.

Deposition of Tisla Govinda, Chamar, father of Natiiuva Tisla, dated 13th August 1873. On the 25th February 1873 a fair was held at the Mahadev's temple near Atarsumba on account of Shivratre festival. The Vahivatdar and Foujdar of Atarsumba, with the sowars, &amp;c., of the Thana, went there to preserve the peace. As we had the right of taking away the skins of cattle dying in the Atarsumba villages of Wagjipur, Bobhu, and Fuljinu Muvadu, we are liable, agreeably to cus tom, to be called upon to perform ' Veth'* for Atarsumba. So my son Nathuva, Chamdio, Walio, Bulvantio, and Dylo went with bundles of grass to the fair. The three latter returned to Punadra, and told me that my son had been taken away to Punadra on the charge of defiling the temple. The next day I went to Atarsumba. The peons would not allow me to see my son who was thrown into prison and put in irons. I then saw the Vahivatdars, Valabhbhai, Jivabhai, and Desaibhai, and asked them why my son had been confined. They replied that he had defiled the temple, and that if I paid a fine of Rs. 1,000 he would be released, otherwise that he would be sent to Baroda. I said that I could not get Rs. 1 ,006 and returned home. At this time Haribhai, mukhi of Fuljinu Muvada, and sepoy Kamu Galubhai of the same village, were present. In the limits of Atarsumba I spoke to the Foujdar, whose name I do not know, about my son's release; he said that he would speak to the Vahivatdar about it. I then returned home. Three days subsequently I again went to Atarsumba, accompanied by the said sepoy and mukhi, and spoke to the Vahivatdar. He then demanded Rs. 400. I did not consent to pay the sum and returned home. Again I went to Atarsumba with the people above named, and spoke to Jivabhai, who desired me to go to Wagjipura with him, which I did. There he said that if I paid him Rs. 100 for self aad Rs. 50 for the Foujdar and Rs. 60 for Desai bhai, he would release my son; he then left for Devkaran Muvada, telling me that I should bring the Rs. 100 intended for him there. I and my companions return ed to Punadra and borrowed Rs. 100 from Bania Raochand Mangal at 1 per cent, (per month) interest and passed a bond to him. 1 then went to Devkaran Muva- Rs. 1001 &gt; Jivabhai. c ' a ' accom P an ied by the said Mukhi and Sepoy, and, taking Samlo and Lalio of my caste with us, I paid in their presenceRs. 100 to Jivabhai in the village Choura. The next day I again went to Rs. Co to Desaibhai. Atarsumba with Rs. 110 from my house, and paid Rs. 60 to Desaibhai at the house of Bania Tribhovan, of the village, in the presence of the latter, and Chamadia Walio, Balvanta, and Dyla of Rs. 50 to Foujdar's Karkun. Punadra, and the said Mukhi and sepoy, and also paid _ Rs. 50 to Krishna Deo, Karkun under the Foujdar in the taisumba ivacheri, through Kamu and the Mukhi. At that time Chamadia, feomia of Bhutesari, under Sadra, was present. Of this sum of Rs, 50, Rs. 2 were re turned as bad coin. The fetters were removed from my son's legs and he was brought to the kachen, and I was desired to procure bail for him ; he said that when the II ou J dar came a rajinama would be recorded. Chamadia Visramia, of Atarsumba, Arrest in Main Kanta limits f 00d ba il for ^. son ' and Krishnarao allowed my son as in Bapu Cursetji's ease. to go. He remained at home for 1-| months. The , security having then come to call my son, I and he went to Atarsumoa, when Krishna Dev, the Foujdar's karkun, handcuffed my son and sent him to Baroda. I asked why he was sent to Baroda, when I * Forced labour.Qj ' been made to pay money for his release. I was told that lie would give liis deposi tion at Baroda and return home. I then returned to my house. As my son did not return for 10 days, I went to Jivabhai at Atarsumba, when he told me to come to Baroda, where he himself was going the next day, and that he would procure my son's release. I came to 'Baroda and stayed there 10 days, but could not find Jivabhai, nor could I obtain any clue as to my son. So I left Baroda for my village and got down at the Nariad Nai jad, in British territory. Railway Station. I saw Jivabhai there and related to him what had happened; he said that if I want ed to have my son released, I should give a further sum of Rs. 300; as it was a Gaekwari concern, that further sum will be required. On this I paid him Rs. 20 which T had with me for current expenses, and got Ohamadia Mulia, of Nariad, to promise to Jivabhai to pay the remaining sum of Rs, 280. As Jiva bhai had no confidence in Mulia, the latter gave as security a Patidar of Nariad, whose name I do not know. In this way I arranged to have Rs. 300 paid to Jivabhai and returned home. I waited for 3 months, but Jivabhai did n ot procure at &gt; on p.i, - d oaa Iri y son's release and misappropriated themonev;* *Rs. 20 of the Rs. 300. , -i' n t n i • -i . ^ t-» • -i , tneretore 1 have complained to the Resident. Dated ISth August 1873.' 5. This evidence is supported by four Mahikanta subjects with regard to the bribery of the Vahivatdars and other points. It is unnecessary to quote it here. 6. With regard to the allegations of the Durbar as set forth in (c) and (/) above, the following are true copies of Resident's yads 1686 and 1704 therein referred to, from which it will be seen on what grounds the Resident required the release of a Mahikanta subject who had in reality been punished for his alleged crime of defiling the temple by a fine of Ra. 200 imposed by the Atarsamba Vahivatdars, Desaibhai and others, who, not wishing to credit that amount to the State, took illegal bail from a Mahikanta subject, and subsequently, instead of obtaining his extradition in the usual way, had him brought from Mahikanta territory by a Baroda subject and thrown into the Baroda jail, the whole proceeding being utterly illegal and contrary to treaty. 7. The Resident's letters are as follows :— ' Translation of Yad to Durbar No. 1686, dated 26th July 1873. Your Highness, I beg herewith to forward the petition of Chamar Tisla Grovinda, of Punadra, in the Mahikanta, presented this day, from which you will see that Nathuva, the son of the petitioner, went with a bundle as ' Begari' on the occasion of the last Shivratri fair at the temple of Antkant Mahadeo, in the month of Magh last; he was charged by the Vahivatdar of Atarsumba with the offence of having entered the temple, and was much beaten and imprisoned. The Vahivatdar demanded Rs. 200 for his release from the petitioner,* which the Ftz., Nathuva s fat er. latter paid and procured Nafchuva's release. Some months subsequently, Nathuva was sent for by the Foujclar of Atarsumba and for warded to Baroda. A sum of Rs. 300 was again demanded from him (petitioner). Of this he paid Rs, 200 and gave security for the remainder, but the boy is no where to be found at Baroda, and the petitioner prays for his release. Your Highness will learn these circumstances from the petition. tioner and his v Kindly have the abOTeTrr 0 ' 13 ' 11 '' 8 assertl0n in matter enquired into soon and let me know the result. The accompaniment to be returned. Dated 26th July 1873. P.S.-—The petitioner's son, who is in confinement, may be sent here the day after to-morrow, and the petition to be also returned.—Dated as above.' i—5 b6 Translation of Yad to Durbar, No. 1704, dated 28t]i July 1873. ' I have sent to the Durbar, yad No. 1686, dated the 26th July 1873, re questing that Nathuva, Chamar of the village of Punadra, in the Mahikanta, who has been imprisoned by the Vahivatdar of Atarsnmba, may be sent up to the Residency. The said Nathuva's father, Tisla Govinda, appeared before me this day and represented as follows :— ' My son was without reason charged by the Vahivatdar of Atarsumba with having entered the temple of Mahadev about 5 months ago; he was beaten and imprisoned. Subsequently, Yahivatdar Yalabhbhai, &amp;c., residents of Petlad, who had farmed the Atarsumba Mahal, demanded from me Rs. 200 for the boy's release. I gave the amount, having sold my cattle and borrowed the remainder from a Bania and from some people of my caste. The boy was then released and returned home. Some days subsequently the boy and again imprisoned and taken toBaroda. The Yahivatdar, &amp;c., then entered into a negociation with regard to this matter and demanded a further sum of Rs. 300 ; a part payment of Rs. 20 was made to him at Nariad, and security was given for the remainder. Still the boy has not been released from imprisonment. Of the sum of Rs. 200 first paid, only Rs. 8 appear in the G-overnment Records.' When this statement was made by the petitioner, the minister, Sivajirao Khan- velkar was present. The action of the Yahivatdar in having received money from a person of the petitioner's position is a (great) piece of injustice, and should be fully enquired into. I have said so to the minister. The prisoner is a subject of the Mahikanta, and it appears that he is undergoing sentence for having entered a temple; it is necessary for me to see what sentence he has received, because I find as follows on a reference to the Government order JSTo. 3900, dated 18th September 1849, with regard to accused persons belonging to the Mulukgiri Districts : — Is^. If an Agency subject commits an offence in the G-aekwar limits and a demand is made (for his surrender), a pr case should be submitted, and the Resident should be satisfied with it. 2nd. The surrender will be made if the Gaekwar Government award sen tence agreeably to the laws of the British Government. 3rd When a sentence is passed, it is to be carried into effect after the Resi dent has seen all the papers of the case and approves of the sentence. Under these circumstances, it was advisable, if the accused was to be im prisoned, that a, prima facie case should first have been submitted. This was not done, nor was any intimation given to me or the Political Agent, Mahikanta, as it was necessary to do. What is the reason of this ? If the man has been sen tenced, all the papers in his case may he so that they may be looked into (or an enquiry made). Dated 28th July 1873. These reasonable requests were never complied with; in fact there were no proceedings, it is believed, 8. The original seizure of Nathuva Tisla (a Mahikanta subject) in order to extort money, the bribe of Rs. 200, the release on bail, the re-arrest in Mahikanta limits, the imprisonment without enquiry or trial, and the present reply of the Durbar, are points which would have been established had the personal presence of Nathuva Tisla not been considered essentially necessary by the Commission. A reference has been made to Major LeGeyt, the Political Agent, Mahikanta, to enquire whether Nathuva Tisla is really in the dangerous state described, but as yet no reply has been received. 9. It is important also to record here what was brought to notice in one of the accompaniments to the Administration Report for 1872-73, viz., that the Yahivatdar Yalabhbhai, who is said to have demanded this bribe, farmed the7 Atarsumba Mahal, with 3 others, named Jivabhai, Desaibhai, and Nathubhai, all of whom appear to have exercised jurisdiction in the Mahal, and to have set aside the original Survey assessment, and levied a considerable amount in excess of it. This affords an exemplification of what was stated in the final remarks upon the case of Dalpat Prema, Schedule L, Case 3. 10. In addition to the above represented, bringing to notice the corrupt practices of the officials of the Atarsumba Mahal. No reply has been vouchsafed, and the Resident is not aware of any energetic measures having been adopted to put a stop to them. Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that justice has up to the present moment miscarried in the case under report,SCHEDULE I. C ase N o. 9. Maneklal Vithal, Soni, 22 years, goldsmith of Ahmedabad, states :—I have three houseSj two in Ahmedabad and one here. IVEy father lived here, and was employed by Government as a Soni on Rs. 12^ a month. Ke died here some 18 years ago, and on his death my mother, who was a native of Ahmedabad, took me, then a boy of 5 years or so, there with her. 1 lived continuously in Ahmedabad for some 10 years, learning my work and being educated. I then began to come here for one or two months each year, as occasion required, to sell the results of my work. I did no Government service here. I have a cousin, Amratlal, who lives in Baroda, Last I had a quarrel with him in Ahmedabad about a silver ornament, which he charged my brother with stealing. My bro ther was taken into custody by the Police, but was released. In the month of XpST I was here, and Amratlal got up a false complaint about me, that I had written a letter to my brother in Ahmedabad, to the effect that Amratlal's daugh ter, Ganga, had gone to the Maharaj, and that in consequence of this letter, he (Arnratlal) would be turned out of caste. He brought some 10 or 12 witnesses to prove his case. No depositions were taken in my presence. What happened to me after my arrest was that I was asked whether I had written this letter about my uncle and Ganga. I denied having done so, and was then remanded to custody for 4or 5 days, at the end of which time I was again called up before Eshvantrao, and told to show my handwriting. I did this and was again taken to the Chabutra. Thence, in a few days, I was taken to the jail, and was there told by Eshvantrao Foujdar, that I was sentenced to 14 years'imprisonment for writing this letter about my uncle and Ganga. My mother made 4 or 5 petitions to the Gaekwar's Government, but was not allowed to see me. She then complained to the Resident, who asked her to bring a certificate that she was a British subject. She brought such a certificate from the Collector of Ahmedabad, and after 4 or 4^ months in jail, I was released at the instance of the Resident. I was ordered by him to give security to be present when called upon. I declare distinctly that I never wrote the letter which I was accused of doing. The Durbar Agents reserve crossrexamination. Note.—The original proceedings of the deponent's trial and other papers have been produced before the Commission by the Resident; and it being stated that the signature, on his confession, which forms part of these proceedings, is a forgery, the witness is shewn two documents, both purporting to be signed by him, one being his alleged confession, the other a paper about his alleged domicile. He denied at first that either of them was his, but subsequently stated that the signature on the paper relating to his domicile is his, but that the one on his alleged confession is not his. Statement of the Durbar. Complainant is a Gaekwari subject, as we can prove from the census papers of 1872, from his having paid house assessment in 1869, and from the evidence of similar witnesses to those whom he proposes to call to shew that he is a British subject. The depositions were taken in his presence, as the proceedings themselves will shew. The signature he denies is his, as we can prove by evidence, and by the comparison of writing by him. The signature which he says was taken from him against his will, was made voluntarily by him.2 The sentence passed upon him was one year's imprisonment, not fourteen, and in addition to this he was called on to find security for Rs. 200, not to repeat his offence. Final Statement by the Resident. The case of Manekla] Vithal was entered in Schedule I. on the ground that in the opinion of the Resident, it was distinctly proved that Maneklal Vithal was a British subject. The grounds of the Resident's opinion on this subject are as follows : — 1. That Maneklal is at the present time a permanent resident of Ahmedabad, carrying on business there, and owning house property in Ahmedabad. 2. That Maneklal has lived all his life in Ahmedabad, and has never lived in Baroda except for short intervals, when he has come to Baroda for business. 3. That although he possesses a house in Baroda, he does not reside in it, but lets it for hire. The truth of these facts has never been denied, but it has been urged by the .Durbar that Maneklal possesses house property in Baroda, and has paid house assessment first in 1869, and has been entered in the Baroda census returns as a Baroda subject. On these slight grounds it has been contended by the Durbar that Maneklal Vithal is not a British but a Baroda subject. It has been decided by the Commission that Maneklal Vithal is not entitled to the privileges and protection of a British subject. Considering the evidence which the Resident was prepared to bring forward had he been allowed by the Commission to do so, and the fact that, agreeably to para. 7 of Commission's letter of November 1st, the Resident was empowered to decide authoritatively who were entitled to the protection of British subjects, the Resident is unable to account for the decision which has been arrived at, and he ventures most respect fully to submit that if the decision in this case be upheld, it will be impossible in practice to decide who are and who are not entitled to be considered as British subjects. The Resident would therefore respectfully solicit that the decision on this point may be reconsidered, because, in consequence thereof, the petitioner has been again consigned to the Baroda jail, upon a charge which the Resident believes to have been wholly without foundation. Whether Maneklal Vithal be or be not a British subject, the merits of his case are entirely unaffected. He was convicted in Baroda of the alleged offence of writing a defamatory letter to his brother in Ahmedabad, and the proceed ings of his trial have been produced. It is most significant that there is in these proceedings no evidence against Maneklal himself, except what purports to be his own confession. The genuineness of his confession is denied by Maneklal, who states that he never made it, and that the signature of his name is a forgery. Maneklal further states that he never wrote any letter at all to his brother in Ahmedabad, and his brother Nanji denies having received any such letter, and was prepared to have given evidence to this effect before the Commission. Taking into consideration the numerous cases of alleged false confession and false statements emanating from the Durbar, which it has been the Resident's duty to bring to the notice of the Commission, the Resident respectfully submits that the mere submission of proceedings by the Durbar cannot be accepted as even prima facie proof of the regularity of Durbar judicial proceedings. The petitioner in th's case appears to have been treated with extreme injustice, and it is respectfully submitted that whether he be a Baroda or a British subject, he is entitled to the protection of the British Government against the oppressive action of the Durbar Court. The Resident would therefore respectfully recommend, that whether the petitioner be or be not entitled to damages, the Durbar be at once advised to release him from confinement or to allow him to return without further molesta tion to Ahmedabad.SCHEDULE 1. C ase N o. 10. Parbhudas Parshotam Bliarut, 22 years, money-lender of Keriad, in Kaira Zillah, states : About 6 months ago, I went to the village of Jagral, in the Patan Mahal, to visit my uncle. When I had been there for 4 or 5 months, I was one day seized by the Foujdar Fatteh Ram and taken to the Waghrol thana on a charge of theft. I was there tied up with my hands behind my back, and my toes just touching the ground, and told to confess, by one Raghunath, Karkun. I was tied up that day, morning and evening. I was not beaten the first time, but in the evening I was struck 4 times with a tamarind stick over the body. 1 began to cry out, and grew faint, so that they released me, and said I might go home. My uncle made a petition about this, mentioning my name. Enquiry has been made into the matter by the Durbar. All that I want now is leave to go home if justice is done to me. 1 have not as yet had my deposition taken in Baroda. The Durbar Agents state that they have made a preliminary enquiry into the case, that they consider it proved against the Foujdar, and as soon as his deposi tion is verified; he can have leave to go. Final Statement by the Resident. This man is one of those who was flogged in the Patan District, (Schedule II., Cases 9 and 10), in order to make him confess to having committed a crime of which he was guiltless. The Durbar gave him Rupees 28 in compensation, and he returned to Neriad. The Foujdar who committed the crime has been punished. The case affords, with others that have been brought to light during the present proceedings, proof of the system of torture to obtain confessions which is practised by the Gaekwar Government, a system which renders the alleged confessions of accused persons utterly valueless, as evidence of guilt. The notorious flogging case of 8 persons, (No. 39 of Schedule II.), affords a notable example of this, one man having died under this system, and two being now in prison for life, solely on the grounds of their confession obtained by flogging. i—10SCHEDULE I. C ase N o. 12. I. Aaraiigi Vitlioba, 30 years, of Klianval, in Eatnagiri District, states :— My husband is now alive. I came hither to Baroda of my own pleasure some 2^- years ago, brought by Babaji Bidkar, a servant of Nana Sahib, and went to Nana Sahib to be his mistress. Thence I went to the palace, taken there by Nana bahib himself, at that time also of my own accord and free will. In the palace I found I had to do service to the Queen, fanning her, and performing other duties of a servant. This s-ervice was rendered against my will. I remained as a ser vant 4 or 5 months in the palace. I was then questioned by the Maharaj as to whether I knew anything of any intrigue between the Raholkar and the Rani. 1 said I knew nothing of it, and was then put into the Chabutra, where I re mained for 11 months.- I was at the end of that time remanded to the jail, where I stayed for 1|- years. While in jail I was twice flogged by Bhojangrao, receiving 4 cuts with a cane on the back, the cause being that I had eaten 2| paisas' worth of bajri which I had ground. I was released at the last eclipse of the moon. When I was brought up first there were 4 or 5 other women brought up with me by Babaji Bidkar. I twice saw women caned by Bhojangrao, while I was in jail. I was fully and entirely released, not being told to go back to service. I have lived since my release by labour, grinding corn, &amp;c. No one will take me back to the Konkan. I should be glad to go back to my husband, but he would not take me. The Durbar Agents decline to cross-examine and postpone their reply. Reply of the Durbar. It is found on enquiry that she was not brought by Nana Sahib or his depen dents. She came to Baroda of her own accord in search of employ, having quarrelled with her husband. She applied to Nana Sahib for employment, and was engaged for service at the Vada, where she received food and clothing, and was otherwise well treated. While in service she was guilty of the theft of silver boxes, &amp;c., from the Jamankhana, and as a punishment removed to jail. She was released at the last eclipse of the moon as a special act of clemency. No com plaint of her being flogged in jail was ever made by her. She was allowed the rations granted to prisoners. 1 — 12SCHEDULE I. C ase 13. Salu, wife of Gbanu, resident of Sakarpa, in tlie Ratnagiri District, states:— I was brought hither along with some four other Ratnagiri women about 2 years ago, by three of Nana Sahib Khanvelkar's people, viz., Sagona, Gropal Siroba, and liambhao. I came of my own accord, and with my own inclination with these men. I left my mother's house on the promise of getting Rs. 200 worth of jewels and clothes. I do not know why I was to get these fine things. I, on arrival in Baroda, went to Nana Sahib's house, where I remained for a month as his wife. The child I now have in my arms is his. I was then taken into the palace to be a ' Loundi' against my will, by Nana Sahib himself. I served in the palace for five months, when the M aharaj sent for me and asked if I knew anything about Balvantrao Raholkar and the Queen, and on my pleading entire ignorance, I was taken to the Chabutra, where I stayed for 1 l r months, and was then taken to jail, where was confined for years. No cause was assigned for imprisoning me. While I was in jail, I was once flogged with 4 cuts from a cane by Bhojangrao, because the bajri I was grinding was found to be coarse. I have twice or thrice seen other women beaten while I was in jail. I was released without conditions, and was not told to return to service. I would be glad to go back to my house, but no one would take me. I have lived since my release by grinding corn, daily labour, &amp;c. The Durbar Agents decline to cross-examine, and state they will be ready with a reply. Reply of the Durbar, The same as in previous case with this addition, that she was allowed milk and extra rations while in jail, in consequence of her having given birth to a child while imprisoned. i —13—— — li I ' ■ I ■ ' -T.r i „ - ■ - '11 D epositions of S aedaes and M ilitary C lasses. 1-—E shvantrao M ahipateao , of B aroda ; —I have one village, Kaotao, in equal shares with Narsingrao Bhivrao ; value Rs. 2,500 or thereabouts. In addi tion to this I ought to get Es. 24,000 annually for the support of my establish- r , sowars, horses, palkis, &amp;c. Narsingrao has no share in the Rs. 24,000. 1 li i ± the feardars in my line was Narayenji my grandfather. I cannot nx the date ot his first employment by word of mouth. I have no records in my possession to show my title. I have received payment of my Rs. 24,000 in full up to date, but I cannot say on what day I received it. I have no complaint to make now against the Gaekwar's Government. There are two years' payment of my 'Tainat in arrears, and the third year is now in progress. There is no fixed date for payment. It rests with the Government to fix the date of payment. My elder brother, Maluji, died in San vat 1912 ( a.d . 1855) or thereabouts. He had an allowance of Rs. 1,500 for himself, which Ganpatrao Gaekwar stopped in Sanvat 1902 ( a.d . 1852). This allowance I claim. The reason of my Rs. 24,000 being in arrears is, that, notwithstanding the promises of the late Gaekwar at the time of the mutiny not to reduce the esta blishment of Silledars, he did reduce those of smaller Sardars, and I, to support these men, refused to take my money unless he kept all the establishments up in full. The assurance of the Gaekwar was only verbal; and this assurance I conveyed to the smaller Silledars. Cross-examined by Agent R ao S aheb B apubhai , ;—Out of the sum of Rs. 24,000 mentioned above is an item of Rs. 750 monthly, the pay of the sowars of my portion of the contingent. This sum has been paid to them every month. The Gaekwar may have reduced the establishment and allowance of the Sardars. I do not know for certain. 2.— N arsingrao R aoji B hivrao , of B aroda , states :— I have a village, by name Kaotao, in equal shares with Eshvantrao, and besides this Rs. 26,000 annu- ally for the support of my sowars, horses, servants, &amp;c. This is distinct from that of Eshvantrao. My establishment dates from the time of ray great-grand father Narayenji Raoji. I cannot state from what year it dates. I am now in arrears for the two last years, and the third year is now going on. In the year of the Mutiny an order came to us and the other Sardars to go to the village of Kapura. The Sardars said they had heard they were to be reduced, and the Gaekwar Government gave a verbal assurance to all the Pandra family that the lesser Sardars would not be reduced. I myself helped to assure these lesser Sardars. I am 25 or 30 years old. I refused to take my money from the Government on the report that these Sardars were to be reduced. I do not know whether or not any have been actually reduced. I have no personal complaint or quarrel now against the Government. In answer to G abkwar's Agent: —My contingent sowars have had their monthly pay of Rs. 957 regularly given to them. I have no written records in my possession, 3.—Narayenji Raoji Jagdevrao , of Baroda , states:— I have one Inam vil lage, Ajor—Rs. 1,200. There are no co-sharers. I have also annual allowances of Rs. 26,000 for the support of my Paga, &amp;c. It dates from the time of Damaji- rao Gaekwar, but I cannot say the year. I have not received my emoluments for the last two years. The third year is now in progress. Out of the Rs. 26,000, I have received Rs. 983-8-0 monthly for the pay of my contingent sowars. The reason of my refusing to take the balance of my allowances is, that in the year of the mutiny the Maharaj told the Sardars to go to Kapura. He came there himself with his Karbharis, &amp;c'., and the Sardars refusing to march, as they heard that they were to be reduced, the Maharaj himself told us to assure the lesser men that they would not be reduced. This assurance I personally in company with the rest of the Pandare Bhaoband gave to the Silledars. The Maharaj12 himself asked me to take my pay, but I refused to do so for the sake of the lesser Sardars. I do not know whether any Sardars have or have not been actually reduced. About five or six months ago some of these people came and told me that their allowances were diminished. My pay has been in arrears for two or three years, according to custom ; but it is only within the last six months that 1 refused to take it. I have no personal complaint or cause of quarrel with the (raekwar now. I have no knowledge of any written Sanad or papers. My Sanad is long prescription, i .e., enjoyment of the allowances in question. I consider them my Watan. There are many Silledars, but I cannot state their names. 4 — M ahadaveao L ohajirao of B aroda , states ; I am of the Pandare family. I have one village, Lilaipur—Rs. 600, and an annual allowance ot Rs. 16,500 or thereabouts. My occupation dates from the time of iJamaji. Besides this my father had an allowance of Es. 6,000, which was reduced on his death in Sanvat 1923 ( a.d . 1866) by Khanderao. There are now two years ot my pay in arrears, and the third yearis now in progress. In the year ot the mutiny Khanderao Maharaj came in person to Kapura, and assured us verbally that the lesser Sardars would not be reduced. This assurance I myself helped to convey to the lesser Sardars. I have no personal quarrel or cause of complaint against the Gaekwar. It is merely for the sake of these people that I refuse my pay. I do not know whether any of them have been reduced or not. People come to me to complain that they are reduced ; but I cannot name them, they are so numerous. I have no Sanad in my possession except my sword. I have received Rs 600 monthly for my contingent sowars' pay out of the Rs. 16,500. It is about four months ago since I refused to take my pay. In answer to G abkwar's Agent : — I conveyed the late Gaekwar s assurance to all the lesser Sardars and Silledars, but cannot name any of them. 5. — A mratrao L imbajirao P andare , of B aroda , states ; I have no village in Inam. I have an annual allowance of Rs. 18,325 for sowars, horses, palkis, &amp;c. I hold it from the time of Damajirao Gaekwar. I have not received my pay for the last two years, and the third year is now in progress. I have received Rs. 7,000 an nually out of my allowance for the pay of my contingent sowars. In the year 1857-58, the Mutiny year, Khanderao Maharaj himself came to Kapura, and told us, the Pandare family, to assure the lesser Sardars that they would not be reduced. This assurance we gave. I do not know if this assurance has been broken. The Government knows. Some people—I cannot say how many, or who they were— came to me some twelve months ago, and told me their allowances were reduced. It was for this reason I refused to take my pay. This was some twelve months ago. My only Sanad is my long occupancy and tenure. I have no written documents. I have no private complaint or grievance against the Gaekwar's Government. The Gaekwar's Agents decline to cross-examine. 6. — N arayenrao R aja L akshmanrao G horpadb , of B aroda , states :— I have now no villages, and my total present allowance from the State is Rs. 25,000 annually. The origin of my establishment is lost in obscurity. My father died in Sanvat 1905 ( a.d . 1848), and I was then at Mudhol, in the Belgam District. The whole was attached by Ganpatrao Maharaj. I returned in Sanvat 1911 ( a.d . 1854) and in Sanvat 1918 ( a.d . 1861) I got Rs. 25,000 back. The reason of confiscating the balance of my allowance was the Gaekwar's pleasure. The present allowance is for the pay of my horses, paga, and general establishment. There are two years pay in arrears, but the sowars of the contingent included in my Tahinat have received monthly their pay of some Rs. 1,700. I refused to take my pay because the Pandare people refused to do so, and because others did so. I cannot say who they were. I have no personal complaint or suit against the Gaekwar. I have no complaint about the amount by which my allowance was lessened. I may have proof of my claims, but I do not know where it may be. The Gaekwar's Agents decline to cross-examine.7. Nawab Sahib Mm Kamaludiis' Husein Khan, of Baroda, states:— I have five villages Inam, and Es. 96,000 allowance annually from the Gaekwar's Government. Ihis dates from 80 years back, and was given to my grandfather Mir Nasrudin Husein by the Maharaja Govindrao, and has since been in the continuous enjoyment oi my family. The allowance is for the pay of my establish ment of sowars keep of horses and servants, &amp;c. The pay of the sowars is about 48,000 annually, and this has been received punctually by them every month. Out of this 27,000 goes monthly to the contingent sowars. The rest is for private sowars. I have received my pay up to Sanvat 1927 (a.d. 1870) and the third year of arrears is now current. I have refused to take my pay on three grounds : 1^.—Because in Sanvat 1915 (a.d. 1858) the Maharaj Khanderaoand others came to Kapura where all the Sarclars were assembled at the camp of the Pandare Sardars. I was very young at that time, and my uncle Seiad Hamid-ula was my guardian. The Sardars represented that their arms, &amp;c., were old and useless, and that without good arms they could not fight. The Maharaj told us that we might keep all the Go vernment weapons we had and go to battle. The smaller Sardars re quested us to ask the Maharaj to assure them that they would not be reduced. The Maharaj promised us to do so, and on his word we as sured the lesser Silledars. The matter then rested, but in last Posh (January) some of the Silledars and Sardars came to me and informed me they had been reduced. In consequence of this, I, the Pandare, and other great Sardars consulted as to what we should do. We ar ranged to inform the Maharaj of our grievance, and all went to the Commander-in-Chief, Bapu Sahib. He is not now present. He told us to inform the Dewan Sahib, Sivajirao Khanvelker, who told us the Maharaj was making reductions. We then in a body gave a written petition to the Maharaj himself, which we all signed. The Maharaj said he would clear up matters. We then went to the Resident and told him our tale. The Maharaj was persuaded by the Resident or somehow induced to give orders for the payment in lull of those who had no complaints : he settled some of the complaints, and some remain ed over. He also directed that the lesser Silledars should be re duced. Those who have complaints have not been settled with as yet, but a promise has been made to enquire into their grievances. Neither we nor the Pandare people nor other great Sardars got our grievances settled at that time. We are now having our grievances enquired into by the Maharaj. The 2nd grievance is that the Saoli pargana belonging to me, and two Duma- la villages in the Vagodhipargana, and one in the Baroda pargana are un der attachment. We are now begging the Maharaj to remove the attach ment. The attachment has lasted for four or five years, and has been on account of my quarrel with the late Bhao Sindia. The late Gaekwar, Khanderao, gave a verbal order before his death to have the attachment raised, but died before it was done. I then petitioned Malharrao, and he ordered enquiry to be made. In the last two or three months he has been promising to have it removed, but he has not done so yet. In the matter of the Saoli pargana, I have a Sanad from Seiaji Maharaj, which I now produce before the Commissioners. The date of this is about 1833-35, and I consider that it conveys to me the .Saoli pargana in perpetuity free of service. The pargana was attached in Sanvat 1925 (a.d. 1868). There are 20 or 22 villages in it. The Gaekwar daily promises enquiry into the matter. The pargana was attached for the same reason as the villages named above, and Khanderao before his death gave verbal orders for the raising of the attachment. He died before his orders could be carried out. d—1 13I had a third grievance about two sums of Hs. 10,000 and Rs. 3,000, but they are settled now and I have no grievance remaining about them. Cross-examined hy Gaekwar's Agent: —The Silledars were servants, old servants of the Gaekwar. I do not know if any of the Silledars were actually reduced or not. The Gaekwar's Agents admit the genuineness of the signatures and. seal of the Sanad on Haghunath Pandurang Kamdar, stating that they are genuine. Answer of the Durbar to Sardar Nawab Sahib Kamaludin (Statement No. 1st —The Sanad is not a sanad but an annual lease or farm contract and mentions the sum for which the lease or farm was granted, and the disbursements to be made were entered therein ; similar documents were passed in previous years for certain periods from time to time. On the resumption of Saoli pargana the Nawab received Rs. 10,000 annually, not as of right, but as an exercise of favour by the Gaekwar. 2nd. —The Dumala villages were not Inam, but Government granted to him in lieu of a portion of an annual allowance assigned for Sardar's service. Their proceeds were subject to an annual adjustment between him and the Durbar. If the proceeds exceeded the value of the amount they represented, the excess was recovered by a corresponding reduction in the rest of the cash allowances. 3rd. —As to the assurance given at Kapura by Khanderao, the Durbar has no knowledge of the alleged assurance conveyed by him to the lesser Sardars. Had such been given, there would have been a record of it, which is not the case. The original Sanad acknowledged to be genuine of a.d . 1818, together with the subsequent one of a.d . 1833-5, having been placed before the Commission and read by them, seemed, so far as they were able to judge, to bear out generally the statement of the Durbar. 8. Mir Ibrahim Ali Mir Akbar Alikhan , of Baroda , states :— I have an Inam village Gotia—Rs. 14,000 or 15,000. It was first conferred on my grand father on the recommendation of the English Government. The name of my grandfather was Mir Sarfaraz Ali Khan. I cannot tell in what year, but it was in the time of Anandrao Gaekwar. My former allowances from the Gaekwar's Government amounted to Rs. 32,000 or thereabouts. Out of this there was a monthly sum of Rs. 800 or thereabouts for the pay of sowars now belonging to the contingent. They have been in the contingent for the last 10 years. Before this they were Silledar sowars under me. These sowars have received their pay monthly up to date. The balance of the Rs. 32,000 was for the support of my establishment, and for my service. Of the balance of the Rs. 32,000 I have only, since 1863, received a sum of Rs. 15,000 for the expenses of my marriage. 1 have heard that the balance has been paid annually by the Gaekwar's Government to a Sahukar, but I have received none myself, and I have never given any receipt for the money. The reason of the balance of the allowance being paid as above was that my father having died during the lifetime of my grandfather, my uncle, Mir Jafir Ali, conducted my affairs as my guardian for one year. At the expiry of that time the Gaekwar, Khanderao, transferred my ser vice, estates and rights to another uncle, Mir Bakr Ali. This was in 1860, and I was at that time a boy of 12 or 13 years of age. This arrangement lasted till 1862, when on my applica tion to Sir Bartle Frere and his recommendation of me to the Gaekwar, I was re-in- stated in my father's property, &amp;c., with additions of establishment which made up the whole to Rs. 40,000. The horses, elephants, &amp;c., however, remained with Mir Bakr Ali. Some six months after that a false telegram was sent to the Government that Mir Jafir Ali was going to England on behalf of Malharrao. Upon this Khunderao Maharaj summoned Mir Jafir Ali forthwith from Bombay. f 4 (l&lt;15 »7 / Mir Jafir Ali fell ill at Surat and at once Khunderao confiscated my two Jagir vil lages and all the establisliment as above belonging 1 to me, and transferred my sow ars who were at Amreli into the contingent. Two villages which had been bought tiom my private means were given over to Mir Bakr Ali. Mir Jafir Ali complain ed about this false telegram and the proceeding consequent thereupon to the Gov- emor in Bombay, the Gaekwar in Baroda and the Resident, but no encjuiry was instituted into the matter. The Gaekwar sent a copy of what he had done to Mil •lafh Ali in Surat, who protested against it, and promised to attend at Baioda as soon as he was sufficiently well to do so j but he died. On his death 1863 Bakr Ali threatened and terrified his wife and my mother, and took ^ everything into his own possession, and there it remained till Khanderao s death two years ago. Since Malharrao's accession in 1872, the village of Gotia was restored to me but nothing else. For the last eight years I have been living on money borrowed from bankers, because my establishment and allow ances have been stopped. I represented to Malharrao two years ago, that 1 have suffered loss-to the extent of a lakh of Rupees, but all that he has done for me is to restore my villaga of Gotia. I am now one lakh in debt, and I have also sold family jewels to the value of another lakh, and with the money so obtained I have kept myself alive. My present complaint against Malharrao is that he has not restored to me the establishment and emoluments of which I was depriv ed by Khanderao. All the sanads, papers, certificates and records relating to me and my property are in the possession of Mir Bakr Ali, who has left Surat and goes to Gwalior, Bombay, and other places. My grandfather gave security to Ganpatrao Maharaj, for the good conduct of the father of one Badhan Mia and Dosa Mia. These men have lately come to me, and begged that I should become responsible to the Gaekwar for them as my grandfather was before me. Cross-examined by the G abkwae's Agen — I have refused to take my chits for payment for the two years 1927 ( a.d . 1870) and 1928 ( a.d . 1871) because my establishment has been so reduoed. The reductions so made were my two vil lages, Mareli and Bameli (Jaghir), and Bs. 5,000 or Rs. 6,000 on account of sowars. Badhan Mia wanted my assurance that he should not be molested or hurt by the Gaekwar's Government in any way. I do not know if my grandfather gave any written security to Badhan Mia ; he did to the Gaekwar's Government, in the time of Ganpatrao Maharaj, but I do not know the year. I was to give as surance to the Government for Dosa Mia. The Pandare, Ghorpade, and other Sardars also gave security for him ; Dosa Mia was in jail two years ago, and our security was given to release him from custody. I petitioned the Durbar a few days ago about the Sindis. The Durbar replied asking in what way we were going to be security for them, and what our business was with them. We have not yet replied to this demand of the Durbars, because we have not hitherto had time to do so. The Durbar Agent desires to defer further examination of this witness till he has consulted with the Durbar. Mir Ibrahim Ali re-examined:—I have refused to take my allowances for the last ten years on the grounds, 1st, that my establishment and emoluments had been unjustly reduced and my villages attached ; Zncl, that lately we have heard that the Silledars, &amp;c., were to be reduced, so w T e greater Sardars determined to see if by being of one mind and representing our grievances to the Government wo could not obtain redress for all, and fearing also that we greater Sardars would meet with the same fate eventually as the smaller men. Note. —The deponent has given three conflicting statements in the foregoing deposition, the fact being that he had anything but a clear notion of what he was saying, and did not seem to know clearly what his establishment or reductions had been. Reply of the Durhar in S ardak's case No. 8, M ir I brahim A li—- The Durbar alleges Two years ago whatever property of his w f as in thepossession of the Durbar then, was handed back to him, and the property so re turned included some land belonging to Mir Bakr Ali. With regard to his establishment, &amp;c., the accounts of the Durbar show that the amount due, therefore, has been regularly disbursed to him or on his account, and that at the present time a balance of Rs. 200 is all that is due to him now. Whatever reductions have been made were made by the late Gaekwar because he considered the men reduced were not required. 9. D ost M ahammad Z amin M ia , now of B aroda , states :— I have at present two Inam villages, the income from which is Rs- 7,000 or 8,000. I also draw allowances of Rs. 67,000 annually from the Gaekwar's Government for the support of my establishment of sowars, servants, &amp;c. The first establishment was allowed by the Gaekwar 115 years ago to my great-grandfather, Hamid Jamadar. He was succeeded by my grandfather, Amin Sahib, who left at his death two legitimate and one illegitimate son. His property and establishment was divided into shares of 7 annas to my father, Zamin Mia, 7 annas to Haman Mia, the father of Radhan Mia, and 2 annas to the illeoitimate son Morad Ali. I am my father's sole heir, and succeeded him in 1912 ( a.d . 1855). I have a third village Saral, Rs. 5,000 revenue, which was attached by the late Gaekwar, Khanderao, in Sanvat 1925 ( a.d . 18 68), on the ground that it was a Government village, and not one of my Inami villages. It had then been over 100 years in the possession of my family. The Sanad showing my right is in the possession of Radhan Mia's mother. Radhan himself died a year ago. He held the sanad as he was the elder brother. The three villages above mentioned are held by the three brothers or their representatives in the proportions named before. I mentioned my grievance to Khanderao Maharaj, but have said nothing about it to the present Gaekwar, against whom my complaint is that he does not let me manage the Mahal of Kheiralu, the management of which has been for more than 100 years in the possession of my family. Khanderao took the management away and gave me Rs. 10,000 annually in cash instead. This allowance Malharrao refused to continue, but he has now consented to let me have it again. He has also dismissed 25 of my sowars, but has promised to restore them. I have another cause of complaint about a Dumala village, Kambale, revenue Rs. 5,000, which Khanderao Gaekwar confiscated as being a Government village. It had been ours for 80 years. We have no sanad that we know of for Kambale. The present Gaekwar, Malharrao, promises to enquire into this, and to restore the village. I made my grievance known to the Dewan, (Nana Sahib) of Malharrao Gaekvvar, and also to the Senapati, Bapu Sahib, as is the usual custom. If they do not listen to our complaints we apply to the Maharaj personally. Out of the Rs. 67,000 which I ought to receive, I have not received anything for two years ; the third year is now going on. I have refused to take my allowances on the same grounds that the Pandare, Ghorpade, and other Sardars have done. The orders have been issued for payment, but I have not taken my pay hitherto. The Gaekwar's Agent desires to postpone cross-examination till to-morrow. Reph] of the D urbar ;—The village of Saral was a Dumala village granted to him as part payment of his allowances, and when it was resumed we gave him Rs. 2,500 annually in cash instead. Similary with the pargana of Kheiralu, he only had the management of the pargana, and on that being taken away we gave him an allowance of Rs. 10,000 instead, as in the case of the Saoli pargana. Kambale was also a Dumala village which we resumed, and for which we gave an equivalent in cash. They were all taken up by Khanderao. 10: N arayenrao R amrao G uftr, R esident in B aroda , states :—-My father Kamrao was the first of our family who came to Baroda. He came with Govind- rao Maharaj. I have our Inam village Antroli, revenue Rs. 4,000, or thereabouts, 16 1 A ■f*- 1 4.which I hold in equal shares with my first cousin, Kasinath Narayenrao. I also have allowances of lis. 10,000 annually from the Gaekwar Government for the support of my establishment of sowars, &amp;c. This and all my other property I hold in equal shares with my aforesaid cousin, Kasinath. I formerly held five vil lages, a Jaghir of Rs. 20,000. Out of these, four villages were resumed from me 50 or 60 years ago. Ihe Gaekwar gave them and took them away again. I have no complaint to make about them. I have now no grievance whatsoever against the present Gaekwar as he has promised to keep up my 'nimnuk' establish ment on the scale maintained by the late Gaekwar. Some fifteen days ago I got all my arrears of pay for two years back. My grievance was that out of my Rs. 10,000 Malharrao stopped 8,000, but he has, as above said, given me chits for the total amount. .1 didnot join with the Pandare and other Sardars in refusing to take my pay. The Rs. 8,000 was stopped some six months ago. There was no reason assigned for doing this. It was the Sarkar's pleasure. The money and pagah (establishment of sowars) were not given away to any one. I got the order that they were dismissed. The Gaekwar's Agents decline to cross-examine. 11.— A bdul R ahman A bdulla, A bab of B aroda , states:—My father came from Arabia some eighty years ago, and entered the service of Fattehsinghrao Gaek war. Aboutthree years ago in Sanvatl926 ( a.d . 1869-70) on the accession of Malhar rao, all my establishment was dismissed. I had 100 sowers under me, and they were all dismissed ; I got Rs. 14,000 from the Government annually, 1,000 monthly for the sowars, and the balance for Palki and personal allowances ; I produce a Sanad given to me by Khanderao Gaekwar in Sanvat 1924 ( a.d . 1867-68) allowing me Rs. 100 a month as personal allowance for distinguished service in the Naikra outbreak that year in the Panch Mahals. The Sanad grants this allowance to me and my heirs in perpetuity. N.B. —(This Sanad is shown to Raghunath Pandurang Kamdar in the Farnavi's Office of the Gaekwar's establishment, on whose statement of its cor rectness the Gaekwar's Agents admit the signature and seal being genuine). Since then I have lived by borrowing money and any way I can. What choice have I ? I want to be restored to my former position. I have represented to the Dewan that I have been for forty-five years a Government servant and have done no man wrong or injury. He heard all I had to say. He sent me to Hariba Gaekwar, the Revenue Commissioner, who did nothing for me. I have no knowledge of the reason of my dismissal. I was suddenly informed of it and told to go. I had also a Karkhana of 10 foot soldiers at Kadi, and one and a half years ago they were also dismissed without cause assigned. The Gaekwar's Agents reserve cross-examination. Reply of theDarhar to the Statement A bdul R ahman, N o . 11;—The present Government having no confidence in him dispensed with his services. The complainant was not present when the defence was made, though he was on the 15th. The Durbar further states that the allegation made by Abdul Rahman that he had charge of horse under Fattehsing is untrue. He was made Jemadar of 100 foot in the time of Khanderao Gaekwar. 12. N arayknrao S hivrao G ovindrao, H arp ale of B aroda ;—The first of our family to come to Baroda was our grandfather Naoji about 100 years ago. I do not know who was the Gaekwar then. Our present a tahinat'' is Rs. 5,800 for sowars. We have no Inam villages, and are equal sharers in all our property. Formerly our emoluments were Rs. 36,000 in all, but that was all broken up more than seventy years ago, and we have no grievance on that subject. Since Sanvat 1928 (a.d. 1871) the present Gaekwar, Malharrao, and his commander of contin gent. Nana Sahib Khanvelkar, the Minister, have transferred 12 of our sowars into the contingent, leaving us with two only. Tbey have taken away the horses and all their furniture and have also stopped the pay. We do not get a ' paisa''18 of pay now nor have we since 1928 ( a.d . 1871). We have been deprived of our emoluments because we were suspected of helping Jamnabae, the Rani ot Khanderao, whose sister is the wife of me, Narayenrao. Our desire is to have our emoluments restored and to be assured of safety from future molestations. We have made petitions to the Dewan and the Commander-in-Chief, but no one listens to us. The only answer we get is 'you are dismissed.' We never had any Sanads beyond our long continued occupancy. The horses which were taken from us were our private property, bought with our own money. Cross-examination deferred till 15thinstant. R eply of the D urbar in the case op N arayenrao and S hivrao H arpale, No. 12 :—The statement is admitted to be correct generally. The Durbar hav ing no confidence in them dispensed with their services. If there is any pri vate property of theirs found to be in our possession, it will be restored after enquiiy. 13. A li M ahamad R aya A li of B aroda , states :— I was born in Baroda, but my father came to it about eighty years ago. My maternal grandfather Jemadar Shakar, was the first of my family here in the time of Anabarao. My present establishment has been abolished. I had 25 foot-men in the time of Khanderao Maharaj. He reduced 4 men. Nine months ago I got a verbal order from the Sebandi Commander that all my 21 men were transferred to the command ot Eshvantrao, one of the Gaekwar's personal followers. I petitioned the Commander in-Chief, the Dewan and others, but was only abused for my pains, and no one would listen to me. I have not received my pay for nine months. I want my establishment and position restored to me. There was no cause given for re moving these men beyond that it was the Sarkar's pleasure. The pay I got was Rs. 2,000 annually before any reductions took place. Cross-examined by G aekwar's Agents :— I have heard that Bshvantrao has been dismissed. I have not been told that chits have been made out for the pay. Xh#«Karkoon Babarao in the Commander-in-Chief s office did tell me my men were to be restored to me. I have not informed the Commander-in-Chief that my men have not been re-transferred to me. I never see him. His Karkuns conduct his business. My Karkun did read the list of men to be restored to me, but they were only names. I have*not seen the men. Re-called and re -examined : In the year Sanvat 1923 ( a.d . 1866) on the out break of Waghirs at Okamandal an additional levy of three hundred men was required to be raised, besides the previous regular Mahal establishment of two hundred men. Previous to this I had no concern with the latter establishment. The rate of pay of the new levy was Rs. 2 less than the customary rate of Rs. 10. No one would raise men at the lesser rate till I came forward. I brought 300 men, and the command of the whole force of 500 was given to me. When the outbreak was suppressed, the three hundred men were discharged, and 1 was deprived of the command of the 200 regulars about seven months after the present Maharaj's accession. The present commander is Sheikji Sahib, one ot Malharrao Gaekwar's personal followers. My complaint is that though I made this contract at a much lower rate than any one else and benefitted the Govern ment, I have been deprived of my service. When the levy was 500 strong, I got Rs. 175 pay, and when only 200 strong, I got Rs. 75 monthly. The Gaekwar's Agents decline to cross-examine. Reply of the Durbar :—The cause of the complaint as to the charge of his 21 foot being given to Eshvantrao has been removed, and as regards the transfer of the command of the 200 men in the Mahal from him to another man, we had a right to do so, as is shown by our previously having taken them from a former commander and handed them over to him. 14. G anpatrao or B alvantrao bin M adhavrao, D hamdere of B aroda , states:— My allowances are Rs. 45,200 annually for the pay of my establishment of Silledars, &amp;c. I have also one Inam village, Brahmangam, revenue Rs. 10,000, or thereabout. The first of my family was Ganpatrao, who came hither in the time19 / r of Anandrao Maharaj, about eighty years ago. I am his direct heir. On the death of Grirjajirao, my grandfather, in Sanvat 1918 ( a.d . 1861) my father's establishment was reduced to Rs. 34,915 by Ivhanderao Maharaj for no reason beyond that it was his own pleasure ; my father died killed by a boar in Sanvat 1928 (a.d. 1871) and the whole of my establishment was confiscated by Malharrao Maharaj for no fault or reason whatsoever. The Inam village also was confiscated. My complaint is that I have been deprived of everything I possess in the world, and ! want my estate, &amp;c., restored to me. The estate, &amp;e., was originally conferred for services rendered by my great-grar'd-father. I have a Sanad in my possession which I now produce for the Inam village. N.B. —The Sanad is acknowledged by the Gaekwar's Agents to be correct and genuine. It bestows the village of Brahmangam on Ganpatrao (the grand father of this witness) and his heirs for ever, in consideration of service rendered by him to the State. I hand in also a list of private property of which I have been deprived amounting to Rs. 2,02,289-8-0. I am an adopted son. The Gaekwar, Malharrao, consented to the adoption in the month of Sanvat 1928 ( a.d . 1871) Vaisakh (May). The order of consent was verbal, but there was a written order accepting my ser vice, I produce a copy of this, dated 19th October 1871. The original is in the possession of the Silledar Bakshi. (The Silledar Bakshi is present, and acknow ledges the correctness of the copy produced.) Cross-examined hy G aekwar's Agent: Mahadavrao, my own brother and immediate predecessor, was the adopted son of Girjajirao. I was adopted by my brother Mahadavrao's widow. The Agents of the Gaekwar reserve the rest of their cross-examination. The following genealogical table is produced by the witness :— Granpatrao, original grantee, dying childless, adopted Girjaji, who also dying childless, adopted Mahadavrao Dinkar. He being killed, his widow adopted his brother Ganpatrao Dinkar—the present claimant. Re-called : —On the death of Mahadavrao, my Vakil, Uma Kant Tatya, went up to Baroda by desire of the widow, and mentioned to Balvantrao Raholkar, the Gaekwar's Dewan, her wish to adopt the younger brother * L e. to complete the 0 f husband. The dewan gave him a verbal reply of offioial acknowledg- v we n tak e his service.' No ' poshak' was given at that men o leacop ion- ^ me Up the present timel have received no 'poshak.' The Dewan and officers of the Government have never come to our house to take pansopari. * All the official ceremonials about my adoption are in abeyance. B eply of the D urbar :—AVo state that M^ahadavrao on his death left one widow, and two wives of his father, one ot whom was his own mother. We do not recognize the present claimant as the heir at all. No adoption has been sanctioned or recognized by the Government. As there was a doubt as to the heir, the property was attached immediately on Mahadavrao s death, and until it has been decided who the heir is, the possession of the private property remains in abeyance. 14—A. B alvantrao B hikaji B ahurkar is called by Colonel I hayie on behalf of G anpatrao D amdere , and states :—I was the Naib Dewan of Malhar rao Gaekwar in 1870-71. A Karkun of the Damdere family, by name Tatya, reported the death of Madhavrao to the Gaekwar, and fifteen daj s afterwards this Tatya brought a boy to me, brother ot Mahadavrao, whom^ I took to the Maharaj and presented as the person whom the Damderes wished to adopt. The Gaekwar,Malharrao, said he should be adopted according to custom. He gave no1# 20 poshak. Next day Hariba said that he should present ' Nazarana,' and that he must bring security. He was notable to find security. This was in May 1871. The boy now present is the same whom I presented to the Maharaj. This is the claimant Granpatrao Mahadavrao. 15. S hah M aiiammad R adhan M ia , now of B aroda , states :—The first of my family to arrive in Baroda was Hamid Jamadar about 126 years ago. My pre sent allowances are Rs. 85,000 annually, for the support of myself, sowars, and establishment. I have a 7 as. share in the village of Saral, value Rs. 6,000, or thereabouts. In the year Sanvat 1925 ( a.d . 1868) the late Gaekwar, Khande- rao, deprived me of my village Saral, on the ground that it was a Government village. It had been in our possession from Sanvat 1831 ( a.d . 1772) and was originally conferred on Hamid Jamadar by Fattehsing Maharaj. I have the Sanad giving it to him, which I now produce. (The Gaek war's Agents deny this Sanad on the ground that professing to be written by Fattehsing, it has the seal ot Seiaji). The language is Guzerathi. I produce a second Sanad (authenticity admitted by the Durbar) dated Sanvat 1833 ( a.d ! 1774) assigning a 7 as. share in the village of Saral to Hamid bin Amin; 7 as. to his younger brother, Jamin Jemadar, and 2 as. to the natural brother, Morad Ali. This Sa nad grants the village in perpetuity to them and their heirs. 1 also produce two orders from the Gaekwar, (admitted to be authentic), dated Sanvat 1867 i a.d. 1811,) one telling the Patel of Saral that the village has been granted in perpe tuity to Amin Jemadar, the other telling the village Accountant to give over charge of the village to Amin Jemadar's men. In the month of June last, or a year after the death of Eadhan Mia, who was my predecessor in the post I claim, and whose adopted son I am, my allowance of Ks. 85,000 was stopped by Malharrao. I was adopted by Radhan Mia on the day of his death, while he was still alive, and received on the third day the customary ' poshak ' from Go vernment. The people of the Durbar, who usually pay a visit onlstich occasions, came and had pansopari at my house. There was no reason whatever for stop ping my allowances. Nana Sahib, the present Minister, did it to appropriate them himself. Previous to this, the charge of the Mahal of Atarsumba, for which he enjoyed an allowance, was Rs. 25,000 or 30,000 annually, was taken from Radhan Mia by Khanderao Gaekwar. This 25,000 was part of the Rs. 85,000, alluded to above. I had 25 sowars in addition to the charge already stated. Of these 10 were discharged in Bhadarvad, Sanvat 1928 (July—August a.d . 1871) and the remaining 15 were discharged last month. The horses were my private property. I am now left utterly ruined. On the day of Radhan Mia's death, I gave a chit for a Nazarana of Rs. 1,00,000 to the Durbar, on account of my succession as his heir, and to his post and property. I got no receipt trom the Durbar. A portion of the Rs. 85,000 was Rs. 10,000, given to us as compensation for the loss of the management of the Atarsumba Mahal. I further produce an order from the present Commander-in-Chief, Bapuji Sahib, to Ramkrishn Sudaseo Punekar stating that ' all the property of Radhan Mia deceased, which had been under attachment, should be released, and taken care of for his son Shah Mahammad. It is dated Shravan (August) Sanvat 1929 (a.d. 1872).' (It is acknowledged to be genuine by the Gaek war's Agents). 1 claim now from the present Gaekwar all that was enjoyed by my father Radhan Mia as I have stated above. The Gaekwar's Agents reserve cross-examination. Reply of the Durhar :—We do not recognize the adoption, there being no adoption under Mahomedan Law. As sister's son of Radhan Mia he is only residuary legatee. On death of Radhan Mia, the boy Shah Mahammad offered a Nazarana of Rs. 1,00,000. This offer was considered for a year during which time the establishment was continued in Shah Mahammad's name. At the end of that time it was resolved to refuse the nazarana, to take up the pagah, and dismiss him21 from the command, but having consideration for him, we made him a personal allowance of Rs. 200 a month. We have taken no horses or private property at all. 16. Mahubula Khan Nazak Mahammad Khan , now of Baeoda:—I have no claim myself, but I appear on behalf of my daughter who married one Telaji Abdul Satar Silledar, who received from the Gaekwar Rs. 1,800 on account of his knowledge of archery and wrestling. Seiaji Gaekwar was the person who made the grant about a.d. 1833. Up to about the year Sanvat 1914 (a.d. 1857) Rs. 1,800 were paid. In that year KLanderao Gaekwar instead of continuing the Rs, 1,800 gave lis. 1,000 a year, and a village called Akota, the annual revenue of which was Rs. 4,000. The reason of this increase was because Telaji became the teacher of the Gaekwar in athletic exercises. About fortv years ago Telaji Abdul married my daughter. In Sanvat 1918 (a.d. 1861) Khanderao gave Telaji a palanquin allowance of Rs. 600 a year on account of the causes above stated. This property was held until Sanvat 1927 (a.d. 1«70). Then Telaji fell ill and stayed in his house for two months or so. In the meantime Malharrao Gaekwar ascended the throne, and he, without any cause, attached the village. About a month after Telaji died, and the Gaekwar, Malharrao, attached all his property, and gave his two widows Rs 25 a month for six months. Then about eighteen months ago the payments were stopped, and they have not, since then, been paid. In support of my claim, I produce a Sanad for the village of Akota, granting it to Telaji Abdul on hereditary tenure. (The genuineness of this Sanad is allowed by the Durbar). I also produce a Sanad granting the Palki allowance to Telaji hereditarily. (This Sanad is also allowed to be genuine by the Durbar). After the death of Telaji his private property was also attached, and property to the amount of Rs. 55,000 was taken away by the orders of Malharrao Gaekwar, and Rs. 20,000 were also taken away, which were in the village of Akota; my claim is that all this property which has been taken away may be restored to me. The Gaekwar's Agents defer cross-examination. Rephj of the Durhar in Sardar's C 16, Mahubula Khan The two widows quarrelled with each other as to the right of succession to the estate. The Durbar, therefore, took possession of the estate for the time being. One of the wi dows is dead, and if the survivor petitions the Government, enquiry will be made, f 17. Mahadavrao Jeshingrao Gabkwar of Baroda , states :—The first of my family was Pilajirao Gaekwar who came to this country about 130 years ago. I get Rs,. 30,000 annually from the State on account of my pagah. I have two Inam villages ; value about Rs. 6,000 and 2,000 respectively. Anandrao Maharaj gave my father these two villages. My father died some forty years ago when I was a little boy. The villages are in the ' Matosri Taraf.' They came under the management of my family Karkun, Bhao Jivaji, who mismanaged affairs, and I petitioned Khanderao in Sanvat 1920 (a.d. 1863) to give me the management of my pagah and affairs as I had now come to years of discretion. Khanderao did as I requested, and for two years I carried it on. The management was then trans ferred to my mother who handed it over to Bhao Jivaji. This lasted for about two years more, till the death of Khanderao Maharaj. On the accession of Malharrao I petitioned him, and he ordered that I should give subsistence to my mother and carry on the vahivat myself. I managed for the next six months, when, from some machinations of the Durbar, the whole of my property was taken from me, and re-transferred to my mother and Bhao Jivaji. I have represented all this to the Sarkar, but they do not attend to me. My prayer is that all my estate and property may be restored to me. I have no Sanads or documents in my possession. Cross - ex ci pi ined hy Gaekwar's Agen — I personally contracted no^ debts wdiile I was in charge of the pagah. I do not know what was the reason, if any, for taking the payali from my charge and giving it back to my mother. 1 he Sarkar by Nana Sahib Khanvelkar'offered me Rs r 125 monthly, but I said I was my father's son and entitled to my estate and refused to take the allowance. My mother and the Karkun, Bhao Jivaji, gave a Nazarana to Nana Sahib, and my22 estate was then transferred. I do not know whether any suit for debt was insti tuted against me in the Mahi Kanta (Sadra) Agent's Court, or decree sent down hither to be executed against me. The Nazarana which my mother gave was the attachment and seizure of my property by TatyaPant, the Commander-in- Chief's Karkun, This was given to the Sarkar. The value of the property was Rs. 50,000 or thereabouts. The Glaekwar's Agents desire to defer their further cros^s-examination in this case, &lt;&lt; tt- Reply of- the Durhar to Statement o /M aiiadavrao G abkwar , N o . 17 : - His statement generally is correct but is justified by the Durbar on the ground that his mother had represented he was so deeply in debt that he could not keep lis pagah and sowars in proper order. The management of the pagah was, theretore, handed over to her, and he was allowed Rs. 125 a month and a horse. His private property was attached and taken possession of by the Durbar at the instance of his mother. A list is kept in the Durbar. The property will be disposed of as his mother may direct; complaints against the inefficient state ol his sowars have also been received from the Sadra Political Agent. 18. G angajirao T rimbakrao K hanyelkar, states :— I have one Inam village, Pilol by name, and allowances to the amount of Rs. 3^,000 annually. I have still the Inam village valued at Es. 5,000 or so, but my allowances have been stopped. The allowances and the village were granted to me^ by Seiajirao Gaekwar some thirty-eight years ago. I got them from him on marrying his daugh ter. My only service was personal attendance on the Gaekwar. On the death ol Khanderao Maharaj, the present Gaekwar stopped the allowances. These were for the support of my sowars. There was no written order gi ven, or reason as signed for my losing my allowances; I merely had a verbal order one day that they were stopped. The present Dowan, Nana Sahib's father, used to enjoy 8,000 of the 30,000 ; while I got the remaining Rs. 22,000 and a further sum of Rs. 2,000 for miscellaneous expenses. I do not know who enjoys these allowances now. They have gone to the Government and have left me and my family. In a.d. 1858 Khanderao transferred my share of the above establishment, Rs. 22,000 to my son Mulajirao, and granted Rs. 4,000 additional to my younger son Amrutrao. He kept me near his person for two years, when he made me the ' Subha' of the Deesa contingent with an annual allowance of Rs. 29,800. On the news of the death of Khanderao reaching me, I at once left my charge at Deesa, came to Baroda, and went to Nana Sahib Khanvelkar my nephew. He and I fell out about the distribution of some property, and eight or fifteen days afterwards, on Nana's representations to the Gaekwar, Malharrao, I was deprived of all my property and commands. I was deprived even of my house, my former establishment of sepoys given to me by Seiajirao, and all that I had in Baroda, and having no other means of subsistence, I went off to my Inam village. I was shortly afterwards warned to clear out even from there. Nana Sahib took six horses, my private property, two palkis also private property, my residence, paga, and another house of mine, all in Baroda. All the personal pro perty that I had packed on carts when I left Baroda, was taken from them, thrown out and destroyed. The value of the private property destroyed was about Es. 4,500. This was exclusive of the houses which were worth about Rs. 50,000. All I want now is to have my property and estates restored to me. I produce the grant given me in a.d . 1836-37 showing the original establishment given me by Seiajirao Gaekwar as already described, (This Sanad is allowed to be genuine by the Gaekwar's Agent), I produce also a Sanad from Khanderao showing my appointment and al lowances as Subha of the Deesa Contingent as stated above, (This is also ac knowledged to be genuine). There is no Sanad showing the transfer of my ori ginal charge from me to my sons, but the order, therefore, will no doubt be found in the Government Records. The Gaekwar's Agents reserve cross-examination.23 Z 7 Reply of the Durbar: The a Mmuok' was given to him by Seiajirao in con- sequenec o is marrying' Seiajis daughter.

Grovernment was no onger oun o continue therm The village Pilol given to his wife was how- e^er e o im a solutely.^ Similar resumptions under similar circumstances cus omai y under previous Gaekwars. On the ground of domestic quarrels, That Gangajirao, when in power under the late Gaekwar, Khanderao, had c epnyed the fatber-in-law of the present Gaekwar of his ^^ ^umnok' , and expelled him from Baroda, it was considered unadvisable to conti nue the allowances. The horses taken from him were in lieu of Government horses which he had not returned when deprived of his Subha. 'We took six, but he still owes us seven, the number of Government horses in his possession being thirteen. He also owes the State about Rs. 15,000. We have taken no private property. 3rd The house he was deprived of was Government and not private pro perty. ^ f. ^ UI ^ AJIRA0 G angajiiuo K hanvelkak states :—About eight years ago T had my fathers allowance of Hs. 22,000 given to me on the ground of my being Sexajirao s grandson, and Khanderao's nephew; my father was then alive and is still living. Some three years ago on the accession of Malharrao, Nana Sahib, the present Dewan, came from his home in the Ratnagiri District, and making his own representations to the Gaekwar, I was forbidden to come to meet Malharrao and told to leave Baroda at once. I therefore went to Pilol; my establishment of Rs. 22,000 was confiscated by the Sarkar, but I do not know to whom it was given. 1 wo sepoys and sowars came to Pilol a month afterwards and confiscated six of our horses, four belonging to my father, two to me. My two were worth Rs. 1,400 or 1,500. They also took our Vada, paga, &amp;c., as stated by my father. The reason of all this being done to us was a private quarrel of my father with Nana Sahib about some land in the Ratnagiri District; my present claim is to have my two horses and my charge of Rs. 22,000 restored to me. The record of the change of the establishment of Rs 22,000 from my father's charge to mine is to be found in the Government Records. I have none. The Gaekwar's Agents reserve cross-examination. Reply of the Durbar: —No regular grants were made to him in Khanderao's time, and we resumed the allowances made to him on the same grounds as we did those made to his father, thinking we had a perfect right to do so. 20. Amrutrao Gangajirao Khanvelkar states :—Some ten years ago * i e. grand-son of Khanderao Maharaj made me an allowance of Rs. 4,000 Seiajirao and nephew of annually on account of my expenses as the descendant* of piesent Gaekwar. my ancestors. On Khanderao's death Malharrao, the present Gaekwar, stopped the payment of this sum. I drew the money for 7 years. I did nothing for the salary except remain near the person of Khanderao. I do not know why it was stopped. I was merely told that it was stopped. I want my allowance for these three years paid up, and to be secured to me. The Gaekwar's Agents defer cross-examination. Reply of the Durbar : —We give the same reply as in case No. 19, Gunajirao. 21. Balaji Govindlal of Ahmedabad , states : — I appear as representative of Motilal Samal, the bankers of Baroda, Ahmedabad, Surat and Bombay. I am Mo- tilal's son-in-law. He diedtwoor three months ago from grief, and has left a sonfive years old. I am now the representative of the firm. Our firm originally belong ed to Ahmedabad. Samal was the founder of the firm 100 or 125 years ago, and received, in return for his services as Supply Agent and Banker to the Baroda State, from Govindrao Maharaj, a pagah of 62 horses, one palkhi and ten foot-24 \ JS. «cSf' ft men. The Inam village of Aurungpur, now Dewalipur, was given to him by Seiaii Maharaj. We had a Saaad for these till a.d . 1840, but lost-it on the burn ing of 'our house that year in Baroda. We saved a copy of this S'anad, but lost' the original. After Samal came Motilal and Harilal in a. d . 1829, who were continued in the establishments above detailed, and also received another palkhf-and two more villages, Gadula and Jivkor. These were given to the firm by Seiaji Maharaj for banking services rendered to the Gaekwar Government. He also gave them a orant in that year, 1829, to the effect that we were continued in all Samal's hohburs. 1 produce the original grant. (The genuineness of the Sanad is admitted by the Gaekwar's Agent, It professes to continue the allowances, &amp;c., granted to Samal, so long as Harilal and Motilal continue to serve the State as bankers and con firms the statement of the witness). I produce a second original Sanad conferring the rights on us in perpetuity of the two palkhis, (This is also acknowledged to be genuine). In the time of the Maharaj Khanderao an allowance of Bs. 900 annually was conferred hereditarily on Motilal, for peons as runners to precede him. I produce the ' Karar' (which is acknowledged to be genuine by the Gaekwar's Agents), In 1865 in place of Jivkor, we got the village of Fattehpur, Rs. 1,280, from Khanderao in perpetuity, I produce the Sanad showing (This is also acknowledged to be genuine). I produce a copy of the Sanad granting Dewalipur in perpetuity, the original of which was burnt as stated above, I produce the original Sanad for Qadula granting it annually (admitted to be genuine). The total value of our allowances in the way of pagah, palkis, personal allow ances, and Inam villages came to about Rs. 35,000 annually. The whole of these allowances, &amp;c., were stopped fifteen months ago by Malharrao, the present Gaek war, The ostensible ground of his stopping them was a false claim for debts owed to the State for fifty years past. He claimed Rs. 1,25,000 in all from us. Out of this sum he said he found from our books Rs. 64,000 owing to the State, He took away our books and has since kept them in his own possession. We do not admit the debt at all. The Nana Sahib has, however, since settled this with us, and we have no complaint to make about it. There was a second item of Rs. 60,000 which Nana Sahib has now settled, and we have no quarrel about that, There remains but one item of Rs. 20,000 which the present Government claims as a Court fee on a suit for Rs. 3,84,000 which we brought against Bechar Nathu in the first Court of the Gaekwar, Khanderao, however, exempted us from the fee, and directed that the suit should proceed without fees being taken, We, therefore, now object to pay the money, The total amount dne to us now by the Sardars, Silledars, &amp;c., is about 15 lakhs of Rupees, This amount I claim that the Gaekwar's Government should assist me in recovering from these Sardars and Silledars, by deducting the amounts due to me from their pay. The value of the horses which formed my pagah in the Kattywar Contin gent, 62 in number, confiscated at the same time was about Rs, 12,000, including their equipments. All the private property of the firm which w T as in Gaekwarj territory has been attached. I cannot say what was the value of it. Motilal after this petitioned the Resident, and lived for four months in the Camp here in a place assigned to him by the Resident. Motilal went to Ahmedabad on urgent business about fifteen months ago. The day after he left, his property and every thing was attached, and he remained in Ahmedabad till he came to Baroda about six months ago. He then stayed, as I said before, in Camp for four months and died after an illness of a few days in Ahmedabad, to which plaice he returned when he first fell ill. I succeeded him in the business and am new to it. I have lost lakhs of rupees from this and have been forced to close my Banks in Ahmedabad, Surat and Bombay. No one will do any business with me now, I have lost my credit, The Gaekwar's Agents reserve crossr-examination,/I 25 fr* 4 . Reply of the Durbar. We divide our answer into six Leads:— ls^. With reference to the pagah being attached and confiscated we say that Motilal has shown no right to have his pagah in perpetuity, and the Maharaj considered that when Motilal left Baroda without his leave he jlspokt to resume his pagah. He accordingly did so. The horses of t^fe?pagah, 62 in number, we admit to be private property, but at the ^ii^e we took them we thought they were the Silledar's horses. The r State dealings with Motilal have not yet been completed. When accounts are adjusted his horses will be restored to him. With reference to the confiscation of his Inam village, we state that it was given to the firm at a time when it had had extensive dealings with the (xovernment, and when large sums were due to the Bankers. It was given in part satisfaction of the Government debts. When the village was resumed the Government did so, considering from an exa mination of its own accounts that the debt had been paid in full, and that there was no necessity for continuing the grant any longer. The Bank's books were not compared with those of the State. The Bankers did not appear for this purpose. 3rc/.—With reference to the confiscation of the sepoy 'Nimnok' the Government considered that Motilal having left Baroda without permis sion was no longer a State servant, and that it had, therefore, the right to resume the establishment. kth.—Motilal having gone away from Baroda without leave, and there being no one in charge of his shops and property in Baroda, they were put under attachment, locks and seals were put on, but no list of property was made out. Information was given to the Resident six or seven months ago that Motilal was at liberty to come and take possession of his property, but he never came. ^th.—The payments of sums guaranteed by the Government will be made according to the terms of the guarantee. 6^.—The fees demanded from Motilal were usual and such as it is custom ary to demand in the cases of suitors in the Civil Courts. We deny that Khande rao ever forgave the fees as alleged. The Gaekwar's Agents further state that in Khanderao's time the question arose as to whether or no State Bankers should be allowed ifo bring actions on plain paper or not, and that in several instances it was decided that they should not. 22. B haskarao V ithal , now of B aroda , states:—The first of my family to come to Baroda was my grandfather Babaji, who was succeeded by my father. Vithal Babaji, received from Anandrao, for services rendered in Kattywar, two Inam villages and allowances of Rs. 60,000 annually, &amp;c. My father Vithal was continued in his honours. In the year Sanvat 1890 ( a.d . 1833-34) my affairs were settled, and I received a Sanad from Seiaji Maharaj, which I now produce. [This Sanad, (admitted to be genuine), conveys sanction of the Government to the adoption of Bhasker Vithalrao, and the continuation in perpetuity of the honors bestowed on his father.] The date is a.d . 1830, I next produce a Sanad dated Sanvat 1867 ( a.d . 1804) granting the two Inam villages to Babaji in perpetuity (admitted to be genuine). The Vahivat of these two villages was carried on by me for forty years, and was taken from me in Sanvat 1924 ( a.d . 1867) by Khanderao. The state of my affairs in a.d . 1833-34, when the guarantee was taken from me, was thus ;— Karkun Establishment Rs. 22,900 Personal 60,000 Pagah ,, 30,000 Two Inam Villages „ 10,000 Total...Rs. 1,22,90026 This lasted till Sanvat 1911 ( a.d . 1854) when Ganpatrao sto PP ed ^ 30,000 pagah and 10,000 Inam villages. These remained with me as be e till Sanvat 1924 ( a.d . 1867) when they were stopped by Khanderao 1 ^ f e b h promised over and over again to get them back, bnt I have not had any oi t restored. No reason was assigned for stopping them. My desire now is that my houses and establishment should be restored to me. Gross- examined by G aekwar's Agents :—I did go to Jodhpur; but after I had asked the leave of the Gaekwar to do so. Bhao Sindia, his Minister, gave me verbal permission. I did not get the ' Poshak' on leaving the was not his servant. He (i.e., Khanderao) had stopped my ^ s - ' How then was I his servant ? I was doing the pagah service ot fc. &gt; that time. The Gaekwar's Agents admit the fact of the stoppage of the pagah aHowance of Rs. 30,000 and of the resumption of the Inam villages valued at Ks. iu,uuu alleging as the reason, therefore, tkat complainant had v or • ? j without the orders of the late Gaekwar Khanderao, and that he was p for his disobedience. The present Gaekwar, they add, has done no mg m matter. Re -examined by Commission: —I have not been into the city of Baioda for twoyearspast. The present Gaekwar .Malharrao, has forbidden me to enter it, ana had me expelled thence two months ago, when I went to my house. The Gaekwar's Agents defer cross-examination on this point. Reply of the Durbar in case No. 22, B haskarao V ithal With reference to Bhaskarao Vithal's assertion that he has been expelled from the city ot tfaroda, the Durbar Agents state that Khanderao gave the order for expulsion, and tne present Gaekwar has not thought it advisable to rescind the order. With reference to the dismissal of Bhaskarao for going to Jodhpur without leave, the Durbar Agents state that he went there to take service under the Raja of Jodhpur, and the Gaekwar being displeased, gave him his dismissal. 23. S ahbbsing and N asibsing , Sons of B himsing , depose;—We formerly had annual allowances of Rs. 700 for a Palki and Rs. 8,000 for a Tahinat oi six sowars and sixty-five footmen, the latter in Patan. The late Gaekwar resumed the Palki allowance eleven years ago, and reduced the Tahinat by two sowars and all the footmen five or six years ago ; our allowance being at the same time dimi nished by Rs. 3,000. We appealed to the late Gaekwar against this proceeding, but our petition was rejected. We have also recently petitioned the present Gaekwar to the same effect, but have as yet got no answer. We have also a complaint about a garden in the city of Baroda which has been injured by a Durbar Kamdar causing us a loss of Rs. 200. We have petitioned the Maharaja in this case, but have got no redress. The Durbar Agent remarks that this is not a case against the Maharaja personally, and that the complaint regarding the garden is still under investiga tion. The Commission consider further enquiry in this case unnecessary. 24. A nandeao G ovind P hansb , of Baroda , states :—My family first came to Baroda seventy-five years ago in the time of Govindrao Maharaj. My great grand father, in consequence of his services as Mamlutdar, received from Govindrao one Inam village Umetha, revenue Rs. 1,000 annually. His son, my grandfather Sivaji Balvant, received in addition an annual allowance from Anandrao Maharaj of Rs. 7,800 for Palkhi allowance, &amp;c., and another village, Deola—Rs. 440. Deola was27 y / resumed by Khanderao Maharaj in Sanvat 1924 ( a. d . 1867-68) as being a Khalsa and not an Inam village. The allowance of Rs. 7,800 was stopped in 1927-28 (a.d . 18 &gt;9-70). This we mentioned to the Pandare and other Sardars. We also had an establishment of thirteen sowars at Sadra. This was confiscated last July, on account of reductions, which, we were told, were being made. The charge was made over to the Suba. We also told this to the Pandare Sardars in conse quence of the assurances they have conveyed to us in the mutiny year, 1858, at Kapura that we were not to be reduced. The thirteen horses were our private property. We have, since then, in the course of last October, received back our charge of horse. We have also received payment of the arrears of our allowance of Rs. 7,800 for one year, and chits for the other year have also been given to us, within the last ten days, which we have not yet cashed. We have now no cause of complaint, except that Deola has not been restored to us. The charge of Umetha has never been taken from us. The Durbar Agent states that Deola was a Dumala village, which the com plainant held as part of his allowances, and that on its resumption, he was given a cash payment instead, to make up the total of his State allowances. 25. Rajaram Anandrao, Jagtap of Baroda , states :—I formerly had two sowars for whom I received Rs. 300 and a personal allowance of Rs. 934 from the Government. The sowars were taken from me by order of Khanderao Gaek- war in Sanvat 1917 ( a.d . 1860), and a portion of my personal allowance of Rs. 8B4 was stopped by Malharrao Maharaj; Rs. 300 of it only being offered to me for my subsistence. I refused to take this, and some five or six days ago the restoration of the original allowance of Rs. 834 was ordered. I have received ' chits' for the two years' arrears that are due. I have now only to complain about the reduction of the sowar taken from me in 1860. The Durbar remarks in this case that in September last, all complainants of this class were told that their claims would be adjusted, and ' chits' were pre pared for their liquidation, but the parties concerned would not come to take them, as owing to some disputes between them and their shroffs, they were un willing to come forward for that purpose ; hence the claims remained unadjusted. 26. Sudasbo Bhavani Valambhe of Baroda I had an establishment of 23 sowars in the Sadra contingent for which I received Rs. 10,000 annually from the Gaekwar's Government. This was all confiscated by the Gaekwar s orders last June. I went to the Pandare Sardars and others, and mentioned it to them, in consequence of the assurances which they had conveyed to us from the Gaek war in 1858 that we were not to be reduced. I have since then in October received all my establishment and ' pagah' back from the Government. I have received pay for one year's allowances which were in arrears, and am promised ' chits' for the other, so that I have now no complaint whatsoever to make against the Gaekwar. At the time that my pagah was confiscated the Bakshi told me that I was dismissed; but that, instead of my allowances as before, I should receive a subsistence allowance of Rs. 1,200. The Durbar have no remarks to offer. 27. Lakshmanbao Tuljajirao Jagtap ;—We three brothers of the Jagtap family formerly kept up four sowars for which we received from the Govern ment Bs 2,800. In 1913 ( a.d . 1860) one sowar was reduced, and othei allow ances diminished by Rs. 300. Some two years ago, we were informed that the remaining three men were also to be reduced, and our allowances cut down to a pension of Rs. 300 for each of us. Wb objected to this, and told the Pandai^t and other Sardars. Orders were issued five or six days ago by the Gaekwar s Government that our allowances, as they existed since 1860, were to be restoie . We have not yet received the chits, but they are promised to us. We have no further complaint to make. The Durbar have no remarks to offer.28 28. Ghtoabeao J aurao J agtap :—States in substance what has already been recorded in Nos. 26 and 27, his case being similar to theirs ; but adds that in Sanvat 1912 (a.d. 1855) the three families he represents paid a Nazarana of Rs. 10,000 to Ganpatrao Gaekwar, in order that their allowances might be con tinued. In spite of this, however, the late Gaekwar Khanderao ordered in 1860 similar reductions in their case to those set forth in Nos. 26 and 27; deponent has no complaint to make now against the present Gaekwar's Government. The Durbar have no remark to make. 29. S akhabam D bvbao J agtap for himself and nephew Y adhavrao —has no complaint whatever to make against the present G-aekwar. His father's allowances were K.s. 3,300 and at his death these were cut down to Rs. 1,000 for him, 500 for his nephew Yadavrao, and Rs. 300 for his brother's widow. This was done by Ganpatrao Gaekwar seventeen or eighteen years ago. The present Gaekwar has made no reduction whatever. The Durbar offer no remarks. 30. S alambin M ahamad bin H amid states :— I am the descendant of one of the original Arabs who came with Govindrao G-aekwar more than 100 years ago. He fought in the Porebunder campaign. On his death his son succeeded him and was followed by my father, in whose time, and till two and a quarter years ago our establishment was a pagah of 36 Sowars and personal allowance Rs. 8,085 . 72 Foot soldiers „ 9,672 Total Rs. 17,757 On my father's death, twenty years ago, my brother succeeded him. He held the charge for ten years, arid was followed by myself. In 1871 Malharrao Gaekvyar took away my pagah and personal allowance, and only one year ago my charge of foot was also taken from me for no reason whatsoever, and handed over to Eshvant- rao, a relative of Hariba, the Revenue Commissioner. Within the last ten days, however, I have had my foot charge restored to me, and what I want now is to get my ' pagah' given back. I received nothingwhatsoever from the Government in compensation of the deprivation of my pagah. My complaint is that I have been causelessly dismissed. The Durbar admit the correctness of the statements made by complainant as to the loss of his pagah and the transfer of his charge of foot to the Darogah, but desire to consult the Gaekwar before assigning reasons. Further statement of the Durbar : —Mahammad bin Hamid took charge of pagah and foot, but he and his son, this witness, getting heavily involved in debt, the whole charge was taken from him (Salam,) and given by Khanderao to Limbaji, the Mahratta Commander-in-Chief, he being given a personal allowance of Rs. 100 a month, This was in Sanvat 1918 ( a.d . 1861) the pagah, &amp;c., continu ing in Salam's name.. On Malharrao's accession enquiry was made, and the charge of the foot, with allowances fixed at Rs. 10,000 given to Salam in Sanvat 1928 ( a.d . 1871.) The pagah was handed over to Seikh Umar. The Palki and Servants allowances were resumed by the State. 31. S heik U mar bin A bdulla (appearing by his brother A bdul K adr) :— I am one of the original Arabs whose father fought in Kattywar. For his work there, he received the following establishment:— 28 Horses : Pagah.I 72 Foot soldiers. &gt; of the value of Rs, 16,000 annually. 1 Palki. jOn Ins death some forty years ago the Grovernment made two shares of his establishment as follows :— Sheik Ahmad. Sheik Umar. 14 Horses. 36 Foot. 1 Palki. I have had charge of my share for forty years, till about a year ago, when a Mahratta, by name Ramrao, was made Darogah over my foot charge. He has, however, been removed within the last few days, and the charge restored to me. I want my accounts with him to be settled. My pagah also was threatened but has not been touched. I have a field of 60 bighas with a well in it at Amreli, which was attached by Khanderao seven years ago. I have petitioned him for its restoration, but not Malharrao, the present Graekwar. The Durbar have no remarks to offer. 32. G uldaj valad A bdulla S akar states;—-In the time of Anandrao Graek war my grandfather received a charge of 30 foot withan allowance of Rs. 3,000, which was held by my father and myself in succession. I have served for some twenty years. In Sanvat 1917 ( a.d . 1860) Khanderao, the late Graekwar, transferred ten of my men to the Commander-in-Chief, and reduced my E,s. 3,000 to Rs. 2,175. About a year ago, Eshwantrao, a Mahratta Darogah, was placed in charge over me, but he was removed a few days ago, and all I want now is a settlement of my accounts with him, and the restoration of the ten men of whom I -was deprived by His Highness Khanderao. The Durbar ofier no remarks. 33. M ahadaveao D alputrao G abkwar :—My grandfather came here in the time of Grovindrao Graekwar, and received from him the village of Bhaopura, value Rs. 200, and an establishment with allowances of Rs. 65,000 for sowars, &amp;c. This continued till my father's time, but before I succeeded him, the year I can not name, the establishment was settled as follows:— Bhaopura—Rs. 200, and pagah of 32 horses—Rs. 15,000. I know no reason for reductions made. I have had this for thirty years my self. Some seven or eight years ago when His Highness the late Khanderao took up the Dumala villages, he resumed mine with the rest, giving me Rs. 225 annually instead; last year His Highness Malharrrao Graekwar reduced eight of my sowars, but they were restored to me about two months ago, and I have no complaint to make about them. All I want is to have the Inam village restored to me. I still draw the Rs. 225 granted in lieu of it. The Durbar have no remarks to offer. 34. J otajirao M oradrao S indb P haker states:—My great-grandfather received, eighty years ago,from Anabarao Gaekwar,the following establishment:— A pagah of 23 horses, &amp;c., with an annual allowance of Rs. 8,064. This has continued 0 down till my time. The descent is Anandrao I adopted Manaji, who ! adopted Moradji, who I adopted I have had charge of the pagah for the last forty years. In June last, my pagah was transferred to SivajiraoKhanvelkar, the present Gaekwar s Subha and Divan. He also demanded all my private horses and property, but I refused to 14 Horses pagah. 8,300 36 Foot. ) ' h — 1 2930 part witli them, and applied to the Pandare and other great Sardars on the strength of the guarantee given to ns by His Highness the late Gaekwar in a.d . 1858. I received back charge of my establishment last month, and have got the ' chits ' for payment of the arrears due. The money has not yet been paid, but I hope it will be. I have no other complaint to make. The Durbar admit the general correctness of the statement, but challenge the alleged guarantee as in other similar cases. / 35. Y adaveao T ukaji K adam , statesMy father had the following esta blishment :— Horses 25 ''j Palkhi J&gt; with an allowance of Rs. 32,250. He had no son of his own Followers j and adopted me. On his death I got 25 horses, and followers with an allowance of Rs. 11,350. This was in Sanvat 1918 ( a.d . 1861), and was done by Khanderao as I was an adopted son. On the death of my mother, Sanvat 1926 ( a.d . 1869), the daughter of Seiaji Gaekwar, Khanderao assumed charge of her estate, amounting to about a lakh of Rupees, and it has since been under attachment till a short time ago when Malharrao confiscated it for the Government. She was not my real mother, only my adoptive one. I have never made any petition to get this property given to me. Last year Malharrao reduced Rs. 1,900 from my following, as he was reducing all round. Orders have lately been issued to have this restored to me, and I have no further quarrel against the Gaekwar, than that I should get back my adoptive mother's estate. The Durbar desire to defer their remarks in this case till the 20th instant. Reply of the Durbar: —On the death of his adoptive mother in Sanvat 1925 (a.d . 1868,) Khanderao Gaekwar took charge of the property and person of Yadav- rao, who was a minor. In Sanvat 1927 ( a.d . 1870) Yadav's step-mother Ranibai applied for the charge of the person and property of the minor, which was given to her Agent, Venkatrao, on her behalf. Next year Yadav's paternal grandmother Babai complained that Ranibai was wasting the estate, and on inquiry being made, charge of the person and property of the minor was given to her, a receipt for the whole amount of the property being taken from her, though property, which, it was supposed, would yield Rs. 50,000 on sale, was kept back for Nazarana. On sale, however, the amount realized was only Rs. 35,000. Yadavrao is still in the charge of his grandmother Babai. 36. A nandrao N aeayenrao D ahivat states:—My father had the follow ing tahinat and allowances derived from various Gaekwars:— Tahinat including two dumala* villages ... Rs. 13,288 Killedar's allowance (and ten horses. Govern ment property) „ 4,000 Pagah of one hundred horses „ 31,080 Personal allowance ,, 12,000 Inam Village Sarsaoli ,, 18,000 78,368 He also had a house, stables, &amp;c., at Sarsaoli worth Rs. 2,50,000 Garden and Bungalow at Baroda ,, 2,00,000 His wife was the daughter of Khanderao Gaekwar. He died in January Sanvat 1928 ( a.d . 1871) and adopted me as his son on the day of his death. I was acknowledged by the present Gaekwar as the adoptive son, received 'poshak,' and went through all the official ceremonies consequent on acknowledgment. The question of Nazarana was then mooted, and after some time 3 lakhs of Rupees was agreed upon as the amount. It was not, however, taken, and Hariba * Vauadsa 3,000 Rowad 7,175 10,17531 Dada, Revenue Commissioner, demanded my village of Sarsaoli as well. This I would not agree to; Malharrao handed the case over to Balvantrao Raholkar, and he coming to my grandmother made her give up Sarsaoli, my garden and bungalow in Baroda, and promise three lakhs of Rupees as the Nazarana. I did not agree to this, and all that I have been allowed to retain is my pagah of one hundred horse and personal allowance of Rs. 12,000. I have been deprived of everything else. The two Dumala villages were taken up by Khanderao Gaekwar when he took up the rest of the Dumala villages in the district. 1 am willing to give a Nazarana such as is usually given by people in my position, but not the excessive sum which has been asked. I cannot say exactly how much I am willing to give. The Durbar reserve their remarks on this case till the 22nd instant. Reply of the Durhar ;—The adoption was recognised by the Government, and at the time of sanctioning it we gave him what we chose to give. 37. B abaji K asirao D humsi states ;—My father died in Sanvat 1901 {a.d. 1844,) and having no son of his own adopted me with the consent of Seiaji- rao Gaekwar. I received no ' poshak,' but the Bakshi and the Silledars came to my house to eat pansopari as is customary- The establishment which I in herited from my father was six horses with an allowance of Rs. 161 monthly, and I retained this from 1844 till last March, when being away at Sadra and serv ing with the contingent there, I heard that my cousin Ramchandar Appa Dhumse had given a Nazarana of Rs. 4 ,000 to the State, through the present Dewan Khanvelkar with a personal Nazarana of Rs. 500 to the latter, and that my tahinat had been transferred to him. I at once came to Baroda and was told by the Nana Sahib himself, when I went to him, that if I chose to give him a ' Nazarana' of Rs. 5,000, I should get my charge back. I refused to do this, and Ramchandar still has possession of it. I told the Pandare Sardars what had happened to me. The whole of the horses were my private property. Two of the horses had died some months before and the value of the remaining four was about Rs. 400. The Durbar Agent remarks that the transfer was made as stated, but he is not prepared to-day to reply to the allegation about the Nazarana. lieply of the Durhar :—The amount of Nazarana received by the State was Rs. 2,000 and not Rs. 4,000 as alleged. The personal Nazarana of Rs. 500 to the Dewan we deny altoget 1 38. B hagvantrao G opalrao jladav states :—Seiajirao Gaekwar on the occasion of his marriage gave my father a personal allowance of Rs. 500 annually. This was subsequently increased to Rs. 1,000 in Sanvat 1911 ( a.d . 1854) by Ganpatrao, who further gave me at the same time an allowance of Rs. 1,000 and a house in Baroda to my father. Both our allowances were in Sanvat 1916 (a.d . 1859) raised by Khanderao to Rs. 1,800 in consequence of our being smart soldiers. In Sanvat 1923 ( a.d . 1866) my father died, and his allowance was re sumed by Khanderao. Mine continued till Khanderao s death when Malharrao at once stopped the allowance and took my house, on the ground that I was a favourite of Khanderao. I have been offered Rs. 327 annually from the Government, but refuse to take it as I consider I am entitled to my old allowances of Rs. 1,800. The Durbar Agent remarks that the Maharaj considered this man to be of bad character and stopped his allowance accordingly. The witness produces a Sanad in support of his statement about the gift of the house. It shows that it was given to his father and heirs for ever, and is acknowledged by the Gaekwar's Agents to be genuine.32 39. Mahadavrao Ramrao Pagedar states :—The first of my family was my great-grandfather, who received from Damajirao Gaekwar a pagah of 29 horses at .....Rs. 10,928 Personal allowance „ 1,020 The I nam village of Varkheria, revenue about „ 800 of which I gave Rs. 327 to the State. And a subsistence allowance paid in kind, but commuted after wards by Bhao Sindia to „ 89 Rs. 12,837 These allowances, &amp;c., remained in my house till Sanvat 1925 ( a.d . 1868,) when Khanderao resumed the village. I had 100 years' occupancy as my Sanad for it. He gave no compensation for it. On Malharrao's accession he reduced four of my horses, but has in the last eight or ten days restored them to me, and my only remaining complaint is about my village of Varkheria, and apiece of land four hundred bighas in extent over which I had the right of free grazing from as long back as I can remember, and my father often told me the same about himself, which Malharrao last year gave over to a contractor or farmer. The Durbar Agent remarks :—The four humdred bighas formed part of a farm of the village of Taoria, which was let to the witness, but in consequence of complaints made by the ryots against his undue exactions, the contract for the whole village including this four hundred bighas was cancelled. We cannot say how long before the lease, which is dated 1920 ( a.d . 1863), the witness had the occupancy of these four hundred bighas. This village was not Inam but Dumala. 40. Raghunathrao Ramrao Jagtap states —My great-grandfather received from Grovindrao an allowance of Rs. 2,642 which remained in our family till Sanvat 1924 ( a.d . 1866) when Khanderao fixed it at Rs. 2,100. This was further reduced by Malharrao two years ago to Rs, 600, but within the last five or six days he has restored the allowance to Rs. 2,100, I want my allowance fixed as it was before Khanderao reduced it. Reply of the Durbar : —No remarks to make. Statement by the Resident, Baroda, at the stance of which was orally made before 1873. 25th November 1873, When I arrived at Baroda in March last, I found a good deal of excitement going on among the principal Sardars of the State in consequence of certain of their own body and of the Silledars having been deprived of what they considered their hereditary rights. It appears that about three months previously to my arrival, they had gone up in a body to the Senaputee and the Dewan to state their grievances, which, however, were not inquired into. 2. This state of things continued until September, as already reported by „ - d ,j t f? a me to Government; when being apprehensive that the ResidentsReportNo. 174— mt r* i- xi. x • j. j • i x /&gt; n 856, 20th September, para. 4. 'Reeling that existed might find some expression amongst the followers of the Sardars, at the approach ing Dassera, I strongly advised the Minister and Rao Saheb Bapubhai to invite them to a jDurbar, at which each man should be asked what he had to state, and thus the real causes of complaint would be arrived at. Report No. 182—873, of 24th . ^ On the 22nd September three of the Durbar September 1873. waited upon me to ask my further advice, which I gave to the same effect as above. 4. I was at the same time consulted by the Sardars through a Karkun of one of them, and I sent word that the menacing attitude which they had assumed,was not right; tliat they should take their pay and leave the question of the Sille- dars, and Sardars, Dhamdere and Radhanmia, &amp;c., to His Highness the Maha raja, to whom I would offer advice on the subject. 5. This had the desired effect and the Sardars then accepted the chits for their pay for two and a half years in arrears. 6. After this a dispute arose about the payment of these chits which was not settled in many cases, until the night before the assembly of the Commis sion, in whose presence they stated, that they had then no complaint against the Government. 7. I deem it necessary to bring to the notice of the Commission that until the morning of the I Oth instant, when their proceedings commenced, I had never seen more than two of the principal Sardars to converse with; and I did not know what the personal complaints of even those were. All I knew was that, as a body, the Sardars regard themselves as the Military nobility of the State, and that as such their service is hereditary ; that the permanent character of this service was ratified to them by the last Graekwar at the time of the mutiny ; and conse quently that when they recently saw 212 effective Silledars pensioned off, and the descendants of certain principal Sardars deprived of what they considered their hereditary rights, they regarded the procedure as preparatory to their own downfall; and therefore, they combined together to resent it. They affirm that it is not the reduction of State expenditure, that, as a rule, has led to these changes, but the substitution of certain favourites of the present Minister and Maharaja for old servants of the State. I have been informed by the Maharaja himself that he contemplates the eventual reduction of the whole body; and hence the whole question is one of the highest political importance that has still to be provided for. 8. Since the Sardars gave their evidence before the Commission, and the reply of the Durbar denying that assurances were ever given by His Highness Khanderao at the time of the mutinies has become known, about eighty or one hundred of the Silledars have attended at the Residency to ask permission to give evidence as to the fact that the assurances referred to were given. (Signed) R. PHAYRE, Resident. i 1 33SCHEDULE 11. C ase N o. 2. I sL Partesingliji Umedsinghji, Thakor of Ghanta,in Bijapur Mahal, states :— My village contains abont 50 or 60 houses, has about 2,000 bighas of land, and the total revenue of it is about Rs. 2,000. The survey of the village was begun a payment in lieu of some 10 years ago, but was never completed. The only forage and supplies whreh the Jamabandi which the Government has any right to Thakors were bound to furnish levy from me is ' ghas dana,'* tribute, and this has m ormer ays. gradually and without cause been increased as follows :—• In it was Rs. 52-1 8 0 la! „ „ 539 8 0 H „ „ 564 8 0 lal „ „ 675 0 0 2nd. Formerly, at the time of paying our tribute, we used to receive from the Vahivatdar a pagri and sirpao and meswani allowances. These in my case amounted to Es. 20 and Rs. 2 respectively. These allowances were stopped by order of Khanderao Maharaj in 3rcL I formerly had 'giras' haks in 8 villages of the Bijapur Mahal and one of the Kadi Mahal, amounting in all to Rs. 174-8-0. By the introduction of the Inam Committee these were reduced in to Rs. 38-2-0, exclusive of my hak in the Kadi village, which has been left unsettled. 4^4. I took the reduced amount of Rs. 38-2-0 for 6 years, and then on the Vahivatdar further reducing that amount by 2 annas in the rupee on account of Inam Committee tax, I refused to accept it. Though the amount to be paid to me has been settled at Rs. 38-2-0 only, the Vahivatdar still collects the former sum of Rs. 174-8-0. 5£/i. In one of the Government villages I enjoyed the right of getting one goat annually from each Shepherd, and in another 1|- seers of cotton from each Dher, but by the orders of the Vahivatdar, and pleading their poverty, the ryots have ceased giving me these haks since 6^. I had the right of receiving the fourth of the produce of 384 bighas of land in Bijapur, and 150 bighas in Kadi, but the people are so poor that they refuse to pay me these dues. This has also lasted since ^ '4° in the reign of Khanderao. I petitioned him about it but got no redress—not even an answer. 7th. I have not received my ' giras' hak of Rs. 11-4-0 in the Kadi village since J-||, as the Inam Committee has not settled what it is to be. Qth. I have personally no grain haks. Qth. If any of us mortgage any of our land the mortgagee pays to the State a tax of 2 annas in the rupee, and when we take up this land again we have to pay this 2 annas tax. This 2 annas tax is an annual one. 1 0th. Since ^ Thanadars have been placed in the mahals, and we have been deprived of our jurisdiction in criminal cases. I had power to fine up to Rs. 5 and to imprison for 8 days. llth. There used to be, and there still exists, a tax of Rs. 1-4-0 upon all first marriages in our villages, which we still draw, but in addition to this the ii — 2 aGaekwar has introduced another tax of Rs. 5 on each ' natra' or remarriage, which he takes to himself. mil. In the year *^1 the custom of giving safe conducts to Thakors leaviDo- their villages for the Yahivatdar's town, or Baroda, was abolished, and in consequence of this I suffered the disgrace in of being kept m custody at Bijapur for 2 days, because I refused to pay the ' Accession nazarana tax. The Commissioners are of opinion that the 13th grievance, being the sum of the Thakor's complaints, should be kept to the last. Its number is there fore changed from 13 to 17.) 1 Mh.It was in -xr^eVthat the Government of Khanderao Gaekwar did away with the custom of summoning our ryots through us, and directed that when sent for bv the Vahivatdar, they should be called direct. , • ,, 14^. Since ^ H i the custom of sending Mohsals and making us pay tne cost of their keep has been forced upon us. loth We have always claimed and held the right of ownership of the pro perty of our ryots who died without heirs, but since ^nUthe Government has taken that right to itself. \Qth. Till 5 or 6 years ago there were no tolls in our districts, but they were then uniustly established'by the Gaekwar. We consider ourselves in precisely the same position as our ' Bhayad,' the Mahikanta Thakors, and that Government has no right to levy anything whatsoever from us but the ' ghas dana tribute. lllh.The nazarana on accession demanded from us was 25 per cent, on our 'ghas dana' tribute, and 40 per cent, on the giras haks. This we, Thakors, refused to pay, as no previous Gaekwar had ever demanded such a tax, and we thouo-ht Malharrao had no right to exact it. What happened to me is what occurred to the remaining Thakors, and the whole history is as follows On the Vahivatdar of Bijapur intimating to me that we had to pay this tax, I asked him to represent our grievances to the Government, and that this tax coming on the top of them, made it impossible foi'' us to pay. Tie imprisoned me and Kept me without food at Bijapur for 2 days, trying to get a promise from me to pay, and I was onlv released on agreeing to go to Baroda. I went to Baroda with the other six ' Thakors of Bijapur, and presented 2 petitions to Nana Sahib Kbanvelkar, the Prime Minister. We had no intention or wish at that time to make any disturbance or cause any outbreak. We were kept waiting on the Dewan for a month, and the only reply he would give us was, that when we had paid the accession nazarana tax, he would see about enquiring into our other grievances, through the Vahivatdar. We declined to pay nazarana, and returned to our villages. Shortly afterwards, viz. in we made a petition to the Resident, Colonel Shortt, and 3 months afterwards, having had _ no answer to that, we sent him and the Maharaj a second petition, which they took no notice of. About 2 months.after that, viz. in March 1873, my Mehta, together with Amarsinji. the Likhe Thakor, went to the Vahivatdar com plaining of the mohsals placed over us, offering to pay our usual ghas dana tribute^ and declining again to pay the accession nazarana. The Vahivatdar refused' to take our' ' ghas dana'' unless we first paid the nazarana, and said he would bring a force from Baroda to compel payment. Upon this I sent a petition to the Dewan requesting that the Vahivatdar might be confronted with us at Baroda, but we got no answer to this request, or to a similar petition we sent to the Resident. In ^ we received an order from the Sirsubha calling us to Baroda, but were afraid to go without the usual guarantee. Upon this a force was sent to Bijapur consisting of 100 Infantry, and from 1,000 to 1,500 men were also called in from the Mahals to aid them. My village is 3 kos from Bijapur, and the cultivators hearing about the force all ran away, leaving only from 200 to 300 kolis there. A proclamation was posted up in the village forbidding the ryots to give me my haks or dues, and so with the other Thakors. Four of the Gaekwar's3 ine ™ V ^n'' •^' a ^ c ^ 1 ° c ^' Harilal, Bacliar, and Pannu Mia, Jemadar, called us together at Maoda, and advised us to pay the nazarana if we did not wish to be ruined. Several 01 t le anias of Bijapur went away in fear of their lives and property. Ofmy ryots who fled only one-third have since come back, and I have suffered personal y a oss of s. *2,000 to 3,000, as they left just when the land was being* prepaiedfoi cultivation. Matters bein^ in the state above described, we, Thakors, sent a petition to the Resident at Barodain June, as well as to the Dewan, to the effect that ' the Grovernnient had sent a force against us, and wished to destroy us, that theie would be a disturbance and outbreak if the Sarkar would not do us justice, and that we should be blamed for having* caused this disturbance.' We also sent oui Kaikun Nandlal to state our case to the Sesident, and about one month afterwards, July, on the invitation of the Resident, we came to Baroda. The force was withdrawn about the .Dassera by the orders of the Government. We have been in constant attendance on the Gaekwar since we came to Baroda, but all his answer to our complaints is a demand for the nazarana. We have been to Hariba Dada Gaekwar, to the Sir Foujdar, to the High Court, and from all of them we receive the same reply, pay the nazaraua and the Inam Commission tax, and we will then see about your grievances. 2. Harisingh Dhiraji (on behalf of minor aged 6) Thakor of Gassaeta, states:— The extent of my village is about 3,000 bighas, revenue Rs. 0,000, 500 houses, and a population of some 1,500. In , the amount of my ghas dana tribute was about Rs. 1,000, but it has been gradually increased, for no other reason than that it was the Sarkar's will, to Rs. 1,500, or thereabouts. 2nd. My Sirpao allowance of Rs. 32, and Meshvani of Rs. 4, have been stop- T • Svt. 1924 ped since . 3ni My ' giras ' haks formerly extended over 10 or 12 villages, 8 or 9 being in Bijapur, 3 in Kadi. In ^ . they were cut down from Rs. 433-8-0 to Rs. 194-12-0, exclusive of my 3 Kadi villages, the amount of haks in which is still unsettled. I accepted the reduced rate till tSttsvo &gt; when the Vahivatdar took a receipt for 2 years' payment from me, but only gave me the allowance for one year, saying that the Inam Committee tax at 2 annas in the rupee for the previous 7 or 8 years had swallowed up one year's revenue. I therefore refused to take anything, and have received nothing since. 4th. The Government collects the full amount of our giras haks, but we only get the reduced sum, and the arrears which we had left uncollected at the time of the settlement we have not yet received. 5tJi. In one or two villages I was entitled to two donkey loads of pottery from each Potter, 3 seers of cotton from each Dher, and the frame-work of a grinding mill from each Sutar at the Divali, but these haks were all stopped 6th. In 4 villages I had the right of receiving the fourth of the produce, but this right too the Government has stopped since ^ . At the time of the Survey, the measurer entered 15 bighas of land at Ranasan and 15 at Vigar as Sarkari, which was really my land. The ryots falsely said the land was Sarkari, instead of mine. 7th. My giras haks in Kadi pargana, amounting to Rs. 112-8-0, have re mained unsettled for the last ten years. 8th. In my grain haks amounted to 120 maunds, when the Gaekwar's Agent commuted my allowance to cash Rs. 30. In iHr the Agent further wished to reduce this by cutting 2 annas in the rupee, and since then I have refused to take the allowance. 9th. There is a tax of 2 annas (Inam Commission tax) in the rupee upon our Wanta or Inam land which the Government takes from the actual holder. ulOth.Till ^ ^ I had authority to fine up to Rs. 200 and to inflict short terms of imprisonment, but by the Government Thanadars being employed instead of me, I lost my authority. llth. The Marriage tax grievance is the same mentioned by No. 1. 12th. The deprival of safe conduct grievance is the same as already told, and caused the imprisonment 2 years ago at Bijapur of the father of the minor Thakor. 13th. The ryots have been summoned direct since and my authority over them has thus been greatly weakened. lAth. Mohsals are imposed on us as represented by No. 1. 16th. The Government takes the property of persons dying without heirs in our villages instead of allowing us to do so. No one has died without heiis in my village since IQtJi.The only tolls in my villages are those established by myself. 17th. The story of the ' Gadi Nazarana' tax as told by No. 1, the history of our refusal to pay it, and the consequence of the said refusal, have been told by No. 1 in my hearing. His statement is correct, and applies completely to the father of the minor Thakor. 3. Jethuji Virsingh, of Ransipur, appearing by his guardian, Amarsingh Thakor of Likhe. My village comprises about:— Bighas Revenue Houses Population 3,000 Rs. 2,000 200 700 and my ' ghas dana ' tribute has been arbitrarily raised from Rs. 292 in ^. d .

I have giras haks in one village in Bijapur amounting to Rs. 10, which have not been interfered with at all except that I have not received payment since ^ , in which year I refused to take my allowances, as Government cut me 2 annas in the rupee for 8 years, and thereby deprived me of one year's income. 4:t}i. I have no other arrears except in the Kadi pargana (which See para. 7.) bth. I am not able to get payment of certain haks of mine in 5 villages of the Bijapur taluka, as the people say they have been so overburdened with Salami and Inam Committee tax, that they are quite unable to pay me my rights. 6th. Does not apply to me. 7th. I have giras haks in 2 villages of Kadi amounting to Rs. 4, which I have not received since ~ ^as they have not been settled. 8t/i. Till ^ '33 I had the right of getting 31 maunds of Bajri from Koth, but in that year the grain payment was commuted to a cash one of Rs. 15.

One man has died without near heirs; he had cousins in my village since iH, and the Gaekwar took possession of his property instead of allowing me to keep it, according to old custom. ] 6th.The only toll in my village is my own one upon grain. 17th. The story of the gadi nazarana tax, the refusal to pay it, and subse quent conduct of the Thakors and the Graekwar's Ministers is related clearly and in detail. It corresponds exactly with what has been set down in the narrative of No. 1. 4, Harisingh Jethuji, of Kuvadia, states:— My village comprises about Bighas Revenue Houses Population 1,200 Rs. 1,500 70 250 My ghas dana tribute has been raised from Rs. 246 in to Rs. 412 in , at which rate it has since remained fixed.

They were settled in by reducing them fromRs. 27 to Rs. 14-2-0, exclusive of the Kadi one, which remained unsettled. I took the reduced amount up to 2 yeai s ago, when I refused to receive it on the same grounds as those alleged by the other Thakors. 4th. I have arrears of Rs. 762 uncollected in the Bijapur pargana due from before which I cannot collect, and which the Government will not help me to collect. 6th. I had giras wanta land in 8 Bijapur villages, and 1 Kadi village, the rent of which was received by me direct from the ryots till the last 6 or 7 years, when they refused to pay me, declaring that Government, by imposing excessive Salami and Inam Committee tax prevented them from being able to do so. 6th. This does not apply to me. 7th. My giras haks in Kadi, at the rate of Rs 11-4-0 for the last 10 years, are still unpaid, owing to their never having been settled.

The gadi nazarana story, as told by Partesinghji, is true, and relates my experience of what happened. General Reply of the Durbar. 1st. We do not consider that the term -ghas dana' is correct. What is levied from the Thakors is their annual jamabandi settlement fluctuating from year to year, whereas ghas dana is a fixed payment. Some of e arors pay o ghas dana and jamabandi, and their payments on each account aro shown m sepa rate columns. It is the ordinary practice to make an annual settlement of the amount to be paid by the village for which the Thakors sign a special agreement. The increases complained of have been made with a due regard to .the State^ re quirements and the rights of the Thakors. The 15 other Thakors in this district have all paid their increased jamabandi without any trouble. Besides this, e in last August offered these very Thakors to take the average of their jamabandi for 10 preceding years, and let that be regarded as a fixed sum to be paid by them for the next ten years. 2nd. We intend not only to dear oft the arrears of Sirpao and Meshvani allowances, but also to continue tliem in full for the tuture. 4*7Srd. The ryots complained about these Thakors levying giras haks direct, and on enquiries being instituted, it appeared proper to Government to undertake the duty of collection and payment of the proper amount due to these Thakors. They say what they get now is less than what they used to levy direct, but what we pay them is the amount of what they were able to prove at the time of en quiry was really due to them from the ryots. They used to collect the giras hak from the Patels, who paid them out of the sum set apart for ' Gamkharch.' We do not collect any excess of what we pay them as giras with the view of taking the balance for Government. Ath. We have never heard of any 'arrears being due for years previous t0 Svt. 1920 J aild if any Thakor can prove to us that he has arrears due to him, he will have help to get them paid. 6th. If the Thakors apply to the proper authority, they will get what help they require. We have not stopped any of their haks. 6th. The injured man should make his complaint to the Durbar, when his case will be encjuired into, and if it is found that his private land has been wrongly entered as Government land, he will get redress. 7th. Enquiry is not completed into the Kadi pargana giras haks; when it is, the Thakors will get their dues. 8th. We are willing to take 5 years named by the Thakors, and 5 by us, and strike an average as to the amount to be paid. 9th. The land tax of 2 annas in the rupee charged by the Inam Commis sion is quite irrespective of mortgage, and is charged to the occupant thereof for the time being. 10th. Khanderao Maharaj gave the Thakors jurisdiction to fine up to Rs. 5 and to imprison for 8 days, but finding the powers abused, he withdrew them again. llth. The ' Tvatra ' or remarriage tax was a new invention of Khanderao's, which the Thakors had no right to claim any benefit from. It in no way interfered with their original marriage tax. 12th. We considered the pract : ce objectionable, and therefore abolished it* The Thakors were confined at Bijapur in consequence of their disobedience of Dur bar orders, and not in consequence of the abolition of safe conducts. 13th. It never was usual to call the ryots through the Thakors, but if the latter will undertake to produce the ryots as soon as we call for them, we have no objection to let them have this authority. 14 &lt;th. The practice complained of as to mohsals is the usual one through out the State. I.5th. We are entitled to the whole of such property, but we have no objec tion to the Thakors getting the property of such of their cultivators as die with out heirs. 16th. If there are any new tolls established since the beginning of the pre sent reign, we shall abolish them. 17th. The ' Gadinazarana' is, we admit, a new tax, but before it was levied, the Maharaj, in the beginning of 1872, spoke to the late Resident, Colonel Barr, about it, and he made no objection to its imposition. He said the Maharaj might do as seemed good to him. Similar new taxes were imposed by Khanderao Gaekwar, for instance, the ' Golden Howdah nazarana' of 2 per cent., the ' Makarpura Haveli nazarana' of 10 per cent. The Gadi nazarana is a general tax for the whole State, and has been paid by every one in it, with the exception of these 7 Thakors. Even the 15 other Tha kors of the same standing in the Bijapur Mahal have paid it without objection. r %d'V 163 9 Before sending tlie force, all ordinary means of inducing these Thakors to pay, by letters, messengers, &amp;c., were exlaausted. They defied the Government, and said they would not pay the tax unless forced to do so by an army. Troops were therefore sent as a last resource, with the concurrence of the Resident at the request of the minister. While the troops were in Bijapur, efforts were being constantly made by us to induce these Thakors, to satisfy the Durbar demands by sending messengers to treat with them at their villages, and subsequently, by tbe advice of tlae Resident, they were brought to Baroda under promise of safe conduct. Final Statement by the Resident. The case of the Bijapur Thakors, so far as it came under the knowledge of the Resident, was brought to the notice of Government in the following reports;— No. H of 25th June 1873, and accompanying yad to His Highness the Gaekwar. Also No. g^-, 28th June 1873, para. 2. Also No. i|, 4th July 1873. 2. The most important of the statements made before the Commission by the Thakors were;— 1st, That the amount of tribute payable by them had been increased gradually some 25 or 30 per cent, during the last 12 years, and that, in addition to this, the present Maharaja had taxed the increased amount with Rs. 25 per cent, on account of gadi nazarana or accession tax. 2nd. That their giras haks, &amp;c., as described in paras. 3 to 8 of the evi dence, had in every instance been either considerably reduced or had ceased altogether; and that when any remained, an Inam Committee tax of 2 annas had been imposed on the reduced amount, which nearly swallowed up the Moreover, that notwithstanding all this, in addition to the fact that their haks were in arrears for periods varying from 10 to 5 years, the present Maharaja had demanded of them a ready cash payment of 40 per cent, upon balance, all of which they considered so unjust that they declined to pay the nazarana, and consequently got into trouble about it. 2&gt;rd. That they were put to the expense of Mohsals to make them pay these extortionate demands. m.That tolls were established in their districts contrary to^ their rights; that they consider themselves in precisely the same position as their Bhayad the Mahi-Kanta Thakors. 3 The Durbar answers these specific charges in a general way, without throwing any light whatever upon the actual circumstances, which ™ W from experience cannot be ascertained excepting by detailed enquiry of the closest kind, sucli as our Giras Officers are employe o cany ou . 4. It was precisely this kind of policy, howeTer, on the part of the Gaekwar n .. -j f-rnVm-f-priM which, originally led to the transfer of the to that o/the British Government; because the latter found that their own ternt0 '% s ^^ a' hot, that the whole country was kept in a y exaot part of the Bijapur page'® of Colonel Wallace's Book on tS Tntt MlS extract ofaletJ&amp;m .«o—lule^^ U^r^ territory from which it is drawn.' ii—2 c10 5. Were tlie case of these Tliakors an isolated one, the mode of settling it would not, under ordinary circumstances, affect British interests in any way. The Resident, however, would respectfully submit that we have at the present- moment a large number of Rewa Kanta Guaranteed Girasias, and others also who hold wanta lands and giras haks in Gaekwar territory, whose interests would be affected one way or the other by the orders issued in the present case; and as the question has already been referred to Government in the last year's Rewa Kanta Administration Report, the following extract from that report is made for the purpose of reference. 6. After alluding to the 'unrestrained oppression and tyranny practised towards Rewa Kanta subjects by the Baroda local officials,' para. 277 of the report runs as follows :— 'The Durbar never lose an opportunity of snubbing one of the more power ful Rewa Kanta Chiefs, or of oppressing and encroaching on the rights of the weaker ones; and in this term all Girasias andB hay ads far as the recorde eheio, have any attempts advisers in th is course of policy. ' Para. 289. The Gaekwar's Inam Commission is a constant source of irritation and annoyance to all Girasias and Wanta holders, who have the mis fortune to own lands or wantas in His Highness's territory, and as if this was not enough, a most iniquitous practice prevails of measuring the lands admitted to be the property of Girasias by a shorter measure than the one formerly in use in that pargana. ' 290. Thus supposing a Girasia is allowed by the Gaekwar authorities to be the possessor of say 26 kumbhas of land, calculated according to a measure 13 cubits in length which has been used from time immemorial in that district, the Durbar officials at once measured off the land with the measure only 12 cubits long, assigned the much reduced parcel of land to the wretched Girasia as his batch of 26 kumbhas, and appropriated the excess, called Vadhare, to the State. ' 29]. This reduction of a single cubit in 26 kumbhas of land represents a loss to the Girasia of 65,000 square cubits. A kumbha at the former rate of 13 cubits equals 16,900 square cubits, while at the latter rate only 14,400 square cubits. ' 292. In certain villages the old standard measure was 16 cubits long, but this too has been reduced to one of 12 cubits in length, so that from the above figures Government can easily imagine how the Girasias are fleeced right and left; for there are no other words to express what goes on under that De partment of the Gaekwar's Government.' ?•_ The Resident would, in conclusion, submit, for the consideration of the Commission, that the quotations above submitted give a fair description of the system now in vogue, for the reform of which he and the Political Agent of the Rewa Kanta trust they may receive full support in disposing of the giras cases under reference.SCHEDULE 11. Cases N os. 3, and 11 to 31. 1. Hathibhai Kishorbhai, Kanbi, Matadar of Bhadran, in Petladpurgana, states There are 14 Matadars in my village. In 3 sowars and 5 sepoys came to Bhadran to levy the gadi nazarana and the Grovernment instalment of revenue. There was an old woman, widow of one Jivabhai Jeshing, who had 3 grown-up sons, who, for fear of the sepoys, ran away. The sepoys took this old woman from her house and kept her for S or 4 hours at the temple of Bhadra-Kali. Before they took her I saw them beating her at her house ; two sepoys held her by the arms, while the third struck her with a stick. Her age was 50 or 52. They did this to make her pay up the instalments and nazarana. The old woman was released and allowed to go home after 4 hours' confinement. She died on the 3rd day, I consider from the beating she got from the sepoys, who kicked her before they brought her out. The stick with which she was beaten was a bamboo as long as my arm. She did not pay the money. Only one of her sons has hitherto returned. 1 do not know where the other two are now. All the enquiry, that has been made into the case, is that on the complaint of her brother, the Patel and Mehta made a report to Petlad. A Karkun came thence, took some depo sitions, apprehended the sepoys, took them to Petlad, where they were imprison ed for 2 months by the Petlad Vahivatdar, when they were released on bail. In May last, a Karkun by name Daji Shridhar came from Petlad to levy the balance of the gadi nazarana and the revenue instalment. He took 1(3 or 15 men, of whom I was one, and placing us in a row, had a wooden beam put across our necks, and made us stand like this for half an hour. Those who then paid were then released. I paid myself and got free, but those who did not were kept in this fashion. Others also were made to stand with hands touching their toes, others holding their ears all twisted, and in a stooping posture. The Karkun remained there for 2 days, and realized about halt the gadi nazarana. About one-half is still unpaid. I made no petition a ou„ this at that time to the Vahivatdar. What was the good ? T. he mone} was paid. Should I have gained anything by petitioning ? The only petition 1 have made is that which I have made to the Resident. The oppression prac tised on us was by order of the Petlad Vahivatdar. If the Sarkar cannot get its revenue, it has been customary always to practice the a ove mo eo realizing it. The Durbar reserve cross-examination. 2. Javerbhai Dwarkadas, Patidar Patel of Sojitra, in Petlad pargana, states :—I remember coming to Baroda in on P llva ^ e usiness. eie found people from other villages in Petlad. The assessment | and they refused to pay the increased amount. In consequence of theirref one Bhavanidas, of Bamangam, a respectable man wor i 80 ' ' q seized, hand-cuffed, and made to sweep m the public roads for / WO nce his agreeing to pav the assessment demanded he was re eas . pmanded of what happened to him, other villagers also agreed to pay what was demanded of them. In - 8 ^ 192 !, in consequence of the refusal of the Bhats and Brahmans to pay the Inam Committee tax, a force of 50 sowa r s,l regiment, an ^ ojuns was sent to Sojitra. They stayed there for 6 days, an ^ some 100 or 150 people. I saw 3 me ' woun ^ -ind thence or 16 others with cuts and wounds. They took them to then tents and thence2 to Petlad where they handed them over to the Vahivatdar. Three men died in Baroda, and 3 or 4 afterwards on their return died from their wounds. In ^ the assessment was increased 2 annas in the rupee over the whole pargana, and some 500 people came to Baroda to protest against the increase. One Chagabhai,Patel of Chango, was seized in Baroda, fixed in a wooden frame-work with a beam over his neck, and his person ' spread eagled.' He was then struck twice on the breech, and at once agreed to give anything which was demanded from him. I saw this myself, and also agreed to give the increased demand. It is a common practice in levying arrears to make defaulters stand stooping in the sun, touching their toes, in water, with weights on their necks, and so on. 1 have often seen these practices in my own village. Some 25 Kanbis have left my village in the last 2 years in consequence of inability to pay their assessment. I have never given any one a bribe, nor have I had occasion to offer one. No one has ever asked one from me. The Durbar Agents defer cross-examination. 3. Javerbhai Jesabhai, 58 years, Mattadar of Sojitra, in Petlad, states : — In ^ ^ the Government sent a force of 5 guns, 50 sowars, and 1 regiment of Infantry to levy the Inam Commission tax in Sojitra. They first called on the Bhats and Brahmans to pay up, but as they refused to do so the force was quartered on us for 5 or 6' days, at the end of which time they made a night attack on the Bhat and Brahman quarter, captured about 150 persons and took them to Petlad. I saw 3 men wounded lying on cots, and some 12 or 14 others with cuts and wounds. The captives were imprisoned at Petlad for periods from 1 to 3 months, and were only released on giving security to pay the tax. Five died in jail, but none after they returned home. In conse quence of their alarm at these proceedings the rest of the people paid the tax without opposition. Two years after, in consequence of a fresh tax, the ' Ranvel vero,' being levied, some 20 or 25 Kanbis fled from the village ; some were made to stand stooping in the sun, and in similar ways made to pay. I paid myself through fear. In 1925 I saw Chagabhai, Patel of Changa, placed in a wooden frame at the Foujdari, but I donot know what was done to him, as I went away at once on getting permission to depart. I have never given any one a bribe, nor has any one even asked for one from me. The Durbar reserve cross-examination. 4. Doribhai Desabhai, Kanbi, 35 years, of Wasna, states:— In ^ a sowar came to Wasna to levy the gadi nazarana, and having made me prisoner, he kept me in custody near himself for a whole day, at the end of which I paid the tax. There was also a Koli by name Keslo, whom the sowar saddled and put a bridle on, and then mounted, and the rest of the village, being filled with fear at what had been done to him, paid the nazarana at once. The sowar was alone. No receipt was given to us for our payments. I paid for the Koli on his engaging to work for me. Ten Kolis have left the village from inability to pay their rent. The Durbar Agents defer cross-examination. 5. Girdhar Jesingh, Cultivator of Sadaina, in Petlad pargana, states : — Last Jeth (May-June) a Karkun,by name Daji Shridhar, came from the Petlad Mahal, and demanded the gadi nazarana from us. We told him we could not pay, whereupon he made some 50 of us, of whom I was one, stand on hot bricks in the sun touching our toes, and made his sepoys mount upon our*9 4( backs for 20 minutes at a time. Before making his demand he had us all as sembled in the chouri, and told us what he had come for. The sepoys fur ther went to our houses, turned the women and children out, and attached the buildings. From fear of what they were doing to us, we agreed to pay the nazarana, and gave the Karkun Rs. 7 for himself as an inducement for him to go on to the next village, and to remove the attachment. Owing to this treatment of us, Patidars, some 20 Paggis left the village for Viral in the Bor- sad taluka of Kaira. They have since returned. We have paid the gadi nazarana. We did make a petition to the Maharaj about this oppression, bat we were simply told to pay the tax and go home. The Karkun to whom we wanted to give the petition refused to take it, and told us to be olf. I do not know the Karkun's name. In answer to Durbar Agents, — How could I petition the Maharaj himself? Who would let a poor man like me into the Durbar? I do not know that there is a proclamation from the Gaekwar enjoining ryots to make complaints against any oppression exercised upon them by the Vahivatdars. 6. Desaibhai Becharbhi, Mattadar of Pallana, in Petlad, states:—I was imprisoned and fettered in Petlad for 6 days in the year because I refused to pay the gadi nazarana. My cousin Babaji was imprisoned for 14 days on the same account. On payment of 12 per cent, of the tax, my fetters were removed, and I was released. I came to Baroda, and complained in Baroda to the Fouidari Karkun Harilal, who told me the tax would be levied by instal ments I have not as yet paid the 40 per cent, demanded from holders of barkhali land. Last June, on account of the levy of this tax, some 40 people left the village. I have induced, with difficulty, about half of them to xeturn. I have made no petition to the Maharaj on this subject. Who would listen to me in the Durbar? cross-examined hy Durbar Agents.-l have no copy of my petition to Harilal. The contents of it were that I had been oppressed and ill-treated, and was unable to pay the tax. I made no petition to the Sirsuhlia. 7. Dhari Govindji, Mattadar, 70 years, of Ardhi, in Petlad pargana, states:—In the month of Jeth (June) last one Natha Bhagwandas came from Petlad to levy the gadi nazarana. I said I could not pay, and in company w th 3 other Mattadars, 1 went to Petlad to remonstrate against the to By order of the Vahivatdar, Mathurbhai, we were placed in » ^ next dav when on giving a written promise to pay Rs. 300, leleased. next day, wnen ' 0 J= wen t to the Durbar at Baroda to complain of I m company with otnei vinageib went t i the ill-treatment and oppression, but we were not listened to. made no separate petition about my own wrongs. r« answer to Durbar Agents-Oar joint petition was presented at the J ,i answer o uu -, g released, and was a protest against Palace some 15 or JU aa^s culci wc the increase of taxation, not about my personal sufferings.

In answer to Durbar Agents —I do not know whether the Rs. 50,000 was taken by Bhao Sindia himself or paid into the Government treasury. 9. Mathurbhai Dajibhai, Mattadar of Ganda, in Petlad pargana, states: In 1834 the people of the Petlad pargana were summoned to agree to a 10 years' settlement of the land revenue. The rates were excessive, and we re fused to pay them ; whereupon one of the chief men of Brahmangam was ill-treated and ordered to sweep the public roads. Being terrified at this, we agreed to the increased assessment. In ^ I was in Sojitra when the force of Artillery, Cavalry, &amp;c., came there to levy the Inam Committee tax. The Bhats and Brahmans were attacked and captured, and some 150 of them taken to Petlad. There were 15 or 20 wounded amongst them. The reason of my being in Sojitra was that the Sarkar had called me thither. Five sowars and 5 peons came to my village to levy the tax from the Kolis on account of their Salami. They beat some, tied some up to trees, and in other ways so ill-treated them, that on that very night some 200 Kolis fled into the Kaira district, where they have remained ever since. on Bhao Sindia being made Dewan, the Vahivatdar informed us that our share of the nazarana of Rs. 50,000 to be levied was Rs. 400, and on our refusing to pay it as being contrary to our 10 years' settlement, the Vahivatdar imprisoned me and 7 other Mattadars for 15 days at Petlad, and com pelled one of us, Jethabhai by name, to do hard labour. 'We paid him Rs. 400 for the nazarana and Rs. 800 for himself before we were released. 1U 2868-9 ' I was present when Chagabhai of Changa was placed in the wooden-frame at Baroda and beaten, and from fear of a similar process as regarded ourselves, we agreed to pay the 2 annas increased assessment which was demanded from us. ^ sowars and 5 peons came to realize the gadi nazarana from our village and took 50 men thence to Bhagol, where they made them stand in the sun touching their toes, and placed pieces of wood on their backs. In conse quence of this treatment the people paid the tax, and some 15 cultivators deserted the village. S4 Cross-examined hyDurbar Agents. —Complaints were not made in ||&gt; gy, and gj to the Resident about the matters set forth in those years. We petitioned the Maharaj in the Durbar at Baroda about the gadi nazarana oppiession, but we were simply told to pay and be off. Our petition was taken and read, and the answer given above recorded on it. It was the Gaekwar Malhanao IMahaiaj himself who told us to pay and go away. The petition was handed over to a sepoy, who was told to take it to the Mahal. There weie some 25 other petitioners at the time with me, and we all gave in this one geneial petition, which was disposed of as above related. The petition detailed our inability to pay, and the zulum practised upon us. 10. Trikam Jesingh, 40 years, Mattadar of Jalsan, in Petlad, states In 1873 Apru lur^ one Trimbak Hari, a Karkun of the Petlad Mahal, came to our village to levy the arrears of gadi nazarana. Finding that we could not pay, he had the villagers assembled, and choosing 5 persons, he made them touch their toes, and keeping them in this posture, he placed prickly-pear on theii backs and stones on the top of that; he kept them thus for a short time. The people weie so terrified at this, that they collected the money from wherever they could, and paid the arrears in 2 or 3 days. Four families have since run away from the village. I saw this torture practised. We reported(1^ c this matter to the Petlad Mahal, and all the answer we got was that we must pay the tax. We made no complaint to the Maharaj in Durbar at Baroda. The Durbar declined to cross-examine. 11. Narhar Gokalbhai, 35 years, Mattadar of Ganda, in Petlad pargana, states :—In the Petlad people were called to Baroda to agree to a ten- years' settlement of their revenue. They refused to pay the rates, and in consequence of this refusal, some of us, from the 4 villages of Brahmangam, Ganda, Jarali, and Mogri were imprisoned, and Bhavan, of Brahmangam, was sent to sweep the roads. In consequence of this treatment we were so frightened that we agreed to pay the assessment. In T;'- 18G5-6 I was sent for to Sojitra to pay the Inam Commission tax. I professed my inability to do so, and was confined in the thana of Sojitra for 3 or 4 hours till I agreed to pay. The same night the force of Horse, Foot, made an attack on the Brahman and Bhat quarters of the village, wounded some 15 or 20, and took 150 away to Petlad because they would not pay this tax. Next day 2 sowars and 5 footmen came to our village and beat the Kolis to make them pay the Inam Commission tax. In consequence of this some 200 or 250 families of Kolis left the village, and have since subsisted by rob bery. I have represented this to the Government 12 or 15 times, but no attention has been paid to my complaints. In ^ I was called upon to pay, with the other Mattadars, Rs. 400, as our share of a nazarana of Rs. 50,000 levied on Bhao Sindia's being made Dewan. Refusing to do this, I was imprisoned in Petlad for 15 days till I consented to pay Rs. 400, for the nazarana, and Rs. 800 for the Vahivatdar probably, as he said he would not let us out under that sum. In I came in with tlie other villages of P6tladto Baroda, to complain about the increase of 2 annas in the rupee, and saw Chagabhai of Changa tied up and beaten. In consequence of his treatment we agreed to pay. In 2 sowars and 4 or 5 peons came to levy the Inam Commission tax in our village, and in consequence of our refusal to pay, they took some 50 of us, of whom I was one, to Bhagol, where they made us stand in a row touching our toes. They kept me like this for an hour till I paid my money. T 1923 Bhadarwa brother-in-law was anxious to marry a woman of Vis- 1872' September? J •ii J ^ rarapur. He and I bringing this woman to our village were stopped by the Thanadar of Bhavanta, who said he would not let us pass unless we gave him Rs. 300. We did so, and he at once sent us up to the Petlad \ahivatdar, who demanded Rs. 500 from us as the price of his permission. We gave him Rs. 200 and his son Rs. 350 after we had been detained in custody 8 or 10 days. Shortly after we were released the woman ran away from us to Dabhol, in Borsad taluka, where she has married another man. In consequence of her running off, we have demanded our money back from the Vahivatdar ^ I1 d Thanadar, but they have refused to have anything to say to us. we have petitioned the Sir Subha and have got back Rs. 375, but the balance we bave been unable to recover. The Durbar Agents reserve cross -examination. 12. Trikam Padji, 40 years, Mattadar of Awakhal, in Sinor pargana, states:—In ^,£^7 the Vahivatdar of Sinor, Vishnu Sudaseo, came to my village to realize the gadi nazarana. He had Karkuns and Sepoys with and demanded Rs. 8,500 as our share of gadi nazarana. We said we could not pay the sum even if he took all we had down to our food. He therefore arrested the whole of the villagers, and had the hands of some 25 men tied together. I was not one of these. I was in custody. They were made to stoop, and 3 beams of wood were placed on their backs. Four men being ii—3 6 k!6 unable to bear the weight fell down, and were beaten by the sepoys. Being alarmed for ourselves, we at last agreed to pay the money, and have done so. Besides this, the Vahivatdar took a chit from us at that time for Rs. 2,800 on account of a tax of his own which he called ' Gungi.' I was kept in custody for 2 days Till such was not the custom of levying taxes or re. venue. I know that similar oppression has been practised in the villages adjoining ours. The villagers have told us so. We made up the sum by the sale of the stock of grain we had reserved for future sowings and for our own food. We made a verbal petition to the Maharaj in Durbar, stating what had been done to us, and our inability to pay the tax, but we were summarily expelled from his presence by the sepoys. Cross-examined by Durbar—If the matter is a private one, it is cus tomary to petition on 8 annas stamp paper. If it relates to zulum on the part of the Sarkar, the petition is made on plain paper. I did not make a written petition, because the Vahivatdar Bhikabhai told me that if I did not so petition he would get a remission of 2 annas in the rupee for us. 13, Parbhudas Bhukan, 52 years, Revenue Patel of Timbarva, Par- gana Shinor, states;—In the year the Vahivatdar Vishnu Sudaseo called me to Shinor, and telling me he had to recover Rs. 20,000, the amount of naza- rana which he had paid to Sivaji Khanvelkar, demanded Rs. 2,000 as the share of my village. I represented that the gadi nazarana could scarcely be paid, and how could we possibly pay this demand. He imprisoned me for 7 days in fetters till I agreed to pay. He accompanied me to the village and we called the people together. They all declined to pay, whereupon 10 of them were seized and 2 were flogged. On this the rest consented to pay the amount demanded. The village refused to pay the gadi nazarana, whereupon the Vahivatdar caused some 50 men to stand in the sun touching their toes, till at last they agreed to pay. The money has mostly been paid now. I made a written petition to the Maharaj in the Durbar on plain paper about the oppression exercised on us in the matter of the ' Gungi vero,' but my petition was thrown away by the Karkun, into whose hands we gave it, and I was driven away. We did not petition about the zulum in the second matter, because no one would hear us. We had never paid this ' Gungi' tax before. It was a tax which was to be paid, but no mention made of it. The Vahivatdar took it for himself. The Durbar Agent defers cross-examination. 14. Vardha Karshan, 22 years, Matadar of Timbarva, Pargana Shinor, states:—In 1873 Vishnu Sudaseo, the Vahivatdar of Shinor, came to Timbarva, and calling the Mattadars together, demanded Rs. 2,000 from the village. He said he had paid Rs. 20,000 himself to the Sarkar as nazarana and we must pay him back. We said we could not do it, as we had not the means, whereupon I and Mulji Narayen where seized and flogged with horsewhips, each receiving 10 cuts on the back. Upon this we agreed to pay, and Rs. 1,500 where then paid. The Vahivatdar came down to Rs. 1,600 from his original demand of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 100 is still due from me, and Mohsals are now at this very time placed over me to make me pay it. I do not know whether the Vahivatdar was going to keep the money for himself or pay it to the Durbar. We made a petition to the Maharaj, relating how this ' Gungi' tax had been levied from us by the Vahivatdar, and what he had done to us in levying it. We placed the petition in the hands of the Dewan in open Durbar. It was kept by the Durbar, but no redress has been given to us, or enquiry made in consequence of it.f&lt;r- 6 &amp; 7 The petition was one general one from us complaining, first of our hav ing been beaten, second of the illegal tax. The Durbar Agents defer cross-examination. 15. Ujam Jivan, Mattadar,PatelofKanara,in Patanpargana, states:—The gadi nazarana was levied in in oar village by the Mehta. Some 4 or 5 sepoys were sent from the thana of Dhanu, and in consequence of our refusal, from poverty, to pay this tax, some 20 men were placed in the open touching their toes, and with heavy stones on their backs for a full 3 hours. In con sequence of this treatment we agreed to pay. We sold our cattle, grain, &amp;c., and paid the tax. In that year 20 families of cultivators left our village for Viramgam in the Ahmedabad Zilla. 15 families of Kolis have also gone. No one has yet returned or will return. All the village will run off. 1 have seen similar oppressions practised in other villages all over the pargana. We did not make any petition to the Maharaj about the ' zulum ' exercised the gadi nazarana, though we did petition against the tax itself, and by order of Hariba Gaekwar, the Revenue Commissioner, I was imprisoned for 13 days in Baroda, at the end of which time I was allowed, on agreeing with Baji Patel to pay the tax in 15 days, to go home. The Durbar defer cross-examination. 16. Raichand Valji, Mattadar of Kanara, in Patan Mahal, states:—In when the gadi nazarana was levied in our village, the JVlehta brought 5 or 6 men from the Thana of Dhanu, and on our pleading inability to pay, he caused some 25 of us to stand out in the open with stones on their backs for a good 3 hours at a time. Being filled with alarm at this, we sold our cattle, our grain, &amp;c., and paid the tax. Some 20 cultivators, 15 Kolis and 5 Bharwads (shepherds), deserted the village in consequence, and have not returned. They have gone to the Viramgam taluka of Ahmedabad district, I have made no petition about this zulum. My brother Ujam did to the Maharaj in Baroda (witness No. 15). In answer to Durbar Agents. —The families left in j^ e this year, being unable to pay their revenue instalments. 17. Baji Toban, Patel of Unja, in Patan Mahal, states :— In the year some 200 Bhats were brought from different villages in the pargana to Patan to force them to pay the Inam Commission tax. I was myself in Patan on Government business connected with my own village, when one night these Bhats were attacked by the Sepoys, and 8 men and 1 woman killed. I myself saw the bodies next day. They had various wounds from swords, &amp;c., upon them. I was one of the Panch who reported on them, and our opinion was that they had died from wounds inflicted upon them. I did not see them attacked myself. To levy the gadi nazarana in my village in the y ear riiras some 50 men were made to stoop with wooden beams on their backs. Others were made to rise and fall from a standing to a sitting posture and vice versa about 100 times in rapid succession. In this way the whole of the money demanded was realized from the village. Some 200 families have fled from my village in consequence of this tax, and the oppressions practised upon them. I have made no petition about the zulum practised upon us to the Maharaj. It was practised by the Vahivatdar's men, the Thanadar and his raen. I have made personal visits and enquiries in 50 or 60 villages in the Patan District, and I find that some 2,000 families have fled the taluka from the heavy taxation and zulum practised in levying it. In answer to Durhar Agents. —The 2,000 families who have fled from the taluka are principally Kanbis. I was not personally one of the victims of oppression in my village. I saw what was done to the ryots. I do not know whether or not the Bhats had done any acts of rebellion before they ^ere attacked. The Vahivatdar did not send me to reason with these Bhats. ft8 1 ft 'Walab Lakshmidas, Patidar of Kamral, in the Khangi Mahal, states:— T n sn. 1927 j n consequence of the survey being introduced into our village, our rateT^re so raised that we were not able to pay them. The Mehta of the villaffe in order to raise the money, caused nearly every one to stand touch, ^n' his'toes, had weights placed on their backs &amp;c., and by these means the rafes were levied from the ryots. I personally was not so treated. I only j one t0 ot h e i. r yots. Some 50 families of Kanbis have left our village in coLenu 'uce° and gone to settle in the Panch Mahals, British territory. The gadinazarana was levied in g| by similar means, by turning our women and children out of their houses, by making men pull our noses and ears and so forth. We have made no petition about the various tyrannies practised upon us. The Durbar Agent reserves cross -examination. 19 Parbhu Bhaga, Kanbi of Daman, in Telade tappa of Prant Naosari, states:— If the Government demands are not paid in my village the means resorted to, to induce payment, are to make us hold our toes, to bury us m hot sand up to the knees, to put weights on our backs, to forbid us access to wells and tanks, and so forth. The gadi nazarana was paid 2 years ago m our village with difficulty by borrowing money from Sahukars, &amp;c. I myself was made 2 years ago to touch my toes and carry a brick on the back of my neck to cause me to pay my land assessment. Some 10 families have left our village in the last 2 years in consequence of similar treatment, and gone to Walor in the Surat Zillah. I made no petition about my wrongs. The Durbar Agents reserve cross -examination. 20. Rudhar Daji, Brahman, Cultivator of Veshma in Naosari, states:—In 19 ?L_ the gadi nazarana was levied'from our village by force. We, Brahmins, declining to pay, were kept in custody in the chowri for one or two days, our cattle were tied up, &amp;c. The kanbis suffered more. They were made to stand touching their toes, with stones on their backs, and so forth, and in this way the tax was levied from us. We made no petition to the Maharaj at the time about the zulum practised upon us. The Durbar reserve cross-examination. 21. Narayen Kirparam, Brahmin, Cultivator of Wadrasa, Pargana Deho-am, states:—In the month of January 1873, the Vahivatdar's Karkun, bv name Wamanrao, came to our village to collect the Inam Committee tax. My brother Nathuram Kirparam was amongst the number sent for to pay the levy, and as he could not do so at once, he and others, amounting to 13, were imprisoned. They were then, in the evening, taken to the river and made to hold their toes. They remained holding their toes all night, and in consequence of the exposure and cold, my brother Nathuram died. Upwards of 50 families from my village have run away and gone to the neighbouring districts of Ahmedabad. I made a petition to the Gaekwar about the tyranny which had been used, and he sent a Karkun named Lallubhai Desai to the village to make enquiries. From enquiries made by Lallubhai, it appeared that the allegation that my brother died in consequence of the treatment received was substantiated, and the guilt of the crime having been traced to Chababhai Desai, he was fined Rs. 1,000 by the Gaekwar and his land was also attached. The Durbar Agents decline to cross-examine. 22. Tulja Hirabhai, Patidar of Gowesar, Khangi Mahal, states-.—About two years ago, Mehta Jamnadas Bhaiji came to my village to collect the gadi nazarana cess, and all who were too poor or unable to pay, were compelled to stand in the sun holding their feet. Stones were placed on their backs and they were bent down with their weight. I was amongst those who were so treated ; and under this pressure I paid. Others were placed in the stocks9 and left there until they promised to pay. I made a petition on the subject to the Gaekwar,. but he did not give any attention, and said we must all pay our assessments, or it would be worse for us. The Gaekwar's Agents reserve cross-examination. 23. Ambaidas Morar, Patidar of Gowesar, Khangi Mahal, states: — About two years ago, one Mehta Jamadas Bhaiji came, by order of the Vahi- vatdar, to my village to collect the nazarana cess. All who refused to pay, or were unable to pay, were tortured in different manners to compel them to do so. I was myself so treated, being compelled to stand in the sun, holding my toes, and stones were also placed on my back, and at last I preferred paying to enduring more ill treatment. I orally petitioned the Maharaj, but he did not afford us any redress. The Durbar Agents reserve Cross-examination. 24. Ambaidas Harjivun, Ugratdar of Mandala, Dabhoe Pargana, states as follows;—In January or February 1873, the Vahivatdar Tatya Mahadev came to my village to realize the gadi nazarana&gt; The people had great difficulty in finding means to pay this, so stones were placed on their backs, and they were made to stand in the sun holding their toes. I was also so treated. In November or December 1872, the Vahivatdar beforementioned sent for me and told me that a ' Sadhnukri' tax of Rs. 4,000 was to be levied from my village. I asked him what this new imposition was. To this he replied, that he had to pay a nazarana of lis. 35,000 to the Sarkar to obtain his appoint ment, and that he wanted to reimburse himself. I refused to pay this large sura, on which the Vahivatdar had me seized and taken to the upper story of the house where he was lodging. I was there tortured in various ways until I gave a promise in writing on behalf of the village, to pay Rs. 1,900. Of this sum, about Rs. 1,000 have been paid and Mohsals are sent to levy the remnant. The other villagers were ill-treated to the same extent. In the same year, the same Vahivatdar ordered a cess, amounting to Rs. 225, to be levied from the Patels on account of ' Sadi choli,' that is to say, a tax levied for providing clothes to the Vahivatdar's newly married wife. This we refused to pay, until we were tortured as we had been previously. In consequence of these acts of oppression upwards of 50 families have left the village lately, and gone to reside in the Panch Mahals. To obtain some redress, we got Shankar Gela of Dhabhoe to petition the Maharaj, but we got no redress. On the contrary, Shankar himself was imprisoned by the Vahivatdar. The Durbar reserve cross-examination. 25. Shankar Ghelabhai, Patidar of Dabhoe, states as follows • In March last, I was deputed by all the villages of the Dabhoe Pargana to proceed to Baroda to complain of the tyranny which was practised in realizing the different illegal cesses imposed by the Vahivatdar, Tatya Maha dev. The forms in which he practises tyranny in the realization of the cesses are numerous, and are all within my personal knowledge, I having seen them myself. The people are made to stand in the sun with their hands touching their toes. They are bound and stones placed on their backs and they are severely beaten. I am a Desai of Dabhoe, and all the people who were oppressed have confidence in me, knowing that I am acquainted with all their hardships. This was the reason I was selected to lay their hard case before the Maharaj. On presenting my petition in the Gaekwar s Durbar to His Highness, he paid no attention to me, and the sepoys drew me away from the kacheri. Afterwards, as a punishment to me for having presented the petition, the Vahivatdar confined me for three days in his house, from which however I contrived to escape. n—3 c J Aj10 The Durbar reserve cross-examination. 26. Virchand Lila, Patidar of CJmta, Kheralu Pargana, states The rates of assessment have been repeatedly raised of late in my village, and improper cesses have been imposed. In 1867-68, a Karkun named Mama Saheb came to the village, and because we would not pay, all sorts of oppression were practised on us ; we had to stand in the sun touching our toes with our hands; stones were placed on our backs ; we were beaten, bound, and otherwise ill- treated. At that time Baba Saheb Sarshi was Vahivatdar. He was succeeded by Bandu Saheb, and we were still tortured when we could not pay the cess. In consequence of this ill-treatment, upwards of 50 villagers have deserted their homes and gone into neighbouring districts. I petitioned the Gaekwar repeatedly about the tyranny which was practised on us, but never got any redress. The Durbar reserve cross-examination. Reply of the Durbar to the Petlad and other parganas' complaints of oppression in levying the revenue and taxes. We are not prepared either to admit or deny the allegations made by witnesses regarding the oppression to which they say they were subjected. We do not know the names of the persons who, these witnesses say, were subjected to oppressive treatment. Under these circumstances, we could only adduce evidence of a gerferal character to show that zulum was never resorted to as a system. This evidence the President considers, being of a negative character, cannot invalidate the positive facts deposed to by the witnesses. In deference to this opinion we do not urge to be permitted to adduce evi dence of that kind. Looking at the class to which the witnesses belong, and their position, our impression is that their description of torture is at least considerably exaggerated, if not totally false. The probable truth is that when they refused to pay the dues of the State, they were kept in confinement for short terms, with a view to enforce the payments. However, if anything beyond this 'did really happen, which we are not prepared to admit, it was without our sanction. The rules in force do not permit that procedure, while a general circular was issued in February, distinctly prohibiting the exercise of any kind of zulum on any person. Our conduct has been in per fect harmony with the spirit of these Circular Orders ; and whenever cases of oppression come to the notice of the Durbar, regular enquiries are made, and the guilty parties punished. The assessments having been fixed for a term often years, at a time when high prices prevailed, may appear to be high at the present time, but as the ten years' term will shortly expire, a fresh assessment will be made according to the circumstances of the cultivators. With regard to the nazaranas generally, they were levied in accordance with previous custom, and the gadi nazarana specially was levied with the knowledge of the late Resident Colonel Barr, The Bhats of Patan are naturally ill-disposed to Government, and were called upon to give security to keep the peace. They declined to give it and went about from village to village committing self-immolation, ' traga, ' even killing their own associates. The Government people killed none of them. When they came to Patan, the Government tried to arrest them, and they again committed this ' traga/' but the Government officials killed none of them as alleged. With reference to the Sojitra Bhats and Brahmans, they refused to pay the Inam Committee tax, and were turning people against Government. A company of 100 soldiers, with one gun, were sent to arrest them. They brought 12 of the ringleaders into Baroda, where they were tried and sen-11 tenced to imprisonment. While in jail, three or four of them died, but from natural causes. Malharrao Maharaj has exempted Bhats and Brahmans from paying the Inam Commission tax. Translation ofCircular Order issued by the Durbar of His Highness Malharrao. No. 314. Circular from the Chief Fouzdari Officer at Baroda, to all Vahivatdars in Petlad Mahal. It has come to the notice of His Highness the Maharaj that in the Mahals of His Highness's territory certain Government Officers, Vahivatdars, Thanadars, Fouzdars, Karkuns, Mehtas, Mukhis, Jameedars, c^-c., exercise, in virtue of their official position, oppression towards the ryots, and also use violence to them in collecting the Government dues by exacting forced labour and in other ways for their own benefit, the result being that the ryots suffer from this oppression. The following instance of this sort having recently occurred in the village of Wadwas, in Dehgam pargana, to the effect that one Amin Chababhai Desaibhai used tyranny and violence, contrary to law and justice, to a Brahmin, a resident of that place, an enquiry was made, in the Fouzdari Department, at head-quarters, and the charge having been proved against, the said Amin, he has been appropriately punished. Further be it known that the following order has now been issued, cau tioning all officers concerned, to the effect that if similar instances of oppress ing the ryots be hereafter found to have been practised by any officer for his own benefit by misuse of his official power, or if instances of corruption come to the knowledge of Government, and are proved against any officer. His Highness the Maharaj will punish him, irrespective of what his position or rank may be. This Circular has been issued by order of the Maharaja, and you are direct ed to see that these instructions are fully carried out. An acknowledgment of this Circular should be sent within four days. Dated this - Iag \LtFebraa!y''i'73 8 (Signed) BALWANTRAO ESHWANT. Final Statement by the Resident. Schedule II., Cases 3, 6, and from 11 to 31, both inclusive. Also No. 65, relative to the prevention of Naosari people from attending the Commission and their persecution by Durbar officials. 1874. The evidence which I was prepared to submit to the Commission regard ing the maladministration of the Revenue Department of the Gaekwar State was not recorded owing to the orders received from the Government of India prohibiting any enquiry into the details of the Revenue system of the Gaekwar State. The Petlad pargana of 90 villages was represented at Baroda by the chief men and ryots of 83 villages; indeed, every district was well represented except Naosari, only a few of the ryots and patels of which managed to elude the vigilance of the district officials, who, notwithstanding the Durbar's assertions to the contrary, exerted themselves to the utmost to prevent them from coming to Baroda. ftmm ill * The original claim of Bhanabhai Lalbhai, the Boun dary Pillar Contractor, No. 7 of Schedule III., was rejected in connection with this Survey. 12 The details of this, as also the persecution of several persons who had come to Baroda to complain, and had fled into the Surat Collectorate, as re ported by Mr. Hope, will be found under Case 65 of Schedule II. I have reason to know that the officials of Naosari and their relatives at Court particularly dread the consequences of an enquiry into its revenue administration, because the entire system, including the Revenue Survey* itself, is said to be as fraudu lent in respect to the Gaekwar State, as it is tyranni cal with regard to the people ; and the real question is, whether this state of affairs is confined to Naosari ? I believe not. Although the main cause of discontent amongst the landholders and agricultural classes of the whole State has not been directly inquired into, yet it is submitted that the evidence recorded by the Commission of the forcible means which have been systematically used everywhere by the Durbar to collect its revenue, affords undoubted proof of over-taxation to an oppressive extent, because it is not rea- f The Durbar, in speaking slightingly of the position of sonable to suppose, that ifj' these people, condemn themselves. Every man examined was respectable persons like those a Matadar or a Patel, the heads, in fact, of agricultural classes. lin J pr pvam ; nflt ; OT1 had it in Moreover, all these persons have incurred extreme risk by U i n( ! er examination, naci It in coming forward. their power to pay the Crovern- ment demands, they would year after year, for the last 8 or 9 years, have incurred torture, imprisonment, and every kind of annoyance by obstinately refusing to meet them. The Durbar, indeed, in their reply of the 18th December, instead pf fac ing the difficulty and promising reform, attempt to show that if there is any thing wrong they are not responsible for it. They state—- That they are not prepared to the evidence recorded, because they do not know the names of the persons^ subjected to oppressive treatment, and that such was not systematic. 2. They then contradict themselves by saying that the description of torture given is at least considerably exaggerated, if 3. That such tyranny is contrary to a general Circular § issued by them , m. • • , n- i i n February 1873. § This is merely a Circular J ^ addressed to the' Vahivatdar 4. That the gadi nazarana was levied with the Petiad Mahal, and is not a knowledge of the late Resident, Colonel Barr, general one. , , , „ -r-» , -n i i 5. That the Bhats of Patan were not killed by Government sepoys, but immolated themselves. 6. That the Sojitra Bhats and Brahmans, against whom a Military force was sent, refused to pay the Inam Committee tax, and were turning people against the Government, and that only three or four of them died, but from natural causes, not from their wounds. 7. That with respect to the Naosari business, to prevent persons from coming to complain, and they evade altogether the circumstances reported by Mr. Hope. In these and other replies given to the Commission of late, the Durbar would make it appear that there is little or no room for reform in the matters investigated. The briefest possible glance, however, at the evidence itself will, it is submitted, show the contrary. For instance— Witness No. 1 describes the circumstances under which an old widow died from ill-treatment by Government sepoys, simply because her three sons had deserted the village through inability to pay the taxes demanded of them. 1. X Not?, —Every witness gives specific instances. r13 Also that in May 1873 oneKarkun Daji Shridar, tortured the witness and 10 01 . i5 others, till they paid the gadi nazarana. Witness No. 2 cites case of Bhavandas, of Brahmangam, also the Sojitra also case of Chhagabhai, Patel of Changa, tortured at Baroda; 25 Kanbis deserted the village. Witness No. 3 confirms foregoing. Witness No. 4 cites the case of a Koli named Kasra; ten Kolis deserted the place. Witness No. 5 cites the case of the same Karkun, Daji Shridhar, as above, i 0 tortured 40 or 50 men, all of whom, if alive, would be forthcoming, and so on in every instance, specific cases are cited which could easily have been verified by the Durbar had they chosen to take the trouble to do so,—thus the excuse that they do not know the names, and that the torture was not syste matic, moreover, that the whole account is exaggerated, if not totally false, is disproved, not only by the 26 representative witnesses in this case, but by the collateral evidence of the Patau and Visnagar torture cases, Seiad Sadak Ali's case which show that not only in the Revenue but in the Police and Judicial Departments also torture is practised in a systematic manner to extort revenue agreements, collect revenue, extort money, confessions, raji- namas, and acquittances of every kind ; in short, there is scarcely a cas e or a transaction even amongst those which have been brought before the Com mission, in which the system is not enforced in some shape or other. Had the details of the revenue administration been gone into, the reasons for employing torture would become apparent, inasmuch as what with the ex cessive assessment, numerous cesses, unauthorised levies by Vahivatdars, and others, desertion of homes, nazarana, short measurement of land, encroach ment on giras lands and haks, forced labour, the agncu tuia classes are thoroughly pauperised, and their condition about as hopeless an one as it can well be. With regard to the Circular of February 1873 which the Durbar in their reply call a general one it is not so, it having been addressed to t e et ac Vahivatdars alone, who have evidently taken good care to keep it to lem- selves. Moreover, it will be seen by the evidence of several witnesses, la ie y were turned away by the Maharaja himself, when they came to comp am a ou the oppression committed in connection with the levy of gadi nazaiana an other cesses ; e. sr., witness No. 7, who is the chief nian of e vi age o Ardi, in Petlad, with three other Matadars, went to the Vahivatdar to complain and were confined by him in a privy till they promised to pay 300 rupees, i hey also failed to obtain redress from the Durbar for this instance of oppression, which, I have reason to know, is by no means uncommon m the Gaekwar Mate. There is also the instance of witness No. 25, who in March last, immediately after the date of this Circular, was removed from the Maharaja s presence un- heard, although he went to complain against the oppression of the Vahivatdar. In fact, the system of farming out Vahivatdarships ancl other offices, judicial and executive, initiated, by the present administration.t g with the prevalence of bribery and corruption, fostered the jery aWs which the Circular was supposed to suppress, and thus^it will continue to in this unfortunate State so long as the present administration power. , , With regard to the Bhats of Patan, even if they did lation, as stated by the Durbar, which is not boine outby 5 m t i,„ ^whatever, they were driven to it by the treatment ley re ^ eive , Durbar officials. This, however, and the Sojitra case, are matters of history, the real facts of which cannot be controverted, and can be swoio to y hundreds of people, n—3 a14 Finally, with reference to the Durbar's assertion that whenever cases of oppression are brought to His Highness's notice, enquiries are made, and the guilty parties punished. I beg to say that in my own experience it depends upon who the guilty parties are, as to whether any notice at all is taken of the case, or punishment awarded, inasmuch as I can quote agreat number of in stances in which justice has not been done, and the guilty parties have escaped. Indeed, as one instance I quote the whole of the circumstances set forth in case 65, Schedule II., regarding Naosari, which has been evasively dealt with by the Durbar, when they say in their reply to the Commission that they issued no order to prevent persons coming to Baroda to complain. If this be true, why have they not replied to my letter of oth December up to the pre sent moment, and why were not the persons produced between that time and the date of the departure of the Commission, as they well might have been ? Instead of this, those who had come to Baroda and returned home, were per- secuted and driven out of their homes, they had come to Baroda to complain. These cases are still pending. The question of disturbances in British territory in connection with the state of affairs in the Petlad and Kadi parganas has already been dwelt upon in the Administration Report for 1872-73.SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 4. 2, Jethabhni Dallabhai, Leva Kanbi, 51 years, of Piz, in Petlad Malial, gj-^g : In 1 agreed to take the vain vat of the Klieiralu Malial for 5 years. The revenue is over 2 lakhs of rupees, and I promised to pay Rs. 1,000 annually m ore than had been levied in the previous year. This Rs. 1,000 was to be realized from ryots who had unauthorizedly cultivated land, and who held waste land without paying for it. I paid Rs. 10,000 to Nana Sahib to induce him to wive me the vahivat. The sum was to be paid in one year in consideration of my having the office for the five following years. I paid Rs. 5,000 in cash at once and Rs. 5,000 in two or three months afterwards. On the first occasion were pre sent a number of people. I gave the money to be counted to the Nana Sahib's Jemadar. There was no entry made in any account book, nor did I get a receipt for my money. I paid Rs. 4,000 on the second occasion, and Rs. 1,000 on a third occasion, when I got my quittance from Nana Sahib. I went to my Mahal the fifth day after this, and remained there 6 or 7 months, realising the Government revenue. In June last, I got a notice from the Government that a new Vahivat- dar was appointed over me, and directing me to proceed to Baroda. I came in at once, and tried to get an explanation from the Nana Sahib, but he kept putting me off day after day with excuses of sorts for 2 or 2| months, till I made my com plaint to the Resident, as no one else would listen to me. The reason of my offering the Rs. 10,000 ■' sukdi' was from my knowing it was the usual custom in the State. The Durbar reserve cross-examination. The complainant makes a further statement before the Commission to the following effect: — In addition to the Rs. 10,000, which I said yesterday I ^gave to Nana Sahib, I also gave Rs. 1,500 to one Narayenbhai, the Sirsubha s Karkun, an Rs. 500 to one Gropalrao, the Nana Sahib's Karkun, the vakil of the Petlad Maia . I had intended to mention this yesterday, and believed I had done so, but it appears not to have been taken down. Gross-examined by Durbar Agents— The signature on the Karar (agreement) shown to me is mine, but 1 do not know what is written in it, as I do not now Modi (Marathi). The term in the written agreement is one year, hnt 1 under stood I was to have it for 5 years. I distinctly understood that this agreement, though passed only for one year, was to be renewed annually for 5 wien paid in the yearly revenue at Baroda. I forgot to mention the s . pai o Gopalrao in my original petition to the Resident. It was written has i y, anc did not remember that item at the time. No complaint, so fai as enow, las been made against me in the Durbar since I was Valiivatdar. The ur oai as no informed me that such complaints have been made. It is specified m the agree ment that I am not to levy any extra taxes from the ryots. Statement of the Durbar. 1st. The lease of the Mahal was given to complainant for one year only, at the end of which time his successor was appointed. 2nd. That in consequence of communications, both verbal and written, between the Maharaj and the Resident, the complainant was repeatedly summo- e d, through the Resident, to appear before H. H. the Gaekwar, wi i ie p ii—42 of his complaints, but that in consequence of his failing to do so, his case has not been enquired into. 3rd. That he has embezzled public money, and has not given m the accounts of his Mahal. 4(72,. That there are now pending against him before the Durbar several charges of bribery and oppression. §th. That though directed to proceed to his Mahal to give over charge to his successor, he has not done so. Final Statement by the Eesident. The petitioner complains that after making an agreement with the Minister to manage the Kheiralu Mahal for five years, and after paying the Minister as a nazarana Rs. 10,000 for the privilege, besides nazaranas of Rs. 1,500 to Naravenbhai, the Deputy Sir Suba, and Rs. 500 to Gopalrao, the Minister s Vakil, he had been deprived of his management after a few months, i he Durbar deny that the Mahal was let for more than one year, but it_ is noticeable that the petitioner was not left in charge even for this short period. Moreover the fact of bribery is not affected by such a question one way or other With reference to clause 2 of the Durbar's explanation, it may be reraar ed t iat had the petitioner obtained from the Durbar any reasonable hope of a settlement of his case, it is most improbable that he would not have availed himseli 01 the opportunity. The petitioner, however, states that for upwards of two months he was in constant attendance on the Minister, 'trying to get a hearing, and that he was induced to appeal to the Resident as a last resource. The Resident s reasons for not sending this case up to the Durbar after some time had elapsed aie fully stated in his letter to Government No. dated 18th September 1873. Statements 3, 4, and 5 are irrelevant; besides, the Resident is aware that when this case was first reported, attempts were made to buy off the petitioner. The Resident respectfully submits that his chief object in bringing forward the case was, to illustrate and reform the most pernicious practice of the Minister of a State, and the revenue officials, trading in high civil and judicial appoint ments of this kind. There can be no doubt that this system of farming the Mahals on payment of heavy nazaranas is a system generally prevalent throughout the whole of the Baroda District, and has been carried to excess during the present administration. Hence the petitioner and others of this class have been induced to run heavily into debt, under promises that they would secure a five-years tenure of an appointment by paying a certain amount, in several instances like the present, these promises have been broken, the bribe retained, and the purchaser of the appointment ruined. Whether such conduct is becoming the character of a Prime Minister, and whether those who have committed such crimes ought not to be advised to restore what they have taken as a warning to others, are ques tions of reform which it would appear desirable to suggest for such a State as Baroda, because it appears to be no advance whatever in that cause for high officials to say that they are sorry for certain offences against their own laws, when at the same time they are allowed to retain their ill-gotten gains and enjoy them, whilst their victims are sent to jail.SCHEDULE IT. C ase N o. 9. 1. Vela Uma, Koli, 22 years, Matadar of Jagral, in Patan, states:—Some 20 days after last Divali, the Fouzdar, Fateb. Ram, came to our village, and accusing rue of the theft of some gold bricks and silver chains, took me to the chowri and had my house searched. Nothing was found therein. I represented that the complaint was made against me through enmity, as I was the Matadar, but that I knew nothing of it, I was taken by him the same day to the Wagrol thana, where my hands were tied behind my back, and I was suspended in this state to a ' nimb ' tree. I was then beaten by his orders over the body and arms by a Jamadar and Sepoy. I show the marks of the flogging on my person now. I was beaten on 3 occasions. On the last occasion the Thana Karkun Eaghunath called on me to confess. I was so worn out by constant floggings that I said I had given the gold bricks to a Vania by name Chagan. What I then stated was false; I did not steal the bricks; I never gave them to Ohagan; and I knew nothing about the matter at all. In consequence of what I said, Chagan was seized and beaten by the Police in the same way as I had been. One Balla Bhat was also similarly beaten. I did not mention his name, which was given to the Fouzdar by the same person who had mentioned mine I suppose. I was kept in custody at Waghrol for 5 days after I was beaten, and was then taken to Patan, where I was further confined for 2 days, and was only released on my signing a paper to the effect that I had not been beaten or ill-treated. The Bhat Balla made a petition by post to the Durbar which I agreed to. I do not know of any enquiry having been made or punishment inflicted by the Durbar in consequence of our petition. Statement of the Durbar. There is no doubt that the Fouzdar has committed ' zulum.' The case has been enquired into by the Durbar on receipt of petitioner's complaint direct; he has been arrested, suspended, brought in here, and the case has been clearly proved against him. He has been released on bail after reference made to the Resident, and we are only waiting for this complainant to come up to sentence this Fouzdar and Raghunath. S chedule II.—C ase No. 10. 2. Balvant Mehru of Jagral and Chagan make similar statements to the preceding complaint, and the Durbar reply in the same way that they were un justly and improperly beaten by the Fouzdar in the case, and that the enquny having been completed, the charge is proved, and the Fouzdar is awaiting punis ment. Final Statement by the Resident. S chedule II.—C ases 9 and 10. The facts of this very serious case have been only partially elicited by the brief examination of three witnesses before the Commission. The Durbar ave, however, admitted the guilt of the chief criminals Fattehram Fouzdar, and of Ins accomplice Raghunath, and have expressed an intention of punishing them. n—90 In order, liowever, that the Commission may have an opportunity of forming a fair opinion (1) regarding the gravity of the crime committed and (2) regarcl- ino- the actions of the Durbar officials with reference to this crime, the Resident would respectfully invite the attention of the Commission to the petitions ot relatives of two of the sufferers, which were forwarded to Government with Endorsements Nos. 197-933 and 198-934 of October 14th, 1873. The Resident respectfully submits that these petitions contain a substantially true account of this very serious case. It will be seen from these petitions that the torture inflicted was of a brutal and revolting kind, and that two unfortunate w om.en&gt; named Amba and Gulab, were also subjected to cruel and unmerciful flog ging in public kacheri. The following is a list of the sufferers m the case . 1. Velia Uma Koli Matadar. 2. Chhagan Dulechand, Bania. 3. Balvant Meru, Bhat. 4. Bhaiji Meru, Bbat. 5. Parbhudas Parsotam, Bhat. 6. Tribhovan Bhathi, Bhat. 1'! Women of the Bhat caste. 8. Gulab j The character of the injuries inflicted on these persons is fully described in the petitions referred to, and have been substantiated orally before me. Commission will not fail to observe that at the time of their investigation, De cember 5th, four of the chief sufferers, viz., Chhagan Dulechand, Bhaiji Meru,_ and the tivo women, were never produced by the Durbar, although on two occasions, viz., November Stli and November tlie Durbar liad been advised by the Re- side'nt to produce all these persons for examination before the Commission. It was stated, however, that one of these witnesses, named Chhagan Dulechand, was still so ill from the injuries which he had received, that he was unable to attend. The main points in the case to which the attention of the Commission is respectfully invited, are as follows:— ] st. The flogging of women and men in public kacheri without any legal sentence or order of a competent Court. •2nd. The motive for which the flogging was inflicted, viz., to extort confession. 3rd.The position of the Officer by whom the flogging was inflicted, viz., the chief criminal authority of the district. 4th. The indiscriminate nature of the torture inflicted ; eight persons being similarly treated. Uh. The infliction of torture on a British subject named Parbhudas Par sotam. In forming an opinion on the gravity of the case, the Commission will not fail to bear in mind, that the case is not an ordinary case of Police torture, which might occur in any district even under the best regulations. In the present case the petitioners represent not only that no crime had been committed, but that no person had even come forward to complain. The torture is stated to have been merely a device for squeezing money out of persons who were supposed to possess money. The case, moreover, must not be considered as an isolated case of torture. In the case of the goldsmith Kasiram Ambaram, ISTo. 44 of this Schedule, precisely similar violence was inflicted, and in that case also is alleged to have been one of the victims, and to have died from the injuries whichshe received. This case ^ also occurred in the Patau District. The Commission ao-ain will not fail to bear in mind the case of the woman Baini, who was tortured in Visnagar in order to extort confession of a crime which she had never com mitted-—vide case No. 41 of this Schedule. Also case No. 39 of this Schedule, in which 8 persons were alleged to have been publicly flogged in order to extort confession of crime which there is good reason for believing had never occurred. This case, in connection with several others that have been presented to the notice of the Commission, establishes the following facts :— 1. That torture is employed in the Baroda District to extort confession^. 2. That this crime is practised not only by subordinates, but by the chief criminal authorities of the district. 3. That even women are subjected to this torture in places set apart for the administration of public justice./ SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 32. General attachment of Vatans throughout the Baroda State. The Durbar Agents admit that all vatans were attached by the late Khanderao Maharaj, pending enquiry, about 8 or 10 years ago, and state that His Highness Malharrao Maharaj has issued a proclamation declaring that the attachment of all these vatans has been withdrawn, and the parties entitled thereto permitted to enjoy them as heretofore, until their right to them has been formally adjudicated, to admit of which they are called upon to produce their proofs within 12 months from the date of the proclamation, viz., 3rd November 1873. Final Statement by the Resident. The admission by the Durbar that all vatans were attached by the late Khanderao Maharaj, pending enquiry, about 8 or 10 years ago, speaks for itself. No explanation whatever has been assigned for the delay in commenc- ing the enquiry, and it will be observed from the date of the proclamation recently issued on November 3rd, that the presence of the Commission alone has induced the Durbar to take any action in the matter at all. The Vatandars themselves regard the attachment as a mere pretext for spoliation, and have no confidence whatever in the conduct of the proposed enquiry. When it is remembered that the titles of these Vatandars are more ancient than that of the Gaekwar himself, it may be admitted that the fears of the Vatandars are not groundless. The general confiscation ot Inams, and the spoliation of all classes in the Baroda State by the piesent Administration, is a fact which speaks for itself, and has aroused the greatest alarm and discontent. n—32/ SCHEDULE II. C ase N o, 35. Shaha Sah-eh Usman-khan, Musaiman, Fakir of Madras, states:—I came to Baroda between two and three years ago, and lived at a Dharmsala near tbe station. I used to write to a newspaper ' A-khbai 5 published st IvEiTipiirci. I got no money from the paper, only a, copy of it. I sent general news of matters which I saw occurring under my own eyes. I wrote nothing against the Government or Maharaj. I did men tion instances of zulum which I saw; for instance, about two Brahmans, one of whom I saw run over by one of the Gaekwar's carriages. Both he and his companion weie taken up. I also mentioned about cartmen having their carts seized and sold by the Government. A doctor who had a quarrel with me informed the Government of my writing to the paper, and one day, about eleven months ago, a Karkun and two Sepoys arrested me, and took me to the Fouzdari. I was taken before one Chaganlal and my deposition written. was asked my name, residence, &amp;c., and whether I had written to the paper. On my admitting that I had done so, I was taken off to jail. I was not told what my sentence was, but I saw the warrant which the sepoy was carrying, and in it I read that I was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment, Rs. 1,000 fine, in default of payment 5 years' further imprisonment. I cannot read Mahrathi. I can Guzerati if it is well written or printed. Xhe warrant was in Guzerati. The deposition of one Nathoo Patel was also taken, but it did not relate to my writing to the newspapers for which I understood 1 was punished as above. I was confined for 9 months, and was then re leased on Nathu petitioning the Resident, at whose instance I was dis charged. At the time of my original arrest, my property, consisting of books, clothes, silk threads, &amp;c., value about Rs. 25, was taken possession of, and on my release a sum of Rs. 4 for which my things had been sold by auction, was given to me, together with Rs. 2 to pay for my ticket to Bombay. A sepoy was sent with me to the Station, and I was ordered to start by the first train. I did not take a ticket. I merely got a platform pass, and thus eluded the sepoy. I concealed myself for that day (Sunday), and next day went to the Resident to pay my respects to him, and to tell him my story. He gave me a pass authorizing me to remain in Baroda. About days ago, I went dow.n to the river here to bathe, and was arrested by 2 sepoys, who would not pay any attention to my pass. They conducted me out of Gaekwari territory^ and told me that if I were found again in Baroda, I should be imprisoned. I have since been living at Sitpan Tankaria, in the Broach District, and only came up here last night. The Durbar Agents decline to cross-examine, but promise to make a statement about the case. Recalled, states in reply to the Durbar. I recognize the two signatures on the two Guzerati papers now shown to me, as mine. All the five papers written in the Urdu character now shown to me were written by me, and were found in my house when I was arrested. The third signature on the receipt shown to me is also mine. Statement of the Durbar. There has been a regular enquiry into this case. The papers now produced, which complainant admits were written by him, show the libellous nature of the letters which he wrote to the newspaper, and disclose an offence against ii—35the Gaekwar personally, as well as against h « ^vernment Consequently thp Dunishment was twelve years'imprisonment. He was released on tne reeommenTationofthe Resident that he should be turned out of Gaekwar s We deny that we sent any Sepoys to expel him from Gaekwar territory after he got the Resident's pass, as alleged by him We show the com- plainant's receipt for all his property which was given to bun on bis release. The signature is admitted by him. Lastly, we consider him to be a subject of the Gaekwar's Government, and the Government was therefore justified in the action it too . The Durbar produce certain letters found in the complainant s house written in Urdu to the Editor of ' The and ac- knowledged by the complainant to be in his handwriting. These being read by the Nawab Saheb Faiz Ali Khan one of the Com mission are found to be a series of foul personal attacks of the most gross nature upon the Maharaj personally.SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 37. Maganbhai Parshotam, 18 years, Head of the Firm of Hari Bhagti, of Baroda, Surat, and Ahmedabad, states:—In » Khanderao Maharaj took from my mother, my father being dead, a chit for the sum of 20 lakhs of Rupees, which, on the assertion of one of the Gumashtas of the firm, Pitambar by name, he declared to be due to the State from us. I am the adopted son of Par shotam, and was at that time a child. Out of the sum 6 lakhs were paid, but some 5 or 6 years after, on proof being adduced that the money was not due, Khanderao said that the balance of 14 lakhs was not to be paid, and that the 6 lakhs should be refunded. He lived for 1| or 2 years after this, but did not refund the 6 lakhs nor restore the chit. Malharrao has given back the chit, but not the 6 lakhs. At the time of my adoption by Parshotam the sum of 5 lakhs was paid as nazarana to the State, and entered in the books of the firm. Some few months after Parshotam's death, the sum of Rs. 75,000 was lent to Malharrao as a private transaction. He had not then ascended the throne. Immediately after his accession he sent our Gumashta Girdhar Trikam who had been imposed on us by Khanderao to demand a quittance for this sum of Rs. 75,000. I refused to give this, but that night, about 8 p. m ., when I was asleep, Girdhar came again, and informed me that it was the will and pleasure of the Maharaj that I should give this quittance, and that I had no choice in the matter. Under these circumstances, I gave the quittance without having received anything in return. Some 7 or 8 months ago, Malharrao Maharaj sent Girdhar again with a Jasod,' Government messenger, and asked to see some diamond ornaments. I sent some including a necklace ; that evening Balvantrao Raholkar came and asked to see some of my best jewels for the Maharaj. He selected four or five which he took away with him and which the Maharaj approving them kept. I don't know their value. They consisted of earrings, necklace, &amp;c. His Highness Malharrao gave me a 'poshak,' ornamental dress, worth some Rs. 50, and presented Girdhar with a pearl necklace. He also gave me back the chit for 20 lakhs of rupees mentioned above. At the time of the Divali in 1872, the Maharaj asked for my emerald necklace, valued at some 4 or 5 lakhs of rupees. It was at that time mortgaged to the Killedar for Ks. 75,000, and to enable me to redeem this mortgage the Government lent me 2^ lakhs. Of this amount Rs. 16,000 has been since paid off. I got back the necklace from the Killedar, and about a month afterwards Wasant Rambhao came and asked for it for His Highness. The key of the box in which it was kept not being forthcoming, a blacksmith was sent for, the box broken open, and the necklace taken away. I went with Wasant to the palace, but the Maharaj being asleep I was not admitted, and had to return home. Next day, when I went to pav my respects to the Maharaj, he was wearing the necklace. He received me well, and at my request he promised to give me Government aid in recovering debts due from different people in Baroda. About the time of the Divali, the Maharaj took away from my house a valuable chandelier and clock. In making up our accounts at that time, I was compelled, after much discussion, to credit the Government with Rs. 25,000 on account of one Gordhan Xrikam being made cashier to Government, this sum hav ing been promised to him by my Gumashta Girdhar to be paid if he got , ■*- *j * i * i. 'TIT Svt. JyiS the place. It was done without my consent and against my wuf. in a .d. ia7i n—37 afour Inam villages, together with cash allowances, aggregating Rs. 20,000 and a garden of ours in Baroda was attached by the Gaekwar. We have still to pay the cost of keeping up this garden, but H. H. Malharrao keeps it for his Mistress Radhabae. The complainant produces several sanads granting his family the villages which were attached. The Durbar Agents admit the genuineness thereof. The Durbar Agents have no cross-examination to make, and defer their statement. Reply of Durbar. Maganbhai's mother passed a bond to H. H. Khanderao for 20 lakhs in settlement of old debts due to the State, and in part payment thereof gave 6 lakhs. There is no record of H. H. Khanderao having given any order to return this bond to the complainant, or in other words to cancel it. On the contrary, on the representation of complainant's Munim, Girdhar Trikam, the Durbar was induced to return this bond to complainant to prevent the old firm of Hari Bhagti from being totally ruined. On this occasion the complainant presented a nazarana of an emerald necklace and five other ornaments, a garden called Nao lakhi, cash Rs. 25,000, &amp;c. The deed of release for Rs. 7?,000 was given voluntarily. The.levy of a nazarana of 5 lakhs by H. H. Khanderao on the occasion of Maganlal's adoption was made in conformity with prevailing custom. H. H. Khanderao appointed Girdhar Trikam as Munim to conduct the affairs of the firm during complainant's minority. Complainant voluntarily offered a nazarana of Rs. 75,000, if he was allowed to remove the Munim. He passed a bond for that amount and Girdhar was accordingly removed. Complainant, however, soon afterwards, applied for the services of the same Munim, as the affairs of the firm could not be well conducted without him. His application was made through the late DewanGopalrao Myral, and Girdhar was re-appointed. The complainant protests against the resumption of his villages and the stoppage of his allowances in the month of Bhadrapad ~; but all debts owing to bankers having been cleared off, there was no reason to continue these grants. Final Statement by the Resident. Maganbhai Parshotam, representative of the firm of Hari Bhagti. 1874. The Resident respectfully submits that the explanation of the Durbar in this very serious case is altogether inadequate and unsatisfactory. The substance of the petitioner's complaints may be summarized as follows:— 1st.That the petitioner was unjustly compelled to pay an enormous nazarana, amounting to five lakhs of Rupees, before his adoption was recognized by the Durbar. 2nd. That subsequently to the adoption of the petitioner, his mother was forcibly compelled by the Durbar to sign a bond for twenty lakhs of Rupees which were not due to the Durbar, and that on the strength of this false bond thus extracted from the petitioner's mother, six lakhs have actually been paid to the Durbar by the petitioner's firm. Srd. That the present Maharaja has appropriated, without payment, five magnificent sets of jewels which are the private property of the petitioner's, and which are valued at about 5 lakhs of Rupees.3 Ath. That the present Maharaja has also appropriated, without payment, a magnificent emerald necklace valued at upwards of five lakhs of Rupees, the private property of the petitioner. 5th. That the present Maharaja has forcibly compelled the petitioner to sign a deed of release for a sum of Rupees 75,000, which had been lent to the Maharaja before his accession by the petitioner's firm. bth. That the present Maharaja has resumed all the petitioner's villages and stopped his allowances without any cause whatever, although he, peti tioner, holds hereditary sanads for the villages and allowances in question, the genuineness of which has never been disputed. Htli. That during the minority of the petitioner, certain creatures of the Durbar have been placed in charge of the firm solely for the purpose of plundering it; and that loss to the extent of one lakh of Rupees has been caused by the depredations ofoneGirdhar Trikam so appointed by the Durbar. §th. That in order to procure the removal of the said Girdhar Trikam from his position as Manager, the petitioner was compelled by the Durbar to pay a sum of Rupees 75,000, though the estate was nominally under Durbar management and though Girdhar Trikam was the Durbar nominee. dth. That although Girdhar Trikam was removed by the Durbar on the payment of Rupees 75,000 by the petitioner, yet he was subsequently replaced in the same position by the Durbar, and continued to plunder the firm as before until finally removed a few months ago. With reference to the first complaint, the Durbar state that nazarana was levied in accordance with existing custom. The petitioner does not deny the existence of the custom, but contends that the amount levied was simply extortionate, and that the Durbar made use of'the exigency of the situation to exact an amount for which there is not only no precedent, but which in the case of trading firms is simply ruinous. The Resident respect fully submits that the petitioner's contention is just. He has reason to know that the case of the present petitioner is not an isolated case of extortion practised on a gigantic scale under colour of existing custom. The repre sentative of the late Gopalrao Myral has been similarly mulcted of the sum of ten lakhs or £100,000, although the right of adoption is a legal right,_ dependant not on the will of the Maharata, but on the recognized precepts of Hindu Law. With reference to the second complaint, the Durbar give no explanation whatever of the circumstances under which the bond for twenty lakhs was given by the petitioner's mother. This omission is significant. The petitioner's account is as follows : In the year Svt. 1920, the present Deputy Sir Subha named Narayenbhai Lallubhai (who left the British service under the Rewakanta Agency under suspicious circumstances, and who has figured conspicuously in many disgraceful trans actions) was sent by the Durbar to examine the accounts of the petitioner's firm. Narayenbhai in collusion with a certain discharged servant of Hari Bhagti's firm who had formerly acted as Munim, pretended to discover in the accounts of the firm a certain item of 15 lakhs which they alleged was due by the firm to the Durbar on account of certain transaction which occurred in Svt. 1854, or sixty-five years previously, ly guarantee of the British Government. The petitioner contends that this alleged debt of 15 lakhs is utterly false, and asserts that the claim was con cocted by his fraudulent ex-Munim together with Narayenbhai in order to give the Durbar a safe opportunity of plundering the firm. The claim thus concocted was immediately pressed by the Durbar, and the petitioner s mother was forcibly compelled to sign a bond for the whole amount of thealleged debt with interest, making up a total sum of twenty lakhs or £200,000 of English money. In order to secure her signature on this bond, the petitioner's mother was kept in confinement in her own house for one month, three other confidental clerks were imprisoned, and no one was allow ed to have access to her until she had complied with the Durbar s wishes and had signed the bond which was the signal for commencing the plunder. The lady was finally compelled to sign the bond on Kartag Sud 4th, Svt. 1920, and an aoreement was taken from her to pay the whole amount of 20 lakhs in instalments of three lakhs per annum. Two instalments were actually paid for the years Svt. 1920 and 1921, amounting to six lakhs. In the year Svt. 1922, for some reason or other which is not apparent, the payment of the instalments was discontinued. The bond however was not cancelled, and the amount of six lakhs which had been paid on the strength of this fraudulent bond^, been repaid to the firm. Vide detailed explanation Schedule II., Case 37. The Durbar's explanation of the petitioner's 3rd head of complaint is characteristic. It is asserted that the jewels appropriated by the present Maharaja were given by the petitioner as nazarana on the cancellation of the bond for the twenty lakhs above referred to; and it is represented that the cancellation of the bond was an act of grace on the part of Malharrao Gaekwai. Considering the fact that the bond had remained in abeyance since the yeai Svt. 1921 when the last instalment was paid, and considering the circumstances under which the bond had been originally extorted, the surrender of it by the present Gaekwar was a somewhat ambiguous act of grace. Khanderao Gaekwar first employed the bond to plunder Hari Bhagti's firm of six lakhs of Rupees, and Malharrao Gaekwar has employed the same bond to plunder the petitioner of jewels amounting to five lakhs of Rupees in value, under the shallow dis guise of performing an act of generosity. No explanation whatever has been given by the Durbar regarding the circumstances under which the Maharaja possess- * This necklace is a well- ed himself of the .petitioner's emerald necklace* known and celi-brateJ one for valued at upwards of five lakhs of Rupees, and the the costliness ot :ts lewels. . . , 4 ^ t . i i / v ir petitioner s being uncontradicted speaks for itself. The explanation of the Durbar regarding the petitioner's 5th head of complaint, viz., that the release for the Rupees 75,000 was given volun tarily, is under the circumstances simply incredible. To say nothing of the fact that the petitioner was a minor, and under the protection of the Durbar at the time, it is simply incredible that a business firm would have, without any reason whatever, waived their claim to three-quarters of a lakh. The petitioner moreover distinctly states that he was forcibly compelled to give a deed of release. The causes assigned by the Durbar for the resumption of the petitioner's villages and allowances are simply unintelligible. The petitioner is only one of numerous complainants who have been despoiled ina similar manner without any valid reason whatever except that the Durbar wished to possess them selves of property belonging to Baroda subjects in the easiest and most direct fashion. No explanation has been afforded regarding the petitioner's 7th head of complaint . The facts speak for themselves. Regarding the 8th and 9th subjects of complaint, the explanation of the Durbar can hardly be accepted. Girdhar Trikam was the individual ap pointed by the Durbar who had wrought such ruinous loss on the firm that the petitioner was readily induced to pay a nazarana for his removal; but considering that Girdhar Trikam was the Durbar's own nominee, the exaction of a nazarana for his removal was utterly preposterous. The statement that the petitioner subsequently applied for his services is, under the circum stances, simply incredible, besides being distinctly denied by the petitioner.The Resident having completed his review of the whole of this very dis- tn-aceful case, begs earnestly to invite to it the most careful attention of the Commission. The petitioner, it will be remembered, is the representative of a princely Banking firm intimately connected with the history of the Gaekwar, and well known throughout the whole of the Presidency. The facts of the case are substantiated by evidence of unimpeachable character, and no more glaring instance of spoliation on a gigantic scale has ever been made public. 11—37SCHEDULE 11. C ase N o. 39. Flogging Case. With reference to this case, the Sir Fouzdar Balvantrao Eshvant, one of the Durbar Agents now present, by whom the trial was held, hands in the proceedings in the case, which, he states, contain full particulars of the trial, and all information as to what took place at the trial which was held before him. He further states that the confessions were taken down in his presence and signed by the prisoners before him, in the course of the proceedings, and that these proceedings were completed, and the sentence of punishment pro nounced, before punishment was inflicted. His attention being drawn to the fact that certain of the depositions are unsigned by him, he states that it has so happened by oversight. A translation of the proceedings has been made by Eao Saheb Balkrishna, the Mamlatdar, attached as translator to the Commission, which will be found recorded in the file.

Out of these, accused Nos. 1 to 6 are charged with committing wilful murder, and Nos. 7 and 8 are charged with abetting the commission the said n—39 a2 offence, viz., that on the night of Sunday, Falgun Vadya 2nd, Svt. 1929, at Baroda, in the Government house, in Government sillekhana, Nos. 1 to 6 admi nistered arsenic to Jamdar Tatiaba Powar, by mixing in a dish called ' shri- khand' which was given him to eat at the time of his meals, whereby the said Tatiaba Powar died the next day, Falgun Vadya 3rd (Monday morning), and that Nos. 7 and 8 sold the arsenic to accused Nos. 1 and 2. This offence comes within the scope of the Foujdari decision No. 1. Accused Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 7 plead guilty, and Nos. 4, 5, 6, and 8 plead not guilty.

Statement of accused No. 7, Fatteh Ali Aminudin Borah. No. 9. Statement of accused No. 8, Eanchod Devji. No. 10. Report of medical men Narayenrao and Adarji, On a consideration of these papers recorded as Nos. 1 to 10, it appears that on a certain day the accused Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 thought of killing the Jamdar, Tatiaba Powar, by administering to him some poisonous substance. It was supposed by them that by so doing, the appointment held by the said Tatiaba would be conferred Jby Government on the accused No. 6, Raghu Sawat, and that he (Raghu) promising the other accused to provide them with situations on being so nominated in Tatiaba's place, instigated the accused No. 2 Daji bin Kari Powar, No. 3 Kamati Ganu bin Dhondi, and No. 4 Kamati Vithu bin Babaji Nikam, to proceed to the commission of this foul deed. An opportunity occurred on Falgun Vadya 2nd (Sunday morning) at about 8 o'clock, when the accused Nos. 2 and 3 went to the shop of Nurudin Borah, a supplier of medicinal drugs to Government, and managed to obtain from his Gumasta, the accused No. 8, Fatteh Ali, about a tola of arsenic under the pretext of its being needed for medicinal purposes. This poisonous substance was shown by them to accused No. 4, Kamati Vithu, and the matter formed the subject of conversation by the accused Nos, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 amongst themselves. After this, at about 3 o'clock p.m ., the accused No. 2, Daji bin Hari Powar, prepared the dish called ' shrikhand' and mixed in it the arsenic alluded to. The pot in which the ' shrikhand ' was put was closed up by tying a rumal (handkerchief) over its mouth. After this the deceased, Tatiaba Powar, together with the accused Nos. 2 to 7, proceeded to the parade ground, where the ceremony of sprinkling coloured powder in celebration of the Holi festival, took place. Thev all returned in the evening to the palace, when the deceased Tatiaba asked the accused No. 2, Dajiba Powar, to give him something to eat, as he felt hungry. The accused No. 2 told him that he had prepared the 'shri khand.' The accused Nos. 2,3 and 4 also prepared food as usual and called the deceased Tatiaba and others to eat. At the time of serving the meal, the deceased Tatiaba and accused No. 6 were given the dish ' shrikhand.' 'The deceased Tatiaba ate it with avidity, but theaccused No. 6 Raghu Sawat care- fully abstained, pretending that he could not eat owing to a pain in his stomach. After the lapse of some time, the poisonous drug contained in the ' shrikhand ' took effect, and Tatiaba at about 12 p.m . that night began to3 purge and vomit. After a while the deceased's sister, Lakshmibae, complain ant No. 1, came to the palace and asked him, while yet conscious, what was the matter with him. The deceased latiaba told her that the accused No. 2, Daji bin Hari Powar, had induced him to eat of the ' shrikhand, ' and had treacherously mixed with it some poisonous drug. Upon this information the medical men No. 10, Narayenrao Venayekrao and Adarjee Jamsedji, were sent for. They saw him and prescribed many remedies; but his case became hopeless, and he at last expired on Monday morning (Falgun Vadya 3rd). The accused No. 2, Daji bin Hari Powar, makes a confession to the above effect. In the same way the accused No. 3, Ganu bin Dhondi Devre, con fesses to having gone in company with the accused No. 2 and brought the arsenic alluded to from accused No. 8, and of its having been mixed with the 'shrikhand.' Similarly the accused No. 4, Vithoba bin Babaji Nikam, admits in his statement that the accused Nos. 2 and 3, after having brought the poison, informed him of the fact and showed it to him. He further states that the reason of administering poison to Tatiaba was that accused No. 5, Raghu, was to succeed him in his situation, and that Raghu had given him and the others assurance that they would all be provided with situations from Government. The accused No. 5, Raghu, denies this story But from the statements of accused Nos. 2, 3, and 4, as well as from the circum stance that he did not eat the 'shrikhand' which was served him by the accused No. 2, Daji, when he sat in company with the deceased Tatiaba to take his meal, pleading the false excuse that he was suffering from pain in his stomach, it appears clear that he was implicated in the perpetration of the foul deed. The accused No. 6, Narayen bin Shivba Vanjara, and No. 7, Lakshman bin Pandoba More, plead total ignorance of the above affair in their respective statements. They admit having accompained Tatiaba to the place where the ceremony of the sprinkling of coloured powder took place, but deny any knowledge of the poisoning. This latter statement is false, as the accused Nos. 2, or 3 and4 show that they were their accomplices. As all these persons used to live together, it shows that they (accused Nos. 6 and 7) were concerned in the perpetration of this murder. The accused No. 8, Fatteh Ali Aminudin, allows in his statement that when the accused Nos. 2 and 3 came to his shop and asked for arsenic, telling him that it was required for killing mice, he gave them that drug about a tola in weight, on the morning of Sunday, the 2nd of Falgun vadya. As regards the accused No. 9, Ghanchi Ranchod, the accused No. 2, Dajiba bin Hari Powar, has stated that he brought the arsenic from his (Ranchod's) shop, but the said Ranchod Devji denies this in his statement. On a search being made at his house, a quantity of arsenic was found in his shop. And Drs. Narayenrao and Adarji certify in their report that the deceased Tatiaba Powar's death was brought about by the effects of poison which had been swallowed by him. As it has been proved from this evidence, as also from the confessions of accused, that the Sarkari Jamdar Tatiaba Powar was deprived of his life by the abovementioned prisoners administering to him poison in the dish called ' shrikhand,' and the papers in this case having been explained to His Highness the Maharaja, the following sentence has been passed in accordance with his orders, viz., that the accused Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 shall, in consequence of their conviction of this offence, be whipped with twelve stripes each at each of the following stations, viz., the four gates, the mandvi, the house of the deceased Tatiaba, and near the Raopur platform, and that they shall each suffer rigorous imprisonment for life. It was further proclaimed throughout the city of Baroda that any one in future committing or being implicated in similar misdeeds, would be similarly punished. (Signed) BALVANTRAO ESHVANT.Endorsement to the effect that the above punishment of whipping has been inflicted and that the prisoners have been forwarded to the jail with a yadee No. 11C5, to the address of the jail officer.

Dated Kartick Vadya 1st, Svt. 1930, 5th November 1873. (Signed) BALVANTRAO ESHVANT. Precis of the Vernacular (Marathi and Guzerathi) papers of evidence, recorded in criminal case No. 102 of 1873. 1. Complaint on solemn affirmation submitted before Balvantrao Eshvant by one Lakshmi, widow of Jotiba Katkar, dated Falgun vad 4th, Svt. 1929, representing that her brother Tatiaba Powar was murdered by Daji Kamati, who administered to him poison in a dish called 'shrikhand,' and that in support of this charge there were three witnesses, Eshvantabin Bapuji, Raghu bin Bajirao, and Vithu bin Babaji. She begs that enquiries may be instituted in the matter and the offender brought to punishment. 2. Statement of the accused No. 1, Dajiba bin Hari Powar (taken before Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear that officer's signature), is dated Falgun vad 4th, Monday Svt. 1929, in which he deposes that the deceased Tatiaba Powar had directed him yesterday to prepare 'shrikhand' for him, which he prepared that day about 3 p.m . and putin a vessel the mouth of which was closed by him, the room in which it was kept being locked. When he returned that evening to the palace, Tatiaba informed him that he was hungry, and that he therefore placed the ' shrikhand' before him, meanwhile his food was brought in a plate by one Eshvantrao Kamati, and Tatiaba sat down to ws eat. That he placed before him the 'shrikhand' about three-quarters of a seer in weight, the whole of which was eaten by him. At about midnight Tatiaba began to purge and vomit, and about 5 next morning he was taken to l)is house by his sister Lakshmibae. Meantime news was received that Ta tiaba had died. He is ignorant of the cause of his death. He did not put any poison in the 'shrikhand,' nor was he instigated by others to do so. He saw JTatiaba some time after his meal, and he was purging and vomiting. He complained of a burning sensation in his body. The ' shrikhand' was prepared by him alone and nobody was present at the time. Tatiaba was all right before he took his meal. Further statement of the accused No. 1, Dajiba, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant (but does not bear that officer's signature), has the same date, but instead of Monday, Tuesday is written there. The accused states as fol lows :—On the night of Sunday last, the ' shrikhand'' which he had given Tatiaba to eat was mixed by him with white powder of arsenic. This arsenic was brought to him by the accused Lakshman More and Ghanu Devre from the shop of accused Fatteh Ali, and was about half a tola in weight. Accused Vithu Kamati and Narayen Vanjara are also accomplices in this act. The reason of Tatiaba's being poisoned was that accused Raghu Sawat some 4 days back said that if Tatiaba were poisoned and died he would get his place and thereby be able to provide all with employment under Government. Being thus instigated, he together with others did this act. The accused Raghu Sawat was served with the ' shrikhand,' but he did not eat it, as he knew it had poison in it. The arsenic was not brought from a Bania's shop. 3. Statement of the accused No. 2, Ghanu bin Dhondiba More, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant (but does not bear that officer's signature), is dated Falgun vad. 4th, Tuesday, ^||. The accused Ghanu denies having any knowledge of the cause of the death of Tati-aba Powar, but he simply beard, as he lives near him, that he died on Monday last. As his (accused Ghanu's) mother died at that time, he was embarrassed in his affairs, and therefore he knew nothing of that matter. He does not know who prepared the ' shrik hand,' and whether any poisonous substance was putin it. He knows nothing about that affair. Further statement of the same accused taken the same day, but does not bear the signature of Balvantrao Eshvant. The accused states:—The above statement is not true, but what he states now is true. He did not bring the arsenic himself, but it was given him by accused Dajiba Kamati to be kept with him and given him back when required. He gave it back to him at about 9 o'clock when he (Dajiba) returned from his house. He was aware of the evil intention of the accused Raghu Sawat, Dajiba and Vithu to make Tatiaba swallow the poison in curds, and thereby to kill him. On Sunday following the accused Dajiba mixed the powder of arsenic in the ' shrikhand ' prepared by him and it was eaten by Tatiaba. The reason of doing this was that the accused Raghu Sawat wished to deprive Tatiaba of his place. All this intrigue he was aware of. Further statement of the same accused, taken the same day, but does not bear the signature of Balvantrao Eshvant. The accused states: — It was he and accused Daji who brought the powder of arsenic from the accused l^atteh Ali, gumasta of Nurudin Borah, under the pretext that it was required for medicinal purposes. n—39 b6 4. Statement of accused No. 3 Vithoba bin Babaji Nikam, taken before Balvantrao Bshvant, but does not bear his signature. It is dated Falgun vad 4 th Tuesday, Svt, 1929. The accused stales:—He is not awate of the cause of Tatiaba's' death. He only knew yesterday (Monday) that Tatiaba had died. He knows nothing about the preparation of the ' shrikhand,' or whe ther any poison was administered to Tatiaba. Further statement of the same accused, taken before the same officer, the same day, but does not bear his signature. The above statement is not true, but what he now states is true. Some 4 or 5 days ago, the accused Dajiba Kamati, Gham; Sawat, and Lakshman were sitting on a terrace and thought of poisoning Tatiaba. Accordingly on Sunday last, accused Dajiba prepared the 'shrikhand,' and mixed with it powder of arsenic. Dajiba gave this to Tatiaba to eat, and the latter ate it. He is not aware from what place Dajiba brought the arsenic. The reason of doing all this was that Dajiba expected to get Tatiaba's place, and Daji also mentioned that even if the accused Raghu got Tatiaba's place, he (accused Vithu) would be provided with a situation. Further statement of the same accused, taken the same day, but does not bear the signature of Balvantrao Eshvant. The accused says :—He did not go with accused Daji to bring arsenic. Accused Daji and Ghanu are the persons who brought it from the Government Borah's shop. This fact having been told him by them, he replied that they had done right. He did not say this before, because he was told by accused Raghu and Ghanu not to divulge the secret even if he were beaten. 5. Statement of the accused No. 4, Raghu bin Baji Sawat, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear his signature. It is dated Falgun vad 4th, Tuesday, Svt. 1929. The accused says :—On the night of Falgun vad 2nd, Sunday, f-nri® , Tatiaba Powar was all right. At about 8 p.m ., Tatiaba and himself sat down to eat. Both were served with ' shrikhands,' Tatiaba ate it, but he, Raghu, could not eat it as he had a pain in his stomach. It is a fact that after some time, about 12 o'clock midnight, Tatiaba began purging and vomiting, and that he died on the morning of Monday following. He did not tell Lakshman More and Ghanu Devre to bring arsenic, nor does he know whether or not accused Dajiba had put any poison in the ' shrikhand.' He and Dajiba Kamati are at variance with each other. He did not see the accused Dajiba preparing the ' shrikhand,' and does not know when it was prepared by him. 6. Statement of the accused No. 5, Narayen bin Shivba Vanjara, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear that officer's signature. It is dated Falgun va-d 4th, Tuesday, Svt. 1929. The accused pleads ignorance of the cause of the death of Tatiaba, and denies everything as regards the above- related affair. 7. Statement of accused No. 6 Lakshman bin Pandoba More, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear that officer's signature. It is dated Falgun vad 4th, Tuesday, Svt. 1929. The accused states :—He does not know of the sickness and cause of Tatiaba's death, but was simply informed on arrival at the palace that Tatiaba had expired. He is not aware whether or not Tatiaba ate ' shrikhand,' and does not know by whom it was prepared. There was no consultation between accused Raghu and himself about any affair, and he was not concerned in bringing any arsenic. He does not know anything about it. He has no enmity against the accused Daji.Substance. Guzerati Depositions. Accused No. 7, Fatteh All Aminudin, states:—I am a Gumasta (servant) of the Government Borah Nurudin Miakhan. The day before yesterday, Falgun vad 2nd, Sunday, Government Kamati Ghanu and Daji who are now present, came early in the morning to my shop and asked for arsenic for the purpose of killing rats. Consequently I brought and gave, without weighing, about ^ tola of the poison, which was in a tin-box in my master's house. No record was kept, and no price was taken, but it was given without payment. The tin-box which contains the arsenic in my master's house is produced by me. Falgun vad 4th, Tuesday, Samvat 1929. Before me. (no signature.) Accused No. 8, Ranchhod Devji, states :—I have never sold arsenic to Daji bin Hari, a Kamati, who is now present. My master Naraj^en Dwarka- das sells arsenic at his shop, but he does not sell it to anybody without a permit from the Government. Question.—Daji Kamati says that you have given him the arsenic. How do you explain this ? Answer.— I have sold no arsenic. Falgun vad 4th, Samvat i929. Before me, (no signature.) 8. Report of the Medical men named Narayenrao Venayek and Adarji Jamsedji, dated Falgun vad 3rd, Svt. 1929. It bears the endorsement of its having been recorded in the case, but there is no signature of Balvantrao Eshvant below it. They state—Yesternight at about 12 o'clock they were sent for by the Durbar, and on arrival were ordered to examine Tatiaba as he was very ill. Tatiaba was purging and vomiting for a long time and was suffering much from a burning sensation in his stomach and all over his body. Looking to the state of his sufferings they recognized signs of Tatiaba having swallowed some poisonous substance. Several medicines were given to lessen the effects of the poison, but they were of no avail. He at last died in the morning and his nails turned black. Judging from the symptoms andappear- ances they cannot arrive at any other conclusion than this, that his (latiaba's) death was the result of his having partaken of some poison.

(Signed) B11U J AX G11 AO MORESHVAR, NISBAT BALVANTRAO ESHVANT. Final Statement by the Resident. 1874. An outline of the main points in this case has been given in Schedule No. 11., and in continuation thereof, the Resident now begs to submit the accompanying detailed comment on the Judicial proceedings of the Durbar, produced in Court on the 17th December last. •2. The Resident would observe that he had no opportunity of inspect ing the original proceedings, until they were laid before the Commission by the Sir Foujdar Balvantrao Eshvant, the officer who holds them ; nor has he been furnished with copies of them. There is. however, it is submitted, sufficient evidence on the face of them to show, that they are utterly untrust worthy, and the Resident has no hesitation in reiterating the opinion which he has before expressed, as to the real character of this very serious case; especially serious he would submit, in consequence of the contemptuous con duct of the Durbar in connection with it from the very first. 3. On the 17th December, the Resident offered to produce the wives of the 2 prisoners still in jail, to show that severe flogging preceotea? the alleged confessions ; it was decided, however, by the Commission not to go into the details of the case, but to obtain a general statement of the facts from the Durbar Agent Balvantrao Eshvant, who had conducted it. Under these circumstances, the case still remained open for inquiry. 4. This official, however, in answer to the very reasonable request of the President of the Commission, that he would favour them with a brief explanatory account of the circumstances as they occurred from the beginning, declined to do so, under the pretence that as a member of the Durbar he could not allow himself to be examined by the Commission without the orders of the Maharaja, or words to that effect. He eventually consented to put in certain proceedings, and to verify them in the manner recorded by the Commission. 5. The Resident regrets to be obliged to record, in the interests of justice, that the manner and bearing of the Sir Foujdar Balvantrao Eshvant on this as well as other occasions, before the Commission, was not such as to convey a sense of his credibility as a Durbar Agent, and it will be seen from a perusal of the alleged confessions which he then put in, are attested by his signature, that without the explanatory statement which the Commission asked for, and the Sir Foujdar declined to make, no light whatever is thrown upon the current of events as they took place in this case between about 9 p.m . on Sunday the 16th of March last, and 10 or 11 o'clock p.m . of Tuesday the 18th idem. 6. That omission, however, the Resident is now in a position to supply in somewhat fuller detail than has already been given in the petition of Borah Hasanbhai which accompanied his letter to Government, No. dated 27th October last.7. It appears that on Sunday the 16th of March, the deceased Tatia Powar took part in the general Holi ceremonies, during which he was exposed in the sun in wet clothes for several hours. In the evening he returned home, washed with cold water and limejuice in order to remove the stains of the red powder that had been thrown over him, and partook freelj of liquor with his dinner. Later again in the evening, viz., between 8 and 9, he appears to have eaten a large quantity of an indigestible dish called &lt;&lt; sljrikhand, 3 ' and to have drunk more spirits, not long after which he seems to have been seized with Asiatic cholera, the natural consequence of the exposure, &amp;c., that he had undergone throughout the day; and m corroboration of this view of the case, the following evidence is forth coming. Borah Nurudin Miakhan, medicine seller to the Baroda Government, states on solemn affirmation before the Resident on 5th January 1874, that he was summoned to the Palace at 10 p.m . on 16th of March last when Tatia Powar was taken ill. Maharaja's chief Hakim was present at that time, he questioned Tatia regarding his illness which he did not attribute to poison. Witness believed that Tatia was suffering from Asiatic cholera. John Doc tor, Aderji Doctor, and Narayenrao Doctor came, and all of them expressed the opinion that the patient was suffering from cholera. Poison was not spoken of by any of them. Had such suspicion existed, antidotes would have been used. On the 2nd day after Tatia's death, witness was summoned to the Foujdari, together with his ,two Gumastas. He there saw three of the accused persons lying in an almost insensible state from beating, bodies lacerated and tied with ropes; did not see the flogging, but he was informed that they were flogged in front of the Foujdari. One of these accused named Ghanu pointed to his gumasta Fateh Ali as the person by whom poison was sold. Fateh Ali denied having sold any poison. The Foujdar thereupon called the witness downstairs and appealed to him. He stated that he kept all poisons in his own charge, and that Fateh Ali could not possibly have sold any poison, as alleged. Notwithstanding this explanation Fateh Ali was flogged'at the Foujdari till he confessed to having sold the poison. Witness repeated that the confession was false, because he kept the poisons himself, and he asked that Government sepoys might be sent with him to his house, when he would satisfy them on this point. He did so, but nevertheless he was fined 5,000 Rupees. After this Fateh Ali and others were publicly flogged through the city. Witness II., Borah Fath Ali states, on solemn affirmation—That noon on Tuesday the 18th of March, he went to the Foujdari on hearing that some Government men were being beaten; he saw one man flogged until he confessed; in order to increase the pain, a decoction of salt and chillies was used. About 1 p.m. the Maharaja c wiid day drive, and the Foujdar conversed with him. ^ The man who was being flogged at last confessed that he had bought poison from a Ghanchi boy. Witness after this returned home. At about 4 p.m . the same day his master, himself, and another Gumasta were called to the I oujdari. Theie was a large concourse of people there. A man who had just been flogged pointed at witness, and said that he had bought poison from him. Witness was told by Balvantrao Eshvant to confess, or that he would be treated in the same way that the others had been. Witness declined to confess, not having sold any poison. His master was then told to induce him to confess, and he desired him to tell the truth. Witness again denied having sold any poison. The Foujdar Balvantrao then had his clothes taken off, and he was bound to a post and severely flogged. At intervals he was desired to confess, and on his refusal, the beating was renewed. At last he falsely confessed that he had sold the poison. Witness's master was then called, and he stated it to be im possible that witness could have sold the poison, because he kept it himself. ii—39 c10 He was made to produce the poison from his house. A statement was then taken down, and witness was told to sign it. He declined, and was at that time taken from him ; but he was taken with 7 others round the city and flogged in certain streets. During this the accused Ghanu died. * Witness and others received in all upwards of 100 lashes. All were then taken to Jail; late at night a Karkun came, and forced him was taken at the Foujdari. He was heavily ironed on legs, hands, and throat,* . , and was released on the occasion of the lunar eclipse ^eiy unusua in November last. After being flogged at the Fouj dari before confession, witness and others were flogged near the Palace in the presence of the Maharaja; they were then flogged at the Pani Darvaja and 8 other places. This flogging lasted from 5 p.m . till 10 p.m ., when witness was released ; he was very sick. His father told him that he had received warning that he was not to make any complaint to the Resident. His father unfortunately died about a month ago. 8. The above facts are generally corroborated by 3 other witnesses, and from the publicity of the proceedings at the Foujdari and elsewhere, many others could no doubt be obtained to give evidence. 9. In addition to the above evidence, there is that of Gujabae, sister of the accused Ghanu who was flogged to death. She presented her petition to the Commission on the 22nd of December, two days before their departure, and it was handed over by them to the Resident. Her statement is as follows: — That her brother Ghanu was arrested on Tuesday the 18th of March about mid-day on suspicion of having been concerned in poisoning one Tatia Powar. She followed Ghanu to the Foujdari in a wooden frame and severely flogged. A decoction of salt and chillies was applied to the wounds. She was not allowed to go near her brother, so did not hear what was said to him or what he replied. Two or three hours sub sequently some Borahs came, and one of them was flogged. In the evening T . ^ . her brother was taken with others through the city Inhuman treatment or the ii-in t • .i*. . , i . i deceased person. anc * publicly flogged ; owing to his treatment at the Foujdari, he could not walk, supported by hamhoo sticks. After he had been flogged at three or four places, he died in Bajivada. The body was carried to the Jail, and was given to the relatives about 10 p.m . The body was dreadfully lacerated, and the private parts were seriously injured. Ghanu's two houses and to witness were contiguous. Next day all the 3 houses and all property therein were attached and everybody turned out of General confiscation of both them, and they were made over to Lakshmi, Tatia's deceaseds and witness s pro- • , /-.i , ~ ^ - , ' p er ty. sister. Ghanu s 2 sons, aged 8 and 4 years, are alive, and are utterly destitute. Ghanu's wife is dead. Witness cannot state the value of his property ; her own was worth 1,200 Rupees. Witness represents that she has committed no crime to deserve the forfeiture, and that she has also lost a pension of 7 Rupees a month, which she used to receive from the Durbar. The deceased Tatia lived in her neighbourhood, and none of the neigh bours suspected that he had died from the effects of poison. 10. It is submitted that these statements supply the information which was required to throw light on the Foujdar's proceedings, viz., that interval between the denial of the crime and confession of it by the accused persons Daji, Ghanu, and Vithoba, they were flogged in order to make themII confess that they were concerned in the alleged crime of poisoning Tatia Powar, whereas there is reason to believe that no crime was committed, Tatia Powar having died from the effects of his own intemperance. 11. Upon this point, in paras. 9 and 10 of the original report which the Resident made to Government, No. I, dated 25th March 1873, the Maharaja is stated to have said as follows :— 'That a few days ago a confidential body-servant of his own, whose par- ticular occupation it was to prepare his food, and provide him with drinking water, &amp;c., had died suddenly after an hour or two's illness. That he felt very much startled and shocked at this, in consequence of the man's relation to himself as a confidential servant, and he even began to doubt whether it was not the commencement of some ' fitur fusad ' (these were the words used) against himself, and consequently that he set his best men to make enquiries, sifting the matter generally, and ascertaining the cause of death, which if caused by poison was to lead to the most strenuous efforts being put forth to discover the murderers. The result of his enquiry was that 8 men, some of whom belonged to his own household, were apprehended, and shortly after confessed their crime in having mixed arsenic with the food of the deceased.' &lt;c 10. His Highness was at first advised to hang them all, but this he said he declined to do, as he wished to see what information could be obtained from them in regard to their object, &amp;c, &amp;c.' 12. It will be noticed as a most material circumstance that neither did the Maharaja in his original account to the Resident, nor did the complainant Lakshmi in her deposition before the Sir Foujdar, make any allusion what ever to the fact that the deceased Tatia was said to have made to his sister a dying declaration to the effect that he had been poisoned by Daji Kamati. 13. These circumstances go to confirm the evidence of the Borah Nuru- din, and of the accused Ghanu's sister, to the effect that at first no suspicion was entertained that Tatia Powar had been poisoned. It will be also remem bered that the chief accused, Daji Kamati, at his first examination on Mon day, March 17th, denied all knowledge of the alleged crime, and gave what appears to be a very probable explanation of the cause of the deceased's death, and it is only in his second statement after the flogging scenes in front of the Foujdari of which we have recorded evidence, that Uajiwas induced to crimi nate himself and several others ; and it is upon such evidence and such alone that the whole case rests as submitted by the Durbar. 14. In conclusion, the Resident would submit that, following so closely as this case did upon the suspicious deaths in prison of Raoji Master, Ghanu M'agh, Malharba Shelki, Govindji Naik, and Bhao Sindia, the orders of Go vernment conveyed in their letter. No. 1-T, dated April 23rd, 1873, were, under the circumstances, not only natural, but absolutely necessary in the interests of humanity and justice. 15. These orders were duly communicated to the Durbar, and informa tion was called for on certain points named by Government. Six months elapsed before any reply was received, and then only after a reminder. That reply not being considered satisfactory by Government, the Resident received orders to bring the case before the Commission, in pursuance of which instructions he applied to the Durbar for the proceedings in the case. 16. These though repeatedly asked for were not given until the case was actually called on before the Commission, and then the Resident had neither time nor opportunity to examine them, and they were returned to the Durbar after the Commission had done with them. 17. It is, however, important to note that the Sir Foujdar, consistently with the actions maintained by the Durbar throughout the whole case since12 last April, refused, when called upon by the Commission, to give any ex planation regarding them beyond the curt one recorded. 18. Thus from first to last the reasonable requests of the Bombay Govern ment, the Resident, and the Commission have been systematically resisted by the Durbar in this case. Evidence in the Flogging Case produced by the Sir Foujdar before the Commission on the 17th and 18th December 1878 :— Durbar''s S precis of the Vernacular (Marathi and Guzerathi) papers of evidence recorded in Criminal Case No. 102 of 1873. 1. Complaint on solemn affirma tion submitted before Balvantrao Eshvant by one Lakshmi, widow of Jotiba Katkar, dated Falgun vad 4th, Samvat 1929, representing that her brother Tatiaba Powar was murdered by Daji Kamati, who administered to him poison in a diet called ' shri- khand, ' and that in support of this charge there were 3 witnesses, Esh- vanta bin Bapuji, Raghu bin Bajirao, and Vithu bin Babaji. She begs that enquiries may be instituted into the matter, and the offender brought to punishment. Remarks hy It will be observed that one Laksh mi, sister of the deceased, is said to have complained on Tuesday the Ibth March last that one Daji Ka- mati had poisoned her brother Tatia. In support of her statement, she is stated to have called the 3 witnesses named. It will be observed that the witness first-named, Eshvanta bin Bapuji, has never all, and that the two other persons who are alleged to have been named as witnesses were examined not as witnesses but as accused persons. In support therefore of the complain ant's alleged statement, there does not appear to have been any evi dence recorded whatever, except the alleged statements of accused per sons. The Resident has never been furnished with a copy of the original complaint, and from the statements of the two persons named by her, he utterly disbelieves the truth of the original complaint, because what is here stated materially conflicts with the Durbar's explanation given in their yad No. 2,145 of October 9th, 1873, in which the deceased himself is said to have told his sister Lakshmi that Daji had poisoned him ; and had thus himself initiated the en quiry. In the present proceedings these very important allegations no where appear in evidence, though they are actually used as established facts by the Sir Foujdar in his find ing as one of the grounds for his judgment. This fact of itself, inde pendently of certain other false state ments made by this official, prove, it is submitted, how utterly unreliable the whole of the Sir Foujdar's pro ceedings are./i/'j-f Durbar St 2. Statement of accused No. 1, Dajiba bin Had Powar, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear that officer's signature, is dated Falgun vud 4th, Monday, Samvat 1929, in which he deposes that the deceased Tatiaba Powar had direct- ed him yesterday to prepare ' shrik- hand ' for him, which he prepared that day at about '3 p.m . and put it in a vessel, the mouth of which was closed by him, the room in which it was kept being closed. When he returned that evening to the place, Tatiaba informed him that he was hungry, and that he therefore placed the ' shrikhand ' before him, mean while his food was brought in a plate by one Eshvantrao Kamati, and Ta tiaba sat down to eat. That he placed before him the ' shrikhand' about three-quarters of a seer in weight, the whole of which was eaten byhim. At about midnight, Tatia ba began to purge and vomit, and about 5 next morning he was taken to his house by his sister Lakshmibai. Meantime news were received that Tatiaba had died. He is ignorant of the cause of his death. He did not put any poison in the 'shrikhand,' nor was he instigated by others to do so. He saw Tatiaba sometime after his meal, and he was purging and vomiting. He com plained of a burning sensation in his body. The ' shrikhand' was pre pared by him alone and nobody was present at the time. Tatiaba was all right before he took his meal. Further statement of the accused No. 1, Dajiba, taken before Balvant rao Eshvant, but does not bear that officer's signature. It bears the same date, but instead of Monday, Tuesday is written there. The accused states as follows: — On the night of Sunday last, the ' shrik hand' which he had given Tatiaba to eat was mixed by him with white powder of arsenic. This arse- ni c was brought to him by the accused Lakshman More and Ganu Devre from the shop of accused atteh Ali, and was about half a n—39 d Remarks by It will be observed that this depo sition purports to have been taken on Falgun vad 4th M and that the deponent speaks of having pre pared the poisoned the day previously, Sunday. Whea~is stated that Falgun vad 4th, Tuesday, and not Monday, the in correct statement regarding the day on which the poisoned food was pre pared becomes very material. It is inconceivable that so important a discrepancy could possibly have oc curred by accident. It will be noticed that this accused appears to have made two statements bearing the same date, but the day of the week being differently given. In the first statement made by the accused person, he denies all know ledge of the alleged crime. In the further statement,/or is apparent on the ceedings, he gives what purports to be a detailed confession of the alleged crime. It is respectfully submitted that it is a point of extreme import ance to ascertain what actually occurredm the interval between these two examinations, because it is con trary to reason to suppose that with out some cause or other, which does not appear on the face of the pro ceedings, any accused person will suddenly repudiate his previous denial and voluntarily criminate him self in a matter of life and death, and it was to supply information on such points as this that a statement of the Sir Foujdar was absolutely necessary. The Commission were ' indeed assured in general terms that ' these proceedings contain full par- ' ticulars of the trial, and ' matron as to what took place at the ' trial which was held before him,' (the Sir Foujdar), yet it will be seen that in this and every other instance quoted below, in which alleged con fession is made, the proceedings fail to explain the sudden transition from positive denial of all knowledge of the crime to the most complete cri mination of themselves, and of all whom the Durbar thought fit to arraign in connection with the case.14 Durbar State tola in weight. Accused Vithu Kamati and Narayen Wanjara are also accomplices in this act. The reason of Tatiaba's being poisoned was that accused Raghu Sayat, some four days back, said, if Tatiaba were poisoned to death, he would get his place, and thereby be able to provide all with employment in Government. Being thus instigated, he, together with others, did this act. The accus ed Raghu Savat was served with the ' shrikand,' but he did not eat it, as he knew it had poison in it. The arsenic was not brought from a Bania's shop. 3. Statement of accused No. 2, Ganu bin Dhondiba More, taken be fore Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear that officer's signature. It is dated Falgun vad 4th, Tuesday, Sumvat 1929. The accused Ganu denies having any knowledge of the cause of the death of latiaba Powar, but he simply heard, as he lives near him, that he died on Monday last. As his (accused Ganu's) mother died at that time, he was embarrassed in her affairs, and therefore he knew nothing of that matter. He does not know who prepared the 'shrikand: and whether any poisonous substance was put in it. He knows nothing about that affair. Further statement of the same accused taken the same day, but does not bear the signature of Bal- vantrao Eshvant. The accused states:—* The above true, hut what he He did not bring the arsenic himself, but it was given him by accused Dajiba Kamati to be kept with him and given him back when required. He gave it back to him at about 9 o'clock, when he (Dajiba) returned from his house. He was aware of the evil intention of the accused Raghu Savat, Dajiba, and Vithu to make Tatia swallow the poison in curds, and thereby to kill him. On Sunday following, the accused Daji ba mixed the powder of arsenic in the 'shrikhand' prepared by him. Remarks hy It will be seen that in the alleged confession of this accused person, the names of his alleged accomplices are for the first time introduced ; no information whatever having been previously submitted regarding them. No suspicion regarding any of these persons has even been mentioned in Lakshmi's complaint, which accused Dajiba only. This is the man who was flogged to death. The only information against him already recorded in the Foujdar's proceedings is the alleged confession of the accused Daji. It will be observed that Ganu first denied all knowledge of the alleged crime, and afterwards, as Daji had done, gave what purports to be detailed confession of the said crime. It is also significant that this accused was recalled twice on the day when his examination was taken, and that on each occasion he is induced to give the names of fresh accomplices. His alleged confession, moreover, though purporting fact as were stated by accused Daji, does not tally with Daji's statement. Daji states that the arsenic was brought to him by Ganu ; Ganu states that Daji himself gave him the arsenic. * Nearly every man uses this language after his first statement. No explanation it was pur chased.15 Durbar Statem and it was eaten by Tatiaba. The reason of doing this was that the accused Raghu Savat wished to de prive Tatiaba of his place. All this intrigue he was aware of. Further statement of the same ac cused taken the same day, but does not bear the signature of Balvantrao Eshvant. The accused states :—It was he and accused Daji who brought the powder of arsenic from the accused Fatteh Ali, Gumasta of Nurudin Borah, under the pretext that it was required for medicinal purposes. 4. Statement of accused No. 3 Vithuba bin Babaji Nikam, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear his signature. It is dated Falgun vad 4th Tuesday, Samvat 1929. The accused states:—He is not aware of the cause of Tatiaba's death. He only knew yesterday, (Monday), that Tatiaba had died. He knows nothing about the pre paration of the shrikand, or whether any poison was administered to Tatiaba. Further statement of the same accused, taken before the same of ficer, the same day, but does not bear his signature. The above state ment is not true, but what he now states is true. Some four or five days ago the accused Dajiba Kamati, Ganu Savat, and Lakshman were sitting on a terrace and of poisoning Tatiaba. Accordingly on Sunday last accused Dajiba prepared the ' shrikhand,' and mixed with it powder of arsenic. Dajiba gave this to Tatiaba to eat, and the latter ate it. He is not aware from what place Dajiba brought the arsenic. The reason of doing all this was that Dajiba expected to get Tatiaba's place, and Daji also mentioned that even if the accused Raghu got Tatiaba's place, he (accused Vitho- ba) would be provided with a situa tion. Further statement of the same ac cused taken the same day, but does not bear the signature of Balvantrao Remarks hy As in the previous cases, the accused person after giving a com plete denial of the alleged crime appear suddenly, for no assignable reason, to have'made a detailed con fession. It will be observed that this accused person had been called by the complainant Lakshmi as a witness, but was never examined as' such; he appears, however, to have been arrested on the statement of Daji, and after first denying all knowledge of the crime, after two separate intervals (during which something must have happened which the Sir Foujdar ought to have explained), he was induced to cri minate not only himself, but also the other accused persons except the Ghanchi boy No. 8.16 Durbar Sta Eshvant. The accused says he did not go with accused Daji to bring arsenic. Accused Daji and Ganu are the persons who brought it from the Government Borah's shop. This fact was told him by them, he replied that they had done right. He did not tell all this before, because he was told by accused, Raghu and Ganu, not to divulge the secret even if he were beaten. 5. Statement of the accused No. 4 Raghu bin Baji Savat, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear his signature. It is dated Fal- gun vad 4th, Tuesday, Svt. 1929. The accused says; —On the night of the Falgun vad 2nd, Sunday, Svt. 1929, Tatiaba Powar was all right. At about 8 p.m ., Tatia and himself sat down to eat. Both were served with ' shrikhand.' Tatiaba ate it, but he, Raghu, could not eat it, as he had a pain in his stomach. It is a fact that after some time, about 12 o'clock p.m., Tatiaba began purging and vomit ing, and that he died on the morn ing of Monday following. He did not tell Lakshman More and Ganu Devre to bring arsenic, nor does he know whether or not accused Dajiba had put any poison in the ' shri khand.' He and Dajiba Kamati are at variance with each other. He did not see the accused Dajiba pre paring the ' shrikhand,' and does not know when it was prepared by him. 6. Statement of accused No, 5, Narayen bin Shivba Wanjara, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear that officer's signature. It is dated Falgun vad 4th, Tuesday, Samvat 1929. The accused pleads ignorance of the cause of the death of Tatiaba, and denies everything as regards the above related affair. Remarks bg This person was calledby complain ant Lakshmi as a witness, but he was never examined as such ; he appears, however, to have been arrested on the information of Daji and to have been placed on his trial. It appears from the statements of Daji, Ganu, and Vithoba, that Raghu principal who instigated the com mission of the alleged crime, in order to obtain the deceased's place. The accused himself denies all know ledge of the crime, and there is no evidence whatever against him, except what purports to be the con fessions of the three accused persons before-mentioned. The only evidence against this accused is the statement of Daji, who merely cites him as an accomplice, without showing in what way, or for what reasons, &amp;c. In the Sir Foujdar's finding it is stated that evidence against this ac cused was given by accused Ganu and Vithoba (exhibits Nos. 3 and 4). This statement is The more this case is looked into, the more abundantly will it appear why the Sir Foujdar declined to enter into detailed explanation before the Com- mission.17 Durbar St 7. Statement of Lakshman bin Pandoba, accused No. 6, taken before Balvantrao Eshvant, but does not bear that officer's signature. It is dated Falgun vad 4th, Tuesday, Sam vat 1929. The accused states :— He does not know of the sickness and cause of Tatiaba's death, but was simply informed, on arrival at the palace, that Tatiaba had expired. He is not aware whether or not Tatiaba ate 'shrikhand,' and does not know by whom it was prepared. There was no consultation between accused Raghu and himself about any affair, and he was not concerned in bring ing any arsenic. He does not know anything about it. He has no enmity against the accused Daji. 8. Statement ofFatteh Ali Amin- udin, accused No. 7. I am a gumasta (servant) of the Government Borah, Nurudin Mia- khan. The day before yesterday, Falgun vad 2nd, Sunday, Govern ment Kamati Daji and Ganu, who are now present, came early in the morning to my shop and asked for arsenic for the purpose of kill ing rats; consequently, I brought and gave, without weighing, half a tola of the poison, which was in a tin box in my master's house. No record was kept, and no price was taken, but it was given without pay ment. The tin box which contains the arsenic in my master's house is produced by me, Falgun vad 4th, Tuesday, Samvat 1929. Before me, (no signature.) Remarks hy Denies all knowledge whatever of the transaction, and there is nothing against him except Daji's statement that lie brought the poison from the Borah's shop to him. The statement however is flatly contradicted by the Borah boy Fatteh Ali. In the Sir Foujdar's finding, evi dence is said to have been given against this accused by Ganu. This statement is false ; yet the man was unmercifully flogged at 7 different places with 12 stripes, and condemn ed with the rest to imprisonment for life. This accused person is said to have acknowledged that on Sunday, the 2nd of last, Daji and Ganu came to his shop and asked for arsenic for killing rats, which he brought from his master's /house and gave to them. This alleged admission of the boy has been made use of by the Sir Foujdar in his find ing as amounting to a plea of guilty to the charge of abetting wilful murder. Even if the boy gave the arsenic, as alleged, for killing rats, it does not prove that he was in any way implicated in the alleged crime of poisoning, of which no one has even accused him except the Fouj dar. His sentence therefore of an unmerciful flogging through the city and imprisonment for life, appears, on the Durbar's own showing, to be utterly unjustifiable. Morever, ac- cordingto Section 45 of the Criminal Code of the Gaekwar's State, any person selling arsenic without the permission of Government, shall, on conviction, be liable to imprisonment up to 3 months, or to a fine of Rs. 20, or both ; whereas not only has this boy been punished as above describ ed, but his master also. Nurudin Miakhan was fined Rupees 5,000 by the Maharaja, for the supposed crime of leaving his arsenic, so as tobeac- cessible to his gumasta. n—3918 Durbar S Statement of the Ghanchi boy Ranchod Devji, accused No. 8. I have never sold arsenic to Daji bin Hari, a Kamati, who is now pre sent. My master, Narayen Dwark- das, sells arsenic at his shop, but he does not sell it to anybody without a permit from the Government. Question.—'Dajx Kamati says that you have given him the arsenic. How do you explain this ? Answer. —I have sold no arsenic. Falgun vad 4th, Samvat 1929. Before me, (no signature.) Remarks hy This boy's uncle has been a com plainant regarding his treatment since September last, vide accom paniment to report to Government of27th October last. He was first flogged till he confessed at the Fouj- dar's Police Court opposite the pa- lace, and after that he was flogged with the others at eleven places between 5 p.m . and 11 p.m ., on the ] 8th March, and got upwards of 100 lashes in all, for no fault whatever ! ! 1 This accused person appears to have been questioned regarding his supposed share in the alleged crime by selling poison. He has distinct ly denied the sale of any arsenic ; one has deposed that so; nor is he implicated accused persons. Notwithstanding this fact, the Sir Foujdar, Balvantrao Eshvant, has falsely stated in his de cision, which he produced as evidence and verified before the Commission, that Daji bin Hari Powarhad direct- ly implicated him by provingthe pur chase of arsenic from his (Ranchod's) shop. On referring, however, toDa- ji's statement, no allusion whatever is made to Ghanchi Ranchod, who thus appears to have been most un justly convicted by the Sir Foujdar, Balvantrao Eshvant, without any evidence against him whatever, to have been flogged through the streets of the city, and to have been imprisoned for life for no crime what ever, as is proved by the proceedings themselves. It is significant that this youth was suddenly liberated last (Septem ber, immediately after the receipt, by the Durbar, of the Resident's letter calling upon the Maharaja to reply to the Bombay Government ques tions regarding this case, which had been put to them so far back as April last It may also be added that this boy's name was not even mentioned in Durbar yad No. 2645, dated 9th of October last, copy of which was submitted to the Bombay Govern ment with Resident's letter No. ^ 09 ) dated 27th of October last.19 The following remarks are applicable to the finding of the Sir Foujdar, which has been recorded in this case. It would appear fiom this finding, that the eight persons charged were simultaneously tried by the Sir Foujdar on Tuesday the 18th of March last, for administering poison to Tatia Powar. It is a most significant fact that the com plaint of Lakshmi was only recorded on the very day that eight persons were tried, convicted, andpunished, and that the complainant himself has implicated one person only, namely Daji Kamati, instead of eight as finally charged and convicted. An examination of the different statement said to have been re corded by these eight accused persons, at different intervals during the eventful 18th of March, shows how the original complaint against Daji Kamati was magnified, so as to include no less than seven other persons. It has been shown that all of these eight persons at first emphatically denied all knowledge of the alleged crime, but that three of them, namely, Daji, Ganu, and Vithoba, were subsequently, by some means or other not apparent on the face of the proceedings, but of which the Resident is prepared to adduce evidence, induced to make a full confession. It has been already pointed out that, in the case of accused No. 8, Ghanchi Ranchod, the Sir Foujdar has deliberately cited as evidence against him the allegations by Daji, which were never in fact made, and that on the strength of this misrepresentation, has not hesitated to inflict on this accused a cruel and unmerited punishment.SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 40. j. Vithabae, wife of Kondaya, Mahratha, ISyears, labourer of Baroda, states —Last Shravan (August), I was taken from my house to serve in the Haveli, Gaekwar's palace, under the following circumstances. One morning, about 7 or 8 a.m ., my husband having gone out and I being alone in the house, 3 persons,—one Ghanu, a Government sepoy, a Gosai whose name I do not know, and an old man likewise unknown,—came to my house and said I was to go to the palace by order of the Sarkar. I refused to go stating that I was in my monthly courses. I resisted and begged to be let off, but they seized me and made me accompany them on foot through the streets. There were many people in the streets, but I did not cry out for help. What was the good ? What could they do against the Maharaj ? On arrival at the palace I was taken before the Maharaj, who having inspected me approved of me, and gave orders that I should be taken to his mistress, Lakshmibae, as a servant ' loun- di.' I was kept there for 7 or 8 days, when I was released, my husband having made a complaint to some Sahib in the Camp. During the time I was in the palace, I was not insulted or injured. There were sepoys on guard at Lakshmibae's apartments, and I was not allowed to go out without being followed by one of them. When I first went there, there were already some 10 or 12 other women 'loundis' there, and after I arrived, about 10 or 12 more were brought thither. On my release some 5 or 6 women were also let go, I remember Radha, Reva, Gaja, and Bhagirathi amongst them. No com pensation was given to me for being thus seized. I made no petition to be allowed to go home, nor did I cry out before the Maharaj. The whole thing was done so hurriedly, that I had no time to call out. I was just looked at, approved of, and sent off to Lakshmibae. The other women in the service of Lakshmibae told me they had been seized and carried off in the same way as I had been. The Durbar Agents have no questions to put, and state that they will make one general reply on the subject. Recalled. I identify the man Ghanu now produced as the sepoy who seized me. Ganpatrao Vithoba, Mahratha, 80 years. Government Halkari (Sepoy,) Baroda, states:— I know the woman Vithabae now present. I seized her about 3| months ago in her own house. There were with me Kasiram and Lakshman, both peons of the Senapati. It was about 10 a.m. I did this by the order of Govindrao, one of the Senapati's Karkuns, and one Damodhar, a private servant of the Maharaj Malharrao. When I had seized her I took her to the palace. The Maharaj asked her if she was willing to stay there, but she said she was not. The Maharaj then ordered her to be kept, and I handed her over to Wasant Ram Bhao. The woman resisted her seizure, and declined to come with us, but we took her nevertheless. I have taken 8 or 10 other women who had no guardians, but who con sented to go as servants to the palace. I have taken no woman against her will except this one. I understood that this woman was taken to be a servant in the palace. The Durbar decline to cross-examine. 2. Ujam, wife of Partap, 20 years, Barot of Baroda, states:—Last Shra van (August) being at my father's house on account of my being in my monthly n—40 acourses, I was seized by Government Sepoys in the following manner: — One day, about 10 a.m., 3 sepoys, having first been to my husband's house and failed to find me there, came to my father's house, and called for me, stating they had orders from the Maharaj to take me to the palace. They gave no explanation as to the reason of my being taken. My parents were in the house, as were many of my caste people, and they murmured loudly about my cap ture, saying it was contrary to law and custom thus to seize one of their caste. The'sepoys would not listen to what they said, and in spite of our remon- strances, they took me to the palace, followed by my father and mother. In front of the palace, my father persuaded them to let me go by a promise of Rs. 60. They accompanied me home, and released me on payment of the Rs. 60. I do not know the names of the sepoys, nor should I recognize them if I were to see them. Cross -examined by Gaehwar 's Neither I nor my father com- plained to the Maharaj about the bribe of Rs. 60 to the sepoys. I know they were Government sepoys because they said they were at the time of seizing me. Bapu Jethu, Barot, 45 years, Hereditary Genealogist ofBaroda, states : — The woman Ujam is my daughter. I was present in my house when she was seized by three Government sepoys. It was about 10 a.m . one day in last Shravan (August). What resistance could I make to the sepoys taking her away ? They took her to the palace, and there, in front of it, I persuaded them by an offer of Rs. 60 to let her go. They accompanied us home, and I paid them the money. My daughter being in her monthly courses had come to live at my house temporarily. I have made no complaint to the Maharaj about this. The sepoys had come from him. To whom or how could I make a complaint ? I do not know the sepoys, nor should I recognize them if I saw them. Cross-examined hy Gaekwar Agent. —I made my complaint to the Resident about this matter yesterday. I did not know till then that the Resident was taking complaints. I only heard it from general rumour. 3. Chandra Bhaga, Mahratta, 22 years, labourer of Baroda, states :— I live in the house of my mother. My mother is a servant in the house of one Ganpatrao. About 2^ months before the Dassera, I was one day weighing flour in Ganpatrao's house about 6 in the morning, when some 5 or 6 Government Sepoys accompanied by 2 Karkuns came there, and in spite of my resistance, my mother's cries and remonstrances, they took me to the Maharaj Malharrao in the palace. The Karkuns of the Maharaj said I had been brought to be made a servant of. The Maharaj said very good, take her to the queen, and I was thereupon taken to Malsabae, the queen, in whose service I remained 2^ months. My service consisted in washing and bathing her, fanning her, and such like occupations. I was not treated with any particular care. I was allowed to eat my bread, but I had no bed to sleep on. The queen did not illtreat me. She once saw me crying, and asked me the reason, when I told her I did not wish to be a servant in the palace. There were some 25 others there, old loundis, but I was the only new one. The queen did nothing in consequence of my crying. I was released 3 days after the .Dassera. I got no pay for my services. I have now gone back to my mother, I have had no compensation of any sort made to me. I left 2 or 3 saris in the palace which were given to me by the Rani. I have now no complaint to make. I was released on reports made to the Resident. No one else was released with me. I was taken by a Police peon to the Foujdari and there asked whether it was my wish to go to my mother s and on saying that it was, I was permitted to go./$ 9 / Kasi, mother of Chandra. I have heard the statement made by my daughter. It is true. She was apprehended in my presence, and taken to the palace, where she was kept for 2^ months. I petitioned the Resident, and at his instance my daughter was released. The Durbar reserve cross-examination. Chandra Bhaga, cross-examined by Durbar Agents, states :—I am not willing to go and live with my husband. He has turned me off for the last 16 or 17 years, and since then I have not lived with him. I do not know whether he has ever petitioned the Durbar to restore me to him. No deed of divorce was given to me when my husband threw me off. Reply of the Durbar. Females were never seized to be made loundis of by the Durbar. Ghanu Halkara had orders to find out such only as were willing to enter the service. Such of those he brought as were unwilling to serve were sent away. With regard to Vithahae's case.—The assertion by Ghanu that His Highness ordered this woman to be detained against her wish is false. With regard to Ujam. —No complaint having been made to the Durbar as to who brought her under arrest, and who extorted money from her, nothing is known of her case by the Durbar officials. If a complaint had been preferred, an inquiry would have been made. With reference to Chandra Bhaja —Her husband having made a petition for restitution of conjugal rights, and Chandra Bhaga having refused to live with him, she was at his request detained in the palace by the Senapati, to induce her to go back to her husband's house and nowhere else. She was released at the Resident's request. The husband's complaint remains undisposed of, and will have to be enquired into. No. 1096 of 1873. To T he P resident op the B aroda C ommission. 1873.

She is present. ^th.The statement of Balvantrao Ramaji, Brahman, a Karkun in the Residency, is also submitted. This matter has been so far settled that the girl has been received back by her husband, and she fears being excommunicated from caste if she comes forward now to reopen the case. In fact, as before stated by me, it was never anticipated that any of these cases would be brought before a Commission, or indeed any tribunal so constituted, and therefore when the object sought for was obtained by the liberation of each person, the case was looked upon as practically settled, though it was reported to Government for such notice as might be deemed necessary with a view to prevent the continuance of the practice.'i 4 In addition to the above four cases, the following are recorded:— 5th. Petition from a girl named Ganga who was released, present resi. dence unknown. Qth. Petition and Statement of Kashi, the mother of Chandra Bhaga and the statement of the latter ; both of these are present. 1th. The petition of Jagoba Jagtap, a relative of H.

Qth.Statement of Saku, wife of Ghanu Vithoba, one of the persons employed by the Durbar to seize women as loundies. He and two others broke into the house of a Junaghar woman of respectability who was staying in Baroda a month or two since. She complained of having been plundered of a good deal of property; a man servant was fortunately in the house, or she would have been carried off. She was compensated by Rs. 6()0 or thereabouts for her losses ; and left Baroda to return to Kattiawar. Ghanu and one or two others who were employed on this duty were punished by imprisonment at my request as stated by Saku, and they are still in jail. Ghanu could of course give valuable evidence if he chose. Qth. Statement of Jamna, wife ofShivlal Ganpatram, Brahman. This girl does not like to repeat this statement before the Commission from fear of being excommunicated from caste. 10^A. Statement of Raju, daughter of Bapuji Vanjara. In addition to the above, about 26 persons in a humble sphere of life (as per list given in the compilation) would probably state their cases at the Residency if accompanied by their friends; but before taking further steps in this matter, I would deferentially submit, for the consideration of the Commission, whether, in order to avoid the disgrace and scandal that must be entailed by publicly recording evidence in this class of cases, the Commis sion might not in the first instance call on the Durbar generally for their reply to the statement made in the Schedule, option being left to the Resident to call evidence, if required to rebut statements made by the Durbar. The Durbar might be required to answer the following questions :— 1. Under what circumstances were the women who have been released at the Resident's intercession seized and made loundis? 2. .Is it a fact that there are between 400 and 500 loundis altogether in employ in the Gaekwar's family in Baroda at the present moment? 3. In Durbar yad No. 1728, dated 22nd August last, it was that women were seized to serve as loundis against their will; how then can that denial be reconciled with the case of Kashibae's daughter Chandra Bhaga, and all the other eases which occurred before and after the 22nd August last? 1 have, &amp;c., (Signed) R. PHAYRE, Colonel, Resident. Final Statement by the Resident. Baroda, 2nd January 1874. In consequence^ of the Durbar having stated in their reply to the evidence on the subject of seizing women in Baroda recorded by the Commission ofl//o the 22nd ultimo, that ' females' were seized to be made ' loundis by the * The Gnvenimeiit Peon 'tbar, that Ganu Halkara * had orders to find out employed for the work. s J lcl1 onl y as were willing to enter the service, and , that such of those he brousrht as were unwillincr to serve orere sent away ; it becomes necessary to recapitulate the whole of the evidence on recoid, in addition to that taken by the Commission, in order to refute so unscrupulous and untenable a statement. N drifted 1 ' ep J )rt fe f ardin ^ this s y ste m was made in para. 14 of my letter No. 753, dated 18th of August last, and accompanying letter to His Highness the Gaekwar, and deposition of the Residency KarkSn Balvantrao Ramaji! Case.—-In that letter I showed His Highness that the wife of a Soni had been earned off by two of his own favorite followers, and that on the hus band applying to him (the Maharaja) for his wife to be restored to him H s Highness himself declined to accede to his request and sent her to sS've as a loundi. His Highness attempted to justify this act in his vad of the 22nd of August last on the plea that the woman said she had lost ij caste; did not wtsh to return to her husband; and that were she forcibly made over to h'm she would comnut suicide. Eventually the woman was restored to her husband' together with compensation for her jewels which had been stolen by the Ma harajas followers; and she is now living happily with her husband in spite of the Durbar's assertions regarding suicide, &amp;c. 1 Thus in the first case reported by me to Government, an equitable arrange, raent has been made whereas very different results might have occurred had the Maharaja persisted in depriving the Soni of his wife and 600 rupees' worth of jewels merely to make her a loundi. ^ a Case. The next case reported to the Maharaja was that of the daughter of a woman named Malsabae, the wife of a Jaghirdar in the territory of is Highness Holkar, who was reported to the Resident as having been seized by Government sepoys and carried off to the palace, that she had threatened to commit suicide rather than become a loundi, and that in consequence she had been frequently flogged. The reply which His Highness gave to this case in yad dated 22nd of August, is merely as follows : ' It appeared on enquiry on receipt of your yad that Malsabae's daughter is not willing to serve, and she has been immediately allowed to go.' It will be observed that no notice is taken by the Durbar abduction or the flogging, though the forcible detention is acknowledged and remedied, not spontaneously, hut on the Resident's intervention; yet in the presence of the Commission the deliberate statement is made by the Durbar that females are never seized to be made loundis of by them ; and that any unwilling to serve are immediately let go. 1 his woman Malsabae, and her daughter, had returned to their own country e ore the Commission arrived at Baroda, therefore they were not available for examination. th Case. —The 3rd Case reported was that of a girl named Vithabae, ne wife of Kondaji, who was seized by Government sepoys in her own house during the absence of her husband and was carried off to the palace to be niacte a loundi. The reply which His Highness gave about this case of e any forcible abduction, in the yad of the 22nd of August last, was the same s hat given above about Malsabae's daughter, viz., that it appeared after quay, on receipt of the Residency yad, that the girl was not willins* to e rve, and therefore she had been released. This girl subsequently gave her evidence before the Commission on the . Evidence before Commis -^th of December, and clearly showed that she was S10n - 1 ' taken against h palace and brought before the Maharaja himself who «« having inspected ji—40 dm e, approved of me, and gave orders I ^ Lakshmibae as a loundi *. 1 here were sepo&gt; s 8 followed by one loundis, there, and after I arrived some 10 The other womei 07™ release some 5 or 6 women were also let go * •. 1 he in the service of t^^'^'h^.^Th^eirfreeognized the Government sepoy the same way as I had been. i hisgnlrec g and Ganu himself Gann before the Commission as the man ^ ho s ;' z ^ ' verified her statement— Vide his evidence Case 40, Schedule ' Thus iu this instance also it is submitted ^^^'^d'TcUon forced service as loundis was in X'trhavt inscrnpnlonsly denied before of the Maharaja himself, yet the Duib' _ made loundis of, and the the Commission that females -XtThL' no' UUng t^serve are allowed to untrue assertion has been made that those not wuu &amp; S Afh Case—On the 25th of August I received a petition from a girl named 4m L^asewu tuc^uoii g, i j i v fUg g ar i (ar and sent as Bae Gapga, who complained that she had been s y ^ a loundi to Lakshmibae. ^ She I was able and refused to do Flogging Of women. what I could not. / was therefore flogged.

This drl turned out on enquiry to be the daughter of an old pensioned Non Commissioned Officer of Sappers. She obtained my protection and has, ^believ™ returned to her native place in the Deccan ; otherwise ^she would have appeared before the Commission to corroborate her statement. 5th Case —It has been already explained to the Commission in my letter No 1008 of the 8th of December, that the Residency Karkun's sister having been received back by her husband and the case already disposed of, she was unwilling to come forward to reopen the case. 6th Case Chandra Bhaga and her mother Kasi gave their evidence before the Commission on the' 10th of December, when the former showed clearly how she was seized by Government sepoys, and m spite of resisUnce, cries and remonstrances, was carried off to His Highness Mahaiaj Malharra , who personally ordered her to be taken to the Rani as a loundi, where sh was detained against her will for 2i months, and was at length released on the intervention of the Resident. With reeardto the case of this girl the Durbar attempted to make out in their reply to the Commission that she was Apparent false statement by seized at her husband's request and detained in t e Durbar before the Commission. p a i aC e by the Senapati to induce her to go back to her husband's house and nowhere else. This reply was given on the 22nd of December. In consequence of this statement of the Durbar it is examine the facts of this case of Chandra Bhaga as reported to Goveinment in my letter ^ 0 8 , dated 4th of October last, because the Durbar at the time treated it precisely as they had done those of Malsabae and others abov quoted ; and said nothing whatever about Chandra Bhaga having been seize on behalf of her husband, consequently the account given m Durbar/// mt: yad No. 2029 of 26th of September last, regarding this girl, and the statement made by the Durbar before the Commission concerning her, cannot be true. Her case as presented to Government in October is as follows:— On the 18th of September, notwithstanding all that had taken place with the Durbar regarding loundis about a month previously, I received a petition from Kasi, the mother of Chandra Bhaga, stating that her daughter had been described to the Maharaj as good looking and fit to be a loundi, whereupon some Government sepoys came to one Ganpatrao's house where she was at work and forcibly.carried off her daughter to be made a loundi. I forwarded this petition with yad No. 2211 of the same date, 18th Sep tember, to His Highness saying, that when I wrote to the Durbar a short time previously about girls being retained as loundi's against their will, the fact had been denied by the Durbar, and I requested trite the girl might be released, and the offenders punished. No reply having come by the 22nd idem, the old woman Kasi wrote another petition to the effect that the Durbar people were trying to pollute her daughter by giving her food cooked by a low caste woman in order to unfit her for any other service but that of loundi. This petition was also referred to the Durbar on the 22nd of September. On the 25th of September the girl herself appeared at the Residency accompanied by her mother, and stated how she had been seized by Govern ment peons and taken before the Maharaja himself, Gememan. who gave orders that I should be made a loundi. ' I represented that I was the daughter of a ' Grahasth' and was not willing to 'be made a loundi. Notwithstanding this the Maharaj directed me to go ' to the Rani. I wept bitterly and was sent against my will, &amp;c., &amp;c.' ' Next day Durbar yad No. 2029 of 26th September was received stating ' that as Kasibae's daughter has expressed her unwillingness to work, she ' has been sent back* to her mother. The statement made in the accompani- . Not he, husband nor .word ' to the Residency yad of 22nd September that about him. ' they are trying to pollute her daughter is false.' Thus it is clear that the actual grounds upon which this girl Chandra Bhaga was seized and released in September according to the evidence just quoted, are entirely different from those adopted by the Durbar before the Commis sion, a few days ago, viz., that it was ' at the request of her husband ' who it appeared had cast her off 16 or 17 years ago when she was a child. In short before the Commission the Durbar flatly deny that she was ever made a loundi at all!! whereas the yad of September the 26th above quoted admits the fact and releases her on the plea of unwillingness to serve. 1th Case.— On the 19th of December a respectable woman named Ujan, the wife of Partap, of the Bharot caste, appeared before the Commission and stated that in August last she had been seized by Seizure. Government sepoys, one of whom told her that he had orders from the Maharaj to take her to the palace. They gave no expla nation whatever as to the reason for seizing her. Amidst the remonstrances of her parents and many of her caste people, she was taken to the palace, before entering which the sepoys were persuaded to let her go on payment of a bribe of 60 Rupees. Her father corroborated this evidence. The following evidence of Saku, wife of Ganpatrao Vithoba Halkara, (witness No. 2 examined by the Commission in the Loundi case and now in prison), was offered by the Resident to the Commission, but not taken. The Resident considers it to be entirely reliable, and therefore of great import ance as auxiliary to the other evidence recorded.8 Deponent states on solemn affirmation that her husband* is employed in . , the Senapati's Kacheri, that she has been in prison about 3 months for seizing a certain girl named they robbed the woman. She Bhima, (from Junaghar in Kattywar) who was living received compensation and was i n a hired house near Sur Sagar Tank. States that ordered back to Kattywar. hus !)U ' ! d was employed with two others named Kashipuri and Lakshman llabe in seizing women in the city of Baroda for the Maharaj ; that within a short time her husband and the two others had taken upwards of 50 women to the palace, of whom 10 or 12 were married women living with their husbands, others are widows, others were women living away from their husbands, and some are loose women. The two following persons belonged to the street in which she lived, and were seized in her own presence, viz : — Igt,—Gaja, wife of Tukaram Morya—Good-looking girl of about 22 years of age, living with her husband. 2nd. —Kaushalya, daughter of one Paru, married to a man in the Huzur Paga, and living with him, aged about 20 years, and good-looking. Both of these women told her that theyhadbeen dishonoured in the palace. Witness states that on the day that her husband was imprisoned, the fifty women who had been seized by him and others also were released owing to the representations made by the Resident to the Maharaj. Witness knows that about 50 women were seized by her husband because Government sepoys used to go to her house, and order her husband to seize such and such a woman. The following evidence was also in possession of the Resident, but the girl who gave it was not willing to appear before the Commission, and it was not therefore pressed. Jamna, wife of Shivlal Ganpatram, Aodichh Brahmin, age 22 years, stated on solemn affirmation before the Resident, that about 3 months ago, as she was proceeding from her husband's house to her father's in the middle of the day, two Government men, one named Ganpat and another Bava, seized her and took her to the Haveli saying that the Sarkar wanted her. On arrival, they told her to sit down and went to report to the Maharaj. About 2 hours afterwards her husband came to the Haveli, but Ganpat and Bava turned him away denying that he was her husband. He therefore went away to bring a person to prove his relationship. In the meantime the said Ganpat dishonored her. In due time her husband brought a Khe- raval Brahmin named Gabad to prove his relationship. She was then allow ed to go with him, he being employed in British territory at the Nariad Railway station. In addition to the above the names and residence of 26 women are recorded in the Residency office, who were seized as loundies or for immoral purposes, and have been recently released. The compilation containing this extra evidence not recorded by the Commission was submitted to the President for perusal with letter No. 1082, dated the 3rd of December, and I, in that letter, took occasion to point out that feelings of shame and fear of disgrace and excommunication from caste prevented many from coming before the Commission who did not object to come to the Residency accompanied by their relatives. Subsequently to the above, and after the Durbar had made their state ment of 22nd December, two British female subjects from the Ratnagiri District appeared before the Commission and stated their cases, as fully set forth in Schedule I., Cases 12 and 13./ / «*) / / 9 One of these was a good-looking Shenvi Brahmin woman named Narangi, the wife of Vithoba Polekar, and the other Shenvi, the wife of Ganu, of the village of Sakarpa. Both gave clear and important evidence directly incul pating the Mahaiaja himself and his Minister Nana Sahib Kanvelkar in aidinp* and abetting and carrying on a system of enticing married women away from country villages of the British districts, using them for immoral purposes and then making loundis of them. The portion of their statement given to the Resident, which referred to their having been enticed away from their villages in the Ratnagiri District bv some servants of the Minister, who is a native of the village of Kora under Raja- pur, was not recorded by the Commission, in consequence of the enticement having taken place in British territory. Their story therefore commenced from the time of their arrival at the minister's house in Baroda together with * This shows the system. several other girls,' who had also accompli,led them from different places m British territory. It has been recorded, however, on evidence before the Commission: 1^.—That as British subjects, the Minister, Nana Sahib, and the Maharaja knowingly forced them to serve as loundis in the Maharaja's own household. 2wc?.—That as British subjects they were both unjustly thrown into prison without trial for no crime Compare the case of these girls with those of 34 and whatever, but simply because they 3b ot bchedule 11.,m which one girl of respectable i i* ^ i , / J . . i*yr i family, a companion of the Rani's, and the other a . , . accede to the Maha- loundi, were similarly treated for the same reason. raja's Wishes to become false ac cusers of certain persons. Srdly. —That having been thrown into Jail as British subjects, they have been illegally and unjustly detained for about 1^ years, during which time the Brahmin woman was twice flogged and the other one once. It is also important to mention here that in September last, the Resident having reason to believe that a number of British subjects were unjustly detained in the Baroda Jail, requested the Durbar to forward to him a list of them, showing their offence, sentence, &amp;c. The two women under notice, though British subjects, having been forcibly made loundis as such, were excluded from that list, yet in about a month afterwards they were released at no one's intercession on the occasion of the eclipse of the moon. The Durbar, in their statement of the 23rd December before the Commission, have made the bare unsupported assertion that both these victims of their system, were guilty of theft and hence their imprisonment; but it will not be difficult to disprove such a charge, and to show that, as already mentioned above, their cases are precisely the same as those of the two women mentioned in cases 34 and 36 of Schedule II. above quoted. In fact, I have reason to believe that the Durbar's own records contain nothing against the two women under notice, otherwise, in so serious a case they would no doubt have produced them, in corroboration of their bare statement before the Commission. Independently of the personal wrongs sustained by, and the personal redress due to, these women from the Durbar, it is submitted to the Commission for consideration that their evidence in addition to what has been already produced completely refutes the denial of the loundi system by the Durbar before the Commission on the 22nd of December, when they stated that females are never seized to be made loundis of by the Durbar; and that only such as are willing to enter the service are detained, the rest being allowed to go to their homes. Both the women in question are for the present under the Resident's Protection, agreeably to the recommendation of the President of the Com mission, pending a reference to Ratnagiri and final arrangements regarding them. n—40 c10 Before concluding this memo., it seems desirable to refer to the subject of the Government of India letter, No. 2609-P, dated 29th October 1873, and the Bombay Government letter No. 6864, dated 7th November last, upon the subject of the allegations regarding His Highness the Gaekwar made in the Hitechu (newspaper of Ahmedabad.) , My letter ^ , dated 24th September 1873, to the Bombay Government, was not brought forward, because the Commission declined, as a general rule, to go into cases affecting the personal acts of His Highness with regard to women ; even cases 33, 34 and 36 of Schedule II. were not gone into, the first named being one of the cases mentioned in the All there fore that I desire now to say with regard to this correspondence is, that whilst expressing my sincere regret that I should have displeased His Excel lency the Viceroy and Governor-General by undertaking it, yet I may with profound respect state that combined with my general protests in August and September last, it had the effect of putting a stop to the system of seizing respectable women for immoral purposes, and also of girls generally to serve as loundis, both of which practices had attained to such a height at the time, that the most respectable citizens of Baroda had actually begun to deport their wives and daughters into British territory ; and only ceased to do so when re-assured of British protection in their own houses under the protests which, as British Resident, I felt bound to make, against such cowardly and tyrannical proceedings on the part of the Gaekwar. I fully admit that, except under circumstances of extreme emergency, the course I adopted is not justifiable; and it is only the disgraceful state of things which I have described, and the failure of my personal advice, that led me to try it, for the good of an utterly defenceless people, who, under the presence of about 6,000 or 7,000 armed men, and an unscrupulous Police administration in the city of Baroda, are, or I should say were, held in a state of the most abject terror, which though somewhat abated is not even now altogether extinct.SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 41. In this case the complainant Baini appears before the Commission accompanied bj her brother, her husband being bed-ridden and unable to accompany her. Her statement, as recorded in the Resident's Schedule II., charging Balvantrao Trimbakrao, Vahivatdar ofVisnagar, with horrible torture of her in a Police enquiry case, is read out in the presence of the Commission and the Durbar Agents. The statement is not repeated here, but will be found in the said schedule. The Durbar Agent states, that immediately on the case being brought to their notice by the Resident, the Vahivatdar was suspended, and enquiry into the case instituted. They further say, that a close and searching investigation is now going on, and that, in the event of the charge being proved, a most exemplary punishment will be inflicted upon the Vahivatdar. The President expresses to the Durbar Agents his opinion that the complainant in this case should be taken special charge of by the Durbar while her grievous complaint is being investigated, and intimates that the Commission will expect, before closing- its proceedings, to be informed of the result of the investigation, and of the orders passed in the case. Further Statement of the Durbar. In continuation of our memorandum of yesterday's date, though sufficient evidence has not been obtained to warrant a judicial conviction, the Durbar cannot but entertain from all the circumstances of the case a reasonable presumption that the complainant must have suffered some violence. The Durbar have therefore resolved to dismiss the Vahivatdar and Kalji, and declare them both unfit for re-employment in His Highness' service. The Durbar will also give the complainant Rs. 200 as compensation. N ote— On the Members of the Commission visiting His Highness the Gaekwar before leaving Baroda, the Maharaja informed the President, that on a further consideration of this case he had decided to sentence the Vahivatdar to two years' imprisonment, besides declaring him disqualified for future employment in the public service of the State. Final Statement by the Resident. Case of Baini, a Brahman woman tortured at Visnagar. The facts of this very disgraceful case fully appear from the petitioner's statement which is given at length in the schedule. The Durbar have stated in their final answer dated 24th December that they have enquired into the case and ' though sufficient evidence has not been obtained to warrant a judicial conviction, the Durbar cannot but enter tain a reasonable presumption from all the circumstances of the case that the complainant must have suffered some violence.' The Vahivatdar has been therefore dismissed and has been declared unfit for re-employment in His Highness's service. The President of the Baroda Commission having publicly informed the Durbar Agents that justice appeared to have been defeated, and that the settlement of the case was most unsatisfactory, the Resident has only to add n—112 that the action taken by the Durbar in this case is a sample of what habitually occurs whenever the chief criminals are high officials in the service of the Durbar. The offender in this shameful case occupied the important position of Vahivatdar of the Visnagar Mahal, and was, as such, invested with full jurisdiction both civil and criminal. The Resident has on several occasions brought to the Durbar's notice the notorious behaviour of this very Balvant- rao Trimbak, but no notice whatever has been taken of his representations. This individual, who is said to be a protege of the Sir roujdar Balvantrao Eshvant, has served in several districts, in all of which numerous complaints have been made against him for every species of oppression and misconduct. While Vahivatdar of Bijapur he is said to have been formally dismissed by the late Maharaj, and to have been declared ineligible for further service. The Resident respectfully submits that it is employment of notoriously disgraceful characters like this man Balvantrao Trimbak, that has more than anything else tended to produce the present demoralisation of the Baroda Districts. The Resident submits it as his opinion that the practice of torture, of which the present case is merely an illustration, is not confined to one dis trict or another, but is systematically employed by the chief Durbar officials in all of the Baroda Mahals. The action taken 'by the Durbar in this case clearly proves that the crime is winked at as far as possible, and that even when glaring cases are prominently forced on the notice of the Durbar, yet the chief criminals are allowed to escape.SCHEDULE II. C ase N o . 42. Anandrao Viswasrao, brother of Maharani Jamnabae, widow His Highness Khanderao Gaekwar, at present residing in Poona, states:—His Highness Khanderao Maharaj, on his marriage to my sister Jamnabae, gave me sanads which I produce, granting me an allowance as follows :— Paga of 45 Sowars, Rs. 42,000 annually, and the Inam village of Megha Kua valued at Rs. 6,000 annually. (The sanads are admitted by the Durbar to be genuine, and show that the paga with allowance was granted to com plainant and his heirs in perpetuity, conditionally on his doing service. The village is granted in perpetuity without conditions attached.) I was in en joyment of these at Khanderao's death, and was deprived ot them, as well as of my 2 houses in Baroda valued at Rs. 83,600, about one year after the death of His Highness Khanderao. No reason was assigned for their con fiscation. I have done service to the Maharani since Khanderao's death, and I pray that my allowances, Inam villages, and houses may be restored to me. The Durbar Agents reserve their statement. 2. Manjulabae, wife of Kasirao, resident in Baroda, appearing by her husband, states : —I am the daughter of the late Maharaj Khanderao. I was deprived of my (Vada) house some 15 days after Khanderao s death, by the present Maharaj. It had been presented to me by my father, and I am unable to say what its value was. I was also deprived of jewels, ornaments, ^ :c *' amounting to about Rs. 75,000. I have twice asked forthemtobeiestoied to me, and on the second occasion I was distinctly told by Hariba Gaekwar that I should get nothing whatsoever. About a year after Khanderao s death, was, though I had just been confined, turned out of the house in which I was living, and compelled to go to another. All our furnituie and things were flung out into the streets, and we were compelled to leave the house. Another cause of complaint is that in spite of my remonstrances Wasant Ram Bhao is building a house on a plot of ground which belongs to me. claim to have this ground restored to me. 1 have an Inam village valued at Rs 5,150 assigned to me for my mainte nance. The Government has recently withdrawn the Havaldar and 5 Sepoys attached to it for its protection. The Durbar Agents reserve statements till the 20th instant. 3. Kasirao Ganpatrao Raje Sirke, resident in Baroda, statesIn I married Maniulabae, daughter of His Highness Khanderao, who promised at that time to make fitting arrangements for my support, and in the meanwhile gave me an annual allowance of^ Rupees 12,000. He ma e rangement, however, and 1 continued to enjoy this Rupees 1~, i , ^ rao's death. After that I received it for one year when it was reduced to Ru- pees 8,000; no reason being assigned for the reduction. His Highness Khanderao had given me one elephant with howdah and equipment of silver. Instead of taking the elephant, I took Rupees 3,000 and left the silver equipments in the Hathikhana where they now are. ii—42Government refuses to give them to me. I do not know whether or no they have bestowed them on any one else. I pray that my wife's ornaments, &amp;c and my allowances as stated above, may be restored to me. The Durbar Agents reserve statement. 4. Chimma Sahib Lakshmanrao, now resident in Oodeypoor, in the Rewa Kanta, states:—I am the maternal uncle of Ambabae, one of the widows of the late Khanderao Gaekwar. He increased my annual allowance of Rupees 500, (which had been granted to me by Seiajirao), to Rupees 2,400 annually. On his death the present Maharaj, Malharrao, stopped all the allowances of Khan- derao's relations, mine amongst them, and I consequently ran away to Oodey- poor, where I now reside. I have never asked the present Chief to give me the allowances back. I made no complaint to the Resident at the time. Who would listen to my complaint? 1 never had any sanad for these allowances. The Durbar Agents reserve statement. 5. Amratrao, son of Khanderao Maharaj, by Sakubae, now resident in Baroda, states:—My mother Sakubae was a mistress of the late Maharaja, and is now alive. She had an allowance of Rs. 32,000 annually, made up from an Inam village valued at Rs. 16,000, cash from Farnavis Rs. 9,000, and Rs 7,OJ(&gt; from the Mahals. I produce a f-anad (admitted by the Durbar Agents to be genuine) showing my mother's right to draw Rs. 9,000 annually from the Farnavis. I have no sanads about the other items of the Rs. 32,000. These allowances, together with my paga of 50 sowars, for which 1 had an allowance of Es. 35,000 annually, were continued for one year after His Highness Khanderao's death, when they were summarily resumed, no cause being shown therefor ; at the same time, my mother's jewels and ornaments, valued at 3 lakhs of rupees or thereabouts, and my garden, the Hirabagh, were taken from us. My paga has been given to Elajirao, the brother-in-law of Malharrao, and my garden to Nana Saheb Khanvelkar. We have absolutely nothing whatever left to us. I produce a sanad for my paga. (1 his is shown by the Durbar not to be a sanad but an annual assign ment for the paga). The Durbar Agents reserve their statement. Re-examined, states:—We used to have 16 sepoys who have been with drawn from us. We have been turned out of our house, and compelled to live in the house of one Narayenrao. An arrangement was made by khanderao Maharaj that on my marriage a suitable establishment should be provided for me. I was mariied a year ago, and no establishment has been assigned to me. I have also been for the last year forbidden to attend the Maharaja's Durbar. Reply of the Durbar. Anandrao being the brother of Jamnabae, the Queen of His Highness Khanderao, we have no confidence in him, and have discontinued his allow ances, and resumed his village. The house which he says was taken away from him was bought not by him but by the Government, and it was conse quently Government property. ManjulabaeThe house in which she lived was Government property, and on its being taken from her, another was given to her. With regard to the ornaments, they were State jewels and not her private property though she occasionally used them being of the royal family. Those ornaments//of ^ which form ed her marriage gifts were her sole peculium, and were not touched The plot of building ground which she clain/is Government property The Sghte 'r neVer ' ^ VilIaSe WaS given in K^yadan, (gift to a KasiraoThis man's allowance is fixed at the same rate as granted to sons-in-law of the late Ganpatrao Maharaj.

Sakubae, while His Highness Khanderao was alive, was, as his mistress, allowed to use the valuable State jewels. She has no ckira to them as private property, and it was only in accordance with custom that they have been deposited in the Jamdarkhana now. With regard to the allowances given to Sakubae, they are fixed at the same rate as those made to other mistresses of previous Gaekwars, viz between Rs. 7,000 and Rs. 8,000 for herself and son which they refuse to ac cept. 1 he garden is Grovernment property. The paga and allowances are dependent on service, which is not rendered by, or asked for from, Amratrao, and they have therefore been resumed. Final Statement by the Resident. The reasons assigned by the Durbar for their treatment of Anandrao Viswasrao, brother of Jamnabae, Rani of the late Khanderao Graekwar, have at any rate the merit of simplicity. It is clear, however, that if an alleged want of confidence be a sufficient ground for discontinuance of allowance and resumption of Inam villages, no person's property is safe in Baroda. The persecution to which the Rani Jamnabae, in common with all the followers and adherents of Khanderao, has been subjected at the hands of the present Maharaj, may indeed afford a legitimate ground for want of confidence on their part; but in the mouth of the Durbar the plea is only raised as an excuse for spoliation. Anandrao's house in Baroda is not Government but private pro perty ; he bought it himself, and held the deed of sale for it. The treatment of Manjulabae can scarcely be justified on the grounds asserted by the Durbar. The daughter of the late Maharaj was at least entitled to some sort of consideration, and the wholesale deprivation of jewels, ornaments, &amp;c., and the forced exchange of houses presents only a picture of the same vindictive spirit which has prompted the persecution of so many others of the late Maharaja's family and dependents. These remarks also apply to the case of Manjulabae's husband Kasirao, and to the remaining cases enu merated. The legal right of the Durbar to make the reduction, and resume the allowances of the relatives of the late Maharaj, is not called in question, but only the good faith and policy of the measures. There are so many proofs of a malicious and vindictive spirit on the part of the reigning Gaekwar in the treatment of H. H. Khanderao's family and followers, that the Resident has deemed it his duty to bring these cases to the notice of the Commission, in the 'ope that they will be able to make such representations as will cause the restoration of their property to those members of the Gaekwar family, who 'ave been unjustly deprived of it by the present Maharaj.SCHEDULE II.

The ca^p was not investigated by the Commission, because the complainant him- sclfw^snot present. The Resident begs, however, respectfully to submit that a Lo . f wei u advised Residen cy yad No. 2865 of 27th November j87o, to produce the petitioner before the Commission, and as no explanation has been afforded by the Durbar for his non-attendance, the facts stated in tuG oCllGCllllc must DG cllloWGd to SpGak fbr thGIBSGlvGS. 2. I he Commission will not fail to observe that this case affords another flagrant illustration of the systematic use of torture to extort confessions of supposed crimes. The Patan district has obtained an unenviable notoriety ior this special phase of crime, other examples of which are given in Cases 9, 10, 39 and 41 of this Schedule, and in Cases 4 and 10 of Schedule No. I. The Resident, moreover, deems it right to bring to the notice of the Commis sion that he received from one of the petitioners who appeared before him, infonnation of no less than 12 cases of similar torture practised in the Patan district, in which no investigation of any sort by the Durbar is said to have taken place. He was prepared to cite these cases before the Commission had it been necessary. * R. PHAYRE, Colonel, Resident. . Note. Phis was received after the case had been closed by the Com mission, and is filed with other cases in the same Schedule. a—&lt;44. - . - ■ — SBSCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 45. 1. Munshi Habibula Karimula, Musalman, 50 years, now of Ahmeda- bad, states : I was for 30 years the personal attendant of the late Khanderao Gaekwar. He gave me money, jewels value Rs. 35,000, clothes value Rs. 6,000, cash to the amount of Rs. 75,000. The total amount of his gifts was about Rs. 1,15,000. I had also houses in Baroda, the value of which was about Rs. 65,000. His Highness Khanderao also gave me in sis» an Inam village, Ranoli, valued at Rs. 4,000. I had a sanad for this, which was taken from me by the Karkun of Balvantrao Eshwant Foujdar. I had also another village, Lunadra, which I had bought with my brother Ghulam, from one Jibhai, a Bhat. The revenue of this village was within Rs. 2,200. I changed its name to Kadirpura. I also claim 8 months' arrears of pav due from Khanderao's time. F ^ On the very day that Khanderao Maharaj died, I and all my property were placed under attachment, and for 3 months everything was under ' chor japti,' i .e., if I wanted to open anything or get anything out, I had to do so in the presence of one of the Government sepoys. At the end of this time all my property and houses were placed under lock, seal and key, and I myself imprisoned in my own house. This lasted for 6 months. I was twice out of my house during those 9 months, once when I was sent for by Balvant rao Eshwant to give evidence in a case. My evidence was not taken, and I was sent back with a guard. The second time was when I went to the Maha raj, who forbade me to leave my house or to come into his presence again. At the end of the 9 months I was taken by the Government sepoys and offi cials to the Foujdari, where I was told by Balvantrao Eshwant, that I had committed some fault and must go to jail. I asked what my fault was, and was told that I had inflicted a fine improperly in my village. I represented that I was not in the village at the time stated, and was told that I was respon sible for whoever was there instead of me. I was then stripped of my clothes and hand-cuffed, and on asking Balvantrao whether I was to be imprisoned for life, he said no. My arms were then tied with a rope, and I was taken to the main jail. One day the Maharaja visited me in company with Hariba Gaekwar and others. Hariba abused me, and said that Bhao Sindia and I were both men in high honour with the late Gaekwar, and that we should soon go up—die. I shortly afterwards learned from going into the Jailor's office that my sentence was 6 months' imprisonment, and that the warrant had come. I was not set at liberty when my 6 months' term expired. I remained in jail for over 9 months, when I was called into the office, and told I should be released if I signed a paper to the effect that I would not go to Jamnabae, the wife of the late Maharaj; that I should not complain about myself; and that I would make no disturbance, (phitur), against the Government. The paper was in Gujerati, which I do not under stand, but its contents were explained to me, and I signed it voluntarily and freely. On my release, Balvantrao took me to the Resident, Colonel Shortt, having previously cautioned me to be careful of the consequences of my speech. Colonel Shortt asked if I really were Munshi Habibula; I said I was; when he remarked that the newspapers had reported both Bhao Sindia and me to be dead. I said that Bhao Sindia was dead, but that I was alive. He then asked how long I had been in prison. I refused to answer. The question was thrice repeated without reply. The Resident then asked n—45Ealvantrao Eshwant, who first said 6 months was the term, but that I had been in prion for 9 months. I was also asked if I had recognized any one on the road and replied that I had not, that I saw nobody now, and that I kept mv eyes on the ground all the time. Had I known that I was released by Colonel Shortt's intercession, and not by the Maharaja I would not have signed the paper mentioned above. When Malharrao Maharaj visited me in iail he asked how I was getting on. I said I was very well, and asked him to take care of my 4 small children. He said he would regar them and care for them as for his own •, but when 1 came out of jail, I found my house robbed and my property all gone. After my inte ^ vie ^ the Resident I returned on foot to my house in custody of a sepoy and remained there under surveillance for 25 days. When I told me to clear out in 4 days. I represented the difficulty of this and begged for 8 days, but got no reply. At the end of 25 days I got a pass or my brother self, and 4 servants to leave. We did so, and went to Ahmedabad, where we have lived since. My household remained here for the tim ®'^ ut months afterwards, I sent for them to Ahmedabad, wher e the y ai . have been deprived of all my property, villages, houses, jewels, &amp;c., and ha nothing but a few cooking' pVleft I have never committed any crime against the Maharaj. There never has been cause of dispute or quarrel between the Maharaj and myself. The Durbar Agents reserve cross -examination and reply. Reply of the Durbar. The village of Ranoli was given in Inam to the Munshi Habibula. He was sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment for concealment of crimes, and im position of heavy fines on ryots, and for other improper conduct in the exer cise of his authority in that village. It was also ordered that on his release from confinement he should find security for future good behaviour. He was detained till he o-ave it. The reason for taking him to Colonel Shortt was mere! v to show^that the newspaper reports about his death were incorrect. He was not abused in jail by Hariba Dada as alleged. Being ill-disposed towards Government, he and his brother were detained at home to prevent their intriguing. He belongs to the party unfavourable to the present Maharaj, and being of no use to him, his services were dispensed with, and his allowances and Inam village resumed. The village of Kadirpur has been attached pending an enquiry into the title of the person from whom he says he bought it. The houses and other property which he says he has been dispossessed of are Government property, and not his. He was on terms of very great intimacy with Bhao Smdia, who allowed him to misappropriate the Government property. His private property therefore, amounting to upwards of Rs. 27,000, has been taken possession of in satisfaction of the State claims upon him. Final Statement by the Resident. The explanation of the Durbar in the case of Munshi Habibula, No. 45, is so obviously unsatisfactory as to amount to no explanation at al . ot a single question was put to this witness in cross-examination, and the allegations of the Durbar are unsupported by any kind of evidence. Assuming that the petitioner was legally tried and convicted foi ''conceal- ' ment of crimes and for imposition of heavy fines on ryots, and foi o lei 'improper conduct,' nothing could have been simpler than to produce3 the proceedings of his trial, or to have questioned him before the Com mission regarding the alleged offences for which he was said to have been convicted. The omission to do so only tends to corroborate the petitioner's statement that he was thrown into prison on a nominal charge, and detained there pending the Maharaja's pleasure. Although the Durbar admit that the petitioner was sentenced to im prisonment for six months only, he was actually detained in prison for up wards of nine months. His release was only obtained through the accidental circumstance that his death was reported in one of the Bombay newspapers at the very time that public attention was directed to the sudden death of Bhao Sindia in prison. The petitioner was sent for by the Acting Resident, Col. Shortt, and was then set at liberty, security having been taken from a high Sardar named Ibrahim Ali that the petitioner British Government, and should have Jamnabae. The petitioner has solemnly stated before the Resident, and has repeated before the Commission, that while in confinement his life was openly threa tened by Hariba Gaekwar, who told him that both he and Bhao Sindia were doomed men. The important and circumstantial evidence which has been given by this petitioner regarding the circumstance attending the death of the late Bhao Sindia, shows at any rate that the petitioner has good grounds for believing that he would have shared the fate of Bhao Sindia but for the accidental circumstance which produced his release. The Resident would invite special attention to the explanation given by the Durbar for the confiscation of the petitioner's Inam village of Ranoli, viz., that the petitioner ' belongs to the party unfavourable to the present Maharaj, and being of no use to him, his services were dispensed with, and his allowances and Inam village resumed.' It is clear that a plea of this sort if allowed would place the property of every Inamdar at the disposal of the Maharaj. The allegation of the Durbar that Bhao Sindia allowed the petitioner to misappropriate Government property is unworthy of notice, as it is unsup ported by evidence of any kind, and is obviously an after thought to explain the confiscation of the petitioner's private property which the Durbar are pleased to value at Rs. 27,000 only, though the petitioner has valued it at Rs. 1,15,000. Inasmuch as the Durbar has intentionally deprived the petitioner of his private papers and of the means of proving the real value of the property confiscated, it is probable that the value of the petitioner's property greatly exceeds the amount stated by the Durbar, and in default of evidence to show that the petitioner has greatly exaggerated his claim, the maxim of ' Omnia presumantuv contra spoliatorem' appears applicable to this case. The same remark is applicable to the Durbar's allegation that the houses of which the petitioner has been dispossessed, and which the petitioner values at Rs. 65,000, are Durbar property. The petitioner's title deeds having been seized by the Durbar, he has been deprived of the legal means of establishing his claim. It is submitted that this case affords a glaring instance of the most wanton abuse of authority on the part of the present Maharaja. The petitioner was one of the late Maharaja's chief favourities and followers; he was a man of substance and respectability, and whatever else may be alleged against him, it is clear that he was guilty of nothing which could justify the shameful treat ment which he has received.// / SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 46. Chimnaji Lakshman Wagh, one of His Highness Khanderao's followers, named foi examination m connection with alleged spoliation, appears before the Commission, but at the special request of the Durbar Agents on the part of the Maharaj, the Resident intimates that he has assented to his withdrawal with out examination. Final Statement by the Resident. The facts of this case have been clearly set forth in the schedule. The petitioner was in attendance and ready for examination, but at the special request of the Durbar Agent the petitioner was not examined before the Commission. It has been shown from the official correspondence relating to this case which is quoted in the schedule, that conflicting reasons have been assigned by the Durbar for the imprisonment and sentence inflicted on this petitioner, and as no proceedings or other legal record of his trial has been produced, there can be little doubt that he has been treated in the same arbitrary way that most of Khanderao's principal followers have been treated. The petitioner, after having been imprisoned for upwards of 2^ years, and having been stripped of property amounting to about Rupees' 51,000^ was finally released in the month of November last. With reference to the case of this petitioner, it appears material to bring to the notice of the Commission, that in the month of July 1871 a somewhat remarkable petition from Chimnaya Wagh was forwarded by Government to the Resident, Colonel Barr, for report. This petition runs as follows:— It is given in extenso because it contains important allusions to two other of the late Maharaja's followers who were situated in the same position as the petitioner, by bringing to notice the violent death of Ganu Wagh which had just taken place, and by distinctly foretelling that ofBhao Sindhia, which took place within 9 months from the date of the petition. Substance of a petition of Chimnaya Wagh, formerly in the service of H, H. the late Khanderao Gaekwar, and at present in Godi Bazpur to H. E. the Governor, dated 15th and received and ordered to be translated on July 5th, 1871. n—462 .0 / o SCHEDULE 11. C ase N o . 47. Gulam Kadir Karimula, Musalman, 54 years, now residing in Ahmedabad, states-I am the elder brother of Munshi Habibula, and served the late Maharaj Khanderao for 25 years. I hold a sanad from him for the village of Khanpura valued at lis. 2,400 also for palki, I had a paga of 45 horses receiving Rs. 1,100 annually for them, and I also owned private property to a large extent. The whole of this, amounting in all to about Rs. 1,17,000, was taken away from me by the officers and sepoys of Malharrao, upon the death of Khanderao, for no reason assigned. I had also a half share in the village of Lunadra or Kadirpura valued at Rs. 2,200, with my brother. This also has been taken away by the present Government, and I am left quite destitute. I was kept in close custody in my own house here, not being allowed to go anywhere or do anything except under the charge of a sepoy. I was at the time Suba of Naosari, but came to Baroda 2 months before the death of Khanderao in consequence of sickness. I remained in the close custody specified for 19 months, andpfelien went to Ahmedabad with my brother when he was released from prison. I have lived in Ahmedabad ever since. Complainant produces a sanad, which the Gaekwar's Agents admit to be genuine. It bestows in Inam the village of Khanpura upon claimant and his heirs for ever. The Durbar Agents reserve cross-examination and statement. Reply of the Durbar. He was deprived of his allowances, &amp;c., for similar reasons to those mentioned in the case of MunsHi Habibula No. 45. Final Statement by the Resident. . The explanation of the Durbar in the case of Gulam Kadir Karimulla is more concise than satisfactory. The Durbar admits that he was deprived of his allowances, See., for sfmilar reasons to those mentioned in the case of his brother Habibula, viz., ' because he belonged to a party unfavourable to the present Maharaja and was of no use.' The only offence of which this peti tioner has been guilty is that he was a faithful servant of a former Gaekwar. For this serious offence he is now punished with confiscation of private property amounting to upwards of one lakh, exclusive of Inams and other property, besides being imprisoned for 19 months, without trial or charge of any kind. The petitioner occupied at Khanderao's death the important position of Suba of Naosari, and is a person of influence and respectability. It will be noticed that not a single questiorvwas asked this witness on cross-examination, and the substantial accuracy of the petitioner's statement may therefore be safely accepted. The facts of this case speak for themselves, and comment appears to be superfluous. n—47SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 48. 1. Eshvantrao Sakharam Mungekar, 42 years, of Baroda, states :—I was a personal attendant 'Jasod^ both of Seiaji and Khanderao, Gaekwars, for 25 years. 1 re A c ^ £ lft ; s from Khanderao amounting in all to Rupees 10,000 or Rupees 11,000. ^ amassed at the time of Khanderao's death some Ru pees 90,000. 1 had an allowance of Rupees 2,000 annually from Government. f On the old day after Khanderao's death I was imprisoned in my own house, and all my pioperty attached., I remained a prisoner at home for 6 months, and was then taken to the main Jail in Baroda^ where I was kept for 2^- years. My family made a petition to the Resident, at whose intercession I was released. I went to my house and found that I had been stripped of all ray propeity. It had been done since I was taken to the Jail, and who would take my goods but Malharrao Gaekwar ? I was sent to Jail by order of Balvantrao Eshvant Foujdar now present. He knows whether any complaint was made against me.^ 1 do not know of any fault or crime whatsoever that I have committed against the Government. I was sentenced by Balvantrao Eshvant to 7 years imprisonment, but I was not told upon what grounds or for what reason I was punished in this manner. The Durbar Agents reserve cross-examination and statement. Reply of the Durbar. He amassed large sums of money by falsely persuading His Highness Khanderao that he would procure the restoration to office of Bhao Sindia, and by making journeys to Bombay under the pretence of arranging this matter with Government. He was convicted of intriguing with Bhao Sindia, and sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment; but he has been released on the interces sion of the Resident, and on condition that he should leave the Baroda territories forthwith. His allegations about the Rs. 90,000 are unfounded. Bhao Sindia had given him large sums from Government and private sources. His house was not attached till long after Khanderao's death, and this time he was believed to have spent in concealing the treasure he had got from Government. It was with a view to make him refund this that his property, valued at Rs. 4,000, was attached and confiscated. Final Statement by the Resident. The explanation of the Durbar in the case of Eshvantrao Sakharam Mungekar cannot be accepted as satisfactory. The Durbar admits that the petitioner was convicted of intriguing with Bhao Sindia and was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment. The offence alleged to have been committed is conveniently vague. No proceedings have been produced, nor was a single question put to this witness in cross-examination. The Durbar admits that the petitioner had amassed large sums of money, and was in the confidence of the late Maharaja. It seems therefore rather inconsistent to have valued the petitioner's property at Rs. 4,000 instead of Rs. 90,000 as alleged by the petitioner. If the petitioner's property was liable to confiscation, it is superfluous to have now valued the property at a merely nominal figure. No reasonable doubt has been thrown by the Durbar on the substantial accuracy of the petitioner's statement. It seems clear that the petitioner has been thrown into prison on a nominal charge, and has been kept in confinement pending the Maharaja's pleasure, the whole of his property, which is very con siderable, having been confiscated. II—48J ■ SCHEDULE II. C ase N o . 49. Krishnaji Govindrao Jadav, 60 years, of Baroda, states:—I have been a personal attendant of the Gaek war's since the time of the death ofSeiaji Maharaj. I was Jemadar of the Chatriwalas at the time of Khanderao's death. I had at that time property worth Rs. 72,000 and houses worth something. I have no idea how much. About 6 weeks after Khanderao's death I was arrested one night and taken to the Fattehpur Chabutra, and next morning I was hand-cuffed and taken to the jail. I was told by the Khamdar (Bhujangrao) of the Foujdar that I was sentenced to 3 years' im prisonment on suspicion. I was not told the nature of the suspicion against me. I was confined in a solitary cell for 6 months. I was then for 4 months with the other prisoners, till one day the Maharaj cominground to see the jail observed me, and directed that one Eshvantrao, and one Chimanrao, should, as well as I, be confined in three separate cells. His order was obeyed, and 1 remained in this rigorous custody for 1 year and 10 months. I was released about months ago on the petition of my daughter to the Resident about me. On release I went home and stayed 15 days, when I was expelled summarily by the Government officials, and have since lived in the camp. All that remains to me and my family is the clothes we stand in. The Gaekwar's people have given an Inam to my servant Lakshman, who showed them where all my property was concealed. The Durbar Agents defer cross-examination and their statement. Reply of the Durbar. He was concerned in the attempt to burn down the Palace, and was after trial convicted and sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment. His property worth Rs. 2,000, not Rs, 72,000 as stated, was confiscated. Final Statement of the Resident. It must be assumed that the conviction and sentence of the petitioner Krishnaji Govindrao took place according to some recognized form of judicial procedure. Nothing could have been simpler than to produce the proceedings, or to have questioned the petitioner regarding the charge on which he is said to have been found guilty. The omission to produce any proceedings, or to ask a single question in cross-examination, tends to corroborate the petitioner's statement that he was thrown into prison without any legal formalities at all. The statement of the Durbar regarding the value of the petitioner's property is unsupported by evidence, and is entitled to no consideration. It is to be observed that no reason is assigned for the confiscation of the petitioner's property at all. If the confiscation was inflicted as part of legal sentence, there appears to be no reason for assigning a nominal value to a property which the petitioner himself has valued at Rs. 72,000. It appears clear that the petitioner has been thrown into prison on a nominal charge, and has been detained there several years pending the Maharaja's pleasure, the whole of the petitioner's very considerable property having been confiscated, and his family having been reduced to destitution. Under these circumstances, it is hoped that the Commission will be able to make some recommendation to Government, which will have the effect of relieving the petitioner from the pressure of absolute want. ii—49SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 50. Masukh Narsidas, Kanbi, 53 years, Vakil of Ahmedabad, states:—I have practised as a Vakil in the Baroda State for 13 or 14 years. In the year irMS^ 1 was employed by His Highness Khanderao to prosecute Balvantrao Eshwant, Hariba Dada, and Narayen Lalnbhai, The case being proved against Balvantrao he was imprisoned by Khanderao, but not being proved against the others, a second charge was being investigated when Khanderao died. I was in Ahmedabad at the time, but returned on the third day. On the sixth day, I was arrested and taken to the Foujdari, while my wife was detained in custody at my house. A few days after, my son-in-law came from Ahmedabad to give security for me, but Hariba Dada refused to take his security, and I was taken to a cell in the Foujdari and was imprisoned there for six months. I received my food from my house. I left the Foujdari four times during this period, and on three of these occasions Balvantrao Eshwant took my signature to depositions. On the 4th, Narayen Lallubhai took my signa ture on each and all of these occasions. I did not see what was written in the depositions. They were not read over to me, nor wereany witnesses examined in my presence. On the first occasion I was promised my liberty, on the 2nd and 3rd I was threatened with floggings, and on the 4th I was careless as to what I signed. At the expiration of six months, Balvantrao Eshwant sent me to the jail. I was not informed of what offence I was guilty, nor what my sen tence was. I was sent to the jail, and I only learned from the Jailor Bhojangrao that I had got 3 years. After about 3 months of this imprisonment Bhojang rao told me that my people had not given any further information about me, and that I should be released next day. I was set at liberty 4 or 5 days afterwards. I learned when I got out that my son-in-law had paid the fine of Rs. 15,000 imposed on me. Since my release I have lived in Ahraedabad. At my release a security bond was taken from me not to return to Baroda or to make any complaint.' I claim from the Durbar Rs. 25,000 for outstanding private debts, Rs. 15,000 for my fine, Rs. 5,000 for my private property con fiscated, Rs. 500 for my imprisonment, total Rs. 45,500. The Durbar Agents reserve cross -examination. Reply of the Durbar. Masukh was fined Rs. 15,000 on conviction of several offences, the chief being a conspiracy, chai'ging the Assistant Resident Captain Salmon with taking a bribe. His allegations that his signatures were taken to various papers without their being read to him is false, as will appear from the fact that when he objected to any particular sentence in his deposition, he has himself made corrections and initialled them. His property though under attachment has not been confiscated. It is still in his house, and we offer it to him if he will come and take it. The security has been taken only for his future good conduct, but not to prevent him preferring any complaint to the Durbar. With regard to his statement as to his wife being recalled from the sta tion, the truth is that she was leaving for Ahmedabad with her nazarana chits in favor of the Sarkar, and official papers. She was recalled, and when she gave up the papers she was allowed to depart. n—50Final Statement by the Resident. With reference to the explanation of the Durbar in the case of Masukh Narsidas, it must be pointed out that not a single question was put to this witness in cross-examination, and that the allegations of the Durbar are un supported by any kind of evidence, which could easily have been produced from their own records, had such evidence existed. It must be presumed that Masukh Narsidas was legally tried and con victed by a competent Court, and nothing could have been more simple than to produce the proceedings. The omission to do so tends to corroborate the petitioner's statement that he was thrown into prison without any trial. If the chief offence for which the petitioner was convicted was a conspi racy against the Assistant Resident, it is most extraordinary that no allusion to the case can be found on the Residency records. The fact indeed is so extraordinary as to make the Durbar's statement on this point unworthy of serious consideration. The statement of the Durbar that Masukh Narsidas himself made correc tions in his own depositions and initialled them, might easily have been cor roborated by producing the depositions and questioning the witness as to his own entries. The omission to do so cannot fail to prejudice the statement made. The Durbar admit that the petitioner's property has been attached, but deny that it has been confiscated. It is significant that no explanation of the attachment has been affordedthough the attachment in question has been in force for the last three years. The petitioner swears that he has twice formally requested the Durbar to be placed in possession of his property, and that his request has been distinctly refused. It is inconceivable that the petitioner would not have taken his property if he had had the chance, and the Durbar's present offer to the petitioner to receive his property ' if he will come and take it,' is under the circumstances rather significant. The nature of the security bond exacted from the petitioner might easily have been demonstrated by its production. The omission to do so tends to corroborate the petitioner's statement. The explanation of the Durbar of the treatment of the petitioner's wife is scarcely satisfactory. The petitioner has sworn that his wife was confined in her house for 6 months to prevent her from leaving Baroda, and was only released when the petitioner himself was thrown into Jail. The petitioner's wife being dead, the falsity of the Durbar's explanation is saved from decisive exposure. It is clear, however, that if the restoration of a paper be the only excuse for detaining the petitioner's wife that object could have been attained without confining her for six months. It will be observed that no explanation whatever is given of the peti tioner's most serious charge that he • himself was thrown into prison for 9 months without trial. Under these circumstances, it seems clear that the petitioner has a legiti mate grievance, and is justly entitled to damages in consideration of the great loss and injury which he has sustained at the hands of Balvantrao Eshwant, the Sir Foujdar, and other Durbar officials.r SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 51. Lakshmibae, widow of Malharbhao Shelki, resident of Baroda, statesMy late husband was a personal attendant and private servant of Khanderao Maha- raj. He was a servant of the Gaekwar's from the time of Ganpatrao, and had been employed for 40 years. About 10 days after Khanderao's death my husband was arrested, I do not know by whom, at the palace. I do not know why he was arrested. The same day our house was put under attachment, and I was strictly confined to the house. In a little over a month all our pro-, perty was taken away from the house, I do not know by whose orders or who the people were who took it away, I was ill at the time. The attach ment lasted 6 or 7 months, at the end of which time I was turned out. I do not know who has it now or to whom it was given. Nine months after my husband's arrest a sepoy came and informed me of his death in prison. I went there to take away the corpse. I made no enquiries as to his death. I noticed that his teeth had fallen out, and that his complexion, which was for merly light, was now livid and black. The body was slightly swollen and had an offensive smell. 1 have claims against the Durbar now, amounting in all to Rs. 1,29,000 comprising my husband's property which was confiscated, viz., cash, jewels, ornaments presented by Khanderao, and my house. There was also an Inam village Otia, revenue Rs. 2,500 annually. I have no sanad for it. That was taken away with everything else. I know no reason whatsoever for this treatment of my husband and me, or for taking away our property. I am left now utterly destitute. The Durbar Agents reserve statement. Reply of the Durbar. Complainant's husband was in charge of the Jamdar-Khana called Silleh- Khana, which had jewels in it deposited from the time of Seiaji. On the accession of His Highness Malharrao an account was demanded, and conscious of fraud and fearing exposure, he and Ghanu Wagh set fire to the Sille-Khana about February 1871, by which a portion of the property, and principally the accounts, were destroyed. He was convicted and sentenced to 9 years' im prisonment. His property valued at Rs. 25,000 and house were confiscated on account of the offences committed by him, and the losses caused thereby to Government. A portion of the building and a considerable quantity of the accounts and Government records were burned. SCHEDULE II. C ase No, 52. Bhagirathibai, widow of Ghanu Wagh, now resident in Baroda, states : My husband was a personal attendant of the late Khanderao Gaekwar for 5 or 6 J^ears, and had previously served preceding Gaekwars. My husband had personal property amounting to 3 lakhs of rupees or thereabouts, and an Inam village Beiranpur, the value of which I do not know. Some 15 days after Khanderao's death he was imprisoned and his house and property placed undei attachment. About 5 months after my husband was imprisoned, I heard he had died, and went with my relations to the jail to take charge of his corpse, n—51 &amp; 52I heard people say that he had been poisoned, but I do not know why they said so. The colour of the body was black after death ; whereas while my husband was alive he was of a light complexion. We took away the corpse. I am left now utterly destitute, having only my personal clothes. My house has been given to one Sheikji, the servant of Malharrao Maharaj. I do not know the value of the house. My garden, the value of which I do not know, is now in the possession of Balvantrao Eshwant Fouzdar. The Durbar reserve statement. Reply of the Durbar. For first part see previous case. The complainant's husband is the Ghanu Wagh there alluded to. The allegation as to 3 lakhs of property is false. Her property valued at Rs. 20,000, and consisting of ornaments, was taken possession of because he was found guilty. The house in which he lived was Government and not his private property. The garden was made at the Government expense and the Government therefore resumed it, and transferred it to the supervision and care of Balvantrao Eshwant. Final Statement by the Resident. The explanation of the Durbar in the case of the widows of Malharba Shelki and Ganu Wagh is obviously unsatisfactory as affording no explanation of the shameful treatment to which the petitioners have been personally subjected. Even if the husbands of these petitioners had been guilty of an alleged crime of which, however, no evidence has been produced, nothing has been proved against the widows, yet they have been turned out of house and home, and have been stripped of everything they possessed, having first been kept in confinement, without any legal justification whatever. The husbands of both of these petitioners were possessed of very considerable property, much ex ceeding in value the sums stated by the Durbar. If the confiscation of this property was inflicted as part of a legal sentence, there appears to be no good reason for assigning to the property, as the Durbar have done, a purely nominal value. The Commission will not fail to notice that no proceedings were pro duced of the trial either of Malharba Shelki*or of Ganu Wagh ; and that not a single question was put to either of the petitioners regarding the value of the property of their deceased husbands. It has already been brought to the notice of the Commission in my re marks under the head of Case No. 38, that both of the petitioners' husbands perished in prison under circumstances which led to the suspicion that they had been poisoned. Four persons who were with Ganu Wagh in prison have given evidence regarding the circumstances attending his death. They all state that something was given to him to eat which caused him soon to purge and vomit, and that he cried out aloud before all the prisoners that he had been poisoned. Ganu Wagh was taken away to the Raopura Chabutra, which is one of the subsidiary jails, and there died. Ganu Wagh's widow has stated that when she went to fetch away her husband's body she was accompanied by sepoys, which was a most unusual proceeding. She also states that the colour of the body was changed in an unnatural way. The widow of the late Malharba Shelki has stated that when her husband died in jail, she came to take his body away, and she noticed that the colour of the body was unnaturally changed, and that there was a most offensive smell. Taking all the circumstances of these cases into consideration, the Resi dent earnestly hopes that the Commission may be able to make some recom mendation to Government which will have the effect of alleviating the distress of these unfortunate women, and ofprocuring for them a sufficient maintenance./I h / ~c &lt;tJ SCHEDULE II. C ase N o . 53. Parvatibae, widow of the late Bhao Sindia, now residing in Devargam, Chandor Taluka, ofNasik Zillah, states :—On the third day after Khanderao's death my husband was arrested and confined in our house, which was placed under attachment. This continued for five months, when he was taken off to Jail, and our property, consisting of jewels, ornaments, gold and silver, cash, clothes, &amp;c., were taken possession of by the Government. On my husband's being taken to prison, Gangabae, his other wife, and I were taken to the temple of Umkareshwar where we were placed under strict guard, and allowed only our personal attendants to speak to. This lasted for about 17 months: i. e. till 5 months or so after my husband's death. He died about.a year after he was put into prison I think, but I am not sure. About 15 months ago we were released from the temple of Umkareshwar, when we were taken to the Residency by a Government Karkun whose name I do not know. The Resident asked us what our claim was, but I did not speak out as one of the Government officers, Eshvant or some such name,— I could recognise the man if I saw him,—had told us not to speak out, and thinking it would be better for us, and that by so doing we should be all the sooner released, I did not tell fully what had been done to us. It is the Fouzdar now sitting in the room, that I mean by Eshvant, After this interview with the Resident we were taken to the Railway Station and our fares paid to Bombay. Some 10 or 15 men accompanied us thither. I asked Gopalrao Myral about a sum of a lakh of rupees which my husband had deposited with him, and was told by him that I was to get nothing of it, that the Sarkar had taken it. After leaving Bombay I went to Poona, and thence to our Inam village of Devargam in Nasik Zilla, since which time we have lived there. This'village is the only property left to us to subsist upon. Even my Stridhan amounting to Rs. 5,00,000 or thereabouts has been taken by the Government. I have committed no fault or crime what soever that I know of to be punished in this way. I cannot say what is the value of my husband's property which was taken. My manager can tell, but I do not know. The Durbar Agents reserve statement. Reply of the Durbar. The misconduct of Bhao Sindia has become a subject of record in the Residency. He was guilty of numerous other crimes than those recorded. It was brought to the notice of the late Colonel Barr by His Highness Malharrao in conversation that Bhao Sindia had on various pretences taken away several sums of money, and ornaments. He was also responsible for unexpended balances of cash advanced to him for conducting the various departments of the State entrusted to his management, and the only way of recovering the large sums due by him was to seize his movable and im movable property. Colonel Barr replied that he felt sure from Bhao Sindia s attempt to corrupt Captain Salmon that he was capable of abusing the con fidence placed in him, and that he therefore saw no objection to his property being seized in satisfaction of the State claims. Thus property valued at Rs. 3,61,200 was seized and confiscated. The widows of Bhao Sindia when asked by Colonel Shortt, plainly told him that they had no complaint to prefer against His Highness Malharrao, and there is every reason to believe that Colonel Shortt has noted this in the Residency records. Reference tothese is therefore suggested. The widows must have been instigated by evil advisers now, to come forward and complain as they have done. The sum above named does not include the house of Bhao Sindia. Final Statement by the Resident. The widows of the late Bhao Sindia, ex-Minister of the Baroda State, have complained to the Resident of gross personal ill-treatment at the hands of the present Maharaja, and of the confiscation of all their private property in addition to that of their deceased husband. The widows were kept in confinement in Baroda for no less than 21 months, and were only eventually released under the direct orders of Government. Colonel Shortt, the Acting Resident, was directed by Government letter No. 4365 of 23rd July 1872, to see the widows in person without the intervention of any Durbar Agent, and to ascertain from them what their condition actually was, and what their wishes were. The widows have stated that thev were accompanied to the Residency by a Durbar Karkun and by Durbar peons,' and that before being admitted to see Colonel Shortt they were tutored by Balvantrao Eshwant, the Sir Foujdar, (who appears to be chiefly responsible for the shameful treatment to which they have been subjected; regarding the answers that they were to give to Colonel Shortt, and were threatened with future ill-treatment in case of their disclosing what had happened. Under the pressure thus put upon them the widows were compelled to conceal from Colonel Shortt, the gross ill-treatment to which they had been subjected, and to give a totally false account of their condition ; and Colonel Shortt was induced in consequence of this misrepiesentation, to write to Go- vernment a most misleading report regarding the real ciicumstances of these ladies. The Durbar give no explanation whatever of the attachment and confis cation of the private property of the petitioners, which, considering the position of their deceased husband and the intimate relation that he occupied with the late Maharaja must have been very considerable.* The case of these unfortunate ladies is one that the Resident would earnestly commend to the favourable notice of the Commission, suspi cious nature of the circumstances attending the death of the ex-minister in prison are already well known'. The late Bhao Sindia was possessed of very large property, considerably exceeding the amount stated by the Durbar to have been seized in satisfaction of the State claims, viz., Rupees 3,61,200. This property has been variously estimated at from 30 to 50 lakhs. The whole of the property was seized by the Durbar on the pretence of dividing it amongst Bhao Sindia s cieditois. This, however, has not been done, and the whole of this enormous property, together with that of the present petitioners , has been simply confiscated by the Durbar, while the widows have been reduced to destitution. The Resident trusts that the Commission will be able to make' such re presentations to Government on behalf ofthese unfortunate ladies as will place them, at all events in circumstances befitting their condition in life. It should be brought to the notice of the Commission that attempts have been made by the present Maharaja to deprive the petitioners of their Inam village of Devargam by repudiating the grant of the late Maharaja Khanderao. These attempts having proved unsuccessful, a suit has now been filed against the petitioners in''the Nasik Civil Court by Hari Bhagti, who is a ward of the Maharaja, and one of the chief of the late Bhao Sindia s creditors, which, if successful, will have the effect of depriving the petitioners of their sole remaining means of subsistence./ X. SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 54. 1. Meru Gaddhu, 40 years, Orderly of the late Maharaj Khauderao, states:—I was an Orderly of the late Khanderao for 10 years, in receipt of Rs. 9 per mensem. I have also served the present Maharaj in the same capa city for 3 months. At the end of that time, I was ordered to serve in one of the Regiments. After serving for one month, I was arrested at my house one night while asleep by Bapu Sahib, Sudaseo, a Karknn, and some peons, by whom I was taken to the Foujdari. The Foujdar Balvantrao was not then present, and we were kept in custody for 3 days in the Foujdari by the two persons abovenamed without any examination. On the fourth day Venkatrao Master and Bapu Sahib told us to make a statement, that either the Rani, Bhao Sindia, or the Munshi Habibula had got up a plot against the Sarkar, i.e. the Maharaj Malharrao. They promised me Rs. 500 down, and Rs. 100 a month to say so. I refused to make the statement demanded, and was con fined for 3 months in the Foujdari, attempts being made from time to time to induce me to make the statement. I was in separate quarters from Jesingh Jora and Fattehsingh Bhaiji, who had also been orderlies of the late Gaekwar. I do not know of my own knowledge what they said to them. The Durbar then fined me Rs. 500, and on my pleading my inability to pay it, they threatened to hang me. They told my relatives they would do so. My mother and wife petitioned the Foujdar in vain for a remission of the sentence, and at length the money was paid. I was in prison altogether for 4 months, and was released on payment of the fine. No one will employ me now. I want my Rs. 500 fine repaid and my restoration to Government Service. I paid the fine to Bapubhai and Sudaseo, the Karkun of Venkatrao. Cross-examined hy Durhar Agents-. —Bapubhai is the brother of Tarabae, one of the mistresses of Ganpatrao Maharaj. The Durbar Agents defer statement. 2. Fattehsing Bhaiji, 45 years, Orderly, now resident in Baroda, states;—I have heard the statement of Meru Gaddhu now given. My story is similar to his. I have served for 22 years, but in every other respect my story is the same as Meru's, and I pray that the fine of Rs. 500 which I paid to Bapu Sahib may be refunded, and that I may be re-employed. Cross-exaniined hy Duvbar Agents'. — I made no petition, after payment of the fine, to the Maharaja. Who would listen to me ? I made a petition a month ago to the Resident, but have made no other petition to any one. I made it now, because I heard that the Sahib would listen to petitions. The Durbar Agents defer reply. 3. Jesingh Jora, 40 years, late Orderly, now resident in Baroda, states precisely the same as the two previous witnesses, and desires the repayment of his fine and restitution to his place. The Durbar Agents defer answer. Reply of the Durbar Agents. Bapuji Gangadhar and Sudaseo deny having received the Rs. 500. If. however, the complainants prefer a regular charge before the Durbar, it wi he enquired into, ii—54\ Information having been received that the complainants jjwere getting up a conspiracy, they were arrested, but released for want of sufficient evidence. They were however considered untrustworthy and unfit for service, and were therefore discharged. The three Orderlies being confronted with Bapuji declare that this is the man they paid the fines to. He denies positively that he received any fine, and states that all he knows is that they were being tried by the Foujdar at the time. He had no official position with the Durbar which would authorize him to receive fines, his sole connexion with the Durbar being .that his sister had married a former Gaekwar Gunputrao. Final Statement by the Resident. The reply of the Durbar in this case merely amounts to a denial of the facts stated by the petitioners. The substantial accuracy of the facts so stated has been in no way shaken by the cross-examination to which the petitioners were subjected, and taking into consideration the risk which they incur in now coming forward to complain and the humble class to which they belong, the Resident feels no reasonable doubt that the story of the petitioners is substantially true. That the Durbar criminal authorities are in the habit of fabricating false evidence for the purpose of ruining all those who have had the misfortune to incur the displeasure of the present Maharaja is abundantly clear from numerous cases which it has been the painful duty of the Resident to bring to the notice of the Commission. Instances of this disgraceful system are shown in the case of Amba Tani and others No, 33, of Tani daughter of Lakshman Gupte No. 34, of Ramabae No. 36, of Manecklal Vittal No. 9 of Schedule I., of Laoji Umed No. 61, of Gan- patrao Gujar No, 55, of Sadakali No. 4, and in numerous others. It is respectfully submitted that the prevalence of this system is the main cause of the utter disorganization that prevails in the judicial administration of the Baroda State. In the present case the evidence of the three petitioners must be considered in connection with the treatment of the three persons against whom the malice of the Maharaj is alleged to have been directed. Bhao Sindia dies in prison under the most suspicious circumstances, after being stripped of everything which he possessed in the world. The Munshi Habibula having been stripped of everything and thrown into prison is only released through the accidental circumstance of his death being report ed in a public newspaper at a time when the public mind was agitated about Bhao Sindia's death. The Rani Jamnabae having been subjected to every species of indignity and having been deprived of everything except a pittance of Rs. 36,000 has been forced to appeal to the British Government for protection and maintenance, while the Durbar refuses to acknowledge her claim to any personal property whatever. The Resident has brought the case of these three petitioners to the notice of the Commission not so much for the sake of procuring them individual redress as of exposing a glaring in stance of an abuse which has tended more than anything else to demoralize the present administration and to endanger the relations between the Baroda and the British Government.SCHEDULE 11. C ase N o. 55. Ganpatiao Gangajiiao, Cxuzar, 60 years, states:—I have been a servant in the Haveli for the last 34 years. About 1 month after Khanderao's death I, being then in the employ of Revabae, daughter-in-law of Bhivabae, one of Seiajirao's mistresses, was arrested by a Jasod, Yadavrao, and taken to Hariba Gaekwar in the Haveli, who ordered me, without any enquiry whatsoever, to be imprisoned. I was then taken by sepoys to the Foujdari. Next day I was ironed and taken to jail. I did not know why. That day Sagaji Patel's son came to me, and told me to make a statement that either Malharba Shelki, Ghanu Vagh, or Khushaba Chatriwala had set fire to the shed in the Haveli. I declined to give false evidence. He then told me I should stay in jail till I died. Ten day afterwards the Foujdar Narayenrao Monghe repeated these threats, and received the same answer. About a month after, Daolatram, a Karkun in Narayenrao's office, also came, and repeated the same threats. I again refused to tell lies. No depositions were taken; no proceed ings held in my case. I was told when I was first imprisoned for what term I was to be confined, but I do not remember what it was. I was very ill, and did not understand the order when it was given. I was released about 1^ months ago by order of the Resident. My family petitioned him. The Durbar Agents decline to cross-examine, and defer their statement. Reply of the Durbar. He was tried and convicted on a charge of setting fire to the Haveli, and sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment. Final Statement by the Resident. With reference to the explanation of the Durbar in this case it is to be observed that if the trial was a legal trial, conducted according to any re cognized form of judicial procedure, nothing could have been simpler than to produce the proceedings, or to have questioned the petitioner regarding the charge of which he was said to have been convicted. The omission to take such obvious steps, deprives the Durbar's statement of any weight whatever. The Resident has good grounds for believing that the charge of setting fire to the Haveli is a wholly false charge, got up simply for the purpose of ruining certain followers of the late Maharaja, who were possessed of considerable property, and whose position in the Gaekwar's household had excited the cupidity of the present administration. The Resident respectfully submits the case of this petitioner to the notice of the Commission as one deserving of favourable consideration, should the question of damages be recommended to the Supreme Government.SCHEDULE II. Case No. 56. Complaints of 67 subordinate followers of the late Khanderao Gaek- war. I he complainants'grievances are: in 3 cases, confiscation of pro perty and deprivation of allowances; in 2 cases confiscation of property In the remaining 62 cases deprivation of personal and other allowances with loss of service in some of them without any fault on the part of the complainants. The Commission decides that it will be sufficient to record generally the giievances of this large number of complainants, the Durbar Agent beino 1 given the oppoitunity of offering any remarks thereon he may deem it proper to make. Reply of Durbar. The house in which Venayek Narayen resided did not belong to him. It was Government property, and as such was resumed. Its value is half that represented in the Schedule. This person being found untrustworthy, his nimnok was stopped and he was dismissed. These remarks apply to Nos. 2, 4 and 5. No. 3. In the time of His Highness Ganpatrao, he was.Chief Karbhari to the senior Rani, and the house in which he was living being Government property was resumed. As he was found unfit for service he was discharged, and his nimnok stopped. Nos. 6—67. The reasons for dismissal are as follows :— They were personal attendants of His Highness Khanderao, were not entrusted with public State duties; and on the accession of the present Maharaj it was not thought wise to continue such people in the service, and they were therefore discharged. Final Statement by the Resident. With reference to the cases of petitioners 1 to 5 the Durbar have denied that the houses taken from them are private property. All the petitioners have, however, produced their titles in the shape of deeds of sale formally countersigned by the responsible Durbar official. If formal titles of this sort are treated by the Durbar as mere waste paper, it is clear that the pro perty of any one can be appropriated by the Durbar whenever the Maharaj sees fit. The reasons assigned by the Durbar for the summary dismissal of the numerous followers without pension or remuneration of any kind are in the cases of Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5 'that they were found untrustworthy;' in the case of No. 3 ' that he was found unfit for service ;' in the case of 6 to 67 'that it was not thought advisable to continue such people in the service.' These explanations are sufficiently concise; they amount, however, to no more than this : that all these petitioners were dismissed because it was the pleasure of the present Maharaja, n—.w2 The case of these men has been submitted to the Commission for the purpose of illustrating the spirit in which the administration of the ruling vGaekwar has been systematically conducted from the time of Khanderao's death in November 1870. Every one connected with the late Gaekwar by v relationship or other tie has been remorselessly pursued, despoiled or disgraced by •-the present Gaekwar. No one who is not aware of the hereditary nature of service in the Gaekwar's household, and of the quasi-domestic tie thaft exists between the chief ruler and his household servants, will fully realise the significance of changing the personnel of a large establishment like that of the Gaekwar. Many of the persons dismissed have grown old in the service of former Gaekwars and their followers, and have served there before them. No fault of any kind is alleged against any of them, except that they do not enjoy the confidence of the present Maharaja. All of these persons are suddenly reduced to destitution, and are left without any hope of redress whatever./ SCHEDULE II. C ase N o . 57. Chunilal Bapubhai, 35 years, Sahukar, resident in Baroda, states:—I have an Inam village, Kajapur, revenue Rs. 1,200 annually. It was originally given to Samal, my greatuncle, by the Peshwa, and has remained in our possession since till p|, when it was attached by Malharrao Maharaj. The sanad granting this village is in the possession of Hari Bhagti, to whose family I belong. No reason whatsoever was given for attaching the village, and I know no reason whatsoever for the Government doing so. The Inam villages of other bankers were all attached at the same time. The Durbar have asked for my sanad, and I have told them it was deposited with Hari Bhagti. I pray that my Inam village be restored. The Durbar Agents reserve statement. Reply of the Durbar. The reason for attaching the village is the same as that given in Hari Bhagti's case. Final Statement by the Resident. The Durbar state that the reason for attaching the village is the same as that given in Hari Bhagti's case, viz., ' that all debts owing to bankers having been cleared off, there was no reason to continue these grants.' The sanad of the petitioner is an hereditary sanad, and no condition is attached to it. The village now attached has been in the petitioner's family since the Peshwa's time, and the attachment of it under present circumstances simply amounts to spoliation. The Resident respectfully hopes that the Commission will be able to make such representation as will have the effect of restoring the petitioner's village. ii—57SCHEDULE II. C ase N o . 58. Bapabhai Harivalabh, 31 years, ShrofFand Banker of Baroda, states:— My father had an Inam village Gamdiby name, revenue about Rs. 2,500, given to him by Seiaji Maharaj many years ago. I cannot state in what year, I produce the sanad (acknowledged by the Durbar Agents to be genuine) granting the village in perpetuity and hereditarily to my father. It was attached by the Maharaja Malharrao in ^without cause assigned. I know no reason whatever why it was so attached. I had also a palki allowance of Rs. 1,392 annually, which was stopped in the same year- for no cause whatsoever. I produce two sanads for this. (The Durbar Agents remark, 1st, that these sanads are not hereditary grants, and 2nd, that they do not bear the signature of the Maharaj, but of the Vahivatdar). The Durbar Agents reserve their statement. Reply of the Durbar. See previous case. Final Statement by the Resident. The circumstances of this case are almost entirely similar to the foregoing case. The Durbar have given precisely the same explanation as in the case of Chunilal Bapubhai, and the same rejoinder as was given in that case is applicable to the present case. The Resident respectfully hopes that the Commission will be able to make such representations as will have the effect of restoring the petitioner's village. ii—58SCHEDULE 11. C ase N o. 59. Mahadavrao bin Godaji, 17 years, residing in Baroda. In H. H Khanderao gave my father the Inam village of Maletha, revenue'Rs. 5,000 or thereabouts, for service done. It was granted in perpetuity. I produce the sanad (acknowledged by the Durbar Agents to be genuine, and granting the village in perpetuity, hereditarily.) My father died in ^ and the village has been since enjoyed by me till -g when H. H. Malharrao deprived me of it, and gave it to Govindrao Mama (now present as one of H. H.'s Agents). No reason was assigned for taking it from me, nor can I tell why I was de prived of it. Ina palki allowance of Rs. 600 was granted to my father hereditarily and in perpetuity. I produce the sanad (admitted by the Durbar to be a genuine grant from Khanderao giving this palki allowance here ditarily and in perpetuity). It was taken from me also in I know no reason for depriving me of it, nor was any assigned to me for so doing. I have made no written petition to have these restored to me except to the Re sident. Who would listen to me if I did ? The Durbar Agents have no cross-examination to make, but reserve statement. Reply of the Durbar. The village was held by complainant's father on service tenure. As a servant he was required and expected to be honest. He was, however, found to have been guilty of receiving bribes, and to have caused extensive loss to the State in the works entrusted to him. The village was therefore resumed and the allowance stopped. Having proved himself to be untrustworthy, he was unfit for further employ. The frauds were discovered on examination of the accounts after the accession of the present Maharaj. Final Statement by the Resident. The Resident would respectfully submit that the explanation of the Dur bar in this case is open to various comment. The petitioner's village was granted to his father in 1861, by the late Maharaj Khanderao. The alleged frauds were not discovered by the present Maharaja till 1871, or ten years later when the original grantee had been dead 8 years, and the village had been enjoyed peaceably by the unoffending son, the present petitioner. The sanad is an hereditary sanad conferring the village absolutely, and not on service tenure, as incorrectly stated by the Durbar. The arbitrary resumption of palki allowances is unexplained. The peti tioner is one of the numerous persons whose chief sin appears to be that they were in the enjoyment of favours derived from the late Maharaja. It is respectfully hoped that the Commissioners will be able to make such repre sentations as will have the effect of restoring the petitioner's village. ii—59SCHEDULE 11. C ase N o. 61. Laoji Umed, 50 years, Gumasta of Chunilal Dalcharam, of Baroda, states: — Chunilal is a money-lender and banker, having branches of his establishment in Bombay, Ahmedabad, Dholera, Visnagar, Pahlanpur, and Patan. He has been on bad terms with Balvantrao Eshvant, the Sir Foujdar, since 1 ? 23 . In I ° 28 , jan7» by order of Balvantrao, our house and bank here were placed under attachment, and our records and papers taken to his house. I was confined to my house, and in 2 or 3 days was sent for by Balvantrao, who told me to make a statement that Bhao Sindia had deposited the sum of Rs. 5,000 to the credit of one Prema Ichha. I refused to do it, saying I did not even know Bhao Sindia. He then threatened me with imprisonment and fetters, and under pressure of these threats I signed a written statement. What was in it I do not know, as I did not read it. Four or five days after I signed a similar paper under similar compulsion, but I do not know what was written in that. Four or five months after, in I™ Balvantrao Eshvant again called me, and said that I was fined Rs. 15,000. I refused to pay the fine, whereupon he said he would order my debtors not to pay me what they owed. He did so, and 1 am now out of pocket Rs. 17,000 which my debtors refuse to pay without the sanction of the Durbar. My house and branch in Visnagar also were attached. The Visnagar attachment was removed 3 months afterwards, in consequence of the head of the firm complaining to the Bombay Government, who directed the Resident to enquire into the matter. On his report the attachment was removed. Three months after this the attachment on the Baroda branch was also removed, and I was released from con finement to my house, having first given security for Rs. 15,000 not to leave Baroda. My security was Masukh Hargovind. I have not paid the fine inflicted on me. My house and the branches of the bank are now released from attachment,-and my prayer now is, 1st, that I may be allowed to collect my debts of Rs. 17,000 and carry on my business without interference, 2nd that the fine of Rs. 15,000 may be remitted, and 3rd, that the security given by Masukh may be cancelled. I received the papers and records attached and taken from the Baroda branch 11 years after they were first taken, and those from the Visnagar branch 3 years afterwards. The Durbar defers its statement. Reply of the Durbar. Bhao Sindia being desirous to establish a charge of bribery against Cap tain Salmon, induced the complainant to make a false entry of Rupees 5,000 in his account book. When this was brought to the notice of the Durbar an enquiry was made, and it was found that Masukh Narsingh was the principal agent, Laoji Umed being only his abettor, and that his own accounts were tampered with. We intended to fine Laoji. He offered to pay Rupees 5,000 0 n condition that he might be permitted to recover the debts, payments of which was stopped by order of the Durbar. We are ready now to take his Rupees 5,000 as fine, and grant the permission he desires. The security bond will only be in force till the fine is paid. 11—6IThe assertions that he was forcibly made to sign certain statements, and that L wasTept in durance are untruef His signatures were all voluntary. Final Statement by the Resident. The reply of the Durbar in this case is neither intelligible or satisfactory. It is unconceivable that if the prisoner was c0 .^ vl f case spiracy against Captain Salmon, the Assistant Resident no f 1 ' s ' on ^ t d shouMbf found on the Residency records. Bhao Sin^a is ^ ^ by the Durbar as being the principal in the conspiracy. It is subseq y stated that Masukh Narsingh was the principal agent. _ The Durbar state that they intended to fine the petitioner for share in the alleged conspiracy. Why this intention was not carried out does not appear! The peSner, however, states that he was confined to his house for 10 months fined Rs. 15,000, forced to sign false papers under threats of violence from Balvantrao Eshv^nt, Foujdar. and that his debtors ^f^CZ bar their debts to his firm, by which he has suffered grievous loss. Ihe Durbar admit that the petitioner was prohibited from recovenng his e s in^ aro^a. This prohibition has now continued for upwaids of 2 2 yeais, a amount ofRs. 40,000 are stiU outstanding, whUe the peMioneris^not allowe^ leave Baroda without the permission of the authorities. The Resident respe - fully submits that an illegal prohibition of this sort is absolutely unjustifiable savouring more of private malice than of ordinary P 1 ® f ^ o h statement of the Durbar that they are ready now to take Rs. 5,000 petitioner as a fine and to grant the permission which he reqiines, is under Uie circumstances utterly®preposterous. If the Rs. 5,000 by a competent Durbar authority, it is most extraordin y petitioner has been able for 2| years to set the Durbar at defiance, and Resist the payment of this fine: The petitioner himself attributes the whole of the proceedings against him to the private malice of Balvantrao Eshvant Fouidar, and states that the fine in question was not a legal fine imposed by competent authority which he had no power to resist, but was a mere act of spite on the part of the Foujdar unsupported by any legal justification what- ever. The Resident respectfully submits this case to the notice of the Com mission as one that shows how completely unfit are the present criminal authorities, and how especially the Sir Foujdar BalvantraoEshvantto admin- ister iustice or to exercise jurisdiction of any kind. The defence of the Sir Fouidar by the Durbar shows how completely the whole administration is pledged to the existing system, and how absolutely impossible it is to obtain justice when the chief officers of the Durbar are the principal offenders.SCHEDULE II. I Case No. 62. Chunilal Pitambar, 2o years, Banker ofBaroda, states:—father was Hari Bhagti's Gumashta for 12 years, and died in J-fV I was Hari Bhagti's Gumashta for one year when I was discharged. In Malharrao borrow- ed Rs. 1,281-4-0 from my father for his expenses, depositing a gold watch and a 'chit' as security for the loan. On Malharrao's accession, he demand ed the watch and chit from me, my father being dead. I took them to him, and he told me that Raoji Athvalia would pay me. I went to Raoji who would give me nothing. On returning to Malharrao, he himself told me I should get nothing at all. I had a torch allowance of Rs. 72 annually, granted by Anandrao Gaekwar ; a palki allowance of Rs. 700 annually, given by Seiajirao in J||~; an In am village Fajalpur, revenue Rs. 2,000 annually, given by Khanderao; and hold sanads for all three. I have not brought my sanads, having left them at home. These were all resumed in ~ , by Malharrao for no reason or cause shown. I desire to have them restored to me. I have not petitioned the Maharaja to restore my village and allowances to me. The only person I have petitioned is the present Resident. The Durbar Agents decline cross-examination and defer statement. Reply of the Durbar. The village was granted to complainant's father, Pitambar, inconsequence of his having been the Munim of the Sirsuba's treasury, and was resumed on his death. The palki and torch allowances were conferred on him as Hari Bhagti's Munim, and when the banker's allowances were resumed, this was taken up with them. His allegation that PI. H. Malharrao had a loan of Rs. 1,200 from him on security of a watch is untrue. Final Statement by the Resident, The explanation of the Durbar in this case would be satisfactory enough, if the petitioner's sanad were a life sanad only. It is, however, an hereditary sanad without any condition attached. The explanation of the Durbar regarding the resumption of the petitioner's palki and torch allowances can hardly be considered as satisfactory when considered in connection with Hari Bhagti's case. The fact that Hari Bhagti has been similarly despoiled cannot justify the present treatment of this petitioner. With reference to the Durbar's explanation of the alleged loan to the present Maharaja, it is significant that no questions were put to the petitioner in cross-examination, and that his statement having been publicly given and subject to cross-examination, is entitled to more weight than a bare denial by the Durbar unsupported by any sanction whatever. ii—62SCHEDULE II. Case No. 64. Flogging Women and Reform in Baroda Jail. The case as set forth in the Schedule is explained to the Durbar Agents, who promise to make a statement on the subject. Statement of the Durbar. In regard to female prisoners it is not customary to divest them of their clothes and flog them. Should any officer be guilty of such misconduct he is punished on conviction. In caseoffemale prisoners refusing to grind grain in the Jail, it was usual to correct them gently with a stick. This practice has now, however, been altogether discontinued. It was left off 2 months ago or thereabouts. The woman from Visnagar has appeared ; the other from Patau has not, because the Bhats say they would never allow their women to go up. The Residency Surgeon has never visited the Baroda Jail. The Resident has occasionally, having given previous notice to the Durbar, but not to make any enquiries about, or from, prisoners. Proper arrangements exist about the registration roll of prisoners, and subsistence money. il—C4SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 65. Shankraji Shivram, 55 years, cultivator of Veshma, in Naosari Pargana, states: About 24 or 25 days ago, 94 men of the Naosari Purgana determined to make a petition to the Commissioners, but someone must have gone to the thana and revealed our intention, for the night before we were to start sepoys were sent to all the villages, and men were seized. Four sepoys came at midnight to my village, bringing two or three men whom they had seized. I managed to get out of the way, and have come up here. The object of arresting us was to prevent us making this petition . The Durbar reserve cross-examination. Cross-examined by Durbar.—The petition of the 94 men alluded to above is now with the Resident. We were previously oppressed in the levying of nazaranas, &amp;c. Reply of the Durbar. We never issued any order to stop petitioners coming up. We never knew even that there had been any difficulty put in the way of their coming, and it was certainly without our sanction if such a thing were done. When the Resident brought to the notice of the Maharaj that people had made a petition to the effect that they were not allowed to come up to state their grievances, we issued an order directing the Vahivatdar to throw no obstacle in the way of petitioners. We do not know if the order were verbal or written. ii—Co/3 ^ / SCHEDULE II. C ase N o. 66. Statement of the Durbar. Bhao Sindhia's creditors and estate. The property is not worth from 30 to 50 lakhs as alleged. It is under 5 lakhs. From this we shall first deduct the State claim of Rs. 1,21,223 and Court Fees Rs. 22,656 and divide the balance amongst his creditors. So far as we can judge there will be no surplus ; but should there be any, His Highness will have no objection to handing it over to the widows. With reference to the discrepancy between the value of the estate as entered in the Schedule and declared by us, we would say that it is a notorious fact that Bhao Sindhia while in power remitted large sums to his native place, and further that having received agrant of two Inam villages from the Gaekwar, he got them exchanged for the village of Devargam in Nasik Zilla in order that it might be beyond the reach of the Maharaja. Final Statement by the Resident. The Durbar state that the value of the late Bhao Sindhia's property amounts only to 5 lakhs instead of from 30 to 50 as stated in the Schedule. No evidence of any kind has been adduced by the Durbar to support the truth of this statement, which is contradicted by the evidence not only of Bhao Sindhia's widows, but of every one whom the Resident has consulted on the subject. It is in fact notorious in Baroda that the late Bhao Sindhia was enormously wealthy, and this fact is not denied by the Durbar, who explain, however, that large sums were remitted by Bhao Sindhia to his native place in Nasik. It is true that a sum of one lakh of rupees was deposited in Bombay, in the house of Gopalrao Myral, in the name of Bhao Sindhia's wives. This sum has, however, been withheld by the Durbar, and a suit for the amount is now pending in the High Court. With the exception of this sum of one lakh of rupees no money appears to have been remitted by the late Bhao Sindhia from Baroda. The widows have solemnly declared that with the exception of Bhao Sindhia's Inam village of Devargam, they have been deprived of every thing which they possessed, and in order to dispossess them of this last remain ing property, one of Bhao Sindhia's chief creditors named Hari Bhagti has been instigated to file a suit in the Nasik Civil Court, although the whole of Bhao Sindhia's property was originally attached to meet the claims of creditors which have never been satisfied. Bhao Sindhia's widows have represented that the whole of their deceased husband's papers having been seized by the Durbar, and most of his confiden tial servants being restrained by fear of the Durbar from giving any assistance, they are effectually prevented from proving the real amount of the late Bhao Sindhia's property. They pray that all their papers may be restored, and that all the persons who were acquainted with the late Bhao Sindhia s piivate cii- cumstances may be called and examined. A list of these persons has been given. It 'will be observed that although the late Bhao Sindhia died on 1st May 1872, the Durbar admit that no disposal has yet been made of his effects. In the explanation which was given by the Durbar of the treatment of Bhao Sindhia's widows (case 53) it was stated that property valued at Rs. 3 ,61,200 was seized and confiscated in satisfaction of the State claims. In the present explanation the State claims are stated at Rs. 1,21,223. It will n—669 also be observed that Court Fees to the amount of Es. 22,656 are entered by the Durbar as a charge against the late Bhao Sindhia's estate. It is not stated on what account these fees have been incurred, but it is presumed that the fees in question are institution fees payable by those creditors who have filed suits against Bhao Sindhia's estate. Such fees are ordinarily paid in advance, and are paid not by the estate, but by the parties who have suits to file. From the fact, however, that suits have been filed and decrees passed without any institution fees having been paid, and that not a single one of the said decrees have yet been satisfied though the property was attached shortly after the death ofKhanderao in November 1870, it seems clear that the proceedings in question were intended merely as an excuse for confiscat- ing the whole of Bhao Sindhia's property. The Resident respectfully submits it as his opinion that the ruin of Bhao Sindhia as of all the other principal followers ofKhanderao, was mainly effected for the purpose of spoliation, and that the statements of the Durbar as to the amount of property they confiscated are absolutely unreliable. On behalf of the widows and of the bona fide creditors of the late Bhao Sindhia it is res pectfully submitted that the Durbar should be required to produce all the documents that may be in their possession relating to the estate of the late Bhao Sindhia, and that the whole case should be submitted to some independ ent authority for equitable adjudication./2y SCHEDULE No. III. Case No. 1. Case of Motilal Samal. Extracts from deposition of Balaji Grovindlal, present head of the Firm, vide Sardar's cases, Deposition 21 Balaji Govindlal states :—I appear as representative of Motilal Samal, deceased, the bankers of Baroda, Ahmedabad, Surat, and Bombay. I am his son-in-law. He died 2 or 3 months ago from grief, and has left a son 5 years old. I am now the representative of the firm. Our firm originally belonged to Ahmedabad. Samal was the founder of the firm 100 or 125 years ago. After Samal, came Motilal and Harilal in a.d. 1829. The whole of these allowances were stopped 15 months ago by Malharrao, the present G-aekwar. The ostensible ground for stopping them was a false claim for debts owed to the State for 50 years past. He claimed Rs. 1,25,000 in all from us. Out of this sum he said he found from our books Rs. 64,000 owing to the State. He took away our books, and has since kept them in his own possession. We do not admit the debt at all. The Nana Sahib has, however, since settled this with us, and we have no complaint to' make about it. There was a second item of Rs. 50,000 which Nana Sahib has now settled, and we have no quarrel about that. There remains but one item of Rs. 20,000 which the present Govern ment claims as a Court fee on a suit for Rs. 3,84,000, which we have brought against Bechar Nathu in the First Court of the G-aekwar. Khanderao, however, exempted us from the fee, and directed that the suit should proceed without fees being taken. We therefore now object to pay the money. The total amount now due to us by the Sardars, Silledars, &amp;c., is about 15 lakhs of rupees. This amount I claim that the Gaekwar's Government should assist me in recovering from these Sardars and Silledars by deducting the amount due to us from their pay. All the private property of the firm which was in Gaekwari territory has been attached. I cannot say what was the value of it. Motilal went to Ahme dabad on urgent business about 15 months ago. The day after he left, his pro perty and everything was attached, and he remained in Ahmedabad till he came down to Baroda about 6 months ago. He then stayed in camp, as I said before, for 4 months, and died after an illness of a few days in Ahmedabad, to which place he returned when he first fell ill. I succeeded him in the business and am new to it. We have lost lakhs of rupees from this, and have been forced to close our banks in Ahmedabad, Surat, and Bombay. No one will do any business with us now we have lost our credit. Reply of the Durbar. We divide our answer into 6heads — 1st.—With reference to the confiscation of his Inam village, we state that it was given to the firm at a time when it had had extensive dealings with the Government, and when large sums were due to the bankers. It was given in part satisfaction of the Government debts. When the village was resumed the Government did so, considering, from an examination of its own accounts, that the debt had been paid in full, and that there was no necessity for continuing the grant any longer. The Bank's books were not compared with those of the State. The bankers did not appear for this purpose. 2nd.—With reference to the confiscation of the Sepoy ' Nimnok,' {vide Sch. II., Case 1, Deposition 21,) the Government considered that Motilal having left Baroda without permission, was no longer a State servant, and that it had therefore the right to resume the establishment. in—12 3n?.—Motilal having gone away from Baroda without leave, and there being no one in charge of his .shops and property in Baroda, they were put under attachment. Locks and seals were put on, but no list of property was made out. Information was given to the Resident 6 or 7 months ago that Motilal was at liberty to come and take possession of his property, but he never came. Mh. —The payments of sums guaranteed by the Government will be made according to the terms of the guarantee. 5tJi,—The fees demanded from Motilal were usual, and such as it is customary to demand in the cases of suitors in the Civil Courts. We deny that Khanderao ever forgave the fees as alleged. QtJi, The Gaekwar's Agents further state that in Khanderao's time the question arose as to whether or no the State bankers should be allowed to bring actions on plain paper or not, and that in several instances it was decided that they shouldnot. Final Statement by Resident. 1872. This case was transferred to Schedule III. by the Commission. 2 The present representative of the Firm, Balaji Govindlal, of Ahmedabad, was examined, on the part of the Minor, by the Commission, amongst the Sardars (vide case No. 21), in consequence of the paga of 62 horses m the Kattiawar Contingent having been arbitrarily confiscated by the Durbar. 3. I have not received from the Commission a copy of the Durbar s reply to this statement No. 21, but I heard it delivered, and have a general idea of its tenor. 4 The complete case, however, as set forth in Schedule III., Case 1, has not been enquired into. There the character of the Gaekwar's^ personal treat ment of the old Banker Motilal Samal (since dead) is fully set forth. 5. According to His Highness Malharrao's own account he found on his accession to the throne in the beginning of 1871 that the State was 2 crores of rupees in debt, and it appears that one of the many modes which His Highness adopted of paying off that debt was to close accounts with the old State Banks, and open Government ones in Baroda, Bombay, and Surat. It seems, however, that though these State Bank accounts were closed, all, as a rule, were not settled, for it is seen in the case under notice, that as an initiatory measure His Highness at first endeavoured to make Motilal Samal pay him a sum of 1J lakhs of rupees in full of all demands, which was afterwards reduced to Rs. 75,000. This arbitrary and summary mode of settlement having been resisted as unjust by the_ Banker, His Highness deliberately commenced to ruin the firm, by attaching their immense household and other property, ignoring hona fide State debts and responsibilities,* and finally confiscating Inams, Nimnoks, Pagas, &amp;c. 6. Were this an isolated case of such treatment some doubt might arise regarding the truth of it, but when considered in connection with the general toSe of the present Gaekwar's rule in confiscating the property of all classes without just grounds, its reality' may be accepted as matter of fact and is uttei y unjustifiable. 7. During the last 8 months every effort has been made by the Resident to obtain a fair settlement of accounts, but without success, and it is on record m this office that the Mukhtiar who went to the Durbar, in Septembei 1872, to * Money lent to Sardars and others on Government Security./3g 3 settle these accounts, was detained in custody at the palace, in order, as usual, to force him to yield to the Durbar demands. He was however released under a protest made by Col. Shortt. 8. With regard to the Inam villages held by the firm, the Durbar have in formed the Commission that they were confiscated as a matter of course on the cessation of the State's connection with the firm,—thus implying that such con fiscation was customary under previous Gaekwars. I am assured that this is not the case, and that several instances of Bankers retaining their Inams after their business connection with the State had ceased, can be quoted. In some instances these grants were made by the Peshwa and not by the Gfaekwar. Moreover, they were for good service already performed, and not connected in any way with current monetary transactions. A reference to Case 57 of Schedule II. will shew valuable evidence on this subject. In point of fact. His Highness Malharrao is the first Gaekwar who has treated the Banking and Mercantile classes in the manner set forth in this and Case No. 37 of Schedule II. and others. 9. It is a significant fact that the Durbar has made no attempt to refute the serious evidence recorded in Case 1, Schedule III., and therefore it is submit ted that the main facts therein set forth may be considered as fully proved; if not, the witnesses are present.SCHEDULE III. Case No. 4. Amta Ranchod, Banker, formerly of Baroda, now of Bombay, states :—I was formerly a Gaekwari subject, but on the 8th September 1869 I took the oaths of allegiance to the British Government, and became a naturalised British subject under Act XXX. (Bombay) of 1852, the certificate of which I now produce. In idii? I was imprisoned, and my house and bank attached by H. H. Khanderao, on account of my not handing over certain property to my mother, which she claimed. I was imprisoned for 4 months, and on my release in -^rws» the attachment on my hank was removed. I went to Bombay, and, having lived there the requisite time, made the Statutory declaration, and became a British subject as stated above. When I was imprisoned, certain jewels of mine valued at Ks.35,000, and ' chits' of Government for Rs. 25,000, in all Rs. 60,000, were taken possession of by the Gaekwar. My house, but not my bank, in Baroda remained under attachment till ; when His Highness Khanderao visited Bombay, and at my petition promised to remove the attachment if I returned to Baroda. I therefore did so, but had to go shortly after on urgent business to Bombay. In the meanwhile, my Gumasta received back the jewels, but reported that some, to the value of Rs. 4,000, were absent. I refused to receive them back, unless they were given back in full, and acting on a letter of my Gumasta's, I proceeded to Baroda, and had an interview with H. H. Khanderao, who 2 months before his death gave orders that all my jewels, &amp;c., should be replaced in my house, and the attachment removed. Before his orders were carried out His Highness Khanderao died, and I went_ to Bombay. Returning thence about 3 months afterwards, and my house being still under attachment, I petitioned His Highness Malharrao, who at once took back the property which had been placed in my house, and continued the attachment thereof. This attachment continued in all for 5 years, viz., from 1867 to 1 872, wlien, at the instance of the Resident. Colonel Barr, it was removed, but the Rs 60,000 worth of iewels and 'chits' were not restored tome. I estimate further tha. in these 5 years I have suffered a loss of about Rs. 75,000 from cessation of my profits, and interest, in the banking business, my money and property being under attachment, and I myself being absent in Bombay. X n svt. iq-w ^ Balvantrao Raholkar, the Naib Dewan of H. H. the Gaekwar, depo sited R s .T o 000 with me at interest, and took my chit for the amount. In the following year H. H. Malharrao demanded the whole of this sum from me and on my declmmg to give it up unless I got mj ' ohit' back, he attached the bank and house of mylelf and partner Gordhan, and kept them under attachment for 4 months, when, at the request of the Resident, on payment of the ® s - the return of mv ' chit' to me, the attachment was removed. We have sufteied losses of Rs. 13,000 or 14,000 from this second attachment of our banking business. The Durbar reserve cross -examination. Reply of the Durbar. From the nroceedinffs held during the administration of H. H. Khanderao, it appears that^ the final decision was In favour of ^anikuvar (the st«p-m^her of Amtabhai) admitting her claim for Rs, 50,181 against ;, In a. 0 ' ^f ance with this decilion, Rs. 30,413 m cash and ornaments of f ® of Rs, 19,768, were given to her from the estate of Amtabhai. had been thus enforced, the late Maharaj subsequently got back the jewels from in—42 Manikuvar, and deposited tliem with Amtabhai under guard. Manikuvar having made a complaint to the present Maharaj, and there being no reason for withhold ing them, they were restored to her. The arbitrary and unjust treatment of this Banker has resulted in losses to himself and his firm which he estimates atRs. 75,000 and Rs. 18,000respectively. The Durbar do not attempt any reply to this part of complainant's case. They merely state that Rs. 50,000 worth of property has been returned to his mother-in- law contrary to the decision of H. H. the (iaekwar on the case, but when this was returned, whether within the last month or not, is not stated. The Resident submits for the consideration of the Commission that Amta Ranchod has established a prima facie case for full enquiry, with a view to obtaining compensation from the Final Statement of the Resident. Gaekwar.SCHEDULE III. Case No. 5. m A'l-. Balva ^ rao Ganesh, Brahman, 35 years, Merchant of Bombay, states •— My at er was Ganesh Sadaseo, and entered the service of the G-aekwari Govern ^■^and wS e then 3 ra F* ^P 10 ^ . in the office from a . u . im .'- so ' c o _ roade Farna\is, in which position he remained till for lyeai ^*? hk in T — ***£&amp; n j , s, he in J- returned on Tambekar s dismissal, and was made Dewan, which place he held till §» when he retired. In R-jjg, in considera- toon of his excellent services, generally during the mutiny, and specially in the matter ef having the Gaekwar's Government relieved of the annual payment of 3 lakhs of rupees to the British Government, H. H. Khanderao eonferred upon fiTinnnn him the village of Davat in Baroda pargana, valued at Es. 10,000 annually, m perpetuity to him and his heirs for ever, and specially de claring that whether the revenue realized became more or less, the difference was to belong to my father and his heirs, and not to the Government. This sanad I pro- due®. (f he Gaekwar s Agents admit the genuineness of the seals and signa- tore of the sanad.) My father retired in and died in !|?, during which tune he enjoyed the village. In the following year, Khanderao Maharaj attached the village on the ground that it was worth much more than the Rs. 10 000 at which nominal value it had been originally given. He also demanded back the original sanad and said that he would give us a fresh one for a village really worth Rs. 10,000, but by the advice of Colonel Barr we kept our sanad and all Sf P^P 61 ^' /h 0 attachment of the village continued till Khanderao's death, in m . ±1.

The surplus, amounting to Rs. 43,200-15-0 we paid to H. H. as a nazarana. One instalment of that year |||[, amounting to Rs. 6,400, had been collected when the village was restored, and that also was given back to us. Next year on the news of Colonel Barr's death being received, H. H. Maiharrao once more attached the village on the original ground lat its value exceeded the Rs. 10,000 at which it had been granted. il f f/ 16 P ewan went Colonel Phayre, the present Resident, and telling him ! Ks. 10,000 was to be continued to us, has attached the whole village. We lave received nothing whatsoever from it during the past year. the ^ ie ^ ur ' :)ar have no questions to put, but promise a statement on Statement of the Durbar. We beg to hand in a written statement in reply of the case. Instead of the written statement alluded to above, the Durbar Agent makes 6 Allowing statement verbally :■— R itV? 6 ^ ie ^ railt ^ ie revenue of the village was not Rs. 10,000, but s - ~,750.

Final Statement by the Resident. 1873. The full particulars of this case are given in Schedule III., the most promi- n SIS (Government makes a grant of its own free will, the fact ts itself a gua rantee for its continuanee, because whatever yonr Highness has ever given can- not be taken back.' r -n . ^ The rRr itTlordt^: To.O ^hThLte ^snlt fo. 0 Thrvillage +n pollect the revenue m kina, ana pnoeis uoia &amp; j accounted for but it was not the normal revenue. Indeed, according to the average of 5 or 10 years which it is usual to take as a guide in such cases, tl JiUagl was not more than Rs. 10,000 value when it was granted to the minister. The case of the village of Konah which has been cited by the Durbar as a precedent in point has no analogy whatever with this case. It was granted as nart pavment of a palki allowance which, as exceeded Rs. 1,100 pei anmLAll excess therefore of that amount was ordered to be paid to the Durbar for some years before Ganeshpant came into power. This payment ot excess revenue fraudulently ceased, but was discovered by Ganeshpant after a lapse of about 25 years, and a refund of deficient payment was then ordered to The instance of Govindrao Rohre, which has been cited by the Durbar to show that the resumption of Inams is not uncommon jSlote —The widow of Go- un der Gaekwar rule, merely shews on what a P 1 '®' Tindrao Rohre has protested cal .j ous tenure the most distinguished servants of the against this resumption. Gaekwar Government have held hereditary honours and orants that are conferred upon them. No truer sign of want of fixity of prmciple and good faith can exist than this, and it is submitted that the fruits there are fully apparent in the present disorganized condition of the Gaekwar State,3 It is an element which is at work under the present Gaekwar in no ordinary manner, as the general attachment, or it may be said confiscation of all Vatans and the wholesale spoliation of the Inams of Bankers, Sardars, &amp;c.j fully testify, and we therefore trust that it may now be put a stop to. Under the general head bardars it will be necessary to offer a few remarks upon this subject in consequence of what the Durbar have submitted to the Com mission in their General Statement of 24th December 1873; in the meantime, the Resident trusts that the Commission will uphold the valuable principle inculcated by Earl Canning, viz., that (except for some offence against the State) whatever the Gaekwar Government have given of its own free will, as set forth in Balvantrao Ganesh's sanad, cannot be taken back.SCHEDULE III. ' Case JSTo. 7. Bhanabliai Lalbhai, r ^'' is ,^ lll ^ ai ^-o en ^ whom the complainant's case has been read over in the latter s presence, states, that he is authorized to inform the Commission—ls^ that his claim on account of the boundary stones supplied for the survey of jNaosan shall be at once enquired into by the Durbar, and disposed of with as little delay as possible, and that such sum as is fairly payable to complainant on that account shall be disbursed to him. Quel,As regai ds his claim to the vatan of which he alleges he was deprived in 1865, the same shall be duly enquired into, and if substantiated, the vatan shall be restored to him. Final Statement by the Resident. 1873. Transferred to Schedule III., Case No. where a full statement of it is re corded, showing that it was the Gaekwar Grovernment which, in refused to settle claimant's account, unless he signed a paper for a sum, of which he was only to receive half. It is submitted that this refusal on the part of the Durbar has been the cause of the ten years' delay, and the loss and ruin that has overtaken the claimant; hence their obligation to make reparation as soon as possible. 2. The Durbar in their statement of 17th instant before the Commission, have made fair promises, but the claimant Bhanabhai has only a day or two since assured me that although, agreeable to the advice given him by the Commission, he has frequently attended at the Revenue Sirsuba's office to have his account settled, he has been turned away by the officials there ; and that he can get nothing done. 3. A reasonable time will be given before the Durbar's delay in fulfilling their promise is taken notice of. 4. It is worthy of notice that the main facts recorded have not been called in question by the Durbar; and without accepting the large charges made by the claimant as actually correct, still it is submitted as clearly proved that the case generally affords an instance of arbitrary evasion of just responsibilities, which, had they been met in 1863, as they ought to have been according to the written agreement, the contractor would not have been so thoroughly ruined and perse cuted as he appears to have been, both in the matter of his account and of his vatan. 5. It is this spirit of retaliation and revenge for complaining to the British authorities, which has brought' business to a stand-still ' with the Gaekwar Government, as Colonel Barton has happily expressed it; and I fear that if it is left optional with His Highness to do justice, or not, in matters where British merchants, bankers, and contractors are concerned, they will fail to obtain their reasonably just dues. hi—7SCHEDULE III. C ase N o. 8. Jefcuram OcKhavram appears before the Commission and states, that his bro ther Fattehram, late Foujdar of Patanj is now in prison under sentence of the Foujdar, having been convicted of torture. On consideration of this case the Commission decide not to take the deposi tion of this Jeturam, as it appears that the original Foujdar Fattehram has himself made no complaint in the matter. The Durbar Agents having had the case explained to them, state that they will defer their remarks on Fattehram's case. The Durbar's remarks will be found on referring to the case of Parbhudas Parshotam, Schedule I., Case No. 10. in—8mj/ Qy p./ SCHEDULE III. C ase N o. 10. Vasudev Shivram, Parblm, 48 years, of Baroda, states:—In I agreed to take the Valiivat of the Kural Mahal for 5 years. The Jamabandi thereof was about Rs. 1,06,000 annually, and I agreed to pay the Sarkar Rs. 2,000 more as Jama bandi than had previously been paid. I knew that in the survey formerly made many ryots held lands unauthorizedly, from having bribed the Vahivatdar not to enter them as holding land. I intended to revise this survey, and so to realize the Rs. 2,000 extra. Nana Sahib Khanvelkar signed my appointment as Vahivatdar. In addition to the agreement above stated, I promised to pay Nana Sahib Rs. 2,000 'Sukdi' for himself. This 'Sukdi' was a private payment, and was made to him to induce him to give me the place of Vahivatdar, and it was not till I had paid my Rs. 2,000 ' Sukdi' to him that he signed my appointment. I expected to recover this money also, by my revision of survey and entry of ryots who were unauthorizedly cultivating land. At the time of payment to Nana Sahib, there were present Nana Saheb Khanvelkar, and on his behalf Govindrao Laksh- man, Bhaskar Pant, and Balvantrao. On my part appeared Khanderao Esh- vant and one Gopal. The money was paid in cash into the hands of Bhaskar Pant, the Nana's Karkun. I saw no entry of this payment made in any account book. I got no receipt for it. I had two or three other matters on hand, and I therefore did not go to my Mahal for 4 or 5 months. I merely sent my agent to conduct the business. I took from the Sarsubha, when I did go, surveying chains, &amp;c., and began to take portions of surveys in some, viz., 12 villages, but the Patels came to me, and promising to pay me certain sums in excess, induced me to stop my operations. I did not consider that I was accepting a bribe from these Patels in doing this. I did not realize anything from my Vahivat that year. I had not been in possession more than 10 months, when the Sarkar sent a Karkun, Baburao Krishna, to dispossess me. I do not know why. This Karkun forbade the ryots to pay me anything. They obeyed him, and my ' chits ' which the Patels gave me to stop the survey are useless to me, as they won t pay them. I came to Baroda and complained to the Nana Sahib, and requested him to return my ' Sukdi' or to help me to realize my chits. .A. month before this Nana Sahib had taken Rs. 1,000 ' Sukdi' more in advance from me, and because I had not paid the second Rs. 1,000 in advance, he sent the Karkun to relieve me. Nana Sahib promised to put this Karkun away, but he never did so, and I cannot realize my money. I have two or three times made written petitions to the Maharaj on this subject, but have had no answer from him. The Durbar Agents reserve cross-examination. Reply of the Durbar. The ' Sukdi' was received in the Jamdarkhana, and not by the Dewan. The Karkun who was sent to take charge of the Mahal, was sent in conse quence of complainant having embezzled Rs. 16,000 of public money. We deny the second payment of Rs. 1,000 Sukdi altogether. Final Statement by the Resident. The Commission will not fail to observe that not a single question was put to this witness in cross-examination, and that under these circumstances the meie statements of the Durbar are entitled to little or no weight. If the complainant in—10had embezzled Rs. 16,000 of public money, lie miglit have been convicted and sen tenced according to law. As no proceedings whatever were taken against him, the inference is obvious, that no crime was committed at all. The Resident begs respectfully to represent that the present case was brought forward, not so much for the sake of procuring the petitioner individual redress, as of illustrating a system which has done more to demoralize the revenue admin istration than anything else. The farming system is, under any circumstances, the worst that could be devised for the happiness of the agricultural population; but when the farmers themselves hold their farms on the most precarious tenure, the collection of the revenue becomes a mere scramble amongst the officials, each one doing his best to collect the largest amount of revenue during his tenure of office.SCHEDULE III. C ase N o . 13. Valli Tar, Memon, 28 years, Vakil, resident in Amreli Mahal, of Kattywar, states:—I am Vakil on behalf of the Thakors of Manpur. About 8 months a^o, I made a petition to the Resident in their case, who referred me to Colonel Walker at Amreli. I proceeded thither, and stated my case to him. The case went on there for H or 2 months, when I returned to Baroda. I used to go to the Resi dent daily. Some 10 or 12 days after my return, Appa Sahib called me to the Foujdari, where Balvantrao Eshvant asked me if it were true that I had made petitions to the Resident, and that I was in the habit of seeing him daily. I ad mitted both points, and was thereupon sent by him to the Court of Balvantrao Dev and Narayenbhai, before whom the same questions and answers were asked and given. Balvantrao sentenced me to 10 years' imprisonment, informino- me at the time that it was for making petitions to the Resident. I was sent to the Foujdari, and all my daftar and papers were seized. I remained 15 days in the Foujdari, and was then released by the order of the Resident, to whom one of my men had made a petition. I received my daftar, &amp;c., on release, and signed a receipt for them, but found on enquiry and search into them, that powers of attorney, letters, and other papers were missing. Since about five months ago, I have lived within camp limits at Baroda. The Durbar Agents reserve cross-examination and statement. The Foujdar Balvantrao Eshvant is present, and states that the complainant was brought before him, charged with making improper petitions against the Maharaj, and that after enquiry, he sent the case up for disposal to the Court of Narayenbhai and Balvantrao Dev. Reply of the Durbar. On the information of Mansukh Garwar, to the effect that Valli Tar had preferred a complaint falsely calumniating the Durbar and officers, and that the draft of it would, if his house were searched, be found, the Police were directed to make the necessary search. They accordingly seized all the papers they could find, and brought them and Valli Tar up. He was kept under surveillance, and his papers were ex amined and enquiry made. In the meantime, the Resident interfered, and re commended his release. He was accordingly discharged, and his papers were returned to him. Balvantrao Dev, Narayen Bhai, and Foujdari Officers conducted the enquiry. Complainant's assertion of being threatened with 10 years' imprisonment is false. As to the allegation of his papers being detained, they shall be, if he describes them, looked for and returned if forthcoming. Final Statement of the Resident. There can be no doubt that the petitioner in this case has been grossly ill- treated by the Durbar officials for making representations to the Resident. Not a single question was put to the petitioner in cross-examination, and his com plaint may be accepted as substantially true. This case, as also that of the Naosari petitioners and that of Syad Sadak Ali, show that organized attempts have been made by the Durbar to deter petitioners from coming forward, to terrify those who have already complained. m—13/ 't h 3 . SCHEDULE III. C ase N o . 14. Dalpat Premabhai, Brahman, 35 years, Jamindar of Morthan, Olpad Taluka, Surat District, states:—In the montlx I, in company with two other men, Sankar Lalaji and Daji Pandnrang, entered into a written agreement with the Gaekwar's Grovernment to take the Vahivat of the Yasravi and Gall a Mahals of the Naosari prant for 5 years. We were to pay Rs. 10,000 during the first year in excess of what previous Yahivatdars had done, by raising the revenue in a more careful way, and looking more closely after cultivation. The Yahivat was to be continued to us for 5 years, and it was distinctly so stated in the written agreement. It was not stated, so far as I can remember, how much re venue in excess of previous years we were to raise during the second and sub sequent years of our tenure. In addition to this I agreed to give a nazarana of Rs. 5,425 to Nana Sahib, the minister of the Graekwar, while my two partners were to furnish the security required by Government for our carrying on the work properly. We were in joint management of the Mahals for 1| months, and my partners not having furnished the security, we were then deprived of it, and it was handed over to another person. I paid the nazarana in two sums to Nana Sahib through my cousin Shivram Yalabh, the first sum of Rs. 2,000 being paid at Naosari, and the second of Rs. 3,425 at Baroda. Shivram informed me he had paid them, but produced no receipt from the minister. I was not present when the money was paid. All that I want now is, as I have been turned out, to get back my nazarana of Rs. 5,425. I have never asked Nana Sahib to give me the money back, and the only effort I have made for its restoration is my petition to Mr. Hope, the Collector of Surat, which was sent to the Resident here. I misunderstood the question above put to me about asking for the nazarana back from Nana Sahib, and I now state that previous to the petition being made, I did go to Baroda and ask Nana Sahib to give me the money back again. I understood the question to be whether I had made any effort to get it back since making the petition. The Durbar. Agents decline to cross-examine, and state that in consequence of communications, both verbal and written, between the Maharaj and the Resident, the complainant was repeatedly summoned, through the Resident, to appear before H. H. the Gaekwar with the proofs of his complaint, but that in consequence of his failing to do so, his case has not been enquired into. Shankar Lalaji, Brahman, 47 years, Yahivatdar, resident of Dhoral Pardi, in Naosari Prant, states;—In — t: 1 1 ® 2 1 3 , I took the farm of the Mahals of Galla and Yas- ravi in Naosari, in company with Dalpat Premabhai and Daji Pandurang, but i know nothing of the details of the agreement or nazarana. My cousin and sub- sharer, Dallo Khushal, can state fully all about the matter. The Durbar Agents have no remarks to offer. Dallo Khushal, Brahman, 39 years, Yahivatdar, resident in Dhoral Pardi, Naosari, states : — Shankar Lala is my cousin. In partnership with him and others I took the farm of the Vahivat of Vasravi and Ghalla for ^ in 1871. I paid, to secure the Yahivat, a nazarana of Rs. 6,500 to Nana Sahib, in three sums, Rs. 2,000 in Naosari, and two sums of Rs. 3,425 and 1,075^1 Baroda. The farm remained with us for 1 ^ months, when it was taken from us through adawat (enmity). I came to Baroda to ask for my nazarana back, and Nana Sahib im prisoned me for 1 day and 1 night, when 1 was released on security and told to go to Naosari. in—142 Cross -examinedhy Gaehwar 's Agents.—It was stated in the agreement that securities were to be furnished within one month from the date thereof, and I offered them accordingly, but the Government would not take them. I made no complaint to the Maharaj in this matter. No one would admit me to the presence of the Maharaj, and when I complained to Nana Sahib, he put me m jail. The Durbar offers the same remarks as in Dalpat Prema's case, with the addition that the reason for imprisoning him was that there was a deficiency in his accounts which he had embezzled, and this he was asked to make good. Final Statement by the Eesident. Dalpat Premabhai, Shankar Lalaji, and Dallo Khushal appeared before the Commission on the 10th December, when their evidence was taken, to the effect that they altogether paid to the Minister, Nana Sahib Khanvelkar, the sum of Rs. 11 as nazarana for the privilege of farming the Yasravi and Galla Mahals^ of the Naosari District for 5 years, but that they nad been deprived of theii farm within 1| months, and consequently prayed that their money might be returned. 2. I merely brought forward this case, with others, to prove that the minis ter has been in the habit of selling Vahivatdar s appointments, and had^ the Commission considered it necessary to go fully into the case, as recorded m a primd facie form before the Resident, complete proofs of the nature and details of the transaction would have been afforded. 3. Dalpat Prema was an unwilling witness. On the 18th August he endea voured to draw back from his original complaint made before Mr. Hope, and it will be remembered that before the Commission he at first declared he had asked the minister. Nana Sahib, to return his money, but that on my producing his original petition, in which he clearly stated that gone to the minister to ask for the money back and was threatened with imprisonment for so doing, he o-ot out of the dilemma by saying that he understood the question to refer to a period subsequent to the date of his first petition of June last. This, however, can scarcely be true, as he used the word ' never.' 4. His partners, who are Baroda subjects, have not been tampered with, and are ready to prove their case whenever they may be called upon to do so. 5. Referring to the Durbar's remark that Dalpat Prema had not been sent up to them by me for examination, the reason for not doing so will be found in para. 4 of my letter to Govt. No. Ih dated 18th September, copy of which was forwarded to the Commission with my memo. No. 1083, dated 4th instant, in which I brought to notice the impossibility of subordinates sitting in judgment upon the acts of a superior, that superior being the Minister of the State, in full possession of his ministerial duties. 6. The specimen cases of bribery and corruption in the Petlad District, as set forth in my letter of 16th September last, to the address of H. H. the Gaekwar, which accompanied the letter to Government above quoted, would, if called for by the Commission, have afforded further valuable proof of the extensive scale upon which local subordinates, from the Vahivatdar down, are obliged to extort money in various ways in order to reimburse themselves for their heavy payments to the minister and other Durbar officials. 7. Complaints therefore against the system of nazarana and sale of offices are justly universal throughout the Gaekwar's dominions. The Vahivatdar of a mahal is not simply a farmer of land revenue, but is^ the and judicial authority of the District. There is in each District a Foujdar and a Munsiff, but their functions are confined to the preparation of cases for decision by the Vahivatdar, and thus the office of Vahivatdar acquires an importance which is unknown in our Districts. In fact, the entire authority of Government on the spot in the Revenue, Civil, and Criminal Departments is centred in him.3 The pay of the appointment is generally small, and when we take into considera tion the fact that large sums are offered to obtain these posts, that every other office of importance is sold to the highest bidder, and that bribery and corruption prevail in all quarters, it is hardly to be wondered at that people are oppressed, that justice is sold, life and property is insecure, and, in short, that the whole machinery of Grovernment is obliged to have recourse to unlawful means to extort money from the people. 8. The remarks in the two preceding paras, apply to the whole group of bribery cases as exhibiting their effects upon both the Revenue, Police and Judi cial administrations, in all of which violence is resorted to, to extort confessions and agreements, as well as money.DESTRUCTION OF CROPS BY DEER. With reference to the destruction of crops by deer preserved for His Highness the Gaekwar's sport, certain cultivators have come before the Com- missioneis, and made statements about their losses, which the Commissioners have heard in the presence of the Durbar Agents, who make the following statement as to what they have done to mitigate the evil complained of. The Resident first represented that the Ryots complained of the injury to their crops, and recommended that the keepers should be removed from the villages. The Ryots of 4 villages made a petition to the effect that if the ' Chokis' (establishment of keepers) were removed from 2 villages, Gamri and Mahamadpur, they would not obstruct or injure the deer. The keepers were removed thence. The villagers have since kept 5 men of their own to drive the deer away from their fields. In accordance with the Resident's advice we are willing to allow all villages to keep men to drive away the deer, and to remove our establishment of keepers. All that we can do to alleviate the evil, we are willing to do.Report of Baroda Commission. APPENDIX H.Report of Baroda Commissi oil APPENDIX PAKT II.No. 4171 of 1873. F rom To J. B.

I have, &amp;c., (Signed) J. .B PEILE, Acting Political Agent. Kattywar , Political Agent s Office, Cojinp Dussada, 13th December 1873.-1 MEMORANDUM for reconstitution of Gaekwars gent in Matty war. The two leading facts about the Gaekwar's Contingent in Katty war present this contrast, that whereas His Highness pays, (and pays regularly), nearly a sufficient sum for efficiency, the Contingent is totally useless as a Military Police. There is therefore no need for any large increase of recurring expenditure, though a large sum will be needed to make up defects at starting. There are two great causes of inefficiency in the Contingent:—(1), its want of subordination to the Officers it serves with; (2), its bad organization and equip ment. First, as to Subordination.—The Contingent is commanded by a Gaekwari Subah, and superintended by an Officer, who is also Assistant to the Resident of Baroda, and has jurisdictional duties in His Highness the Gaekwar's Amreli Mahals. The Head Quarters of the Contingent are at Manekwara, (not far from Junaghad), in Eattywar, but the Superintendent as a fact lives at Amreli. The Subah, (so Government has ruled), must continue to command. But it Command and Snperintendence. j S . ^ g 0 « d to i ^ . an 0fficer ' ^ho takes his orders from Baroda, and is not one of the Kat- tywar Staff, to superintend or watch the Contingent, on behalf of those who have to rely on it, viz., the Political Agent and his Officers. And the Head Quarters of the mounted Police should be at the Head Quarters of the Agency at Rajkot. Government assumes that the New Special Officer of Police will command the renovated Contingent in Katty war. He will certainly use them, but as he will probably not be posted at Rajkot, and as he will be much on the move, I suggest this alteration as preferable :—The Superintendent of the Gaekwar's Con tingent in Katty war should be the personal Assistant of the Political Agent, who should be a Military Officer, and should also hold the office of Station Magistrate, Rajkot. I would also stipulate, if the Subah is to be Commanding Officer, that he should be invested with full powers under the observation of the Political Agent and Superintendent, and not checked and trammelled by spying karkuns and independent Silledars in the manner exposed in the papers appended. The Superintendent should conduct the business of the force at Depot Head Quarters, and the Prant Political Officers should Distribution. communicate with him as the officer in charge of this duty. I would then have— Depdt Head-Quarters Rajkot Prant Head-Quarters— Jhalawar W adwan Gohelwar Songhad Sorath Manekwara Hallar Rajkot. The Contingent should be divided into five troops, each complete with its Formation officers. One to be at the Depot, and one in each Prant.Each! troop to number (men and Officers) 120, or six hundred men in all. The Special Officer of Police should have besides 20 men and 5 officers. The Depot troop to be maintained for relief purposes, and be kept at special drill. It will also furnish the Political Agent's escort. r , , The Prant troops to be at the orders of the on r0 ' four Political Officers, each in his Prant. The Assistant Political Agent will (subject to the Political Agent) decide where the men are to be posted and how employed in his Prant. He will also closely supervise their pay, discipline, drill, cleanliness, arms, ammunition, clothing, and communicate on these subjects with the Superintendent at Eajkot, who will have everything claimable under the treaty, or rules in force, promptly supplied, but duly consulting the Subah. A code of rules to be issued to decide what minor offences the Political m . , f r,. Officer of the Prant may punish summarily and what na o o e ces. w ill be tried by the Subah. In any of the latter ( serious) cases, the Political Officer to be authorized to arrest the Sowar and send him in custody to Rajkot. All non-military offences to be tried by the Criminal Courts of the Agency. The Prant Political Officer to have a right to object to any of the horses he 0 tine horses thinks unserviceable, which must be cast and replaced if the Superintendent concurs with the Prant Officer. If they differ, the Political Agent to decide. No hereditary claims to serve as Sowars can be allowed, and the men c , emust all be of military age, not old men or boys Selection of men. m_ o • as some ot the present Sowars are. i he Superin tendent if supported by the Political Agent to have the right to insist on any man being discharged as inefficient, and to refuse to pass any new man enlisted. The pay of all ranks to be disbursed regularly through the Rajkot and Prant Disbursement of pay. Treasuries. If funds are not otherwise provided, the disbursements to be debited against the Gaek- war's Tribute. Each troop to consist of 100 privates and 20 Officers. The full complement Constitntion of Troops. named in tlie may be somewhat modified, P but a large number of Subordinate Officers is 4 Dafedars needed, because the troops will be split into many 8 Naiks. small parties on duty at the Thanas. The Officer 1 Farrier. of the Depot troop should have somewhat higher 1 Writer^ P a y as I^ asa ldar Major, &amp;c. These officers or a large part of them to be trained soldiers. The whole force to be mounted on mares or geldings, (which do not scream Horses. when strange horses are approached), and to be one horse Silledars, finding their own horses. Suitable horses can be obtained in Kattywar for from 150 to 200 rupees. Uniform to be left for decision. But that of the Reformed Horse would do. Uniform. One part of it should be a horseman's cloak for night patrols. The men to be trained to act either on horse or foot. To be armed with ^ rms carbines and good native swords. Officers to have double-barrelled breach-loading pistols (Adam's). The carbines to be of some pattern, (Enfibld's), used by British Cavalry, so that supplies of them and of ammunition can always easily got. The double- barrelled carbine of the Siad Horse is said to be a good wjapon, but is probably difficult to get. 1 Rasaldar. 1 Rasaidar, 1 Naib Rasaldar. 1 Jemadar. 1 Kot Dafedar.3 A Dep6t of ball and blank cartridge to be kept at each Prant Head Quarters, Ammunition. aild a lar g er stock at the Depot Head Quarters'. The men to be exercised in firing blank and ball in the Prants, as opportunity offers, and at Rajkot regularly. Ammunition to be obtained on payment from the Government arbenal, and debited to the Gaekwar. Pay. The Sowars to receive Rs. 30 per mensem, and the Officers the rates of the British Cavalry. No Bargirs to be allowed. Leave Rules to be those in the British service. Special rules or other matters T j .-I i of detail to be adopted from those for the Sind Leave ..d oth,- rule., Horse Fu J ^ ^ to be made according to the rules of the Sind Horse. In proposing a total force of 625 men I have not provided for His Highness the Gaekwar's Mahals in Kattywar. Nor will any of these 625 be available for m'sjeUaneous escorts, e. g., of Survey parties, Educational Inspector, Vaccinators, Infanticide censors, &amp;c. For these perhaps a lighter class of Sowar with sword only and on lower pay should be employed. The whole number of the Contingent is 900 and probably should be 1,000, considering the size Of Kattywar; so I have left a margin of either 275 or 375 Sowars for the above purposes. (Signed) J. B. PEILE, Acting Political Agent. Kattywar, Political Agent's Office, Camp Dassara, December 13^, 1873.1 / Rules for the guidance of the Officers and K Horse of His Highness the Gaekwar, according to Treaty. 1. A body of the Contingent to be stationed at each of the principal stations or cantonments, which shall be divided into Companies of 100 men each, com posed as under :— 1 Subedar. 4 Jemadars! 1 Havildar Major. 4 Havildars. 4 Naiques. 4 Sub (or Lance) Naiques. 1 Standard bearer. 1 Nugarjee. 1 Nowbuttee. 1 Trumpeter. 78 Sowars. 100 Total. 1. The muster of the Sowars to be taken twice a day by the Havildar Major. Any absentee to forfeit his day's pay unless he can shew satisfactory reasons to the Commanding Officer for his absence. 2. Any Sowar of whom it is certified by the Medical Officer that he is unable by reason of sickness to attend muster, may be granted leave by the Commanding Officer, and will be placed under medical treatment. 3. A general muster of the Sowars is to take place every month, and any horse found ' unfit' for service will be struck off the rolls. If, however, any horse is in such condition that though not absolutely unfit, it is capable of improve ment, it is to be placed on a ' sick roll' and looked after, after which if it does not improve, orders shall be issued for its being replaced within the space of two months, its substitute being entered on the muster roll. Strict orders should be given that the unfit horse is not to be used anywhere within the limits of the 'Lushkur' so as to prevent the possibility of its ever coming again on the strength of the Corps. 4. A Silledar, in the event of his horse dying, will be allowed two months' time to replace it, and the new horse is to be duly entered on the muster roll. 1. The pay of the Bargeer Sowars stationed in Kattywar is fixed at eight rupees, as long as the dearth continues. The Sowars stationed in the. other Mahals will receive seven rupees at least each. 2. The Pagadars and Silledars are to pay the Bargeer Sowars under them in the presence of the Soobha or his Kamdars. 3. The officers in charge of detachments on duty at the different Thannas will pay the Sowars and take their receipts within 15 days after the issue of pay at Head Quarters. I.—F oemation. ii.— M uster. Ill —P ay.-2 . , i . IV.—D ress , D iscipline, &amp;c. 1 It is the duty of the Officer who may be in charge of a Company to see that the Sowars take proper care of their dress, accoutrements, &amp;c. The Soobha or his Kamdar should also make personally an inspection of the same every month. 2. 'When practicable, two Companies of horse, (the tours being taken by the different Companies in succession), should be stationed at Head Quarters with a View to efficiency and fitness for service being kept up. 3 The supply for each horse will be eight seers of grain and 15 seers (weight) grass. 4 A Sowar despatched on emergent duty from one principal station to another must return without delay after discharging such duty. With a view to prevent any evasion of this rule, the Kamdar of the station to, which he is sent, is to give him a certificate showing the date on which he was directed to return, which must be produced before the Commanding Officer on rejoining. V.—E scort op P risoners. 1. Prisoners guilty of heinous offences, should, on removal from one place to another, be sent in carts, with their hands and feet chained. Prisoners giiilty of minor offences need only have their hands chained, their arms being tied with a rope or cord and thus secured ; one or two may be conducted by one guard, ■ihe villagers are to provide a proper watch (in conjunction with the escort) and accommodation, as mentioned in an enclosure to Durbar Yad No. 643 oi 1864 in reply to the Residency Yad No. 179 of the same year. If a prisoner is to be sent a greater distance than 6 koss, an escort of not less than a Sub-JNaiques party must be furnished together with a perwana from the British authority. 2 A prisoner when being conveyed from a halting place must be attend ed as specified in the 1st section. 3. A prisoner requiring to perform the calls of nature on the march, shall be properly escorted and carefully guarded. 4. At halting places, a prisoner pressed by the calls of nature in the night time shall be taken out, with a rope tied to his arm, by a watchman or sowar, notice being given. VI. — D uty. 1. The Sowars should be ready for service whenever ordered by the British Officer, and should be told explicitly by their superior officers the nature and pro bable duration of the duty to be performed. 2. A Sowar entrusted with delivery of post or any important despatch should execute his commission promptly and without negligence, in failure ot which he should receive a commensurate punishment. 3. The following is laid down as the strength of the different parties of Sowars:— Sub-Naique's party ... ... from 4 to 8 Sowars. Naique's do. ... ... from 8 to 16 Sowars. Havildar's do. ... ... up to 20 ditto. . . . .. , Jemadar's do. ... ... up to 25 ditto with full comple ment of Non -Commissioned Omcers, 4. When any duty is to be performed, the Kamdar must give notice to the Soobedar and it will be the duty of the Havildar Major to warn the feowars. Should, however, no officers be present with the party, one of the Sowars mus perform the duty ordered. 5. All duties ordered by the British Officers shall be carried out by the Sowars in turn according to roster. 6. The Officer Commanding or in charge of a Company must keep a roster book and conduct the duty agreeably to the above rule.3 7. The Sowars are to obey the orders of the officer under whom they may be detailed for service in the same manner as those of the Soobedar. 8. Any Sowar disobeying this rule is to be reported to the Soobedar, and the case shall be inquired into and dealt with under the orders of the Soobha. VII.—E scort of T reasure. 1. For the protection of treasure an escort should be sent according to the orders of the British Officer. But it shall be at the discretion of the Kamdar of the Gaekwar's Government (consulting that Officer on the same) to send a larger party than that ordered. 2. At halting places the treasure should be kept in a spot to be pointed out by the Patel of the village, and the Sowars in charge should use all vigilance in conjunction with the authorities of the village, who will provide a suitable watch for the said treasure. An order or pass to the effect the villages are to provide proper watch and accommodation for the party in charge, should be rarnished by the British authority. VIII.—L eave. 1. Any Sowar will be granted leave on a certificate being given by the Medical Officer. 2. If a Sowar on Thanna or detachment duty fail sick, he may return to his Head Quarters on receiving the permission of his Commanding Officer, who will commmunicate with the Thanadar or Mehta on the subject. 3. If a Sowar be refused such permission, he may report it to the Soobedar of his Company, who will, if proper, bring it to the notice of the Soobha and replace him by another Sowar. 4. A Sowar going on sick leave without his horse will be given at most one week's grace after the expiry of his leave, after which time if not present his place will be filled up. 5. All men are to rejoin within the term of their leave, and if an extension is required, application must be made for its sanction before the expiry of such leave. 6. Every Sowar going on leave must procure a certificate from the Soobha shewing the date up to which he has permission to be absent and whether he has provided a substitute or not. 7. A Sowar may be granted leave for one month without substitute by tlie Soobha, if he has completed one year's uninterrupted service. If he require a longer period, his application must be submitted for the orders of the Senaputty. IX.—O ffences. 1. If any one connected with the Contingent of Horse infringe any of the above rules or fail in his duty, the Soobha or his Kamdar is empowered to innict a fine on such person to the extent of three months' pay, or simple imprison ment up to three months. If, however, the offence is considered deserving of severer punishment than it is in the power of the Soobha to award, the case may be submitted for the decision of the Senaputty. 2. The Soobha must prepare and submit, as soon after the 1st of each month as possible, a defaulter roll containing an abstract of the offences committed an the punishments awarded. &lt;&lt; ; 3. The Soobha, if he deem it proper, may suspend a Sowar or Umuldar, reporting the matter for the consideration of the Senaputty. , • ; ; x i4. The Soobha or his Kamdar on awarding punishment of imprisonment shall direct the Karkhanedar, to whom the offender is amenable, to carry out the sentence. 5. The Soobha or his Kamdar may release an offender on bail if such a course is not deemed objectionable. X. — C ontracts. 1. No one serving in the Contingent is to be allowed to take up or give contracts for the horses or Karkhana. XI. — R eliefs. 1. The reliefs of the Sowars on duty at the different Thannas must be car ried out once a year, but the Soobha may at his discretion order them oftener, reporting his having done so for the information of the Senaputty. 2. The reliefs as above-mentioned should always be made by the Soobha in conjunction with the Officer in immediate command of the whole body of the Contingent serving in the Mahal and never without. 3. The Officer in command or charge of each Company must superintend the muster of his, Company morning and evening and report accordingly to the Soobha.1 No. 68 or 1873. F kom C olonel C. W. WALKER, Superintendent, His Highness the Gaekwar's Contingent, Kattywar. To T he ACTING POLITICAL AGENT, Kattywar. 30 th 1873. S ir, I have the honor to forward for the information of the Baroda Commission, as requested in your letter No. 4030 of 24th ultimo, a statement of His Highness the Gaekwar's Contingent in this Province. 2. Also a copy of the Distribution return of the Force made up to December? marked B, 3. The condition of men is in a large proportion fair. There are some elderly Silledars. These are usually put on easy duties chiefly at Head quarters. They are old servants, and not having sons, or near relations to put in, who would provide for their maintenance, and being still able to carry on light work, look ing after grain, grass, accompanying Government stallions, &amp;c., have been allow ed to remain. Their number is being gradually reduced, and Bargirs are substi tuted, when such an arrangement can be made without much hardship to old servants of the State- 4. The condition of the horses is variable and is good or bad according to the amount of work given them, and depends much on the season of the year, whether fodder is good or bad, the season healthy or otherwise at the station where employed. As a general rule the horses are much overworked, and, being distributed in numerous small out-posts, cannot be well looked after by the officers of the Force. Considering all things I may say the horses are in fair condition, and in many instances, when an intelligent interest in the animal is naturally taken by officers under whom they are^ employed, I find the horses in good condition, owing, I believe, to their not being harassed by long, rapid and often unnecessary marches, carrying dawks, &amp;c., in the hot weather where the Government Post is available. 5. As my Annual Report for 1871, to the Resident, contained my sentiments then, and conveys those I still hold on the Contingent, I beg to attach extiact paragraphs 9 to 24 from that document. Copy of paragraphs 17 to 22 was sent to the Political Agent by the Acting Resident, with his letter iSo. 1077 of Is November 1872, but as I am not aware of any thing further having been done in the matter, a reference to the table B will show the way m which the men are now employed. 6. I beg to state distinctly that in my opinion we have only ourselves to blame for any fault which may be found with the Contingent. Except m the way of dressing the men, I have always found the Durbar ready to assist m keeping up the efficiency of the Force. Overwork not only tells on the horses, but breaks the spirits of the men.7. I have asked for increased pay to enable the men to feed their horses better and in some way enable them to perform their far too heavy duties, but if work were reduced, the horses could be kept in good order even on the present pay of the men, and admit of the Silledar supporting himself and family. I do not th ink any of the Durbars in this province give more than Es. 25 to their Sowars. Some of them give less, and the men of this Force receive monthly Rs. 29 Babasai, equal now to Rs. 25 of British currency. 8. The Agency Mohsali Sowars called Kala-Dagla-wallas are paid Rs. 30, but they are a small body of men and paid from the Mohsali funds. 9. Of course in these expensive days I should be glad to see the Contingent better' paid, but I do not think the measure absolutely necessary; a Silledar can now feed his horse with, daily, 8 lbs. of Bajri, the only suitable grain to he had in many parts of the country, and 1,000 bundles of grass monthly, for about Rs. 11 per mensem. His horse may require a little ' Gur,' and his horse-kit may cost a small sum in repairs, in all about a rupee a month, leaving him, if he rides the horse himself, Ss. 13, or, if he finds a Bargir, at Rs. 8, Babasai, Rs. 6-12-0, Butish currency, per mensem about Rs. 6-4-0. It must, however, be taken into considera tion that in some of our Districts grass is more expensive than in others, and the owner of a horse dying or becoming unfit for service has to replace it. This measure is made lighter by the owner subscribing monthly to a fund which assists him and keeps him out of the Shroff's hands. He is also allowed 2 months in which to provide a fresh horse, the pay of the period going to help him in the purchase. 10. The rates of pay are shown in the detailed Statement (marked A). 11. Pay is most regularly disbursed by the Subha monthly, a large sum always remaining for this purpose in the Manikwara Treasury, supplied from the Amreli Mahals. 12. I beg to point out that the Contingent is divided into 9 companies and that the ofiicers and non-commissioned officers are proportionately distributed in their companies. These have been given rank, but without increased pay. 13. In conclusion I take the opportunity to state that I have always re ceived the greatest attention to my representations connected with the discipline of the Force, from the Durbar, and His Highness the Gaekwar's present Subha, Gajajirao Khanvelkar, and his Dewan, Kasipant. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., (Signed) C. W. WALKER, Superintendent, His Highness the Gaekwar's Contingent, Kattywar.EXTRACT from the Annual Report of 1 intendent of His Highness the Gaekwa Kattywar, address of the Resident atBaroda. Para. 9. The men are, as you are aware, paid in. the Babasai Rupee, the value of which is now greatly depreciated. At the present rate of exchange, were a Silledar in receipt of Rs. 30 as supposed by you, this figure would only represent Bs. 24-6-0 of our money, a sum from which it is almost impossible for a Silledar to keep himself, family, and horse in any part of this Province. 10. I observe that this is one of the subjects treated by Lieutenant-Colonel Parr in his Annual Report during my absence in England. 11 The present pay of the Contingent taken in connection with the duties now required of the Force, is the difficulty against which we have to contend. On this latter subject I shall enlarge further on. 12. In Kattywar, as you are aware, from local experience, there are enor mous numbers of horsemen in the employ of all the States. In a few, sma numbers are dressed in uniform, but the vast majority are, hke this Contingent, ex cepting the troop of Reformed Horse, allowed to dress as they like. 1 think it would be very advantageous if His Highness' Contingent could be m some way distinctively marked by a cheap uniform. The men ^ would be led to have moie re spect for their position as Sowars of the ' Maharaja, and would be more respected in the Province. A pagri and kammarband of an uncommon and therefoie tinctive colour would, I think, be sufficient, with white angarkha and draweis. This would not cost His Highness anything as the men mustwe^pagns &amp;c and they can as easily have them of a uniform colour as . n ^ , ^ ^ entailing no extra cost on His Highness, might also be issued directing the Silledars when providing horse equipments, such as ''Ghashia, Jerban , bridle, to have them of a uniform colour to match the Tagn. , , • i 13. The troop of Reformed Horse is at PJ esen t wel J ^ eauinned in every way. The men are not ' picked men, as I think they might be with some management by the Durbar, and the ^ JXI foHm^vbg as fine as they should be. On vacancies occurring advan ^^ ta ^ ^ ^ P d i fficu ft the latter, as all horses must be passed by the Superintendent, but it is ditticult to interfere with the former. 14 The exigencies of the service have interfered greatly with the drill, &amp;c., of this troop S^maTof them are always absent from Head Quarto, and sta tioned ahou^' the eountry in small detachments it h^ bee ° ^PreolMefing dl absolutely necessary attention to this subject, the m ™' j) a j u things, are very handy, and go through a parade very alt ' } - . UK j deserving Patel, and Jeiiedar, Sultan Khan, are attentive and zealous officers, and deserving of commendation. , , , i- TT . j 15. All the outposts, with the exception of Dwarka, ave een ^ ^ during the year. These reliefs are mostly merely tran f^- la ^ e men t P 0 escort to another, as there are seldom, now -a-days, any nearly all Pay from Head Quarters, the men remaining Karkuns, Standard -bearers, Drummers, &amp;c., &amp;c., not such 16. The Contingent, as you are a w ar ^ c o nsists of Head deducting th \ non - eff % t ; V ^ a 8 r ^^ autV Of this number 707 are constantly Quarters, we have really only oo^ tor amy. in the Monsoon, on outpost or escort. Of the latter a few go to Zttot but as their duty is usually the heaviest, carrying a , .,2 weather, their horses require the whole wet season to recover condition. Further must be deducted from this number 832 for duty, a fair proportion of men on leave and sick, or with sick horses requiring rest from duty, so that we are re duced to 800 men. Again to be deducted from these we have men whose horses have died, and who are allowed two months in which to replace them, an average of 5, giving an actual total for service of 795 as shewn below ;— Total of Contingent 900 Deduct— Non-effectives at Head Quarters 68 Men on leave, 3 per cent 27 Horses sick — 5 Horses died ' — 6 105 Grand total for duty 795 The duties may be stated as Outpost and Escort 707 Carrying Pay to Outposts 25 Relieving Sick, &amp;c 25 At Head Quarters 143 Total.... 900 Deducting the 68 'Non-effectives' from 143 'remaining at Head Quar ters,' there are really but 75 left to meet sudden calls. 17. It appears to me absolutely necessary that either the work of the Con tingent should be reduced, or its strength increased. On the first point I have applied to you for the return to this Province of the 30 Sowars lent in time of emergency to Okhamandal. If it is necessary to have an increased strength of Sowars in that District, which is under separate Durbar management, I am of opinion the men should be supplied direct from Baroda. I have also, on more than one occasion, requested the Political Agent to endeavour to dispense with some of the numerous outposts now supplied by the Force, but all I have suc ceeded is to get, up to the end of December last, the outposts and escorts down to 707 men. 18. I beg to append a list showing 176 men of this Contingent who are now employed on duties which should, I consider, be paid for by Talukdars. 19. In this Province if a small Talukdar is unable or unwilling to properly conduct his duties, one or more Thanadars as necessary are appointed by the Political Agent, with the requisite Police Patawalas, &amp;c., to form a Thana. Office, Jails, and Lines for the Police and Peons are built and all expenses paid by the Talukdar. To complete the Thana, however, it is found necessary to employ Howars, and the easiest mode of obtaining these is to draw on this Contingent. A party is supplied, but not paid for by the Talukdar, as all the other officials are, and if Horse Lines are wanted. His Highness the Gaekwar is called upon to build and pay for them. Why the Agency should not furnish Sowars as well as Thanadars, Police, &amp;c., at the cost of the Talukdar, I am unable at present to see. 20. There are 155 of the Contingent employed as above-mentioned, their duties being those of escorting prisoners belonging to the Taluka, and carrying postal or other correspondence, the pay of the members of the Thana, and accom panying the Thanadar whenever he goes out of his Thana. I am of opinion that all these duties might be performed by Sowars chosen from a civil body of men.3 at any time easily increased called the ' Kala-Dagla-walas,' now in the employ of the Agency, and who would be paid by the Talukdar as all the rest of the persons composing the Thana. 21. To complete the 176 men referred to in my 18th para., I beg to point to 21 men attached as escorts to officers employed in boundary settlements. All these officers and their estabhshments are paid by the Talukdars, whose boun daries are in process of being settled. I cannot understand what difficulty there would be m supplying these escorts also from the ' Kala-Dagla-walas' on the terms mentioned m para. 20 of this Eeport. 22. The Contingent of 795 effective men, with 707 on outpost and escort duty, serving under 50 officers, their temporary masters, you will not be surprised to find, is the best abused Force m the Province. For 48 fault-finders there are but two defenders or more properly extenuators. It is my duty to state that I do not tmnk that the consideration which is due to a Force so overworked is invari- ably shewn by officials to the Contingent. I believe a great deal too much is expected of both men and horses, particularly of the latter. Owners of well-fed and carefully tended horses, who think 6 kos a very fair day's work for one of their animals, think 12 kos nothing for a Sowar's horse, and if their post is late forget the latter's horse is not in high condition, and that his owner carrying a heavy bag may very naturally have tried to save him through a long ride at mid-day in the hottest weather. Under emergent circumstances it may be necessary at all risks to send a Sowar a very long distance, and expect that he shall travel fast, butm ordinary times I think much might be done to save the horses. 23. I do not stand up to defend the shortcomings of the Force but I think I am right in expecting that this Contingent should meet with the con sideration, which could not be refused to any of our own Irregular Mounted Corps. 24 If the duties now expected of the Contingent cannot be reduced, as I believe they can, it is obvious that the body must become perfectly disorganized or worn out, unless augmented, and the only source from whence I can smwest relief is from the Mahi Kanta, where perhaps 100 men might be spared for the present. • or (True extract) (Signed) C. W. WALKER, Colonel, Superintendent, His Highness the Gaekwar's Contingent, Kattywar.No. 805 of 1873. From T he ACTING POLITICAL SUPERINTENDENT, Pahlanpur, To T he SECRETARY, BARODA COMMISSION. Jinjuwara, 1873. S ir, In reply to your letter No. 13 of 1873, dated Baroda, November I9tli, 1873, I have the honor to forward herewith the return called for. It is, I regret to say, incomplete, inasmuch as 'the rates of pay assigned to each grade serving in each paga or Government detail' have not been furnished me by the Subha, and I am informed by the Subha's Karkun with my camp, that he has received instructions only to forward this kind of form. I am therefore unable to furnish such portion of the detail required. 2. I do not myself feel entire confidence in the reports I have received that the pay is regularly disbursed, but I must acknowledge that no Sowar complain ed to me at the muster of the Gaekwari Sowars at Deesa on the 14th ultimo regarding the irregularity of the disbursements of pay, nor has any Sowar since then complained to me, although I have visited Tharad, Bhabar, Radhanpur, &amp;c., &amp;c. The District Karkuns also report that the pay is regularly disbursed, al though, as it is paid in Babasai and not in Imperial Rupees, a considerable loss in exchange accrues to the Sowars. 3. I should say myself that the pay is decidedly insufficient, and that it would be a g -eat advantage to all concerned, if the Contingent were paid in Imperial instead of Babasai Rupees. 4. The efficiency of the Contingent Sowars posted in the Pahlanpur Districts is very much superior to that of the Kattywar Contingent with which I am well acquainted. I attribute this difference to the Pahlanpur Contingent being more directly under the Political Superintendent, and the absence of any intermediate officer in charge. I believe the Political Agent, Kattywar, concurs in this opinion, but a reference to him on this subject would doubtless throw light upon the question. 5. Although the Contingent serving in the Pahlanpur Districts is not equal to properly drilled troops, they have nevertheless not been entirely useless, and have captured or killed several outlaws during the current official year. 6. If the Contingent were thoroughly efficient, I consider that 300 good horsemen would be sufficient for these districts, but this estimate does not include whatever number might be required by the Brigadier General Commanding Deesa Field Brigade. Such Sowars should, I conceive, be entirely separate, and have no connection with the 300 District Sowars. 7. But when I say 300 Sowars would be sufficient, I suppose that 150 men of the Dhari Regiment should also be stationed here for employment in the res tricts. In most places horsemen are more useful than foot, but there are also posts where foot would be more valuable than horse. I consider then that 300 really efficient horsemen and 150 footmen would be sufficient to keep order in these Districts.2 8. In conclusion I think that, as at present constituted, 625 horsemen, the actual number employed in these Districts, is not sufficient to keep order, and I may mention that Colonel Phayre, when Acting Political Superintendent here, was obliged to post Sowars of the Pahlanpur levy in the Districts outside the proper limits of the Pahlanpur State. These Sowars I have found it necessary to keep where posted by Colonel Phayre, and as the 625 Sowars are, in my opinion, insufficient, I addressed a letter to the Resident, No. 759 of 1873, dated the 15th ultimo, requesting that the 55 Sowars now stationed at Patan should be sent to the Pahlanpur Districts. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., (Signed) J. WATSON, Acting Political Superintendent.No. 1173 of 1873. F kom C aptain H. N. REEVES, Acting Political Agent, Eewa Kant a, To T. D. MACKENZIE, E squire, Secretary, Baroda Commission, Baroda. Ilewa Kanta Agency, 1873. S ir, In reply to your No. 12, dated 19th instant, I have the honor to append a return giving the information required in the 1st sub-para, of your first Para. 2 As regards the general condition of the men and horses of the Contingent serving in the Rewa Kanta districts, I should say that as a rule the horses were underfed and not properly cared for, though there are ot course many exceptions The Agent has power to cast any undersized or worn-out horses, and _ fresh o have to be supplied by the Pagadar or Silledar who them subject to the approval of the Political Agent, who inspects and passes them before they are borne on the strength of the Contingent. _ 3 Each Sowar is armed with a sword, sometimes with a gun or carbine as well as a sword. I have known instances where Sowars carried a shield and a spear as well as a sword. 4. As these arms are the property of the men themselves, they sell or ex change them at pleasure : thus a man carrying a sword and a gun may dispose the latter and buy a brace of pistols or a spear, according to his iancy. ^ 5 I am of opinion that the Sowars of the Contingent employed m these districts are useless as Police or for Military purposes, as they are wanting two great essentials of a military body—organization and discipline 6. For miscellaneous duties, such as carrying the post from P la ® e ^ P la ^ going to fetch witnesses and others whose presence may be required y Lent Sub-magistrates and Attachment officers stationed tricts, escorting persois of rank and offlcia position and even the ordmary dass of prisoners, (though in some instances they let them es ^f)' amonnte of treasnr? ; they are exceedingly nseful. indeed without I am at a loss to know how the work of this large Agency 7. I regret to say that I am unable to give the Commssion information as to pay and deductions, authorised or f ^^ith t and Bargirs, as the Political Agent has nothing whatever to do with t 8. The Subah of the Contingent, (His Highness' in these matters, and he alone has the power of entertain g g &amp; 1116,1 9. As a notorious fact I know that the ally a Paga is fanned out, that the men's pay is subject d ^ 0 f ^ to swell the incomes of the various Kamdars an ar ^ T , -. ,. am j the or another to every Paga and indeed to every ^ae wan , t bhangi, very grain of the horses has to pay toll m shape of 'Muthi, (handfu , to bnang , hhisti, and khasdar, (horse-keeper), before it reaches the annnaf s mouth.10. These facts have been wellknown in the Residency since the days of Mr. Sutherland, who was at great pains to enquire into the whole subject and to record the result of his investigations. 11. Nor is the pay of the Sowars regularly disbursed to them—the instances reported m paras. 233, 234, and 235 of my last Annual Report (copy with the Resident); as also see Colonel Barton's last report to the Resident on subject of the Contingent, No. 631, dated 19th June 1872. 12. The enclosed extract from a report on the Police arrangements in the Rewa Kanta districts, which I recently submitted to Government, contains my views on the reorganization of the Contingent serving under this Agency and the Appendix (E), is a distribution return of the Force. ° ' 13. I regret that I am unable to furnish the Commission with a printed copy of this long report, but I would respectfully suggest a requisition being made to Government for one, as I have asked the Political Secretary to print it for the information and guidance of the Officers belonging to this Agency, as well as for transmission f to the various Collectors and Political Officers whose districts ioin mine. J 14. The general idea, however, set forth in the report is that the different Native States and groups of estates should organize and maintain their own 1 ohce forces ; in the case of the semi-independent and larger States, both mounted and foot Police ; but in the case of the latter, called in this Agency Mehwassi estates, only foot Police. 15. That 200 Sowars of the Contingent, (including officers), should be re- orgamzed and thoroughly drilled and disciplined, that a portion of this detachment should be posted in the different Thanas, as mounted constabulary to keep the peace in the surrounding districts, and that, with the exception of a few employed as escorts to the Political Agent, his Special Assistant, and the Superintendent of ederal 1 ohce, so long as the appointment lasts, the rest should be kept together at the Head Quarters ready for any emergency. 16. That the remainder of the Contingent, i .e., 114 men, should be employed as at present on a number of miscellaneous duties, but that the whole body should be under the Superintendence of an European officer. 17. I am decidedly of opinion that in this Agency no reduction in the num- ;) . ei I . ^ ® oowars is feasible, and that, on the contrary, an increase of 100 undis ciplined Sowars is very desirable, if His Highness the Ga^kwar could be persuad ed to give his consent thereto. 18. The Kattywar Agency, which comprises 20,000 square miles of districts m a compact form, has 1,000 Sowars at its disposal, besides a body of Agency Mohsah Sowars. 19 While this Agency, consisting of 12,000 square miles of most scattered districts, has only 314 feowars wherewith to carry on all its multifarious duties. ,. , , 20 ' Tbe Pahlanpur and Mahikanta Agencies, which are smaller and have ^hter work than the Rewa Kanta Agency, have 1,000 horse attached to each ot them. Ihese facts speak for themselves. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) H. N. REEVES, Acting Political Agent./ No. 41 of 1874. F rom M ajor P. H. LEGEYT, Acting Political Agent, Mahikanta, To T he SECRETARY, BARODA COMMISSION. Sadra, 1874. S ir, In accordance with your memo. No. 29, dated the 14th instant, I have the honor to report as follows on His Highness the Gaekwar's Contingent, serving in the Mahikanta, and to furnish a statement showing 1. The number of troops of the Contingent serving in the Mahikanta. 2. The name of each Paga. 3. Strength of each Paga. 4. Whether the Pagadar is present or resides elsewhere. 5. How the Contingent is armed. 6. The amount assigned to each Risala and Paga. 7. When pay is disbursed. 8. How the force is distributed. 2. I am unable at present to furnish information as to the rates ot pay to eaoh grade serving in each paga, but the Baroda Durbar has lean directed by the R 3sident to cause such information to be furnished to me, and wnen it is, I will do myself the honor of communicating the same to you. 3. I have the honor to state that the condition of the men and horses is generally good. 4. The two Risalas of Reformed Horse, whose arms are provided by the Durbar, are fairly armed, but the rest of the Contingent is not so properly accoutred, and this calls for the attention of the Baroda Durbar. 5. The Contingent is efficient for the work on which it is employed. I do not consider the duties could be performed with a smaller number than at present, and would not therefore recommend any reduction. 6. If Government require of His Highness the Gaekwar an efficient fight ing Force, I would distinctly state they have not got what they require, but they have a body of men performing duties of a nature which would try extremely the discipline of a good Cavalry corps. 7. If reform is necessary, it is mainly required in the system of giving of Pagas. These Pagadars accept the pagas with the idea that money is to be made out of the grant, and undoubtedly make it, to the detriment of the service. 8. It would perhaps add to the efficiency of the Force it the number of horses was reduced from 1,000 to 800, and 200 riding camels substituted for the 200 horses thus reduced.2 These Camel Sowars could, in ordinary times, carry despatches &amp;c and accompany detachments sent on sudden service, carrying many things which now cumber the poor horses on a march, and bring in forage from a distance wherp such might be found to be scarce. This, together with a more careful selection of Native Commissioned and Non-Comnussioned Officers and a proper staff of Farriers, would perhaps be all that could be done without the immediate supervision and close daily attention of European Officers.
