Cabih Beg recognised that much of it would be treated at irrelevant snd so,to do him justice, did Ali Xhulqi Beg. But he represented that he was absolutely bound bji his instructions and that he would himself be taken personally to task and held responsible, if he did not say the words that had been put in his mouth.

He thinks it is quite probable that he added that it would be better to concentrate on the future, and regarding the past to let bygones b» bygones (as then was and still is his opinion). at any rate he thinks that the slate should now be held to have been cleaned by ’Uqair.

Agreement haa been met on all points except the *Xraq fifth point, where 'Iraq obstructs a reasonable solution, and the question \ of the return of refugee tribesmen to Ibn Ba'ud on his demand. The difficulty is more in regard to future migrations without license than to those tribes which are already settled in * Iraq. The Najd envoys say that they are absolutely bound by their instructions and that it is quite impossible for them to sign anything unless this point, which is vital to them, is agreedt to, or their instructions are modified. I have placed before them:- va) tine solution put forward in your telegram No. 25 of the 14th January, which the 'Iraq envoy accepts; (b) a suggestion that they record the measure of agreement reached, and a reasoned statement by both sides on the two points where agreement has been found Impossible (c) I have even gone the length of proposing arbitration by His Majesty's Government. They will sign nothing, and are Indeed in a difficult posi tion, for Ibn Sa'ud has drastic methods of dealing with envoys who exceed their instructions. ' Both parties have however signed and submitted to me as President a joint letter, in which they state that as prelimi nary agreement has been reached on all points except the return of refugee tribesmen, and nothing more can usefully be discussed' here unless arid until th«Ir instructions are modiflad, they propose an adjournment of the Conference until 5th March, to enable the envoys to explain the position fully to their principals. 5th March seems too load, 24th February should suffice.

I cannot see any way of removing the present deadlock with the representatives of Najd, or of inducing Ibn Sa , ud to send a suitable envoy to balance /iair Zaid, except by some- \ one visiting Xbn Ba*ud. It seems advisable provisionally to accept the envoys* proposal to adjourn the Conference until 5th Larch, and allow the Najd envoys to return and consult their principal. There appear to be obvious objections to my going to 'Uqair, and I have considered the advisability of Daly being sent, but, in addition to the fact that Ibn Sa’ud was non too pleased with him over what happened at Bahrain last June, he would not carry sufficient weight, and the only solution seemd to be that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should interview Ibn Sa*ud at ’Uqair at the earliest conven.\ent date. My lettersto Ibn Sa l ud regarding the stage at which matters have now reached and regarding parallel 32° will go on k 3lst January and copies will be sent to Bushire (the despatch to which they form enclosures leaves me for Your Grace tO“day). I could write a third letter explaining the difficulties in regard to the second breach of faith commit ted by the Najd envoys, which Trevor could use at his discretion,/ as also the fact that the president, Baiyid H&amp;mzah is a refugee from Justice in Hijaz, has served Ibn Rashid if not others before Ibn Sa’ud, and commands the confidence of no one. Perhaps he might also usefully comment on his selection of Mulla Hafidh, who is well known as a persona ingr&amp;ta to the British, a fact which Ibn Sa’ud may perhaps not know.

In regard to the question of your leaving by the next steamer for Al-Has^.a I am inclined to think that it is advisable and have recommended to my Government that you should go but I am unable officially to give you leave to go until I receive instructions from my Government.So that,if you decide to leave, you do it on your own responsibility. I am equally unable to make any change in your official position which has been conferred upon hy you by His Highness the Sultan of Hejd. I have reported certain facts to my Government and have asked them whether,in the circumstances reported, there is any use in my continuing to confer with you on the subjects, for the settlement of which the Conference has been convened. I await their reply. In regard to the question of Shaikh Hafidh, as you are fully aware, he was the bearer of a proposal made to His Highness the Sultan of Hejd,coming from myself as representative of His Majesty’s Government. That Government is naturally interested to hear what is the reply of His Highness the Sultan to that proposal. I do not propose to dicuss that reply either with him or with you but I wish to hear what it is^so that I may communicate it to my Government for their information.

II it be agreed on these fundamental points we c n then easily come to -n agreement on the other points at issue, viz. the return of plunder, pay men tjB of blood money for those killed can be settled by a committee composed of representatives of both sides who would decide c^.ses relating to plunder and blood money after hearing full, evidence, .ommi Vu&amp;es ol uoih tides, eTfbTT *** f t is stated in the filth clause of the Naj d delegates demands that Ibn Taih, a Shaikh of the Huwaitat, attacked big caravan of Najd merchants and plundered everything to the estimated value of piim £ T.80,000 in gold. The representatives of Najd have not stated the date and place at which the alleged incident took place. If it is alleged to have taken place recently, it is untrue; and,if&gt; 3 ^ long ago,it was before the- 2 - Govcrnment of Trans Jordonia came into being. To the best of my belief and as far as I think^the offender is Za’al Abu Taih who left Trans-Jordania as a fugitive from justice and at the present time is with the ^ajd Government, and claimed by them as one of their subjects of the Huwaitat tribe, and I remember that a portion of the plunder was returned by the Syrian Government. It was also stated in the same clause that eleven men, inhabitants of Jauf, were shot in the market place of ’Amman without having committed any offence. To this I reply that the men in question were highway robbers who at that time attacked the workmen of the Railway line between Qasr az-Larqa and al Mafraq killing six men and stripped them of their clothes and^in accordance with the orders of the Government the troops at the salt villages followed them up and arrested them and sent them to ’ Amman where their crime was proved in court and they were punished in accordance with the law. It was stated that the son of ’Abtan bin Jazi of the Huwaitat attacked a caravan etc suut but the name of the son of ’Abtan is not given and xhijuaxha* I do not agree that the Bani Sakhr attacked Ibn Sharidah’s caravan. It is a peculiar thing that the delegates of Najd at one time claim that part of the Huwaitat are under them and at another complain of Huwaitat atteha-s S^Naj d subjects. The village^ attacked by the Ikhwan near ’Amman^is Umm al-’Amad and the incident took place on the 1st September 1922 and the people who attacked were of Sajir headed by Ibn Muhaiya of the ’ Utaibah and about two months later Ibn Rubai’an and his Z followers of the Dahimah refuges attacked the Bani Atiyah at the ©yf— 8 pil/gr ims station plundered their donkeys . Two months ago Dawish and his followers attacked the Fugara tribe. At one time the Najd delegates say that the Fugara are their subjects and at another they say that they attacked them.COLv N .1.

President and Secretary of the Confer nee alec present. Uie President opened the proceedings by informing ‘■iu ..eju delegates that iraq had ceased to insist on the condition that any agreement come to here depends on a lasting agreement between Hejd sad Hedjas. Xhe hejd delegates noted the fact, .he President then proceeded to take up the Iraq points. iht lirst point was left over until Nejd put forth its claim*, as regards the 2nd point the draft agreement between hejd and Iraq to prevent the tribes from raiding was read over and slight alterations, reached in discussion, principally in the direction ol baghdad ielegiam Ho. 4 dated 3.1.24 para 2 -wa*. agreed to. It was arranged that by next meeting of the Conference an agreement in due form between Sejd and Iraq delegations should be presented to the Conference, after definite approval by signing at a subsequent meeting. ftith regard to pcinte J and 4, they were merged in an agreement covering the brd,4th and Sth pointe and the matter of appointment of an Iraq .gent in Riyadh should be held over for the present. Bo agreement v/at lound pcsfeible in regard to the 5th point as Sabih Beg, the Iraq envoy, declared ihet he could onlv accept a bare agreement that both rulers should undertake not to raise armed forces within the other’s territories. The Nejd delegation pressed for a definition of the term 'to raise armed V'— ‘2, • forcfed*', and.wnen atterapte were made to define the term, fatih the Iraq envoy, intieted on the ineertion of a elaute tc the effect that triheemen obeying a call of mob. libation must take away their familiee. Un thit refculted hopelete diBagreemenL.r,«bih Beg, could not agree that ” hall a leaf wat better th n no bread' and seemed to prefer that no agreement thould be arrived at on the point. ihe Nejd delegatoe had agreed to a form drawn up by Iraq envoys to the effect: ' that neither party shall raise tribes within the other's territories and that, if tribesmen agreed to obey a call to arms on the other tide of the territory,they should leave th l territory quietly and in a private fashion (and should ta.e away their wives and families)and should do nothing on th© way that would indicate that they were on a warlike expedition** . they agreed to this subject to the omission of the clause * they should leave with their wives and their families’* ,bu ,when they insisted on the ©mission of this clause, the Iraq envoy refused to sigh. &lt;«ith regard to point 6 a formula was easily arrived at which both parties agreed tc sign. With regard o point 7, the Iraq envoy said that this point was raised by ti^em originally but they were no long r anxious ior it and would v/ithdraw their der.und. en this, the s resident of the &amp; 5 ejd delegation said they regarded this as a vital point and that no agreement was possible at all unless an extradition agreement formed part of the proceedings. He said that the whole trouble between the two parties was the question of ti e return of mutinous tribe*srnen and that he was bsolut ly bound by hit instructions and could agree to nothing nor tign any documents,unless this point was conceded. Iraq was at liberty to withdraw their demand but, it they did so, he should raise it on hit own account, ihe Bejd d legate reiterated that ix. was quit impoesiole for them to agree to the return of refugee tribesmen but suggested that this point should be deferred-o- until tue coiiLideralion oi ihe llej dcmandc. A for ula was easily found for point 8 which both agreed that they will be willing to sign. Over point 9 the same difficulty recurr d. In itself point 9 was unobjectionable out,when it came to the question of what should be done with regard to the, return of tribesmen who surreptitiously crossed the frontier without obtaining passes irom their inspector of boundaries,Nejd insisted on the return oi them to their own territory and Iraq said that it could not in no way agree to do so. It here appeared to the president that there was a suitable opportunity for complying with the request made by Uk high Commissioner, ^ ghdad in hie telegram $ 0.34 dated 12 th of ''anu.sry 1924. j-he aclu: 1 ords “ the Iraq Government were carefully considering the best means of meeting Ifan Sa’ud’s wishes regarding the expulsion of the Nejd Shammar from Iraq' were handed to the Nejd delegates in writing in English. They were given the references, numbers and dates and took note in Ar bic of the actual words of the messare. The conference then proceeded to discuss the I*ejd claims. They were iniormed that the return of th&lt; Shammar of Ntjd.or even heir expulsion,was impossible unless they proceeded to commit further offences,in regard to which the iraq envoy explained the precautions that have been taken in Iraq to prev nt the recurrence of offences by them. as regards point 2 ,it was explained that iraq had agreed to be bound by the evidence of Cir fercy Cox as to whether he had undertaken that all plunder before the Ujair agreement should be forgotten. If i ir Percy Cox declared th t he had iven such an undertaking, the Iraq Government would respect it and would agree to withdraw their claim. If not,all plunder taken after the accession of his ^jesty ing Paisal would be 4 brought into account between the parties. The Conference then proceeded to discuss points b and 4 and it became clear that no measure of agreement was foundpo&amp;&amp;l bit: • Ihe Isiejd delegate eaid th t the return of the guilty end refugee trioetmen was absolutely esst ntial to any agreeruent at all. lio thing could be signed unless this point was conceded. In the course of the conversations which took place it was cleaj* that in their view, all tribesmen were guilty whom 'ultan Abdul .^ziz ehcse io declare such. It was a matter oi life and death for H#jd that the tribesmen should not run away nd take refuge with otntr rulers, ihe President her. thought that an opportunity had come to pul forward the suggested solution of the problem hat wat conveyed in Colonial Office telegram Ho.25 dat d the 14th oi d-inuary. He read this telegram very slowly and carefully over to the Conference in Arabic and at the conclusion the Iraq envoy declared that he was in entire agreement with the proposed solution and would be prepared to bind hit Government to enrry it out to the cest ol their ability. The ^ejd deleg tes as.t.ed lor time to consider. As the Conference was risin*;,S^bih Beg explained that, in the matter of Ibn hi^lad, the Iraq Government was quite prepared to agree tnat Ibn Mijlad and such tribesmen as might agree to lollow him could go to Mejd but that the Iraq Govern -ment, in that case, would not permit them to return to Iraq terrilory.

The previous day’s proceedings ere read out by the Secretary of the Iraq delegation and the v&amp;rio s membert of the Conference agreed that the proceedings had been correctly recorded. the Nejd delegates and that question was ”If the Nejd delegates are unable to obtain the consent of Iraq to the return of refugee tribesmen, do th ir instructions permit them to agree to anything at all ? M xefore allowing the question to be put the President said that he had a few remarAs to make to the parties. He suggested that both parties had shown themselves unable to agree on points which they declared vit 1 to their case and he further suggested that,instead of taking up the unreasonable attitude ”ii we cant get this, we can accept nothing at all 1 * , it would be preferable to record in due and proper form the points on which agreement had been reached and also at the same time and in the same document the points on which it had been found absolutely impossible to come to an,, agreement at all, thus, leaving a way of escape to their principals, who could, if they p^e sed, on account of this failure, repudiate the whol proceedings; the envoys would aoleast be able to show some measure of agreement as the result of their labours. There was even, though the President put it forward with some reluctance, yet another way by which they could give some degree of finality to the document itself end that was to solemnly undertake in writing to refer the po nts,on which they were in complete disaccord, to the arbitration of His the Iraq envoy said that he had a question to askprepare a lull and reasoned statement showing why it was impossibly lor them to accept the position of the other side and of course it would oe necessary lor them to undertake to regard the decision of Hie Majesty’s Government on tue points in dispute as conclusive and binding on both parties. After these remar s he allowed the question to be put. ihe -Nejd delegates replied that they regretted they were bound by their instructions which precluded them from agreeing to anything or signing any documents, unless refugee tribesmen could be returned to ^in Sa’ud on his demand. r -iheir ruler had insisted on this in the clearest and unmistakable terms and they could not undertake the responsibility,in this matter,of swerving one line from their instructions. -he Iraq envoy remarked that he was fully aware of tne difficult position in which the Hejd delegates stood;that the private relations between himself and the Nejd envoys were of the most cordial and that hu fully realised the nature ofthe instructions giver, to them and the impossibility for them of any departure therefrom. He therefore suggested an adjournment of the Conference for atleast a month to enable the Hejd delegates to explain fully to their principal ohe impossibility of Iraq agreeing to the return of refugee tribesmen; to explain further that Colonial Secretary was inclined to support the Iraq view and had himself suggested a possible solution of the difficulty which might satisfy His Highness the Sultan and persuade him to modify his instructions to the Nejd fielegates. The matjier would require very considerable explanation and was bound to take time inspite of the fact that Hie Highness the Sultan was at Hassa; that ht had no doubt that,if the two principals were to meet, the matter could be settled by discussion between them and possibly a way might be found to settle the matter in this fashion. The N^jd delegates agreed with all that Iraq had just said. They thought tnat to propose a meeting between the-o- two principalB wat tiie only way to arrive at a really satisfactory settlement but,even failing that.it might be worIhwhile ior tnem to send one oi their number to represent the new state oi affairs and see if His Highness the Sultan ^ould modiiy their instructions, accept the Colonial eecretary^ solution or aroitration by His Majesty’s Gov rnmont. ihe President said the parties atlast appeared to be in lull agreement as to the course they thought was advisable to bring about a settlement but he must insist that they should retire together and compose a joint letter to be signed by all oi them requesting the adjournment of the Conference for such time as they consider advisable. ihe letter might be presented as soon as it was ready to admit of its being carefully translated and that it would then be considered in full conference by the President at 9:30 a.m. on the 21st of January. 19th January 1924.IHANSLa'l’ION. 10 C ir, 19 uh January 1924.

S.G.Knox, C,S.I.,CoI.E,.President of the Kuwait Conference. Sir, With reference to what you said at to-day’s session,viz that either Saiyid Hamzah or ’Abdullah Effendi would have to take a letter from you to His Highness the Sultan, we have the honour to inform you that the Hajd Delegation have met and discussed this proposal carefully,and have decided to request you not to impose this difficult matter upon them, as we know that it would open a wide field for misunderstanding,as if it had been His Highness the Sultan who had stood in the way of the settlement of the dispute between Najd and 'Iraq. in point of fact however, it was the writers, the Najd Delegation who, having been told to show a conciliatory spirit by Kis Highness the Sultan, have shown the utmost liberality in accepting the Major of the proposals of the ’Iraq Delegation whereas our proposals have not met with any acceptance at all from the ’ Hraq Delegation. We therefore think that it is impossible for any one of us to accept the responsibility of going to the Sultan alone, especially when we consider that we can see no sign that they are coming round to our view regarding what is the real essence of our claims,*nd is of vital importance to Najd, viz the question of the A ribes and the return of fermenters of trouble and criminals from amongst them. In addition to this the Najd Delegates have one political principle in demanding the return of rebels and criminals of their tribes as has already been put forward,and they cannot go against their polit cal principles by carrying a proposal which would leave the door open for the enticing away of Najd tribes t hat is the reason why there is not peace and security . We therefore request that you will either send your letter by a messenger who is not a member of the N a jd Delegation, orallow the whole delegation to go for a given period as you were asked to do in the joint letter submitted to you by the two Delegations on the 19th January 1924.

If I have understood,them corr,ctly,ooth the -ejd and Ir. q envoys agree that,if Your Highness and die Majesty King Peisal iully and sincerely agree to observe a draft article which 1 have composed,after many conversations wit both sides and a tercareful and anxiuue coneider .tion on my own pari, real progress would h&lt;ve b en made towarde arriving at a ©atiafactory solution of the difficulties between bo h sides. this dr ft article reads as follows :- ' o th me high coniracting par ties, through their re res mt -Lives present in Kuwait, recognise anc admit the misunderstandings envy and jealousy that arise from the enticing of tribts away fro*'- their rulers into foreign territory and they hereby solemnly bind themselves that they will,persona ly and through their servants and dependents, discourage in every possible way, short of act al expulsion and Violence, the migration oi tribes or tribesmen from the one territory to the ot er except with the cognizance and approval of their lawful Covereign. ihus U ey will not give presents either in money or kind to refugees from the other's territories and they will undertake to look with disf vour on those of th^-ir subjects who encourage foreign tribesmen coming over to them'• or my own part I would add the., even if we cynnot manage to obtain any assurance of complete good faith on the part ol both signatory parties, none the less some considerable advance will have been made by the mere fact of the difficulty having been et ted, in clear and unmistakable term©, and signed by both parties.

The j ejd envoys however express their regret hot their instructions do not permit them to accept this solution without further reference to Your Highness. 1 cannot X th^nk do better then commence by stating the difficulties,from the Iraq point of view,in the way of complying with the Nejd demand lor the surrender of refuge tribes and tribesmen at the request ol His Highness the Sultan of Hejd.This statement has been prepared with full consideration and after consultation with the envoy from Iraq qho declares that their difficulties have here oeen fully stated. These difficulties resolve themselves into three classes; (a) Practic 1 tb) Sentimental (c) Political. Jndi r the head 'practical dii ficul ties’* come: (a) the enormous extent oi the desert country which it would be necessary to guard and manoeuvre over. (b) the practical difficulties of ascertaining the whereacouts of refugee tribes who usually come in by driblets and settle with any of the 200 tribes on the western frontier of Iraq on a line rou hly par lltl to the line between i&gt;hBr .h and b-jaf. th. impossibility of employing force 1st because the forces at the disposal of the fr q Govern ment are insufficient 2nd because there is neither sufficient money nor organiza -tion even if forces sufficient existed, ord. ^ven it t ere were troops and money or organization were effective, the impossibility of troops manoeuvring effectively in such operations and over such large tract of country. under tiu* head w sentimental difficulties'’ come: *he difficulty for King Vaisal, as Sharif and member of-4- 2. ven if thife difficulty could be overcome, the difficulty ior Hie Majesty to go against similar no ions of hospitality which prev il among all classes of his edouin suojects and tribesmen, nit : -*jeety c nnot, howev .r favour .ble he may feel towards ibn Ta’ud and in spite of his sympathy, r.s a ruler, with Sin fa’ud’s difficulties vis-a-vis mutinous and jus runaway subjects, outrage the feelin : s o his own subjects to placate his friend i^in Sa’ud. 3. ihe feeling prevalent in civilised communities, which revolts against the rendition oi reiugees to another State if no crime nas been proved against them beyond that of leaving their own country to take up their residence in a iorei n state.

It wac after consideration oi arguments, tuch as theae, advanced by His Majesty - ing ^^ied that Uie Colonial Secret ry in the teiegrasi, to which I have Ire&amp;dy referred above expressed himself as lollows :« I tT; inclined to agree that it it impossible to consider raiding &amp;t&gt; an extradite ble crime and to share the view that the Government of Iraq c* nnot be expected to reiuse same to refugees from Hejo or to h nd them over to Ion Sa’ud at his request. tn th.e other hand, I see no reason why Iraq should continue to harbour ^ejd refugees who abuse the hospitality of Iraq by using th country as a base from which to raid the Ikhwan. Alter lull consideration oi the coni lictin. views, expressed in recent, telegrams from yourself ana Knox, it occurs to me that the following solution of the problem might produce the desired result, i.e.peace on the border. Uejd trio.e,wishing to enter Iraq, should only be allowed to do so on their giving a substantial ,‘uarante * in money or cattle that they will abet- in from raiding. ' fhe Th mmar and other Hejd tribes, who have already ° established themselves in Ira.,, should also be called upon, under pain of expulsion, to *ive similar guaran ee-« ! ihesc guarantees will be liable to confi&amp;caiion in the evtnt oi raids taking place and, if they were sufficiently substantial ( i.c. uiort than they could hope to obtain from a succtssiul raid), they would pro: a. 1. deter the trioefc Irom aiding. are to b no reason why the abovt; procedure which would of course be reciprocal, should not be used in conjunction with &amp; tribal tribunal such as suggested in ihe second paragraph of your telegram * io.'i of the ord of January. 1 *.6 I would earnestly recommend thie solution which has already in advance secured the consent of Iraq to your Hi hness’s co/iSideration* -^hile there is no doubt that it does not meet * our Highness s wishes in full, yet it is a considerable advance on anything that obtains at present on the border and if it was Steadily worked through the inspectors of boundaries referred to in the tth point submitted by Iraq it would probably of itself act as a deterrent to tribes proposing to cross the frontier.J-t would no doubt oe carefully watched by Your Hi hness 'l servants in the working and provided the draft article were also loyally observed I am not sure that Your Highness in the future would fina very much reason to complain and if, as a matter of f^ct, there w s substance for compl int, possibly, at tome more iavouiable opportunity, 'our highness’s views might command more ready assent. 1 fear that it is absolutely til that lour Highness can hope for at present in this connection. ao sum up 1 would ask iour Highness's views as to: ll) four consent to si -n the draft article provided King Iisal ■: gre s to sign.

Before summons issues, it apps&amp;rs to me that clear orders are required on following five points ,otherwise future meetings of Conference will avail us less than the last meetings. (1) Is economic pressure to be applied,or threatened,to Bin Baud ? If not, I see no chance of agreement or use in further discussion . Resident Persian Gulf informs me that stoppage of Bahrain shipments from Bombay is only mistake oi steamer^ Agents. (2) If answer to (1) is in the affirmative, pressure wilJ lead to little, unless someone sees him and convinces him that h&lt; must yield to necessity and deser^ boundary. ^ ( 3 ) Reply seems required to Sultan s message conveyed ir my telegram No: 57 dated 33th: January. I suggest that it shoulc take form that we regard Khurma,Turaba and Khaibar as essential portions of Hedjaz territory and, if Bultan will not leave Hedj alone , we shall deprive him of Jauf and whole of Jadi Sirhan, where,as mandatory state,we shall make such arrangements as se. suitable to us. He should .^Iso be told that King Hussain has a least as much right to interest himself in Asir affairs as SuJ of Nejd,both being border states, and that in no circumstance* can British G-overnment admit interest of Sultan of Nejd in Kunfidhah on the opposite side of Asir from H e jd boundary ,mo especially as Nejd is not a maritime state expept * or A1 Ah* coast.( 2 ) (4) Reply seems require' to ray telegram No:64 dated A 3 rd: February . (5) Also to question whether Sultan should be pressed to send suitable envoy to Balance Zaid. Although N e jd envoys were at once acquainted with contents of Jerusalem telegram To: 31 dated 2qnd: January, Sultan has not yet been officially informed, much less asked, to send suitable envoy. Lastly, I suggest that, if and when Conference meets, 1 authorised to say that 13th* March has been fixed as time limit for discussions and that agreement must be reached by then subject to ratification . There can be no further references and previous experience suggests that it would be well if all dele gates' instructions contain^clause directing them to record measure of agreement reached without continually saying that, unless certain vital points are conceded, they can sign nothing. This specially refers to Najd. I select 13th: March as suitable mail day* 27 th : is also possible .

The other ways'you suggest would be quite alright if the envoy knew the rofees but it is impossible to explain them by telegram and he would probably muddle the instructions up. I think therefore on the whole my telegram had better go with any alteration of the word 'coal*. Would you please send it accordingly. Yours sincerely, To Major J.C.More,P.S.O.

Sultan of Nejd, Nejd. To Lieut: Gol.S.G.Knox, C.S.I., C.I.E., President of the Kuwait Conference. Dear Friend, I have received with gladness your letter dated the 24th of January 1924 which concerns the questions agreed upon and disagreed upon between ourselves and the Government of Iraq. I originally agreed to participate in the Arab Conference with great pleasure for I prefer right dealing and peace and should endure between me and my neighbours;that each party may rest in internal security and to prevent bloodshed which has occurred Itx. from time to time without essential cause and I put before my envoys before their journey suitable instructions to this end and I look forward eagerly to the approaching of the time when we shall all have good neighbourly 1 - relations. The essential matter m my view is the question of the refugee tribes which is vital for Nejd and I do not see any thinj in the proposals which have been placed before me which will serve as a solution to stop this sedition- face me the least of which will not^be ctble in future to punish the wicked persons and those who transgress the limits refuge in Iraq and I wonder how ih a civilised Government like the Government of Iraq agrees that it should become a place of refuge and a sanctuary for wicked persons and highwaymen. Now the unfounded / for the matter does not require permanent military arrangements of watch and ward^for the Government of Iraq by the mere fact of making clear and proclaiming that she will not allow her territories to be a refuge for criminals would shut the If this door is open to the tribes many difficulties religion of Islam and the local laws. For every criminal who commits-the worst crimes of murder and plunder wall find a safe difficulties,which the Government of Iraq has put forwarders opendoor in the face of the tribes and will put a boundary and a stop to this sedition which it is to be feared will destroy the friendly relations between the two countries Nejd and Iraq-and^if difficulties present themselves in the face of the Iraq Government from such action^then I am ready to help the Iraq Government and to share in the matter of punishment as the original treaty of Mohammerah prescribes. As for the other considerations of hnour these are wrong considerations,for Hio Majesty King Faisal is too high and exalted to protoet- refuge for wicked criminals and the Government of Iraq should he above honouring customs which do not agree with justice.

To Lieut Col.S,G.Knox, C.S.I.,C.I,E., President of the Kuv/ait Conference. -y** Dear Friend, I have received your letter Ho.52 of the 24th January concerning the northern boundaries. I thank you very much for the opinions and solicitude especially your personal solicitude but,with regard to what the envoys of Nejd have put forward as to the prolongation of the boundaries beyond line parallel to the boundary of Syria ? these proposals were founded on the supposition that the Government of Trans Jordan was. an independent Government. If your honour had shown these opinions to the envoys on the consideration that these boundaries chiefly concerned the British Government herself you would have seen that the envoys would have changed their opinions and proposals from those expressed by them for we have full trust in the British Government and in no other and we are convinced that she will guard her engagements with scrupulous care. I cannot agree to the junction of Trans Jordan with Iraq for I have no security against the tricks which the authorities of those Governments raise and you have seen their obstajey in the matter of the return of criminals from which it can be seen that there is their deliberate trickery and I think there is no civilised Government that will approve that \/4L it should be a refuge for murderers and thiejs. a* Our envoys have made plain to you the necessity which impels us to the junction of our boundary with Syria and we are unable to watch the Government of Trans Jordan dominating and our trade and our vital interests but,if the objection really a/' comes from the British Government,then I leave to th$ Government herself to find a solution to repel the danger threatening my country and my tribes now and in the future from the junction of the Government of Trans Jordania with Iraq, and to find aA \ i U - 2 - road for commerce free and safe which will guard our only trade to Syria and E^ypt and there shall be no power to the Government of Trans Jordan over it on condition that there shall be a signed agreement concerning the northern boundary between myself and the British Government direct and that this agreement shall be cancelled and inoperative, if these lands cut of the British mandate and all this because my heart is satisfied and full of reliance on the British Government and perhaps it would be possible to leave the details in this matter to the conversations which will take place between yourself^regarded as representative of the great Government^ and between the envoys at the time which you consider suitable for that.

At the moment I m inclined to deprecate a reiusal to send the Amir Paid unless His ' jesty the - ing of Hedjaz can arrange telegraphically to send somt one of lesser rank and dignity from ha hdad to represent him. o. In the same telegram His xcellency the High Commissioner for Baghdad also throws some doubt on the advisability of the Iraq delegate leaving Baghdad 'until a reply has been received to nox’s letter to In S x» u d M . It is not altogether clear to me to which le tter of mine to i is Highness the Sultan oi ^ejd the High Commissioner refers out ii it is my letter on the crucial question of the tribes, His Highness the Sultan of Nejd has now replied in his letter ho.73 dated the 8th of ebruary 1924 which forms an enclosure to this despatch. It is true that there is a wide difference between the attitude taken up by Ills Highness the of Hcjd on paper and. the attitude ta&gt; en up by his delegates when they come to reduce matters in discussion to the lorm oi an agreement prepared for their sign? ture but if we pin His Highness down to his cl ims as put forward In his letter alieady cited viz ' Hie mere fc.ct of making clear and proclaiming the t Iraq will not allow her territories to be a refuge for criminals', I thin I may oe confident that the Government of? ffl O / S -5- Iraq will noi the an* llect difficulty cv_r icsuin &lt; such a prod mation b nd» in addition, we h vt. the person 1 rc nowledge- -ment by Hi® lajeety the inn of Iraq th a he will in no way encourage out r tncr will actively diecourage the flight of vadouin tribee over the border.

Tiiit reply it civil thanks me lor my efforts says that he hat conferred full powers and agrees that peace is the real desideratum but does noi refer speciiically to the 'rticle which Mng Faisal has agreed to sign, When I asked the Bejd representatives whether they were prepared to sign it on behalf of the Bull n of Nejd they replied th t it would depend upon the attituuc taken up by the Iraq representatives at their next meeting, ihey could do no more at present than hold out hope. As regards the question of the Fultan sending his eon to represent himself, they inform mv that Resident’s letter had reached Ion fa’ad before they left but those letters gave the Sultan the impression that the Conference would meet at th® end of a’ ubruary and, as the sens were in Riyadh, it would be ^uitc impossible for the fultan to arrange to send one of them in tir?e.

Imam . bd ur Rahman writes: rt If we had to deal with these Sh.rifs and others we could do so but we have to deal with this Government which has come between us and them. They neither prevent these H shimites from intriguing as they have prevented us nor will they let us deal with them. The hearts of the people of Rejd have changed and they say that you connive at this: even the Ulema are beginning to doubt'. Letter continues to urge Lultan to return and take action. His waiting at vl H ssa is useless and the position is critical. The Dawish letter says thi t the raiders attack only townsmen and Hejd subjects and leave the Umtair severely alone. Reading between the lines it is possible to construe the letter as a threat and to conclude that the Dawieh, though outwardly lealouL, is st heart wavering. My comment on the correspondence generally is that recent events have produced considerable impression, thst the position is critical and that Sultan may be urged into hasty action though I think unwillingly and rather as a counsel oi despair. 1 t is very desirable that all delegates should attend by 13th March and particularly that Hedjaz should be repres. nted even if the . rnir Znid cannot come, it is important tht-t their instructions should comply with the sense of my lett-r Ko.75 of 8th 1 ebruary lb24 to Sultan of Kejd viz :(1) Agree wherever potBible (2) Hever Bt*y il 1 cant h ve thie X cannot sign anything.

The course proposed in Baghdad telegram 93 of 4th March will precipitate,not postpone,a conflict. Bin Sa’ud’s attitude in regard to Umtair raids is very natural for,if he attempts to control raiders, they will simply escape into Iraq territory and he considers that he has every right to resent Iraq attitude and 9 oriental potentates out of ten would agree with him. The general impression seems to be that Bin Sa’ud must lose ground and Hashimites grow stronger as time passes and therefore it behoves the Hashimites to be scrupulously tender towards the susceptibilities of their weakening enemy and to be careful to allow him no excuse for saying that he has been forced into hostilities cund that it is better to die sword in hand rather than bleed to death slowly. We are in a vicious circle. Hussain promises to send an exalted representative whom Bin Sa’ud never asked for and then says that,if Bin Sa’ud will not despatch a corresponding dignitary, he will not send his man nor even appoint a substitute of lesser importance.If I sent the Nejd delegates within the week off to Riyadh with the Iraq proposals it would be atleast the middle of May before satisfactory Nejd representatives could return. In the meantime according to Bin Sa’ud all malcontents within his territories are flocking to the border creating disturbances in his territories and crossing into Iraq at the first sign of retaliation. Bin Sa’ud would probably not raid Iraq, mere especially if Iraq is on the alert,.but blaze out towards Mecca and Medina and he will say, with some justice that the unreasonable playing fast and loose with him by the Hashimites- 2 - forced these steps upon him when he was ready to treat and showed that he was sc ready. The time when telegrams are full of Turkey, the home of re-action, expelling the Khalifa and cutting off the allowances of the royal family is no time for such mushroom mon,*rchs as the Hashimites insisting on their royal dignities and I think,if they maintain the attitude indic^ated in Baghdad telegram referred to, Muslim opinion will condemn them in their controversy with Bin Sa’ud. I therefore repeat that I consider it most advisable for them to send their delegates by 13th of March and leave no stone unturned to obtain peaceful solution, even waiving their royal dignity for the laudable end in view. Personally I regard hostilities as almost inevitable but it is important that Bin Sa'ud should be put inexcusably in the wrong. I think a clever move by the Hashimites would be to throw themselves boldly into arbitration and say that they are ready, coute que coute, to accept the arbitration of the British Government on all points involved as absolutely final.lt would be interesting to see what Bin Sa'ud would do in such an event and it would pave way for a renewal of conference next cold weather and gain time which seems of paramount importance. -Knox.'

I have just received by mail i’revor's telegram 16 of 2nd March which had probably reached Baghdad before he suggested adjournment of Conference and when I sent my telegram No.83 of 7th March the fact that Bin Sa’ud had accepted Trevor’s suggestion to send his son was not known to me. I may therefore have slightly exaggerated delay involved in return of satisfactor; Najd representatives. They might perhaps reach Kuwait by 24th April. At the same time it will not do to lose sight of the possibility that Bin Sa’ud’s ready acceptance of suggestion was due to the fact that at the time he understood that the despatch of his son in time was out of the question and # when it comes to the point other excuses may be forthcoming.Other considerations of ‘iny telegram 83 and personal telegram however in my view hold good. As regards Baghdad telegram No.100 I agree in the main out I did not gather from Bin Sa’ud’s letter that in his reference to British mandate he included Iraq, for his trade caravans would not ordinarily pass through Iraq territory.

There would probably be no objection to ceding the right to Najd in Jauf and to Trans-Jordania in Kaf, but neither place should be occupied by military. In considering the remoteness from the High Commissioner for Palestine in respect of caravans from Najd to Syria and Egypt, It must be remembered that Trans-Jordania Is administratively Independent and any convention would have to be ... ed by the Trans-Jordanian Government , who 1 should be made responsible by participation in suggested discussion and arrangement to any convention drawn up. moreover, in x±x view of the declaration of independence of Trans-Jordania,.

I gather from what he said that he had been given rath® broad hints that he had better leave ’Iraq, and Shaikh Ahmad will, in my opinion, be very ill-advised if he gives him a permanent sanctuary here - which I believe he does not intenl to do - as tnis would almost certainly lead to further unpleasantness with Ibn Sa*ud. —x Dn pa ucrs, and, i n November 19*0, just a few weeks after the battle of Jahrah, be seceded and came over to Shaikh Sffi im .

It appears that the main fighting took place in the neighbourhood of Umm MaahatH Ha shim north of the western angle of the neutral territory. It Is reported that the raiders seised vast numbers of camels and sheep and 80 tents and then camped on the spot. All *Iraq tribes are greatly excited and ha^ closed in towards the railway. In agreement with me, the fiovemment of *Iraq have sent orders to their envoys not t&gt; proceed beyond Busrah until a full apology and redress have been given for this incursion which renders any discussion between the two Governments impossible, especially in view of Ibn Sa l us l s threats conveyed in his letter No 29 of 23rd February to the Resident, Bushire, that he could no longer be responsible for restraining his tribes. It seems proto** able from these previous threats that the raid now reported was purpetrated by the Sultan 1 s orders. The % Ira ; Govern** went will restrain it # s tribes from retaliation as far as possible, but will find this extremely difficult unless promt reparation Is made. If the raid prove to have been as serious as at first reported, it looks as If it may be necessary to put into force the definite threat of cutting off the Sultan's supplies by sea.
