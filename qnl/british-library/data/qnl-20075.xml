Muscat, Tl Lieut,Colonel T.B.Pria.eaux, C.S.I.,C.I. E., The Hon'tie the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIKS. Sir, I have the honour to forward, herewith,the ousto- ,-iary half yearly statements of the Muscat State finances ^ showing the actual revenue and e^enditure under the Budget heads for the first six months of the year and the esti mated expenditure for the remainder of the year. 2&gt; on the face of them the statements appear to he satisfactory - more satisfactory than for several years hack, 'but I am not certain that the Pinance department of H.H's Government has not on the crest of a wave of opti -aism estimated the revenue for the latter half of the year at rather &amp; high figure® However if the figures are a fair estimate Muscat stands to have a surplus of revenue over expend- -iture for the whole year of something approaching thr ee quarters of a lakh of rupees. g _ j will now proceed to ccnnaent on the various items on the revenue side, Actual revenue from tae Custom seems to have worked out fairly accurately to the esti- -mate hut it should 'be remembered that of the four ^5 consignments of rice from India which arrive yearly three have already come and we only expect one more.To balance this we have had one oil ship in this month and expect another shortly. I should say the receipts for Muscat s a!are slightly 'below what they ought to 'be ana. those for • Matrah a'bout correct. GwacL-or has produced its quota hut there is no doubt we are losing heavily on the outlying customs. This however is a political matter and is 'being taken up separately. The landing revenue has increased considerably and this of course argues an increase of trade hut the item itself does not improve the position as all hut a very small percentage is paid out again to the Contractor. Zakat revenue is all payable in the second half of the year the amount already received representing arrears from last year, Quarantine shows a considerahxe decrease 'but here again the latter half of the year should he more profitable as many people return to Mus- «cao In August and September a The Miscellaneous item includes rents from Go- -vernment gardens ^hire of the stone quarry.municipal tai -es in Uatrah.Beit al lial,pass-port and court fees and other minor sources of revenue. It is a difficult one to estimate and on going into the figures it appears to me we have heen unduly optimistic to the extent of some Rs.5,000, This revenue is collected practically entire- -ly in the latter half of the year and I shall have an opportunity of commenting on and explaining it uhen. The dollar still keeps up and a small increase has heen registered on this account.■Sahai 1 Revenue is a new item. It was included under Sahar Customs/hefore and represents the income from the Government lands in the vicinity of that place. As It is the first year it has heen made a separate item. I presume we must in excuse the ^Finance Minister tov 'being so much out his estimate which shows a prolDahle loss of nearly Bs.9,000* 4 a There are not many comments to make on the ex penditure side. The deaths of one or two of the3) ^ Ruling family will result in a slight savins on that item. Sayud Saeed has not spent auite as much up till now as usual and the administrative oharges show a decrease of over Es.1,000 due mainly to Sahar teing differently account -ed for as explained ahove. Customs contingencies are down at present 'by a con- -siderahle sum due mainly to repairs to Buildings not having Iseen carried out; Military expenditure shows a saving of Es.8,000 - in part due to the saving on the Commandant' s pay during the period between Captain Allan's departure and the arrival of Captain Eccles and partly to less capital expenditure during the first half of the year on eauipment etc.for the Muscat Infantry. There a is also a small saving on the pay of the personnel as numbers have 'been cut down to nearly two hundred. Miscellaneous and Sahar Doth show up 'badly.The re- -marls on these items as appeared on the revenue side apply tier© also, Zakat claims have 'been extinguished and this item will not appear in futureo The Police sch'me has fallen through and will not he A-. - proceeded with for the present# 5. The position under the prevailing conditions is not too unsatisfactory hut as the statements show we are 1 iving ^from' hand to mouth and the effect of abolishing the post of Financial Adviser has not yet 'been felt. The Minister of -Finance ,Sayed Mahomed 'bin Hamad is oom- -pletely illiterate and any accurate arithmetical state- -msnt is entirely heyond him hut 1 have had considerable assistance from Islander Bffendi the Egyptian Director of Customs and also from Syed Liaaat Ali the Treasury Officer, The former has 'been a tower of strength since he 'became Director and it is safe to say that without his energy and pro'bity of character the entire cusyOm^ fabric,and with it the main revenue of the State,would collapse*Jele grain ^rom Government of India. ;;o eeident, Busliire. 1 o. 1466-': , Bated 2ord received 24th September 19134. . y 5 Your tele--:ran - o. 922 of 6 tlx teriber. deputation of Bo^er for four months from Is . ecember arranged. .meanwhile every effort- should 'be made to avoid deficit and result reported to Government 'by rovembor 1L th.

It is satisfactory to not© a strain of optimism in this report, however momentary it may be, which has been so unfortunately lacking in the reports of the past few years. Coming as it does on the eve of Mr. Bower's arrival in Muscat, it augurs well, I trust, for the success of his efforts. Since the despatch of ray last report on the subject in July last, I have not been able to visit Muscat, but hope to do so in a few weeks 1 time. In the meantime every endeavour is being made both by Major Hinde and the officials of the Muscat Government to avoid a deficit.

From—The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel A. P. Trevor , C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resi dent, Persian Gulf. Muscat Finances. I have the honour to invite a reference to Memorandum No. 749-X., dated 1st October 1923 (Serial No. 3), from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department calling for my views on the questions raised by Mr. Wingate in his letter No. 18-R., dated 21st August 1923 (Enclosure of Serial No. 1). 2. I have delayed replying to the abovementioned Memorandum until I had an opportunity of visiting Muscat, and this I have now done, having beeo there on the 5th and 6th December. While at Muscat I discussed the question of the Muscat Finances thoroughly with the Political Agent and the Financial Adviser. I am afraid the financial position of the Muscat State is not at all good. As Mr. Wingate pointed out in his letter above- mentioned there is a progressive decline in Muscat Customs receipts of nearly a lakh per annum. This undoubtedly points to a considerable decrease in trade, but that^it means an absolutely corresponding decrease in trade T am by no means so sure. The Council recently felt constrained to dismiss the second of the Egyptian Directors for inefficiency—the first one having volun tarily retired some little time before and T think that without doubt a proportion of the Customs Revenue has been and is being lost through ineffi- ci/pcy and possibly dishonesty. Further I believe we have the means of remedying this to our hand. 3. Mr. Bower who was originally deputed to reorganize the Bahrain Customs will have finished his job there before the end of January, and his deputation has recently been extended for another 3 months to try 'and settle the Kuwait Nejd Customs difficulties. It has, however, been apparent for some time that Shaikh Ahmed has no desire to settle these difficulties, and just recently Bin Saud has replied to Colonel Knox's suggestion for settle ment to the effect that he has no desire to do so either. It is thus useless to retain Mr. Bower for the service for which his additional period of deputa tion was sanctioned, I understand that Mr. Bower's services are not required for the moment in India and that he has been promised leave in the Spring In the circumstances he will apparently be more or less free for 2| months—from say 14th January to 28th March, and I venture to ask that he may be deputed to inspect and if time permits to reorganize the Muscat and Oman Customs Department. Though I do not dare to hope for such a large increase—averaging Rs. 1,150 per diem—in receipts as he has achiev ed at Bahrein. I fancy Mr. Bower could make a considerable improvement. In present conditions, however, Muscat certainly cannot afford to pay him his salary of Rs, 2,000 per mensem : perhaps the State could pay half. If Mr. Bower could achieve a substantial increase in Customs revenue of course the State could pay up the balance. I venture to ask whether Gov ernment would be prepared to pay Mr. Bower his salary and allowances while at Muscat on the scale on which he is being paid at Bahrain, and allow the Muscat State to pay it back if and when its Customs revenues have increased as a result of Mr. Bower's efforts. I feel almost certain that Mr. Bower's deputation would result in an immediate increase of Customs receipts, and that in the end the Muscat State would be able (as of course it should do) to pay for his deputation. 4 If Mr. Bower's services can be utilised in this way and he is will ing to tackle the Muscat Customs problems, I feel sure as mentioned above, a considerable increase of revenue will result. While at Muscat I went into the possibility of raising revenue by other taxes. The only other taxes which could be suggested were (1) Excise Licenses for spirits, opium and allied drugs. (2) Municipal tax on house holders in Muttrah and (3) Octroi on all camels coming into Muttrah from the interior, and I instructed the Financial Adviser to go into these and see whether they were feasible and what revenue they were likely to produce—nothing very much, I fear, less than h a lakh all told. 7 % ^ V f J'2 5. I attach for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter from the Financial Adviser together with its enclosure a statement showing the actual revenue of Muscat State from 1st January 1923, to 30th November 1923, together with the estimated revenue for December 1923. This shows that there will be a deficit on this year's working of Rs. 1,05,272 in spite of expenditure being reduced to the lowest possible level I rather fear that the improved Customs Revenue and the result of the above taxes will hardly cover this deficit, and in any case will not be sufficient to place Muscat State Finances on a sound footing. 6. It results from the above that it will be necessary either to increase revenue permanently or reduce expenditure very considerably. The first can only be done, as far as I can see, by raising the ad valvrem r&amp;ie of customs duty from 5 per cent, to 7^ per cent, or even 10 per cent. It will be remember ed that when I was at Muscat in 1910 the late Sultan Sayyid Faisal denounc ed the Commercial Treaty of 1891 simply with a view to getting the Customs duty raised to 7^ per cent., and to do this is practically the only object to revising the Treaty. The Customs revenue would of course be nearly doubled if the rate were raised to 10 per cent, though perhaps not quite as volume of import might be reduced. I very much doubt, however, whether it would be suitable to raise the rate of duty in the manner suggested by Mr. Wingate, without previous reference to France and America who have treaties with Muscat which also fix rate of Customs duty at 5 per cent. This point, how ever, is one for the Government of India or His Majesty's Government to decide, I am not qualified to express any useful opinion on the subject. 7. In regard to reduction of expenditure the only thing I can suggest is to reduce the Sultan's Privy Purse from Rs. 10,000 a month to 5,000 temporarily and with the proviso that the difference will be made good at all events for the period H. H. is in Muscat if and when the State Finances permit. The only other relief in expenditure which I can suggest is within the power of the Government of India to accord and might take the form ot— {a) a remission of repayment of the loan or at all events a postpone ment of the repayment of instalments for say 5 years; or {h) a contribution to the cost of the Levy Corps; or (c) an increase in the subsidy. Of these I think (c) may be ruled out straight away. In favour of (h) it may be urged that the institution of the Levy Corps has saved the Govern ment of India the very large expenditure involved in keeping a regiment at Muscat. On the whole, however, I consider {a) much the best course and recommend it to the Government of India for favourable consideration. 8. If the Government of India are disposed to consider this proposi tion favourably I beg to recommend— (1) the deputation of Mr. Bower for 2| months to inspect Muscat Customs and see if there is any method of increasing receipts; (2) the introduction of the taxes mentioned yielding perhaps 1 rather than less than \ a lakh per annum; (3) the temporary reduction of the Sultan's civil list to 60,000 per annum; (4) the suspension by the Government of India of the repayment of the loan for 5 years or till such time as the Muscat Finances have been rehabilitated sufficiently to enable the State to con tinue repayments of the loan. It is possible that the measures suggested in Sections (1), (2) and (3) above will result in sufficient increase of revenue and decrease of expendi ture to enable the repayments of the loan to be reecommenced within the next year or two. 9. In the meanwhile the Government of India and His Majesty's Gov ernment will perhaps be pleased to consider the question of agreeing to an increase of the rate of Customs Duty; this can be done in connection with the Revision of the Commercial Treaty which has now been on the tapis* The acc from J mm ber 31st. 1 shouli showed a de: of Rs, 1,05, lowest level i is clear that of the year, Should to 10 per cei the State, certain sum Except ] report.

Suggested form of register is attached. It would perhaps be better to have a separate register for steamers in order to avoid confusion and to enable totals for steamers and native craft to be arrived at easily. This refers primarily to Muscat and Gwadur* I mport Prooetlure Agents have been requested to file steamers' (a) Steamers manifests with each entry therein having a serial line number (this line No* will ordinarily be the Bill of Lading No- as the mft. is merely a list of the Bs/l issued), the- have also been requested to quote this line number on the delivery orders issued by them. This same number will be entered by im-oortors on their Declarations. The importer will rresent his Declaration with Delivery Order and invoice (if required) to the Storekeeper who willwill satisfy hinnelf that tho packages are in the Customs House and will give the date of expiry ^ree storage in + he Declaration and sign same. The inn or tor will ta&gt;-e his Declaration to the Register clerk who will give the Declaration a serial number (yearly series). This can best be done by a duplicating numbering machine. He will enter against the relative serial number (already entered in his register) the date of presentation, the vessel's and importer's names. He will then refer to the relative entrv in the manifest - using the line No. to find t and will enter the declaration No* against the item the ^ntrv^- after satisfying himself that the particulars given in the Declaration agree with those manifested. In cases where there is a marked discremncy between the descriptions e.g. where declaration*shows sugar' but mft shows 'co^fee'S a note will be made on the reverse of the decimation e.g.'manifest shows coffee' and imprter will be required to find out from the Storekeeper what the cargo really is.

If the declaration is wrong importer will be permitted to alter same free of charge« -There the manifest shows more than the number of packages given in the declaration the Register clerk will note the number covered by the particular declaration against the quantity shown in the manifest.

Statistics . After a manifest has been closed the clerk in charge of compiling trade statistics should compile his state ments from the steamers' manifests and for this Tt/^pose it will be sufficent for him to keep a rough register with the various heads under vrhlch trade is recorded noted therein and count up all the bags, or packages etc of a -particular commodity entered in the manifest (taking the figure noted( given correct# For this purpose he should keep a private rough book to record the values of sta^ple conmodities*v-f the reverse of the declaration which will then go (with samples if any) to the a^raiser who satisfies himself as to the value etc :;ivon in the declaration•The appraiser will send the Decimation to the Accountant to calculate duty etc and those calculations will be checked by the Local Director who will enter the total amount of charges in writing in the declaration.

IDEN TIAL . NOTE Oil THE TREATY BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND MUSCAT, DATED MARCH 19TH 1891. I The articles relating to Customs matters may be summarized as follows : t Art. 6 provides for tlie levy of an import duty not exceeding 5^ on the value of all i&amp;js goods and merchandise, of whatever description, imported by sea from foreign countries. The duty shall be paid at the port where the goods are first landed and shall on payment thereof be exempt from all other Customs duties or taxes. No higher duty shall be claimed from British subjects than that which is paid by subjects of the most favoured nation (See also latter part of Art. 2). Exemptions . (1). All cargo intended for a foreign port which is transhipped or reshipped,provided such goods are declared on arrival of steamer as for transhipment to a particular destination and are so transhipped within six months or without changing owners. (2) All cargo, not consigned to H.H. the Sultan's ports which has been overlanded and is re-shipped within one month and which has not been removed from the Custom House. (3) Coal etc. for H.M f s. Ships. (4) All goods landed owing to stress of weather etc. if taken on board same or another vessel. Art. 7 . No article whatever shall be prohibited from being imported or exported. No other Export duty to be levied except with the consent of H.M's. Government. Art. 8 . deals with shipping, tonnage and harbour dues for the improvement of Muscat and for construction and maintenance of lighthouses, etc. ArtArt. 9 allows for the option of paying duty in kind if the nature of the goods allows. Vlaue is to be levied on market price. Foreign goods are to have value fixed on Muscat market price : native goods and produce on market price at place where the merchant shall choose to pay duty. Disputes as to value are to 'be decided 'by reference to two Experts, each party nominating one. If these experts disagree they shall choose an Umpire, whose decision shall he final. Art. 10 prevents vexatious delays or obstructions to goods in transit and for facilities to be given for their transhipment. Art. 11 de^ls with casualties or wrecks, etc. Art. 25 provides for revision of treaty after twelve years (sub- -ject to twelve months' notice). MOTE PIT CUSTOMS RULES . The Customs authorities in Muscat and other ports in Oman are following the directions drawn up in 1920 and embodied in Order No. 110, dated 15th January 1920. This Ord^r is itself based on the articles relating to Customs duties etc. contained in the Treaty of 1891 which have been summarized above. I offer the following remarks on these directions Clause 1. Prices . The market price at Muscat varies from time to time and it is not laid down what rate should be adopted. The price should be that ruling in the market on the date of importation, which, for the purposes of Muscat, may be taken to be the date of arrival of the steamer. Clause 5. n ayment Q{ff duty . The option of paying ( vide Art. 9) duty in kind is not often availed of at Muscat and has in fact only been allowed recently in one case of a consignmerl of rice. The Director Of Customs usually exercises his dis cretiondiscretion to refuse such payment on the ground that the nature of the goods does not premit of such payment. It is not a satisfactory method of receiving duty for the follow-' -ing reasons It is often difficult to tell whether a consignment is homo- i -genous throughout and there may be considerable varations in quality, part damage, etc. The selection of the portion to be taken in kind should be made by the Customs authorities. At outpotts disputes as to valuations are often best settled by the Customs Director taking duty in kind. There is also the risk of deterioration pending disposal, of a considerable fall in value owing to the market becoming over-stocked with cargo which has been cleared rapidly on payment of duty (either in cash or kind) and of merchants forming a 'ring' against the Director when he attempts to dispose of goods taken over. In practice therefore he usually obtains privately a firm offer covering his valuation before consenting to accept duty in kind. The goods are then sold in public auction or by private treaty and the proceeds credited to Government and the sale receipt number is shown in the declaration for reference. The question of disputes as to price is left finally to an umpire chosen by experts but the Customs Director has no power to object to the umpire so chosen. Clause 6 . For 'to' read 'not' and for 'in' read 'if' (or 'provided'). The sentence will then read 'Invoices need not be translated provided full details are given in the declarations etc'. Clause 7. 'No fault of the importer' should be amplified to 'no fault of the importer or shipper'. It is usual at most Custom Houses to hold importers responsible for faults committed by their shippers and they have a remedy against the shipper for any penalt3r they suffer. Clause 9 . The second proviso viz . non-arrival of the delivery order can usually be overcome by obtaining a telegraphic delivery order or by paying a deposit. This should be : insis te&lt; maminsisted on 'before waiving wharfage dues. Clause 10. provides for weighing at all Customs Houses in Muscati « * ' and Oman. This should 'be more generally enforced. Clause 12. Bond 'between Muscat and Mattrah. Actually no bond is executed nor is the transport of goods ordinarily allowed at the option of the merchant. It is usually only allowed where cargo has been wrongly landed. in Duty is credited at the port where goods are first landed ( vide Art. 6). Clause 1 a » Three forms of transhipment are provided for (1) cargo intended for a foreign port ( vide Art. 6). (2) overlanded cargo ( vide Art 6,2). (3) cargo transhipped owing to stress of weather etc. (vide Art. 6, 4). All these are subject to certain conditions laid down in Art. 6. In each case a supervision fee of Es. 2/- should be charged. There appears to be some difficulty over the first form via . goods intended for a foreigh port. Mer- -chants contend that provi^ted notice is given prior to or immediately on the arrival of the goods that they are destined for a particular foreign port free transhipment must be allowed (other conditions being carried out). The Customs authorities contend that if the goods kszk are pert-marked 'Muscat' they were not intended for a specific foreign port and Muscat are therefore entitled to the duty thereon as the goods are manifested for Muscat. In India the Sea Customs Act (Sec. 128) of 1878 permits transhipment without payment of duty at certain specified ports provided the goods are specially and distinct- -ly manifested at the time of importation as for transhipment to some other port. In practice, where sufficient cause; is shown, manifests are allowed to be amended to show packages for transhipment. Owing to the possibility of packages not reaching the destination for which they have been declared I am not in ; favourfavour of allowing free transhipment unless the packages arrive port-marked with the port of ultimate destination and are specifically manifested as for transhipment to that port or alternatively unless the goods are marked say, LINGAH via MUSCAT and manifested accordingly Change of destination after shipment incidentally affects the export trade statistics of the country of shipment. Ordinarily, amendment of the manifest should not be allowed so far as adding that certain packages are intended fa: for transhipment is concerned. Clause 15 refers to export manifests only. Clause 16 , The charge of Es. 5/- refers chiefly to such certificates -s as Landing Certificates, short delivery certificates, weighment certificates, etc. It is not intended to take the place of a survey fee and I suggest that where packages are surveyed by the Customs Authorities at the consignee^ request and such survey is not necessary for Customs purposes a survey fee of He. l/- per package be levied subject to a minimum fee of Rs. 5/- for each survey. In addition to which the Survey certificate will cost Es. 5/-. Where packages are surveyed or examined solely for Customs purposes no charge will be made, but if the consignee requires a certificate of such examination a fee of Es. 5/- will be charge for same. Clausel? . The Ilm Khabar amounts to an extension of the practice provided for in clause 12 to the other ports of Oman. It really is a bond with security because the local Customs Director does not grant an Ilm Khabax without taking security for the arrival of the goods covered thereby at their destin- -ation. The security is not released until the Ilm Khabar is returned with a certificate that the goods have arrived and that duty has been paid thereon as per recei/pt ITo Clause 19 Overtime fees for'Uis charging cargo through the Customs'i.e. presumably 'taking delivery of cargo from the Customs' Es.®' I6 dD Es. E g* Per day of 6 hours 8 - per hour ' I it «i 3 tt 4 z »♦ &lt;1 ' 11 hour 2 ' 2 ' ' The last item should be per hour or portion thereof exceeding 15 minutes. (Under 15 minutes need not ordinarily be charged for). Separate rates are given for export viz. For every package smaller than a kerosine oil tin 1 pie i.e. l/l2 of an anna. ' ' H larger ' ' kerosine oil tin 2 pies i .e. 1/6 of an anna. Thus for imports Overtime is charged on time basis whereas for exports it is charged per package. Comparing these two rates 384 small or 192 large packages are allowed to be shipped for the same charge as one hour f s work,or.762 small or xk 581 large packages for i day's work and twice these number for a whole cay. The exemption of mail steamers only covers the discharge from or loading of such steamers and does not uover the clearance or export of such cargo through the Custom House — except in case of bona fide passengers' luggage. The last clause refers to the rates given in clause 19 and not to the other rules contained in this Order.ooofldof OOO^ a- — u &lt; :y '^ ' The Muscat rate is extremely low and there would appear to be a good case lor raising the rate of duty on these luxuries .

Unfortunately the merchants usually try to take an unfair advantage by raising the retail cost of all articles by considerably more tnan the equivalent increased amount of duty * The inriabitants of Oman as a whole are not rich and can- uot well at± ord to pay higher prices for trie necessities of lite and it is possible that imports would show a falling off to such an extent that no extra duty would be realised ® as stated previously the treaties with G-reat Britain and France would require alteration. 1 believe also the .igree- ments with tne shaikhs oi the Interior would have to be mod if i— ed^and an increase 01 duty would doubtless be used as a His political lever to alienate Mish Highness the Sultan's authority and to foster disrcontent , particularly at outposts where considerable difficulty is experienced in collecting the present duties» as far as my information goes the general rates of import duty in dome neighbouring countiiea are as follows India 15% 'Yemen il$ Hejaz lo^ Bahrain 5^ Iraq 15^ Kuwait 11^ Hasa 8^ Oman 3%.

Shey leave Soor loaded with dry dates, dry lemons, skins, fish and other products of Oman and they return to 3oor fully ioaded with rice, grains, cloth etc. The merchants, who are very clever in smuggling obtain from India different manifests in na^ae of Foreign Ports and also obtain a manifest to Soor in which few packages are entered. They get the goods exported from India in the name of the Foreign Ports and land** same in Soor at night or they get landed m Aaja, a Village opposite to Soor, which belongs to Amir of Ja 'Ian. Boats returning from Busra, ^zibar and Aden never produce their manifests to the Customs and they get all the goods in them smuggled. Soor is an Island like and it is very difficult to guard the whole coast at night and moreover if the guard diacovera any theft, .uad the matter is reported by the Local Director there, unfortunately no action is taken. We tried to get the boats examined aa aoon as they anchor but all our efforts have gone in vain and Soor people refused entirely to allow Customs Officials on board and the Goven^ent could not do any thing in the matter.

A vessel capable of aocoramodating two or three superior Officers and, aa Deck passengers, a Detachment of 50 to 100 'Askaria' with machine guns would be the sort of thing required and would probably run to 75 or 100 tons.

It raust be remembered that to keep a sterner in regular commission she would require to be Dry-Docked and overhauled every few years and ohe nearest place where this could be done properly would be Karachi. Taking this Ury-Docking into account the cost of running and upkeep would be an expensive item and would probabl; -or-, out on Em average not much under lis.8000/- a month or ^4000/- a year allowing for.say, three trips each to the most distant outports ilorth-i/eat &amp; aouth -Sast. 'i'hese figures are of course only a very rough estimate as unless the size and condition of the boat andher coal consumptio number of crew etc. are known it is not possible to estimate at all accurately Jier* running oost.

(underlined in red in the attached map). It— - t .. — ^a—g»c' ■ - @) « It would certainly havs a very healthy effect on the revenues oi otiiar ports and would increase the prestige of, and respect for, the Gov eminent • Supplies could be taken quickly to an y garrisons that inight 'be stationed at the outports in supcort of the Government. It is also suggested that it Could be used to intimidate nakhodas of native craft by examining vessels at sea. Such mxsam examination would not he easy,oven if supported by a boarding part&gt; of Askaris*, and would have to bo confined to the proper three mile limit(or whatever the limit is) as Examination on the high Seas is, T believe, contrary to International Law« What action it would be possible to take if the craft was seized would depend on the state of weather, size of boat and place of seizure etc,but the suggestion that the boat would be towed to Muscat is easier made than carried out. A Government steamer with machine gun detachment would tend to discourage unauthorized landing and shipping at various places but unless definite information was received I do not thmic many oases would result in practice, particularly if the smuggling took place at night. A cert a. in amoun u of savings would xssumx : accrue by carrying stores to and bringing remittances from outports by the Govern ment boat instead of by private craft« Doubtless some of the existing launch establishment could be drafted into the proposed steamer. It is some what significant that the three ports which are most easily reached by the Director General furnish the best results. I do not think a Dhow with a kerosine oil Engine fitted in it rtould 0 3 satitaiactory in practice and a new Dhow and new Engine would probably cost more than a serviceable second hand steamer. Alternatives oo a i.Iusccio Government (steamer motor boat) (a) the occasional support of a British Man—of-War or R.I.lu ship and (b) to have or to hire a sailing craft capable of carrying a numbernumber of men and officers as suggested in the oase of the uovemment steamer. The former would only be possible at considerable intervals and is a matter for the political Department, The Sailing craft would be an expensive item as it would be able to bake so few trips in the year and much time would be wasted at Sea which could be spent much more profitably by the Director General on shore» The scope of such a native craft would be very limited and would often destroy the surprise nature of a vlsi'^, as information would reach the outports before the sailing crafto It would alB(3 be unsuitable from a military point of view as it might take many days to carry men or stores to the distant ports 0 The nature of the Uoast line and the number of different tribes and local feuds etc. renders any sufficient system of shore imtrols very difficult and in places impossible« It would require too many men to be profitable. All that can be done in this direction on land is for Local Directors to make patrols from tine to time as far as possible and also to obtain what information they can as to whether any unauthorized landing or shipping takes place, vor this pnrpotJe the headmen of coastal villages should render every possible assistance and should be rewarded for any cases which the7/ bring to lights In order that the Director General of Customs may have all possible information of cargo carried by native craft and be able to exercise some check thereon arrangements have been made with the Customs authorities in British India and Busrah to send to Muscat copies of manifests of native craft clearing 1 for Oman ports 0 I have made similar arrangements with the Persian Customs authorities&lt;, Zanzibar and Aden are being asked to do this also. In the case of native craft declaring cargo as shipped for different destinations a further safeguard is necessary to prevent manifest, being taken out for, say, 100 packages only forfor Sur and the balance of the cargo being manifested for Mukalla or Zanzibar or other ports outside Oman with the result that the IDsp Director General of Oustons at Muscat receives a copy of the Sur manifest covering 100 packages only, this amount is duly A passed through the Sur Customs and the rest of the cargo is smuggled ashore there and is not actually carried on to Mukalla or Zanzibar, I understand that the Sur merchants have undertaken in writing to have all cargo carried by their boats manifested for Sur but they are not abiding by this undertaking, although the cargo is actually being landed clandestinely at or near Sur* 'Jo combat this I hope to be able to arrange, when I return to India, with the Customs authorities to send the Director General of Customs at Muscat copies of all manifests covering cargo shipped by boats clearing for Oman ports, whether declared for Oman ports or not.

Dried sardines form softer dates, the principal exports of Oman and in 10^3 amounted to 32 ,700 packages valued at nearly Rs• lakhs# The trade of ports on the North Batinah coast - and to some extent of Muscat, Matrah - has been seriously affected by the opening of Dubai as a regular port of call for mail steamers and important places in the interior, such as the Bereimi oasis, now largely draw supplies from Dubai. The rumoured re-opening of direct steamers from Europe to Muscat may result in an increase of imports as prices should be lower than at present because transhipment expenses at Indian ports would be avomded. The Customs revenue however, would pro- bablv not be materially increased.@ ^ Trade statis^iog&gt; « I have only seen figures for Muscat and Matrali which for purposes of trade statistics have 'been ta^kren together# I have made a comparative statement of the trade of these ports for the seven years ending 31st March 19^4 show ing therein the values in £ sterling (£1-Rs• 1^) o: p imports 'by steamers and by sailing vessels.

The reason given for this unsatisfactory result is that the date caravans hich were expected to reach Soor during the last four raonths of 1024- did not arrive (they are reported to be coming in dfating Jan.102^) There is also little doubt that there is considerable leakage of revenue at Soor, (this ferns the subject of a separate note) Khabooralol Khaboora registers a. shortage of 14^ attributed to disputes amongst the local tribes over the cutting of firewood, exnorts of which have fc .llon considerably# « Fron statenent II it will be seen that the trade at Gwadur has developed steadily during th o last ^our years• 0^ the other hand Matrah and Musana'a both did ouch better in /9 3L/^-192S than in lOSo and 1924.

The latter figure should be shown under Miscellaneous in the Treasury Accounts as it is a non-recurr* ^ ing iter. The pay of the Customs Department kroner, therefore, amounted to Rs .91 ,5l8 of Rs.88,^03 in 1923. The excess of Rs29i5 is due chiefly to the sacxmaiat payment of salaries for | 1 the whole year to the staffs at Saham, Sahar, Hejies etc whereas they were only raid for part of 1923 in which year these -ports were taken over by the Customs Department. Continnencier . All Muscat Rs.500 is drawn every month to meet contingent expenses at all the ports on the Arabian littoral; an'^ balances that may be carried over from one month to the next are spent on minor repairs to the various Customs Houses, wharves etc. Where major repairs, cost of stationery. Director-General's travelling allowances etc cannot bo mot from the monthly contingent fund bills are cashed at the Muscat Treasury after obtaining sanction from the Council .of Ministers. Gwadur meets its contingencies from its collections and during 1924 drew Rs*1,420 or an average of Rs«119 per month.u month.

Also there are many outsorts each requiring seuarate permanent establishments. A^T the larger ports it is necessary to emplo rr a staff sufficient to cone with the work at all times and as the work is spasmodic the men are very busy at times and have little to do at other times. I do not therefore, consider the cost of collection undllily high and do not recommend an3r reduction of establishment.

The year opened with a 'balance of Rs.4S &gt; 527 and clos- -ed with a 'balance of Rs.l,24,438# The revenue for the year under report was Rs#10,85,6l0 as against a total of Rs#9,30.811 collected in 1924# The increase this year appears chiefly due to 'better adminis- -trative control over the Customs and also in part to the fact that the Wali of Sohar has 'been made to render accounts instead of appropriating all the Customs revenue of that port# 3» The port of Sur is the only one v/hich shows a notable decrease in the amount of duty collected.This was Rs.50,726 in 1923,while during the year under report the collections totali sed Rs.57,459 only,a decrease of Rs#13,267. This state of affairs is due entirely to the loss of power of control by the Muscat Government and it seems wonderful that any revenue at all is recovered from that place. 4.

The optimism observed in the previous half-yearly report seems to have been justified, and the revenue for the full year exceeded the expenditure by nearly Es. 7b,000/- 3. mr. g . N. Bower's deputation to Muscat has had an ex- -cellent effect on the Customs receipts, which, as a whole, during the year have been the largest on record. The collection of customs at Bur is the most difficult problem, as the lack of con- —tiro 1 there leads to extensive smuggling and a large loss of revenue. Mr. Bower has also improved the machinery by which the customs are collected and effected many economies. i.

I have the honour to forward herewith a six monthly State ment of Actual Hevenues and Expenditure of the Muscat State for the period ending 30th June 1925, and Anticipated Revenues and Expenditure for the remaining half of the current year» I myself became responsible for the State Finances on and from 1st April last. The course and current of expenditure for the year - the Financial year commencing 1st January - had 'by this time 'become fixed, and except for a tew economies I have attempted no reforms 'beyond introducing a double entry system of accounting and a revision of the monthly return. Before referring to the Statistical Statements in detail there are two outstanding and serious features to which atten tion should 'be called. (I) The illusory and misleading nature of the balance of Rs^ 124438/- 'brought forward from 1924. (II) The Excess of Expenditure over Receipts of Rs.19666/- for the six months ending 30th June 1925» 1 Balanced at the foot of Revenue Statement are as follows:-2 i : Balance l-'rougtitt forwapcl ) Hs, 124,^-38 from 1924, i Balance on 30th June 1925. 104,772 Anticipated Balance on ) -i ^ 1 150,322 31st December 1925. ) These balances are apparent and not real. This is due to the practice which obtained here, and which I have continued to obserTe, of 'bringing certain Major Expenditure e.g, Civil List, Military, Administrative Staff etc» to account a month in arrear. Thus it was that December 1924 pay under these heads was met and accounted for not in December 1924 but in January 1925, The balance of Bs.124438/- was in fact the book balance on 31st December last of Receipts over Expenditure brought to account between 1st January 1924 and 31st December 1924. This balance must not be indentified with financial condition of the State at the end of the year. In reality it represents State revenues received to the end of December less State liabilities (at least under major heads} to the end of November only. To arrive at the actual financial position of the State at the end of last year therefore cognisance must be taken of these'carried forward* December charges amounting in all to Ks,69237/- The true surplus will then be seen to have been Us*55201/- only and not Bs,124438/-. The same applies to the balance on 30th June 1925. ^une under the heads in question amounting to Bs. 64523/- has not been taken into consideration as it was ms&amp;e on 1st July and will be brought to account in July accounts. The true balance is therefore not Bs,104772/- but Bs,40249/- only. The system whereby such expenditure is carried forward from the month to which it pertains to the month following, while not open to objection from an accounting point of view, inevitab ly gives rise to swollen and unreal paper balances which in turn lead to a false sense of stability and loose spending. To remedy this it would be necessary to bring seven months expenditure to account in the remaining six months of the year. The anticipated iflianticipated actual Dalance on 31st December 1925, if this were done, would he shown as Rs.85799/- only instead of Es.150322/. (the paper balance as at present shown). 11 Excess of expenditure over revenue of Rs.19666/- for the first six months of the year is not so alarming as it would appear. Advances Eecoverahle (None was accounted for in the corresponding period of last year) amount to Es.7810/-;of this Es.5000/- is outstanding against the Prime Minister. But the real explanation^in the fact that Zakat a major revenue head and this year expected to produce Es.76000/- is collected almost entirely in the second hair of the year. For the corresponding first six months of 1924 Expenditure exceeded Eevenue to the extent of Es.4745/-. This years increase (despite Eevenue collections to date heing Es.10000/- more than last year) is explained hy the following large and unusual items Of Expenditure. (a) Military Expenditure &amp; State Animals. (Chapter 11) * ('b) Sahar Customs Compen sation Case (Chapter IX) P.A's Judgment, (c) l/[r♦ Bower's Depution (Chapter X) \ (d) Furniture for Finan-1 cial Adviser's Hes- ' idence(Chapter Vlll)' * (e) The post of Military Adviser at Beit Felej was vacant for four months of the first six months of the year i 1924: There was no Financial Adviser for the whole ■ period. Actual Expenditure in 1925 now shown includesj pay of former for six months : of latter for three | [ 1st Six mths 24. 76965 1st Six mths 25, 1925 95395 18430* 7500 7500 9509 9509 3000 3000 38439three months. As regards (a) the ezcess is due primarily to the maintenance of State horses and camels, superfluous to Military requirements. Six horses and nineteen camels and their syces have recently 'been withdrawn from Military charge to ef:fect economy, * Items (h) (c) (d) are abnormal and non re curring. Mr. Bower * s Depution will cost the State a futher Us.2000/- in pension contributions. This will fall in the second half of the year. Ill REVENUES (Statistical Statement) Chapters 1 11 ill and V call for no special comment. Budget Estimates have heen realised to date and all indications point to their continued realisation during the remainder of the year. Chapter IV Zakat 'being almost exclusively a date tax and the date harvest falling in the late Summer, Zakat revenues except for arrears is collected largely in the gecond half of the year. See para 11 above. Chapters VI Vll Vlll and LX Collections show a slight falling off as compared ?7ith those of the corresponding six months of last year viz 1924 Ils.6S48/- 1925 Es.4756/- In the oase of Quarantine Receipts this is due to (l) irregular ex emptions (11) evasion by persons representing to belong to the State Army. As regards Passport revenues the falling through of the Pilgromage this year is held to hlame. Although the total sum involved under these minor heads is small it is hoped that an enquiry into each Department concerned will result in speed ing up collection and in Estimates 'being realised. Chapoer X is a ne^v head. An Oil Concession has during the period tinder review 'been granted to the D'arcy Oil Company (A.P.O.C.) A preliminary payment of Es.10,000 was made hy the Company in May in consideration of a Prospecting Licence to run for two years. Financial Provisions of this concession allow of a futher payment of Es.10,000/- in May 1927 for an Exploration Licence also to have a term of two years. Thereafter the State ■becomes entitled under a Mining Licence (if operations succeed Isucceed and are prosecuted) to a royalty of Rs.3-8-0 per ton Ox oil raised and subject to a minuraum of Us.30,000 per annum. Chapters XI and XI1 call for no comment, I'he unnumbered head « Remittances from Sahar ' is a temporary accounting arrangement to meet exceptional local conditions, Sahar maintains a separate Treasury. Its revenues and expenditure have 'been 'budgetted for in the General Budget under Zakat and District Administration respectively. As however its revenues are subject to deductions on the spot to meet local expenditure only nett remittances are received at the Luscat Treasury at irregular intervals. These are conven iently credited under this head until the end of the year when Sahar•s gross revenues and expenditure can he sorted out and allocated to their proper Budget heads. IV EXPENDITURE (Statistical Statement) Chapter ii Military See para 11 Chapter 11 Marine. The State motor Cruiser SilYIDIYAH' continues to he a heavy drain. Half the crew have 'been dismiss ed the captain placed on half pay and every effort is 'being made to dispose of the entire 'burden. Expenditure for the | first six months of this year was Us,3808/- against Us,5665/- for the corresponding period of 1924. To give effect to the decision to replace the 'SAIYIDIYAH' hy a larger sea going craft wherewith to increase supervision and revenues at outlying stations it has 'been necessary to allot a sum of -^s.25.000/- It may 'be considered a moot point whether such expenditure is Justifahle this year in \ the light of the revised 'balances 'but it is locally held that it would prove to he productive expenditure. Chapter 'Vlll Public Works. Exhaustion already of the years allotment arises from the inclusion under this head of an item of Ils.30Q0/- for state furniture.

It is requested that the approval of the Political Resident to the purchase of the steamer be communicated by telegram as Mr. Thomas may have to take over the vessel early in January.

The Political Agent Consul, MUSCAT. Sir, ' III I have the honour to submit herewith for favour of approval . proposed Budget Estimates for Muscat State for the year 1926. Provision has heen made for the purchase and maintenance of a small Patrol Steamer. The re-acquistion of such a steamer is regarded hy H.H.the Sultan and his Ministers as preeminently necessary for this maritime State, 75 % of whose revenues are drawn from customs duties. Mr, Bower also strongly advocated the same course. The presence of a steamer is calculated to enhance the Stated prestige everywhere Tput particularly at Sur where Government authority is as feehle as in years past, and where expenditure still exceeds revenue. Information said to he credible, puts Customs leakage at Sur at over 50 %: and given efficient collections increased revenue there may reasonably he expected to cover largely the costs of running the patrol vessel. At all events it is certain that Y /ithout some such craft local Government's prestige and finances are not suscep tible of any considerable improvement. In framing the Estimates I have refrained from putting Sur's revenue possibilities, vis-a- vis the prospective patrol vessel, too high. An extra Es 20,000/- from Customs there may be regarded as not an extra vagant anticipation. This and a small increase of Es 5000/- anticipated from a reorganisation of Shamaliyah Customs are the only serious departures from this years revenue actuals. f | i | J li i ■ . rf As regards expenditure, the allotment of Es 60,000/- under Marine is a new and serious commitEient. It* is however calculated to prove Productive Expenditure and no less than Es 27,000/- of it represents Capital and Non-Hecurrent expenditure. That it is wholly to 'be met from current 1926 revenues without resulting in a Budget deficit at the end of the year, may 'be regarded as a justification for the measure. The proposed extensive Public Works program also calls for comment. 'For many years past Government forts up and down the coast-at one time handsome and imposing 'buildings and dating from the Portuguese occupation- have had no money spent on them, and are fast falling to pieces. Those at Suwaig and Musana 1 ah I ^ t o ^ tlls pr0Till . cial forts 'being small they can 'be repaired at moderate cost. The fort at Khahura had 'been so much neglected as to have 'become &amp;B: irreparable and has 'been abandoned. As these forts are ill head -q.uarters of District Government i, e., are used as residences! and offices by the various Walis it would, apart from the question 1 of prestige, be uneconomical to permit their decay and later as a result be committed to heavy expenditure on new Government . buildings. Comparison of Estimated Receipts and Estimated Expenditure ■ may be deemed to show a margin too narrow to accommodate possible v ' Unforeseen Expenditure ' In that case curtailment could be made under one or more of the following heads at the time the necessity arises. (1) Chapter 111 Cutting down the steamer's patrols to reduce coal consumption. (2) M Ylll Eeducing the Public Works Program. (3) M 11 Economising under Military Expenditure. The State commenced the year 1925 with a balance of Es 55 ,201/- vide my six monthly Financial Beport, dated 25rd July 25. Independent of this sum our surplus on the current year's ^(rujsvs^ working (1925) promises to be Rs 60,000/- Thus the carrying balance of cash in hand at the end of the year 1925 should be approximate-LI' z - ly approximately Es 115,000/--a stronger financial position than the State has 'been in for many years. The 1926 Budget now submitted is not intended to allow encroachments on this surplus, which it is hoped will 'be carried through the year intact. I hare the honour to he, Sir, Your Obedient Ser vant, financial Adviser, Muscat State, M U SCAT,i KILITAHY.

Mo. 93-B of 1926. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 6th March 1926. From Captain B. Stuart Horner, I.A., I Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To The Political Agent, Hue cat. Sir, I am directed to refer to your predecessor's letter Ko. 155, dated the 5th February 1926, regarding the desire of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to confer the status of a Minister on Mr. Thomas. 2. The Hon'tole the Political Hesident considers that there is not likely to be any difficulty as regards the name and status, but before approaching the Government of India he wishes to be informed whether his views regarding the salutes given to the Ministers, collectively and individually are correct. 3. On the analogy that a British Consul does not fly hiu flag nor receive a salute when hie superior officer 1b In the station he understands that It Is only In the absence of the Sultan that collectively the Council of Ministers, when calling on a Naval Commander, receive a salute of 17 guns, that the President of the Council. aloAe or perhaps attended by one Minister, receives a salute of 13 or 9 guns, according as he is a member of the ruling family or not, and that other members, singly, receive a salute of 5 guns. He also presumes that if two members went together they would only receive the one salute of 5 guns. rv^\JK 4. It would therefore be necessary for His Highness to be away, and all the other members of the Council ill or absent, before any one member would pay an official visit representing the State, and the chances of Wazir Thomas calling officially alone are very remote. 5. If a practice has been established not in accordance with the above views. Colonel Prideaux enquires whether an understanding can be Come to that only in the most exceptional • cases will a Maval Commander receive an official visit — which naturally entails a return visit — from the Council even collectively, while His Highness the Buitan is in residence at the Port.

Sir, I have the honour to forward for the information of the Political Resident a report received from the Finance Minister of the Muscat State covering the first 6 months of 1926, 2. It will be noted that Mr Thomas refers in para 3 to the recent recovery in the date market,which it is hoped will continue. As the revenues of the Muscat State defend directly or indirectly to such a large extent on the price of dates this recovery is most satisfactory 3. It will 'be seen that Mr Thomas hopes to be able to recover the whole of the amount for which he budgetted as Zakat revenue, which is practically a tax on the date crop, before the end of the year. 4. The protracted tour in the Batinah made during April, May, and June by His Highness accompanied by Mr Thomas appears to have had excellent results. Mr Thomas informs me that His Highnesses advice and assistance in revenue matters were invaluable. It is a pleasure to find His Highness again taking an interest in affairs # 5. The registration of fhows which it is hoped to enforce will be on the lines of that instituted in the Bahrain islands. /6. The Steam Launch « General Ell* s « i s expected to arrire at Muscat in September or October, In order to make her of real value in the collection of Customs revenue it will be necessary that she. just as the former yachts belonging to the State,should be armed with a gun. £ I shall make a separate communication to you in this matter. 7. The final paragraph of Mr Thomas* report shows that such matters as the Paris pearl market and the exchange value of the franc exert a considerable influence on the fortunes of a small agricultural and fishing state,far removed from the main arteries of world commerce, such as is Muscat, 8. Tne inances of the Muscat State have been passing through a time of depression, and it is due to the unceasing vigilance of Mr Thomas that expenditure has not exceeded revenue to a much larger extent than has been the case, I have the honour to be.

Sir, FBIAKCIAL KSPORT OF MUSCAT STATE FOE SIX MOInTTES BNDIHG 5QTH JUNE 1926 &gt; I have the honour to forward herewith in duplicate a Six Months Statement of Actual Revenues and Expenditure of the Muscat State for the periord ending 30th June 1926, and Anticipated Revenues and Expenditure for the remaining half of the current year. 1 Before commenting in detail on the individual chapters of the Statistical Statements, I would remind you of the system here obtaining of 'bringing State Expenditure to account a month in arrear which system gives an exaggeratedly substantial appearance to our balances: hence in the summary given at the foot of the Eeceipts Statement, it should he 'borne in mind that wherever Balances are stated, it is necessary in each case to deduct a round A of Es.55000 (monthly normal routine expenditure) in order to arrive at the true financial position- 2 The State has experienced in the first half of this year an acute trade depression which local opinion says it is £ necessary to go 'bade ten years to find a parallel for, and which affords an unfortunate contrast with the abnormal prosperity of the year 1925. The immediate cause ±01 this is to 'be found in the universal slump in the price oi dates and also the inability to market the v/hole of last years Shumailiyah harvest, which customarily is bought up by D^bai almost in its entirety. As the purchasing power of the StateState is detGi*in.iLn6(i by tlie msiPlcBt valu© of its dat© iiapvest tiie Treasury losses sustained not only in date revenue at the time 'but Oust&gt;oms Import Hevenue thereafter, require no elaborate explanation» Money has 'been very scarce, cultivators have in cases mort^gaged this year^ crop and Zakat fanners have inevitably fallen into arrear with payments due to Government under contracts made in the prosperous times of a year ago» Addded to this the Mekran Z% fiscal measure directed against the port of Gwadur and operating since Fehruary threatens our revenues there with a loss of 30000 rupees over i the whole year* In order to meet these combined denudateous I have 'been obliged to exercise a close financial control, resist all proposals involving new expenditure, and make drastic economics from time to time e^s» Public ¥orks. State pensions and contingencies» 3 Revenues. See Statistical Statement. Chap.1 No comment„ Chap.11 The Actuals for the first six months of this year are Es .28^332 as against Es.367892 for the corresponding half year 1925 i.e. a decrease of Ks.85560. This serious falling off already referred to is illuminated by a comparison of average local market prices of dates prevailing in the T£- a^soective years, thus 1925 1926 Batinah dry dates per bahar per bahar Hps.290 Eps.250 Batinah wet dates ' 85 ' 60 / Shumailiyah wet dates ' 110 ' 70 It will lie noticed that I estimate this head to yield Es.390000 in the ensuing year: this as against te.410508 Actuals for the second half of 1925. If this estimate is suspected of an optimism not warranted hy the first six months receipts it may he observed that cognisance has 'been talcen of the following new xactoi^.(a) there has 'been a recent recovery in the date market v/hich merchants are generally of opinion will he sustianed. (h) I have recently established three new customs posts in the Shumailiyah which should produce annually not less than Es. 12000. (c) The prospective Dhow Segistration Tax should if sanctioned, produce Es.5000 in a normal year,. Chap.111 The slight falling off in landing charges follows naturally from shrinkage in trade» This is not an important revenue item, as the sums so received are handed over to the landing contractor^ less only 5^ deducted for management expenses. See note chapter V expenditure which follows. Chap. IT Zakat revenue 'being almost exclusively a date revenue has 'been primarily affected 'by the acute situation* The figure of Es.870 shown in the Statement as against Es.76000 'budgetted for the year is however illusory. The Actuals so far it is not convenient to show for the following reason. Some 70^ of Zakat revenues are collected in the Shumailiyah province the headauarters of which is Sahar. On account of the remoteness of the district from Muscat Sahar maintains its own Treasury. Local Zakat revenues are paid into this and from it all current administration expenses of the four wilaiyats of Sahar, Saham, Liwa and Shinas are met. At the end of the year adjustment can 'be made 'by bringing Shumailiyah revenues and expenditure to account under their proper heads in the Muscat Treasury Accounts. There has 'been considerable leakage in Sahar revenues in the past and the Shumailiyah reorganisation I recently carried out has for its object the remedying of4 of tliis* Chaps • V VI No comment. Vll So Till Chap IX The falling off under this head is due to the drying up of the aovemment garden felej at ¥ataiyah» The decay of this felej is an instance of the fate overtaking most felejes of interior Oman» Desiccation- the people 'bemoan the dwindling rainfall year 'by year an accelerating process said to date from 1915 - is driving the date palm of the upland wadis out of cultivation and the cultivators from their ancient habitations• there has 'been a steady exodus of tribesmen to the Batinah and to Zanzibar» The inevitable diminshing wealth and purchasing power of the thirsting interior is a factor to heed in any future computation of the State*3 taxable capacity^ Chaps comment, X &amp; XI Chap XI1 This item is misleading unless read in conjunction with chapters X (g) Expenditure Statement. It is relatively unimportant. The use of different currencies makes it necessary for the Treasury to make exchange transactions from time to time. Such transactions appear on both sides of the account and normally cancel each other out, without any substantial margin of profit or lass. 4 Expenditure. See Statistical Statement. Chap 1 No comment. ^ Chap11 Increase is due to cost of maintenance of Bait al Ealaj of civil administration camels in excess of military requirements. Chap The saving under Marine is due to five months 111 delay in the purchase of the patrol vessel, and consequent costs of maintenance for that period %period not arising» Chap♦ IV The Actuals for the past six months shovm in respect of Civil Administration do not include costs of four Shumailiyah WilXaiyats. See note ahove under chapter 1Y of Revenue Statements The anticipated increase under customs administration arises from the recent estahlishmant of three new posts» The considerable sum total savings under this head are due to drastic cutting down which has 'been resorted to in the face of falling revenues. Chap. V See note under chap 111 Bevenue Statement. Chap.VI no comment. &amp; Vll Chap.Till Public Works programme has for reasons of economy 'been completely cut out except for the reroofing of the Muscat Customs TCharf. Chap.IX No comment. Chap X (a) The increase under this head arises from an unforseen and protracted tour of H.H. the Sultan in the Batinah. If this item he excluded, the normal actuals have 'been Es.1718 only as against E3.5926 for the correspondinig period of last year. (■b)(5c(c) Additional expenditure under these heads is to he read in connection with 3-.E• s. unprecedentedly long stay in Muscat this year. (d) Stationery expenditure for past six months is K3 .68I as compared with Es .2305 for the corresponding period of last year • (e) Customs contingencies are up as a result of the establishment of three new posts. (f) General contingencies expenditure for the past six months is Rs.453 as against Es.2538 for the corresponding period of last year.(g) &amp; (i) No comments• See note under Revenue Statement chapter Xll Reference to the summary of the general financial position given at the foot of the Revenue Statement will show an aticipated slump in our Reserve for the whole year of Ks»50000. Against this we shall hold 36000 rupees in capital value as represented 'by the Patrol Ship 35000 Rps. State Barge 3000 w In view of the lean year through which we are passing this position, if realised, may 'be regarded as a satisfactory a one. I have on previous occasion pointed out that the unprecedented financial obligations imposed on the State 'by the concurrents (a) Maintenance of Muscat Infantry ('b) M ' patrol vessel (c) Refunding of the Government of India loan^ make the 'balancing of the Budget even in a normal year a precarious matter. It would appear from the financial crises which have overtaken the State since 19^0 that the Scale of Ruling Family and Military Expenditure ( the t7/o chief major heads ) decided upon at that time in the light of an artificial prosperity following the raising of a loan of six lakhs, is slightly in advance of the capacity of the State to 'bear in a normal year. Tha 5 scale of expenditure has no?/ come to he regarded as irreducible, though in a lean year it is relatively excessive, ihe alternative is to increase revenue: and to this end the two measures introduced during the past six months,namely (l) reorganisation of Shumailiyah z^a^at (llj establishment of three new customs posts should 'be supplemented in the second half of the year 'by (I) a Dhiw Registration tax (II) an attempt to take a proper share of customs) customs duties from Sur { this manifestly a thorny problem.) Notwithstanding these additional sources of revenue the State to should continue I opine ^eschew all proposals involving new expenditure♦ The economic factors making for a good revenue year are (1) good date crop in the Batinah &amp; Shumailiyah, (11) heavy rains in the interior, (111) failure of date crop of rival Basrah, (1Y) high world market prices of dates (Y) Prosperity of Dihai ( a considerable secondary market ) which arises from a good pearl harvest there, and this in turn depends upon the Paris pearl market - a consideration not unconnected with the exchange value of the franc. When as in the past year there is a combination of circumstances in the reverse sense, Muscat revenues must inevitably suffer and steps 'be taken anticipatorily to ensure rigid economy. -v I i cO A.M.

This liability the State has regularly met,and if necessary can continue to meet until the loan is liquidated, as on this has is it will he lic^uidated^ in Decemher 1929. But the strain It imposes is ohTious (a) a very rigid and parsimonious financial control has to he , constantly exercised (h) there is no scope for the most insistent and elementary reforms such as for instance a Suh-Assistant Surgeon for the small po.s infested Batinah oror for Gwauur which supplies the State with a considera-ble portion cf its revenues and gets nothing in return. 'Xoday any reform whatsoever involving expenditure must he eschewed, and under present arrangements,relief will come only in two and a half years» Lii most compelling need of the State,as envisaged hy the Oouncil of iaisters and hy the leading notables is a PriiLar^ School for Muscat.

This proposal,vide para 1,is that instead of five six monthly instalments of lis. 46740-5,seven six montlily instalments of Es.53585-15 may he substituted.The slight concession involved of a year's interest on two stiiall xinal instalments would he of great assistance, alt' ough if nono r amiss ion of such interest can 'be allowed, it is requested tue present 'balance plus interest may he spread over the longer .period.

Muscat 1 s letter No. K/73, dated 24th August 1927. ■ 'dzS 1 A J A loan of 5-g- lakhs was sanctioned in 1918. In 1919 an increase of the capital sun to 6tr lakhs was proposed. 1 n seeking the approval of the Secy, . of State the Govt, of India stated that the entire loan would be extinguished in 10 years (i.e. on 1st December 1929). &amp;ffsnrou*&lt;L The Secy, of State iiwfpwppfi of the increase? on the terms suggested. In 1920 the P.A., Muscat, suggested that the loan should be repaid by half- -yearly instalments of Es. 43,690/-, comm- -cncing from 1st December 1920. As the adoption of this suggestion would have resulted in the liquidation of the loan in 10-^ years instead of 10, the Govt, of India ordered that the loan should be repaid in 19 equated half-yearly payment of Es. 46,740-5-0 commencing on the 1st December 1920 (which would extinguish the loan on 1st December 1929. Payments under this arrangement have regularly been made up to date. The effect of the present proposal would be to extend by one year the period of 10 years fixed for the liquidation of the loan. As stated in the concluding paragraph of the Finance Minister's letter, the State would be grateful if let off the additional year's interest on the two (reduced) final instalments, but is prepared to pay it if called upon to do so.In connection with the object of the request - the establishment of a Primary School at Muscat - I would invite attention to the Political Agent, Muscat 's, letter to the Sultan,No. 1972, dated 16th December 1918, regarding the conditions on which the original loan was made available. The establishment of schools is mentioned therein as one of the reforms urgently called for. LUfcJ- /rr /9X7/^ ** In li, f.l X/j 3J /8 l-Vt /y n Secy.

Sir, In continuation of the correspondence ending with y^ur letter Ho. 1392-ri«A«, dated the 15th Beptemher 1920, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter No.K/73, dated the 21st August 1927, from the Political Agent, ...uscat, with enclosures, on the subject of the extension of the period of repayment of the loan made 'by us to the lluscat Government. The loan originally given to the State amounted to Bs.6,501000 to which was added an aiuount calculated at interest at 6% over 7 years, viz Es. 2,58,065-15-0, making a total of 1^.8,88,065 -15 -0. This amount was then divided into 14 six montly payments of j R s .46,740-5-0 - the whole to he paid off in the 7 years above mentioned. The Muscat State has now repaid Bs.6, 54,364-6-0, a total slightly in excess of the original loan,, thus the balance still due, Ss. 2,337-1-9, may 'be taken as represent ing the interest which has 'been incurred. The State now inform us that they can continue to pay the instalments in the manner stipulated hut they urge the point that so 4^ fa y &amp; 'A' Iletigay a payment handicaps the State very considerably in the provision of the improvements which any properly managed state should show in the way of schools etc. They have then asked that in place of paying off thesuia due in 2i years as now required they should 'be granted an additional year of grace, and that the period should he extended to 3i years. The presence or a British adviser in the State connects us with the outward want of pr^Si^ss which exists and few people would stop to consider that we have put the finances of the Estate on a sound 'basis. The time over ich the payment of the interest is spread is a matter of comparative indifference to us since we continue to receive our interest on the money expended. I think it is time that Muscat should show very distinct signs of our assistance in putting her finances in order. I would then recommend that the payment now due should he spread, not over a period of years as reauested, hut over a period of 5 years. This would reduce the annual payment of Es. 93,480-10-0 per annum, undoubtedly a strain on a btate with a total income of Bs.10,60,000, especially taking into consideration the heavy fall in the value of the Dollar. My suggestion would make the annual payment to Ks.46,740-5-0 an amount which could he paid without difficulty and it would leave half a lakh of rupees per annum for the public works, schools, etc., which are so much required. I would, at the same time, ask whether the financial authorities would not consider the question of a reduction in the rate of interest. The loan was made at a time of considerable financial stringency in the world at large, and the 6% agreed upon was a generous rate. Would it not he possible to-day to consider a reduction to 5^ ? We have nov 3 no desire to make more than a Bank rate out of an im poverished 3tate. I have the honour to 'be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant, Lieut.Colonel, Political Besident in the Persian gulf.^ ^ crt CONFir- 1 ^?Ii\L . lio. 41b-B. of 1927.
