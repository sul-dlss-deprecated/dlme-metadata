As regards Shereef, War Committee has decided not to send British Brigade to Habegh, nor can British troops be sent to you to relieve Soudanese troops for Shereef. In fact except as regards munitions and supplies which we will continue to send as far as other; calls permit, Shereef must rely on his own resources with such assistance as you can give him in the shape of Mahommedan personnel raised and trained either in, Hedjaz or in Soudan by such Mahommedan instructors. you can find* We hope before long to keep the lurks busy on the Eastern Egyptian Frontier and now that Raj has been successfully completed there does not . appear to be any immediate danger of collanse of' Murray has sent me copy of your letter to him of Shereefo[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use/ Cypher telegram to Sir hJvicMahon (Cairo).

Omit words 'now on the way from Algiers and' 9th sentence. For words 'upon Mecca' substitute 'from Medina'. After words 'Turkish communications' sentence should read 're-inforcements of Turkish force r.t Medina will prove increasingly difficult and ultimately it is hoped impossible owing to British operations now in progress north of Hedjaz'.

Moreover notwithstanding willingness of Shereef and his sons to see European troops landed at Rabegh recent attitude of local Arabs towards landing of (?a few)(few) British Officers to examine camping ground of our force has not been cordialr I therefore an still of opinion that we should postpone despatch even of aeroplanes and escort until more pressing need arises.

Arab revolt hollowing are our objections to despatch of Muslim troops under British ofhcers to Rabegh : — (1) When known this action would certainly cause general Muslim resentment in India, and be construed as deliberate breach of our pronouncement regarding Holy Places. (l) If Aghamstan situation deteriorates it might be used by war party as lever to force Amir into war. J (3; Once we despatch troops to Hedjaz we are bound to see Sherif through to the end. Failure or even serious reverse thereafter would mean hopeless loss of prestige and possibly creation of very serious situation— particularly on frontier. (4) Sherif himself would be discredited in Muslim eyes and never prove acceptable as Khalif if his success were due to arms of Christian power operating in Iledjaz. (5) We believe collapse of the Sherif ivould be less prejudicial to us in India than military intervention in the Hedjaz. For these reasons we are averse from proposal to despatch troops. At the same time we have Indian Muslims well in hand, and are assured of Amir’s personal desire to maintain neutrality, and if His Majesty’s Government still prefer to take risk of despatching troops, we must accept their policy.In any further communication •on the subject, please quote .La-^g ^ V/.204128/16.

No.844 Your telegram No.787 I much regret decision arrived at for strong reason that proposed arrangement has already been given full trial and found quite impracticable. In agreement with Commander-in-Chief 3irdar at my request undertook last June control and supervision of military arrangements for assistance of Shereef. Arrangement after some weeks had to be abandoned, much to the relief of the lapping and confusion without any compensating advantage. Circumstances necessitate provision of assistance in the ma.tter of stores, supplies and arms and ammunition and other material from here. Centre of Military Intelligence, Arab Bureau, and in case of stores etc which have to be purchased financial control all here. Naval Commander-in-Chief is in close touch with Commander-in- Chief Egypt and myself and cannot under any circumstances be so with the Sirdar at Khartoum. Naval arrangements in the Red Sea must moreover conform to requirements of military operations in or from Egypt. Coming operations for assistance of the Shereef North of Hedjaz render it desirable that our military arrangements in Hedjaz should be under one and the same control. Entrance of French military elements on to the scene again Sirdar and myself as it led to endless correspondence, over-makes it desirable that centre of military control should be here and not Khartoum. Political and military aspects of the question are so intermixed that there must be every facility for rapid personal interchange of views between those responsible. Arab question has necessitated daily communication between Commander-in-Chief, Uaval Commander-in-Chief and myself which is further facilitated by telephonic connection but notwith standing this situation also frequently demands personal meetings between each and all of us. I trust therefore that decision may be reconsidered or at least held in abeyance pending the views of Sirdar whom I am consulting.

The Director of Military Operations presents his compliments to the Under Secretary of State for ioreign Affairs, and, with reference to telegram No: 880 dated the 11th October, from Sir H. McMahon, is directed by the Chief of the imperial General Staff to call Lord Hardinge’s attention to the statement that the shereef has asked that British troops shall be held in readiness for despatch to Rabegh if necessary, and that the principle that British troops will be sent in case of necessity has been approved. General Sir William Robertson suggests that Sir H* McMahon should be informed that these views are conticir) to the decision of the War Committee, at the meeting of October 3rd (Y/.C.72, Conclusion 6), that only a flight of aeroplanes and such guns as might eventually be availaole should be sent. He further suggests that Sir H. McMahon should be directed to make it quite clear that there is no intention of sending a brigade to Rabegh, either of British or of Soudanese troops. 13th October, 1916.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Offlee -when-done with nniess required for official use.] ' Rabegh.

It will be noticed that the letter recognizes the temporary nature of the monthly payment now made to the Sherif. In regard to the objects for which it is given and the present manner of expenditure, I have thought fit to send the Sherif a verbal hint that he should endeavour to counteract the influence of Turkish gold among the Arab tribes by more generous payments on his own part. His sons Faisal and Ali think more might be done in this manner than hitherto. The reference to future monetary compensation for our occupation of Basrah and Iraq needs no further comment at the present moment. Our failure to attack the railway line North of Hedjaz is a matter to which the Sherif is con stantly calling my attention and I shall be glad when I can be in a position to tell him that action is actually being taken. The question is still under the consideration of the Military Authorities. The big guns, which the Sherif mentions as having Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K.G., etc. etc. etc.m - 2 - having been found too heavy for the bad Hedjaz roads, were a battery of howitzers which were sent merely to satisfy his urgent request; and referred to in my despatch No. 176, Secret, of July 25 th. Since the despatch of this letter much additional assistance in guns, rifles and ammunition etc., has been sent to the Sherif; and I shall forward to Your Lordship at an early date a complete list of all material of this sort which we have so far sent to the Hedjaz. I have sent a copy of this despatch, with the Sherif's letter, to the Viceroy and Governor General of India. I have, etc., (Signed) A. Henry McMahon.Copy of letter from His Highness the Sherif and Amir of Mecca to His Excellency The High Commissioner, dated 25 th August,1916 His Excellency the eminent vizier and His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Egypt, In addition to my telegram dated 21 st instant which was very short I am sending you this note as an appendix to it. My dear Friend, You have stated in your letter of the 26th July which contained the advice concerning the comfort of the Pilgrims and the security of the roads that Great Britain had granted us her great temporary monthly gift which amounts to £125000 for the above great purpose. Consequently, 0 dear and honourable friend, I am powerless to thank you for such generosity and care, although Great Britain is accustomed to such noble acts, worthy of her world renowned merit. Neverthe less I am proud to inform Your Excellency that the attainment of convenience and comfort for all sorts of visitors of God’s House and the Kaaba does not, by the grace of God depend upon the above mentioned temporary payments, of which I have now got £ 215,000 untouched (besides the £ 45,000 which were spent during the last 40 days as salaries and requirements for the Arabs and the tribes near Medina and for those whom we want to attract towards us;) This has resulted up till now in the resistance of our troops which were armed with rifles only (given by your help and endeavour) and they were able to face the two Divisions sent from Syria and Medina, armed with all kinus of modern arms. To-day also we handed the interpreter of His Excellency the British Agent in Jeddah £10,000 to take to Yanbo withwith the troops for the troops which are going to be sent from there (Yanbo) and to hand the money to him who should receive it. Your Excellency knows that the above mentioned monthly pay of £ 125,000 is for the organisation of Government and its necessary administrations, and will be deducted from the amount which we left to the justice of Great Britain to decide for our deficient Government which is under Great Britain's guardianship and protection during her occupation of Basra and Iraq. But here are the consequences which undoubtedly resulted from forgetfulness and which are clearly apparent to the present moment: the failure to attack the Railway, the benefit of which would be mutual, and which was one of our decisions and also the sending to us of the big guns which cannot be taken through the bad roads of our Country to the necessary spots. All such things lead to the prolongation of the period of the fighting against the Turks and their advance about a day's distance from Medina, whereas we were sure according to our plans that our fighting would by now be in the vicinity of Damascus. All this has cost us much unexpected expenditure and labour and finally we have been compelled to organise a force to send to the neighbourhood of Rabegh to face whatever may befall Yet I repeat my request to you to send a Warship with an aeroplane or seaplane to Rabegh and another ship with a flying machine to Yanbo with the consignment of rifles demanded by telegraph as soon as possible. Please accept my best compliments and honour to Your Excellency. (Signed) The Sherif and Amir of Mecca.

In ^gypt itself present force would sufuce in. no further diminution, but each one of political results mentioned would involve pressing demands for additional troops elsewhere, supply of which night primarily fall \ on Egypt. Hence Commander in Chief's estimate of tnree | divisions might oven prove too moderate.

Following are our objections to dispatch of Muslim troops under British Officers to Rabegh* ^ (1) . \Vhen known this action would certainly cause general Muslim resentment in India and be construed as deliberatebreach of our pronouncament regarding Holy Places. (2) . If Afghanistan situation deteriorates it might be used by War party as lever to force Amir into war. (3) * Once we despatch troops to Hedjaz we are bound to see Sherif through to the end. Failure or even serious reverse thereafter would mean hopeless loss of prestige and possibly creation of very serious situation ~ particularly on frontier* (4) . Sherif himself would be discredited in Muslim eyes and never prove (?) acceptable as Khalif if his success were due to arms of Christian power operating in Hedjaz* (5) . Y/e believe collapse of the Sherif would be less prejudicial to us in India than military intervention in the Hedjaz. For these reasons we are averse from proposal to despatch troops. At the same time we have Indian Muslim s well in hand and are assured of Amir T s personal desire to maintain neutrality and if His Majesty T s Government still prefer to take risk of despatching troops we must accept their policy.OTBRATIOJ© SECBi T.

All , Aziz, A1 Masri and Nuri had a long conference this morning on H.M.S. 'Dufferin” and arrived at following decision. Ali remains at Kabegh with at least 5,000 men. Thissal moves to-day to Al Makshush about ten kilo metres from coast half way between here and Yenbo: he will have about 4,000 Arabs with Egyptian artillery consisting of four mountain guns and four Maxims (two of the latter German brought by H.M.S. ,L Dufferin'). Three thousand Arabs are at Kaif and along Turkish communications to Bir Darwish which they are to harry as much as possible. If Turks descend by Sultaneh road Faisal is to allow them to get well on the road to Habegh and soutn of his position and following them- will attack them from the rear when they develop, attack on Ali here. I went over whole question with Aziz Al Masri and he asks for following to be supplied as soon as possible. Three quick-firing mountain batteries complete to be carried on camels or mules if latter mules must be sent; Nuri states that he has necessarynecessary personnel but I surest British artillery officer he sent to show working if necessary. Aziz and Ali think Turks mean to come to Rahegh eventually, and latest messenger states that enemy advance logins to-morrow, Beptemher 23rd, but intelligence of v~is sort is insufficiently strong and will be impossible to verify ; so that all that I can recommend is that brigade and necessary transports be reId in readiness at 8uez to leave at once at shortest possible notice. I arrive at Jeddah September 84th with Aziz who goes to Taif to try a)id get a move on there'. From other information leceived it appears that Turks did not get further along the Sultaneh road than Bir-Abbas, 50 miles from Medina. They then retired 18 miles to Raha tut subsequently on the failure of water supply there again advanced to Bir-Abbas Wady where they were still reported to be on September 20th. It was also reported that they had not suffi cient transport for serious advance, were short of provisions and had many deserters. Situation therefore as far as can be judged from somewhat conflicting information appears more favourable especially as surrender of Turkish garrison at Taif now frees Arab force under Shereef's son Abdullah for service elsewhere, Aziz Al Masri has recently joined Shereef from Sgypt and been appointed Qommander in Ghief of Shereef 1 s forces.

Major-General Stewart, Poiibical Resident, Aden. A,*C. We have received your esteemed letter dated Ijth Shawal 1334 (l4th August 1916 ) and we have understood what your Honour has alluded to, concerning the Kunfida affairs. We would li&amp;e that you should know the inner mean ing of the case and hope that you have known for certain the pleasure we felt in the action taken by Sherif Husen* the Amir of Mecca, because we regard him as the best of friends and the old enmity that existed is considered as an incident of the past and as actuated by the Turks* We had a hope that his (Sheriff) ideas and action would har monise^ with ours, as through his medium, co-operation is possible against the enemy especially when the enemy is powerful and has strong supporters and allies* We long to have all the people with us in this matter. Re the question of the port of Kunfida,although our claim to it is a substantial one, the temporary sur render of it to the Sherif, would not be harmful to us,had the action on his and our part been a joint one, so as to ensure our overcoming the whole district and arr matters such as the mobilisation of troops* We have more experience of this part of the country and are more ac quainted with the personnel good and bad* Tnose who are afar off and beyond the reach of the Turks are ^entirely our own meji. The evilly disposed people are in their favor while the good are devoted to us* Our deputies and repre sentatives are in every direction. When your ships arrivedand bombarded Kunfida and the Turks had to capitulate, the well disposed people rejoiced and so helped us as to prevent the Turks and their adherents from resistance, hence they were obliged to surrender* It is a matter of regret therefore that when the Turkish partisans have seen the Turkish downfall and noted our charge and control and realized we would not only force them to behave properly but also enlist them as soldiers to fight the Turks and their supporters in their near vicinity (as was done 5 years ago), they to»k refuge with the Sherif of Mecca thus settling up in trigues useful solely to the Turks. Th® Sherif will be content that these peoplv have simply surCrendered and it is not in his power to force them to take further action. Consequently the Turks -will gain shelter, and no forces from M*cea to Asir are likely to come. Even if such ^forces were available, the people of Asir who are powerful will not^affected by them. They have strongly fortified hills. It is a mat “ er for wonder that such a stratagem should have appealed to the Sherif of Mecca, for he has actually assisted the partisans of the Turks and has asked that the people on whom reliance could be placed, as also ourselves, who have never befriended the Turks, should stop our oper ations. What is more curious is the su pport given to him (the Sherif) by British officers in this matter, so much so that the ship at Ai Kunfida, in order to propi tiate the confederates of the Turks in the name of ohe , sherif, threatened the removal of our people under hu- * miliating tenns notwithstanding that these were posted at Kunfida by Government. The friendship of these people with us and th. Government has resulted in ■’ J ' ' on i,pa,.e and the difficulties arising th.r.fro. ». summarised as follows: ( 1 )(l) The tribesmen will not hereafter have confidence in us nor in the acts of the British Government. ( 2 ) (3) (4) (5) ( 6 ) (7) ( 8 ) On the liberation of the Turkish party from our control, they have become powerful and are working in the interest of the Turks. As a result they have actually removed the remainder of the soldiers of Kunfida, who with their guns and equipments were in open places, to Mohail, which owing to their fear of us, they could not venture to do before. Our friendlies on seeing the success of the pro- Turks, will have an ardent desire to jpin them* The Turks at Abha and Mohail have nothing to fear from any^of fighting men from Kunfida,Tihama (low land) and hills. We had already organised armies from these men in the year when we besieged Abha. The soldiers who proceeded from us were able to draw them to a fight, because they are natives of the place and are better acquainted with its ways. The country of^Sir belongs to us and if we are cut,#* off from it, we shall have no supporters left there. Our preparations for defence and our preliminary measures made in the event of the Turks* return,are thereby rendered fruitless. The blockade against Abha and its dependencies is removed, because the opening of Kunfida for trade, is tantamount to allowing goods to reach the interior which is enemy country. All the work done by our posts, such as the inter- ru'ption of communication between the South and Asir will hav® been in vain. Had it not been for this, the Sherif of Mecca would have had no success in his present undertaking. The Turks had mad® all necessary preparations at Mecca, but they were afraid of the day when troubles might arise from the South and Asir, and so they had also made preparations to meet such eventuality* The action was started at Mecca and our posts intervened between thejrf Turks and Sherxf* The Sherif therefore was able to attain his object through us. This is our explanation of the circumstan«&lt; cas.

They then tried to get reinforcements frm Kbha but failed -- owing to our troene based on Birk and that district, '^hey then determined to make overtures to the Sherif knowing that he could net control the tribes to enable him to attack Kbha and Muhall and that the result would necessarily result in inaction and relief for the Turks. They would also urgs the Bherlf to secure the release of the hostages held by me, so that should hostilities against the Turks occur, there would be nothing to prevent them giving the Turks their full assistance. They would then help the Turks to victory taking no account of ths Oherlf. This is the first tlms the tfterif has ever fought independently, and therfore he has not the t h experience to understand wither affairs are leading. (5) The aheikhs whe are now holding hunfida are the most influ* ecitial Sheikhs of Mali and the Kunfida district and it is thsss she loyally fought for us against the Turks a years age. Jhen they saw your ships they rejoiced and opposed the Turkish sheikh* and controlled Kunfida, commanding their tribes and the tribes of the district to hslp us and you in the conviction that by yeur help the traces of the Turks would be obliterated. It is a matter of regret that the intriguee ef the Turkish sheikhs with the Uherif have been successful and ths loyal tribes art exposed to disappointment. (6) be have never heard of any state ^dilah was in friendly relations with each ether interfering in her internal affaire or intriguing with her people on «ny pretext Caterer. (?) Hot only is Kunfida part sf Asir, but was handed over to ns by a great power. The news sf that spread threu^out -ill tn? tribes and through every district. It ie hecesearlly impossible for me to sutmit to the disgrace ahich would result from this proposal, especially since our hands are tied since this decision nas been reached by the power which we reckon as our greatest friend*03 (d) { iti* trib«# AftSr *?• «hi«h Marmot bn an tar ad althar l&gt;y tna ^artf ar by aa «xc«r?t *ith thair conaant, ^afara tiia Tur kish arm thay urara iUnga of tha Yanan and «Xs* wars Kinya of tha uadjms untU ax^adltion of Fshamed All Pnsha a^mlnst tha Wmhm- hla* Tuay hare prored that thay *r% loyal to ua rather than to any one else, and no on# except the fHands of the Turks will deny that Aden they find three mare In their country, tha Bharlf, tha Turk, and my self.

I 1 liave the hononr to forward, with reference to my telegram No. 107 ^ of 3rd January 1910, an interesting report of Lieutenant-Colonel 11 . h. Jacob, first Assistant Kesident, on Ids visit, as my representative, to the Idnsi. I have forwarded copies of the report and of this letter direct to foreign Department, Delhi, His Britannic Majesty’s High Commissioner, Cairo, and His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. The Idrisi welcomed Lieutenant-( olonel Jacob and the officers who accompanied him most coidialh, and I am confident that the mission and the reciprocation of views will bear good results. 1 he clauses of our Trade Policy were fully discussed seriatim. I am glad to say that the Idrisi is in accord with the terms of the policy, which are given in the accompanying Schedule. I trust they will meet with approval. •&gt;. 1 was desirous of the question of trade between Idrisi ports and Jeddah being discussed, in which connection the Southern Led Sea Patrol has experienced some difficulty in controlling dhow traffic. The reasons being that while our Policy prohibits dhows plying between ports in this Administration and ports on the Southern Red Sea coast line, and while control has been assured over such traffic from Somaliland, French, and Italian ports, yet it does not interfere with dhows from ports in the Northern Red Sea area, including Jeddah, trading with Idrisi ports, and under which pretence there is little doubt they run their goods into enemy ports. It was known, also, that the Idrisi was embarrassed by this exemption, a&gt; facilities were afforded to his own dhows to smuggle goods into enemy ports lying towards Jeddah. This question was discussed, therefore, and it is noticed that the Idrisi appreciates the advantages, generally, of prohibiting this trade, ft would seem that his apparent objection to its cessation is based on material grounds, affecting the interests of his people in depriving them of a source of cheaper grain. In ihe circumstances it is advisable (o drop the matter. 4. The export of kerosine oil to Medi has been engaging my attention for some time. We have reduced consignments from Aden to within reasonable limits. The French and Italian authorities have met my representations and requests on this matter in a cordial spirit. I have addressed, also, the High Commissioner, Egypt, in connection with this export trade from ports in the Northern Red Sea area. 5. I am not in favour, at present, of exempting any of the enemy ports from the restrictions imposed by the trade Policy. We have experienced some disappointment already in this respect. From all information 1 have received the Arabs lay all the blame for their troubles upon the Turks and S. 298. A9 • not upon the British. It is well to foster this teelin'. It is fairly certain, also, that the Turks will reap the benefit of such exemptions especially at Hodekla. Moreover, by exempting certain ports, blockade-running activities would start afresh, and as a natural consequence the labours of the Southern Patrol would increase south of the Idrisi coast line where dhow trading is now well under control. 6 . The Idrisi’s request to assist one Saiyid Ahmed al Bahr of Huseniya will receive consideration. It should have a good effect to accede to it. Ilis desire for the presence of Saiyid Mustafa has been cabled to the High Commissioner, Egypt. 7. Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob recommends a decoration of Knighthood to be bestowed by Government on the Idrisi. Personally 1 think the honour now would be premature. 8 . The Idrisi's favourable comments on Commander (Taufurd R.X., will be communicated to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, Egypt, through the Senior Naval Officer, Aden. 0. f am indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob for the ability and tact with which he has conducted the Mission.

I was accompanied by Colonel Wanhope, C.P., C.M.G., C.I.K.. Ihl-; whosonolit topographical information, and Major Jlradshaw,’(denerai Mall Omcer, who came to discover the military situation The Political Pesident’s letter of introduction was taken ashore, and later in the day Muhammad bin Saliva Pa ^ahi, the idrisi s Wazir, came alioard to give us welcome and to tender sheep and fowls as a present from the Idrisi. lie rvaid his mastei would see us alter dark and on shore. I found that this manooin 10 was due to the idrisi s desire to disarm his people’s prejudice against the loreigner. 1 remarked that the whole countryside knew of the tieaty between the Idrisi and Pritish Government and the close nexus and friendship existing and proved by the monopoly given to the Idrisi qua opening of his ports alone to traffic from Aden, Djibouti, Massawa, and A sal). It is a commonplace that this preferential treatment has greatly enhanced the Idrisi s prestige and importance in the Arab world. Earlier in the war certain ol the Idrisi s tribesmen, it is said, were averse to his light ing the 1’nrks, and although now the Turk has fallen in Arab estima tion, the Idrisi thought it better not to deal too openly with non-Moslems lest the old feeling Jor the lurks should be re-aw r akened. Again, the vole of the Idrisi is a priestly one and too great a familiarity with us might be misinterpreted. To tell the truth, the Idrisi feared loss of caste. It is a fact, how T ever, that during his pact wdth Italy, no Italian officers were allowed to land on Idrisi soil, and before our arrival at .1 ezan, the only privileged person to land had been Commander Craufurd of If.M.S. Minto on two occasions. For the same reasons the Jdrisi would not board the Miuto. Vt e got ashore after b.-U) p.m., w hen two or three officials met us and conducted us to a house hard by, where upstairs in an anteroom the Idrisi met us standing, and after salutations conducted us to an inner room where, himself seated on a couch, he gave us places on chairs each side. (The party included Commander Craufurd, R.N., who was there to watch naval interests). His Wazir, Ihn Sahi, w^as in attendance. This Minister will not allow his master to discuss matters except in Ids presence. 1 have known Ha Sahi for several years, and have met him often in Aden. My impression is that the Idrisi depends on his advice and judgment. The Idrisi himself told me that all maritime and shipping affairs \vere in Ba Sahi’s hands; that he himself managed affairs inland. All through the interview', wdiich lasted three hours, the Idrisi constantly turned to his Minister to seek corroboration of his views, and on many a subject broached he would say “ For this, please deal with Ha Sahi.” I had an opportunity after the interview to talk a few minutes alone with the Idrisi. 1 asked him if Ha Sahi were not serving his own interests rather than his master’s. He replied rather dubiously and asked if I had any suspicion. Me asserted that Ha Sahi was a good man. I quoted the tradition “ Al Mustashar Mu’taman,” i.e., “It is incumbent to trust one whose advice you seek.” The Idrisi felt relieved and said these were his sentiments, f shall touch on Ha Sahi again later. Southcni Red Sea Pal rot Policy .—I discussed the revised Red Sea pat rol policy of 7th December 1014. The Idrisi asked that Khor al Birik (and not Has Turfa) be regarded as the northern limit of his coastal area for trade and Habl as the southerly point, though he claims that his territory extends from Hah Point to Buhes, a little south of Habl. The trade between ports in this area he considers a most valuable asset to secure the goodwill of his maritime subjects. He was confident that no supplies could reachthe Turks from anv of his ports, though he recognised the possibility of smuggling goods to‘places on shore between his pons and asked for a closer naval patrol to check it. \s for the possibility of the k a rasa n group being a hiding giound foi Turkish dhows and specie-running, the idrisi said this was not likely. These islands were frequented by his pearl fishing boats only. Trade with Jeddah.—\ touched on Jeddah trade and pointed out how easv it was for enemy dhows to run the blockade and put jh oi tonic at such daimerous places as Konfidha and lath. This he replied was the role of naval vigilance to detect. He said he did not send dhows to Jeddah, for he himself feared his men might improve the occasion to trade with enemy ports. As for trade from Jeddah, it certainly took place. These dhows brought grain. I said that we would supply him from Aden to a greater extenf than at present, which in accordance with his request was up to 1,500 ba°s per mensem, lie said he could not stop tins trade liom Jeddah, but thought we might do so if we could: at the same time such restrictions would be unpalatable to his people since Jeddah grain sold cheaper in his ports than that supplied from Aden ! v i&gt; —Personally 1 think it impolitic to stop this Jeddah trade because (1) It is highly politic not to break the link between Jeddah and Idrisi ports which has an important and a potentially political value. ( 2 ) Jeddah is open to India, Soudan, Ac., and to close it to Idrisi would very properly engender suspicion. (o) Jeddah is sacrosanct and a so-called neutral port. (4) Jeddah is pre-eminently Arab and our policy has been to exclude Arabs as the butt of our hostilities. ( 5 ) Such policy will enhance prices and this will be unpoptdar to our new friends. The one object achieved by detaching Jeddah would be the extra facility given to the naval patrols who are watching the coast. 1 his advantage can be discounted in view of the many disadvantages of closing Jeddah to the Idrisi. Idrisi and l^orcuju Trade :—trade from Djibouti, Alassawa and Asab comes now in dhows via Kamaran to Meidi. I he question of return trade to these ports was touched upon at the interview. Such trade is inevitable, though not broached in the revised policy. The Idrisi, in a recent letter to his Aden Agent, said he would ask the Political Resident of Aden to reconsider the question of reopening the dhow traffic between his ports and Aden. He did not touch on this subject before me and 1 thought it unwise to mention it. The Idrisi clearly saw at the interview that the less trade there was by dhows passing along an enemy coast the better, and I do not think he will bring up the question of dhow trade with Aden unless forced by Ba Sabi A Co. In this circumstance, 1 think it wise to acquiesce in the return trade by these dhows from Meidi to the three above-mentioned foreign ports of the African coast more especially that the Idrisi remarked that many of the Arab importers of Aleidi and Jezan were Italian subjects of Massawa and Asab. This trade from the foreign parts of African side largely increases our naval patrol s vigilance. We cannot, however, stop it without offending our French and Italian friends, who already have met the Resident’s wishes by con siderably cutting down the flow of kerosine oil and also by limiting the number of dhows plying per mensem. In my opinion, if I may digress a moment, this question of restricted food supplies, while it has enhanced enormously the Id risks reputation—a no inconsiderable asset to us—lias by this very fact of an acquired monopoly added to the Idrisi’s embarrassment and responsi bility. I am sure he values the distinction conferred on his ports, but he must at times feel that he is suspected of passing on supplies, which, though destined I believe for Arab friends, must lind their way partly into 1 urkish camps. It is only, however, partly so, for, as the Idrisi told me, the vast supplies lhat are going to Aleidi, and have raised Meidi to the status of a large town.x V &lt;v r 5 aiv used by him to eom iliate both his own outlying tribesnum, with main- ol whom the Imam has long been tampering, anil also tribes of reputed iHMitrality outside the province of Asir. Kcrostnc Oil. I his applies in a large measure to the supplies of kerosine oil, a commodity which, if meant solely for the hlrisi tribesmen’s particular use, IS being shipped to Meidi far in excess ol local requirements. It has been said that Arabs do not use this oil, but this is quite erroneous. Keen if the supplies imported into Meidi do in part iind a Turkish militai v mai kft the I urks are not in such great numbers to derive a marked advantage. The [mam’s country supplies a large quota of supplies to the Lurkish Arabs arrayed against the Idrisi forces in the neighbourhood of Lohaiya. I o cdirry out mr original policy of favouring the Arab to wean him fiom the I urk, 11 might not he unsound to allow the supply of goods to many a port, which though styled enemy is really peopled by Arabs who loathe the I urks. •liodeida especially is in a very bad way and manv Arabs have died then* of starvation. In this \\a\ tiade would he stimulated, Arabia pleased, rhe British name popularised, as it was when Jeddah and Mecca were freely supplied, in spite ol I urkish forces present in the Hejaz. Again, the w’ork of the Southern A.aval patrol would be made lighter and the ships would pay attention rather to the shipping ol arms, ammunition, and specie. Relative to the importance of separating Arab from Turk the Idrisi a-Ted if we would allow an occasional dhow to go from Aden or from Meidi to A1 Tail'(a Zeranik port) with supplies from one Saiyid Ahmed al Bahr, an influential man living inland at Ifuseniya. The Zeranik, he said, were largely pro-Turk but favour shown to so prominent a Saiyid would he far- reaching. 41 What von sow to-dav, von will to-morrow reap,” he said. Tin s is another instance of the Idrisi’s plan of reconciling the Arabs. I'orl Gleam)ice* to Idrisi Ohoirs. With regard to the issue by him of Port Clearances to his dhows the Idrisi was in lull agreement. 1 explained to him the details these papers should show and emphasized the importance of a Hag-paper to he carried by every dhow flying Ids flag. He has given me a drawing and wants a seal made for him. Supplies to Tnrhs. The Idrisi assured me that no supplies were sent through his country to the Turks. Kunfidha, he admitted, was the port selected by the enemy, and from there they went to Abba, the capital of Asir, where the Turks were stationed. Kunfidha, Lohaiya and Khoba were the ports the Naval patrols should especially watch. Firing on II. \I.S. Lanka's Boats.— L spoke to him of the two affairs a little south of Jezun where the Lanka chased dhows carrying specie, tin* crew landing and firing on the warship’s beats. The Idrisi referred me to Ba Sabi, but remarked that the coastline between his ports was not safe, and a good deal of smuggling was done there by enemy craft. The Idrisi had arrested Said Musa’id the Sheikh of Al ilabl, on suspicion of corre sponding with the enemy at Hodeidah, hut after a time released him as nothing could be proved. IrJrisis animus against Lurks.- — 1 was very much impressed with Idrisi s animosity against the Turks which 1 am sure is genuine. He acknowledged a mission from Enver Has ha before the war, hut he could no longer trust Turkish promises or Turkish faith. At the beginning ol the war, when the Turks were brought into the arena, the Idrisi said that public opinion in Asir was in svmpathy with them as Moslems, but now the aspect was changing. He, the Idrisi, was glad the Turks had espoused the German cause, for this had weakened Arab respect for Turkey, since the Germans were distrusted as lighting for purposes of self-aggrandisement; they were faithless and unscrupulous, and T urkey was blamed for throwing in her lot with them. He was confident the Allies would win in the long run, but seemed apprehensive lest a peace be concluded which would leave the T urks in possession of their present territories in Arabia. He asked about the Dardanelles especially, but recognised the strength opposite us there. S. 29S. B| 1 —r-^ mmm G Idrisi Militarif Movements .-—1 asked him what lie was actually doiim with the enemy in his immediate frontier. As regards Lohaiya he said he lacked guns to cope with the Turks and Arabs there. If he took Lohaiya—and ihe opposition of the Bani Jami tribe was a neglible quantity—he would become the target of a strong advance movement of ’Turks and Arabs aided by Imam Yahya. who he declared was actually aiding the Turks with supplies and men. lie urged me to get him ammunition for his guns and he gave Major Bradshaw some specimen shells which perhaps can be had from captures made in Egypt and Mesopotamia. The Idrisi was very pleased with Government’s generosity in presenting him so much rifle ammunition, but his inactivity on this front is due to lack of gun ammunition. The 'Turkish positions on this front are strongly fortified. The Idrisi remarked he was holding up the enemy here who otherwise would he at Lahej. Turkish Deserters. —Many Turkish deserters had come in from Asir and from Sanaa, and were loafing about Jezan and Meidi. Two of them a I urk and an Arab—he handed over to us for conduct to Aden. He showed us a box of dynamite, which he affirmed had been brought down to Jezan to destroy his house there, fdrisi’s treatment of deserters seemed lenient. 1 gathered this was due to Arab sentiment towards Moslems. I dr t si s Political Movements .—The Idrisi seemed politically very active in conciliating the tribesmen. He had just received a deputation of 200 Asir tribesmen in Jezan. He was treating with the people of Ghamid also. Hashid \\ a Bakih —The 1,000 rifles he requires from Djibouti he intends to give to his tribesmen llijal al Ma, who inhabit his northern limit. He was coquetting with the powerful tribes of Hashid wa Bakil, who I hear from other reliable sources are dissatisfied with the Imam’s meanness. The fdiisi said that if Go\cinment would assist these people pecuniarily thev would come down en masse against the Turks. It was purely a question of bribery. I interviewed in Aden some months ago an emissary of the Hashid tribe, who hinted that for a consideration they would willingly join the British! Any pourparlers with this tribe might be done through the medium of the Idrisi. [mam l ahya.— \ he Imam is a declared foe of the Idrisi ever since he joined the lurks before their war with Italy. Imam and Idrisi were once friendly in spite of differences of creed, and the Idrisi said he might again lie leconciled if Imam came half way to meet him. As to the Nejran province, the Idrisi said lie was negotiating with them too. hose people are of the Ismailiya persuasion and extremelv inimical to Imam l ally a, though friendly to Turks, who had espoused their cause m times gone by against the Imam. In short, the Idrisi’s work at the present moment is mostly diplomatic, and unless he gets gun ammunition 1 do not think he will be able to make any headway against Turks and Turkish Arabs. His prowess in the field is indisputable. 1 remember meeting in Damascus in 15)13 Suleman Pasha the local Commandant. lie was before that lighting the Idrisi in Asir, and he said he found him a difficult problem to solve. In fact he could not subdue him. Sl'enf of ileeat. Idrisi discussed the Sherif, and longed to know his attitude towards the Intish. lie affected to know nothing. He said he revered the Sherd, whose territories once comprised the idrisi domains, and he said he was m correspondence with the famous tribesmen of Bani lath II he knew the bherit s mind he would join forces with him, but eared to go up am hnd him openly aiding the Turks. He believed that the Client might be powerless just now to oppose the Turks, and was thetefoie forced to declare his friendship with them. The Bani Harb would, he saul be prime users rf ,he Me,linn railway were extended to Mecca, and i should be British policy to aid these people so as to make it possible for them actively to oppose the railway construction.,b&gt;)ms : sv‘.- 4 ~Tli(' Idrisi was anxious to know the Senussi’s altitude towards Great Britain, l ie believed they were hostile and he was surprised. &gt;aipid Mustafa. — lie asked me to write for the presence of Saiyid MustaJ.i ^hose ad\ice was of paramount importance to him. lie w r as now in Egypt: Idi'isi s I’ci'sou. Iii person the Idrisi is tall and broad and of black complexion. \ ery courteous and suave and Ins manners highly polished. He was particularly friendly to us and spoke highly of the British Govern ment and their attitude to the Moslem world, lie struck me as markedly intelligent, as is natural, looking to his upbringing and education at A1 A/bar. He is, as befitting his position as head of the Ahmediya larika, an intensely religious man, and spends much of his time in religious exercises. He moves about but little m the daytime and conducts most of his business at night. Sheikh of Jczan.-- The Sheikh of Jezan, one Bin Zamin, is a most agree able old man and very friendly to our warships when they call. Sheikh Muhammad Yehnja ]&gt;&lt;i Sahi. —1 have already said that all maritime and commercial matters are left to Ba Sahi. This is mentioned by Military Intelligence, Cairo, in Ids Secret telegram E.B. M27, dated 29th December 1915. Ills partner. Ba Zubeir, lives at Meidi, and these two control the flow of supplies in various directions. Ba Sahi is no lover of the Turks. 1 think his unique position and the estimation in which he is held by the Idrisi makes him a natural butt for the criticisms of the envious. We have long suspected Ba Sahi to be w'orking for his own private ends, and he is doubtless a wealthy man. It is not feasible to contrive his removal. Nothing has so far been proved of Ba Sahi’s nefarious acts. Honours to Idrisi. —I will sum up this already lengthy report by pressing the importance of assisting the Idrisi by every means possible, with guns and by largesse, to impress the tribesmen. I believe it to be a sound investment. 1 would further suggest he be decorated by Government with a Knighthood. This honour would encourage him and elicit better work. A religious title might, however, be more greatly esteemed. Commander Craufurd, /CN.— Finally, 1 would eulogise the excellent work, great tact and affability towards the Arabs displayed by ( ommandei Craufurd, B.X., who is very popular m those parts, and who with the Olficers of his Ship has been for so long a time in a trying climate and verv difficult waters. The Idrisi spoke highly of this Officer, the liist one privileged to land on Idrisi soil. 17th January 1910. If. F. Jacob, Lieutenant-Colonel. First Assistant Resident, Aden.No. C. S3. Policy for His Majesty's Ships in the Southern Pod Sen Patrol. A' Su All Southern Red Sea Arabian ports are closed for trade with the following exception, viz. : — (i). All goods carried from Aden, Perim, and Kamaran to Medi and cite versa which will be taken by Cowasjee, Pinshaw, and lb-others’ steamers and by no other means. (ib Goods from Djibouti, Massowah, and Assab in French and Italian dhows respectively will be carried between those ports and Medi and to none other Idrisi port. These dhows, however, will report to Port Officer, Kamaran, en route both ways to obtain special clearances. Any dhow found transgressing this order will be detained by naval patrols. (iii) Inter-trade between Idrisi ports lying between and including Khor al Rirk and I laid will be permitted in the Idrisi’s own dhows alone, and his Nakhudas will be furnished by Idrisi port officials with proper port clearances, flag, papers, and manifests. Failing this measure they will become liable to seizure. (iv) All ports lying between and inclusive of Khor al Birk and I laid will be open to dhow trade from the Northern Red Sea Patrol area inclusive of Jeddah. All such Idrisi ports will be allowed to trade by dhows with ports in the Northern Red Sea Patrol inclusive of Jeddah, but such dlmws must be furnished in the same manner, as in clause (iii), with proper port clearances, flag- papers, and manifests. Failure to comply with this measure will entail seizure. (v) Goods will be allowed to pass by dhows from Aden to Djibouti and Oboek, but only under special guarantee. G. If. U.

The War Committee discussed telegrams Nos. 740, 741, and 745 from the British High Commissioner for Egypt, more par ticularly from the point of view of the requirements of the Sherif of Mecca in personnel and material. The War Committee are not prepared to sanction the proposal of the Sirdar to send as many Moslem troops as he can spare safely from the Khartoum district and from Egypt, on condition that their place in the Sudan is taken by a brigade of British troops, as^ they understand that the General Staff do not consider this appropriation of British troops desirable. In regard to material, the Committee were informed that the War Office have heard from the Commander-in-chief in Egypt that a Conference is to take place at Ismailia on the 2nd September, between the High Commissioner, the Naval Commander-in-chief, the General Officer Commanding-in-chief, and Mr. Wilson from Jeddah, and that no decision is desired from home until after this Conference. It was agreed, however, that this Conference should be put m possession of all information regarding the extent to which the requirements of the Sherif can be met as regards guns machine- guns, rifles, and aeroplanes, and the Director of Military Operations undertook to notify this information to the Foreign Office for trans mission to the High Commissioner.

Extracts from the Proceedings of a Meeting of the U ar Committee, held on Friday, September 1, 1916, at 3 p.m. Greece 1 . A decision was asked for from the War Committee as to what reply should be sent to the proposal of the 1 rench Govern ment that an immediate demonstration should be made in support of the demands of the British and r rench Ministers for the expulsion from Greece of the German Baron Schenk ; for the seizure of enemy merchant ships at Salamis by the Anglo-1 rench naval forces , as well as for the control of the Greek posts, telegraphs, and wireless telegraph stations. In drawing the attention of the M ar Com mittee to these matters, Lord Crewe pointed out that there was now a good deal of evidence that opinion in Greece was veering towards the side of the Allies, in support of which he quoted Sir 1. Elliot s telegram No. 1242, dated the 30th August, reporting that General Moschopoulos, the new Chief of the Greek General Staff, considere that in a few days’ time we should see a pronounced movement m favour of military co-operation with the Entente Powers ; also his No. 1251, dated the 31st August, stating that he considered the despatch of a squadron to Salamis or Piraeus undesirable m present conditions; and further telegrams received to-day recording a strong movement in Greek Macedonia in favour of the ^ ies • . ,• It was agreed that the Foreign Office should send instructions to the British Minister in Athens in the following sense It is understood that the French Minister in Athens has been authorised to demand— (1.) That Baron Schenk and German agents should be expelled. (2.) That the enemy merchant ships at Salamis should be seize bv the Allied fleets. i * „ (3.) That the posts, telegraphs, and wireless telegraph stations ^ in Greece should be put under the control of the Allies. That it is most important that such proposals, it made at all, should be made in the name of the British and French Governments together; that the British Minister is therefore authorised to associate himse with his French colleague, unless the situation has so chanced as to render this action no longer necessary, m which case he should at once report to the Foreign Office. a • -i nnmmnnication to be made to Paris by the Foreign Office, andto the Vice-Admiral Commanding, Eastern Mediterranean, by the Admiralty.

The War Committee discussed telegrams Nos. 740, 741, and 745 from the British High Commissioner for Egypt, more par ticularly from the point of view of the requirements of the Sherif of Mecca in personnel and material. The War Committee are not prepared to sanction the proposal of the Sirdar to send as many Moslem troops as he can spare safely from the Khartoum district and from Egypt, on condition that their place in the Sudan is taken by a brigade of British troops, as they understand that the General Staff do not consider this appropriation of British troops desirable. In regard to material, the Committee were informed that the War Office have heard from the Commander-in-chief in Egypt that a Conference is to take place at Ismailia on the 2nd September, between the High Commissioner, the Naval Commander-in-chief, the General Officer Commanding-in-chief, and Mr. Wilson from Jeddah, and that no decision is desired from home until after this Conference. It was agreed, however, that this Conference should be put in possession of all information regarding the extent to which the requirements of the Sherif can be met as regards guns, machine- guns, rifles, and aeroplanes, and the Director of Military Operations undertook to notify this information to the Foreign Office for trans mission to the High Commissioner.

He states has position across (group undecypherable) Road most critical (it is undoubtedly serious) and has suggested Shereef that he should take all his Arabs to Mecca if assistance is not sent him. He lays particular stress on viual import ance of having about 3,000 trained soldiers se.m him; even if they remain at Yeribo they would show Arabs goodwill of Great Britain was helping them, put heart into them and give Faisal a sense of security. He also asks for two Aeroplanes which would have greater effect on the Arabs Who are getting disheartened at not receiving support they expected and numerous tribes remain in pay of Turks until they see Great Britain really means to help Arabs. propose to break through to Rabej where Sheikh has retained practically all supplies previously lande.a ror Faisal sending him only a few rifles which he had previously damaged ard a small amount of food stuffs, With Faxsal's ■rcS 1 s; concurrence » ’ ' * - * \concurrence I will endeavour to persuade Shoreef to allow oombaidmeno o£ dace j and removal of all supplies there on which Turks are counting if they get through mountains* Faisal has 3,000 modern rifles to oppose (?12,000) with heavy guns and machine guns and definitely ste es that if enemy make sustained long autack they cannot but get through (to Babe.1)o In That case majority of his force will disperse^ Situation demands serious consideration and I most strongly urge that at feast 1,000 Mahometan troops (if 3,000 are not available) be sent to Yerbo as soon as possible also two Aeroplanes* I am arriving at Jeddah August 29th and situation being serious propose to proceed to Suez as soon as possible to explain fully to Your Excellency, but trust all steps possible will be taken to provide troops and Aeroplanes* Faisal remains at Yenbo as he cannot face his Arabs unless he can promise them that help is cominge Faisal and Turkish Csptain (prisoner) both estimate Turkish force at Medina at at least 24,000 and latter states Smyrna Division consisting of 17 mixed battalions, strength about 15 ; 000 is leaving Smyrna for Medina by rail* Cannot something be done now from Akaba to permanently cut railway?

With regard to the request for despatch of Mahometan troops to Yenbo to give confidence to Faisal and his Arabs and to threaten flank of any Turkish advance of Ptabej l find it difficult to give definite opinion owing to views of Government of India.and to those of the Sultan of Egypt who fears public demonstration which sending of troops to Hodjaz would afford of Shereef’s dependence on our supnort,might destroy Shereef’s chances of success.

Dccypher. Sir Ho McLtihon (RaraLeh) August 30th r D. ? Rc So50 pm August 30th. Ho. 740, Shoreef has made urgent demands for full.equipment for a force of 40,000 men of which following are most • important items. One fifteen centimetre battery; four ten and half centimetre mountain batteries; four-French Q.F. mountain batteries; (75). Above to be complete in every detail except persnael and with ammunition. Fifty maxim guns and 40,000 rifles with ammunition. Four aeroplanes. Also such things as field • •• glasses and revolvers for officers, wireless telegraph:/, telephones, barbed wire etc. A full list follows by despatch. After (?) careful consideration I am of opinion that we should be prppared to supply the above with the exception of (?) fifteen centimetre guns hut gradually and in proportion to growth of his trained personel and to needs of situation. At present all that can he profitably used is one Q.F. battery 5 7500 rifles, 5 machine guns and two aeroplanes. These ISEPIS-JI f ***•«* i These are most urgently required.

' B ' Uerien or Aeropl.uies with limited resources a 't COinTkinvi • 1 therefore urge most strongly that War Cj.iice is approached with a view to cope with despatch, complete in every detail except personel.

If some nickel Indian Officers' who' have served in France could oe sent (as volunteers) they would be invaluable.- They could return to France when their services •were- no longer required or they could be given (?) leave and sent for definite periods* I -strongly recommend this being done, if Indians \ concur.

He are arranging a pilgrimage so it is vital that military situation be completely safeguarded as regards liecca. In view of urgency Sir Archibald hurray is sending t''o Q.P. guns captured from Turks at Katia but for which unfortunately there are only 400 rounds of ammunition.

Military intelligence estimates Medina force cannot exceed 15,000. Shereef has made urgent demands for (? 7000) more rifles and amraunition, machine .guns, a battery of qyi&amp;lc firing guns (without personnel) and some Aeroplanes. He says Turks are evidently making desperate effort to get Ghereef Haidar into Mecca before pilgrimage.
