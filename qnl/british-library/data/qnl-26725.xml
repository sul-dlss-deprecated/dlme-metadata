He said that, notwithstanding the fact that the French had withdrawn their troops from Syria and that they had agreed to withdraw from the Lebanon, they now found the activities of the Arab League disturbing them in North Africa. It was quite clear to the French Government that, while they had thought that this problem had been finally settled when they reached agreement with the Syrians and the Lebanese, they regretted that, in fact, this was not so.

[E 7014/5/89] Consul-General Havard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received October 18.) (No. 98.) My Lord, Beirut, October 2, 1939. WITH reference to my telegram No. 47 of the 22nd September, I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith the text( 1 ) of Decree No. 246/LR of the 21st September, by which the French High Commissioner suspended certain articles of the Lebanese Constitution relating to the exercise of legisla tive and executive powers. 2. A further decree, No. 247/LR of the 22nd September, defined the powers of appointment reserved to the Lebanese President by article 4 of Decree No. 246/LR as comprising the appointment of :— (i) The heads of the administrative services. (ii) Regional administrators. (iii) Inspectors-general of the administrative services. (iv) Gendarmerie officers of the rank of major and upwards. (v) The five highest ranks of judges in the judicial hierarchy. October 18, 1939. Section 3. Copy No. 3. The High Commissioner accompanied the publication of the former decree by a message to the Lebanese people, which was broadcast from the Beirut station on the 21st September and appeared in the local press the following day. In it he stated that Lebanese of all parties and creeds had declared their solidarity with France in the war imposed upon her, and France was determined to main tain normal and ordered life in the Lebanon. The people must carry on their normal occupations, but must spare no effort to increase the country’s production. For this purpose far-reaching modifications must be made in the political regime, so that party rivalries and place-hunting could give place to quiet industry, great economies be made in an Administration which had proved too cumbrous and expensive for so small a country, and Government decisions be carried out with the greatest despatch. The regime now laid down was to be considered as only a wartime measure, but its practice would furnish useful experience for after the war. The High Commissioner concluded by declaring his intention to keep in close touch with Lebanese political and religious leaders, and his hope that the Lebanon would remain closely bound to France. 4. The new regime would appear in practice to approximate to that insti tuted in July last in Syria (Damascus telegram No. 5 1 of the 9th July to your Lordship), but with rather stricter control by the^ French. 5. With the exception of the displaced Ministers and Deputies and other directly interested parties, the Lebanese people as a whole seem to have warmly welcomed the change of regime, as freeing the country from the cost of an unproductive Administration and putting an end to the futile party squabbles and intrigues which have been so prominent a feature of the last few years. There is a natural tendency to grumble at some of the measures taken as a result of the war, but it is generally hopeful that increased flexibility and rapidity in the implementing of Government decisions, and the liberation of provincial authorities fronAhe fear of ejection at every change of ministry, will create a marked improvement in the country’s administration. 6.

French Minister informs me that arrangements have now been made for these troops to proceed via the Red Sea when they are required, IIe had himself warned General feygand of the risk of passage of even unarmed labour battalions being used for propaganda against General Nuri. General Neygand had agreed and explained that the informal enquiries made here had been merely a precaution taken by his staff. I will communicate the substance of the foregoing to the Prime Minister because he had previously asked me on September 21st whether I could give him any information and indicated that there was some doubt in the minds of certain of his colleagues regarding the propriety of allowing French troops to travel through Iraq. I at once made clear the opinion of His Majesty's Government (see paragraph 4 of your telegram No.336) that the point would be covered by Article 4 of the ^ ( Treaty. If we requested at any time such facilities and ourselves. I also explained on that occasion to General Nuri that from such information as had then reached me I understood the project to be in a very early and tentative stage v/hich was no doubt the reason why no formal approach had been made to the Iraqi Government. Meanwhile the Minister of Defence had assistance they would then be facilities and assistance to beenbeen informed and had indeed been very helpful. The Prime minister pointed out that it was very important that the Iraqi Government should be kept well informed if difficulties were to be prevented and said he would be very glad if he could be told why the French army in Syria had been so greatly increased. He himself assumed that it was being held in reserve for cooperation with Turkey if necessary in the Balkans or even possibly for use in Egypt. Accounts which were being spread in Iraq, by important Iraqis returning from Syria estimated the French army as likely to exceed 100,000. It was being widely contended that as no attack by Italy against Syria could be apprehended, these troops might be intended to restore the position under the Sykes-Picot agreement which, as was still well remembered, had assigned Mosul and Kirkuk to France. I told General Nuri that the latter idea was entirely and obviously fantastic but I will ask the French Minister to furnish him with any information which can properly be given to him regarding the size and purpose of the French army in Syria as it will be much appreciated and helpful to him for countering these a.idicjlou c ^ut mischievous reports.

Ovlng to a misunderstanding the French Minister informed his Government that the Prime Minister had complained to me of the size of the French army in Syria. In consequence the French Government have expressed surprise at such a lack of good-will and gratitude on the part of Nuri Pasha to my French colleague and may also do so to His Majesty’s Government. I have shown my above-mentioned telegram go cne French r.inister and explained that so far as I could judge both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs themselves seemed inclined to welcome the idea of a large French force as likely to exercise useful influence on Turkey and that Nuri Pasha had merely complained that the Irani Government, vdiicn was our ally, was being left in the dark. The French Minister will report further accordingly to the French Government. Confidential. From paragraph 4 of the British Consul Damascus secret report No# 24 of September 26th it looks as though the French Minister here was also in the dark as on September 24th he stated to me quite positively and also authorised me to inform the Iraqi Government that the French forces in Syria did not exceed two divisions and were probably substantially less.

My Lord, X hare the honoxir to inform lour Lordship that the ‘’reach Gomaissloner left Beirut for 1 arie on /ugust 9th. f after having handed over his duties to Monaxeur de Hauteclocque, his c ©legate at haioasoua. 2. The object of Monsieur Xuaux’s visit to rario is doubtless to discuss with his Government the present situation in Cyria since the dissolution of th© Syrian parliament and the vesting of administrative control in a council of Directors. 3. Such, however, is not, in the opinion of some Lebanese political and press circles, the only or principal object of Monsieur Luaux's journey, Dor them the Lebanon looia© larger than liyria in the forthcoming discussions which the High Commissioner will have in ] aris. This view is strengthened by the fact that the president of the Lebanese Lepublic loft in the second half of July for France, ostensibly to take the waters at Vittel, but as it is known that he has had meetings with both Monsieur Baladier and monsieur Bonnet, there is ground for thinking that hi© journey was not unconnected with political objects. 4. hhen it became mown that , onsieur x uaux was shortly to go to JP&amp;ris, Lonsieur Beaiiara el Khoury, tine leader of the Opposition party in L&amp;rliament and a few of hia followers also embarked for France, so as to be at hand in oaee of possible discussions regarding the future of th# Lebanon. / Par#. 5.

The dual a&amp;miniatration - Pranch and Lebanese, whj.eh has been in existence since the beginning of 1937, lias bean bo more successful in the Lebanon than it was in dyria. The Lebanese administration has shown itself to be just as effete as that of yria, and it hat indulged in abuses of many kinds, decently a great scandal was caused by the discovery of extensive plantations of Hashish in the Beqa*a plain; the Minister of dgriculture, Ibrahim Haidar, and several deputies were involved* One of the results of this scandal was that last week Ibrahim Haidar was obliged to resign from the Cabinet. 7. The director of the .&lt;dret6 who had begun to destroy this illicit culture, was suddenly recalled to Prance and will not apparently return. LonsJ.eur Oolomen-mi 1 a rocull should not, ha*ever, be ascribed to his activity in ferreting out this abuse and taking the proper steps to stop it. lather is it because his compatriots had long suspected him of been abusing his position and Lone^eur iuaux must have/convinced that these suspicions were justified, since the orders for iOnaieur Colombani’s recall came at Qd hours notice. 8. from the British point of view, his disappearance■■■■■■■■■■ j ; » ,#ii a'xmsri **&amp;!&amp; tMum*®* . t* i$ m&amp;fmm* **&amp; X'^Vf.i r:*&gt; **x til %*z}j l;':: .^a^q tm%* .:* . * «m&gt; i *:m cv ;: LX '*r . . . •, ..■ • r : b r, ^ .; ^ &lt;h. ^ -' _• ......

V. # xc9&gt; [E 5264/3/89] Copy No. ! R. Newton to Viscount Halifax.—(Received July 25.) (No. 385.) My Lord, Bagdad, July 18, 1939. WITH reference to my telegram No. 244 of the 9th July, 1939, I have the honour to inform you that the decision of the mandatory authorities to suspend the Constitution in Syria was received with a chorus of angry protests in the Iraqi press. 2. The main theme of the articles which have been published is that by this act France has broken all her promises to the people of Syria and has shown her determination to maintain indefinitely colonial rule over the French mandated territories of the Levant. 3. In many articles it was alleged that French and British policies in the Middle East have been co-ordinated with the positive intention of weakening the Arabs and of encroaching upon their hard-won liberties. The cry of encircle ment was borrowed from German propaganda and the shutting-in of the Arabs was declared to be clearly the aim of British and French policy. 4. Some papers pointed to the noble example of Palestine and urged the Syrians to show themselves as brave as their Palestinian brothers. Others remarked that the Syrians themselves were in part to blame for the disasters which had overcome them because they had allowed themselves to be divided and weakened by internal party dissensions. 5. One leader writer declared that for years the Arabs had clung to their trust in the British Government and in the war pledges of the Allies. This trust had now, once and for all, been dispelled, and replaced by feelings of hatred and the desire for revenge. The British and French policy of violence aiming at the extermination of a peaceful and proud people was responsible for this momentous change of feeling, the grave consequences of which God alone could foretell. 6. A happier note has been struck since the arrival in the Lebanon of the young King Faisal. Long accounts of the warm reception given to him by the Syrian and Lebanese people have taken the place of the earlier political diatribes and stories of how His Majesty was hailed as King of Syria have been gleefully published under large headlines. 7., On returning from his visit to Syria to arrange for the King’s reception, the Prime Minister told me that he had been received by his Excellency the French High Commissoner and had discussed the political situation with him. 8. M. Puaux had stated that he wished to negotiate a new treaty with Syria and to bring it into force within a year. It would provide independence for Syria, but would retain the local autonomy which was now being established by decree for the Jabal Druze, the Alawite and the Jazirah. The Prime Minister said that this sounded well-meaning enough, but he feared that the French would find nobody to trust them now in Syria. 9. I took this opportunity to mention that I had heard that it was believed in certain quarters in Syria that if it were not for help and encouragement received from Iraq by malcontents in Syria the political difficulties in that terri tory would soon be solved. It would be unfortunate and embarrassing for all eoncerned if Iraq could be held to blame. The Prime Minister denied the truth of these stories and declared that many of them were circulated by Ibn Sand who received foolish reports from his legation in Bagdad. Recently, for example, it had been put about by the Saudi-Arabian Minister that a large supply of rifles and ammunition had been sent to Syria from Iraq. This was quite untrue, and the Iraqi Government were determined to maintain a correct attitude towards the French authorities in Syria. If, however, the French Government failed to solve their problems in Syria now, a day of reckoning was bound to come. I have, &amp;c.

My Lord, With reference to the sixth paragraph of my despatch No. 385 of July 18th, I have the honour to inform you that I have received in confidence from Dr. Sinderson, the Court Physician, some interesting details a'hout the tumultuous reception given to the little King Faisal II in Syria. Dr. Sinderson accompanied the Royal Party on their journey from Bagdad and remained wioh them at A ey for a week* 2. He tells me that the Prime Minister of Iraq and a large gathering of officials and notables met King Faisal at Abu Shammat (a frontier contra! post some six kilometres outside Damascus) and formed a long procession of cars to Damascus. in Damascus all through the town the streets were crowded with cheering people, scouts and school children waving Iraqi flags and acclaiming King Faisal as their King. Hundreds of motor cars tried to join in the procession but were stopped by barriers put across the streets by the police. Dr. Sinderson's car was itself cut off at one point and he had the greatest d: fficulty in making a way through the jam of traffic and crowds of people. 3* At Aley deputations of Syrian and Lebanese leaders came early to the villa where the King has been installed and one evening the Mufti and several other Palestinian exiles came up under escort to pay their respects. it was possibly/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax K.G. , G.C.S.I. , G.

Dr. Sinderscn also tells me that he noticed that Nuri Said was elated by the warmth of the welcome given 1 to Kin S Faisal and referred to it triumphantly as a sign of the strength of the desire of the Syrians for union with Iraq under a Hashimite sovereign. It may oe suspected that these popular demonstrat were as much to spite the French as to show real affectic for the infant King of Iraq, but Syrian nationalists have long aspired to obtain the same freedom as Iraq and the failure of the Franco-Syrian Treaty of 1936 will now naturally tend to make them lock increasingly to Iraq for salvation and the realisation of their aspirations.

(E 4551/284/65) BRITISH EMBASSY Very Confidential PARIS June 14th, 1939* My dear Lancelot, Your letter (Very Confidential) of the 30th May, about future French policy in Syria. I think that Bonnet must have got a little mixed in his conversation with me on the 16th May. The correct position is that, under the 1936 treaty, the Syrian troops, to whom a French military mission would be attached, v/ere to be under the orders of the Syrian Government. The French troops v/ere to be an independent French command, part of them being some 50 miles from Damascus, and the other part a certain distance from Aleppo - rather on the lines of our arrangements in Iraq. Under the 1938 draft, both Syrian and French troops were to have been under French command. The question of the intervention of French troops to restore order has, I understand, always been a doubtful case and has never been cleared up, but I am assured that it was at no time contemplated that the French troops would be under the orders of the Syrian Government, and the French are not likely to make any change in this respect in the near future. They regard the Syrian troops as capable of dealing with bandits, but quite incapable of conducting a military campaign. Yours ever. (Signed) Eric Phipps.

My Lord, I have the honour to acquaint Your Lordship that in the course of conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning I took the opportunity of speaking to him as directed by your despatch No. 1153 (E 3243/284/65) of May 10th, marked Very Confidential, regarding French policy in Syria. 2. M. Bonnet explained that under the 1936 Treaty, even as modified in 1938, the French troops in Syria would have been at the disposal of the Syrian Government, whereas it is the present intention of the French Government that they shall be at the disposal of the French Ambassador at Beirut, once the further modified Treaty comes into force. 3. I threw a fly over His Excellency respecting the report that had, I said, reached His Majesty*s Government as to the possible intention of the French Government to establish a Monarchy in Syria* M. Bonnet did not deny that this might eventually be done, but he was 'boutonne' on the subject, declaring that all this was very vague at present. Nor would he admit that the French Government had any particular candidate in view to occupy the future/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc., etc., etc.future Throne, Meanwhile, as he remarked rather sadly, the Syrian Owemment had resigned, and some time must elapse before Franco-Syrlan affairs were satisfactorily settled, I have etc,, (SC) Eric Phipps,(£■ 3599/‘&lt;i84/65) 1 VERY CONFIDENTIAL FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 30th May, 1939. My dear Eric, We are rather puzzled by one passage in your despatch No. 648 (221/23/39) Very confidential, of the 16th May, about future French policy in Syria&gt;namely M. Bonnet’s explanations in paragraph 2 to the effect that, under the 1936 Treaty, the French troops in Syria would have been 'at the disposal of' the Syrian Government, whereas it is the present intention of the French Government that they shall be 'at the disposal of' the French Ambassador at Beirut. 2. There was nothing in the 1936 Treaty - so far as we are aware - about the Syrian Government exercising any control over the French forces left in Syria, or of their being able to make use of these forces without the consent of the French Government. Is the new proposal that/ The Right Honourable Sir Eric Phipps, G.C.M.G.,GC.V.0.that the French Government shall he able to employ their troops in Syria, for instance to restore order, even if the Syrian Government have not asked them to do so? If so, it is indeed hard to see how agreement can he reached. Nor is it clear to us what practical advantage such a concession would have, even if it could he negotiated. It seems to us that the French could not, even if they were authorised hy the Treaty to do so, employ their troops in Syria against the wishes of an independent Syrian Government without bringing about a really first-class political crisis, v/hich v/ould shake the whole Treaty policy to its foundations. 3. I don’t wish to trouble you to pursue with M. Bonnet this point of detail. But it is of course an important one on which the whole future of the relations between France and Syria will apparently turn. Will you then let us hear, if you have at any time an opportunity of elucidating what it is that the French Government have in mind?THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT 7* EASTERN (Syria) ^ CONFIDENTIAL.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 530, Very Confidential, of the 26th April last, 1 have the honour to acquaint your Lordship that, as I happened to be lunching next to M. Bonnet on the 29th April, I took the opportunity of asking him whether he could give me a reply to the communication which I had made to him on the 20th April, as reported in my despatch No. 488, Very Confidential, of that date, regarding Syria. ' ~~ 2. M. Bonnet replied that the considered opinion of the French Government, after consultation with the General Staff, was that it would be quite out of the question to bring into force the treaty of 1936, even as modified at the end of 1938. General Gamelin felt strongly that in present circumstances it would be folly to grant complete independence to the Syrians, who were, apart from some of the Christian minorities, a soft race, incapable of defending themselves. If the French troops (numbering about 30,000) were to be withdrawn in the near future, either the Turks, the Italians or the Germans would march into Syria, which would be incapable of putting up any serious defence. 3. I asked M. Bonnet what, in these circumstances, the French Government proposed to do in the matter. His Excellency replied that, as reported in my despatch under reference, the French High Commissioner would be returning to Beirut, where he would arrive on the 10th May, and he would soon afterwards propose to the Syrians further indispensable modifications in the 1936 Treaty. The principal modifications in question will be :t— (i) The further safeguarding of the rights of minorities in Syria; and (ii) The right for France to retain, for a certain number of years, her troops in Syria. 4. M. Bonnet did not seem to anticipate any very violent resistance on the part of the Syrians. The French Government, he said, would, once the treaty thus modified had been brought into force, appoint an ambassador at Beirut instead of a High Commissioner. They would also, in all probability, set up a Senate in addition to the single Chamber now existing, and the Syrians would be given the right to appoint their own diplomatic representatives abroad. 5. M. Bonnet indicated that, in the present disturbed state of the world, it was to the advantage of Great Britain, as much as of France herself, that a fairly strong French force should remain in Syria. 6. My impression is that the French Government have definitely decided to take the course outlined above, and that further representations would be useless and would even be resented. 7. I shall take an early opportunity of speaking to M. Bonnet in the same sense as I have already done to M. Puaux regarding the incursion of armed bands from Syria into Transjordan. I have, &amp;c.

Bonnet my appreciation of his courtesy in supplying me with the information contained therein as to French policy in Syria. 2. I welcome M. Bonnet’s statement that the French Government are proposing to enter into negotiations with the Syrian Government regarding the modifications in the 1936 Treaty which they regard as indispensable. I agree that the withdrawal of the French troops in Syria might in present circumstances he dangerous, notwithstanding the fact that their withdrawal from Syria would not mean their withdrawal from the Lebanon where, even if the Franco- Lebanese Treaty were brought into force, France would apparently be able in effect to keep an unlimited number of troops for an indefinite period. Indeed, I had assumed that the ’’further arrangement regulating the relations ’’between the French Army and the Syrian Army” which was negotiated with Jamil Mardam last autumn (see your despatch No. 1380 (112/50/38) of the 24th November last), already/ His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Eric Phipps, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc., Pario oalready provided for the retention of French troops. 3. I note that while M. Bonnet stated that once the desired modifications have been negotiated and the Treaty brought into force, an Ambassador would be appointed at Beirut instead of a high Commissioner, he did not give any indication that the French Government are considering the establishment of a kingdom in Syria. You will, however, see from the enclosed copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda that M. Puaux appears to have approached King Abdul Aziz with enquiries as to his willingness, in certain circumstances, to allow one of his sons to be appointed King of Syria. . Such a development would be of considerable interest to His Majesty’s Government, particularly in view of the effect which it might be expected to have in neighbouring Arab countries. I request therefore that you will, if you see no objection, and without mentioning M. Fuaux by name, enquire whether there is any information on this subject which the French Government are able to communicate to His Majesty’s Government. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Representatives at Angora, Bagdad, Cairo and Jedda, and His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Beirut and Damascus.

My Lord, With reference to my despatch No. 218 of the 28th April reporting the visit of Naji Shaukat, Iraqi Minister of the Interior, to Angora, I have the honour to inform Your Lordship that, in the course of a talk with the Counsellor of this Embassy, the Minister said that the President of the Turkish Republic had given him a solemn assurance that Turkey had no designs on Syria, or any intention of attacking Syria. 2. The Minister expressed to Mr. Morgan his concern about Syria. Arabs, as a whole, he said, had hoped that Turkey would have agreed to a partition of the Hatay between Turkey and Syria, leaving Antioch to Syria, but AtatUrk had firmly vetoed the notion, and the Arabs accepted his verdict. It now appeared to Naji Shaukat that Prance was ready to acquiesce inthe union of Hatay to Turkey, on condition that the sea and land frontiers of Syria were jointly guaranteed by Turkey and Prance, and his view was that Iraqi opinion would strongly resent a Turco-Prench guarantee of the Syro-Iraq frontier. Passing to the Syro- Prench treaty of 1936, Naji Shaukat emphasised that an early ratification of this treaty by Prance was essential. It would be indifferent to Syria if Prance maintained military forces in Syria after the ratification, for Syria would have obtained the great boon of its independence* If Prance did not ratify the treaty, and continued to keep Syria/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G. , G.C.S. I., G.C.I.E. , etc., etc., etc.2 Syria split up into small States, with priestly influence ^ dominating her attitude towards Syria, there would he, according to Naji Shaukat, trouble in Syria far exceeding any in Palestine, with consequent free play for German and Italian intrigue, and with harmful results on the attitude of the whole Arab world. Ratification, on the other hand, would rally all Arabs to the French and British cause* With tie Palestine problem on the way to solution, and the Syrian question settled, Arabs would be free to follow their natural inclination, which was to side with Great Britain in peace and war. 3. In Iraq itself, the Government policy was, he said, one of entire confidence in His Majesty’s Government. The only frontier which caused anxiety was the Iranian, but if danger threatened from Iran, Iraq counted on British help. As regards internal affairs in Iraq, Germans had been active in intriguing and fomenting agitation. In his capacity as Minister of the Interior, he had recently deported three Germans for undesirable activities. Iraq, he said, did not welcome any attempt on the part of Germany to play any role in Iraqi affairs, and still less welcomed the idea of Italian interference. Italy’s action against Albania had roused deep resentment among Moslems in Iraq, and suspicions of Italian policy. 4.

I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as directed, and, in order to make sure that there should he no possible misunderstanding I left with His Excellency a copy of paragraphs 9 to 17 inclusive of your despatch under reference, making it clear that this must he considered as a very confidential verbal communication. 3. M. Bonnet promised that the French Governne nt would take into the most earnest consideration the views of His Majesty’s Government. He hopes to he able to reply thereto fully some time next week, after the necessary consultations with M. iPuaux, who is now here, have taken place, 4. His Excellency remarked, however, that the French military view was that the Syrians were far too weak m d unpractical at present to he able to govern themselves. Their weakness would he a constant incentive to the Turks to invade Syria, and this of course would cause a highly dangerous situation to develop. 5. As for German and Italian propaganda, that, M. Bonnet feels, would always he altered to suit an altered situation. Now it consisted in telling the Arabs that /Fran ce The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc., etc., etc.,3076 Prance was not keeping her word and would not grant Syria her promised independence» If that independence were granted the propagandists would stir up discontent amongst the Christian Minorities» Mo Bonnet agreed, however, that the disadvantages of 'both systems must he carefully weighedo I have, etco, (Sdc) Eric Phipps,My Lord, With reference to your despatch No. 635, Very Confidential, of the 17th March regarding the policy of the French Government in Syria, I have the honour to inform your Lordship that a member of my staff enquired to-day, in confidence, of the head of the African Department in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs whether there was any indication which the French Government would be prepared to supply regarding the line of policy which they are intending to follow in Syria, 2. M, Lagarde said that he would speak very frankly. In November last an agreement had been reached between the French and Syrian Governments. Opposition had, however, developed both in the French Parliament and also in Syria among the minorities. The French Government had, therefore, decided to postpone further consideration of the policy to be pursued in Syria until the new High Commissioner had been able to examine conditions on the spot and prepare a report, .•/hen M. Puaux^ report had been received and examined the French Government would take a decision as to their future policy in Syria. That was the position at the present moment. 3. ’I/^\ 3* In view of the above explanation, it did not seem desirable to develop to Ivh Lagarde any of the considerations in regard to a possible change in French policy involving more direct control over the mandated territories, which were advanced in your Lordship’s despatch under reference. 4. M. Lagarde was, however, informed that the French Government would be kept informed of the intentions of His Majesty’s Government about Palestine as soon as these were decided. He expressed his gratitude. He remarked that there was a curious difference between the British position in Palestine and the French position in Syria, owing to the fact that in Palestine the administrators were excellent, while the military forces did not know the country well, whereas in Syria the administrators were much inferior to those in Palestine, but the military forces had the advantage of having spent a long time in the country and knowing it well. It was due to the latter factor that order could be kept in Syria. I have, etc., R.I. CAMPBELL.No, 907• (E 2322/284/65) Very Confidential FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 15th April, 1939. Sir, I have received Mr 0 Campbell’s despatch No. 367 (221/8/39) of the 25th March, in which he stated that according to M. Lagarde the French Government had decided to postpone fur'V ar consideration of the policy to be pursued in Syria until the new High Commissioner had been able to examine conditions on the spot and prepare a report„ 2 0 I welcome the information that no final decision has yet been taken by the French Government, since this means that an exchange of views between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government may still not be too late to affect the issue. At the same time I am bound to note that, since the arrival of M. Puaux in Syria, various steps have been taken which indicate that it is not proposed to proceed with the 1936 Treaty, even as amended by the Supplementary Agreement signed in November last. For instance, control of the police in Syria has been resumed by the French authorities, French officials have taken over the offices of Governor in the Jebel Druse and Latakia, and M 0 Puaux has made a tour through the Jezireh, on which he appears to have given open encouragement to autonomist aspirations. 3. His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Eric Phipps, G.C.MoG. , C.V.O., etc., etc., etc 0 , Paris.mm3 0 His Majesty's Government have never felt entirely happy about the decision of the French Government not to proceed with the ratification of the 1936 Treaty, even after the negotiations for its amendment in certain admittedly necessary ways had reached an apparently successful conclusion,, They have hitherto hesitated to give expression to their misgivings for various reasons, including reluctance to interfere in what the French Government may well regard as a question for themselves alone, fear of reviving the old misapprehension that this country distrusts and resents the position of France in the Levant, and consciousness of the fact that their own experiences in Palestine do not add to their qualifications for playing the role of adviser. 4. More recently, however, the situation has been affected by two new factors: namely, the fresh deterioration in the international situation since the middle of March, and the attitude of this country's allies. 5 0 In Iraq in particular recent developments in Syria are regarded with strong feelings. The Iraqi Government have on various occasions in the past asked His Majesty's Government to press the French Government to expedite the entry into force of the 1936 Treaty, but His Majesty's Government have never given the Iraqi Government any ground for thinking that they would do so. Recently the Iraqi requests have become more insistent and on the 23rd March the late King Ghazi asked Mr. Houstoun-Boswall to convey a message to The King (see Mr, Houstoun-Boswall's telegram No 0 86 of the 23rd March). King Ghazi pointed out that if war broke out the Iraqi Government would find themselvesI,7 themselves in the unenviable position of supporting the British Empire ? whose allies would very likely be engaged in repressive measures against the Arabs in Syria. Ibn Sauc., also, has told His Majesty 1 s Minister at Jedda that if King Ghazi were to send a message to The King on the subject he himself would have to do so too. Since then Mr. Houstoun-Boswall has reported (see his telegram No. 99 cf the Gist March) that public interest in the situation in Syria is likely soon to develop into serious agitation, and he fears that, if disturbances break out in Syria, men and arms will be despatched surreptitiously from Iraq, and persistent pressure be put upon His Majesty’s Government by the Iraqi Government to persuade the French Government to ratify the 1936 Treaty. He further fears that a bitter campaign of propaganda will also be waged against France in which Great Britain, as France’s close associate, will certainly become involved. 6 . I recognise that this cfbestiom does not directly concern any neighbouring country and that the French Government have already on tv/o occasion made it clear that they do not welcome the interest shown in it by the Iraqi Government. But His Majesty’s Government cannot so easily ignore the views of their ally. They are satisfied that the Iraqi Government are genuinely and justifiably apprehensive of the ultimate effects on the alliance of the present policy in Syria, and they are bound to take these apprehensions into account. Moreover, should war break out, the fate of France would depend quite as much as the fate of this country upon the loyal co operation of Egypt, Iraq and other Arab countries^7 0 His Majesty’s Government therefore feel that a point has been reached where they are entitled, on grounds of high policy and in view of the close friendship between the two Governments, to make their position clear to the French Government e 8 o I request therefore that Your Excellency will, unless you see strong objection, seek an interview with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs and speak to him on the following lines: 9 0 You should begin by saying that you have been instructed to raise with him a question closely affecting the interests of the two countries, that is to say their joint position in the Middle East,, In raising this question His Majesty*s Government desire to make it clear at the outset that whatever policy the French Government may hereafter pursue in the Middle East, and particularly in the Republic of Syria, His Majesty’s Government will loyally support them to the best of their ability, even though it may not be the policy which they think that they themselves would be likely to pursue in similar circumstances^ His Majesty’s Government say this because they recognise that the fates of the two countries are bound up together and their co-operation in any part of the world cannot and must not be affected by divergencies of view on even important issues 0 They hope that this unreserved assurance of co-operation will be taken as proof, were proof needed, that, in making the suggestions which follow, His Majesty’s Government are concerned for French interests quite as much as for their own 0 10o You should then say that His Majesty’s Government understandunderstand that, pending the receipt of a report from Mo Puaux, the French Government have not reached a decision as to what their future policy in Syria will Toe. At the same time, certain administrative measures have been taken in Syria v/hich imply that the French Government do not now intend to adhere to the 1936 Treaty settlement, even as amended in 1933, His Majesty’s Government would not be frank if they pretended that this apparent change in policy has not from the start filled them with misgiving. They are as desirous as the French Government that conditions should not be created in any territory under French control in the Levant in which the growth of German or Italian influence would be encouraged. But the question is whether the growth of this influence is likely to be encouraged or discouraged by a retreat from the 1936-1938 settlement, 11o So far as the immediate needs of public order and good government are concerned, His Majesty’s Government do not presume to question the present policy, as this policy is doubtless based upon considerations of which His Majesty’s Government are necessarily ignorant. Moreover, they recognise that it will enable the French Government to take a stronger line with any agitators from Palestine than has been possible while the Syrian Government were in direct control© But upon a longer view His Majesty’s Government cannot help feeling that the day has passed when the clock can be put back in a country like Syria, which was moreover the first home of Arab nationalism. It seems to them inevitable that unless the people of Syria can soon be assured that they areare not after all to tie denied within a reasonably near future the degree of independence already achieved by Egypt and Iraq, and now virtually promised to Palestine, they are likely to afford a far more profitable field than otherwise for the propaganda and intrigues of Germany and Italy, with consequences which may eventually prove disastrous to both Prance and Great 3ritain 0 12o Moreover Great Britain is the ally of two countries ? Iraq and Egypt, in which sympathy for Syria i&amp; widespread,, His Majesty’s Government are well aware that the French Government do not regard the Iraqi Government as having any status in regard to Syria and consider that their attitude falls little short of one of interference in the internal affairs of a neighbouring country. But this does not alter the fact that the loyalty of Iraq, as well as Egypt, to the alliance with Great Britain is quite as vital to the interests of Prance as to those of Great Britain,, 13* In this connexion you should say that His Majesty’s Government have repeatedly pointed out to the Iraqi Government that it is in the best interests of Syria to reach some mutually satisfactory arrangement with Prance which is the only well-disposed Power able and willing to afford her that measure of protection which she unquestionably requires at the present time* They have warned the Iraqi Government not to encourage extremist claims on the part of the Syrians, but to exercise their influence in Syria on the side of moderation. His Majesty’s Government believe that the more sensible Iraqi statesmen recognise the soundness of this advice. Nevertheless,Nevertheless, agitation in Iraq is already developing, and it is to he feared that, if disturbances break out in Syria, the Iraqi Government may be compelled by public opinion to take certain steps which might embarrass their relations, not only with the French Government, but also eventually with His Majesty : s Government» 14. In normal times, such a situation might be viewed v/ithout undue disquiet, particularly in view of the large and efficient forces which the French Government retain in Syria-, In the present world conditions, however, His Majesty's Government regard it as essential for both France and Great Britain to remain on terms of close friendship with the various Arab States and the Iraqi Government have already expressed to His Majesty’s Government their apprehensions regarding the difficulty which they might have in keeping the people of Iraq loyal to the alliance in a war in which His Majesty’s Government were also the allies of a Power v/hich would very likely be engaged in repressive measures against the Arabs in Syria. 15. So far as concerns Palestine, which has been hitherto, and for the moment no doubt remains, a far more serious cause for dissatisfaction in the Arab world than Syria, His Majesty’s Government are now risking unfavourable Jewish reactions in America and elsewhere, which might in themselves have an appreciable effect upon the international situation in an emergency, by making a determined effort to reach a settlement of the Palestine problem. They trust that this settlement, while safe guarding the position which the Jews have created for themselves in Palestine, will be acceptable, if not tf&gt; the Arabs in Palestine, then at least to the general mass of opinion(&lt;%■* opinion in the neighbouring Arab States e The French Government may think this a somewhat belated move and His Majesty^s Government would not for a moment wish to minimise the seriousness of the situation which has prevailed in Palestine during the last two years* But however this may be. His Majesty’s Government cannot conceal the anxiety v/hich they feel au to the possible effects of the present position in Syria were war to break out in the near future, 16o His Majesty’s Government are aware that, in view of the lack of natural unity in Syria, a settlement precisely on the lines of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty may not be advisable, and they are certainly not anxious that the French Government should do anything which would lead to political instability in any part of their mandated territories, since this might also, in present circumstances, have dangerous repercussions in the Middle East, They trust, however, that, when the French Government come to decide what their policy in Syria shall be, the French Government will give due weight to the importance of Arab friendship, both to themselves and to His Majesty’s Government, particularly in time of war, 17, You should conclude by asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to bring these considerations to the notice of his colleagues as the considered views of His Majesty’s Government and to express the hape that they will in due course authorise him to inform you fully of the policy which they decide to pursue u 18, Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Representatives at Angora* Bagdad, Cairo and JeddaJedda and Damascus 0 to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Beirut and I am 5 with great truth and respect, Sir, Your Excellency’s obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State)3 .

(R begins) Your telegram No. 86 [of March 23rd: Anglo-Iraqi relations]. French President had left London when your telegram was received but in any case His Majesty’s Government would not have felt able to advise The King to urge on Monsieur Lebrun, in compliance with iving Ghazi’s request, the desirability of modifying French policy in Syria. Nevertheless, His Majesty’s Government attach real importance to views of Iraqi Government, and you may assure General Nuri accordingly. 2. You may add that His Majesty's Government understand the bonds of sympathy between all Arab States, and as they showed when General Nuri raised the matter in London they are ready to discuss in all frankness with the Iraqi Government the whole position as regards Syria. They are strongly of opinion that it would be most unwise of Syria in present world circumstances to risk a quarrel with France, which is the only well-disposed Power able and willing to afiord her that measure of protection which she unquestionably requires at present time. The politicians of Damascus would be far better employed in strengthening their own hold over the country, especially in outlying regions where they have no influence at present, than in quarrelling with their best friends. His Majesty’s Government earnestly hope that all responsible Syrians will see matter in this light and will strive to reach some mutually satisfactory arrangement with French Government. His Majesty’s Government trust that Iraqi Government will exercise their influence in Syria on the side of moderation.2 . 3. If Iraqi Government are uneasy, His Majesty’s Government consider it all to the good that they should approach the French Government direct and explain their views frankly, and His Majesty’s Embassy in Paris have just been asked at Taufiq Suwaidi* s request to arrange for him to be received at the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs on his way through Paris. Please inform Iraqi Government accordingly. (R ends). 4. For your own information His Majesty’s Government do not doubt that French are fully alive to value of Arab friendship. They would probably not feel able to press French Government to ratify the 1936 Treaty if the French Government considered that this would lead to political instability in Syria which might in present circumstances have dangerous repercussions in the Middle i^asc. But they are inclined to agree with Iraqi Government that present French policy, so far as they can understand it, is unwise, and I have recently instructed His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris to make certain enquiries of the French Government regarding their Syrian policy. Position will be further considered on receipt of French Government’s reply.

Meanwhile following is my appreciation of Syrian situation as it affects Iraq. It is becoming clear here that public interest in the situation in Syria is likely soon to develop into serious agitation. Newspapers are publishing violent articles. In Nationalist circles feeling is strong and there is much talk of organizing active support for Syrian Arabs. Ties of public sympathy and personal contacts of leaders are much closer between Iraq and Syria than between Iraq and ISLestine and I fear that if, as seems likely, serious disturbances break out in Syria, agitation which will be aroused here will be even stronger than that which has been excited by troubles in Palestine. Probable results will be: (a; Persistent pressure on His Majesty^ Government to persuade French Government to ratify Franco-Syrian Treaty of 1936. (b) Surreptitious despatch of men and arms to Syria. 3. Both developments would be embarrassing. A bitter campaign/. . . • • . I . ? , '■ . . .&lt;• '' ■ Y o • iiC'i ' . J . r .

On my arrival the Cabinet suspended the sitting and I was received by King Ghazi who was attended by the Prime Minister Minister of Defence and Minister of Finance. It was explained that the Cabinet had in the course of review of the wodd situation and the possibility of war and had reached the conclusion that three points involving British and Iraqi interests required attention. 1. Syria. His Majesty asked me to convey to the King an expression of his earnest hope that the opportunity of the French State visit would be taken to urge on the announcement at this stage in the present international situation of the ratification of the treaty with Syria of 1936. Deplorable effects of the present French policy were emphasised and it was pointed out that if war broke out Iraqi Government would find themselves in an unenviable position of supporting the British Empire whose French allies would very likely be engaged in repressive measures against the Arabs of Syria.
