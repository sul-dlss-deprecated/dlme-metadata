Capt.J.B.Howes very kindly agreed to this suggestion. To the best of our knowledge no such circular has been passed and as such most of the employees are under the Impression that this was only a temporary body and no longer in existence. In the circumstances, we would W take necessary steps. request you U (jULAJsM* Yours very truly. Representatives, Class II Employees, BAPCC• a.(D V Political Agency. No. C/689 Bahrain, the 10th November 1938. To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, BAHRAIN . / Dear Sir, A I I enclose herewith a copy of a communication which has been received from certain representatives of the Class II Indian employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Comoany. It is evident that there has been some misunderstanding and I should be greatly obliged if you would inform those representatives of the Indian employees who met Captain Howes on the 9th Sep tember 1938 tiat I am In no circumstances prepared to accord official recognition to any committee. The object of th^t meeting was to explain to representatives of the Indian employees the means that they should fdopt in composing such differences as might arise between themselves and the Company, and there is no basis for their belief that Captain Howes agreed to any suggestion that official rGcognltlon should be granted to an elected committee. I personally can see no possible object in such a committee being formed, since Indian employees have already been assured by the Company of sympathetic consideration of any complaints that individuals might have, and it has further been explained that any employee who, after his complaint has been dealt with by the Personnel I/anager, still believes that he has good and sufficient reasons for feeling aggrieved, has the right to approach the Political Agent. The position still holds/--2- holds good and I have no intention of permitting a committee to Intervene between myself and any person who wishes to lay a grievance before me.

It is satisfactory that the case vras closed. At the same time I regarded the prevention of similar complaints in the future as of considerable importance. I therefore instructed ./eightman to write to the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company as follows t That the Government of India have accepted the view that the complaints of Hesars. O -Ves etc. were without foundation. ,r, hat this is satisfactory, but that it is in the interests of the Company in view of their Indian market that such complaints, however ill-founded, should not appear in the Indian iVess, and thereby give the Company a bad name. That the Company should issue a circular to its Indian employees stating (^) tiiat if they have any complaints to make tnese should be lodged with the Company^s Director of Personnel ( or some such off iceri who has been given definite instructions by the Company to examine sympathetically the complaints of Indian employees, (b) That tnere may be &amp; feeling tnat employees who complain may, in one way or another, be penalised, but that this fear is, of course, entirely unfounded. 2./ Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KOI'S. ,&lt;131. , Secretary to the Government of India, external \ffairs Department, New Delhi.© -2- 2.

The petition is signed by the three Sunni Q,adis and by a number of respectable houseowners in the vicinity of the building. 3. Although the house is near the brothel area it is not in the brothel area and the residents near it are respectable people. I think they have a legitimate grievance which this Government cannot disregard. 4. The Bahrain Government when dealing with such complaints about Bahrain subjects invariably . orders the occupants of houses to cease from keeping a brothel or to remove themselves to the recognised brothel areas. 5» 1 appreciate that some sort of establishment is necessary but 1 do not think the present arrange ment can continue. The most suitable arrangement would'' Ul'~ w : ■ ■ . ■. : -i : - r) would be for the company to find a building in some secluded spot, outside the town, which would not become a matter for public criticism* and complaint• 1 have not referred this matter to His Highness and I am reluctant to do so but I am quite sure that His Highness would express very definite views on the undesirability of continuing the present arrangement which is a cause of incon venience to a number of his subjects. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government\ y The Adviser, Bahrain G-overnment, Bahrain, After Compliments:- We, the undersigned persons beg to put before your kind consideration our complaint about the house belonging to Haji Yusuf bin Abdulrehman Fakhro, situated on the Amarah at Nairn, opposite the artesian well. This house has been let to the American Company. It has become a brothei place in our quarter. Its Dharar (danger) is increasing daily. Women enter the house publicly during the day and night time. They come on foot or in cars from everywhere with unveiled faces, sit with the American people and do something against God^ orders. They prostitute and drink liquor. They talk loudly and shout causing disturbance to the neigh bouring houses. When they drink they begin to throw stones, juss, etc., on the passere-by and on the people taking water from the artesion well. Prostitution, which act is against Islamic religion and against honour, is considerably increasing in this place. We submit our this petition to you and solicit that you may kindly make something to resecue us asd taking this away from here; may God make you the administrator of Justice, orderer of good deeds and for\iidder of bad ones. To you, being our administrators, we should complain and say;that we have not the liberty of speaking a single word in our quarter; we have been overcome by humiliation. This is all due to the prostitttion deeds. The noble person feels the slightest bad word, while bad person will never feel the constant contempt or humility.ili -2- A'Hadeeth* says; 'Be faithful to God whereever you may be, erase your bad deeds with good ones and see that you go with people in good manner'.

I ao not however think tnat thi^ is so, and I believe that the real truth is that tuts institution has always been unpopular in its particular neighbourhood, that with tht depart ure of most of your temporary construction men from Awaii it was less usea I'lij. wasi therefore leas of &amp;n offence to tne local residents, but that its unpo^u.arity has grown again recently owing to the large numbers of visitors from D^ammanu 3. I re&amp;xlse that there may be quite a lot of difficulty in finding an alternative house for a purpose which I imagine is essential in a ploce like this, but I would strongly adv se you tc r .a«.tcver you can to meet this complaint. It is one of tnose grievances which, if left unmet, is liKely to grow and to cause a gooa deal of difficulty in the future.

The case briefly is this, for reasons not frivolous I have resigned my position with my company, after having served approximntely two-thirds of iqy term of agreement. In their acceptance of this, they indicate that I must pay my own passage home • There are a number of my colleagues who have, and still are submitting to this, which seems to me to be unfair, as the cost of a passage from here is considerable, and would usually a;sorb the bulk, if not the whole of ones savings.

No.3 is an Esthonian; No.4 became a naturalised American in 1^18 and has served in the U.S. Army and Navy; No.5 also became a naturalised American in lt&gt;2^. The Company have asked for further orders regarding Nos.3, 4 and 5. Thev have also had a request from one Franz Josef hUSA, at present working as a ladies' hair-dresser in the Air Port Hotel, Basra, for permission to come to Abadan pending his departure to India, for which country he has asked for a visa from the British Consul in Basra.

Dear Alban, Lipp has been talking to me about opening a a brothel for the company employees in Manamah or Muharraq, They had a house before which even tually roused a public petition from the neigh bourhood. It was shut down and later they hired another house which was never opened as Thornburg disapproved. Lipp argues that a regular house will dimish danger of V.D. Personally I am doubtful if this would be the case. Apart from any moral views I think such an establishment is undesirable and today I sounded Shaikh Sulman on the subject. He took it up very strongly and as a result of our conversation I wrote a letter to Lipp of which I enclose a copy. The Bahrain Government will have nothing to do with establishing a company brothel and if the company tries to do this independently the Shaikhs will object to it. Lipp asked me if the govern ment would help by finding a house for them. The Shaikhs point of view is that they could not approve of a special house where Moslem prostitutes are provided for company employees, such a thing would bring discredit on the government and would be very displeasing to Arab feeling. I think it is most desirable that the company should drop the scheme and I think my letter to Lipp will have this effect but if it does not we are prepared to take up the matter officially.

Attention: Mr. G-. N. Jackson. Referring to your verbal request yesterday for the 'basic wage rates paid our British Indian Artisan employees. The present hiring rate for Artisans is Rs 5 per working day with 26 working days guaranteed per month, and for approximately one year now we have contracted no British Indian Artisans at less than this rate. However, our established Artisan rate is Rs 4 per working day. This lower 'basic rate would 'be utilized in the event of large scale temporary employment programme in which we would employ men with limited qualifications at this rate. We have four such employees at present, who are a 'balance of locally hired British Indians during construction period. In considering the rate of pay for Artisans, we feel that certain amenities provided these employees should 'be taken into account and also the percent of employees receiving the 'basic and higher rates of this group. The following tabulation, from which we have excluded the four individuals mentioned above, shows minimum, maximum and average rates 'being paid this group of employees 1st January 1939 and 1st January, 1942 British Indian Artisans: 1-1-39. 1-1-42 Refinery Operators: Minimum Wage Maximum Wage Mechanics, Fitters, Minimum Wage Maximum Wage TOTAL - Artisans Minimum Wage Maximum Wage Average Wage 9% - Rs4/-/- to Rs5/-/- 69% - Rs5/-/- to Rs7/-/- 22^ - Rs7/-/- to RslO/-/- Rs ver day Rs -per day 4-0-0 4-8-0 11-0-0 10-0-0 3-8-0 4-0-0 10-0-0 10-0-0 j 4-0-0 4-0-0 f 11-0-0 10-0-0 5-6-0 6-5-0-CON-855. - 2 - 18th February, 1942. In addition to wages, these men receive (D - (2) - (3) - (4) - (5) - (6) - ' (7) (8) id* 'V IX C • / A 0 Free medical attendance while in zone of operations, which includes such treatment as one would receive in the ordinary course from a qualified medical practitioner, 'but excludes special treatment requiring the attention of a specialist, unless employee sustained industrial injury necessitating same. Employee's family, who are in Bahrein at the Company's permission, receive free medical treatment similar to that given to the employee. Employee's absence from duty 'because of sickness or accident. Employee receives half pay during that period of absence provided he has 'been attended throughout 'by one of the Company's recognised medical agencies. Compensation for permanent, partial or total disability resulting from industrial injury is paid in accordance with the Indian Workers Compensation Act currently in force. Employee receives full pay for travel time between Bahrein and place of recruitment, which is paid in full over the most direct route. Third-class passage, plus food alloeance of Rs 1/8/- per day for meals is provided to and from place of recruitment. Employee receives vacation of l-l/6th days per month completed while on Foreign Service, provided he has completed at least 12 months in the zone of operations. Vacation is granted at one-half pay, with the second half payable on return for further service. Transportation is provided between Baffa Camp and Refinery or Awali for the purposes of work. Employee is provided free housing. In lieu of housing employees who have their families in Bahrein with the Company's permission and are living in Manama, receive Rs 20 per month temporary housing allowance. Yours very truly, i // M.

A statement showing the pre-war and present prices of staple foodstuffs in Bahrain^? , r Political Agent, Bahrain.# CON-975 - - 2 - 11th March, 194, It has 'been the practice of this Company to pay its employees a fair wage, sufficient to enable them to provide themselves with the necessities of life, and 'by adherring to a systematic saving programme, 'build a Provident Fund for use after retirement. The Company has, as evidenced 'by Exhibit I of the attached Memorandum, during the past three years progressively increased the wages of non-staff employees, enabling these people to withstand normal fluctuations in the selling prices of commodities. After your review of our present wage scale, in conjunction with salaries 'being paid in this community 'by other employers, we would appreciate your advising us if you consider the wages now 'being paid to our local and Indian employees adequate. If not, any suggestions that you may have to offer will 'be carefully considered and presented to our Principals for their final decision. We have often found that after adjustments are made the merchants usually raise their prices and unless strict price control measures are enforced, continual rises will follow. We feel, therefore, that such measures should 'be enforced, otherwise there appears to 'be no limit to prices that will 'be charged. This is a practice adopted with some success in other parts of the world. The cost of living has unquestionably increased and based on our surveys, this increase has been approximately 36/^ during the past year. This same condition apparently prevails substantially throughout the Near East, as evidenced by articles appearing in 'The Petroleum Times' of 15th November 1941, in which it is noted that the Labour Council in Haifa indicates the cost of living has risen 36^.. Also, an article in the magazine 'Great Britain and the East H of 23rd October 1941 indicates that the cost of living has increased 40/t in ^gypt, as compared with the pre-war rate. In this connection, however, I am tabulating the average payments made various groups of employees in Bombay India, by Llessrs. Caltex (India) Limited as compared with the average payments made by the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited for similar employees :- Average Payments Per month : BATTTTRTN : BOMBAY : Clerical-Technical Ps 275. Rs 140. Artisans Rs 159. Rs 3 per day. Domestics Rs 71. Rs 45. We are informed that in the Madras district, from which point a substantial number of our clerical employees were recruited, wages are about 10,^ lower than in the Bombay district.CON-975 - 3 - 11th March, 1942. In considering this matter I should, like to suggest that you 'bear in mind that the inclination of the employee upon encountering increases in the cost of living is to appeal to his employer for increased wages or an allowance to meet the situation. In this instance, irrespective of whether an allowance is found warranted or not, I should like to point out that it seems unreasona'ble to expect industry to pay all the contingencies 'brought a'bout 'by war time conditions as this is a 'burden that should 'be shared 'both 'by the employer and employee. I shall appreciate your reaction to this matter at your earliest convenience. (2) Yours very truly, ^7^. M. H.

Price control already exists in Bahrain and, particularly in / regard—2*- regard to foodstuffs, is strictly enforced. There is no danger, therefore, of an increase in wages producing any reaction on prices. Meximum prices for all staple commodities are fixed at frequent intervals by the Food Controller, the Bahrain price being determined by the price of the commodity at the time of its export from India plus freight and insurance and a reasonable profit to the middleman. Bahrain is dependant for almost all its supplies on India, and price increases in Bahrain are a reflection of similar Increases in India. The price of commodities in Bahrain is, therefore, determined not by local conditions or circumstances (such as an in crease in remuneration to the wage-earning class) but by conditions in India over which, of course,! can exercise no control. 4. I enclose for your information comparative statements showing pre-war prices (i.e. prices on 1st September 1939) and prices in March 1942 in (a) India and (b) Bahrain. These statements show how successful price control has so far proved to be in Bahrain; and they also show that, since the beginning of the War, the rise in the cost of staple foods has been in the neigh bourhood of 100 % .

Dear Sir, In view of the fact, thet cost of livinc; in general, both here as well as in India, has been affected to a very great extent by abnormally heavy rise in the prices of not only food stuff but all the other necessities of life also; we the C. T» employees of the Company, who have for long been expecting and looking forward for a spontaneous outflovr of kindly and parental help towards us at the hands of our employers; now feel obliged to approach the management for the grant of an adequate '■'lav Allowance. We believe thF.t by so doing the Company will undoubtedly relieve us from the extra burden we have been made to carry and afford us an opportunity to reciprocate the kindly feelings thus exhibited by pouring forth our heart-felt thanks. V /hile on this subject, may we also request the management to kindly inau.'nirate the institution of the long promised Provident Fund . Personalities not less than Ilessrs. S. A. Skinner and 0-7 A. Kellenberg talked to some of us on this subject in an assuring way and we feel that by bringing it to life at this stage, the management will of course win our admiration.

Present:- -The Political Agent, Mr^C^D^Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Government. Mr •J.Campbell, Manager, Gray Mackenzie Co. Mr«M*Gunn, Manager, Eastern Bank Limited* MrJS.V.Packer, Manager, Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Mr.F.W^Ohliger, Manager, California Arabian Standard Oil Company. Mr .Ward P.Anderson, Manager, Bahrain Petroleum Co. Mr.B.Crow (Bahrain Petroleum Company). The Political Agent opened the discussion by giving information about the prices of foodstuffs nov as compared with September 1939, by describing the system of price control in Bahrain and by touching on some of the factors which affected local prices. The Political Agent further gave information about the amount of stocks of food at present in Bahrain and explained that the most important factor in replenishing stocks was that of shipping space. The question of using native craft to a greater extent was discussed, but Messrs. Belgrave and Campbell pointed out that, owing to the monsoon, import by dhows is not possible during the 6 months June to October inclusive. After this preliminary talk the conference took up the question whether an increase in wages was justified. It was generally admitted that the cost of living had risen but the majority of the persons present took the view that the wage scale of Indians was already so generous that a rise in the cost of foodstuffs, clothing material etc. did not in any way affect their ability to pay for the necessities of life. Mr.Qunn was strongly opposed to any increase in pay being given to persons earning more than fis 200/- a month. Mr •Belgrave said that he had not consulted His Highness the Shaikh and could therefore not speak authoritatively but he thought His Highness would probably agree to give an allowance to employees of the Bahrain Government on a low rate of pay provided, of course, that they were not in receipt of rations (the Bahrain Police1* •3- Police e.g. are given rations) • Mr.Waixl Anderson and Mr.Ohliger urged that the wages given to their employees in the past left a very considerable margin above a 'living wage* i*e* the minimum wage necessary to support a man and his family. MroOhliger said that some years ago the daily wage of unskilled labour was 10 annas* This rate had gradually been raised until now it was Re. 1/-^and Re. 1/2 for persons who had been in the Company's employment for a year or more. He said that this rate, in spite of the increase in the cost of living^ constituted still a living wage and 9 while he admitted the responsibility of an employer to see that employees received a living wage, he saw no reason why higher wages should be paid gratuitously. J /j ^ At this point of the discussion Mr. Gunn showed the recently Conference a copy of a cable which he had/rece 1 ved from the Directors of the Eastern Bank in London. The wording of the cable was as followst* The Directors wish me to emphasize to you, and through you to the whole of the staff, that, the Bank cannot be ex pected to provide them with full relief from the higher cost of living and that under present circumstances a ft I in the general standard of living must be accepted by every body as part of the burden of war. ' Mr. Gunn took this ctible to mean that no help was to be given to the Ban^s employees to enable them to meet the higher cost of living, and it was necessary for me to point out that his Directors had only taken objection to providing employees with 'full relief tt . The implication was, 1 said, that the employee should be given some relief from the higher cost of living. 3. Mr .Ward Anderson denied strongly that his Company was under any obligation to help its employees to meet the increased cost of living. He pointed out that the wage given to the Company^s employees had not been determined by consideration of their living expanses and should not in any way be tied down to this factor. He said that if for one mement the principle was admitted that there existed a basic connection between wages and living cost^ every increase in price would be reflected by a / demanddemand on the part of employees for an increase in pay* He said that the qaeation we were now discussing was not concern ed with the grant of a living wage since it was admitted on all sides that all classes of the Company^ employees were in receipt of a living wage* What we were d iscassing, he said, was the question whether, because living costs had in creased, there should be a compensating rise in the pay of employees, and he denied emphatically that the Company was under any obligation to compensate its employees for the reduction in their savings which was the result of the rise in prices. 4« 1 said that the matter must be considered from a psychological as well as from an economic view point. In dian employees at Abadan and Kuwait had been given an increase of pay, and Indian employees in Bahrain would want t^o know why they were not being similarly treated. European and American employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company had been given a bonus to compensate them for the increased cost of living and other employees might well ask what justification existed for this d iscrimination. Further, I gave an indica tion of what was proposed in regard to Industrial conscription (although I asked persona present at the Conference to keep this matter confidential) and I pointed out how much better it would be for all concerned if this measure were preceded by a sympathetic gesture on the part of the Company• 5* Mr .Ward Anderson admitted the relevance of these observations but said that he was still opposed to anything in the nature of a 'dearness allowance^ which employees would expect to be increased if living coats rose still fur ther. kr.Ohliger was equally opposed to raising the basic wage of employees since it would be impracticable to bring wages on to a lower level when prices again became normal. Several members of the Conference thought that| if any allow ance were given to meet the increased cost of living^it / shouldshould be 'termed a ' r borms lt * I opposed this suggestion since the term 1 bonus 1 has a mis leading significance said employeea who had asked for an allowance to meet the Increased cost of living would be dissatisfied. Eventually it was agreed that if any additional allowance were given it should be termed a 'war allow- ance'. This term was unobjectionable from all points of view since it- did not constitute a change in the basic wage scale nor, at the same time, would it give employees justification for demanding a further increase in pay when living costs again in creased. 6. Members of the Conference emphasised the importance of price control and in this respect I was able to give them the necessary assurance^, l said that i thought a further rise in pricej inevitable but that this rise would be in the future^ as it had been in the past^ proportionate to the rise of pricey in India, and 1 added that price control in Bahrain would ensure that local factors e«g* increase of wages or short supply^ would not affect the price level. ?• 1 asked members of the Conference, other than those representing the Bahrain Petroleum Company aM the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, whether their interests would be adversely affected if the Oil companies raised the wages of their employees. They all replied in the negative. Either they had given already small increments or they were prepared to do so in future. 8. It was generally agreed that if a war allowance were given to Indian employees a similar allowance should also be given to Bahrain! employees. 9# Before the Conference broke up Mr .Ward Anderson said that he thought that a number of useful points had emerged in the course of the discussion and that he would let me know as soon as possible, after further study of the case, what his Company had decided.

Since the beginning of the war the price of staple xoodstuf. s in Bahrain, such as rice, cofl'ee sugar, ilour, dates etc., has risen on an average by 95^. «5. The chief employer of labour in Bahrain is BAPC0&gt; and they are giving urgent consideration to the question of granting an allowance to their Indian and Bahrain! employees. No increase in pay has yet been granted to local employees oi the Indian and Bahrain Governments, but such increase will probably be given very shortly, when BAPCO's decision is known. 4. I think it will be desirable for the pay of civi lian personnel employed at the Base to be increased in the near future, but before aeciaing the amount of the increase it would probably be wise to await BAPCO's decision.

Bahre in, May 25th. 1942 Through ; His Britannic Majesty*s political Agent Bahre iru Sir, The Bahrein petroleum Co. Ltd., has forwarded to us your letter N o .c/625 dated 8th May 1942, together with Defence Regulation No. 2 of 1942, promulgated bj'' the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for which we hereby beg to tender our thanks to all concerned. In the outset we cannot but give full credit to the guidance obtainable from your esteemed letter without which the true import &amp; importance of the regulation in question would not have been fully comprehended. And having so realized to the full extent, the vital importance of our company's operations to the National interests, we hereby express our eagerness to stand body and soul, to the call of our Benign Govt, for the operation and mainten ance of such essential undertakings and beg to assure you of our faithful abidance to the Law &amp; Order, at the same time sanguinely hoping that our interests will also be justly looked after. Your goodself must be well aware that today in our Motherland viz. India itself not to speak of Iraq, Egypt or elsewhere, there does exist a great demand for well qualified and well experienced hands, on handsome &amp; of course very attractive salaries plus manifold other benefits and facilities mostly offered by the Government itself for either direct or indirect military service and you would appreciate that some of us who have either gone back or were resolving to leave Bahrein with the intention of laying their services at the disposal of the Home Government at this time of dire necessity, should be deemed not only right but wise as well, in so far as they had meant to kill two birds with one stone. But as by the enforcement of this Regulation we are to remain at our posts and not to leave Bahrein, our chances for distinguishing ourselves in the National service and rising to a good position at the same time, are evidently marred. Our only solace and refuge, however, lies in ; - a) The second sentence of the 3rd paragraph of your letter and b) The first four or five lines of the 6th Paragraph. We are told that our position will now be the same as that of persons employed by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company and that Company being the biggest and oldest oil concern in the Gulf, having by far the greatest number of Indian Clerks in its employ, we beg to lay before you the normal and not war-time facilities granted to their employees which are denied to us here and request that such conditions may be made available for us also, as early as possible : - A- c/jzf e4&gt; jv/r/£,2_2s) 1) Existence of provident Fund Facilities. 2) Grant of full salary in case of sickness and accident with full enjoyment of available Hospitalization facilities. 3) provision of furnished quarters with all other facilities as afforded by the A,I # O.C# This would lead to encamp and concentrate us at one place. At the moment we are living in town scattered all over and far away from the place we work in; no protection being afforded us or our families in case of Air Raids. 4) Adoption of family allotment system, as done by A.I.O.C. 5) permission to draw on Company maintained Commissaries. This is most desirable and is surely important for Company's own interests. Scarcity of certain commodities is already felt in town and in case of need we have only to count upon the above source. 6) Payment of full leave earned even in case of resignation provided that the period of service is not less than one year. 7) Revision of Pays with a substantial increase. Govemment itself is offering positions on abnormal pays. A.I.O.C. has recently granted a general increase in salaries. Clerks here are comparatively poorly paid, some old a .I.O.C. Indian employees are receiving over rs .800/- p.m. whereas such figure is undreamt of here and denied to us. 8) War Allowance to be revised in line with A.I.O.C. 9) Revision in Temporary Living Allowance is desirable. To figure out this, it is requested that the Housing Facilities and other benefits afforded by the A.I.O.C. to its Clerical &amp; Technical employees, should be taken into consideration. Further, (and this is most important) in view of the fact that our position here is virtually the same as that of Clerks etc. attached to the Military, we beg to state that we stand eligible to the same benefits and privileges as enjoyed by them. Therefore the question of IMMEDIATE GRANT OF ADEQ]ijATE COMPENSATION OR PENSION to the dependants of an employee who dies or becomes incapacitated due to enemy action while here or on way to India/needs immediate consideration. We shall be much grateful if you will kindly give a most sympathetic consideration to the foregoing and help your loyal subjects who willingly stand up to your call. We beg to remain.

It ^ I seems to be a case of 'we are all very loyal but you have got to pay us for it' and in the candid opinion of the A.I.O.C's Manager personnel (Mr.McNeil) who has given 'U mc. permission to quote him, the Indian employees of the Bahrain Company are on a Jolly good wicket. Their terns compare very favourably indeed with those offered by the A.I.O.C. who by virtue of being a mach older company have much longer and more loyal service deserving of renumera- -tion than thftt Bahrain Company. Secondly cost of living in Iran especially this part is much higher than in Bahrain for reasons of difference in Customs duties if for none other. There seems no justification therefore for the terms of the Bahrain Oil Company to be precisely as good as those of the A.I.O.C. However in point of fact * ^ they are in all essentials as will be evident from the 4,^ \ , figures furnished by McNeil, with perhaps one exception, ^that of leave pay. The Bahrain Oil Company pay half pay on leave whereas the a. I.O.C . pay full pay. Lastly McNeil mentioned that he had taken a leaf from the Bahrain Company's Book namely We remarks at the penultimate paragraph of Lapp's letter to yoa uated j r ; , 11th March (marked 'A 1 by me) also Bahrain X^otice No.348-C and proposes to use/it in the A.I.O.C.

Sf^CxAL ALLv ANCS *C iflJbiSi xNCiJiiASKD ^.x V^N • His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, BAH k A IN. Dear Sir, 1 am attaching a Memorandum dated 10th March, 1942 with respect to the subject of a special allowance for non-staff employees to meet the increased cost of living, about which I have previously spoken to you. In addition, I am attaching confidential Exhibits of 1st January, 1942 as follows 8 - Sxhibit f, A n - Roster and wage data of Clerical and Technical employees. Exhibit 'B'- Roster and wage data of Artisan employees. Exhibit 'C 1 *- Roster and wage data of Domestic employees. I shall appreciate your treating the information contained in the three above exhibits, which discloses Individual salaries, as strictly confidential. We have been petitioned by our British Indian clerical and technical employees for an allowance to enable them to meet increased selling prices of the necessaries of life, which they point out have increased substantially in Bahrain and India. Neither the British Indian Artisan and Domestic employees nor the local employees (Bahrainis) have taken similar action. I mentioned this matter to Major Alban, who was in Bahrain before this petition was presented and he requested that he be kept informed of any such proposals contemplated, as such would affect the entire community. As Major Alban is no longer here I am presenting to you particulars of the wages paid employees of various categories by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., for your consideration, and suggest that other commercial concerns do likewise in order that in the event any action on the part of the employers is considered warranted, the allowance will be consistent and equitable for all concerned. It has been the practice of this Company to pay its employees a fair wage, sufficient to enable them to provide themselves with the necessities of life, and by adherring to a systematic saving programme, build a Provident Fund for use after retirement. The Company has, as evidenced by Exhibit I of the attached Memorandum, during the past three years progressively increased the wages of non-staff employees, enabling these people to withstand normal fluctuations in the selling prices of commodities. After your review of our present wage scale, in conjunction with salaries being paid in this community by other employers, we would appreciate your advising us if you consider the wages now being paid' to our local and Indian employees adequate. If not, any suggestions that you may have to offer will be carefully considered and presented to / oury -2- our Principals for their final decision. We have often found that after adjustments are made the merchants usually raise their prices and unless strict orice control measures are enforced, continual rises will follow. We feel, therefore, that such measures should be enforced, otherwise there appears to be no limit to prices that will be charged. This is a practice adopted with some success in other parts of the world. The cost of living has unquestionably increased and based on our surveys, this increase has been approximately 36% during the past year. This same condition apparently prevails substantially throughout the Near East, as evidenced by articles appearing in f, The Petroleum Times' of 15th November 194i, in which it is noted that the Labour Council in Haifa indicates the cost of living has risen 36%. Also, an article in the magazine 'Great Britain and the East' of 23rd October 1941 indicates that the cost of living has increased 40% in Egypt, as compared with the pre-war rate. In this connection, however, I am tabulating the average payments made various groups of employees in Bombay India, by Messrs. Caltex (India) Limited as compared with the average payments made by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited for similar employees 2 - Average Payments Per month ? B-AJTivA iN ; BuMBAY ; Clerical-Technical Rs 275 Rs 140 Artisans Rs 159 Rs 3 per day Domestics Ps 71 Rs 45 We are informed that in the Madras District, from which point a substantial number of our clerical employees were recruited, wages are about 10% lower than in the Bombay district. In considering this matter I should like to suggest that you bear in mind the inclination of the employee upon encountering increases in the cost of living is to appeal to his employer for increased wages or an allowance to meet the situation. In this instance, irrespective of whether an allowance is found warranted or not, I should like to point out that it seems unreasonable to expect industry to pay all the contingencies brought about by war time conditions as this is a burden that should be shared both by the employer and employee. I shall appreciate your reaction to this matter at your earliest convenience. Yours very truly, Sd. M.H.Lipp Chief Local Representative THE BAHRAIN ^EiKwLE M C^MPa t juxMhSD.

MEwOnANDuM 1. SuBJEJCx: Sx CxAL iV m EE x j ^IC xv K a SSD CoSx uF N r. INinv^IKjC x xuN ' The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, through the Company's Personnel Manager, have been petitioned by their British Indian Clerical and Technical employees for an allowance to enable them to meet increased cost of living due to abnormally increased prices for food and other necessities of life, which they indicate in their petition prevail not only In Bahrain but in India. In ^ this same petition these employees request the inauguration of a Provident Fund, which will be considered separately by the Company. This petition, dated 1st February, 1942, was signed by 99 out of a total of 115 employees ot the Clerical and Technical Group present in Bahrain at the time the petition was presented. There is no question but that selling prices of the necessities of life have in Bahrain increased substantially since the commencement of broadscale hostilities, and particularly since the spread of hostilities to South Asia and the East Indies. Therefore, the purpose of this Memorandum and attachments is to present the Company's position with respect to compensation paid and other amenities provided all non-staff employees for use in considering the subject and justification of a temporary allowance to enable the employee to withstand the increased cost of living. The earnings and amenities of the several groups of employees are being commented upon separately.

I SjcCON-180. - 2 - 4th August, 194: (2) - M Grant of full salary in case of sickness and accident with full enjoyment of available Hospitalization facilities. H In respect to the first issues of the above, the Company grants half-pay during time off account of sickness, the payment of the housing allowance is continued and there is no waiting period involved, nor is the period of sickness pay limited. However, in the case of non-industrial illness of a chronic or prolonged nature, the Company may terminate the employee's agreement and make such special sympathetic settlement with him as, at the discretion of the Management, is warranted. The Company grants half-pay and continues the payment of the housing allowance during time off duty account of industrial injury, which is substantially more than these employees would receive under the Workmen's Compensation Act of India. In the event of permanent total or partial disability, the Company is also guided by the Workmen's Compensation Act of India, in accordance with Clause 7 of the Company's Foreign Service Agreement for Indian employees, in determining the amount of compensation payable. (t t tc In regard to the last issue, adequate hospitalization facilities are provided these employees through the American Mission Hospital, at the Company's expense. (3) - 'Provision of furnished quarters with all other facilities as afforded by the A.I.O.C. This would lead to encamp concentrate us at one place. At the moment we are living in town scattered all over and far away from the place we work in; no protection being afforded us or our families in case of Air Baids.' The Company has assumed no responsibility for housing these employees, although they receive a temporary housing I allowance of Rs 35/- per month. The former allowance was Rs 25/- per month, which was increased to Rs 35/- in November, 1936. Approximately S5% of the employees of this group are either single or do not have their families in Bahrein. This affords them an opportunity of housing together and effecting a sub stantial saving in rents. I am informed a number of them take advantage of this opportunity and thus obtain housing at less than the allowance granted by the Company. These employees are furnished transportation to and from Manama at Company expense. In regard to air raid protection, I understand the Government of Bahrein some time ago launched upon an air raid protection programme. To encamp and concentrate these people in a location near the Company's area of operations would, I believe, intensify their risks of exposure to air raids for the Company's installations may be assumed to constitute an enemy target. It would therefore seem that these employees dispersed over Manama, as they claim, are thus less subject to risk of injury from air attack.• (W\ Ihf CON-180. - 3 - 4th August, 1942. (4) - 'Adoption of family allotment system, as do ne 'by A.I.0-C. H These employees are granted the privilege of currently purchasing rupee cheques on the Company's Bombay Bank account at par ^ and in this manner make such payments to their families as they elect from time to time. They are afforded 'banking facilities through the Eastern Bank Li mi ted, Bahrein. (5) - 'Permission to draw on Company maintained commissaries. This is most desirable and is surely important for Company's own interests. Scarcity of certain commodities is already felt in town and in case of need we have only to count on the ahove source.' They have not 'been granted permission to draw on the Company's limited supply of commissaries. The commodities that the Company endeavour to maintain are not ordinarily of the type consumed 'by this group of employee. You are familiar with the Company's attitude toward assisting in the maintenance of food supplies for Bahrein. This problem is receiving constant attention and the Company will welcome any suggestions you may have to offer. (6) - 'Payment of full leave earned, even in the case of resignation provided the period of service is not less than one year.' The Coorpany grants employees of the group under discussion, 2^ days of accumulative leave per completed month of service (provided the employee completes one year of current contract) at half-salary. If the employee returns with unbroken service he receives a further sum of money equivalent to one-half salary for the period of leave. At the discretion of the Management full leave pay may be granted in the case of resigning or terminated employees, according to the individual merits of the case. (7) - 'Revision of Pays with a substantial increase. Government itself is offering positions on abnormal pays. A.I.O.C. has recently granted a general increase in salaries. Clerks here are comparatively poorly paid. Some old A.I.O.C. Indian employees are receiving over Rs 800/- p.m. whereas such figure is undreamt of here and denied to us.' A comparison has been made of the Company's actuaj average wage rates as of 1st July, with the weighted average of the rates shown in the attachment to your letter for corresponding periods of service. The average and maximum wages paid by the Company compare with the weighted average and maximum of the rates mentioned under Item 7 of the attachment to your letter, which is as follows :- &gt;CON-180. - 4 - 4th August, /y j Service: PEE M 6 N i H Quoted Eates: Bapco Eates: Weighted Maximum: Average: Actual IwiAYi nrn-fti; Average: 1-3 years 3 - 6 years 6 - 9 years | 9 - 12 years Rs 210 Rs 220 fe 245 Rs 260 Rs 295 Rs 310 RS 340 Rs 355 Rs 207 Rs 275* Rs 245 Rs 345 Rs 272 Rs 345 Rs 332 Rs 400 * 1 Doctor @ te 350. The schedule or wage rates accompanying your letter appears to l^e a fixed schedule of rates related strictly to years of service up to 12 years. The Conrpany's policy is to grant wage increases on the 'basis of merit rather than on a fixea schedule related, to years of service, which permits an employee of the necessary capacity to, hy application to duty and meritorious work, obtain a salary considerably in excess of the maximum of the scale shown in the attachment to your letter, ior a given period of service. A number of the Company's employees of this group do receive salaries in excess of the maximum oi that shown in the fixed scale, while some receive less than the minimum because their work or their application to duty does not warrant more. (8) - 'War Allowance to be revised in line with A.I.0.C. M The Company's temporary War Allowance for this group of employees is Rs 25/-/- per month irrespective of salary. The object in making the grant a lump sum per month irrespective of salary was to benefit the lower paid worker and at the same time give the necessary measure of relief to the higher paid employee. The amount of the Company's war allowance was determined upon after a careful study of the increased cost of living in Bahrein prevailing at the time. The Company did not assume the obligation of keeping pace with further increases in living costs and thus assume all the burdens of war. It is only reasonable that the employee be prepared to accept part of this burden. The Company's allowance is lower than that mentioned in the attachment to your letter but I understand that the cost of living, particularly for foodstuffs, in Persia is considerably higher than in Bahrein. (9) - 'Revision of Temporary Living Allowance is desirable. To figure out this, it is requested that the Housing Facilities and other benefits afforded by the A.I.O.C. to its clerical and technical employees, should be taken into consideration.' Ite^^rence is made to a temporary living allowance, which I s rCON-180• - 5 - 4th August, 1942. is incorrect. The Company grants a temporary housing allowance, mentioned in my remarks under Item (3) ahove. Sr ^ In regard to the points mentioned in the penultimate paragraph of the petition of 25th May, it appears that the petitioners have placed an interpretation on the [Regulations that their position as employees of the Company places them virtually in the same category as clerics etc., attached to the Military, and that as such they stand eligible to the same 'benefits and privileges as enjoyed 'by the Military. If my ; j uixierstanding of Defence Hegulation No. 2 and your letter No. ~ of 8th May, 1942 is correct, this interpretation was neither implied nor intended. 'While 'benefits other than salary afforded 'by the Military may 'be more attractive than those of the Company, certainly the salaries paid 'by the Company for similar work are more attractive than those of the Military. The question of compensation for injuries or death resulting from enemy action has, in accordance with my letter Gon-62 dated 1st June, 1942, 'been referred to the aDpropriate 7 ,,. officers of the Company for consideration and I shall advise ryou immediately I am in receipt of their decision. . ( y r The foregoing deals with the Clerical and Technical group of employees from whom the petition was received, and does not include those employees classified as 'Artisans M . However, since in the attachment to your letter No. C/1117 the wage rates for Artisans was included, a comparison has 'been made of the * Company's actual average rate with a weighted average of the rate shown in the tabulations accompanying your letter. The Company's average as of July 1st was Rs 156 per month compared with Rs 155 per month up to Rs 200 per month. The Company's average wage rate for employees earning Rs 200 and over is Rs 236 as compared with a weighted average of Rs 225 per month. These employees receive a War Allowance of Rs 20 per month and are furnished free housing in camp, or Rs 20 per month in lieu of ^ housing for married employees with their families in Bahrein at Company permission.

I discussed the question with you at Bahrain last month and I understand that, while I was on recess, you discussed It further with Mr. Anderson and decided th©t, unless any of the signatories wished to pursue the matter and send a deputation to see me or unless, on detailed examination, I considered that there were sneclfic questions that required taking up with the Company, the ouestlon ml|tht be dropped.

The terms of service of the Bahrain Petrol eum Company 1 s clerical and technical employees do not, in general, compare unfavourably with those of their counterparts in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at Abadan, while the amenities of life at Bahrain considerably exceed those at Abadan.

At four o 1 clock yesterday afternoon when the J .efinery personnel were coming off work certain persons made representa tions th« t the men were not receiving an a Ic uate wa ;e. The ring leader appears to be Abdur Ualimr.n bin hohamied. Ir. ^arkurst who . as there asked persons who were in agreement \ ith /ibdur iiahfaan bin Lohaximed to step on one side. Jome 36 workmen did, and they \ ere told that they would be paid off and were ^iven paying off slips. Yesterday evening some 80 men failed to arrive for the mid night shift and the Company understand that Khamis bin Abdullah, 1 ohammed Jaleh bin ^brahim, and Lohammed bin Ali were endeavour ing to prevent Gil Company employees from .-joing out to work by talking to the men at the bus stands at I.aharracr and I'anama. j' bdur Rhaiimm bin I :ohammed went out to the Hefinery ^ates this morning and waf endeavouring to persuadG men not to f^c to work. 2. The present position is that roughly a hundred Refinery employees are absent from work ana the Company think it. possible that more may follow their example. The men affected appear to be in the higher paid divisions. • J:;. IJdD (1) To request the Bahrain Government to apprehend the four persons already named as endeavouring to prevent worters going to the Hefinery. (2) To request the Bahrain Government to have policemen on duty at the bus stands and in the buses to' prevent workmen bein^ molested on their way to work'. (3) That the Political Agent and the Adviser would go out to the Kefinery in the afternoon and talk to the outgoing men. 23rd December 1943. 3d. T.H. Political Agent, Bahraindtk§ OF . : : aj .. n . . : - ^ • The Auviser, jhoikh -Mi bin Ahmed of 'ifia'fa, and _ ,maz this morning to diocuss the poGition. Mr» Jard Lndevson informed me on the telephone that about were now 45C men/absent from work. The only pvoe effected so far is the Refinery. I'r. Anderson further stated that they were carrying on with difficulty but he hoped that they would be able vO continue to do so. 2. A petition was brought to me by one of the strikers (a copy of which had been :iven to the Adviser and, as 1 learnt later to lir# iknderson). i'he m&lt;m stated thf t the stril ers had s 1 ^ orn on the I oran that they would not return to their work until their demands \ had been ? : -reed to their satisfaction. 1 tol 1 him to advise the strikers to return to their work and assured him that their griev ances would be fully investigated. I also told him the* t he should return to his friends and advise them to meet the Adviser, shaikh Mi, who after the last labour troubles had been nominated to represent the grievances of the local labour to the Bahrain petro leum Company and myself at 10 o'clock Arabic. TT e left to convey our message to his fellow-workers. 3. V/e discussed the matter at length and Jhaikh Ali made it clear that he had known nothing whatever about the strike until mid-day yesterday. He, in our presence had asked the representative of the strikers why none of them had approached him and the man had replied that as he had been unable to satisfy certain of their grievances in the past they did not anticipate that he would be any more successful now. Both the Adviser and Shaikh Ali were very doubtful whether anyone would appear in the evening to meet us. 4. At 10 otclcck Arabic ihaikh Ali came to the Agency and shortly afterwards the representative of the strikers arrived alone. Ke said that they had refused to meet us. I told him again that I advised them to return to their work and assured him that their grievances would be fairly heard, but that if they would not cone /andand explain their troubles to us then they would scarcely as I had expect us to help them. low ever, /said 'before we v*/ould examine the j;rievences that had been riven to us in writing but they must return to their work, T inmediately ran^ up the Adviser who came over and we a^ain discussed the situation. o. I asked It. Anderson on the telephone to join us in our deliberations and as soon as ikx he arrived we ; r y ot him to state the position as far as his work was concerned. T 'e said that he would be able to carry on for 4 or 5 days without the men who were at present on strike provided no more went out; but it mi^ht mean shutting down some of subsidiary machinery at the Refinery. He said that he would like to make known to the men the benefit plans etc approval for which he had to-day received, and said that provided the men returned to their work their services would not be considered as broken by their present action. Both the Adviser and I myself v -ere opposed to this n line of action as we felt that it would be playing into the hands of the strike leaders. They would undoubtedly make capital out of it and v-e felt that were only be storing up struggle for the future by an immediate capitulation. It was aecided that His Highness should be asked to issue an 'Alan informing the people concerned that representations had been made to him, to the Political Agent and to the Company by certain of the Company employees who had left their work and those grievances would be fairly and immediately investigated, and that the men should return to their worV at once. It was further decided that ohaijih Ali should collect the peoole at Raa'fa who had left their work and endeavour to discover what their real difficulties were and persuade them to return but that he should not promise them an increase in wages. It was Shaikh Hi's opinion, and I understand that of trcu- the Adviser,.a certain number of the men would probably return within the next three or four days on their own accord owing to shortness 01 lunds to enable them to remain away from their /work\ CVlAf v^ork. It jmi also Shaikh Ali's opinion that the'Alan to bo issued by 'is Highness would have little effect. 7. Xt was my opinion that the representative who had •pp0 «r€&lt;t in the nornin^ had very probably consulted only three or four of the strkers who were influencing the* fmen and uhat the majority of -he men were unaware of our undertaking to investigate their complaints I also pointed out to the Adviser that whereas we both had machinery under which we could take action against persons inci^in^ labour to quit work with Bahrain Petroleum Company and whereas I had m. chi- nery to force British Subjects and British Protected Persons to remain at work in the said Company, the Bahrain vjovernment had no such machinery but that His Highness' 'Alan would provide them with a legal remedy should it become necessary later to take executive action against the strkers. 1 asked the Adviser if he would do his utmost to liscover who was behind the present riovement and in particular whether there was any truth in the rumour that some of the instigators were from outside the Company. Should our present action fail to solve the problem and brin» a sufficiency of men back to work it would be necessary to take executive action against persons instigating the men to remain away from work and at the same time allow the Company to make public the increases in War Allowance and the Benefit Plans which their Directors had approved. It was probable that the Company would not permit men still away from work when the Benefit Plan was made known to count the broken period of services as con tinuous service as they were at present willing to do for every body v^ho returns before they issued their announcement. It should be made clear that action against those instiga ting the present strike would be deciced upon as soon as the Adviser has been able to complete his enouiries, but our main object at that^ moment was to ^et the men back to work with out promises other than that already given, that ve would in vestigate their complaints, and vithout bringing the Refinery work to a standstill. (f % it is most unfortunate that the men have taken the action on their own at the present time as I feel sure that the increases /which ,, cwhich have now boon sanctioned by the Company Directors would have 15one a very lon^ way to satisfying their demands and although it would have been necessary to have Investigated certain minor grievances the chances are the strike would, never have occurred. There is a rumour that the strike has been engineered by disloyal persons and the Adviser is making a most thorough investi gation to discover whether there is truth in this rumour. i* 24-12-43.\C\v r^inu'^es of n meeting botwcen ITr, Belr.^n^/g, Mr. AnJerson (accompanied by Boekhuis) nnd nyself on the 28th of December 1943, at 11 a.m. Mr. Anderson st-tod th-1 certain of .his transport drivers had now gone on strike in sympathy with the strikers who had already come out. No appreciable number of labourers had returned to work since he last saw me and that he felt that he would like to make public the Benefit Plan and the Increases in 'far '\llowance. '/e discussed the question at some length and it was decided that subject to any alterations which might be necessary after I had seen His Highness in the afternoon the notification should be issued making public the V/ar Allowance Increases &amp;c». and to it should be appended a further notice by the General Manager of the Company on lines mutually agreed upon by us. A cony of this Notice*is attached to this note. 2. I said that I considered that I should have to reo^esent to His Highness the necessity for his taking strong action to induce employees to return should they still remain absent from work after the publication of the Benefit Plan, V/r.r Allowance Increases, oc. I informed Mr. Anderson and the Adviser that I propose to deal with this aspect of the case when I saw His Highness in the aiternoon and asked the Adviser to be present during my interview vith His Highness. 3. Mr. Anderson said that he would like to make it quite clear that he felt the Company was gravely at fault for not having brought the Benefit Plan, Increases in War Allowance, Ac., into effect well before the strike occurred. If however the employees ol the Company still persisted in their recalcitrant attitude after the notifications had been issued then it was a different matter and the blame,if so it can be called, would be on the employees and nou on the Management. Mr. Anderson also added that he was gravely concerned at the way the s^ike was takhg place as he felt that it was engineered by persons of some edu cation but he was absolutely at a loss to say who was at the back of it. (Ici) T.H. 28-12-43,msmmmmsa — * 3THIK SITUATION AS ON 28th D'SCIiTBEH 1943. The position to-day Is that some 600 employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company are on strike, ^he 'Refinery, the Tank Field, cer tain of the Transport Personnel, and the Jea Transport and Harbour Operatives at Sitrah are now involved. The Refinery has not yet stopped work but it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep the machinery functioning. 2. Mr. Anderson informed me this morning at a meeting at which the Adviser was present that he desired to make known immediately the new Benefit Plans and the increases in -'ar Allowance with certain reservations regarding those persons who were at present on strike. I drafted the notification addressed to the strikers which would be issued at the same time as the publication of the afore mentioned Benefit Plans, &amp;c. The notification was agreed to by Ttr. Anderson and the Adviser. A copy of this notification is attache'!. I have with reluctance agreed to this course of action as I dislike intensely giving in to people who are using force to obtain their ends but I feel that it is unfair to those persons who are remaining at their work to keep the Benefit Plans &amp;c., any longer secret, and I also fee) that the special notification with regard to the persons at present on strike will have an effect which will off set any feeling of elation on their part at achieving their ends. In the afternoon I went to Kaa^a and interviewed His Highness and at my request the Adviser was present. His Highness agreed to our suggestions but added that he would like to see the men paid for their Friday holiday. Both the Adviser and I considered this was reasonable as it appeared to us to be the normal practice that a workman should receive pay for his weekly holiday. I undertook to mention the matter to Mr. Anderson immediately after the termination of my interview with His Highness. His Highness pointed out to me that the Agency employees had received a 40% increase in pay and seemed anxious to compare our action with the Company's proposed increase of 20%. I pointed out to him that the 20^ increase by the Company would, owing to the higher basic pay of their employees, make the Agency and the Company almost exactly on a par as far as /wages i*/ wages and allowances were concerned. I pointed out to His Highness that the cessation of work at the Refinery would mean a serious falling off in the output and would adversely affect the supply of petrol for the Royrl Air Force. I also irew his attention to the fact that cessation of work at the Refinery would mean a decrease in loyalties paid to : ;is Highness. His Highness was at considerable pains lo explain that his views and mine were invariably coincident and that he was prepared to take any action which I might consider desirable. I drew his attention to the fact that it would be essential to been made aware of the Company's concessions, they take action against the strikers if, after having/remained away from work. In answer to His i.ighness 1 question with regard, 'oo v*hat acuion it could be taken I suggested that every person against whom there was oL the slightest suspicion of inciting or encouraging by aco, by vor, or by deed, the men to remain away from work should be arrested and that at the same time the Bahrain Government should take action to curtail the strikers' rations. It was agreed between us Lhat this action would be taken on Friday the 31st of December should the majority of the strikers not have returned by the evening ol the 3Gth» I received 'Lhe impression that the Adviser was not ent^usj-cisuxc about taking drastic action but I feel that it* must oe done and I believe that His Highness was in complete agreement. His Highness was at some pains to state that he was unable to discover the ring leaders although he ha&lt;u 01 ere : rewcirds for i . j Ca rnation, but he was convinced that they were to be found among the Persians an^. the Bahrana. I agreed with him. Afterj^aeetingwith His Highness I drove to the General Office of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and informed lir. Anderson x,hat the Shaikh had agreed to the publication of the ieneiit Mans, Increased Vtar Allowances, and the notification affecting the strikers, but, that His Highness was very anxious that pay should be given to the men for Fridays and that 1 considered his request to be reasonable and had tola him so. Ir. Anderson was non -plussed by this request and explainer to we that it would involve difficult accounting, a further increase of Ks.4/8/- a month for the lowest paid employees with correspondingly /higher@ ^ higher increases for the higher paid employees, possible diffi culty v;ith the California Arabian standard Gil Company i..ho did not pay for Friday work and other local employers. /e talkei the matter over for a considerable time and eventually it was decided that Jr. Anderson should consult his experts and see if there was any^by \/hich he could add a little more to the allow ances and couple it with the word Friday. I discovered that the notifications, &lt;fcc., had not been translated and offered to sen! two interpreters early the following morning to do the work as expeditiously as possible. I then returned to the Shaikh. I apquaintei the Shaikh with Lr. Anderson's difficulties regarding Friday pay and told him that we would do our utmost to find r, reasonable way round the obstacle but that it was a ques tion which could not be decided at a momenta's notice and that he would have to leave it in our hands for the present. T fis Highness ^uite understood the position and explained to me that he had not meant that every employee of the Company should receive pay on Fridays bux. only those who had an assured position and were and had been permanent employees for some time. His Highness made no mention of this view before my visit to Mr. Anaerson but that was not unnatural for there are bargaining instincts in even the hi^hestjin all eastern lands. After His Highness had made vrrious references to the unity of purpose of the British Government and the Bahrain Govern ment and himself and myself I was able to interrupt him and take leave, especially as it was some time after the call for evening prayer had sounded. . On the 1st January Ir. Anderson, the Chief Local Repre sentative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company informed me tr^at J practically all the strikers haa returned and^been reinstated without break in Service, and that the Company had decided to reward those who had remained at work and not joined in the strike by granting an ex-gratia payment equivalent to the old War Allowance.

Should they desire to return to work employment may be found for them and the M,- nagement will exercise their discretion with regard to re-inst ting them at their previous wage and consider whether to count their absence from duty as a break in service or not depending on the speed with which they return to duty.

My dear Anderson, There are still several outstanding points to be considered with regard to the demands made by certain of the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company during the recent strike. I have not yet been able to obtain a reply to my telegraphic enquiry from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company regarding payment by them for the weekly Friday holiday. I surgest that there should be a meeting with the Adviser on Tuesday morning, by v /hich time I trust the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company will have replied, to discuss the demands v /hich have not already been dealt with. If Tuesday is satisfactory to you I su^ gest that v/e should meet at 9-30 a.m. at the Agency. Yours sincerely Ward P.

Mr. T.JT, Beekhuis, The Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd. 1. ?he demands put forward by some of the Bahrain Petroleum * Company's employees during the recent strike were considered and it was decided that the Adviser would inform His Hijhness of the opinion of the meeting with ^e^ard to the specific points raiseo., r-ind if necessary a further meeting would take place with His Highness should His Highness so desiri . No. 1. The Tindal in Bapco should get.Rs.10/- per day. It was considered that the rates now being paid to Tindals were adequate and that it was impossible owing to the different grades, to fix a flat rate. ^. -in ordinary gauger or operator should at least get 7c,7/- per day. The rates for Gaugers, as for Tindals, were now determined on the capacity of the employee and whether or not he was a resident of Bahrain. It was generally agreed that residents of Bahrain should receive less than foreigners (Indians) who were entitled to extra emoluments for serving Overseas. The present rates were considered on the whole to be reasonable Labourers at any Plant should _et ~ .47- per day. Owing to the degrees of responsibility involved £;nd the indi vidual capacity of the workman employed no fl- t rate could be laid down and the present rates appeared reasonable. Pay should be given to the labourer for the Holiday either it is weekly Holiday or ,f x .ed ,f Holidays. (It ne-ns that a monthly salar^ should be ^iven.) The Company were prepared to employ all persons with more than one year 1 s service on a weekly basis at the same xx rate as they now received as daily ages. This will involve no actual increase in. pa^' but a change in the syste ! o^. payment. The Chief Loca?. Representative pointed out that should they Intro duce-introduce payment for the Friday holiday i 1 : ar o •■'i■ ^ : -- f further increase in the employees' erno'Luments 01 „ over -^,0 and it was agreed that this would not be justifiable - ! present tine. The basis woul^ have the adva ' a£^ 1 the v/orkers would receive 26 payments eah^ of which will be for a fortnightly period.instead of as at present 24 payments, of which were for the equivalent of a two-week penoc. arte c. ol which 'ere for the equivalent of a three-week period. No.5. All the labourers should be transferred to their living places such as it is done to Indians. The Chief Local Representative explained that there were two types of accommodation at present available at the Oil Field. For a certain number of the employees in permanent employ'nQn■ , buildings have been erected and for a certain number temporary structures have been taken over from the Army Authorities. These temporary structures haeut been built to house British troops. If the Conpany agreed to transfer the workers to the5r residences then no v/orker would live on the Company's premises and there would hot be sufficient motor transport available to convey therr to and from their work. It was also pointer out that a percentage of the workers resided in villages which were tiaccessi^le to ,o itor transport. It was considered that, Jtfovided the accommodation was reasonable,and there was no reason to assume that accommodation built for British troops vould not be sufficiently adequate for the inhabitants of Bahrain, the Company could not be expected the to do ! ore than what they -ere doing at^/present time. It was suggested that if His Highness had loubts about the adequacy of the accommodation a visit by him vould be welcomed by the Company. It was also clear that at the present tine it was /CL x uite impossible for the Company to embark on £ construction of permanent accommodation for several thousand employees. Ho.6. A year vacation should be one month per year. The- present \ cation picn|31st published by the Company soldered to be reasonable and that one month's vacation was very excessive. ATo.7. .3, No.7. Labourers should not be treated with cruelty or abused by Sahibs or des pised. The Chief Local Representative stated that he would deal ^ith this . Walker al - with employees. Ho.S. If any labourer happened to be injured during his work to the Company pay should be given to him in full. The new scheme promulgated by the Company allows for payment of full pay after a three-day waiting period and is more generous than that in the Indian Workmen 1 s Compensation ^ct. o r I\o. 3. If the labovir-Mr ^ot ill nd b is had ?. chit from the Doctor, half pay should be £-iven to him during his illness. The Company explained that as soon as it vas humanly possible they would introduce adequate medical facilities for all their employees. In the meantime they agreed to grant half p.y to employees of five years 1 service and more admitted to hospital for the period they remained in the hospital. No. 10. In accordance to 'far Proble i the labourer Ilov /ance, nd according to his pay. The Company have already granted a 20 increase. Ko. 11. .^ny fresh notice about ration Ox j ny other reason issued to the Indians should be issued to the 3 rd Class. It was agreed that all notices would be made public to all employees. ITo. 12. Fining the labourer for trifling mistakes should be stopped. - The recom mendation th it an e ^lovee should be f * ■ ^ust be approved by the Refinery Manager in consultation with the Personnel Lanagef. The Chief Local Representative sail thet sons that employees! he would make personal enquiries into this system in particular with reg; rd to allegations nade by certain pers were fined for losing rags. The above deta ils should not they stand perpetually, for to r^e en^ \ge l . be temporary, but workers engaged nd It was agreed that ihx no such undertaking could be given.(3 ~ Cor puny should cor ^o-'ly anac r .ce the Public as well as to the labourers all the above details whether they are accept i' 1j or not. T Vi is 1 s ; Iready been de^lt vith. No.15. Refusal of all labourers are caused especially by the folloiving items;- 1. rise growing in expenses. 2. Cruelty used in tr ^t 'ng the Id bo 1 ^ ■ .

All of the above were released to the employees December 29, 1943. I now enclose ten copies each in English of the Company's Vacation Plan for the Rupee Payroll employees serving on foreign Service Agreements and in English and Arabic of the Company's Vacation Plan for those not serving on Foreign Service Agreements. These Vacation plans were released to the employees December 9, L943 but were not previously forwarded you as I wished to^have both English and Arabic copies completed before transmitting. Confirming our conversation, the Company has contemplateo. the inclusion of a Non-Industrial Sickness and Acciaent leature in its benefit plans for these employees. However, due to present 'conditions and the shortage of facilities, drugs and adequate means of control, it is considered necessary to deler such a feature until a later date. Accordingly, the Company will continue to follow its present practice of providing free medical treatment to i^ 3 ^ smployees through Company dispensaries at Awali and the Relinexy and through its support of the Mission provide foi treaoment and hospitalization for certain diseases to the extent permitted oy the Mission's facilities.

It seems that the company made no promise of any description to provide provisions at -reasonable rates. However, they are doing their best to obtain supplies of provisions from India or America for sale to their Indian artizans and other Indian employees. The accommodation problem does not seom to call for action as they were Informed before they Joined that they would have to share rooms. Tha treatment by their sup:rtors does, according to Mr. Nichols, leave a good deal to be desired and he assures me that he has on more than one occasion issued directives to tha B*M.P. Corporation on this point. He is nor informing the artizans that they should bring to the Managements notice every individual case of ill treatment. The drinking water position has now been put right and water is available on the plant, jfo one is satisfied with the Dearness Allowance and the Company are | replying that they will increase and decrease in accordance with v the rise and fall in prices. ?&gt;• The Poisoning case I spoke to Mr. Hichols today with regard to this case and told him that having read the evidence I felt that if I had the trying magistrate I would not have found it possible to acquit * the compounder. ' I pointed out that as regards the medical officer who was accused although there was no doubt that he was correctly discharged by the magistrate trying the case there was also no doul that had he been practising In tho West he would have been subject to disciplinary action by the Qoneral Medical council for p.rmlttli . an unskilled dispenser to dispense his prescription*. I told the Company that I considered that there have been grave neglect and tl I considered that they will be well advised in taking in future more interest in the medical side and ensure that their compounder were qualified. With regard to the removal of the poisons fter the police had taken action I suggest that in future it would be far better for than to leave things alone or their motives might be misconstnBr. Sioliols statfid that in fact Dr. McAllister removed the drugs by the direct orders of Mr. ward Anderson who irritated and alanced at what had already occurred desired to ensure that there was no further opportunity for negligence and directed the poisons to lis locked up forthwith^ 22nd October 1944. ^p j* 0 s f^n o * ~ Major T.

At four o 1 clock yesterday afternoon when the Refinery personnel were coming off work certain persons made represent- j; ations that the men were not receiving an adequate wage. The ring leader appears to be Abdur Rahman bin Ilohammed. Mr. Barkhurst who was there asked persons who were in agreement v/ith Abdur Rahman bin Mohammed to step on one side. Some 36 | workmen did, and they were told that they would be paid off and were given paying off slips. Yesterday evening some 80 men failed to arrive for the midnight shift and the Company understand that Khamis bin Abdullah, Mohammed Saleh bin Ebrahim, and Mohammed bin Ali were endeavouring to prevent Oil Company employees from going out to work by talking to the men at the bus stands at Maharraq and Manama. Abdur Rahman bin Moharrmed went out to the Refinery ates this morning and v/as endeavouring to persuade men not o go to work. 2. The present position is that roughly a hundred Refinery employees are absent from work and the Company think it possible hat more may follow their example. The men affected appear o be in the higher paid divisions. Decided:- (1). To request the Bahrain Government to apprehend the four persons already named a^ endeavouring to prevent workers going to the Refinery. (2) To request the Bahrain Government to have policemen on duty at the bus stands and in the buses to prevent workmen being molested on their way to work. (3) That the Political Agent and the Adviser would go out to the Fefinery in the afternoon and talk to the outgoing men. s w 23rd December 1943.

It was probable that the Company would not permit men still away from work when the Benefit Plan was made known ^rvl rirh? ivr 1 to count the broken period of service as conti nuous service as they were at present willing to do for everybody who returns before they issued their announcement. r /tt should be made clear that action against those instigating the present strike wil-i be decided upon as soon as the Adviser has been able to complete his enquiries, but our main object A*** at,the moment •larto get the men back to work without promises other than that already given, that we would investigate their complaints, and without bringing the Refinery work to a standstill, 9// It is most unfortunate that the men have taken the /1 A ^ / -4- action on their own at the present tifee as I r^^-L r ^ ^ that the increases which have now been sanctioned by the Company Directors would have f^one a very 1 V satisfying their demands and although it would oe-n necessary to have investigated certain minor ^rievan^s the chances are the strike would never have occurred. /o There is a rumour that the strike has been engineered b ^persons ^vhn ar^disloy^) +j(ii ^uilt and the i^ivis ei - making a most thorough investigation,whether there is (Lu**. truth in' this rumour, -wi If ^n ^fpsruig rfi^n no MlTtLii 1 &gt;—acfeinn.muy 'u .taken to ma^o it impoppfblo tl.rni -t-n i rryr-' , 24-12-43.16/1- G. ^ l .

( It means that a monthly Salary should be ^iven) All the labourers should be transferred to their livinn* Places such as it done to Indians.

P.A Bapco employees strike was the main topic of the week; this event formnd the subject of talk in the bazars, majlises, coffee-sho^s, bookshops, street corners and^othe^ pulDlic places. People speak of various stories relating to the cause of this strike and the way it was prepared and carried out. Some of them say that the manager of the new B.r.P.'Refiner on finding employees here are paid very small wap :es, ^ p:ot^ in touch with the manager of Bapco and discussed with him t e possibility of increasing the wages of the employees of the ^ new 'Refinery and that the manager of Bapco did not concur with this p^opos^l as it would have a bad reaction on Banco employ —&gt; who will come forward with demands for similar increased wages. That the manager of B. TT .P., thereupon, went and instir^tod the employees of Bapco Refinery to open a strike. Others s-&gt; that one of the Refinery employees was discharged from service ^nd that 21 others objected to t o is ac ^ion and declared a strike. As soon as the rest of the employees who were off duty henrd of this they also declared a strike ; these -ere followed by othe^. until their number exceeded 500 men(200 them are said to be coolies and the rest gangpu^hers, gauffers etc). A third storv says that this str-ike was decided upon some time ago as the employees found it very difficult to^make both ends meet at the present rate of wages they are getting and thus planned to ^o on strike as they considered presenting representations would not be fruitful. It is said that ail concerned swore that their ■ -ord will be one and that they would not tell who their ringleaders are so that they should not be in trouble. A rumour prevails that one of the strikers submitted a letter to the P.A.on Friday last(24 .12 .45) containing their demands which are as follows:- 'he daily wages of a gan^pusher should be Rs,9 and a ganger Rs.- and a coolie Rs.3, that all employees are to be granted 1 month T s leave after completing one year T s s Q rvice and that they should be provided with free transnorts. It is rumoured too that Awali Camp and B .r .P. employees will go on a strike. The well-to-do strikers contributed between themselves a sum of Rs .200 to be ffiven to their poorer comrades forjsheir maintenance during the neriod they are on strike. It is said that they will not go back to work unless they are given definite promises that their demands will be granted and .hat they do not consider the Alan issued by the Bahrain Government as a sufficient guarantee that they demands will be granted.Telegram B Polltlcnl ^nhrnln To Political Resident, Bashi r&gt; e No. sry Dated 27th December 1943.

Somerville. After compliments: We the drivers of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited consider it an honour to work under you and we are quite alive and thankful to you for your kind affection and forbearance for us during all this period of our service. Sir, When we find our colleagues and friends the workers in the Refinery ha^e gone on strike for reasons of grievances some of which are common to us also you will appreciate our feeling of shame to go on working and drawing pay when they are out of work being forced to go on strike. We have therefore decided, as 3om today, to go on strike as they are. We feel that we are only discharging our duty in taking this step which we consider auspicious. We have taken oath on the Koran that we will not return to our jobs in the Company until those labourers on strike have returned. This is our final word. Je also like to draw your attention to the fact that if they Company think; of discussing the question with us conditionally concerning us separately we beg to inform you that there will be no chance. Our conditions are the same as those submitted by our respected friends, the workers in the Refinery, We pray to God to solve this problem and allow the water to take its course as soon as possible. We have no doubt you will appreciate and support our point of view considerately.

Mr. Anderson also added that he was gravely concerned at the way the strike was taking place as he felt that it was engineered by persons of some education but he was absolutely at a loss to say who at th^ back of it. 28-12-43. P.T.O.Y Persons who are at present absent from their employ- ment without the permission of the Bahrain Petroleum Company will be considered to have terminated their ser vices with the Company. Should they desire to return to work employment may be found for them and the Management will exercise their discretion with regard to re-instatir them at their previous wage and consider whether to count their absence from duty as a break in service or not depending on the speed with which they return to duty. In no event will the Company be prepared to pay these persons wages and allowances for the day. that the} have been absent from duty.

It is true that the men have a genuine grievance but they did not make any request to the Company nor did they appeal to the Bahrain government or myself before striding. The Company received sanction to the war allowance and other benefit plans the day after the strike commenced. I considered that to accede immediately to the men's demands would encourage their leaders to advocate similar action again at a later date with possibly less provocation. The men would never believe that the plans had been under consideration for some months.. 3. As already reported the wages increases etc. were made public yesterday evening and in addition and at my suggestion the minimum basic coolie wage and allowance has been raised to Rs.39-4as. plus Rs.2/- ration credit a month. This I consider reasonable at present but an increase may be necessary later. 4. Certain of the men have already returned to work this morning although the effect of the notice cannot yet have been felt.

Both these men were discharged in February this year in connection with the theft of rice from ship^ stores at Sitra Pier, where they worked. Yousuf was re hired in September this year as, in our opinion he was being used as a tool by Khalifa, who exerted considerable influence on the other members of the Sitra Marine Gang of which he was the Tindal. , v e had suspected Khalifa for some years of being the main cause of several subversive actions in the marine gang and the disappearance of many items of Company property, ^e pass this to you for your information and any action you may deem necessary.

Mr, Anderson was non plussed by this request and explained to me that it would involve difficult accounting, a further increase of M.4/8/- for the lowest paid employees with correspondingly higher increases for the higher paid employees, possible difficulty with the California Arabian Standard Oil rromoany who did not pay for Friday work^ ana other^employers le&lt;7flly, T 7e talked the matter over for a considerable time and eventually it was ct'.cL deci&amp;^f that Ir. Anderson should consult his experts and see if there was any way by which he could add a little more to allowances and couple it with the an ma rri Friday. I dis covered that the notifications, &amp;c., had not been translated and offered to send two interpreters early the following morning to do the work as expeditiously as nossible. I then returned to the Shaikh. I acquainted the Shaikh with I»ir.

His Highness quite understood the position and exnlained to me that he had not meant that every emoloyee of the Company shoulc receive pay on Fridays but only those who had an assured position and were and had been permanent employees for some time.

We have therefore decided, as 3oa today, to go on strike as they are. We feel that we are only discharging our duty in taking this step which we considnr auspicious. We have taken oath on the Koran that we will not return to our jobs in the Company until those labourers on strike have returned. This is our final word. tfe also like to draw your attention to the fact that if they Company think of discussing the question with us conditionally concerning us separately we beg to inform you that there will be no chance. 6ur conditions are the same as those submitted by our respected friends, the workers in the Refinery. tfte pray to God to sol\c this problem and allow the water to take its course as soon as possible.

In regard to paragraph 2, TT r. Lipp spoke to me three or four days ago in regard to an application from the Indian employees of Bapco asking -that, in view of the rise in the cost of food, they should be given a rise in pay. llr. Lipp realised that a) the rise in the cost of food affected equally, or almost equally, Bahraini employees of the Company and (b) that if 'Rapco ^ave a rise in pay to their Indian and Bahraini employees other employers of labour in the Island, e.g. Gray Mackenzie, P.C.L. etc. Vv'ould be affected. He suggested that the P.A. should call a meeting of representatives of Companies employing local labour and that the whole question should be dis- cussedat such a meeting in order that parallel action I might be taken by all concerned at the same time. 1 , agreed provisionally to this suggestion but said that, before a meiting was called, it would be necessary to obtain certain data, e.g. the amount of/rise in cost of foodstuffs,^/rates of pay prior to the war and now. Mr. Lipp is collecting thfjft data and will let me have r[J living, Mr. Crow is also sending another copy of Bnclosare C (confidential) to Company's letter of 11th March. P.R. suggested that l' should send a written reply to the Company's letter saying that I was unable to give them advice regarding the amount of increase to be given to their Indian or local employees but that (subject to consultation with Mr. Belgrave) I should agree to convene a conference of persons concerned with rates of labour. By co-ordinated action among all employers of labour it might be possible to avoid agitation by employees of any one concern. I explained to the conference that food prices in Bahrain were strictly controlled but that the level of such prices depended inevitably on the level of prices in India; and that I obviously could not exercise any influence over Indian prices. I informed Mr. Lipp that from the information at my disposal (i.e. statement of food prices furnished by Food Con troller on 11th March) the cost of foodstuffs had risen approx imately 100 % since the 1st September 1939. In the Company's letter dated 11th March they say the cost of living has increas ed approximately 36 % during the past year. These figures . * — ■ '— could probably be reconciled. /) 17/3/42.

These measures ares- (a) The introduction of a Gratuity, Death, and Disability Benefit Plan applicable to all employees of the Company whose salaries are paid in Rupees. (b) The reconsideration of the vacation plan. (c) The reconsideration of the present rates of War Allowance. U) Gratuity t Death T and Disability Benefit Plan. A draft oi the proposed plan was handed to me by the Chief Local Representative and is on record in the Office. (Political Resident to be informed). (b) Vac ation Plnn . The Chief Local Representative stated that he would let me have a copy of their scheme as soon as one can be typed. (c) War Allowance. The Company proposed to give all their employees who are in receipt oi more than Rs.1/8/- a day a 20# War Allowance. In addition they proposed to make a Rs.15/- increase in House Rent Allowance and to raise the discount on rations sold from the Company stores from Rs.2/- a month to Rs.S/- a month. But this last increase would not be applicable to unskilled labour. At present the Company pay unskilled labour a War Allowanx of r 5.8/- a month, artisan labour Rs.20/- a month, and clerical labour Rs.26/- a month, irrespective of the individual's emolu ments. Unskilled labour drawing Rs.i/8/- or less a day will receive no increase but will continue to draw their Rs.8/- a month War Allowance, nor would unskilled labour be entitled to II'! IB the extra Re .l/- benefit on rations supplied by the Company, i.e., they will still continue to receive R3.2/- a month rebate. The Chief Local Representative pointed out and produced statements to show that the increase suggested without the houst rent increase would place their artisans and clerical labour on much the same level as the employees of this Agency and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. I said that I thought that the scheme as a whole was very xaiixfaRiaKy reasonable but I felt that it would be unwise to give too big a grant all at once and I suggested that the house rent increase eould be held in abeyance for the time being so that it could be produced at a later date in the event of a further increase in the employees 1 emoluments being rendered necessary by further increases in the cost of living. I said that the question of rent control was under serious consideration and that I hoped that in a very short time we will be able to produce a satisfactory law which should not only control future increases but in many cases result in a reduction in the present high ^ents. I also pointed out thai the people who were really sufferers i'rom the rise in prices were the people on the lowest rates of pay and their sufferings were likely to increase very considerably in the near future ^ jeffidtKG ocusite ca&amp;iftdrad s would advocated that the unskilled labour drawing Rs.1/8/- downwards should have an increase in their War Allowance and the Chief Local Representative said that he would be prepared to recommend to his directors that their War Allowance was increased from Rs.8/- to Rs.10/- a month. I told Mr. Anderson that I would discuss the matter with the Political Resident, and he stated that he would now get in touch with his directors with a view to bringing his schemes into operation as quickly as possible. 1. /A - 8-12-43.
