NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT, 1946 Persons Abroad on 5tli July, 1048 JUNE, 1948 MINISTRY OF NATIONAL INSURANCENATIONAL INSURANCE ACT, 1946 IMPORTANT The information given in this leaflet is based on Draft Regulations which have been submitted to and published by the National Insurance Advisory Committee, but still require to be laid before Parliament. Until that action has been completed the information must be regarded as provisional and subject to alteration. Persons Abroad on •till July, 1048 This leaflet is intended for people who, though outside Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man when the National Insurance Scheme starts on 5th July, 1948, have lived in Great Britain or the Isle of Man. It is not for people in the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom or employed in British merchant ships or aircraft. They, and people abroad only for a few weeks, should first read para. 6. There are special rules for married women, explained in para. 14. Paras. 1-4 give a very brief description of the National Insurance Scheme. Fuller information is contained in the “Family Guide ;o the National Insurance Scheme” which can be obtained from the Ministry of National Insurance at the address given below. Paras. 5-!4 deal with the special position of people abroad at 5th July 10/10 * r Fara. 18 is lor employers who have employees abroad. There is a separate leaflet (N.I. 38) for people going abroad on or after 5th July, 1948. The Industrial Injuries Insurance Scheme comes into operation on 5th July, 1948 (the same date as the National Insurance Scheme), but it applies only to illnesses and accidents occurring in Great Britain, and its benefits are not dependent on payment of contributions. People abroad who want further information or advice should write tot— MINISTRY OF NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS, NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, ENGLAND.3 The National Insurance Scheme 1. The new National Insurance Scheme which comes into operation on 5th July, 1948, covers, with few exceptions, everyone (other than certain married women) between the ages of 15 and 65 (60 for women) then in Great Britain. As there are parallel schemes in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man which are linked with the Great Britain scheme by reciprocal arrangement, this leaflet is not applicable to any person who is in Northern Ireland or the Isle of Man on 5th July, 1948. Such a person will be covered by the provisions of the Northern Ireland scheme, or of the Manx scheme. But the Manx scheme is so nearly identical with that of Great Britain, that this leaflet may be taken to apply to people who have gone abroad from the Isle of Man. There are three classes of insured persons, who pay different rates of contributions according to their class and who become eligible for benefits appropriate to that class (see paras. 2 and 3). The three classes are:— Class 1 (Employed Persons). Those who work for an employer under a contract of service or are paid apprentices. Most people who work for wages or salary are in this class. Class 2 (Self-Employed Persons). Those in business on their own account, and others who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an employer. Class 3 (Non-Employed Persons). All insured persons who are not in Class 1 or Class 2. Dependent on these contributions are rights to the cash benefits described in para. 3. Rights earned by contributions to the old National Health, Contributory Pensions and Unemployment Insurance Schemes are not lost. Such contributions help towards qualification for benefit under the new scheme, and any Widow’s, Orphan’s or Old Age Pension already being paid under the Contributory Pensions scheme at 4th July, 1948, will continue to be paid from 5th July, 1948, at the same rate, unless the beneficiary qualifies for benefit at a higher rate under the new National Insurance Scheme. Hates of Contribution 2. The main rates of weekly contribution are:— Class 1 Employed Persons Class 2 Self- Employed Persons s. d. Class 3 Non- Employed Persons s. d. Paid by Employee s. d. Paid by Employer s. d. Total s. d. Men aged 18 and over 4 7 3 10 8 5 6 2 4 8 Men under 18 2 8 2 3 4 11 3 7 2 9 Women aged 18 and over 3 7 3 0 6 7 5 1 3 8 Women under 18 2 2 1 9 3 11 3 1 2 3Class 1 contributions give title to all benefits (see para. 3). Class 2 contributions give title to all benefits except Unemployment Benefit. Class 3 contributions give title to all benefits except Unemployment and Sickness benefits and Maternity Allowance (see para. 4). Employed Persons in Great Britain and their employers also contribute to Industrial Injuries Insurance, but such contributions are not payable when the employee is abroad. Hates of Benefit 3. The right to benefit is dependent on contributions paid, and on other conditions. The normal rates of the main benefits are shown in the table below, but they are subject to variations and conditions which are explained in other leaflets in this series (see Appendix for list of leaflets). Type of Benefit Normal rate Increase for First Child Increase for Wife or other adult dependent Mainly dependent on Unemployment Benefit 26/- a week 7/6 a week 16/- a week recent Class 1 contribu tions Sickness Benefit 26/- a week 7/6 a week 16/- a week recent Class 1 or 2 contributions Widow’s Benefit see para. 4 7/6 a week — husband’s long-term Class 1, 2 or 3 con tribution record Maternity Benefit see para. 4 — — the father’s or mother’s recent Class 1, 2 or 3 , contributions Guardian’s Allowance for Orphans 12/- a week — — either parent having been insured Retirement Pension 26/- a week 7/6 a week 16/- a week long-term Class 1, 2 or 3 contribution record Death Grant Up to £20 Class 1, 2 or 3 con tribution record of de ceased or deceased’s wife, husband or parent Generally no two benefits can be drawn at the same time in respect of the same person (e.g., a man cannot get an increase in respect of his wife if she is drawing benefit on her own insurance).5 Widow’s Benefit, after the first 13 weeks (other than a 10s. pension under the old Contributory Pension Scheme) and Retirement Benefit while the beneficiary is under 70 (65 for a woman) are reduced by Is. a week for every shilling of earnings above 30s. (widows) or 20s. (retirement). Some Facts about Benefit 4. Widow’s Benefit is of three kinds. For 13 weeks from her husband’s death, a widow may receive Widow’s Allowance of_36s. a week which may be increased by 7s. 6d. a week, if she has a child under school leaving age. After the 13 weeks she may receive 33s. 6d. a week (Widowed Mother’s Allowance) as long as she has a child under school leaving age. Finally she may get a pension (normally 26s. a week) for life, if— (a) when her Widow’s Allowance ends, she is over 50 and had at her husband’s death been married 10 years, or (b) when her Widowed Mother’s Allowance ends, she is over 40 and 10 years have elapsed since the date of her marriage, or (c) when her title to Widow’s Benefit would otherwise cease, she is incapable of supporting herself, and continues to be so incapable. Widow’s Benefit is not payable after remarriage. Maternity Benefit is also of three kinds. A Maternity Grant of £4 is payable in respect of the birth of a child. In addition to the Maternity Grant a woman normally working outside her home duties otherwise than for or in partnership with her husband, may get Maternity Allowance of 36s. a week for 13 weeks. Women not entitled to Maternity Allowance may receive Attendance Allowance of 20s. a week for four weeks in addition to Maternity Grant. The special position of married women is recognised under the scheme. For the most part their needs are covered by their husband’s insurance. Married women (and widows receiving benefit other than a pension under the old Contributory Pensions Scheme) are therefore excused, if they wish, from paying contributions, and in some cases they are compulsorily excluded from insurance. If they are insured, the benefits available to them on their own insurance are in some cases less than the normal rates. Retirement Pension is payable at the age of 65 (60 for women) subject to retirement from regular employment. It may be increased by postponing retirement, but at the age of 70 (65 for women) retirement is assumed in any case. There are special conditions for people who are over the age of 55 (50 for women) when the scheme starts on 5th July, 1948. If they last entered insurance (under the old Contributory Pensions Scheme) before 30th September, 1946, they cannot qualify for pension until five years after the date of entry. If they last entered on or after 30th September, 1946, they cannot qualify until 10 years after entry. An insured person reaching 65 (60 for a woman) before he has completed the 10 (or five) years of insurance necessary to qualify for a retirement pension can choose either to go oncontributing for the remainder of the qualifying period or to stop contributing and apply for a refund with interest of that part of each contribution paid for weeks after 5th July, 1948, which relates to retirement pension. There are two leaflets (N.I. 15 and N.I. 28) about Retirement Pensions {see Appendix). Benefit is not paid in respect of Unemployment, Sickness and Death occurring outside Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, except that Sickness Benefit may be paid during the first six months of residence in the Channel Islands. Widow’s Benefit and Retirement Pension are payable in the British Commonwealth and Empire ; but Widowed Mother’s Allowance, Guardian’s Allowance and increase of Widow’s Allowance or Retirement Pension in respect of a child are not payable while the child concerned is absent from Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, except in some cases where the absence is only temporary. Maternity Grant and Attendance Allowance (but not Maternity Allowance) are payable for a confinement occurring anywhere, if the mother is ordinarily resident in Great Britain; but they can be paid only in Great Britain, either to the mother on her return or to some other person, whom she nominates. One of the conditions for entitlement to the full rate of Widow’s Benefit and Retirement Pension is that the average number of contributions paid or credited* each year must be not less than 50. This average is calculated over a period extending to the year when the claim to benefit arises from one of the following times:— {a) from 1936—for those who last entered insurance in 1936 or before, {b) from the year of last entry into insurance—for those who entered after 1936 but before 5th July, 1948, (c) from 1948—for those who, being over 16 on 5th July, 1948, enter insurance on or after that date, (&lt;/) from the year when they reach the age of 16—for those who, being under 16 on 5th July, 1948, enter insurance after that date. Where the average falls below 50, the rate of benefit is reduced. Provision is made in the National Insurance Act permitting arrangements to be made with the government of any British Dominion or Colony or foreign country to link by reciprocal arrangements the insurance scheme of that country with the National Insurance Scheme of Great Britain. Should such arrangements be made, the position of persons insured under the National Insurance Scheme of Great Britain, who are in one of the countries concerned, would no longer be as described in this leaflet. In particular it is likely that under such reciprocal arrangements contributions paid to the National Insurance fund of Great Britain would count towards benefit under the insurance scheme of the other country, and vice versa. At the time of preparation of this leaflet such reciprocal arrangement had been made only with Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. 1 j c • ' ... aui uau um iiimiicu person rnii \ ^ eX ^ U u d ,£T.T,, P r ay '?g a contnbut ‘° n for a particular week, and be “credited” with a contribution which was^xcused^ ^ purpose of future entitlement to benefit, as if he had paid the contributior‘ Persons Abroad 5. Except in the case of some people who have gone overseas to work for an employer who has a place of business in Great Britain (paras. 8 and 9), no-one is required to pay contributions while abroad. But in some cases people abroad may, if they wish, contribute (paras. 8 to 12), and it may be of advantage to do so in order to build up or preserve right to benefit. Some of those who are not allowed to contribute at once will be given a chance to establish their position on return to Great Britain (para. 13). In considering your own position:— (a) if you are a married woman, read para. 14; (Jb) if you are over 55 (or 50 for a woman), you should take into account , the rules about Retirement Pension in para. 4; (c) if you are likely to spend all or most of your life abroad, you should bear in mind which of the benefits are payable outside Great Britain, and where they are payable (para. 4). Apart from these special points your position depends mainly on:— {d) your previous residence in Great Britain; (e) how long you have been abroad; (/) whether you have been insured under the old schemes—National Health, Contributory Pensions and Unemployment Insurance; (g) whether you are employed by an employer with a place of business in Great Britain, and whether you entered his employment immediately following employment by an employer in Great Britain. Your nationality does not matter. Some People Abroad Aeed Do A o thing 6. If you are in the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom (including the Women’s Services), or serving on a British merchant ship or aircraft, your position is being looked after, and there is nothing you need do unless you are asked by your employer. If you are abroad only for a few weeks which happen to include 5th July, 1948, you may have registered under the Scheme before you left Great Britain. If not, or if you are in any doubt about your position, you should call at any local National Insurance Office for advice as soon as possible after your return. If you are a married woman, not already insured (see para. 14) and not working for an employer with a place of business in Great Britain, you cannot be insured under the scheme until you return to Great Britain and take up a gainful occupation. If you have never been resident in Great Britain you cannot be insured while you remain outside Great Britain. If your residence in Great Britain was less than a continuous period of at least three years, and you were not insured under the old National Health or Contributory Pensions Scheme, you cannot be insured unless you are working for an employer with a place of business in Great Britain, and you were working for an employer in Great Britain immediately before going abroad. 7R Some Must and Some May Contribute 7. If your case is not dealt with in para. 6 you will perhaps find that you are covered by one of the next four paragraphs (8 to 11) and that either you must contribute (through your employer), or you may contribute (paying yourself). If your employer is due to contribute on your behalf, you need do nothing. Para. 18 explains what he must do. If in doubt, get in touch with him. If you find that you are in the class who may contribute, read para. 17 which describes how to pay, and para. 15 which explains how to notify the Ministry of your decision to pay. The address of the branch of the Ministry looking after overseas contributors is Ministry of National Insurance, Contributions, Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, and all enquiries should be sent to that address. Have You been Compulsorily insured while Abroad? 8. You are insured under the new National Insurance Scheme if you were at 4th July, 1948, contributing in Group I War Occupation*, or if you have at any time since 5th July, 1942, paid contributions under the Unemployment Insurance (Employment outside the United Kingdom) Regulations, 1936, and remain at 5th July, 1948, in the same employment. ' (If you have been compulsorily contributing under the old Schemes of Health, Pensions or Unemployment Insurance you must have been in one of these classes.) If you went abroad before 5th July, 1947, you may pay Class 3 contribu tions from 5th July, 1948. If you went abroad on or after 5th July, 1947, your employer should pay Class 1 contributions in respect of you until you have completed a year abroad, or cease to be in the employment; thereafter you may pay Class 3 contributions. In either case such contributions, if paid regularly, will count for all benefits when you return to Great Britain, just as if they were Class 1 contributions paid in Great Britain. While your employer is paying contributions for you, he can deduct your share {see para. 2) from your pay. Did You Ho Abroad to a Job ? 9. If (a) you went abroad to a job (not covered by para. 8) between 1st January, 1946, and 4th July, 1948, and (b) you were working for an employer in the United Kingdom immediately before you went, and * A Group I War Occupation means employment abroad (but not in Eire) in a civilian capacity by the Admiralty, Army Council or Air Council or other Government Department, or by N.A.A.F.I. or by a Works Contractor to the Admiralty, Army Council or Air Council, or by a voluntary organisation engaged in hospital, ambulance, relief, rehabilitation or canteen work, or by U.N.R.R.A. provided that the employer resides or has his principal place of business in Great Britain, and that the employee was in Great Britain and insured for Unemployment, Health or Pensions benefits immediately before entering the War Occupation, and that the employment is such that the employee would be compulsorily insurable, if he were in Great Britain. The condition that the employer must have a place of business in Great Britain does not apply in the case of U.N.R.R.A.I ■ • m,' (c) you have been working all the time you have be^n abroad up to 5th July, 1948, for an employer who has a place of business in the United Kingdom (not necessarily the same employer all the time), and (d) you are at 5th July, 1948, working for an employer with a place of business in Great Britain, and (e) you are ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom—you are insured and your employer must pay Class 1 contributions and can deduct your share from your pay. From 4th July, 1949, or any earlier date when you cease working for an employer with a place of business in Great Britain, this arrangement will end, and if you are still abroad (but ordinarily resident in Great Britain) you will have to decide whether to continue contributing by paying Class 3 contributions. Such contributions, if paid regularly, will count for all benefits when you return to Great Britain, just as if they were Class 1 contributions paid in Great Britain. 10. If you went abroad before 1st January, 1946, but otherwise fulfil the conditions (a) to (e) in para. 9, your employer will not be paying contributions for you, and you must decide whether to pay Class 3 contributions from 5th July, 1948. Such contributions will count for benefits as described in para. 2. Were You a Voluntary Contributor ? 11. If you were immediately before 5th July, 1948, contributing to National Health or Contributory Pensions Insurance, but are not covered by paras. 8, 9 or 10, you become insured under the new scheme on 5th July, 1948, and may pay Class 3 (or, if you wish, and if you are gainfully occupied. Class 2) contributions, provided that either you have lived in the United Kingdom continuously for a period of at least three years at some time or you have paid at least 104 contributions under the old National Health or Contributory Pensions Scheme. Any Class 3 or Class 2 contributions you pay will not be treated as Class 1 for benefit purposes, but will count for benefit as described in para. 2. Group li War Occupations 12. If you are in a War Occupation (similar to those described in para. 8) but have not been compulsorily insured (perhaps because your pay was more than £420 a year), you are probably in a Group II War Occupation*. If, when you left Great Britain, you were told that your previous insurance could be kept alive subject to payment of back contributions at the end of * A Group II War Occupation includes employment other than a Group I War Occupation (para. 8) abroad (but not in Eire) in a civilian capacity by the Admiralty, Army Council, Air Council or other Government Department, or by N.A.A.F.I. or by a Works Contractor to the Admiralty, Army Council or Air Councii or by a voluntary organisation engaged in hospital, ambulance, relief, rehabilitation or canteen work, and employment abroad (but not in Eire) as a soldier serving in an overseas contingent or in the naval, military, air or other service of a foreign power allied with the United Kingdom. To qualify for treatment at in a Group II War Occupation, the employed person must have fulfilled certain conditions in respect of his insurance before entering the War Occupation. 910 your war occupation, you are in a Group II War Occupation. If you are in doubt about your status, write to the Ministry of National Insurance, Contributions, Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, giving details of your present employment, when you went abroad, your employment immediately before you went abroad and your insurance record (the name of the Approved Society you belonged to, and the number on your insurance card). If you establish that you are in a Group II War Occupation, you will have the option of paying contributions for the period of your employment in a Group II War Occupation up to 4th July, 1948. This payment may be useful so as to link up your old and your new insurances and give you early title to benefit; also, if you are not brought into insurance under paras. 8-11, it brings you in with the right to pay contributions as described in para. 11. But you must exercise this option by 4th July, 1949, or within six months of your War Occupation ending—whichever is earlier. Mtetuvning to Great Uritain 13. If none of the last five paragraphs covers your case, you cannot become insured while you are abroad. But if you return to Great Britain before 5th July, 1951, you will have the chance then to pay Class 3 contributions for the period from 5th July, 1948, to the date of your return, so as to start off with a full contribution record.* But you must decide whether to pay and record your decision at a local National Insurance Office within six months of your return. You will, in any case, on returning to Great Britain, become insured and liable for contributions six months after your arrival, or earlier if you take up work for an employer. Married Women and Widows Receiving Benefit 14. As explained in para. 4, most married women are sufficiently covered by their husbands’ insurance. Those who are working solely on their own home duties and not already in insurance, cannot come into insurance even when in Great Britain. Other married women may choose whether to contribute or not. Those abroad who may contribute (paras. 8 to 12), will need to consider their personal position before deciding; for instance, if a woman will reach pensionable age (60) many years before her husband will reach 65 and qualify (if retired) for a pension and an increase (or separate pension) in respect of her, she may decide to pay contributions so as to earn a pension on her own insurance at the age of 60. Those married women who are in the groups compulsorily insured by reason of their employment (paras. 8 and 9), may decide not to pay con tributions. If you take advantage of this right, your decision cannot come into effect until you have notified the Ministry of National Insurance and the Ministry has told your employer that he need no longer pay your share of the Class 1 contribution. ♦ The yearly average of contributions which you are required to maintain for full Widow’s and Retirement Pensions cover is calculated in these cases from a date in 1948.( 3 &gt; Widows have a similar right to be excused from contributing, while they are receiving benefit (other than a pension, normally 10s., under the old Contributory Pensions scheme). Details of the position of married women are given in Leaflet N.I. 1, and of Widow’s Benefit in Leaflet N.I. 13 (see Appendix). You may wish to obtain one of these leaflets before coming to a decision. itecortliny your Decision 15. You must notify the Ministry of National Insurance, Contributions, Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, if— (a) you wish to pay Class 3 or Class 2 contributions while abroad. You must post your notification within six months of the date from which your choice is to operate; (b) being in a Group II War Occupation you want to pay contributions for the period up to 4th July, 1948 (para. 12). You must post your notification within 6 months of the end of the War Occupation and in any case before 4th July, 1949; (c) being a married v/oman or a widow in receipt of Widow’s Benefit (other than a pension under the old Contributory Pensions Scheme), you do not wish to pay your Class 1 contributions. This choice can only come into effect after you have notified the Ministry, and they have told your employer (para. 14); (d) on teaching pensionable age before completing the 10 (or five) years of insurance necessary to qualify for pension, you want a refund of contributions (para. 4). In the case of (a) or (b), the easiest way is to fill in the form at the end of this leaflet. Send your contribution card (if you have one) with the form. In the case of (c) or (d) write to the Ministry of National Insurance, Contributions, Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, giving your full name and address, and quoting your National Insurance number, if you know it, or if you do not, the number on your old Health or Pensions card and the name of the Approved Society to which you belonged. Claiming Dene fit 16. If you become entitled to benefit, or increase of benefit, while abroad, write to Ministry of National Insurance, Contributions, Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, asking for the appropriate application form. As there are time limits for the acceptance of claims, you should apply as soon as possible. In the case of maternity benefit, the request for an application form should be sent three months in advance of the confinement. If that is not possible, you should send a claim accompanied by a certificate of confinement signed by a doctor or midwife; the claim should in this case be posted within three months after the confinement. Paying Contributions while Abroad 17. There are two alternative ways of paying Class 3 or Class 2 contributions, while you are abroad. 11You can arrange with the Ministry of National Insurance for someone in Great Britain to stamp your card for you. He should exchange it for a new card when it expires. Alternatively, you can pay at half-yearly intervals by British Postal Order, or Money Order (where British Postal Orders are not obtainable), or by cheque on a bank in Great Britain or by Banker’s Draft. Such payments should be made payable to “The National Insurance Fund’’, and crossed “Bank of England’’ and sent to “Ministry of National Insurance, Newcastle-on-Tyne, England’’. When making a payment in currency other than that of Great Britain, care should be taken to ensure that the amount remitted is sufficient at the current rate of exchange to cover the sum required to be paid, including clearance charges (if any). All remittances should be accompanied by a letter giving your name and address and your insurance number, and stating what period the payment covers. , You may, if you wish, arrange with a bank in Great Britain to make half-yearly payments. Employers 9 Contri hot ions 18. Employers should stamp the cards of those employees abroad (i.e., outside Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man) who are compulsorily insurable, just as in the case of employees at home, except that, as Industrial Injury contributions are not payable, lower value stamps are required (see para. 2). These stamps are available at Post Offices. The classes of employees abroad who are insurable as employed persons (Class 1) are:— (a) (b) Persons in Group I War Occupations who went abroad after 4th July, 1947, and have been contributing. Persons who went abroad after 4th July, 1947, and have contributed under the Unemployment Insurance (Employment outside the U.K.) Regulations, 1936, and remain in the same employment. Till they have been abroad one year, ► or the employment ceases, whichever is sooner. (These two classes are those whose employers have paid compulsory contributions in the past —see para. 8.) (c) Persons ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom who went to a job abroad between 1st January, 1946, and 4th July, 1948—other than those at (a) and (b) above (see para. 9). Till 3rd July, 1949, or the employment ceases, whichever is sooner. (d) Persons ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, who went abroad to a job after 4th July, 1948. (This class is not dealt with elsewhere in this leaflet.) Till they have been abroad one year, or the employment ceases, whichever is sooner. Married women abroad have the same choice not to pay as married women at home; but in their case the employer will receive the label to fix to the card direct from the Ministry. Contributions of 3s. (women over 18) and Is. 9d. (women under 18) are required in these cases; 3s. stamps are available at Post Offices; there are no Is. 9d. stamps, but a 3s. 6d. stamp may be affixed every other week. 1213 Cards should be exchanged at the end of their currency in the ordinary way, but the employer should fill in the insured person’s address and write “abroad” in the space for signature. When contributions cease to be payable while the insured person is still abroad, the card should be sent to the Ministry of National Insurance, Contributions, Newcastle-on-Tyne, with a statement of the reason for the discontinuation of Class 1 contributions (i.e., because the employment has ceased or because the period of liability has ended). The Ministry will then advise the insured person of the options open to him. If an employer does not hold a contribution card for an employee in respect of whom contributions are payable, he should obtain an Emergency Card from a local National Insurance Office for stamping until the ordinary contribution card is obtained. Any employer with employees overseas who have not been registered, should apply to the Ministry of National Insurance, Contributions, Newcastle-on-Tyne, for a supply of forms C.F. 81.Appendix There are a number of other leaflets in this series dealing with particular aspects of the National Insurance and Industrial Injuries Schemes. They are, of course, written primarily for people in Great Britain; some of them would be of no interest to people abroad, but those listed below may be useful for some people overseas who are in particular jobs or professions or are interested in particular benefits. 'You can get any of them from the Ministry of National Insurance, Contributions, Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, or you can ask a friend in Great Britain to get a copy for you from any Local National Insurance Office. But if you do get any of them, remember that they do not deal in any detail with the special case of people abroad, and will be of use mainly to show what your position may be after your return to Great Britain.

AO k Members of the Foreign Service and all staff employed by the Foreign Office at Posts overseas will be anxious to know how th#, National Insurance Act of 1946, which came into force on 5th July, 1948, affects them. A memorandum is attached which has been prepared to help the Foreign Service and its complemen tary staffs overseas to understand the regulations, which are very complicated. A leaflet produced by the Ministry of National Insurance for people who are abroad on 5th July, 1948, is also attached. 2. Very briefly the position is that some members of the Foreign Service, and some of the other staff recruited in the United Kingdom will be obliged to pay insurance contributions at the rate of 4s. Id. a week for men and 3s. Id. for women for twelve months from 5th July, 1948, with the option of making voluntary contributions afterwards if they wish. Some may have to pay for less than one year. Others may enter on a voluntary basis straight away. This depends on the date on which they left the United Kingdom. There are others who will be unable to join at all until they come back to this country. The enclosures explain how the plan wall work as regards people who are overseas ana discuss the advantages of joining for those who have the choice. 3. An opportunity to study the memorandum should be given to everyone who was recruited in the United Kingdom, since at some time or other they will each have to decide whether or not to make voluntary payments. Apart from this no action need be taken on receipt of this letter until the forms which are mentioned His Majesty’s Superintending Consular Officers. 14890 35554—51 =in the memorandum arrive from this country. Members of the staff who were engaged locally and who are interested in insurance should read the leaflet 38a prepared by the Ministry of National Insurance. 4. The right to participate in the National Health Scheme is not dependent on insurance under the National Insurance Act. Millions who are not insured will in fact benefit from the National Health Service. 5. A similar circular is being addressed to His Majesty’s Representatives (as No. 0114). I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ERNEST BEVIN.3 Enclosure NATIONAL INSURANCE The scheme for insurance provided in the National Insurance Act of 1946 came into operation on 5th July, 1948. Though starting on the same date, National Insurance is quite distinct from the National Health Service described in Circular 080 of 18th June, 1948, and should not be confused with it. Briefly, the benefits of the National Insurance scheme are distributed in cash; those of the National Health Service in kind. 2. As part of the National Insurance scheme, plans have been made to bring in people, who although abroad on 5th July, 1948, have lived in the United Kingdom. This means that some members of the Foreign Service serving overseas and Civil Servants, including temporary staff who were recruited in the United Kingdom, will now be obliged to pay contributions for a period which may be one year or less. They will then have to decide whether or not to contribute voluntarily while they remain overseas. For others there will be no compulsory period and they will have six months from 5th July, 1948, in which to make up their minds whether to participate voluntarily or not. The distinction depends largely on the date on which their last period of duty in the United Kingdom ended. Everyone will in any event have to contribute on return to this country at once if in employment, or otherwise after six months. The object of making voluntary contributions is to qualify to draw the benefits when living in the United Kingdom. Paragraphs 3 to 6 of this memorandum are meant to convey generally to those overseas an outline of the National Insurance scheme as it applies to those who are residing in the United Kingdom. Paragraph 6 shows modifications in the scheme applicable to members of the Foreign Service and Civil Servants who are in the United Kingdom. Paragraphs 7 to 16 concern members of the staffs of our Posts abroad on 5th July, 1948, when the new scheme starts. Paragraph 14 is for the benefit of all staff who were locally engaged, whether of British nationality or not. I.—The Working of the National Insurance Scheme in the United Kingdom The Benefits — 3. For those who are insured and are in the United Kingdom, these are the normal rates of benefit:— Sickness Benefit: 26s. a week plus 16s. for wife and 7s. §d. for first child. (This is a cash benefit and corresponds to sick pay. It has nothing to do with medical attendance and treatment which are dealt with under the National Health Act.) 35554—5ia B 24 Unemployment Benefit: 26s. a week plus 16s. a week for wife and 7s. Qd. for first child. Maternity Benefit:— (1) a Maternity Grant of £A on the birth of a child; (2) a Maternity Allowance of 36s. a week for 13 weeks payable to women who normally have a job. It does not apply to women who are running their own homes or who are in employment in partnership with their husbands. (3) an Attendance Allowance of 20s. a week for 4 weeks payable to women who are not entitled to the Maternity Allowance. Widow’s Benefit:— (1) a Widow’s Allowance of 36s. a week for 13 weeks from the husband’s death plus 7s. 6^. for the first child under school leaving age; (2) a Widowed Mother’s Allowance of 33s. 6d. a week for 13 weeks if there is a child under school leaving age. This is payable when the Widow’s Allowance ends. (3) a Widow’s Pension; the normal rate is 26s. a week and it is payable for life or until remarriage— (a) when the Widow’s Allowance ends, if the widow is over 50 and had been married 10 years; or (b) when the Widowed Mother’s Allowance ends, if the widow is over 40 and 10 years have elapsed since since her marriage; or (c) if she is incapable of supporting herself when the Widow’s Benefit would otherwise cease. Retirement Pension: 26s. a week plus 16s. a week for wife and 7s. 6d. for first child to men who retire at 65 and women who retire at 60. Death Grant: Up to £20 towards the cost of funeral expenses on the death of an insured person or of the wife, widow, husband or child of an insured person. Guardian’s Allowance: 12s. a week for a child whose parents are dead. Industrial Injury Benefits:— (1) Injury Benefit of 45s. a week for 26 weeks; (2) Disablement Benefit varying from 45s. a week for 100 per cent, disablement to 9s. a week for 20 per cent. (3) Death Benefit of 30s. a week to widow if over 50, or permanently unable to support herself, or with care of child. In other cases 20s. a week.'ll •4 i f There are three classes of insured people in the United Kingdom who will receive benefits as follows:— Class 1 will receive all National Insurance benefits and applies only to “ employed ” persons, i.e., those paid to work by an employer. Class 2 will receive all National Insurance benefits except Unemployment and Industrial Injury Benefits. In the United Kingdom it applies chiefly to self-employed people, i.e., professional men, shopkeepers on their own account, &amp;c. Class 3 gives cover for all except Sickness, Unemployment and Industrial Injury Benefits and Maternity Allowance. In the United Kingdom it covers non-employed people, that is, people not in Classes 1 or 2. The right to draw benefits is dependent on the payment of a certain number of weekly contributions, which is constant in all classes. The Contributions — 4. The main rates payable each week in the United Kingdom are:- Class 1 Men Women Age Paid by Paid by Employee Employer d. s. d. s. Paid by Paid by Total Employee Employer Total d. s. d. s. d. s. d. 18 and over 4 11 Under 18... 2 10£ 4 2 2 5£ 9 1 5 4 3 10 2 4 3 3 1 11 7 1 4 3 Men Class 2 s. d. Women 18 and over Under 18 18 and over Under 18 6 2 3 7 18 and over Under 18 Men Class 3 s. d. Women 4 8 2 9 18 and over Under 18 Contribution Conditions to qualify for Benefits in the United Kingdom 5. Entitlement to most benefits depends on two conditions:— (a) before any benefit can be drawn a certain number of con tributions must have been paid;6 (b) before full rate of benefit can be drawn a certain number of contributions must have been paid over a given period. “Credits” to bridge contribution gaps are allowable in certain circumstances. Rights earned by having contributed to the old National Health, Contributory Pensions and Unemployment Insurance Schemes count towards qualification for benefit for those insured in the new service. For example, 104 contributions to the former National Health scheme (the number which was required to qualify for benefit) will count as 156 towards entitlement to the new Sickness Benefit, this being the requisite number to qualify under the National Insurance Act. Generally the benefits of National Insurance are only payable during residence in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, though Widows’ and Retirement Benefits can be drawn in the British Commonwealth and Empire. The only exception of any interest is the Maternity Grant and Attendanve Allowance which can be drawn wherever the confinement takes place if the mother is ordinarily resident in Great Britain. In this case payment can be made to the mother on her return to Great Britain or in her absence to some person whom she nominates. For the Guardian’s Allowance and the Industrial Injury Benefits there are no special contribution conditions. The con ditions to be satisfied to qualify for the Sickness, Unemployment and Maternity Benefits are numerous and anyone desiring precise information should write to the Ministry of National Insurance (Contributions), at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and ask for a copy of their Family Guide to the National Insurance Scheme. This booklet also includes information as to the length of time, which varies according to the number of contributions paid, during which Sickness and Unemployment Benefits can be drawn. The conditions governing the award to an insured person of a Retirement Pension or Widow’s Benefit, which includes Pension, will be of special interest. In both cases 156 weekly contributions must have been paid (104 if insurance for pension under former arrangements began before 30th September, 1946), and to obtain the full rate of benefit a yearly average of 50 contributions must have been paid or credited. (This is explained on page 6 of Leaflet 38a.) Those who subscribed to Old Age Pensions Insurance under the former scheme before 30th September, 1946, must wait five years from the date they began paying before becoming qualified for retirement pension. Those who entered after that date and those who first become insured when the new scheme begins on 5th July, 1948, must wait ten years from 5th July, 1948, for Retirement Pension. If at the age of 65 (60 for women) the qualifying period has not been completed contributions can be paid to bridge the gap, or a refund with interest can be claimed on that part of the contributions which was paid for RetirementVHHNES9H 1*2) i | 7 Pension. With regard to the Widow’s Benefit, a man need only have contributed for three years before he dies for his wife to get it. Some Reservations in the application of certain Benefits to members of the Foreign Service and Civil Servants 6. (a) Sickness and Injury Benefits and Maternity Allowances. Since members of the Foreign Service and Civil Servants already draw full pay during certain periods of sick leave, they cannot in addition draw either of these three benefits at the same time. When they are on sick leave at a reduced rate of pay, they may, however, draw sickness or injury benefit or maternity allowance in addition, provided that what they receive altogether does not amount to more than their normal full pay. {b) Retirement Pension. Members of the Foreign Service and Civil Servants who were established before 1st March, 1948, will be able to draw the Retirement Pension under the National Insurance Act, if they qualify by payment of contributions, in addition to their full Civil Service pensions. This will also apply to anyone who was serving in an unestablished capacity on that date and subsequently becomes established without a break in service. In the case of members of the Foreign Service or Civil Service who are recruited after 1st March, 1948, and in all other cases not covered in the preceding paragraph, on reaching the age of 65 (or 60 in the case of a woman) the pension payable under the Superannuation Acts of 1834 and 1936 will be reduced. The reduction will be £1 14s. tid. a year for each year of service which is taken into account in computing the pension, subject to a maximum of £&lt;61 15s. Od. a year. II.—The Application of the National Insurance Scheme to Staff serving at Foreign Service Posts overseas on 5th July, 1948 Eligibility 7. The scheme is in principle applicable to any employee of His Majesty's Government, irrespective of nationality or establishment, who is in our employ on or after 5th July, 1948. The factors which determine whether and how the scheme is applicable to any given individual are the following:— (i) previous residence in Great Britain; (ii) length of time abroad; (hi) previous insurance under former National Health, Con tributory Pensions and Unemployment Insurance Schemes; (iv) whether the present employment at the Foreign Service Post overseas was immediately preceded by work for an employer with a place of business in Great Britain (which includes the Foreign Office). *8 As a result of consideration of these factors it is possible to determine whether a given individual must, may or may not participate in the scheme. Compulsory Participants. 8. Members of the staff who musti pay contributions for a period are:— (a) All those who under previous legislation have been com pulsorily insured for Health or Pensions or Unemployment or Widows’ and Orphans’ Benefits. These people must contribute until they have completed one year’s insurance while serving abroad starting from 5th July, i947, unless they have already completed it. (b) All other members of the staff who went abroad after Is/ January, 1946, and were working for the Foreign Office or other employer in the United Kingdom immediately before they went, and have been at some Foreign Service Post (not necessarily the same one) or working for an employer with a place of business in the United Kingdom from that date up to 5th July, 1948. (The employment must have been continuous but not necessarily with the same employer provided he has a place of business in the United Kingdom.) In addition the individual must be ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, and on this the Ministry of National Insurance is likely to accept the view of the applicant, provided the preceding conditions are satisfied. People in this category must pay insurance contributions for one year from 5th July, 1948. (c) People who are sent abroad by the Foreign Office at any time after the 5th July, 1948, provided that they were employed immediately before leaving the United Kingdom and are ordinarily resident there. They will have to pay contributions for one year from the date they go abroad. Voluntary Participants 9. Members of the staff who may subscribe while they are overseas are:— [a) All those who went abroad before Is/ January, 1946, but who otherwise satisfy the conditions laid down in paragraph 8 (b) above. For this purpose, periods of leave taken in the United Kingdom will be ignored and the position of members of the Foreign Service and others with long periods of service overseas will be decided by reference to their last period of duty in the United Kingdom; [b) Anyone who completes a period of compulsory insurance under the new scheme in accordance with paragraph 8 above; [c) Anyone who was compulsorily insured abroad throughout the year from 5th July, 1947, to 5th July, 1948, for Health or Pensions or Unemployment or Widows’ and Orphans’ Benefits;(d) All who were voluntary contributors immediately before 5th July, 1948 (and are not now compulsorily insurable on other grounds) provided that they have lived in the United Kingdom continuously for three years or have paid 104 contributions under the former Contributory Pensions Scheme. Those who are precluded from joining the National Insurance Scheme 10. Any member of the staff serving overseas whose case is not covered in paragraph 8 or paragraph 9 above cannot parti cipate in the scheme until he comes to live in the United Kingdom. Contributions Payable while Overseas 11. {a) by the Compulsory Contributors :— The following are the rates to be paid each week by the compulsory contributors referred to in paragraph 8:— Employed Persons Paid by Paid by Employee Employer s. d. s. d. Men aged 18 and over... 4 7 3 10 Men under 18 ... ... 2 8 2 3 Women aged 18 and over 3 7 3 0 Women under 18 ... 2 2 19 Total s. d. 8 5 4 11 6 7 3 11 They are called Class 1 Contributions and are less than the equiva lent rates paid in the United Kingdom because they exclude the Industrial Injuries contribution which is not payable during absence overseas. (b) by the Voluntary Participants :— There are two rates of voluntary contribution for those overseas: Class 2 and Class 3. The amounts payable are the same as those shown in paragraph 4 for these classes. Those who elect to join after a compulsory period of overseas insurance (as in paragraph 9 (6) or 9 (c) above) may only pay Class 3 contributions. These payments will be treated on return to the United Kingdom as though they had been contributions in Class 1, which entitles the holder to all benefits. The other voluntary contributors under the new scheme (those mentioned in paragraphs 9 [a) and 9 (d) above) can pay contributions in Class 2 or Class 3, which will be counted as such in connexion with the benefits which can be drawn when in the United Kingdom. Class 2 provides for sickness benefit and maternity allowance (which are excluded in Class 3) but is of little interest to members of the Foreign Service or to temporary staff while they are Civil Servants.10 Members of the staff who qualify to become voluntary con tributors under paragraphs 9 (a) or 9 (c) or 9 (d) above have six months from the date of the new scheme (5th July, 1948), in which to exercise their option. Those who qualify under paragraph 9 {b) will get six months from the date on which they cease to be com pulsory contributors in which to decide whether to continue their payments voluntarily. There is a further concession whereby people who return to the United Kingdom before 5th July, 1951, and have not been previously insured under the present scheme will be allowed to pay Class 3 contributions retroactively back to 5th July, 1948, in order to qualify earlier for benefits in the United Kingdom. All contributions paid are exempt from income tax. HI.—Action: How people who are overseas will become insured Action at Posts overseas 12. Lists will shortly be sent to all Foreign Service Posts of staff who were sent out by the Foreign Office from the United Kingdom and are consequently likely to be either compulsory or voluntary contributors. A supply of forms (CF81) will also be sent, which should be completed at once by the people whose names are on the lists, and returned to the Foreign Office. These forms will be sent on to the Ministry of National Insurance, and in the light of the evidence they contain that Ministry will decide whether each individual must, may or cannot pay contributions. For those who have to contribute, arrangements will be made between the Ministry of National Insurance and the Foreign Office and the necessary deductions will continue to be made from their salaries. Those who may make voluntary payments will eventually receive their instructions directly from the Ministry of National Insurance and will be asked to make their own arrangements for paying directly with that Ministry. Similar information will be sent later by that Ministry to those who having been compulsorily insured for a time may at the end of that period continue voluntarily. Collection of Compulsory Contributions 13. From 5th July, 1948, and pending the outcome of an individual survey, the Foreign Office will pay employer’s con tributions and will deduct each employee’s contribution at the rates given in paragraph 11 {a) above, from the salaries of all staff who are United Kingdom-based. These contributions will be refunded to all who subsequently are found not to be compulsorily insurable.IS to become voluntary con- :) or 9 [d) above have six ; (5th July, 1948), in which alify under paragraph 9 (b) aich they cease to be com- whether to continue their rther concession whereby dom before 5th July, 1951, under the present scheme buttons retroactively back earlier for benefits in the from income tax. ho are overseas ured all Foreign Service Posts ign Office from the United to be either compulsory of forms (CF81) will also once by the people whose the Foreign Office.

These contributions will found not to be compulsorily 11 Staff who were Locally Engaged 14. Locally recruited staff, be they of British nationality or not, who are interested in the National Insurance Scheme, should be given an opportunity to read the National Insurance Leaflet 38a of which a copy is attached. Their attention should be drawn in particular to the conditions which have to be satisfied to secure entry to the scheme. People who have never been resident in Great Britain cannot be insured while they remain outside Great Britain. If they have resided in Great Britain for less than three years on end and they were not insured under the old Insurance Schemes, they cannot be insured unless prior to their present employment at a Foreign Service Post they were working for another employer in Great Britain immediately before going abroad. After study of the leaflet, anyone hitherto left out who thinks that he (or she) may qualify for enrolment should apply directly to the “ Ministry of National Insurance (Contributions), Newcastle-on-Tyne, England.” They will then receive a personal copy of Leaflet 38a and should complete the form (C.F. 82) printed on the last page of this leaflet. Before making any such application they should, however, bear in mind that while the payment of contributions during service overseas will count ' towards fulfilment of the contribution conditions for benefits on return to the United Kingdom, no benefits are payable in foreign territory with the exception of the Maternity Grant and Attendance Allowance, which can only be drawn if the mother is ordinarily resident in Great Britain (see paragraph 5 above). Married Women 15. Any married women who may be employed by the Foreign Office overseas are in the same position as'other members of the staff as regards Class 1 contributions, except that being covered by the husband’s insurance they may be excused, if they wish, from paying their own contributions. A married woman who is not in employment is not automatically eligible to become a Class 3 contributor if her husband is alive and they are not divorced. She is eligible for benefits according to the nature of her husband’s insurance. For this she does not pay separate contributions. Married women when considering whether to exercise their right to be excused payment of Class 1 contributions or whether to pay voluntary Class 3 contributions should bear in mind that while contribution rates are lower for women than for men (see paragraph 4), (1) Widow’s Benefit is dependent on the husband’s insurance; the widow’s own insurance cannot give title to widow’s benefit. (2) Maternity Benefit can be paid on either the father’s insurance or the mother’s, but not on both.12 (3) A man’s Retirement Pension can be increased by 16s. a week in respect of his wife, even if she has never paid contributions. (4) Unemployment and Sickness Benefit are paid at lower rates than those shown in paragraph 3, to married women who are living with or obtaining support from their husband. (5) Duplication of benefit (e.g., payment to a man of an increase of pension on account of his wife, and payment to her of a pension on her own insurance) is not permitted. The Advantages of Joining while Overseas 16. Notwithstanding the loss of benefits during service overseas, there are some advantages in maintaining voluntary contributions to those who want to reap the benefits of National Insurance when they are in the United Kingdom. These advantages concern people who regard themselves as normally resident in Great Britain and expect to spend their retirement there, and whose widows would live there in the event of their death. The particular advantages of entering the scheme from its start are:— (a) to complete the qualifying 156 weekly contributions to provide cover for the widow’s benefit; (b) to ensure the full rate of widow’s benefit and retirement pension, entitlement to which depends on payment of an average of 50 contributions a year. Even if the payment of contributions is delayed, this average will be cal culated from 1948 (or earlier if previously insured for pensions) and not from the date of entry; (c) to earn entitlement to the other benefits on return to the United Kingdom. People who come back to this country to work have to pay Class 1 contributions for the period of their employment, however short that may be; but they wall not be able to draw the benefits unless they have paid the requisite number of contributions. 17. Individuals who have questions to raise about their personal position should write directly to ' The Ministry of National Insurance (Contributions), Newcastle-on-Tyne, England.” Before taking this action, members of the Foreign Service and other United Kingdom-based staff would be well advised to wait until they have received and completed the forms C.F. 81 mentioned in paragraph 12 above, and sufficient time has elapsed for the Ministry of National Insurance to have studied them.

Branch B Language Examinations Dear Chancery/Consulate (-General), Foreign Office Circular No. 092 (50 to Consular posts) of 9th July, 1948, outlined the procedure for examinations for the language allowances available to members of Branch B of the Foreign Service. It has now been arranged with the Civil Service Commissioners that, starting in February 1949, such examinations in European languages (other than the Slavonic and East European languages) will be held in February and September, instead of March and October as hitherto. This is to fit in with the Services Preliminary examinations which are in some cases based on the same papers. The dates fixed for future examinations are the second Tuesday in February and the third Tuesday in September. Applications to sit for the examinations, giving full name, date of birth, and language offered, should reach Personnel Department by 19th November (for the February examination) and 1st July (for the September examination) of each year. This is a standing arrangement, and no separate notice will be sent out from here before examinations. ^The dates for holding examinations in Slavonic and East I opean, and in non-European, languages are not fixed in the same way. Examinations in these languages will be held as necessary, and applications can be sent to Personnel Department as they come forward.

The scheme is also likely to apply to those who have been contributing to the old Health and Pensions His Majesty’s Superintending Consular Officers I 504 8 35921—36'jHHlg ■ s . Hm Insurance Scheme. People who left Great Britain after 1st January, 1946, and had, up to 5th July, 1948, been working for an employer in Britain, will in most cases be liable to pay compulsory con tributions for twelve months. Others of these two groups who became insurable on 5th July, 1948, can say if they wish to pay contributions while abroad or not. The rates of contribution are 4s. Id. or 4s. 8J. for a man and Is. (V/. less for a woman. Men over 65 and women over 60 who are abroad cannot come into the scheme as new entrants. Some types of benefit—sickness or unemployment for instance —will be paid only in Great Britain, though contributions paid while abroad will, in some cases, count towards entitlement. But all contributions count towards Widow’s Benefit and Retirement Pension and both of these can be drawn anywhere in the British Commonwealth and Empire. To get the full rate of Widow’s Benefit or Retirement Pension it is usually necessary to pay contributions from the beginning of the scheme. All those abroad who expect to return to Britain, even after some years, and those who have permanently removed to the Dominions or Colonies may desire to come into the scheme from the start if they are entitled to do so. The Ministry of National Insurance cannot contact direct everyone overseas but copies of a special leaflet N.I. 38a, explaining the position to persons abroad have been sent to His Majesty’s Consulates.

Copies, too, should be kept on the counter of your public office. Yours sincerely, J.Hudson Esc., Bahrain.No.F-4-16/78 BAHRAIN, The 10th January, 1949.
