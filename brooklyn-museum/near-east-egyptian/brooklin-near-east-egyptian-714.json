Possible that she once held figure of Horus upon her lap. Isis\u2019 throne is missing though an inscribed base below her feet is preserved. She wears a full length garment which is only apparent from hem above ankles. She wears long unusual wig which flares and envelopes her shoulders without sectioning between front and back and it reaches the upper portion of her full rounded breasts. Light sketchy vertical incised lines run around wig. Upon wig is simply incised vulture headdress and projecting uraeus surmounted by sun disk and Hathor horns (slightly askew). From below the wig in the rear hangs a braided tail of hair which is curled at its tip and reaches mid-way down her back. Her right elbow is bent at sharp angle; her hand with extended fingers touches just below her left breast. Her left arm is also bent at elbow and extends forward slightly crossing body. Her hand could have reached back of neck missing Horus figure- yet child would have been very small and near her body. Isis\u2019 hand is slightly cupped upward. Facial features are carefully worked with brows, lids, short cosmetic lines and pupils inlaid with gold. Cornea of electrum or silver. Left eye set higher than right and right eye distinctly slanting. Long straight nose and small but full-lipped mouth. Very long, well articulated ears. Possible traces of gold at collar. High waisted figure with rounded belly, large depression for navel and wide hips. Possible markings of second figure near crotch of lap \u2013 otherwise surface generally smoothly preserved. Negative space between right upper arm and torso, between left upper arm and torso and between garment, feet and base. \r\nCondition: Solid cast except for square base below feet which is hollowed out. Reddish-brown surface color with some green patina. Tip of left horn of headdress broken away. Fingers of left hand also missing.", "medium": "Bronze, silver or electrum", "dimensions": "9 7/16 x 2 1/2 x 5 in.
