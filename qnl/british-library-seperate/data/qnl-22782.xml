Stannus states that it is not clear whether the firman, which prohibits the imposition of any new duties on horses or other property belonging to British subjects, has been authorised by the Persian Government. Stannus goes on to express his regret that he is unable to provide a copy of another firman, which was referred to in Captain John MacLeod's letter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x000002#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
