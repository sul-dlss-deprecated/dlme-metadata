Limits of Turkish Jurisdiction on the Arabian Coast. Note on Letter from Foreign Office dated 11th October 1888, Home No. 90ff. . In Foreign Office Despatch of the 29th August 1888, Sir W. White was informed that Her Majesty’s Government recognized Turkish juris diction on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf as far south as Katif, and that beyond that point Her Majesty’s Government consider the Chiefs to be independent, and having contracted engage ments with them they object to any attempt on the part of the Porte to extend its authority over them. Sir W T . White has not, however, yet made any communication to the Porte to this effect, for the following reasons. The Turkish Governor of Bussorah has this year visited Katif and El Katr, with the object of taking measures for the suppression of piracy in the Persian Gulf, and has taken pledges from Shaikh Jasmin-bin-Thani, of El Bidaa, on the eastern coast of the El Bidaa peninsula, and Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab, of Darain,* for the security of the coasts and waters within their influence and jurisdiction. Coal depbts have also been established by the Turks at Ras-el-Tanuruh and at El Bidaa, in which latter place they have a garrison. Sir W. White says ment for the effectual suppression of piracy on the Arabian coast of the Gulf, and no protest against the same has, as far as His Excellency is aware, been made either by Her Majesty’s Government or by the British political agents in the Persian Gulf. It would be difficult then, in any representations to the Porte, to lay down Katif as the hard and fast limit beyond which Turkish influence should not extend. The Turks would naturally point out that they had already occupied positions to the south of Katif without (as it would appear) any objection having been made by Her Majesty’s Government. Sir W. White accordingly solicits the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the subject. 17567. 1.2380.

White continues—with the ostensible object of carrying out the wishes of Her Majesty’s Govern- —The question of the extent of Turkish jurisdiction along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf has engaged the attention of the Government of India, and of the Indian and Foreign Offices at intervals during the years 1879 to 1S84 ; and it will be seen, on reference to Mr. A. W. Moore’s Narrative, Parts I. to IV., that it remained undetermined. Previous to giving a brief recital of the views held on this subject in India and at home, it will be useful to describe shortly the existing state of territorial possession along the southern shore of the Gulf. From the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab to a point nearly opposite the island of Demaum, just south of Katif, between the 26th and 27th parallels of latitude, Turkish suzerainty is acknow ledged. This is the coast line of the Turkish province of El Hasa. South and east of Demaum extends the El Katr coast as far as latitude 24° 10', longitude 53°. The greater part of El Katr is desert land. Of the fishing villages on the coast, El Bidaa is the most considerable. The question of sovereignty over El Katr generally has never yet been decided. From longitude 53° the coast as far as the promontory of Kas-ul-Kheymah, generally known as the “ Pirate Coast,” is occupied by the so-called “ Trucial Chiefs ” of Abu Thabi TVbay, Shargah, Ejman, Amulgavine, and.llas-ul- Kheymah. At Ras-ul-Kheymah begins the territory of the Sultan of Muscat or Oman, which extends south wards to and beyond Kas-el-Had, the extreme southern point of the Gulf. The British Govern ment has treaty relations with Bahrein, the Trucial Chiefs, and Muscat. The Porte claims rights of sovereignty over the El Katr coast, but they have never been admitted by Her Majesty’s Government. There has been a Turkish guard at El Bidaa since 1872, but the presence of Turkish troops at this port has never vet been made the subject of complaint on the part of Her Majesty’s Government. The Sheikh of El Bidaa is an independent chief, and not a party to the maritime truce. In 1879 proposals were made by the Government of India for a comprehensive arrangement with the Turkish Government in reference to its ter ritorial pretensions along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, and to the police of the seas in those parts. The nature of these proposals, the view taken by the Secretary of State (Viscount Cranbrook) of the different questions involved, and of an alternative proposition made by the Foreign Office, are set forth in a letter addressed to that Office on the 17th September 1879. The Government of India recommended that from Bussorah to Ojair the authority of the Porte should be recognized as established on land, but that at sea the British Government should con tinue to exercise some concurrent protectorate, pursuing pirates, if necessary, into Turkish waters, and dealing with them wherever found, whether at Vide India Office Departmental Memo randum of the 30th June 1888, on the Turkish garrison at El Bidaa. Terms of the truce are given in Memo randum, Part I., pages 6 and 7. Memorandum, Part III., page 1, et se&lt;j. Proposals of Government of India for recognition of Turkish jurisdiction.at El Bidaa, on the El Katr peninsula ; and that the Porte should be required {a) to stipulate not to interfere, either on the coast or inland, with the Trucial Chiefs between Odeid and Ras-el-Khymah; {b) to recognize the territories of the Sheikh of Bahrein as under the protection of Great Britain, and (c) in case of piracies from within its juris diction, to enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of compensation. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ob served, with reference to these proposals, that, in the absence of inducements, the Porte was not likely to assent to the suggested limitations of its sovereignty or jurisdiction, or to independent action of another power in territory or Waters admitted to he Turkish. Lord Salisbury, therefore, suggested that it would be more practical, and more in accordance with usage, that, having settled for our selves the limits within which Turkish jurisdiction may be exercised, and beyond which it would be rejected or opposed, we should, as a general rule, look to the Turkish authorities to exercise a proper police in those limits, only sanctioning the action of British cruisers in Turkish waters under special circumstances, when the consent of the local authorities had been obtained. Lord Cranbrook to be that it involved a previous understanding with the Porte, which His Lordship agreed with Lord Salisbury in thinking scarcely possible ot attainment. Apart from the notorious difficulty of negotiation with the Turkish Govern ment upon any subject, the past correspondence in reference to Nejd and Bahrein indicated that upon this particular question that Government was likely to be found specially impracticable, and that it was hopeless to expect that the Porte could be induced to record, in even the most informal diplomatic document, its assent either to limitation of its authority in Arabia or to anything like a joint maritime protectorate with the British Go vernment along any part of the coast, and, still less, to an exclusive British protectorate over Bahrein. the course suggested by the Foreign Office, while it would probably be little less distasteful to the Porte than that proposed by the Government of India, would fail to attain the object in view. If adopted, the authority and responsibility of the Turkish Government would be recognized as complete within certain territorial limits to be fixed by ourselves, and would be wholly disallowed beyond those limits. The limit of Ottoman jurisdiction along the coast, if defined at all, could scarcely he fixed at any point north of Ojair, which is opposite the Objections to course recommended by Go vernment of India. The principal objection to the course recom mended by the Government of India appeared to Objections to Foreign Office proposal. Lord Cranbrook, on the other hand, feared thatsouthern extremity of the island of Bahrein; but it was precisely between that spot and Kateef that, since the settlement of the Beni Yas at Odeid was broken up in 1878, the operations of the piratical tribes had been carried on with almost complete impunity. Lord Cranbrook apprehended that the effect of formally recognizing any particular part of the Arab coast and the waters adjacent as Turkish, and as, in consequence, closed against British cruisers, so far as action against piratical craft is concerned, would be the formation of an asylum which would be taken advantage of by marauders in general, wdiom Xhe local Ottoman authorities would be unable to control without a considerable and per manent increase to the Turkish naval force in the Gulf, w'hich the Porte had declared itself precluded from making by considerations of expense, and which would be open to many objections on political grounds. The conclusion, therefore, to which Lord Cran brook was led w r as that negotiation or discussion with the Porte on the territorial question should be avoided ; but that, in order that the obligations contracted by the Government of India towards the Sheikh of Bahrein and the parties to the maritime truce might be efficiently fulfilled, the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorized to adopt all necessary measures for the preservation of the peace of the seas, without regard either to Turkish pretensions to sovereignty over the whole Arab coast, or to the recognition of Ottoman supremacy by in dividual Chiefs such as the Sheikh of El Bidaa, or to the presence of Turkish officials at isolated points. Lord Cranbrook w^as further of opinion that, having regard to the repeated assurances given by the Turkish Government in 1871-72, at the time of the operations in Nejd, that no interference with the littoral tribes w r as intended, and to the as often repeated declaration of the British Government that it would object to any disturbance of the status quo as regards those tribes, Her Majesty’s Government might, if it w r ere deemed expedient, legitimately decline to recognize any part of the coast south of Koweit as subject to Turkey, even if Ottoman authority w*ere established there much more firmly than is really the case. Provided, how r ever, that no obstacles w r ere inter posed to any operations which might be necessary to preserve the peace of the seas and to punish marauders, and that no interference was attempted either with Bahrein, or the Trucial Chiefs frorn Odeid to Has el-Khymah, or with Muscat, Lord Cranbrook did not consider that exception need be taken to the proceedings of the Turks at any point of the coast north of Odeid. In expressing this opinion, His Lordship did not forget that the Government of India would restrain the Porte from extending its influence beyond Ojair; but, subject to the conditions above stated,Memorandum, Part III., p. 10. Memorandum, Part III., p- 15. Lord Cranbrook did not sen any sufficient reason for objecting to the establishment of such relations between the Turkish authorities in El Hassa and the tribes of the El Katr peninsula to the north of Odeid, as migl t be agreeable to the parties concerned. In Lord Cranbrook’s opinion, it was essential to the restoration and maintenance of order in the Persian Gulf that no merely nominal extension ot Turkish authority should be permitted to hamper tlu* aciion of the officers of the British Govern ment, and His Lordship desired a return, as far as possible, to the system formerly in force, under which the Resident at Bushire, and the British Naval authorities acting under his orders, dealt directly with the Arab tribes along the entire littoral, captured piratical craft wherever th e y mio-ht be found, and exacted from the local Sheikhs redress for outrages committed by their people. . Lord Salisbury, however, thought it decidedly preferable in the first instance to endeavour to come to some arrangement with the Porte by which the inconvenience resulting from the un defined nature of Turkish authority on the El Hasa coast, and from the remissness and inefficiency of the Ottoman officials in keeping the police of their waters, might, as far as possible, be obviated. Accordingly, the drafts of two Despatches to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople were sub mitted for Lord Cranbrook’s consideration, and his o-eneral concurrence in the tenor of the drafts was intimated to the Poreign Office on the 29th December 1879. The first draft dealt solely with the question of maritime procedure within “ recognized ” Turkish limits, and was embodied in a formal Note addressed to the Porte on the 7th July 1880, and couched in the following terms “ Therapia, “ M. le Ministre, “ I have the honour to invite your Excellency’s serious attention to a subject which has been repeatedly brought to the notice of the Sublime Porte by Sir. H. Layard, viz., the injury indicted on the commerce of the Persian Gulf by the succession of piratical expeditions which have issued during the course of the last two years and upwards from a portion of the coast of Arabia over which the Porte claims to have established its « From the reports which have reached Her Majesty’s Embassy of the injuries sustained by British subjects or others under British protection from these attacks, it is evident that, unless the marauders are effectually checked and punished, the peaceful trades of those waters will be seriously disturbed. “ Certainly there has been no want of courtesy or goodwill in the replies which have been returned by the Porte to Sir H. Bayard’s representations. But unfortunately, whether from the lack of alacrity on the part of the local officials or the want of adequate means for efficient naval or military measures, the assurances of the Central Government have not received any practical fulfilment upon the spot. As yet little has been done by the Turkish authorities towards the capture or punishment of the offenders, and, so far as Her Majesty’s Government are aware, there has been no attempt on their part to obtain the recovery or restitution of the plundered property, and there is too much reason to anticipate that the offenders, emboldened by the absence 17567. Bof proper measures of prevention, will continue their depredations upon a larger scale. Indeed, a report has lately reached Her Majesty’s Embassy that the Beni Hajir tribe have agnn been plundering boats off the Guttur Coast in the Persian Gulf. It is cleai that such a state ot things should not be allowed to continue, either in the interest of the Turkish Government itself, or in that of other countries interested in the commerce of the Persian Gulf. “ It would, indeed, be incredible that the Turkish Government should allow any country really and effectively subject to its authority to be made use of in time of peace as a station for the preparation of marauding expeditions directed for purposes of indiscriminate plunder against the commerce of the surrounding waters, and Her Majesty’s Government are convinced that the Porte will readily co-operate in any plan which may seem well adapted to prevent such a contingency, and the irritating claims and questions to which it cannot fail to give rise. They would propose for this purpose that the Commander of Her Majesty’s ships charged with the duty of keeping the police of the Persian Gulf, while they could be instructed to pursue their operations outside the teiritorial waters of the Arabian mainland not th of Odeid, should also have authority to pursue and capture piratical vessels within the 3-mile limit on that part of the coast whenever this course of proceeding might seem indispen sable to the attainment of their object. It would be understood that, in case of any Turkish vessel of war being in reach, the British cruiser would not act without the operation of the Turkish commander, and leaving to him, if he desired it, the principal share in the operations, and further that, whenever practicable, the previous consent of any Turkish governor or similar official on the mainland immediately adjacent would be solicited. In either case, any prizes made within recognized Turkish limits could be dealt with according to the wishes of the Turkish authorities. I have now the honour to request that your Excellency will take this matter into your consideration, and that you will have the goodness to inform me, at an early opportunity, whether the Sublime Porte is disposed to enter into an engagement of the nature described above, the tendency of which would be rather to establish, than in any way to diminish, the Sultan’s authority in the districts concerned. (Signed) G. J. Goschen. The reasons for limiting the first draft to the question of maritime procedure is thus explained in the second draft* in the following terms :— “ In the arrangement proposed in my Despatch of this day’s date, for the repression of piracy in the Persian Gulf, no attemot is made at an explicit settlement of the question, how far Turkish authority shall be recognized to exist along the Arabian coast. Bearing in mind the exaggerated claims of traditional sovereignty which the Porte is always prone to advance, and its indisposition to abandon the smallest particle of the Sultan’s nominal juris diction, it does not seem probable that any agreement could be effected on this point, and the discussion might seriously interfere with the conclusion of any arrangement whatever. “2. The views of Her Majesty’s Government upon the matter are, however, decided. Wherever the Turkish authority is at the present time actually and firmly established upon the coast they are ready to recognize it, and would gladly see it accompanied by a regular and civilized administration. “ 3. On the other hand, they see no advantage to the Porte, and only detriment to other countries, in vague claims of juris diction which have no practical enforcement, and serve merely as a protection for lawlessness and aggression on the part of the inhabitants of the territories so claimed. The Porte must not be surprised to find such claims ignored or contested, if the necessity should arise, and if it be found that asserted territorial rights are not justified and proved by a performance of the corresponding duty of control. ‘ ‘ 4. Further, as regards Muscat, Bahrein, and the possessions of the Trucial Chiefs on the coast between Odeid and Ras-el- Khymah, Her Majesty’s Government, while they think it un necessary to seek for any formal declaration from the Porte, renouncing all claims of sovereignty over those territories, are in no way disposed to recede from their repeated denial of those / ♦ Despatch to Sir H. Layard, No. 13, dated 5th January 1880.claims-, and they consider themselves bound by their treaty engage ments with the several Chiefs to resist any attempt, whether direct or indirect, to give them practical effect.” The definitive reply of the Porte was not given till the 8th February 1881, when a short Note was addressed to the Embassy to the effect, that according to the information received from the local authorities, no such thing as piracy existed in the Persian Gulf; that, nevertheless, a vessel of war had been sent to the Nejd coast as a measure of precaution, and that under these circumstances there was no occasion for the arrangement pro posed by Her Majesty’s Government. In consequence of this refusal, the Admiralty instructions issued in May 1879 to the naval officers in the Gulf were modified. Mr. Moore, in his Memorandum of the 2nd December 1881 (Part III.), thus summarizes the practical outcome of the corre spondence of the past two years. A certain liberty of action has been given to British cruisers along the El Katr coast, subject to a proviso that captures made in Turkish juris diction are to be made over to the Turkish autho rities ; but it has been left doubtful how far along the coast 1 urkish jurisdiction is to be recognized as extending. The Porte has been, or will be, informed that British naval officers in the Persian Gulf will be authorized to take such measures as they may think fit for the protection of British commerce and shipping, including, it is presumed, that of Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs, without reference to the claims of the Sultan to territorial jurisdiction in those waters; hut no such wide license has, in fact, been given. On the whole, it is perhaps not going too far to say that as between us and the Turkish Govern ment the territorial question has been shelved, not solved, and that our attitude towards the petty Chiefs and tribes on the El Katr coast still remains to be determined. The Department is inclined to deprecate any attempt being made to induce the Porte to a«ree to a definition of the limit of Turkish jurisdiction on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf The difficulties attending such a negotiation when it was proposed by the Government of India in 1879 are pointed out at page 3 of this Memorandum, and there is no reason for supposing that the Porte would be less “ impracticable” at the present time. Besides, the recognition of any particular part of the Arab coast and the waters adjacent would, it is feared, have the effect of forming a »piratical Alsatia perhaps necessitating an increase to the Turkish naval force in the Gulf, a measure open to many objections politically. The position is admittedly a peculiar one. Her Majesty’s Go vernment decline to admit the claim of Turkey tosovereignty over the El Katr coast, and the Sultan uncompromisingly maintains his rights over that coast. The Sheikh of El Bidaa, an independent Chief, not a party to the maritime truce, has allowed the Turks to maintain a garrison there since 1872, and Her Majesty’s Government have never protested against this assertion of Turkish supremacy on this portion of the El Katr coast. The maintenance of the supremacy of our naval force in the Gulf should be upheld as guaranteeing security to British trade and commerce, and affording protection to the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs on that coast with whom we have treaty engagements. A merely nominal extension of Turkish supremacy should not be allowed to hamper British naval officers in the repression of piracy and the pursuit of piratical craft wherever they may he found.
