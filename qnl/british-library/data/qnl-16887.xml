It reports that the Resident's efforts to mediate the dispute have failed, and that it is his opinion that both sides are intent on violent revenge. It also notes that the Resident does not think that the Governor of Bushire can be depended upon to secure Rama bin Jaubir's good behaviour. The letter therefore requests instructions from the Bombay Government as to what he should do with Rama bin Jaubir's batille (a small sea going vessel), which he holds on deposit; he no longer sees any prospect that holding the vessel will affect a settlement.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x000021#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
