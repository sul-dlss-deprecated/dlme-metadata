The request is for an extension of the previously agreed period of nine years which had been allocated for the company to undertake a geological examination of the agreed area prior to drilling. The next letter in the file is a reply from the Sultan who agrees to the extension owing to the disruption caused by the Second World War. The documents following this include copies of the original oil concession agreements (both the commercial agreement between the Sultan and the petroleum company and the political agreement between the company and the British Government), and copies of related correspondence between the Political Agent in Bahrain, the Shaikh of Sharjah, the India Office and Petroleum Concessions Limited, relating to the original agreements.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Sharjah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00001d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00001d#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00001d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
