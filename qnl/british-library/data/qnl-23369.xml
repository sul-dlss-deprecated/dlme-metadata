In this connection will you please refer to Ag ncy Yours sincerely, C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, c.b.e., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain.4. Bahrain, May 25, 1942. I should like to have your advice about driving and car licences for vehicles used by military autho rities now in Bahrain and likely to come here. Do you think that the Bahrain Government ought to waive the fees or not? Various people have now applied for licences such as Major Hill, Chase and others. The former said he had no objection to paying for licences as the military authorities would pay these expenses. We do not charge the Defence Officer as his troops are State troops and are paid for by the Bahrain Govern ment, though he himself is paid by the British Government. I understand that there may be as many as thirty of forty motor vehicles, lorries, cars, motor bicycles, if and when troops come to Muharraq and even now the number of vehicles is steadily increasing. I do not know what is customary under similar circumstances elsewhere, perhaps it would be difficult to find an exact parallel, but I should like to have your views on this matter. E. B.

Motor vehicles owned by His Britannic Majesty’s Fighting Services are registered by the Commands under which they are serving and are subject to no other forms of registration anywhere in the world. Inasmuch, howevei as such vehicles are at times driven by Commissioned CffiJ when not on duty such Officers ought to be in possession of a driving licence. Such licences are not ordinarily required of professional military drivers. 3. I suggest that the simplest orocedure is to grant driving licences on payment of fees to such Officers as apply for them. If Officers stationed in Bahrain who use Service vehicles for other than official purposes do not obtain driving licences I suggest that you should let me Know and I v/ill have the matter brought to their notice.

I have myself seen cases of military vehicles driving dangerously in the town. The Police are unable to report tnc vehicles because it is difficult for them to distinguish the numbers. Some vehicles contain several numbers and letters on different parts of the body. In cases of dangerous driving which I have seen myself the drivers were local men. a. Military vehicles driven by the Sikhs have only one front lamp and this is on the left side. I think this is liable to cause accidents. Would it be possible to change the light to the right side of the cars ? 3. From now onwards the oiled roads become more slippery and more dangerous than they were*during the summer and the hours of darkness are longer. I should be very much obliged if military drivers could be wa.ned to comply with speed regulations especially after dark. 4. I do not suggest that the men driving military vehicle arc ir-or^ dangerous drivers than some of the locals but in the case of local drivers the Police are able to exercise authority over them.

I am fully aware that I did signify my agreement to charges being levied in my letter No. 581, dated the 5th March 1944 but owing to a variety of reasons I had not studied the question at that time with the care it merited. I have now had an opportunity of doing so and it is my opinion that Commissioned Officers, Non commissioned Officers and enrolled and enlisted men driving mili tary vehicles should not bo required to acquire local driving licenses unless they desire to drive non-military vehicles. 4.

Pelgravc, Esquire, Adviser, Bahrain Government, Bahrain.Regarding your D.o.Ho.1125-6/45 dated 20th April, 1944, about licenses for drivers of military vehicles, I think it would be reasonable to exempt British and U.S.A. military personnel from having to obtain driving licenses but I consider that locally enlisted drivers employed by the military authorities should obtain licenses from the Bahrain Government before being allowed to drive military vehicles.

On the 25th April, 1946, at the Court of the Indian Assistant Political Agent, he was convicted of rash driving under Section 279 of The Indian Penal Code and was fined Rs.300 or six month’s imprisonment. In this case, as a r result of his r3gligence, a man was killed. On the 16th November, 1946, he was again convicted in the same Court of a similar offence and was fined Rs.100. In this case, one man ^as slightly injured and considerable damage was done to a taxi. I am not of the opinion that it is in the interests of the public that this man should continue to hold a driving licence. I therefore request that Eis Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent exert the powers given to him under these Regulations and revoke the licence of Abdulla Yousif.

Weightman was away on recess, and I presume ‘the i ax Department were under the impression that he was Oificiating r.A., ana they therefore, presumably did not claim the tax on this account. Captain Howes, however, paid Rs.2/- for the number plate and Re.l/- for licence colder on 7th J.Awwal 1360. It is possible that this may cave led Captain Howes to believe that officer of the Political service was charged this tax. lkr t , W ^ ^ /V boa—* /b -da-ty* PrP A cn/JL^ \ j 1 - J ft H I'</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003e6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1263</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003e6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1263</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 6/45 Licensing of motor cars and driving rules - correspondence regarding'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-08-26T18:05:35</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (120 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 122; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
