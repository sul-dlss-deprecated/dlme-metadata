CONSUL'S visn* TO GWADUR, « 9■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 8/82 ss&amp; 2Q&amp;: British Consulate, 'fuscat • January 4, 1949* Sir, I have the honour to report that I have just returned from a short visit to Gwadur, for which I obtained oral approval of the Political Resident during his recent visit to Muscat. A fortunate combination of British India steamers ( one of which had been delayed by a cyclone ) enabled me to leave Jluscat on December 15th and return on December 20th having spent two days at Gwadur. Such a conjunction only occurs at rare intervals with the present inadequate service of ships. 2. Gwadur turned out to be a narrow strip of plateau, parallel with the Baluchistan coast, and connected with it in the centre by a low belt of sand about a quarter of a mile across, forming two large bays. The plateau slopes gradually on the seaward side almost to the water level, but ends to landward in an almost broken row of towering, precip itous cliffs, broken in places into fantastic shapes ; one spur is strongly reminiscent of Exeter Cathedral. The small town lies on the sandy shore near the base of the cliffs. 3. Access is normally from the eastern bay. This bay is so shallow that ships of any size have to lie several miles out. Connexion with the shore is maintained by native craft like large canoes with small keels.* It took the British Agent, ftp. Rashid Ahmed, an hour and a half to reach ray ship ( the wind being contrary ), and we were about an hour on the return journey. It has been suggested that the south-western corner of the bay could be made into an artificial harbour. No. 1 ( 1 / 8 / 82 / 49 )but I imagine the expense would be prohibitive 4. The principal British residents, with a Boy Scouts' band, were awaiting me on the beach. The process of being carted ashore like a bale of goods through a heavy surf in which one expects to be dropped at any raor.ent is not conducive to dignity ; still the meeting to the strains of the ha m3 , passed off well. As I turned away, the band struck up another tune, which I recognised, fortunately Just in tine, as a rather bedraggled version of w God save the King M . I felt e little like the embarrassed Fnglishman in ' General John Reran M who insists that he is not the Lord Lieutenant. 5. The rest of the morning was spent in receiving and re turning calls from the State authorities, and in interviewing the various Indian comnunities and bearing their grievances. Most of these I knew of already, but a little discussion certainly gave ne a better understanding of them. I had nur^- routine and other matters to discuss with *tr. Rashid, and these, together with a tea-party, took up the rest of the day. I slept at the little rest-house which belongs to Ris Majesty's Government• 6. The next morning I was awakened at an unearthly hour, and haled off before sunrise to see Gwadur's one M ancient monument ' - the so-called 'Portuguese Reservoir' on the top of the plateau. For one with a general interest in archaeology it well repaid a visit. A lorry ( itself an ancient monument and the only motor vehicle in Gwadur ) took us to the foot of the cliffs, which we climbed by a steep footpath, the only route to the plateau. A considerable part of the reservoir is still standing, and from the remarkable style of masonry I formed the opinion ( though I am no expert ) that it is of much greater antiquityantiquity than it a popular rerio fluec**ts» Unf ort.umt rly the lorr^' broke down on the way back, and I was grounded fear the rest of the tour. 7. The morning waa spent in further intervl-we and viaits to the Post Uffice and the bazaar. The latter ia a single lonf street roughly parallel with the coast, and owing to the encroachment of the sea, ia now only some thirty or forty yards from it. From the Custom louse, which is in the process of being engulfed, I was able to see the effects of this encroachment which at its t'reseni rate will leave little of Gwadur in the next few years. 1 sliall be writing separately about the effects of this on the British Agency building. 8 . I was entertained to t*« by tie Khanis, the largest Indian community in Owfidur. ' heir dcouts* band, which I have already mentioned, i«s again in attendance, and I was shown their school which has separate classes for boys and girls. 2 must say I was impressed by the attempt to maintain education and civilisation, on a v«ry nodes! seal*, in this out-of-the-way spot. 1 understand the school is paid for by the Aga Khan, a fact which helps to explain the reverence will! which his Highness is obviously regarded by his followers. 9. In the evening I was shown some native dancing by a couple of admirable female impersonators from Karachi. presence induced the Wali to come to the show $ I am told this was without precedent. ' his concluded -y visit, as the return stea:Ter arrived next morning.© 10, Apart from matters of detail, on which I may have to write separately, I forraed the impressien that it would be well for His Majesty’s Consul at Muscat t© visit Gwadur at fairly regular intervals* It is obvious that such visits are appreciated, do and they/good in more ways than one* I suggest therefore that, in view of the difficulty of knowing beforehand when a visit iS possible ( I did not know till the morning of rqy departure whether the return steamer would suit ), authority be given for an annual visit at a date to be decided by the Consul. 11* I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Political Resident at Bahrain. I have the honour to bo, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000032_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/275</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000032</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/275</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/82 II GWADUR'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-04-26T22:16:45</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 7; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file consists of a letter from the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat to the Foreign Office, which was forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.
