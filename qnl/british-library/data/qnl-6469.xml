Chapter YI.—The Aimak Tribes - Chapter VII.—Journey to Mashad, and account of theDaragez and Kalat Nadari Ataks, and of the Chapter XI.—Baku and Tiflis. Time required to move an iirmy from Baku to Kusan, near Herat - 68 Chapter XII.—On the desirability of having an English officer stationed on the Perso-Afghan I left England on the 19th August 1881, under orders received from Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, on special duty, and proceeded to Persia. I travelled by Berlin and through Middle Russia, passing Smolensk and Orel, to the terminus of the railway line at Zaritzin, on the Volga, where I embarked in a river steamer and went to Astrakan. At Astrakan, I embarked in a sea-going steamer, and went down the western coast of the Caspian to Baku, which is the chief town of the whole Caspian region, and which will rise to be a place of great importance, in consequence of the unlimited supply of petroleum which is produced in its neighbourhood. From Baku I proceeded by steamer to Enzelli, a Persian port on the southern coast of the Caspian. The steamer was unable to land the passengers, or even to approach the port of Enzelli. I next tried to land at Mashad-i-Sar, the next Persian port on the Caspian, but the steamer was also unable to approach this port in consequence of the stormy weather, and we were carried past these places. I was finally only able to land at the port of Gez, at the south-eastern corner of the Caspian. Gez is the only port on the southern coast of the Caspian into which vessels larger than steam tugs or small coasting craft can enter. Enzelli, the only other harbour, has five feet of water over the bar at the mouth. The port of Gez, though still belonging to Persia, has to all intents and purposes become a Russian port. The Russian naval station on the small island of Ashurada, at the entrance to the harbour, and the Russian guard ship which is permanently anchored in the port, render it thoroughly Russian. Gez itself is a poor little village, only important as being the port of the neighbouring town of Astrabad. Large quantities of merchandise are landed at Gez for the Khurasan market. I remained at Gez two days, waiting for a Russian steamer to take me back to arrived,'and took me to Enzelli. This time it was possible to land, and I proceeded by post to Tehran. At Tehran, after having received the necessary orders and instructions from Mr. Ronald Thomson, Her Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, I proceeded to Khaf, on the Perso-Afghan frontier. Mr. Ronald Thomson expressed a wish that I should not travel via Mashad ; I there- Chapter I.—Journey from England to Khaf, on the Berso-Afghan Frontier - Chapter II.—State of Herat, and account of Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan’s capture of that place Chapter III.—Journey from Bui Khaf to Mohsinabad, and some way up the Hari Rud River - Chapter IY.—Journey from Rui Khaf to Birjand ------ Chapter V. —Journey across the Lut Desert towards Karman - - - - .

It would have been possible to have proceeded by land from Gez to Tehran, but the journey would have taken considerably longer than returning to Enzelli and proceeding thence to Tehran. After two days the Russian steamer from Krasnovodsk fore determined to proceed by the desert road which passes through the northern•jt . .. bv Europeans. I was d ^ C ' \“ h f . ^VuLle ar^^lran that I should have a good for my journey. # I was warned by sev P P of the scarc i t y 0 f food and water. deal of difficulty in traversing tffis , , marched to Samnan, a considerable town I left Tehran on the 22nd October, and marched to ^a ^ ^ ^ S amnan, six marches on the ordinary Tehran a ^ • Kh f which j very and from near that place ruled a straight line on the^ map ^ on nearly followed during the who e journey. rp^. i • u a ra |)i a to visit the shrine of their wav from Afghanistan to Kaibala, n v x c ; »T q „„ ra frihe tnen wa.) b AlYionsrst these pilgrims were two men of the Hazaia tune, and wa., j end ' t S U i .

Many llerau piWims who were here said to me, when they heard that I was going to the Afghan border “ Why do you not go to Herat ? you would be very well received We are not “ like the Afghans of Kabul and Kandahar, and would gladly receive Englishmen. The people of Herat are chiefly of Persian race, and are very different from the population of the other parts of Afghanistan. . 1 , ii , I left Samnan on the 29th October, and marched 13 miles to a small hamlet called Gurmab. Supplies, even for my small party, were not procurable. A road goes from Samnan direct across the desert to r iabbas; this route to 1 abbas is numbered 5, and is given in my routes at the end of my Report. My next march was^ thiough a desert country, only one village (called Duzdahir, but generally marked in maps as Dusair) being passed. I halted at the end of 23 miles, at a lonely spring in the desert called Taglag. From this place I marched 19 miles to a village called Husainabad, on the edge of the cultivated portion of the Damghan district. Hence there is an almost unbroken tract of desert to the southward, while to the north, towards Damghan, there are many flourishing villages, the chief of them being Frat. On the 2nd November 1 marched from Husainabad. Soon after leaving the village the ruins of a very large city are seen, but the soil is sandy, and only very imperfect traces of the ruins remain. Here and there, however, over a very large extent of country there are traces of a great city. Coins, silver ornaments, pottery, and faience are found in very considerable quantities, showing that it has been a place of im portance. Many men are employed in hunting for curiosities amongst the mounds which mark the sites of the various buildings. Natives of the neighbourhood say the name of this city was Komesh, and add that it was one of the capitals of the Kaianian dynasty of Persian kings. I myself believe that this place is the Hecatompylos of Greek authors, and I am confirmed in this belief by General Schindler, of the Persian service. The sand is fast burying the few traces of the city that remain. A few miles after passing these ruins a piece of real salt desert, about four miles wide, is crossed. The road then rounds the end of some low hills, called Panj Kuh, after which another piece of kavir, or salt desert, some five miles in width, is crossed, and then a small spring of very brackish water is reached, called Kharghosi ; it is 22 miles from Husainabad. Here a number of nomads, with flocks of sheep and goats, were en camped, but there was no cultivation. Near this spring are some hills, with a wide pass known as Turkoman Godar, the road leading through it having been a favourite Turkoman raiding route. The next day I attempted to march to a village called Do Chah, 42^miles distant, but as the guide lost the track across the desert, ^travelled very much farther than 42 miles, f started at dawn,'and mm-ched 24 nnies over a sandy uninhabited country. About noon three small wells of good water were reached, where our horses were watered; these wells are known as Chah Jam. The mam road from Shahrud to Yazd, via Khur, here crosses the track by which I was travelling, and at this place I found a caravan of laden camels from Yazd which had come across the desert. I hurried away from these wells, as a long march Was still before me, and I was anxious to get m before dark. Though I had marched early in T ai; a snarp pace, and though I had never halted all day e^ep 1 once for a quarter of an hour at the wells, 1 had not reached Do Chah hv 10 o clock at night when! had been 1 6 hours actually marching Attlds time the fe ide declared he did not know where he was, and our party had to lie down iu thedesert without food or water for man or beast. The mules and horses were turned out in the waste, to pick up anything they could. Early the next morning I was up, and the guide at last discerned the hamlet of Do Ohah, some three miles from where we had passed the night, and I was delighted to get food and water for the men and animals. On the 5th November I made another long march of 29 miles to Gebur, leaving the small town of Biarjamand about seven miles on my left. Gebur is about nine miles beyond Biarjamand. In passing I saw the town of Biarjamand, and took the bearings ot it from the road. It is a poor little place, and Gebur is a far more flourishing village. Biarjamand, however, is a sort of capital for this part of the desert country, and the deputy of the Governor of Shahrud lives there. Gebur is a prosperous place of about 1,200 inhabitants. It consists of three villages known as Dhazian, Gebur, and Kalabalah. About a mile off is another village called Khana Khudi, which is celebrated for its good tobacco. All the country that I passed over after I left Husainabad, until I reached Biarjamand, or a distance of 85 miles, had no permanent inhabitants except a single family at Do Chah. At this season, however, every brackish little spring, of which there are several, has many flocks of sheep and goats depending on it for water. There is fairly good browzing on the desert shrubs, and the flocks which ordinarily graze in the Alburg mountains are now driven down to this edge of the desert so as to avoid the snow in the mountains, but in summer this country is quite deserted, and the heat is then, I hear, very great. Though it was the month of November, the sun had great power, and scorched the skin off my face, a thing that had rarely happened to me, even in the hot weather in India. The nights, however, were intensely cold. Biarjamand itself has about 1,200 inhabitants, and, with the group of villages depending on it, of which this place Gebur is one, is said to have about 4,000 inhabitants. At Gebur there are some ruins, but not of any great extent. They appear, however, to be very ancient. Many curiosities are found here, but they are difficult to procure, the people standing in great dread of the Government, and the regulations as to treasure-trove being very severe. I, however, procured a small ornament for hanging round a woman’s neck, with an inscription in a character unknown to me, but which is neither Cufic nor Pehlevi. The whole country that I passed over after entering the desert seemed rich in copper. I constantly passed the slag of copper furnaces, and my guide told me that he knew of at least one thousand places where copper smelting furnaces had formerly existed. Now, however, the mines were not worked, they having been declared a royal monopoly. The King himself did not work them, and allowed no one else to do so, except in two or three places. I passed what appeared to be a very rich ore of copper. Copper could be produced in almost unlimited quantities in Khurasan, but under present circumstances it does not pay very well to produce it. As smelted in Persia, it is too impure to be rolled out very thin, and can only be used for trays and such articles as can be made moderately thick. Large quantities of sheet copper are imported into Persia from England, and some from Russia, for the purpose of making cooking pots, as these can not be made from the native copper. If a railway were constructed from Khurasan, either to the Caspian Sea or to the Persian Gulf; large quantities of copper would probably be exported, but it does not pay to carry impure copper by camels or mules to the sea, and there is also a scarcity of wood for smelting. If railways existed coal could be brought from the mines between Tehran and Kasvin, from which the former place is at present supplied. About 20 miles from my camp at Khargosi I saw a range of mountains called Kuh Zir. In these hills I was told that there are many abandoned workings for gold, and on my journey from the Caspian to Tehran I travelled with a Lieutenant-Colonel of Persian Engineers called Sulyman Khan, who had been sent by the Shah to inspect and report upon these abandoned workings for gold in the Kuh Zir. He had spent some time there, but his report must have been unfavourable, for nothing was done to reopen them. My informant at Kharghosi said that though gold could be procured by digging, it was a losing speculation. I know r of three places in Persia where gold ha^t been worked in ancient times, one at Kavend, near Zenjan, which I visited in 1880, the second near Mashad, of which I shall speak later, and the third is this place called Kuh Zir. I halted two days at Gebur, as my horses and mules were knocked up by the long marches I had been making. The country through which I had been passing is quite unsurveyed, a line across the desert with a few names ol places being all that any map shows. No mountains are shown, though there are several ranges of con siderable elevation.On the 8th November, I marched from Gebur. The road crosses a range of hills called Tir Kuh, by a difficult pass. This was the first range I had crossed since leaving Samnan though the road had skirted several. The pass through the Tir Kuh hills would nit be practicable for artillery, excepting mountain guns. There is a road leading round the end of the mountain, which would be passable for artillery; it is, however, longer than the one I used. About ten miles after leaving Gebur a range of quartz hills is seen to the southward, called Jebel Kuh. It is most difficult to get names for mountain ranges in Persia; in fact, they have generally no name for a range of mountains only for the particular peaks, and as the country I was passing through was almost uninhabited, I had a good deal of difficulty in getting the real names. The quartz of these hills showed white in the sun, and reefs of quartz crossed the road. I judged the country through which I was passing to be auriferous, but l could not hear of gold being worked in the neighbourhood. Gold was, I believe, produced in ancient Persia in considerable quantities, and no doubt, with quartz crushing machines, some old workings might be profitably reopened, but the Persian Government is very jealous of European enterprise, especially on the subject of mines. At 20 miles from Gebur I passed the Kal Mura river, or Ab-i-Shmv These names have much the same meaning, both referring to the bitter or salt taste of the water. When I crossed the Kal Mura it was very low, but the bed bore evidence that a large body of water is brought down at certain seasons. This is the same river which is crossed at Pul Abrishami, on the direct Mashad and Tehran road. I tasted the water, which w r as very salt and bitter. The banks were covered with a certain amount of tamarisk scrub, which appeared to flourish in spite of the saltness of the water. Probably, at certain seasons, the water is not so salt and bitter as it then was, but it is always undrinkable. This river is the cause of the great piece of kavir, or salt desert, which extends south ward for many miles. I am informed that the width of this salt desert varies from only a few miles, where it is crossed by caravans on the road from Sabzawar to Yazd, to 60 miles in some places, though I should doubt there being any piece of salt desert so wide as that without being crossed by hills. Salt desert is only formed at the lowest part of a valley. At 26 miles from Gebur I reached a small well of fresh water, where I en camped. There were no inhabitants. This well is known as Zogdi. On the 9th November I marched to Tawrun, distant 22 miles. At 6J miles from Zogdi a spring of brackish water is passed, known as Shur Chah, near which are the ruins of a village. At 10 miles from Zogdi I passed the ruins of another village, called Hyzomi. Here there was plenty of water, and traces of recent cultivation, though the place was deserted. The inhabitants cultivate this ground in spring, leaving as soon as they have reaped their crops. They leave because the place has been so harried by Akhal Tekeh Turkomans as to be too dangerous for permanent habitation, but no doubt both these villages will soon be occupied, now that, thanks to the Russians Turkoman raids in this part of the country are no longer possible. The people I met thought 1 was a Russian, and poured out blessings on the Russians for having delivered their country from the curse of Turkoman raids. At 22 miles from Zogdi a cluster of sma.l hamlets, collectively known as Tawrun, is reached. Tawrun consists of 18 small villages, scattered about a considerable valley. Each hamlet is small, and has high towers and defences against the dreaded Turkoman. The people could hardly realize that they were now for ever free from the curse of Turkoman raiders. Provisions couid only be obtained m very small quantities, as the population is generally very small, and the hamlets are poor ones. w } Kab!n ^ 0Ve ^ er 1 marched 16 miles, to a small well of good water, called alan Chah. Near this well there was another similar one, and here a few Baluch nomads were encamped. Some of them came over to my camp, bringing a sheen which was evidently intended as a present for the Russian, as they believed me to be’ They were loud m their praises of the Russians, and, as soon as they discovei^d that I did no belong to that nation, did not present the sheep. They were the fiTt Baluchk V et 0I V^ P resent i° urne y They said they had bLira year m^luslv campmithe A^ak ^ Gur S a /\ river ’ arid had visited the Russian Th^ P rhJf r Ca r ; Rus , sians had presented their Khan or Chief with a revolver This Chief lives at Anarbat, which I passed on the following day The nar of th;i fZr f^f had been in the habit of plundering travellers on this road, but he declared he had quite given up plundering. I thought it as well, however, to show him that I was well provided with breech-loading arms. He said, “ I know that sort of arms well; I have “ seen them amongst the Russians.” The next day I made a very long march of 32 miles. At 21 miles a small well of good water, called Jahan Mulk, is passed. Here I found a caravan of camels, laden with fruit, proceeding to Shah-rud. Close to this well, as almost in every place where water is found, were the ruins of a copper- smelting furnace, and the copper slag scattered around. At 32 miles from Kalan Chah 1 reached the small village of Kasimabad, where 1 halted for the night. Here is a good kariz, or underground canal, which gives a plentiful supply of water. This is the last village in the Shah-rud district. On the 12th November, I marched 19 miles to Burd Askan. At miles from Kasimabad a small stream, which always contains water, is crossed. Just beyond it, there is a small village called Dahn Kala. At 11 miles, a large and flourishing village, called Anarbat, is reached. This place is celebrated, as its name implies, for its pomegranates, and I was offered twenty-six pounds’ weight of the finest pome granates for ninepence. At Anarbat, Nur Muhammad Khan, the Chief of the Persian Baluchis, resides. I made his acquaintance later at Birjand, where he had proceeded to pay his taxes to the Amir of Kaian. The Baluchis in Persia, wherever they may wander, have to pay their revenue to the Amir of Kaian. Nur Muhammad Khan told me that the Baluchis had not been long resident in Persia, that they been brought from Baluchistan, about 140 years ago byNadir Shah, and settled in Khurasan. He gave me the following list of the clans orme Baluchis resident in Persia :— Khanzaie Mirzazaie Bahmedie Aruf Khanie Allahyarzaie Jelalzaie Bolakani Brahui Families. - 1,000 - 400 - 300 - 400 - 300 - 200 - 200 60 Total 3,060 I believe this estimate of families to be excessive. Three thousand and sixty families, at four to the family, would give 12,240 as the Baluch population of Khurasan, ex clusive of the Baluchis of Sistan, who are not included in the above table. Balueh nomads are found wandering almost all over Khurasan. They are most numerous in the Turshiz, Turbat Haidari, Khaf, and Kaian districts, but a few are found almost everywhere. These people visit the camps of the Jaffirbai Yomuds, and travel to the Gurgan and Atrak rivers. They have also communication with their brethren in Sistan and in Baluchistan, so that it is quite possible that a camp of these nomad Baluchis might at one time be pitched in Russian territory and at another time within the limits of Baluchistan, under British protection. I-need not mention how useful these Baluchis might be found by the Russians for purposes of intrigue. At 17 miles, I passed the village of Mozuffurabad, and after this the country was thickly inhabited, being covered with numerous flourishing villages with plenty of water and wide culti vation, as I had now reached the plain of Turshiz. The Turshiz district is one of the richest in Persia. The Governor of the district, Riza Kuli Khan, lives at Sultanabad. He is the cousin of Mirza Husain Khan Sipah Salar, G.C.S.I., who was at this time Governor General of Khurasan. At the end of nineteen miles after leaving Kasim abad, I reached the large and flourishing village of Burdaskan, where I halted, pitching my tent in a small enclosure which gave some shelter to my horses and mules from the bitter wind which was blowing. The weather was very cold, especially at night, Burdaskan, or Baderaskan, as it is often called, is a large village with a good bazaar. On the 14th, I continued my march over the rich Turshiz plain, passing many villages. After ten miles, I passed the large village of Kundur, where I crossed the track I had followed on my journey of two years ago. If I had follow'ed that road it would have led to Sultanabad, which I had previously seen, and did not wish to enter again, as it was a little off the direct road to Khaf. At 26 miles, I reached the village of Saghabad, where I stayed for the night. The people here were rather uncivil, and I had some difficulty in finding any place wdiere I could pitch my tent a little sheltered 8062 . Bfrom the piercing wind which ^ j S ^^refsedTnorXiarVEuropean dress, asked why I a European before, and thong ‘ . tllin p w [ 1 y they should have thought my was dressed like a 1 urkoman.

As soon as one leaveS g the mam ^ ^ chaff, on which horses are fed are y^ P al , e and passed over a desert piece of I quitted the fruitful part of 7 f r0 ,u Saghabad, I entered a pass country for seven miles At ^out eigh con g ln „ a tion of the Kuh Begun through a low range of Ms I he e hiUs (VoI1 , gaghabad, the village of range. Here I crossed a . sn ' a1 ' place , almost to be described as a Faizabad is reached. It is a tolerably tiounshing pia , . g the chief place The present Governor of Mahwilat is a Kajar prince of the reigning rgal family At Faizibad mv road crossed the route followed by the mission of Sir b. Goldsmid on _ return journey trom Sistan to Mashad. Faizabad is 32 miles from Turbat Hardari The next day, I marched 13 miles across country without any road or even track, to Khairabad, where there are the ruins of a very tine caravanserai, with beautiful encaustic tiles. When I reached Khairabad, I found I was not on the best road to Khaf. my guide having misled me. After a good deal of difficulty I procured a fresh guide and went to a small village called Bushruyeh, which is 28 miles from baizabad. A great deal of opium is grown in this part of the country, and the people were just sowing their poppy seed for the opium crop. I told them that the price of 1 ersian opium had fallen very much in China, and that they would suffer a heavy loss on the crop, as opium cannot he profitably grown in Persia unless the price of opium is high in China, which is the chief market for this drug. The villagers expressed their delight at the prospect of not having to grow poppy. They said that the best land was taken up in growing it, instead of wheat, and that the opium crop paid the landlords, but was not profitable to the tenants, who far preferred to grow a crop of grain. At baizabad I had been received by the people with much pleasure^ as they believed me to he a Russian, and they kept calling down blessings on the Russian Government for its good deed in pre venting Turkoman raids. When I told them I was an Englishman, one of them, who was a man of superior station, and had travelled a little, having visited Bombay, said to me, “ Why is England always the enemy of Persia?” I pointed out sufficiently plainly that this was quite a mistake, and brought unanswerable arguments to prove the con trary. They were unable to reply to the arguments I brought forward, but were not convinced. The idea has been so instilled into them that Russia is their friend and England their enemy, that it is difficult to convince them that they are wrong. Englishmen are so rarely seen in this part of the country, and Russians so much oftener, that they have quite taken up this idea, which has been carefully taught them. On the 17th November I left Bushruyeh, and after about 2^ miles reached a well- beaten track, at the village of Deh Nao, which was the road i ought to have followed, but from which we had wandered away, notwithstanding that we had a guide. From Deh Nao onwards the country is thickly populated, villages being passed at every few miles. Ihe evidences of Turkoman inroads were, however, strongly apparent. I passed two villages, the whole population of which had been either killed or carried off by the Turkomans some three years previously. I made particular inquiries concerning the history of one of these villages, and it was a very instructive one. The people had formerly lived in a strong fort, but finding the times somewhat more quiet, had built 7 • . * nuAimg tut: times somewnar more quiet, had built their houses outside, and allowed the fort to go to ruin, believing that peaceful times had come One day a large body of Turkomans swept over the country, plundering aU the villages that were not strongly fortified. At one of these villages 1 asked how many had been killed. I was told that four men had been killed, and every one else men, women, and children, carried away into slavery. It is not surprising that the Russians, who have in a great measure prevented these Turkoman incursions are looked upon as deliverers. It is most disgraceful to the Persian Government’that 1 urkomans should be able to plunder this part of Persia. In Dannmz and arts of he country close to the Turkoman border, there is some excuse, but The v Male that 1 saw to-dav were nearly 10U miles from the Persian border, and more than 200 mdeJ fiom l any Deh, the nearest place inhabited by Turkomans. Besides the distance theTurkomans coming to this part of the country must go through some mountain pass within Persian territory. These passes could easily be guarded, and if there was the least unanimity amongst the different chiefs guarding the Persian border, the Turko mans would be followed up and cut to pieces on their return journey. A large number of horsemen are kept up, or at least are paid for by the Government, for the defence of this frontier. If the men were properly paid and led, the number might suffice, and one or two sharp lessons would have a very salutary effect upon the Turkomans; but nothing really efficient was done until Russia appeared on the scene, and the Turko mans ravaged this part of the country with perfect impunity. They made their raids, and returned in triumph to their obahs, or camps, on the Murghab, bringing thousands of sheep and many human captives. The Kurds and Turks on the north-eastern frontier sometimes beat them in fair fight, but down here the people, being generally Persian, are very unwarlike, and the most that is done is to pursue them and force them to drop a portion of their plunder, and perhaps some of their captives. Turko mans have, however, a disagreeable habit of either killing or mutilating their captives if hotly pursued, which makes the friends of the captives rather chary of pressing the pursuit too closely. At 22 miles from Bushruyeh 1 halted, at the village of Abusabad. On the road this day I passed the following villages : Allahabad, Haknabad, Kut, Revand, and Rudkar. * On the 18th November I marched 23 miles, to Salami. At miles from Abusabad I passed the small town of Rushkar. It is a poor little place, a great deal of it being in ruins. It, however, has a wall in pretty good repair and a ditch. Rushkar is also sometimes called Khaf-i-Karai, being chiefly inhabited by the Karai tribe. The Karais are the descendants of the Kara-Tartars. The head quarters of the tribe are at Turbat Hidari, in this district; in fact, many of the villages in the neighbourhood are populated by the Karais, who were once a very powerful tribe, and I believe are descendants of the Karait tribes, who served in the Mongol armies. The country here was also thickly inhabited. About 10 miles after leaving my camp of the morning, the Turbat Hidari district ends, and the Khaf district is entered. At 14 miles the strongly fortified village of Nasrabad is passed. Nasrabad is sometimes called Bala Khaf. All the villages in this part of the country have large camps of nomads encamped just outside them. These people are Timuris, a tribe of nomads which has emigrated from the neighbourhood of Herat. Nasrabad is the head-quarters of Lutf Aly Khan Timuri. He is the elder brother of Dervish Aly Khan, the Timuri Chief of Khaf. Lutf Aly Khan was absent from Nasrabad when I passed, and I met him at Khaf later. At 23 miles I reached the village^ of Salami. Great numbers of iliats, or nomads, were encamped here, their black goats’ hair tents, guarded by savage dogs, being scattered in groups around the village. These camps were chiefly composed of men of the Timuri tribe, but a considerable number of Baluchis were also encamped here. Salami has evidently been a large town. There is a high minaret, and a curmus small building in good preservation, the use of which I could not understand. I was told it was called Salami because in the time of the Uzbeg kings the people came here to “ salaam ” to them. The small building to which I allude, being open on all sides, would be suitable for a king to stand or sit in while he received the salutations of an assembled multitude. There are many large narrow stones here, some as much as 12 feet in length, used by the people as gravestones, but this was evidently not their original purpose; they have, I think, been taken out of buildings of which they were probably the lintels and doorposts. I pitched my tent inside the fortified village, as I was afraid some of the Baluch nomads encamped around might take a fancy to some of my horses or mules, and steal them in the night, it I encamped outside. Salami v\as more wretched even than Persian villages ordinarily are. It belongs to the King, and its revenues are used in the payment of the 200 horsemen kept up for the defence of this part of the border, so that it is no one’s interest to repair the wall or to keep the village in any sort of order. The cultivators are oppressed by everybody, and have no one to protect them. Villages that belong to the King personally are always worse off than those belonging to a private landowner. Those belonging to a rich landowner are far better off, as he has a personal interest in their wellbeing. On the 19th November l sent my mirza, or secretary, to Dervish Aly Khan, the Persian Governor of Khaf, asking him to procure me a house for occupation during my stay in that place. Dervish Aly Khan had received no news of my expected arrival from his own Government, but he had heard of it from Mirza Abbas Khan, C.I.E., the British Agent at Mashad, who was his personal friend. Dervish Aly Khan sent out his cousin, Mortuza Khan, with a dozen horsemen, as an “ istikbai.T&gt; &gt;/' ., rt f wplrnme. They came out about three miles to meet me. Amongst the or pait} , |‘i n of the Hindu traders settled at Khat. horsemen was the headma , * 1()Irie8 were ma de that a house could not he pro. • , 717m,-. thai day I was asked to sleep one night at a yillage about a mile and a halnrom The town! m enable a house to be prepared for me. On the 21st I rode mto if i f ■« dmilar narty of horsemen being sent out to meet me, and all the Hindu traders fettled in Kha faying also corne out to welcome me. I was conducted to the quarters provided for me, which were the best the town could furmsh, though they were really P icueh They consisted of three small rooms built round a courtyard. One i g A /» A r. rv^r- fltfi Iritntmn Npvt dnnr roomTvas for myseYf, nnotheVVor m'y servants, and a third for the kitchen. Next door there was an immense palace of a place, mostly &gt;“ bu,lt n ^? U 'f Y courtyard, and with a large tank for water m the middle. This great half-ruined building was also at my disposal, if I could have used it, but I only used two rooms, one of which had formerly been a prison, as stables. The room I myself occupied was a mere open shed, the front being filled in with open lattice work, closed by wooden shutters There was no glass in the windows, and if I wanted light 1 had to open the wooden shutters and sit by the open window. It was rather trying in the winter which was considerably colder than an English winter. But Dervish Aly Khan had given me the best place he had, and was most civil. I sent to ask what time I should call upon him, he answered that he wished to visit me first. He came about an hour after my arrival, accompanied by his elder brother, Luti Aly Khan, who had come from Nasrabad and was on a visit. Dervish Aly Khan is the Chief of the Peisian branch of the Timuri tribe, and is Governor of the Khaf district. He is a most in telligent man, knows something about Europe generally, and a-great deal about Russia. He one day told me the story of Peter the Great, and his travels in search of instruction in England and other countries. After staying about an hour they went away. I found that the family of Sardar Ayub Khan, consisting of two wives, was here, having fled from Herat when it was occupied by Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan. Ayub Khan himself was at Gazik, in the Kaian district of Persia. He had with him about a thousand of his most faithful followers, almost all horsemen, and more of his followers were scattered about the Perso-Afghan, border. Sardar Hashim Khan, with the wife and daughter of Amir Shere Aly Khan, was also with him, as also a young son of Shere Aly Khan, named Abdul Raman Jan. Dervish Aly Khan was very anxious that Ayub Khan and his followers should not come to Khaf, as they were a very turbulent set, and the beaten Afghan army was very unruly and hard to keep in any sort of order. Also, if Ayub Khan should come, Dervish Aly Khan would have to feed him and all his followers gratis for at least two or three days, costing a con siderable sum of money, which he could ill afford. He had to make a large present to Mirza Husain Khan Sipah Salar, G.C.S.I., as an offering to that individual on his being appointed Governor General of Khurasan, and had not much to spare, as Khaf is a poor district and the revenue assessment very high. Dervish Aly Khan sent a messenger to me to tell me privately that he had sent out horsemen to watch Ayub Khan’s movements, and that when Ayub Khan approached he would leave the town on a shooting excursion, and asked me to accompany him, as he was anxious lest any evil should befall me during his absence, from the unruly followers of Ayub Khan. He warned me the last time I saw him that there would be, he considered, a good deal of risk in my remaining in the town during his absence, as Khaf has no garrison of Persian troops, beyond a small number of mounted militia. I was very unwilling to leave the town, but considered I was bound to accept the warning given me by Dervish Aly Khari, and not to increase his difficulties, which were already considerable, by insisting upon staying in the town during Avub Khan’s visit. ' ° * About 40 of Ayub Khan’s followers were already here, in attendance upon his wives, and these men we.e very angry because Dervish Aly Khan gave me the best place he had turning Ayub Khan’s wives into another house to make room for me. On the Hth December Dervish Aly Khan and I proceeded to a village called Mangab, weT e;t i'l /r OI ?r K,,a . f ’.° n Sh00ting excur3iori - Thi s place was nearly as wen situated as Khaf for getting information, while it had the advantage of not being nfested by a large body of defeated Afghan soldiers. In this village the Khan had built himself a very nice upper-storied house, which we occupied, but as the doors and windows had not yet been put m, and the weather was bitterly cold, with a sharp frost our quarters were not luxurious. Dervish Aly Khan, however, did all in his power to ma„e my stay with him pleasant, and furnished me with all the information hereceived. On the 17th December Sardar Ayub Khan arrived at Khaf, with about 700 followers, of sorts, hut chiefly cavalry. They were most unruly, and kept the little town in a state of turmoil during their stay. They broke open the door of the place in Khaf where my horses had been left, they abused and threatened some of my servants, but they did no actual harm, and were ejected, after some difficulty, by a party of the Governor’s servants. Ayub Khan was most anxious to stay in Khaf until after the vernal equinox, as Khaf, being so very near the Persian frontier, was well situated for intriguing with Herat. He declared that he had 2,000 horsemen scattered about the country, though this was an exaggeration, and that he had a promise that 2,000 horsemen would join him as soon as he crossed the frontier, and that one of the gates of Herat would be opened for him on his appearing before that place. At this time Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan, the Governor of Herat, had only a small number of Kabul troops with him, and the fidelity of his Herati soldiers m case Ayub Khan appeared before that place, would have been more than doubtful. Dervish Aly Khan wrote to Ayub Khan to tell him that the orders of the Persian Government were that he should proceed to Mashad, or else quit the country, and that after seven days no provisions would be supplied to him or his followers, even on payment. Sardar Ayub Khan was very angry, and sent an insolent message, saying he would sooner fight than leave Khaf. Of course this was mere braggadocio, and Ayub Khan left Khaf on the 23rd December, in high dudgeon, declaring that he would let it be known in Mashad how Dervish Aly Khan and his Englishman were behaving. The greater number of Ayub Khan’s followers, however, did not leave Khaf until the 25th December, on which day I returned to that place. During my absence, from the 14th to the 25th, I had visited Lutf Aly Khan, the elder brother of Dervish Aly Khan, who resides at Nasrabad. While Sardar Ayub Khan was at Khaf he received a letter from the Russian Consular Ao-ent in Mashad, probably in answer to one sent by him. Amongst his followers were Sardar Hashim Khan, Sardar Ahmad Aly Khan, who is a grandson of Amir Sher Aly Khan, and Naib Hafizulla Khan, who is said to be his most able adviser. Ayub Khan felt that in leaving Khaf he was giving up his last chance of again attacking Herat ; and that his followers looked upon it in the same light was proved by a large number of them leaving him and going hack to Afghanistan as soon as the move towards Mashad was decided on. His presence so near Herat was most objectionable. Even at Gazik, where he was when I first arrived on this frontier, he was not in so threatening a position as at Khaf, Gazik not being near any place of importance in Afghanistan. Great excitement was caused in Herat by the arrival of Ayub Khan at Khaf. The garrison of Ghurian was increased from 200 to 500 men, the garrison of Kusan was also increased, and horsemen were sent to watch all along the frontier line of Afghanistan. Two horsemen were actually sent into Khaf itself to bring news at once of Ayub Khan’s movements. Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan was very anxious. As soon as Avub Khan had left Khaf for Mashad, and had dismissed or been deserted by a large number of his followers, which happened on his leaving that place, affairs at Herat settled down, as the partisans of Ayub Khan saw that, at least for a time, their chance Ayub Khan, before leaving Khnf, and after receiving a letter from the Russian Consular Agent at Mashad, told his followers that he intended only to remain until the vernal equinox in Mashad, and would then proceed to Askabad and seek Russian protection that he had a treaty with Russia, and preferred to go to Askabad rather than to Tehran. He said that he hoped to obtain by Russian assistance a position of influence amongst the Tekeh Turkomans of Merv, and then to use the Turkomans as a means of again getting possession of Herat. This was a very wild idea, but it undoubtedly was the idea prevailing in the mind of Ayub Khan when he started for Mashad; and that it was not carried out was, 1 believe, due to the fact that he did not receive encouragement from the Russian Agent at Mashad about proceeding to Askabad. After his arrival at Mashad he was in communication with the Russian Agent and was, I am told, informed that he might proceed to Askabad, but no encouragement was given him to do so, and no hopes of assistance from Russia were held out to him. After leaving Khaf Ayub Khan went in four marches to 1 urbat Hidari, where he stayed for a short time and then went on to Mashad. . Sartip Nur Muhammad Khan remained at Khaf with about 70 horsemen. He is known to be one of the cleverest and most intriguing chiefs of Afghanistan and he separated himself from Ayub Khan as rats leave a sinking ship. Amir Abdur Rahman Khan would do well not to permit Sartip Nur Muhammad khan to return to Afghanistan, as he is very hostile to him, and would always be plotting miscbiel. 8 U 62 . C10 Sardar Hasan Khan, a reTun^o at Khai feart^P * ur ' ^ |desirab i e that they should do so.

The rumour as to European soldiers or others being held in slavery u„ atarted bv Pahlwan Khan, a sepoy in Jacob s Rifles, whose state- u 4 t the battle of Maiwand I was made a prisoner by the Ghazis. With me were m made prisoners four privates of Her Majesty’s 66th Regiment, and two sepoys of the 1st Grenadiers. The two sepoys and myself were Muhammadans. 1 he same day we seven men were handed over by the Ghazis to the custody of one of the Herati regiments. We remained with the above regiment as prisoners for three days, but were not tied up. A havildar and three men of the Herati regiment were placed as sentries over us. On the fourth day the Ghazis who had seized us came to the Sardar commanding the above-named Herati regiment, and said that as they had taken us (seven men) prisoners in battle, they intended to make slaves of us. To this proposal the commandant of the regiment agreed. I was given as a slave to a Sardar (zemindar) who lives three marches on the Herat side of Giriskb. I do not know his name. The two sepoys of the Grenadiers were given as slaves to a Sardar (zemindar) from the Karan direction. I do not know what became of the four privates of the 66th Regiment. They were not then slaves. I do not know if they were made slaves afterwards; no mention of it was made in my hearing. They may have been killed for all I know. I was then separated from the four privates and from the two sepoys. I started as a slave with my master, and on arrival at his place, three marches on the other side of Giriskh, I was employed to graze his flocks. I was constantly beaten during the six months I served as a slave. Even the women heat me. I was constantly on the look out to escape. At last, at the end of six months, fortunately for me a son of my master died. During the weeping, and while the funeral ceremonies were being carried out, I was forgotten, and I succeeded, in the confusion, in making my escape. I travelled all night with nothing to eat except some grains of corn, about a seer' which I had with me, and reached the banks of the Helmund the next evening I remained begging my subsistence for some 15 to 20 days in the neighbourhood of Khushk-i-Nakhud. 1 have never heard what happened to the two Grenadier sepoys or to the four privates before alluded to. I did not see any other prisoners either sepoys or British soldiers, in the hands of the victorious army I slowlv* begging my way, came from Khushk-i-Nakhud to Shurawak. I had a' seven daW march across an uncultivated sand desert. I came with a kafila. From Shurawak T went to Sherod, and thence towards Kalat. I meant to go to Quetta, but missed mv road I then came to Bagh and got into the railway at Bell Put. 1 was absent about eight months. Above is a true and full statement of all that happened to me” My messenger had a letter to Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan, the Governor of Herat fhe letter was of a complimentary character, congratulating him on hTs success T told my servant not to mention to Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan tW I, succt ' 5S ; 1 the purpose of inquiring about slaves, but, while be was waitina T rl, Sent f ° 1 ' mv letter, to make inomrips n C IP Jawk™ _ 1 as &gt; I aitin S ior the answer to i at ' piKuntiis, txctpi -Lieutenant Maclean had Imtin f/ , battle.

This gave him a o-ood ODnortunitv a L -V ? le £ rea test considera- Pahlwan Khan. I also, at Khaf, caused inquiries t™Te' made 'fronf'tl Sep ° y Ayuh Khan as to whether anv orisoners bar! Hppm e i . t. t . * {0m the followers of that they knew of no ^ M They said that if any prisoners haH liotw, . AP Lieutenant Maclean. oot have been except natives ofinquiries at Herat, he could find no corroboration whatsoever for Pahlwan Khan’s statement that he or any one else had been sold as a slave. Pahlwan Khan’s state ment is, I feel confident, unworthy of credence, and was only invented to account for his long absence. The whole story is so opposed to Afghan customs and ways, with which, from more than 20 years’ experience of Afghans, I am well acquainted, that I put no faith in it whatsoever. My messenger heard a story in Herat, and I have myself heard the story from others, which may have helped to spread the idea that prisoners, besides Lieutenant Maclean, were taken after the battle of Maiwand. It was to the effect that a few days after Maiwand a Musulman sepoy of the English was captured by some Afghans, who were about to kill him, when he said, “ If you will “ swear to spare my life, I will tell you where three or four Englishmen are hidden.” They swore to spare his life, and he then took them to a kariz, or dry underground canal, where he showed them that four Englishmen were hidden. The sepoy, it is said, had been in hiding with them, and had gone out to look about. The Englishmen were taken out and killed, and the sepoy was liberated, as they had sworn not to kill him. Later, at Birjand, I also heard this story myself from some of Ayub Khan’s followers, but they said they had only heard it as a rumour that four Europeans found in a kariz had been killed by Kakari Afghans, and not by soldiers. Perhaps Pahlwan Khan had heard this, and concocted his story from it. I also heard later that the lives of one or two Musulman sepoys were spared after Maiwand, but they were not treated as prisoners, and, after remaining some time with the troops, were allowed to go. Ayub Khan and his principal Sardars, however, utterly denied that they knew of any prisoner having been spared after Maiwand, except Lieutenant Maclean. The sepoys who accompanied Ayub Khan spuke much of Lieutenant Maclean. They said he was brought in bound, with his hands behind his back, to Ayub Khan, who released him from his bonds and placed him under a guard, and that Ayub Khan used often to send for him and talk with him. One day, when, he was with Ayub Khan, the heads of a number of Englishmen were brought in. This apparently happened on the day that the sortie from Kandahar was repulsed. Lieutenant Maclean recognized one of the heads as that of a friend, and said he was a person of some importance. The Afghans would say this if it had been the head of any officer. Lieutenant Maclean was much affected by the sight of these heads, and shed tears, saying he wished he had died with them. After this day, though Ayub Khan repeatedly sent for Lieutenant Maclean to speak with him, he refused to go to him. On the day of the defeat of Ayub Khan’s army by the forces under General Roberts, Ayub Khan, when he found he had lost the battle, sent for Lieutenant Maclean for the purpose of taking him with him to Herat, but he found that he had been murdered by the guard of seven men placed over him. I think it is as certain as anything of the kind can ever be, that no European prisoners, except Lieutenant Maclean, remained alive after Maiwand. My presence at Khaf had decidedly been of use, as, had I not been present, the Persian Governor would never have had the courage to bring strong pressure to bear upon Ayub Khan to force him to move further into Persia, and I have no doubt that he would have remained lor a considerable time longer at Khaf, under various excuses, with the object of attempting the recovery of Herat. Chapter II. State of Herat, and account of Sardar Abdul Kudus Khans capture of that place. During the latter part of the rule of Ayub Khan at Herat, after his return from Kandahar, when defeated by Sir Frederick Roberts, great oppression was committed. His Afghan soldiers were quite out of hand, and did exactly what they liked. The population of Herat dwindled down to perhaps 10,000, the people flying from oppres sion to the neighbouring villages. Herat, though strongly fortified, is quite a small town. It is surrounded by many flourishing villages, hut the population of the villages near Herat also fled to places further off, to avoid the oppression of Ayub Khan. Many large bodies of Aimaks, as the nomads of the Herat district are called, took refuge in Persia. The nomads who entered Persia were chiefly of the Timuri or Hazara tribes, as many nomads of these tribes were previously settled in Persia. Ayub Khan had to make a very great effort to get together troops for his second expedition to Kandahar, when he defeated Amir Abdur Rahman Khan’s troops. During his first expedition to Kandahar, when he defeated our troops at Maiwand, he left Abdul Wahab Khan, the son of Sardar Mir Afzul Khan, as Governor of Herat. Abdul Wahab Khan, though he was forced by the necessities of his position to exact12 money from the an^alt'good‘dTal' of 'on- Sardar Abdnl Wahab Khan ex du;on to Kandahar, he left the versation with 'nm. 1 , „ rnor (-[, e rea | governor being Khushdil Khan.

At a place called Parsi, there are about 1 femilies under a chief called Ata Khan, who is the son-in-law of An na Khan. Abdul Wahah’Khan, while Governor of Tiwarah, was at enmity with Anbia Khan on,! thp nomads of the neighbourhood. T will here describe the advance of Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan from Mazai-i-bheri , near Balkh to Herat. When Ayub Khan had taken Kandahar from the troops of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan, and the Amir was himself advancing on Kandahar to retake that place, orders were sent by the Amir to Ishak Khan, the Governor of Afghan Turkistan, to make a diversion towards Herat against Ayub Khan, so as to raise the nomad tribes of the mountain country between Turkistan and Herat. These tribes were as a whole, hostile to Ayub Khan. He had put to death Khan Aga, the chief of the Jamshedis, and Yalantush Khan, son of Khan Aga, who succeeded his father as Chief fled first to Panj Deh, to the Saruk Turkomans, and later took refuge at Maimana, Ayub Khan had also put to death, about the same time, Jahandad Khan, the Chief of the Kipchak tribe, who lived near Obeh, to the eastward of Herat. Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan, when he left Mazar-i-Sherif, had at first with him only four squadrons of Turkistan horse, amongst whom there was a troop of Eyrsari Turkomans. A regiment of infantry, and, I believe, two guns (probably mountain guns), followed him under Sardar Mohsin Khan, the brother of Ishak Khan. The country travelled over by Abdul Kudus Khan from Mazar-i-Sherif to Herat is a very difficult one. His route was as follows :— Mazar-i-Sherif to,— Deh Dadi - - - 4 miles. Oyin Karah - - 16 „ Ak Kupry, or Pul-i-Safid - 12 „ Zahri - - - - 20 „ Umruk - - - - 16 „ Ab-i-Nik - - - 24 „ Talkab - - - - 28 • „ Ashka Maidan, or Kashan - 24 Sar-i-Jangal. Kundeh Sukhta. Dowlut Yar. Gaur, or Gaurat Tiwarah - It bears both names. fThis is “in the country of Gaur,” \ or Goor. { Also in the Gaurat, where it is in habited by Taymunies. Here he fought with Abdul Wahab Khan. Where he fought with Abdul Salam Khan, a cousin of Ayub Khan. { Hissar - Obeh. Herat. Sardar Abdul Kudus appeared at Tiwarah at an opportune moment, shortly after the defeat of Ayub Khan at Kandahar by the Amir. Anbia Khan, with a large body of Taymunys, joined him. Abdul Wahah Khan, Governor for Sardar Ayub Khan of the principal fort in Tiwarab, was not very faithful to Ayub Khan. He was disgusted at not having been left as Governor of Herat, as he had been on Ayub Khan’s previous expedition to Kandahar. Secondly, his father, Sardar Mir Afzul Khan, who wasliving in Persia, and had refused to join Ayub Khan, had written to him, begging him to throw in his lot with the party of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan against Ayub Khan. To add to these reasons for joining Abdul Kudus Khan, news was received in Herat about this period of the utter defeat of Ayub Khan by the Amir, near Kandahar, and that the prince with his army was in full flight. I am not quite certain that the news of Ayiib Khan’s defeat had reached Tiwarah at the moment of Abdul Kudus Khan’s arrival there, but the probability is that it had. These reasons were quite sufficient to induce Abdul Wahab Khan, after a mere show of resistance, to join Abdul Kudus Khan. Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan, thus reinforced, marched towards Obeh, and at a place called Hissar, between Tiwarah and Obeh, a serious fight took place between the troops of Abdul Kudus Khan and some troops who had hurriedly been sent out from Herat to oppose him. Abdul Salam Khan, a distant cousin and violent partisan of Ayub Khan, was wounded in eleven places, taken prisoner, and sent to Ishak Khan in Turkistan, and by him forwarded on to the Amir at Kabul. This man, after recovering from his wounds, was ordered by the Amir to leave Afghanistan, and arrived at Mashad while I was there, in August 1882, where he held forth to all who would listen to him on the atrocities committed by the English in Kabul. His stories were purely imaginary. He seems to have had a very vivid imagination, and he certainly gave it rein, and unfortunately was believed in Mashad, even by people who should have known better. Though an effort was made to keep the defeat of Ayub Khan secret as long as possible at Herat, it soon became known, and when, after the fight near Obeh, Abdul Kudus Khan appeared before Herat, the gates were thrown open and he was invited to enter. The Loweh Naib, Khu?hdil Khan, with Musa Jan, the young son of Amir Yakub Khan, fled direct to Mashad, finding that all opposition to Abdul Kudus Khan was hopeless. Sardar Ayub Khan was near Farrah, on his way to Herat, when he heard that the town had been captured by his enemies. He collected all the money he could, and fled, via Anardara, to Gazik and Tabbas Sunikhaneh, two places on the Afghan border, in the Kaian district of Persia. Here he remained for some time, until pressure was brought to bear upon him by the Persian Government to move on to Mashad. He marched up by the frontier road from Tabbas Sunikhaneh to Khaf, where he arrived on the 17th December. For a long time the position of Abdul Kudus Khan at Herat was a very dangerous one. He had no troops beyond one weak regiment of infantry and two guns which had arrived under Sardar Mohsin Khan from Turkistan, and four troops of irregular cavalry which had originally started with him from Mazar-i-Sherif. Besides these troops he had a large body of irregular horsemen supplied him by the Taymuny and Hazara tribes, but these men were not to be trusted. He had also some Herat! troops who had deserted to him from Ayub Khan, but the only troops in whom he could put confidence were those that had come from Turkistan. The very name of Afghan is hateful to all Heratis, and though the nomads of Herat had helped him to oust the partisans of Ayub Khan, they were not trustworthy, and if Ayub Khan had appeared before Herat, it is probable that a large number of Firuz Kuhis and others would have joined him. The Amir lost a great deal of time before he reinforced Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan with Afghan troops from Kandahar, and even when they were sent, there was considerable delay at Farrah, because Sardar Muhammad Yusuf Khan, the uncle of the Amir, wished to be Governor of Herat, and to go on there with the troops which he had brought on as far as Farrah, of which place he was appointed Governor. Sardar Moshin Khan, the brother of Sardar Ishak Khan, who had come to Herat from Turkistan, was also disgusted at not being appointed Governor of Herat, and went off to Kandahar, to try to press his claims on the Amir. While all this confusion was reigning at Herat, Ayub Khan was living close to the Persian frontier, and intriguing with his followers on the Afghan side of the border. When I arrived at Khuf, things were still in a very critical state at Herat, and it was most urgent that Ayub Khan should be got away to Mashad, and there is no doubt my presence did considerably hasten the carrying out ol the orders which had been sent by the Persian Government for-his proceeding to Mai-had, but which orders Ayub Khan was very much inclined to disobey, and the Persian Governors of the border were not at all in a hurry to carry out the directions of the central Government, except in a most leisurely manner. Abdul Kudus Khan, knowing his weakness, did all in his power to conciliate the Heratis. He assembled the merchants and traders, and said to them, “ I wish to rule you justly, and 1 am “ answerable to God that there shall be no oppression.” From his Herati regiments he weeded out all the old and worn-out men, and enlisted a number 8062 .

It lias, however, increased th expenditure of the Herat district considerably, and difficulties might after a time arise about the payment of these horsemen, as the Amir might not approve ot a large permanent extra expenditure, and if pay was not forthcoming there would be Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan is a tall thin young man, about 29 years of age, and is more of a soldier than of an administrator. He does not care much for the civil duties of his Government, but spends his time in drilling his troops and practising his artillery. When he captured Herat he found the city wall in a deplorable state of repair, and the ditch half filled up. He collected or had made many thousands of pickaxes and spades for the purpose of clearing out the ditch and repairing the wall, and during the summer of 1882 he proposed to levy a large number of labourers for the work. He was also going to repair the Afghan outpost at Kafir Kala, and make it a strong place. This Kafir Kala is on the direct route between Herat and Mashad, just within the Afghan boundary, and not far from the Hari Rud. I received most deplorable accounts of the ruined state of the interior of the town of Herat. I was assured that three houses out of every four w r ere in ruins and uninhabited. It had never recovered the blow received some three years before, when Ayub Khan’s Herat and Afghan troops fought, the Afghan troops having on that occasion thoroughly plundered the city. Abdul Kudus Khan did his very best to induce the people to return and take up their abode in their deserted homes, but confidence in everything Afghan had been so thoroughly shaken that he had many difficulties to contend with. Abdul Kudus Khan encouraged the people to sow a large breadth of land and to increase the amount of cultivation. A great portion of the Herat district, fit for cultivation, had been allowed to lie fallow for some years, in consequence of the constant state of anarchy which had existed. Abdul Kudus Khan tried also to strengthen his position by marrying several wives, the daughters of men of influence. Amongst these was a daughter of Muhammad Khan, the chief of the Hazaras of Kala Nau, and this particular marriage, so far from helping Abdul Kudus Khan, got him into hot water. The Hazara and Firuz Kuhi tribes were not friendly, and Muhammad Khan, the chief of the Hazaras, having obtained a good deal of influence with Abdul Kudus Khan by giving him his daughter in marriage, thought it a good opportunity of showing his power. The Firuz Kuhi chief, Fattahula Beg, had not come in to Herat and was supposed to be favourable to Ayub Khan. Fattahula Beg, when summoned seeing that Muhammad Khan vvas in favour, declined to come, though it does not appear that he was really hostile to the Amir’s Government.

San ’ and tlle a PPomtment of the Shah’s brother to theChapter III. Journey from Rui Khaf to Mohsinabad, and some way up the Hari Rud River. In February 1882, a small party of Persian cavalry, under a Persian major, were sent from Mashad by the Rukn-ud-Dowlah, the Governor General of Khurasan, to inquire into the truth of a statement made by Ayub Khan that I was building' a strong fort at Kbaf, and had a thousand men from Herat to help me in the work. I need hardly say this proved to be quite untrue, and that I built nothing whatsoever; but this was a trick of Ayub Khan to repay me for having caused his removal from khaf. I did know that Persian governors were often very stupid, but I should have thought that the Rukn-ud-Dowlah, the Shah’s brother, who knows me, would have had more sense than to believe such a statement. On the 14th March I proceeded to Karat, the frontier place of the Khaf district. A fine fort has been built at Karat; it had been deserted for many years, but 14 years ago the Persian Government allowed a sum of 1,000 tomans (a toman is worth Is. 6&lt;/.) for rebuilding it. The Governor of Khaf at that time was Attaulla Khan Timuri. He raised a levy of the people of the Khaf district, and proceeded to Karat and built the present fort, which, though not large, is the best and strongest I have seen in Khurasan. Karat is 22 miles from Khaf, situated in a small valley across the range of hills which forms the boundary between Bakharz and Khaf. The building of this fort has been a great check to Turkoman raiding in the Khaf and Kaian districts, though it has not prevented it altogether. Karat w^as, until August 1881, under the Governor of the Khaf district, but in that month a raid was made by a party of Turkomans on a Timuri nomad camp near Karat, and 40 men, women, and children, and two large flocks of sheep were carried off. I passed near and saw the hill from which they had been taken. Though it is less than nine miles from Karat, the news of what had taken place did not reach that place until two days had elapsed, and did not reach Khaf until the fourth day, when, of course, pursuit of the Turkomans was • useless. Sipah Salar Muhammad Husain Khan, G.C.S.I., who was then Governor General of the Khurasan province, took a very serious view of the conduct of the Governor of the Khaf district in not having prevented this raid, and, as a punishment, transferred the Karat fort to the custody of the Governor of the neighbouring district of Bakharz. As Karat was built by the Timuri tribe and was chiefly inhabited by them, Dervish Aly Khan, of Khaf, felt the loss very deeply, and used all his influence in Tehran to get the place again made over to him. On the hill above the fort of Karat there are the ruins of a strong fort and of a considerable town. On a lower mound, just below the old fort, there are the ruins of a mosque with a very fine brick minar, or pillar, which can be ascended by an interior staircase, still in good preservation. This minar is built in two stages. The foundations have sunk in consequence of the weight of the super, structure, and the minar, especially the upper portion of it, slopes at a considerable angle, giving it somewhat the appearance of the leaning tower at Pisa. Near the minar are the ruins of a fine brick caravanserai, a portion of the front of which had been faced by fine marble slabs covered by inscriptions. These marble slabs had been removed and employed as an edging to a tank in a place used as a mosque in the fort of Karat. The mollah, or priest, said it was wrong to walk over inscribed stones, so the inscriptions had been carefully erased with a chisel. On a small piece of marble which was used as a step in a water mill close by, I was able to trace some letters, but the only complete word appeared to be “ Ghuri.” The fort of Karat contains about a hundred and twenty inhabitants, and is in charge of Mir Panj Yusuf Khan Hazara, the Governor of the Bakharz district. “ Mir Panj is a rank in the Persian army, corresponding to our Brigadier-General. It is really one who commands five battalions, but in Persia the title is often given to people who have no actual military command. 1 halted on the loth March at Karat, and taking a small escort of horsemen who had been furnished me by the Governor of Khaf, I rode out to the village of Firizneh, the last inhabited place on Persian soil. From Firizneh I had a good view of the mountain ranges which run out towards Ghurian. I saw and took the bearings of the hill of Sang-i-Dokhtur, which is in Afghan territory, near Ghurian. It is called Sang-i-Dokhtar because there is a large stone placed on end on the top of the hill, which is said to have been carried up by a young woman. Of course this is a mere fable, as the stone is very large, and could not be moved by any human being. I also saw the Do Shakh peak, a con spicuous mountain beyond Ghurian. The country between Firizneh, the last village in Persia, and Sherabad, the first village on Afghan soil, is quite uninhabited, though16 »,„„,««f it i. M..- «r —-“-i JZtXZj'SS ESSrt KolLKtlSl town which has only lately been finished, where Yusuf Khan, mv visit by tbe Commander of that place. I passed through the villages of Farman- T d tlSofI“ttU itrtTS h—t^io^d, as it is'the last'inhabited place in Persia on the direct road from ^Mashadto^Herat.^A large number of horsemen under command of a nephew of Yusuf Khan was sent out to meet me and escort me into Mohsinabad, where I was received with all civility by Yusuf Khan Hazara. He is a very fine looking old man who has led a most ad ven turous life, having been sometimes a subject of 1 ersia, and sometimes a subject of the Afghans. The Hazaras, who now live at Mohsinabad, were brought from Herat, in 1857 by Sultan Murad Mirza Hissam-i-Sultaneh, when he had to give up Heiat .o the Afghans, according to the treaty with England. Formerly these Hazaras had inhabited Bakharz, but had left Persia about fifty-six years ago, and settled in Afghanistan, from which they were brought back. Kala Nau, north-east of Herat, is, however, the original seat of these Hazaras, where they were settled by one ot the Usbeg kings several centuries ago. Bakharz, though originally Persian, has some- times belonged to Afghanistan. Yusuf Khan Hazara, who is 78 years of age, is still very hale and hearty, and even now a very dashing horseman and swordsman. He is quite a picture of a border freebooting chief, and has spent his life in fighting Turkomans or other foes. He is alternately in favour and disgrace with the Persian Government. For some time after they were brought from Herat, he and his Hazaras were settled in Isfaryin, south of Bujnurd; about seven year’s ago he was permitted to come, with about 500 families of his tribe, and settle at Mohsinabad, where he was allowed to build the present small town, and given 3,000 tomans to help him in building the fort. It is not a strong place, but the presence of 500 families of Hazaras so near the border is a great check on Turkoman raids. The Hazaras are brave men, and not like the ordinary border cavalry, who carefully avoid any meeting with Turkomans, but these men, like the Kurds and Turks of Daragez and Kuchan, meet the Turkomans on quite equal terms. Yusuf Khan Hazara showed me nine Turkoman prisoners whom he had caught raiding, and kept down a dry well. I knew that Central Asiatic Chiefs kept prisoners down dry wells, but I had not heretofore seen prisoners so confined. They were very heavily ironed, having both leg irons and neck chains. They were allowed to walk about the fort, the weight of their chains preventing any attempt to run away, but towards evening they were always put down the well, and kept there till broad daylight. The well had a room built over it, the door of which was locked, and watched by a sentry. The well itself had a wooden cover, which was locked at night. Ruffians as these men were, captured redhanded on a slaving expedition, I could not but be sorry for them. They were also very badly fed, the only food supplied them being 6^ pounds of bread a day amongst the nine, but they were permitted to and got a little more food in this way. I was told that they had formerly been well fed, but it was found that their quarters were so comfortable that they would not ask their friends to ransom them. The ransoms demanded for these men w ? ere far higher than I had been accustomed to in Daragez, where from 30 to 100 tomans was the usual ransom, so much as 100 being rarely demanded. The ransom placed upon them was, however, from 100 to 200 tomans each. One of them was a man of influence in the Merv country, being nephew of Kaushid Khan, who built the fort that bears his name. These prisoners begged me to pay their ransom, but 1 declined to do so. The portion of the Hazara tribe which is settled in Persia is said to number 3 000 families, but I should doubt there being so many. Some of these are still in Isfarvin • a large number, under the son of Mir Panj Yusuf Khan, are settled near Mashad • a“&lt;i abou 500 families live m Bakharz. They are a branch of the great Hazara tribe, which is ftmiid scattered over all the more mountainous and least accessible parts of Afghanistan The tribe is also sometimes called Mongol and Barbari. Their own account*of them' thlr^ l&gt;; thdt t ‘ e - V fro '' ,lie borders of China, in the time of Chingiz Khan and !\h * iT Were °TV a,I . y 8 1 , . t,ed n , ear at0 '' u oaHed Kandab, in ChineJ’-iw. '.’ should veiy much doubt this. 1 hey are undoubtedly of Turanian figures, beardless faces,and crooke.reyerpiaVtdainfSTarta^lZod^Hn •i' 6 ”' 8qUat curious thing that all Hazaras, whenever found wM.ef b, Afcbf, il Vely Turkt. speaking people, do not speak Tartar dialects, but always some form ofPeS.17 n3i) i v 7 Also, they are generally of the Shiah sect of Muhammadans, and not Sunis, like other inhabitants of Afghanistan. The idea prevails among philologists that the ancient inhabitants of Persia were in large part Turanian, and that the Persian Aryans were emigrants from Balkh, and the Apeia, of the Greeks, namely, the country near the Hari Rud. I do not think, if the emigration of the Hazaras from Tartary had been so recent as the time of Chingiz Khan that they would have adopted Persian as their language so entirely as they have done. Their doing so is the more re markable when they are found speaking Persian while settled among the Pushtu speaking tribes of Afghanistan, or among the Turki-speaking tribes of Afghan Turkistan. It is true that some of the Hazara tribes settled in the country towards Maimana can speak a form of Turki, or perhaps Mongol, but I believe they all look upon Persian as their native tongue, and are bilingual, as are the people of Daragez and many parts of the north-eastern border of Persia. One of the great divisions of the Hazaras is called Nakudari or Nagudari, and form the largest of all trie Hazara tribes. 1 have no doubt that they are the same people as those mentioned by the historian, Mirkhond, who refers to disorders caused by them about the year 1319. They are also mentioned by the Emperor Baber, as tribes settled in the neighbourhood of Ghur, which is not far from their present abode. About 4,000 families of Hazaras are settled at Kala Nau, on the Upper Murghab, under Muhammad Khan Hazara. The 3,000 families in Persia and the 4,000 families at Kala IS au are very nearly allied, the Persian Hazaras having originally come from Kala Nau. These Persian and Kala Nau Hazaras have for a long period been separated from the rest of their tribe. They have become Suni Muhammadans, from having long resided among the Afghans. Yusuf Khan Hazara and his men in Bakharz are very doubtful in their loyalty to the Persian Government. They are very unwisely treated, at one moment in high favour, and the next distrusted and bullied. While I was staying at Mohsinabad, a dress of honour was brought for Mir Panj Yusuf Khan, sent by the Prince Governor of Khurasan with the most flattering messages, but a few days afterwards he was disgraced and deprived of the governorship of Bakharz. Mir Panj Yusuf Khan, though a brave and dashing border chief, has a very bad character, and he and his Hazaras are generally credited, I believe, with a good deal of truth, with all the murders and robberies that take place in their neighbourhood. I am assured that the insecurity ot the road between Kariz, the Persian outpost, and Kusan, the Afghan outpost, on the Mashad and Herat road, though attributed to Turkomans, might more justly be attributed to Yusuf Khan and his followers. He is said to receive his share of all robberies com mitted hv his men. . . . Mohsinabad is a far better place for getting information of what is happening in Afghanistan than even Khaf, and if it was again thought necessary to station a British officer on this frontier, I would recommend his residing at Mohsinabad, rather than Khaf. Yusuf Khan was not on friendly terms with Mirza Abbas Khan, the British Agent at Mashad, Mirza Abbas Khan having repeatedly had to bring his conduct to the notice of the Persian authorities, for having supplied iron, gun caps, and other munitions of war to Ayub Khan, when the export of these aiticles had been foi bidden bv the Persian Government. Yusuf Khan told me I might go anywhere I liked, and that the 70 horsemen of his own tribe that he had in the fort were entirely at my service, as an escort to accompany me in any direction. I accepted his offer only so far as to take 13 men with me, and ride as far down the course of the Hari Bud as I could go with the possibility of returning the same day. I frst rode from Mohsinabad to a fine brick caravanserai, on the western, or Persian bank of the Hari Rud, called Toman Aga, or Pesh Robat. The caravanserai is situated on the old road along which traffic between Bokhara and Persia was carried on, and is still in habitable repair. Over the door there is an inscription stating that it was built by Ky.sya Banu the daughter of Amir Timur Kurkhan, and of his wife Khyr Nissa. r l he caravanserai is still used as an outpost by a small party of Hazara horsemen stationed here, to bring news to Mohsinabad whenever J urkomans are expected. Piom tne top of the caravanserai I had a good view of the course of the Haii Bud. I be bed ot the Hori Rud is considerably more than halt a mile wide, and is full of trees and bushes. In the bed of the river a look-out post has been established by the Persi m horsemen generally kept here by Yusuf Khan to watch for Turkomans, hour stout poles have been driven into ground, and a platform erected on the top as a look- ait place for the sentry. A large portion of the bed of the river is swampy. I rode do an to the actual stream, which I found about 50 yards wide, running with a swift current, and at this season so deep that it was unfordable. 1 did not propose to cross ihe 8062 .

Both banks of the Hiri Rud northward ofMohsinabad are uninhabited to the junction oi the Kashuf Rud at Pnl-i-Khatnn, or the “lady’s bridge.” The country is fertile and formerly had a considerable population, but has heretofore been too much exposed to Turkoman incursions to be fit for habitation, except by Turkomans 1 he country on the east of the Hari Rud, belonging to Afghanistan, is also totally uninhabited until the Jamshedi camps, on the Kushk stream, are reached 1 rode down the course of the Hari Rud for some miles below Toman Aga. On the Afghan bank, about fi m i]es below Toman Aga, the fort of Bunyad Khan is seen, still apparently in fair preservation, though it has been deserted for many years. Bunyad Khan was formerly a powerful chief of the Hazara tribe. I should have liked very much to ride down the course of the Hari Rud. at least to Pul-i-Khatun, if not to Sarakhs, and Yusuf Khan was most willing to give me horsemen to enable me to do so, or to go across into Afghan territory, but I considered that there were objections to my doing so at this time. The course of the Hari Rud from Toman Aga to Pul-i-Khatun has never been traced by any European, and by not many Persians, as it has heretofore been too much infested by Turkomans for any one else to care to travel along it, though in ancient times there was a high road running down it. At the furthest point reached b y me I stood on a high bank and saw the river running northward for many miles. To the northward, about 25 miles distant, was a range of hills through which the river was said to force its way. Through my field glass I could at this point see a break in the line of hills. The hills on the Persian side were called Kuh Jami, and those on the Afghan side Kuh Siah Bubak. They extended on the Afghan side towards the Kushk river. I was informed that the Hari Rud forces its way through this range of hills by a very narrow pass, which is known as Tung-i-Daraya. The narrow portion extends, I was told, for about nine or ten miles, though the very narrowest part only extends for a short distance. There are some three places within the nine miles where the gorge narrows in this way. An army could not follow the bed of the Hari Rud from Toman Aga to Pul-i-Khatun, but when the river is not in flood small parties of hoi semen or footmen can travel this road, though it is a very bad one. Large bodies of horsemen go through a pass in Persian territory, several miles to the westward of the liver, or else through a pass several miles to the eastward through tiie Siah Bubak range of mountains, in Afghan territory. This latter road on the Afghan side of the river, is the best and favourite Turkoman raiding road from Pani Deh the head-quarters of the Saruk Turkomans, and is also the road by which Mr. Lessar, the Russian engineer, came down from Sarakhs toKhaf some three months a.tei ray visit to the Han Rud. Almost all caravanserais, or even fine reservoirs of water, besides their own names, are called after Abdulla Khan, the Bokhara chief who caused so many ot them to be built, and 1 believe Robat Abdulla Khan of Mr. Lessar so to be tin names, a Before I left Mohsinabad news Abdulla Khan of They ~-- 0 ~ tIlt . nan Rud.

Yusuf Khan draws an allowance from the Persian Government to enable him to keep up 190 horsemen for the Bakharz district, but he can really turn out, in case of a Tur koman raid, about 350 horsemen. He has also a right to call on the Timuri Chief of Khaf to support him with 200 horsemen in case of necessity, but, as the Timuri Chief of Khaf is not on friendly terms with him and his Hazaras, support would not be cordially given. The Bakharz district is a rich and fertile one, but very sparsely populated. The land revenue collected from it has heretofore been very small indeed, 1,500 tomans yearly (a toman is worth Is. 6c/.), having been the amount actually paid into the Shah’s treasury. A much larger sum is, however, collected from the people. Yusuf Khan Hazara has to pay very heavily in presents to the Governor General of Khurasan, and to the Mustashar-ul-Mulk, the Wuzier of Khurasan, whose rapacity is unbounded, and who is fast ruining the whole province. Peculation is, of course, common amongst Persian officials, but the cry against the Mustashar-ul-Mulk is universal. When I was in Khurasan before, he was sent to Tehran in disgrace, but, on presenting a bribe of large amount to the Shah, and promising that the revenue collected from the Khurasan province should be increased by 50,000 tomans yearly, he was reinstated in his post, returned in triumph to Mashad, and has since continued to oppress the people even more than before. About 56 years ago the then Governor of Bakharz, having quarrelled with the Persian Government, transferred himself and all his people to Herat. The popula tion of Bakharz, except the 500 families of Hazara, is entirely Tajik or Persian. These people were quite unwilling to proceed to Afghanistan, but' they were all driven out of their villages, and forcibly transferred by the then Governor. Since that time the population of Bakharz has been small, but the people have in a great measure returned to their native villages, a very large number having been permitted to return during the time the Hissam-i-Sultaneh was in possession of Herat. The numerous abandoned villages and kariz, or underground canals, show how much more populous this country formerly was than it now is. It is a fertile land, and could support a large population. It is the only part of Persia, except the country close to the Caspian, where the soil in the spring is covered in most parts with a fine green sward, though later in the year this withers away in Bakharz. It was delightful to the eye to see something green, after the barren desert of which Persia is chiefly composed. Soon after I left Mohsinabad, Yusuf Khan Hazara was deprived of the government of Bakharz, and replaced by a creature of the Mustashar-ul-Mulk, and Mohsinabad ceased to be the seat of government, the new Governor preferring to live at Shahr-i- Nao, where he was safer, and less exposed to Turkoman raids. The new settlement of the land revenue of Bakharz was commenced. It is very difficult indeed to discover what any district in Persia pays as land revenue, it being difficult to discover how much is paid as revenue to the Shah’s Government, and how much as presents and illegal cesses of various kinds. Dervish Aly Khan, the chief of Kbaf, assured me that in various forms he paid annually to the Governor General at Mashad 14,000 tomans for the Khaf district, and he was comparing his own heavy assessment with the light assessment of the neighbouring district of Bakharz. I was told that the real revenue due from Khaf was only 4,000 tomans ; but that, as all these Governorships are really put up to auction to the highest bidder, he was obliged to outbid all competitors by offering to pay 14,000 tomans a year. This is a very heavy assessment for a small and poor district like Khaf, which has very few villages, and is dependent for its revenue chiefly on the sheep grazed by the nomad Timuris, who form the chief part of its inhabitants. The population of Bakharz is more settled, the villages are much richer, and the water supply much greater, though the revenue paid was so little. It is this custom of selling the (governorship, especially of the border districts, to the highest bidder, w T hich is making the Persian rule in Khurasan hateful to the people. Everywhere it was said to me, “We do hope some one will come and deliver us from this oppression.” In some places I have heard even the Governor say, “ Ob, when “ shall we delivered from the hated Kajar ? we wish it w r as the English, but the “ Russians would be better than the Kajar.” The reigning family of Persia are Turks of the Kajar tribe. This feeling in favour of the English rather than the Russians is, however, confined to Khaf, Kaian, Birjand, and the district to the southward. In Bakharz, and certainly in all districts to the northward of that, the feeling is anti- English arid very pro-Russian. 1 feel certain that the Russians would only have to appear in almost any part of Khurasan to be welcomed with open arms as deliverers and liberators. I do not believe that even the small number of Persian troops thatu - ,iui-iui ^ ^iy m ^ wma j -i' ■3LTi=!l WU'IU JiiJlii- lll'UT'^ 20 Tr , i, , trnctpd to fight for the Shah, except the one or are stationed in Khurasan could usually form the garrison of Mashad, two regiments of Turks from Azarhaijan pla( f e&gt; The Turk regi- and the few hundred Turk artillerymen w o ^ P himself, and they rf* 0f L r S^«ft /Tu a ^lnc y in Pe. S ia as against Persian, look upon the dynasty as repieseming been alienated . Khurasan has always people from Khurasan try ‘o ea«jp«mto other ^ g f n f®;«own districts under eLwTas prisoner's? “while I wL in Khaf a large body of Arab nomads, who had gone C Kaian to settle on the rich unoccupied lands of Bakharz, were brought rac i under a stoin» escort °and were forcibly driven into the desert hills near Kanm, where there was no grazing for the flocks of sheep which accompanied them, and where, pro bably a largf proportion of them would die, while the lands o Bakharz remain unoccupied. The Amir of Kaian is a powerful noble, and will not let any one sir ,!&lt; ■ to him leave his districts. The people everywhere were saying, I he ^ hal “ sold us to the different Governors, and we are worse than slaves. On the one hand, every penny beyond the barest subsistence is screwed out of them and, on the other, they are not protected from Turkoman inroads, there is no law, and no justice can be obtained. It is not wonderful that the people long for a change, and looiv upon t m Russians as deliverers. It would only be exchanging one alien luie toi another, link rule for Russian. ^ , . . . . . . While I was in Mohsinabad, three Circassians (Daghistanis) passed through that place. They were very frightened of me, and could not he fully persuaded that I was not a Russian. I had some conversation with them, but they were too frightened to converse freely. They said they had been engaged in a rising in Daghistan eight years ago, and had been transported to Tomsk, in Siberia; that, 13 months previous to my meeting them, they had been released, and that they had ever since been on the road, begging their way from Tomsk, in Siberia, to their homes in the Caucasus. They said they had come by Almalyk (this is the place called Viernay by the Russians), then to Huzrut Sultan and Bokhara, thence to Maimana, and from Maimana to Herat. They were miserably poor, so I gave them a small sum of money to help them on their road home. The only possible difficulty that might arise if the Russians were to occupy the whole of Khurasan to-morrow would he about the town of Mashad. The shrine of Imam Reza, the eighth Imam in descent from Aly, is revered and loved by Persians in a way that we cannot understand. The Persian has no love of country, or patriotism, as we understand it at all. Persia is so broken up, and inhabited by races so different, and who have not at all amalgamated,—in the north chiefly Turks, in the centre tribes of Persian origin, Kurds, Lurs, &amp;c., speaking Persian dialects and often not even understanding one another, and in the south-east Arabs, all governed by a king who is alien in race to the majority. It is true a Persian will sometimes rave about Iran, hut when he does that he does not at all mean the Iran of the present, but some ideal Iran of the long past, when a Persian king, such as Anoshirwan, ruled, and when, he believes, justice was obtainable, and Persia a great kingdom, when the Shah- in-Shah was indeed a King of Kings, and his orders were obeyed from Egypt to the Indus. All love and reverence and patriotism, or what stands in its stead in a Persian’s mind, has been transferred to Aly and his descendants. The Persians have adopted Aly as their prophet, their hero, and, in many instances, as their God (I here refer to the sect of Aly lllahis, who believe Aly to have been God incarnate). The reverence for Hasan and Husain, the sons of Aly, and for their descendants down to the twelfth Imam, is something not to he understood by a European. Fanaticism could he strongly roused in Khurasan if it was thought that any insult was to he offered to the holy place around the tomb of Imam Reza at Mashad, hut if the Russians contented themselves with occupying the whole country, proclaiming that Mashad would be left alone, and would not he occupied by Russian troops, the whole province would welcome thtm as deliverers. Even Mashad itself could he occupied without danger if the priests m charge of the shrine were first won over, which could easily he done at the price &lt;d a little money and a few Russian decorations. In this matter, the vome of some five or six of the principal priests in Mashad would be all that it would he necessary to purchase, and the able Russian Consular Agent, Karim Beg, who residesat Mashad, would easily arrange the affair. Russia has in her Mussulman population of Kazan, Astrakan, and the Western Caspian seaboard, wonderfully good instruments for the furtherance of her policy in Central Asia. These men, Mussulman in religion, are by education and feelings thorough Russians ; they have been Europeanized without ceasing to be Muhammadans. We have nothing in India at all like these men, our very best and most advanced Native officials in India cannot be compared to them. Russia has followed an enlightened policy in trying to Russianize the peoples subjected by her, persuading the nobles to send their sons to be educated at the expense of the Government in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and giving commissions freely as captains and majors, even in the Imperial Guard, to the sons of Mussulman nobles. These men return to their own country after a few years at the Russian capital, where they have been treated with great respect, and have received decorations^ from the hands of the Emperor, full of pride in their new country and zeal for its service. They are allowed an unlimited furlough at their home, where they appear in the uniform of the Imperial Guard, and are proud of being Russians. I saw many instances of this. When travelling from Baku to Tiflis, in the train with me was a man in the uniform of a Captain of the Imperial Guard ; he was introduced to me by Colonel VassilchikofF, of the Cossack regiment of Taman (who travelled with me from Krasnovodsk to Tiflis, having, taken a fortnight’s leave from Askabad), as a Persian Prince. This Persian Prince took off his hat when introduced to me exactly in the European style, and behaved altogether so that I should not have discovered that he was an Asiatic but for the purity of the Persian which he spoke to me. He told me that he had been to Tehran to visit his great uncle the Shah, who had offered him a General’s commission in the Persian service with a pay of fifteen thousand roubles a year, but that he pre ferred a captain’s commission in the Russian Imperial Guard on fifteen hundred roubles a year. He was then proceeding to Tiflis on some duty in waiting on the Governor General of the Caucasus. I was so glad to see when I arrived in London that some Native officers of the Indian Army had been brought home after the Egyptian campaign, and treated with honour while in this country, and I feel certain this will have a good effect, but I am sorry they were not kept very much longer in England. It would be a very great thing for the Native officers of the Indian Army if a few of the younger men could be brought to England and attached to one of the military schools for a year or two to complete their education. Of course, at first they would not be able to compete with young Englishmen in education, and there would have to be separate classes for them; but nothing, I think, could be done that would so much tend to render these men loyal. Of the two Native officers of the 11th Bengal Lancers, who were brought home by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and were attached to his staff for some time, one has already been given the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and has been appointed our Resident at Kabul/ Besides bringing over a few' of the best educated young Native officers to complete their education at a military college in England, I would, as a reward, every year allow' a certain number of older ones who had performed distinguished service a free passage to England and back, and a small sum ot money to meet their expenses in this country. Russia pursues an enlightened policy with reference to the treatment of her Native officers. She gives them real commissions, which carry bond fide rank with them. In India the Subadar-Major, the highest rank to which a Native officer can usually attain, is commanded by the last joined English Ensign. It will be said that the natives ot India are not fit to be entrusted with command, but I am certain that there are numbers of Native officers who would do well in any r position, and my idea is that com missions should be freely given to the natives of India up to the rank of Major. We are the only nation which makes colour a bar to rising in its military service. In Algeria the French gave commissions freely to Arab officers to the rank of Captain, and a few even higher, and the commission is a bond fide one, an Arab Captain commanding all French subalterns. I quite allow that, in the piesent state of affairs in India, it might not be advisable to give the permanent command of regi ments to natives of that country, but I see no reason why they should not hold appointments junior to Commandant. The Russians go very much further than this; they not only give commissions to Asiatics in corps composed of Asiatics, but sometimes in regiments of what we should call Europeans. I firmly believe that there are Native officers of the Indian Army who would worthily fill much higher posts than they r are now permitted to hold. Subadar-Major Aziz Khan, of the 5th Punjab Infantry, who was killed while serving under General Sir F. Roberts at the Peiwar Kotal, during the last Afghan war, was an instance of a Native officer who might have 8062 . Fymsammmmm 22 Wn trusted with much more important duties than those he was permitted to per- been tiustea wiui () f intelicence, brave even to rashness, who had twice won ^defoTlri wEl^tats for Indian soldiers in place of the Victoria Cross who had shown his faithfulness to the English Government during the trying times of the mutiny and who was a fine looking specimen of the Afghan race he was wor by of something better than the position of Subadar-Major beyond which he was not allowed bv the rules of our service to advance. His commanding officer, in writing of him, said, ,, I f eel ae though I have lost my right hand.” Such men in the Russian service would I mentioned, in several ot my reports, inai a iu.ge uvu, u* . tribe had left the Tekeh country and entered Persia, and had been settled at Zurabad and near the Kashuf Hud. Zurabad is situated a few miles from the Hari Rud, north of Turbat Shaik Jam. In 1832, after the capture of the old town of Sarakhs by Abbas JVlirza, a portion of the Salor Turkomans, to whom that town belonged, i ’ rr ,.4,iv t i tlvo T’rvL'nh Tnrbnmnns in thp Mcrv nrmntrv were settled became powerful, they ucuame puwc.xui, found these Salors settled in Persia a thorn in their side, and during the period of the great Persian famine, about ten years ago, the whole of the Salor Turkomans settled at Zurabad and in its neighbourhood were, partly by force and partly by persuasion, moved off and settled in the Merv country, along the Murghab river. The tribe was broken up and divided among the different sections of the Merv Tekeh. They do not appear to have found their position amongst the Tekeh as a subordinate tribe a very pleasant one, and in 1881, abuut 1,500 families of them came back to Persia, and the majority of them have settled near Zurabad. Some have settled at Ak Darbund, on the Kashuf Rud, and some within 13 miles of Turbat Shaik Jam, at a place called Nilabad. A fine fort is being built at Zurabad by the Persians. Two companies of the Karai regiment, and two guns, with a few artillerymen, are stationed at Zurabad to keep the Salor Turko mans in order. A large sum of money has been granted by the Persian Government for the construction ot this fort, and it is being built with some amount of vigour, but the peculation which goes on in a matter of this sort is terrible. I would give as an instance the fort at Mozdaran, on the road between Mashad and Sarakhs, which was charged to the Persian Government as having cost 17,000 tomans, while I hear on good authority that the sum actually expended on the fort w^as only 800 tomans. I hear that the Salor Turkomans who have settled in Persian territory are not very contented, ^ 1 he Persian Government, with its unpaid officials, who must extort money to live, is very unfit to carry out a scheme of colonization in the fruitful but hitherto almost uninhabited country near the Hari Rud. Besides these Turkomans settled in the neighbourhood of Zurabad, two deserted villages in the Pusht-kKuh i Jam plateau, cue named Khargish and the other Kummar Zird, are being reueonled’ W . lt 7 ifT nllU r S j°( t , he , sectlon of wllul1 Sart ’P Aly Murdan Khan is chief.

I am, of course, too far away from Kabul to obtain reliable information on this point, but the feeling in this pait ot the world is strong that the Amir is much more favourably inclined towards Russia than towards Eng and. Russia panders to the desire that all Orientals have for decorations and orders, while in all Persia and in Herat there is not cne single official who wears an English order, the only one, the Sipah Salar, who was G.C.S.I., having died. It is true there are two English employes, one at Mashad and the other at Shiraz, who have a C.I.E., but neither of these men is Persian or in Persian employment. Sardar Ishak Khan, the Governor of Afghan Turkistan when 1 first arrived on this frontier, had with him a Russian agent, but I do not know if he is still with him. Sardar Ayub Khan, after various delays, left Mashad for Tehran early in March accompanied by a moderate following of his most devoted partisans, the great body having dropped off during the months he waited at various points on the Persian frontier A large number of the principal Sardars refused to accompany him Sardar Hashim Khan, with his three brothers and the wife of Amir Sher Aly Khan, remained at Mashad, and did not accompany him. Sardar Hashim Khan was at first at Turbat Hidari, but proceeded to Mashad on the recommendation of the British Agent, Mirza Abbas Khan, C.I.E. The young son of Amir Sher Aly Khan named Abdur Rahman Jan, a boy of thirteen, also remained at Mashad Sardar Hasan Khan and Sartip Nur Muhammad Khan went off to Sistan, with a large following of women and children. Sardar Ahmad Aly Khan, the grandson of Amir Shir Aly Khan, also left, and the people who accompanied Ayub Khan were chiefly personal followers, whose fortunes were bound up with his. * . J I returned from Mohsinabad to Khaf by a different road from that by which I came passing by Mashad Reza, and halting the night at a small village named Khajeh. The next morning I crossed the Bakharz range of hills by a difficult pass, and reached Khaf. x he distance by this road is about the same as by that by which I went to Mohsinabad via Karat; the distance in the one case is forty-eight miles, and in the other about forty-six. f he road by Karat is far the easiest, being passable for guns. Chapter IV. Journey from Rui Khaf to Birjayid. The relief caused to this border by the departure of Ayub Khan from Mashad is very great, and in Herat is greater still. Every one in that town was living in a state of tension, not knowing how long the party of the Amir would be triumphant and all expecting some attempt by Ayub Khan for the recovery of the place. His partisans collected arms and gunpowder secretly in the villages near the town, and everybody was kept on the qui vive. This was especially the case when he was so near Herat as Khaf. But as the months passed on, the hopes of his followers and of his partisans in Herat fell, and his removal from Mashad to Tehran finally extinguished all hope. Affairs at Herat then settled down, and that town enjoyed a period of quiet and good rule, to which it had long been a stranger. Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan made a very good governor, and ruled with justice and moderation. Unfortunately, the Amir interfered with this state of things. He sent a man called Feramorz Khan to be Sipah Salar, or Commander-in-Chief, at Herat. Feramorz Khan was a man of no influence, having originally been a slave. He was much trusted by the Amir, and from the moment he arrived, he commenced to intrigue against Abdul Kudus Khan. He sent unfavourable reports to the Amir concerning Abdul Kudus Khan, and gradually all power was taken from him. The charge of the border districts, namely Kusan, Ghurian, Isfazar and Obeh, with the command of the tribal horse, was given by the Amir to Nail) Sultan Khan Afshar. The customs and revenue were made over to Ahmad Aly Khan, a eonfiden'ial servant of the Amir, who had also charge of the gates of the town. The command of the regular troops was held by Feramorz Khan Sipah Salar. The only thing that remained to Abdul Kudus Khan, who still had the title of Governor, was the administration of justice. Even in this he was impeded by Feramorz Khan. Before the arrival of that person, very severe discipline had been maintained, and the Afghan troops had not been allowed to plunder or ill-use ihe people of Herat, but as soon as the power had been taken out of the hands of Abdul Kudus, the soldiers gave way to the most unbridled license, insulth g women, plundering the orchards of all fruit, cutting down fruit trees for firewood, and oppressing the people in every way, and Feramorz Khan would not allow Abdul Kudus Khan to punish his soldiers for these breaches of discipline, nor w ould he punish them himself. The people said thatCT j jrH ^l4U4^,^;iUUUMM^ 24 1 • XT . f o« thpv had been in the worst times under Ayub Khan, things were as had m Heia -ipserved something better than this from the Amir, Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan had des_^ hand | il oftroopS; an d for whose party, for whom he had captured Herat he had made many friends by his wisdom which was not originaUy popular in he had l)een slander ed to the Amir hy Na1b S Sultfn Khan and Sipah Salar ^eramorz Kham plaoe which I had been On the l^hApri B a^d from Khaf the extreme frontier, desired to visit.

The architect and superintendent the inscription says, was Muhammad Khafi, and I certainly approve of Muhammad Kbah s taste. 1 he inside is said to he exactly similar to the mosque of Gour Shahd, the wife of Ann Timur which is at Mashad'in the enclosure of the tomb of Imam Reza, which is con sidered bv Shiah Muhammadans as one of the most beautiful bmidirigs in the world. After leaving this village the road continues over the plain. The low hills on the right of the road are the same low range which rise just behind Khaf, and are called Kuh Khoja Yar; and the higher range, called Kuh Kalata, which is some 10 miles from Khaf, and runs parallel to the Khoja Yar range, comes to an end a few miles farther on, near the village of Mehrabad. The village of Nushtyfan, celebrated lor its tobacco, is seen some distance to the right ot the road. About one miJe before Sangun is reached, the village ol Bahrabad is passed, ihe tobacco cultivation of this place is surrounded hy a belt of Scotch firs. Scotch fir trees, and, in fact all sorts of fir or pine, are very rare in Persia, but at Rui-Khaf and several places near it they grow well’ and are plentiful. Sangun is a large village, protected by a strong fort with high walls, far stronger than is usual in Persia. It would he difficult to take without artillery. As the chief man of the place remarked, “We being so near the “ border, what with raids by Turkomans and raids hy Afghans, must have a strong “ place if we hope to live at all.” The chief was a cousin of Dervish Aly Khan, the Timuri chief, and though orders had been sent to him to treat me with all civility, he never came to see me or sent to inquire after my health, as is customary in Persia. The people also were not inclined to be civil. The road from Khaf via Sangun to Ghurian and Herat is the one most commonly used by caravans, as it is not quite so much exposed to Turkoman incursions as the road a little to the north, by Karat and Ghurian. The road by Sangun is longer, but is, I understand, the one that would be preferred by an army. I here give the two routes:— Sangun Kal Gao Kuki Rui-Khaf to Ghurian, via Sangun. - 11 miles. Pass the villages of Kharjird, Mehrabad, and Nushtyfan, the last some distance to the right of the road, and Bahrabad. Sangun is a large village, with a good deal of cultivation. It is very ruinous, but sup plies in considerable quantities can be pro cured. It has a strong fort, and is governed hy a cousin ot the l imuri Chief who governs Khaf. “ 15 » Road good over a plain.

Th is pass is called Dahna Shishab, Dahna being the word used in this part of the world for pass. The road then goes over broken country for 11 miles, when the fort of Karat, with a curious minar, or pillar, outside it, is reached. Provisions in small quantities, 20 houses in fort. Road from Khaf passable, with a little work, to guns. Road leads over plain until, at 20 miles, a number of ruined kariz, or abandoned canals, are reached. Water is obtainable from kariz, and caravans sometimes halt here, but as it is very much infested by Turkomans, they generally press on and reach the first in habited place. Road over plain, a spring of brackish water. A kariz containing water in spring. On a hill above the road is a large stone, about six feet in height, placed on end on the top of the hill. Tradition says it was so placed by a young woman, hence the name “ the Virgin’s Stone.” Ruins of a caravanserai, road passing over low hills. The first inhabited village in Afghan territory. Road over a plain to Ghurian. Afghan fort and group of villages. 77 miles. Sangun is of importance, being a resting place for caravans after they have crossed the strip of nearly 80 miles of uninhabited country which intervenes between it and Ghurian. On the 14th April I marched from Sangun to Muznabad, distant 17 miles. On the road the village of Niazabad is seen, distant about one and a half miles to the left. This village gives its name to a large salt swamp or kavir, which extends for a long distance in the direction of Sabzawar. It is said to be about 10 miles wide, and of considerable length, hut I could not find out how long. Herat and Ghurian, and all that part of the country, is supplied with salt from this kavir. At 12 miles I passed the village of Behdadun, just before reaching which village I crossed the bed of the stream on which Rui Khaf is built. It is generally dry except 8062. G26 after rain; it rises near Khaf, passes by Nushtyfan, and falls into the large kavir which is situated^some 10 miles beyond Nmza a cr08se d, the water of which is in- A few ™'*ee ey r,idt,t d R n ud an andd r ah,s a considerable extent of country. I also te ' lse &gt;, f m another lourney a few miles north of Kaian, it also falls into the depression erossed t on another JO ]L za bad and Ghurian, in fact, it is the cause of this con- above allude o, * hours previous to my crossing, had been in Jm IM . 431 * of *m fee of water but when I crossed the stream it was only about 18 inches deep. TMs salt river seems to be the most important river of all this part of the country and the whole drainage of the country south of the Bakharz range, and north of Kaian runs into the above-mentioned depression. At Behdadun a great panic was caused by our appearance, the people seized their arms and manned the walls, and the villagers 'in the fields stopped work and ran to the village. We were supposed to be Turkomans, who are very much given to harrying these villages; in fact, about a month after I had passed the villages in this neighbourhood were visited by a Turko- man band and several of the inhabitants carried off, as well as some camtls. At 15 m ii es from Sangun the village of Karian was passed on the right of the road, then Husainabad, and then Muznabad was reached. The headman was most civil,^ bringing provisions and refusing payment, but, upon leaving, he accepted a present in money of greater value than the things supplied. He declared that Muznabad was formerly a large town, built by the daughter of King Afrasiab, the enemy of the national hero, Rustam. Some ruins were visible, but not of any great extent or importance. A very intelligent young man, a brother of the headman, had been carried off by the Turkomans, and been a slave in the Merv country for nine years; I talked with him a good deal. He was much astonished at my intimate knowledge of people and things in that part of the world, and could hardly believe that I could know so much, not only about the country, but about the individual chiefs, without having visited it. 1 generally found it very little use speaking to returned Persian slaves, they know so very little about the country. They only know the camp in which they were slaves. Of course with Turkomans the case is very different, and the constant communication I had with Turkomans of all classes while in Daragez and Mashad enabled me to pick up good information. Muznabad is the last village in the Khaf district. The country beyond is uninhabited for a distance of 22 miles, when the Kaian district is reached. The road here leads over a sandy waste, and after some miles sand hills are actually^ crossed, but they are not very difficult ones. At this season the whole country was green and pleasant to the eye, the snow of winter and the heavy rain we have had this year having covered the sand with a fine coating of grass, and even some flowers. I can, however, understand that, towards the end of summer, this piece of country between Muznabad and the village of Bohnabad, which is the first village in the Kaian district, would appear very desolate, though there is no kavir or salt desert. About a mile before reaching Bohnabad the country becomes very stony, and so continues until the village of Fundukht is reached, about one and a half miles further The distance from Muznabad to Fundukht is 24 miles. Ihese villages of Bohnabad and Fundukht are situated in the tract of country buh-i-Kaian. They are at the foot of an extensive range of mountains cal ed Kuh Kwaja bhahz. The highest peak of these mountains is just above the village ot l uiHlukht, and must be at least eight or nine thousand feet high. Though the weather on the plain is very hot, there is snow on this mountain. I am told that’there is a small p ateau on the top, with two springs of water and two shrines the one called Kwaja &gt; hahz and the other Sultan Sulyman, after a son of Imam Reza. There ' a line of villaues - -J\ the foot of thls range, supplied with water for cultivation bv on a 11 streams which pour down from the hills, but the country is a poor one ^r Fundukht another range of hills is in sight called Kuh Kyber ^ This rans-e of nimm lepressnons known in , his part of the world as d“ w P lake i forn.ed r, Tn n ! Water coll ‘ ;cts . and for lake is termed, which dries up n tlm . is some om dak, m which,« months in the year a some Arab mats or Persian ibex up m the summer nomads were encamped. In the afternoon Near Persian ibex, aat had been shot in H o &lt;nteinoon a specimen oi They are hete called tekeh or &lt;&lt;&lt; r ® urm £ mountains, was brought to idea that the . larkhor t^L m f S - te &gt; eh , mar .khor. This has given rise to larkhor (c apm „ le(/uceros) hfound in ^inquiry, I feel certain that the markhor is found nowhere in Persia, though tekeh markhor is sometimes used for a fine specimen of the Persian ibex. At Karat the people had seen the horns of a true markhor which had been brought from Afghan istan. A curious concretion is found in the stomach of the Persian ibex, of the wonderful properties of which the people have the most fabulous ideas. They call it Pa-zahr. It is believed to be an antidote to all poison, more especially to snake poisons. To poisonous substances taken internally it is also supposed to be an antidote, being taken rubbed down and mixed with a little milk. The stone itself is applied outwardly to snake bites and stings of scorpions, it is also believed that a childless woman will soon be blessed with a child if she swallows a small quantity of this precious stone. It is the stone known in medieval Europe as the Bezoar stone, and the Persian ibex is called the Bezoar goat. The concretion is, I believe, only found in old animals, and is caused by some disease. The sportsman who brought me the young wild goat told me they had often found these concretions in ibex which they had killed. At Birjand I procured a fine specimen of the stone. These Bezoar stones are sometimes worn as amulets or charms hung around the neck by women in Persia. I was sorry not to ascend the Kwaja Shahz mountain so as to take its height. It must be lofty, as it is a remarkable object from Khaf, which is more than 50 miles off. On the 17th April I marched 19 miles to Bamrud. The road for the first three miles skirts the Kwaja Shahz range of mountains, and is very stony indeed. It then passes near the small village of Mehrabad. At four and a half miles the village of Isfad is reached. From Isfad the road leaves the neighbourhood of the hills and passes over a sandy plain for 14 miles. At three miles from Isfad the village of Abiz is seen some two miles to the right of the road, close to the mountains. At four miles from Isfad a garden with a tank of water, known as Khur-i-Sarhang, is passed. At 19 miles from Fundukht Bamrud is reached. Bamrud is a fortified village of con siderable size, and contains probably about 400 inhabitants. Outside the fort there is a lofty mosque, partly in ruins. There is a small canal of water which is brought from the neighbouring mountains, and which never dries up. The water is slightly brackish. On the 18th, I marched seven miles to Charaks, the last village on the road between Kaian and Ghurian. It is a large village, and contains probably 700 inhabitants. A good many caravans pass through this place on their way from Ghurian to Birjand. Charaks is celebrated for its good tobacco, but it has not a great deal of cultivation. Grain is brought from Ghurian, and from the villages in the district known as Zir Kuh or cc under the hills.” The distance from Charaks to Ghurian is about 77 miles, and the route followed by caravans is as follows :— Gul Haoz Charaks to 15 miles. Ghurian. No inhabitants. A well and a haoz or Shukur Chasm a - 15 „ reservoir. No inhabitants. A spring of water. Robat-i-Shah Baluch - 8 „ No inhabitants. Four wells of brackish Haoz-i-Bandan - 23 „ water. A haoz, which is sometimes dry in summer. Ghurian - - 16 „ Total - - 77 miles. On the 19th April I marched from Charaks, 35 miles, to the fort of Yazdun. The road for the first 18 miles was over a plain, with good grazing for camels and sheep. At the end &lt;&gt;f 18 miles a piece of salt desert is reached. It is about four miles wide, and probably 15 or 16 long. It can be seen extending to nearly the foot of the Ahinguran range of mountains. After crossing the salt desert, a piece of firm ground is reached, a id on the edge of this there is a spring of very slightly brackish water. This sprim: is called Petirgun. About half a mile from the spring a curious depres sion or hoi ow in the country is reached. It would in any land less arid and desert than Persia, he the bod of a large lake, and even here it attempts to be a lake. These depnssions, vvhii h receive the drainage of a considerable tract of country, and are alternate ly lakes and salt swamps, are known in this part of the country as daks. This one is ea lied Dak-i-Khurshab by people at a distance, though the inhabitants of the neighbourhood call it simply Dak, as we would say, “the lake. Ihis is not the11 28 This dak is about about at this . u &gt; mnrh the most extensive one.

As I knew the people would be alarmed in this lonely spot by the approach of horsemen, I sent on two horsemen to give notice of my approach. Yazdun, though a small fort, has high walls, and would be difficult to take without artillery. The door, as in all forts of the better class in Persia, is a large millstone, which is placed on end and serves as a door. When it is required to open it, the millstone is rolled back into a cavity of the wall. There is always a wooden door besides, but generally of a very poor description. Yazdun is decidedly ancient. It is of a different pattern from most Persian forts, and has a central keep, which is not usual. The walls are in rather bad repair, and as the water supply is from a kariz situated outside the fort the water could be cut off. It is very praiseworthy of the Amir of Kaian to garrison and keep up this outpost. I am told he not only gets nothing from it, but it actually costs him money to keep it up. About 25 years ago he, found that a party of Afghan robbers had settled in the neighbourhood, and were raiding and plundering. As the place undoubtedly belongs to Persia, and is several miles within the Persian frontier, he repaired the old fort which was already here, and placed a garrison of 30 soldiers in it, under rather a fine fellow as Naib or Li eutenant. He also brought 14 families of cultivators. The place now has 96 inhabitants, including children. Several of the cultivators live at a place four miles oft, called Kabuda, where there are two towers and some cultivation. Yazdun is very much exposed to attacks by robber bands. Six or seven years ago it was attacked by a hand of Baluchis, who were only driven off after a sharp fight, and the Naib told me and committed depredations. A large body of Afghan nomads are settled at the spring of water known as Peshinjan, where there is a tower for defence about 30 miles on tne first permanent Afghan village, called Abkal, is situated, from which it is 12 miles to babzawar making the whole distance from Yazdun to Sahzavvar m Afghanistan S...

Though nmtters are far better than they were, within the nme months prevmus to my visit Turkomans had twice raided in the neighbourhood of Yazdun. On the fust occasion they killed an Afghan from a caravan on its way from Herat to Birjand, and thf 1 second time they carried off a man from Kabuda. aria After a short time the Naib returned. He was a most intelligent man, and I had a good deal of conversation with him. He complained of the terrib y dull life he led in this out of the way little fort, and said he never could stir out unless well armed and mounted He said he sometimes went to Sabzawar, but not often, as he seems to have had a feud with the Afghan nomads encamped at Peshinjan, about 30 miles on the road to Sabzawar. The Amir of Kaian claims as Persian territory up to a ruined village called Nuzzur Babi, 19 miles from Yazdun, but really the country between Yazdun and Peshinjan is neutral territory, and it would be very difficult to say to whom it belongs. Constant difficulties and quarrels arise in consequence of the frontier not being clearly defined. The Afghans have no right, I believe, to anything beyond Peshinjan. . , . On the 20th April I returned to Charaks. The water in the salt swamp or lake had risen very much since the previous day, and was rising fast. I saw the tracks that we had made in our struggles through the mud immersed in the clear water, and we had to make a detour a little to the northward to avoid the rising flood. There had been rain in the hills, and all the streams which fall into the dak were pouring a considerable body of water into it from the Kuh Ahinguran. After crossing the lake we went rapidly back to Charaks. In the low range of hills to the north of the lake, called Kuh Humayun, I was told that a copper mine was formerly worked, but was now abandoned, and that only two men in Charaks knew the exact spot where it was situated. The Government are so shortsighted that they discourage the working of all mines. The people of Charaks are terribly crowded in their fort, but are too much afraid of Turkomans to build in the cultivation outside, though a few ruins show that formerly the inhabitants had not been confined to the fort. From Charaks there are three roads to Birjand, the nearest is by Bamrud, whence I came, and then through the Meruk pass and by Duruksh to Sar-i-Cha and Birjand, but I preferred to go by the Ahinguran pass, which, though longer and through a less cultivated country, is said to be the easiest pass, and I wanted to explore this road. It would have been far easier for me to have gone direct from Yazdun to Gazik, but as Sir Charles Macgregor had travelled by that road, I wanted to try one of the unexplored roads through the Ahinguran range of mountains. I left Charaks on the 22nd April, and marched to a village called Disg, distant 22 miles. The road led for about 11 miles over a plain, when some steep sand hills were crossed. Beyond the sand hills was the Ahinguran range of mountains which is the same range as that known farther north as Kwaja Shahz, from one of its nghest peaks which bears that name. At the foot of the range, about 13 miles mi es from Charaks, stands the small village of Ahinguran, which gives its name to this part of the range. Soon after leaving the village of Ahinguran a pass in thf* “Innh Tw 18 e ' tere '|- th 0 roa&lt; l 'P the pass the ruins of a fine stone fort are died, known as kala Dokhtur. At 22 miles from our starting point the villaire of D,sg ,s reached. It is a poor little place. On the road abandoned furr acd fof th! smelting of ,ron ore were seen, and the hills were very rich in iron h&lt;5 no Ji mger smelted, it being found cheaper to import Enirlish ore is . but the or Russian iron from the Casnian ''ThWnVi7iw ir0l \ { ^ Bandar Abbas, •nerly smelted the iron ore here. From Di^a ^sthe hills and joinsthe road by the Meruk pass, which is a bad one, but shorter than that by which I was travelling. I marched the next day to Nakab, a village distant 22 miles. At one mile from Disg a small hamlet called Gomeh is passed, but it contained no inhabitants at this season. At 12 miles a small hamlet, Badamistan, where some nomads were encamped. At 18^ miles I reached a spring of good water called Cha Mulla, and at 22 miles the village of Nakab. Although crops were growing in the fields, we found the place entirely deserted by its inhabitants, except by one aged couple, who professed entire ignorance on every subject under the sun. I left the road and went to another small village, Dareh Charm, which we found also deserted by its inhabitants, except by three or four women. Out in the fields we saw a boy working, and managed to capture him. He was a young Arab, but could speak bad Persian, and, being presented with a piece of money, showed us the way to the village of Khulf, where there were a few inhabitants. Amongst them was a very civil Turkoman merchant from the Merv country, who, as soon as I arrived, called upon me and offered to get me supplies, &amp;c. He was here collecting an odoriferous gum which is exported to Bokhara. This gum is used in dyeing, in the Bokhara country. When a pattern is to be left white on a coloured ground, the portion which is to remain white is covered with this gum before the article is placed in the dye- tub. It is very cheap in this part of the world, three and a half pounds of it being sold for about 8^., while it is worth 8d. or 9d. a pound in Bokhara. It is, I believe, the product of the wild pistachio tree, which is common in this neighbour hood. It is also chewed by women, and is said to be good for the teeth. I wondered whether it could be the substance sold in Europe under the name of oppo- ponax. I halted the next day at this place, though I had a good deal of difficulty in getting supplies even for my small party. The inhabitants of all the villages in the neighbourhood are Arabs. They are nomads, inhabiting black goats’ hair tents, and only occupy the villages in winter. In summer they wander about with their herds. They all speak Arabic amongst themselves, but could speak Persian badly. They said there were still about 1,500 tents or families who spoke Arabic, but that part of their tribe had given up Arabic and become Persianized. They claim the Amir of Kaian as an Arab, and I believe he really is of Arab descent. These people said they had been brought from Arabia very many generations ago ; they did not know by whom or when. They differed in no respect from the Bedouin I had met in Northern Syria and Turkish Arabia, except, I think, that they were taller and heavier men than the Arabs usually are. Their manner was very different from that of Persians; they were much more free and independent, though perfectly civil. On the 24th April I went back to Nakab to get on to the road to Birjand, as I wanted to follow the regular road from the Ahinguran pass to that place, but it would have been easier for me to have crossed over to Duruksh and to have got into the road which goes from the Meruk pass. Duruksh is famous for its carpets, which are the best of those made in this part of the world. From Nakab the road went over a plain for 7^ miles, when the bed of a considerable river, the Fuk Hud, was crossed. It, however, at this season contained no water. At 11 miles the large village of Gask was entered. Here also very good carpets were made, and a number were brought to me for sale, but I did not purchase any, as the carpets ma le in the Birjand district have acquired a very bad name, in consequence of the people using aniline dyes, and mixing cotton with the wool of which the carpets arc manufactured. The whole road this day was at a very high level, varying from 5,400 to 6,800 feet, even the plain being at an elevation of nearly 5,000 feet. At 20 miles from our starting point the village of Sar-i-Cha was reached. This village has a strong fort, which stands at an elevation of 6,700 feet above the sea. The country passed over is very barren and poor, and the people could not support themselves by agriculture; but Sar-i-Cha is celebrated all over Persia for two articles manufactured here. One is a cloth woven of kurk, or the inner wool of the goat. The long coarse hair of the goats is cut off, and the soft inner wool combed out with an iron comb. A very fine and soft material is obtained from this wool. The other article for which Sar-i-Cha is celebrated is coloured socks, both of cotton and wool, which are here largely manufactured. Every man, woman, and child in the place is perpetually employed, even when walking about, in knitting these socks, which are of very brilliant patterns. Most of the inhabitants belong to the new sect called Babis. They are followers of Aly Muhammad, of Shiraz, commonly called A1 Bab. This sect is widely spread in Persia, and has given a great deal of trouble to the Government, by whom it is terribly persecuted. A1 Bab, who was born in 1824, after living some32 „ m. »dK.*,h ■ ? » T iy, M ;; M ‘”,i l r He preached a purified species of occasionally, God sent a special portion of from God and would return ^ G°d t ha t, occasio ^ whpn it h J done its work) his spirit into souie partic was ’ the one „ P h ; ch was in Abraham, Moses, our returned to him ; that , thls .

Though A1 Bab himself was 1843 to 184/ were preauneu ' Hoetrines very widely. His best known put in pnson. he was a e P B h u h n(1 Muhammad Aly, called Barfrushi, disciples were Molla Husa ’ un „ woman known as Kurut-ul-Ayn, from ‘VfMolhrfKalvin This young womaf, who threw aside her veil, and preached in inihlic l mveiled, especially holding forth against the evds of polygamy brought many converts to the cause. Al Bab himself was a man of peace, and wished to a«ai.i his ends by peaceable means. He did not countenance the violent acts of his followers In 1849 and 1850 there were revolts of the Bains in several paits of ; . Monr Husain and Muhammad Aly Barfrushi raised the standard of revolt in Mazandaran and they were not captured and killed without considerable loss to the troops of the Government. Their stronghold at Shaik Tabarsy was only captured after ^MoilfMuhammad Aly Zenjani, so called after the town of Zenjan which is on the road between Tabriz and Tehran., who was also a great disciple of Al Bab raised che standard of revolt, and fighting went on in Zenjan for eight or nine months before the Babis were suppressed. Al Bab was himself put to death at Tabriz, though it was not at all proved that he was in any way implicated in the revolts. A curious circumstance attended his execution. He and one disciple were fastened by ropes and placed before a company of soldiers for execution. The disciple, when the soldiers had fired and the smoke cleared away, was found to he dead, but Al Bab was gone. 1 ne bullets had cut the ropes, and he had escaped. He did not, however, escape for long; be was found hidden in a guard house, and as the soldiers believed him to be bullet proof, and would very probably have refused to fire at him again, he was hacked to pieces by an officer with his sword. Some years later an attack was made on Nasr-ud-Din Shah by some Bahis. After this Babism was put down with a high hand. All known Bahis who could be found were put to death with the most horrible tortures. The young woman, Kurut-ul-Ayn, was burned alive, and though she was offered her life, on condition that she denied the tenets of Al Bah, she refused. The most revolting cruelty was exercised towards the Babis, but the sect has by no means died out, and even now has probably a hundred thousand followers in Persia. They are found everywhere, but are less numerous in Khurasan than elsewhere. Next day I left Sar-i-Cha, and marched by a road which ascends and descends a great deal to the village of Marak. At miles the small village of Rahnish is passed, and at eight miles, Dastgird. After leaving Dastgird the road went over a steep hill, and ai 11 miles the poor little village of Marak was reached. There is a direct road from Dastgird into Birjand, hut I preferred to halt at Marak, as it was necessary for me to send notice to the Amir of Kaian of my expected arrival in Birjand. I sent on my mirza and one servant with a letter of introduction from Yah)a Khan, one of the ministers in Tehran. - On tlie 26th April, 1 marched across the plain to Birjand, and at 11 miles reached that town. A comfortable house was given me to lodge in, and within a few minutes of my arrival the Amir’s two sons called upon me, and everything was done to make my stay in the place as pleasant as possible. All this part of the world is subject to Mir Alam Khan, Amir of Kaian. He has the title of Hashmut-ul-Mulk from the Shah, and holds the honorary rank in the Persian army of Amir-i-Toman, or Major- General. His overnment comists of nine and a half baluks, or counties, the most northern of these being called Zir Kuh. His Government includes the whole country from the immediate neighbourhood of Khaf to the desert, south of Sistan. On the east Ins territory is bounded by Afghanistan. It is about 300 miles in length, by about 150 in width in the noithein part, but gradually narrowing towards the south. He is of Arab descent, like a large number of the population of the Kaian district. Formeilv the seat of Government was at Kaian, and the Amirs of Kaian after the death of Nadir Shah, were semi-independent chiefs, though always owW allegiance to th • Persian Gover mei.t; hut since 1832, when AhbSs Mirza o ra nd- father of the p esent Shah, reduced all Khurasan to thorough obedience the Amirs ofKaian, like the chiefs of Tahhas, Bujnurd, Kuchan, Daragez, and Khaf, have sunk to the position of provincial Persian Governors, taking their orders from the Governor General of Khurasan, and being removed at the pleasure of the Shah, though a member of the same family is always appointed to the governorship of these places. The districts under the Government of Mir Alam Khan furnish two regiments of infantry, of the nominal strength of 800 men each, and a regiment of cavalry, of 250 horsemen. The infantry regiments are not at their full strength, but in case of war could easily be recruited up to it. The cavalry is actually kept up to a greater strength than that for which the Shah pays. Though pay is only drawn for 250 horse men, 400 are really kept up. There are 40 artillermen, and five serviceable guns. The artillerymen are sent from Tehran, and are Turks from Azarbaijan. The Amir has a number of guns, some at Nasrabad, the capital of Sistan, and some at Birjand, but at the most no more than five are serviceable, and even of these the carriages are very rotten. Besides these troops, a certain number of men would be furnished by the nomad tribes of the district. The Iljari system, which has been done away with in other parts of Khurasan, is still kept up by the Amir of Kaian. Each nomad tribe under his rule is bound when called upon to furnish one man in four, properly armed, as a sort of militia. These men while so employed receive no pay, and food only to the amount of half a kaian mun, equal to one and three-quarter pounds of wheat a day, while absent from their homes. A considerable number of these Iljari troops are always employed in Sistan, keeping up communication, garrisoning outlying towers, &amp;c. Of the regular troops, one regiment of infantry, usually only about 400 strong, is kept in Sistan, and the other is on leave at the men’s homes. Of the cavalry, about 150 are always in Sistan, the rest are on leave at their homes. The Karai battalions, one of which is supplied by Turshiz and the other by Turbat Hidari, are occasionally sent for a tour of duty in Sistan, and in 1880 when I was passing through the Turbat Hidari district, the Karai battalion of that place was just returning after a tour of duty of three years in Sistan, but unless there are signs of trouble it is not usual to keep any troops in Sistan except the two battalions raised in the territory of the Amir of Kaian, and these are usually relieved once a year. The climate is very hot and trying in Sistan during the summer, and the service is very unpopular amongst Persian troops, if kept there at that period of the year. I was told by an officer of the Karai battalion whom I met, that the mortality amongst his men during their three years tour of duty in Sistan had been great. The climate, however, in winter, is good. The whole of the northern portion of the territory of the Amir of Kaian is very mountainous. The mountains are not generally lofty, I should think the highest peak is not more than 10,000 feet, but the whole of the country is at a high level, very little of the northern portion being below 4,000 feet, and a great deal even over 5,000; the summer is very hot, and the winter is very cold, snow falling in large quantities, and remaining for a considerable period on the higher part of the country. Towards the south it is bounded by the Lut, or desert which separates it from Baluchistan, and from Bam and Karman. On the east it is bounded by Afghanistan, and on the west by the Persian salt desert, and the Tun and Tabbas district. The heat in the summer in the southern districts is terrific. The water supply is very small, and the kariz, if there is not a good fall of snow in the winter, are apt to dry up. Enough grain is not produced in the country for the consumption of the people, and grain is largely imported from Sistan, where the quantity produced is far beyond the requirements of the population. The water supplied by the kariz is used largely for growing crops other than grain. Tobacco, poppy for opium, cotton, and saffron are very largely grown. Saffron is a speciality of the Kaian district, and is said to be superior to that grown anywhere else, except, perhaps, in Kashmir. When I was at Birjand, saffron was selling for about five shillings an ounce, but this is far beyond the usual price, which is said to be about two shillings an ounce. Saffron is the produce of the flower of a yellow crocus, and it is one of the articles from which the Amir draws a large part of his revenue. A much greater proportion of the people are engaged in manufactures than is usual in other parts of Khurasan. In many villages the carpet manufactories are numerous, and employ many people, notably at Duruksh, near which place I passed, and at Cask, which I visited. Kurk, a stuff made of the fine under-wool of the goat, and known in India as pashmina, is largely manufactured and exported to Afghanistan and India. Socks are also knitted and sent to other parts of Persia. The quantity of opium exported from the districts, subject to the Amir of Kaian, is very considerable, while the quantity consumed in the country is enormous. Mir Alam Khan, the Amir of Kaian, is quite the most powerful chief I have met in Khurasan. His rule is a severe one, but he is not unpopular with the people, except 8062 . I34 , , • mnptl disliked and is believed to have extorted from the people in Sistan, '* er ? h ® '* ^ j he rev ; nue which he is bound to credit to the Persian a sum greatly m ex - ' 1 sum credited eac h year by the Amir to the Government. 1 was ba]uks or countie8 under him was from 22,000 to 23 OOO*tornan™ but this sum was not really paid in.

The sums payable each year vary and cannot be accurately “when^he Sistan Boundary Commission, under Sir Frederick Goldsmid, visited this nart of the world to lav down the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan in Sistan thev met with a great deal of opposition from Mir Aiam Khan, who appears to have looked upon the mission as one sent to deprive him of his just rights. The Persian Commissioner, Mirza Maasam Khan, was playing false, frightening the Amir of Kaian by telling him that the object of the mission was to deprive him of Sistan, and getting large bribes out of him to prevent this happening. The Persian Govern ment evidently did not wish to help the Commission when they appointed a man like Mir za Maasam Khan to be their Commissioner. He is now in Mashad, and is the means of communication between the British Agent, the Russian Agent, or any foreign agent who may arrive at Mashad, and the Rukn-ud-Dowlab, the Governor General. In fact, he is a sort of Foreign Secretary. I was informed by Mirza Abbas Khan, the British Consular Agent, that he is most obstructive, and that he found it impossible to get anything done through him. He is well known to be a strong partisan of Russia. Mir Alam Khan, some nine months after the departure of the British Mis sion from Sistan, was shut up in Nasrabad, the chief town, by a revolt of the Sistanis. A force of two regiments of infantry and about 600 cavalry, with two guns, were sent to his assistance, and arrived at Neh on the border of Sistan, but they were not able to advance beyond that place. From about the middle of December 1873 to about the middle of March 1874, Mir Alam Khan was besieged in the fortress of Nasrabad. Outside, but connected with it by a low wall, is the village of Husainabad. That place was captured by the Sistanis, and the Amir was closely shut up in the town itself At this time he began to treat with the rebels, and through Ibrahim Khan of Chakansur, who, though a subject of Afghanistan, is father-in-law of Amir Mir Alam Khan, the terms for the surrender of Nasrabad were agreed to. At this time news arrived that six Persian regiments were advancing to reinforce the Persian troops already at Neh. Mirza Muhammad Husain Mustofi arrived from Mashad, and pacified the country on condition that Mir Alam Khan should cease to govern, and should not interfere in Sistan. Shortly after this the Simsam-ul-Mulk arrived’ as Governor of Sistan. He attacked and plundered the villages situated in Persian territory of Sherif Khan, a Nharui Baluch Chief, who retired to Kala-i-Fath, on the Halmand river within Afghan territory. Ibrahim Khan, of Chakansur, also abandoned the villages which he held in Persian territory, and retired to Chakansur in Afghan territory But ^^ nd ^ Ct u 0f thG ^^^-M-Mulk was not approved, and he was succeeded early in 1874 by Muhammad Jafir Khan Kajar, son of Muhammad Wali Khan. In December 1874, Muhammad Jafir Khan Kajar was recalled, and Mir Alam Khan, the Amir of Kaian, was again appointed Governor, but he having been summoned by the Rukn- ud-Dowlah to Mashad refused to come. He was again deprived of Sistan md Muhammad Jafir Khan agaia reinstated as Governor.

He has had a very turbulent life, alternately fighting Turkomans, Afghans, and Baluchis, with an occasional campaign against his cousins, the Chiefs of Furg, a very strong place in his own country, who have no less than three times revolted against him. He struck me as a man that it would be more desirable to have as a friend than an enemy. In his earlier days he is said to have rather inclined towards the Suni doctrines, but at present he is a very staunch Shiah. He is allowed a good deal more independence than is permitted to other Persian governors. Mir Alam Khan, Amir of Kaian, and Dervish Aly Khan, of Khaf, are, I believe, more inclined to be friendly to England than most of the Khurasan Chiefs, and, iii case of assistance being wanted for an army advancing from India to the assistance of Herat, Mir Alam Khan could render valuable aid, for not only could a considerable number of camels be drawn from the district under his rule, but provisions from Sistan would be urgently required. Corn is largely exported from Sistan to the neighbouring provinces of Afghanistan. At present Mir Alam Khan has not definitely thrown in his lot with the Russians, as the more northern chiefs of Bujnurd and Kuchan have done. I am told the Chief of Bujnurd has become little more than a Russian Governor, and it cannot be long before his example is followed by the Chiefs of Kuchan, Daragez, and Kalat Nadari. Russia has so much to offer them which is attractive to a Persian, Russian orders, dresses of honour from the Shah, and even titles. A title and a dress of honour was given by the Shah to the Chief of Bujnurd for his services in forwarding provisions to the Russian camp during the siege of Geok Tepe. Before the Crimean war English influence was paramount in Persia, but, since that event, Russian influence has entirely superseded that of England, and at present, if there was war between England and Russia, Persia could only be counted as an enemy. Though our influence in northern and north-western Persia is gone, and it would almost be impossible to obtain our former influence, still something might be done to prevent a powerful chief like the Amir of Kaian from falling into the hands of Russia. From his position in Sistan and influence with the Baluchis, he could be used very much to our detriment in Baluchistan and Afghanistan if he became a Russian tool. While I was in Birjand two Russian agents, educated Armenians from near Baku on the Caspian, arrived there. They gave out that they were purchasing cattle for the Russian commissariat at Askabad, and I believe this was one of their objects, but I cannot help thinking that they were chiefly sent to get information about Sistan and the Baluchis. They purchased some cattle* but I believe not many. They only went to the borders of Sistan, and did not enter that country, as it was during the height of summer, when Sistan is very unhealthy and very hot', but they expressed their determination to return shortly and proceed to Sistan. It seems to me nothing would be so conducive to keeping up English influence as having a British officer residing and travelling about from Sistan to Mohsinabad, near the Huri Rud. There are, I know, many objections to keeping a British officer in Mashad, but I think all objects would be attained if we had a British officer on the Perso-Afghan frontier to keep our Government fully informed of what was passing, and, above all, to show the border chiefs and governors, both Afghan and Persian, that England was awake and watching events, and not leaving the game entirely in the hands of Russia. Over and over again Persians of note have said to me, “ England is “ sleeping a hare’s sleep, and not watching events.” Persians use the expression “ a hare’s sleep ” for a very deep and careless slumber. I am not at all a Russophobist. I think that Russia is doing a great and good work in Central Asia, and that there is plenty of room in Asia for both the Russians and the English, but I do think it is urgently necessary to have an English officer on the Perso-Afghan frontier to show that England has some interest in what is passing in this country, and keep up English influence, which is decaying, from want of seeing and hearing anything of her. Chapter V. Journey across the Lut Desert towards Karman. Birjand is an unwalled town containing about 14,000 inhabitants. It is built on the bank of a river which seldom contains water. Sometimes after heavy rain a great flood comes down and damages a portion of the buildings on its bank. It is rather a poor looking town, and has no regularly built bazaar. I was informed that36 i i „Tf Vn&lt;5 « 4 Pveral caravansGraiSj and m the Amir proposed to construct a brge ^ amount 0 f trade.

Herat is well supplied with goods from Bombay, which are brought mn either Yazd or Karman ? I met a large caravan belonging to two merchants of Herat, Hidar Kuli and Ghiilam Hidar, who were on their way from Yazd to Herat, and it was laden almost entirely with British goods. They were going the short roa f and f Yazdun. Russia is making very great and successful efforts to stop the British goods into parts of the country over which she has influence. I will, how ever, go into this subject more fully when I come to speak of it on my arrival at Mashad The only fortification at Birjand is the Ark, or citadel, where the few guns belonging to the Amir are kept. It is, howe^r, a place of no strength, being com- manded from several points, and the water supply can be cut off. It is sufficient for what it is intended, namely, to resist people unprovided with guns 1 here is an old ruined fort on the hill on the opposite side of the town to the citadel, which, though in a stronger position, has no water supply, and is abandoned and in luins. I remained in Birjand until the 25th May. I made great inquiries while I was there as to the road across the Lut, or great desert, which extends all over the country to the south ward, dividing Birjand and Sistan from Bam and Ivarman. 1 his desert from Neh to Karman was crossed hv the Russian mission under Rhanikoff. I was very anxious to discover if there was any better road than that which Khanikoff had followed, he having struck almost straight across the Lut. I found there was a road not very much longer, by which only a small portion of the desert would he crossed. I his road might prove important in case it was required to support an army marching from India to Herat through Afghanistan, by sending a force from Bandar Abbas, through Persia to Herat, and 1 thought I had better explore it for the good of the Intelligence Department, as it had been travelled by no European. In the winter it is practicable, but in May and June the heat is always intense. If I had not gone at this season it would, however, have been impossible for me to visit the road at all. I made five long hi arches, aggregating 130 miles, dow n this road, and the same distance hack. I returned to Birjand on the 7th Juue, having been away 14 days and travelled 260 miles in weather much hotter than that of India, though in Persia, however hot the day may be, the nights are always cool. I unfortunately did not keep a record of the thermometer, but on one of the cooler days when I was able to get at my thermo meter it marked 109 degrees in the shadiest and coolest spot I could find. To make long marches over the desert in this heat was very trying, and I made two marches of 34 miles each, besides several others nearly as long. On leaving Birjand, which 1 did on the 25th May 1882, the road passes over a stony plain, leaving the mountains known as Kuh Bakaran on the left. At four miles the village ofAmirabad is passed, and at 23 miles the small town of Khusf is reached. Several villages are seen to the right of the road, on the banks of the Khusf’ stream, which is the same as that on which Birjand is built. Khusf is a flourishing little place of about 6,000 inhabitants, where supplies in considerable quantities are procurable. The Khusf river supplies a large quantity of water for irrigation, which, though brackish, is quite fit for this purpose. The town has a kariz of good water drawn from the river higher up. Soon after passing Khusf the water of the Khusf stream becomes so salt as to he useless. It flows near a hill, which is marked in my map Kuh Gurmab, and is finally lost in the desert some 30 miles beyond Naiband. From the top of a mountain above Naiband I was able to see the spot where this stream kavirs or forms a salt marsh. Khusf is the seat of a manufactory of kurk, but it is not of such good quality as that ol Sar-i-Cha. Though the Khusf river only contains a small quantity ol visible water in its bed, water is found at all seasons in plenty by digging in the bed of the river to a depth of about two feet, and kariz, or underground canals, are carriedoff from it in all directions. The river is sunk considerably below the level of the surrounding country, but the high banks are watered by kariz brought from points higher up the river. I think the wonderful patience shown by the Persians in the labour of excavating these underground tunnels for water is surprising. Every drop of water has to be bored for and tunnelled for through miles of ground before the precious liquid reaches the field for which it is intended. In this barren and arid country nothing will grow without artificial irrigation. The work of tunnelling is a very dangerous one, and a well digger was killed by the falling in of a tunnel at which he was working the day after I reached Birjand. My mirza or secretary said to me, “ Snake charmers, lion tamers, and kariz diggers seldom die in their beds.” On the afternoon of the 26th May I left Khusf, and immediately after leaving tlm village crossed the stream which bears its name. At one mile I reached the village of Nasrabad. and at six miles from Khusf entered some low broken hills. At 10 miles I reached the small village of Dastajird. There is a spring of good water and a very little cultivation surrounding the few houses. After leaving this village the road passes for several miles through broken country, crossing several beds of dry water courses. At 20 miles from Khusf a small kariz of water, with a tower near it, inhabited by one family, and also a small mud caravanserai, are reached. The water from this kariz, though sweet, was much defiled by the numerous flocks of sheep and goats which are watered here. This place is called Jambuk. At 12 miles beyond Jambuk, over a fair country, the large village of Khur is reached. It belongs to the district of Tun-ou-Tabbas, and is under the Imad-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Tun-ou- Tabbas. He has a garrison of eight soldiers in the small fort. Though the land revenue of this village is paid to the Governor of Tabbas, the grazing tax on camels, sheep, and goats, which is considerable, is received by the Amir of Kaian. There is in fact a sort of joint possession. This village is in a very strong position, as it required to be, having been constantly liable to attack by bands of marauding Baluchis from the south-east. For the last ten years, however, the Baluchis have not raided about here. There is no doubt the rule of the Amir of Kaian has put down Baluch raids, and rendered this part of the country thoroughly safe, which it was not before. The road from Birjand to Tabbas and Yazd passes through this village. The best road from Birjand and Herat to Karman also passes through it, so that it is situated on two important roads. Between Khur and any place to the southward or to the eastward there is a large piece of desert. The desert to be crossed in this direction is not, however, so extensive as that crossed on the road from Neh to Karman. The people distinguish between that portion of the desert and this, calling that Lut, or desert, and the one to the eastward Beyaban, or “ without waters,” properly to be translated by ‘‘wilderness.” On the road to Tabbas, where the desert is narrowest, there are 60 miles without inhabitants, though brackish water is to be found at a few places. On the best road to Karman, by which I am travelling, there is a space of 78 miles without inhabitants, but on the road from Neh, directly across the Lut, there is a space, lam told, of about 120 miles, not only without inhabitants, but entirely without water or bushes. Khur is very curiously situated. On two sides of the village are steep cliffs, like the cliffs on the sea shore, about 30 feet in height. They are very abrupt, and have only two steep paths which it is just possible to ride up or down. At the foot of the cliffs there is stagnant water in large pools of considerable depth. Just beyond these pools the ground rises a little, and on this slightly rising ground the village of Khur is built. On one of the sides, where there are no cliffs, there is a marsh of con siderable extent, so that the village is in a very strong position indeed ; it could, of course, be shelled by artillery from the cliffs, but to an enemy unprovided with artillery the place would present difficulties. The salt river which I crossed the day after leaving Khur, and which kavirs, or forms salt marsh, to the southward of Naiband, takes its rise from this marsh. While I was at Khur, the son of Ibiahim Khan, of Chakansur, who had been 22 years at Tehran, living under the protection of the Shah, arrived there on the way to join his father at Ohakansur. On the evening of the 28th May I left Khur, with a dreary march of nearly 80 miles, over a very desert country, in prospect, which I proposed to do in three marches. I had to carry food for men and animals for two days with me. 1 had hired two guides mounted on jambaz, or fast-trotting camels, but both guides and camels proved to be utter impositions. The guides did not know the road, and the fast- trotting camels had the greatest difficulty in keeping up*with a fast-walking horse. The road from Khur leads over a plain, and at the end of eight miles a haoz of good water was passed. This was the last good water we were to taste for th.ee days. After leaving this haoz, one of the guides, who was an utter impostor, attempted a 8062 . Kshort cut, over which he had never been, and lost his road We had to he down in the desert and wait for dawn, hut when morning broke, the guide still did not know where he was It was not very pleasant to think we were lost in the desert; however, after wandering about for two hours, we found the well we were seeking. There were II 1 ° d-f.vo+rarl of thp hnttftm of a ravine. They were about six feet deep. alter wandering auum, iui t Z r j two small wells situated at the bottom of a ravine. They were about six feet deep, and contained plenty of water, which was decidedly brackish but drinkable. One well was rather better than the other. The country passed over was very barren and desolate; sand hills of a sort of hard sand and stones over it, into which the horses’ hoofs broke at every step, but it was not shifting sand. Here and there patches of a sort of kavir, called rotten kavir, were passed. The salt water had rendered the sandy soil rotten, and the horses’feet sank deep in it. We passed over several pieces of such kavir, but they were of no great extent. At 18 miles from Khur, the bed of a wide dry salt river was crossed, which was full of pure white salt. This river is the one that takes its rise from the marsh at Khur. It must bring down a large quantity of water at certain seasons, as its bed was very wide. The wells at which I halted were called Bala Band. The heat was really terrific. My servants and the horses and mules suffered very much. I did not pitch my tent, but raised a thick double blanket on two poles, and courted the hot wind, which resembled the air from a hot blast furnace. About six miles off, but not on the road by which we travelled, there were five wells of brackish water, around which about 20 families of Arab nomads were encamped. The water of these wells, though brackish, was said to be quite drinkable. They are known as Cba Tuni. I took the bearings of them. The wells of Bala Band, where I encamped, are favourite halting-places for marauding- Baluchis. ^ ' In spite of the great heat, we marched at 5 p.m., with a march of 34 miles in prospect. The heat was still very great, but as we had so long a march in front of us before we could reach water, it was necessary to start early. Soon after leaving Bala Band we saw a female antelope with two young fawns, the only living things we encountered in the 78 miles between Khur and Naiband. At five miles from Bala Band we struck into a well marked track. Bala Band not being on the actual road but five miles off it, we had gone there for the sake of water. Soon after striking the track, a curious black hill, very steep and abrupt on all sides, was passed This hill can only be ascended at one point, and is known as Kala Baluch. It is said that Baluchis m former years, when on plundering expeditions, used this hill as a fortress collecting their plunder here before returning to Baluchistan. At 14 miles from our camp we passed a haoz, but it contained no water. The guides said thm ml; * and up to about the middle of May, the haoz usually havf water' n them bu“' tl e passing caravans from Yazd and Karman drink them dry by the end of May A 21 miles we passed another haoz, also waterless, and at 34 miles reached the bed of dry river where there was supposed to be water. It was now dawn and , £ d ,° f inarching since 5 o’clock the previous evening.

I was glad of the burning wind, though it covered us with dust and sand. The water looked too dirty to wash in or attempt to bathe, being of a red colour, but it tasted well enough. At six in the evening we left Shand Aly Rezah, and from here are supposed to nave entered the real Lut desert. Up to this we had occasionally seen bushes and camels could find scanty grazing here and there in the desert, but now ve«-etation entirely ceased. At eight miles we crossed a narrow salt river bed. There°was no water, but the whole bed was covered by a thick layer of beautiful white salt. For many miles we had seen in the far distance the mountain peak of Naiband At 20 miles we reached the village of Naiband, which is perched on a hill, a spur of the Naiband range which we have seen for the last two days. The highest peak is about- five miles distant from the village of Naiband. This hill, though it can be seen from a great distance, is not, I believe, more than 6,000 feet in height. We arrived a little before midnight, but did not enter the village till next morning. We lay down at the edge of a grove of date palms, and waited till dawn. I got a room in the village, and though it was a very poor place, it was a great thing to get a roof of some Sort between oneself and the fierce sun, which blazed upon this desert land. Naiband is a village of about 400 inhabitants, and there is a small stream of good water, but the amount of ground fit for cultivation is very small indeed. Small quantities of wheat and barley are grown, but the principal product is dates. 4 he chief resource of the people is selling provisions to the caravans which pass through, pilgrims from Karman going via Tun to Mashad, and caravans of merchandise going from Yazd and Karman to Birjand and Herat. The people of Naiband act as guides to these caravans across the desert. I went out about a mile and a half along the Karman road, where it crosses the Naiband range, and having ascended one of the peaks had a splendid view over the most desolate scenery that it is possible to imagine, miles and miles of country utterly burnt up. The people call it the burnt soil, and say nothing will grow on it. It is not salt, except in places of no great extent, where a salt river enters it, but it is a barren, bare, burnt-up plain, about 3,000 feet above sea level, with many rocky ranges of hills, rising about 1,000 or 1,200 feet above the bare plain. It quite pained the eye to look out upon it. 4 hey assured me that at this season on the road to Khabis, which is across the desert, there is no water for more than 150 miles, and at no season is there any water, except in one or two places, where it can be found for a short time after rain. Caravans do, however, cross this portion of the Uut occasionally in winter. It is, they say, quite impossible in summer, and if any of the inhabitants are lost only a few miles out in the Lut they almost invariably perish. The Lut desert was crossed by a road, leading from Neh to Karman, by the Russian mission under Khanikoff, but no European since the days of Marco Polo has, I believe, travelled bv the Naiband road. A road from Naiband to Karman, skirting the edge of the desert, passes by a small town called Rawar, and though it crosses a more or less barren country, does not cross the Lut, and water is found at reasonable distances apart. {Vide Route No. 1.) The distance from Naiband to Karman via Rawar is about 200 miles. Naiband is a sort of oasis. In every direction it is surrounded by desert, but on this road io Karman the difficulties have been smoothed over as much as possible by building hoaz, and some caravanserais, as this is one of the chief routes from Southern Persia to Mashad. Though I was very glad to reach Naiband, I should be very sorry indeed to live there. I spent the 31st May and the 1st and 2nd June in the place, and the people declared that the great heat had not then commenced. 4Te climate of Persia is certainly trying, as the winters are so bitterly cold, and the summer in these parts is hot. The people of Naiband complained that they had had no date crop for two years, because a heavy fall of snow two years previously had killed 2,000 ot their date palms, and damaged the rest. The crop this year, however, promised to be an abundant one. Naiband is a picturesque looking place, perched up as it is on a crag. Many houses have watch towers, the position having been chosen entirely with a view to defence against the Baluchis. They say they were dreadfully harried by Baluchis until 10 years ago. Even now bands of Baluchis wander over the country occasionally. Two years ago several bands passed up by Naiband, and plundered the country near Tabbas. (4'hese were the bands I heard so much of at the time, and to avoid whom I had to make two long night marches near l^abbas.) After crossing the Lut they halt to refresh themselves at a spring called Chasma Iraki, about 13 miles from here, where there are a few date palms. 1 saw this place from the40 „, of a hill.

Naiband does not have been made by Baluchis, J P P j j, bit t all ,j the travellers who pass produce enough provisions ^'i f ' Khusf and Khur. Naiband, including the hmX^W^iarSgah 1 which belongs to it, contains about 400 inhabitants. There fs a nice steam of good water, which gushes down the mountain side just above this hamlet and is lukewarm at its source. A prophet is supposed to have lived at the 'pot where the stream gushes out. Naiband pays no revenue to any one, hut is bound to furnish 10 matchlock men under the II,an system to the Governor of Tabbas, and to protect the road. Provisions of all sorts are very dear at Naiband, camels and sheep cannot be kept, as the desert is perfectly bare, and there is no grazing for them. A very few stunted goats are fed on the edge of the cultivation The dates are not good, and the only thing it produces in any quantities are date palm baskets, with which all the neighbouring country is supplied. Some oi the people also work at a lead mine, situated in the mountain above the hamlet oi Ziaratgah, but the quantity produced is not large. It sells at about twopence a pound at Rawar, but that entails the carrying of it 100 miles. Donkeys and the very few oxen that are kept for ploughing are not turned out to graze, as there is nothing for them to eat, but are stall fed. The Persian ibex (capra bezoartico) is plentiful on the mountains. . . The Birjand or Khusf river falls into a dak or depression m the Lut some 20 miles to the south of Naiband, as also does the river that rises from the marsh at Khur. I saw this place with its salt glittering white from the top of a mountain a little beyond Naiband. I was informed that camels sometimes sink in this kavir when trying to cross it while in a marshy state. Though it was so hot in the day, the nights were always deliciously cool, and one always required a blanket at Naiband. Six miles off, out in the desert, there is a spring of hot water, called Dig-i-Rustum. While I was here a lars;e caravan of camels arrived from Kuh Banan, in the Karman district, laden with rhonas, a dye stuff, and going to Birjand. I was much interested in hearing of Kuh Banan, as it is one of the places mentioned by Marco Polo as on his route. Kuh Banan is described as a group of villages about seven farsakhs, or 26 miles, from Rawar. I cannot help thinking the road travelled by Marco Polo from Karman to Kaian is the one by Naiband. Marco Polo speaks of Tun-ou-Cain; no doubt, as oointed out by Colonel Yule, Tun and Kaian are meant. It is curious that though Tun does not belong to the Kaian district at present, but is attached to Tabbas, it is itill called, not Tun only, but Tun-ou-Tabbas. It would quite as naturally belong to talari as to Tabbas, and in that case w r ould undoubtedly be known as Tun-ou-Kaian, exactly in the form used by Marco Polo. After three days I returned to Birjand by he same road by which I came. On my return I became seriously unwell for some ten days, in consequence of the ;reat heat and the bad water I had drunk on my journey in the desert. The Amir of Caian and his two sons were most civil, doing everything in their power to make my tay a comfortable one. He sent daily to inquire after my health, and offered to send is private physician to attend upon me, but this offer I declined. He has got a bad tame among Europeans, in consequence of his treatment of the Sistan mission, but here were reasons for that. He was persuaded to it by the Persian Commissioner rho accompanied Sir Frederick Goldsmid. Before leaving I presented him with a ireech-loading carbine, a pair of field glasses, a revolving pistol, a goshawk, and a silver i'atch. I also gave presents to his servants. He sent me three small carpets of good are manufactured at Birjand. One day, when 1 was breakfasting with nan, I met Sartip Nur Muhammad Khan, the Kandahari Sardar who af with Avnh Khan I Pari n i• . .nguu g ui a.i uie agnail cmeis. i nougn ne is a great friend and partisan of yub Khan and was at this time in exile on Ayub Khan’s account, lie tried to imnress 3 0 „ me that he himself was the cause of Ayub Khan’s losing the battle before andahar, with Amir Ahdur Rahman Khan, and stated that he corresponded with the mu Ahdui Rahman Khan before the battle, and wished me to understand that thetreachery of Ayub Khan’s troops on that occasion was due to him. He also openly spoke of Ayub Khan’s want of courage. I had gathered from many things that Ayub Khan was wanting in courage, but Nur Muhammad Khan was the first of his own immediate followers whom I had heard openly charge him with cowardice. On the 27th June I left Birjand and marched out to the Persian border on the Farah road. My farthest camp in this direction was at the village of Duruh. My first march was to a village called Isfazar. The road is a good one leading up the Birjand valley to the village of Bojd, where a slightly rising ground is crossed, which divides this valley from the next. Bojd is a flourishing village with much cultivation, especially orchards. After passing the slight rise at Bojd the road passes over a plain until at the eleventh mile from Birjand a fine haoz or reservoir is reached. From this haoz the village of Aliabad is seen about a mile to the right. At 21 mijes a range of hills is ap proached very closely, and at this point there is a spring of water known as Sar-i-Chasma. At 23^- miles the village of Babuk is reached, at 25 miles Tanak, and at 26 miles Isfazar. Tanak and Isfazar are two small villages, the latter has a small but strong fort, fast going to ruin. The whole road is passable for guns. I slept the night at Isfazar, and the next day marched to Furk, 21 miles distant. The road, after leaving Isfazar, passes for about two miles over a plain, and then enters the Mominabad range of mountains. At 6^ miles from Isfazar the crest of the range is reached. The pass over it is called Godar Daramian, and the highest point of the pass is 7,600 feet above sea level. From Godar Daramian the road rapidly descends. For about half a mile on each side of the Godar, or pass, the road is very bad, and would have to be made for guns, and the guns would probably have to be passed over by hand, but except at this place the whole road is perfectly passable for artillery. At 14 miles from Isfazar the small hamlet of Doshingan is reached, and at 19 miles the flourishing village of Daramian, which is one mass of orchards, producing the most delicious fruit in very large quantities. At 21 miles the village and fort of Fork is reached. The road from the crest of the pass to Furk is through a narrow gorge in the mountains. Above the village of Furk a strong stone fort has been built. It is perched upon a pinnacle of a hill, high above the bed of the stream which forms the pass, The fort is of consider able size, and all the lower portion is built of stone laid in lime mortar. The upper courses, however, are of sun-dried brick. The towers and defences are of the most primitive description. The hill which rises behind the fort, at a distance of only three or four hundred yards, commands it, as also does a hill across the ravine which forms the pass, and this within easy artillery range. It might be difficult to take the fort without artillery, but even against mountain guns the place would be quite untenable. Water is led into the fort by a kariz, I am told. The garrison which consists of some 30 men, under a Naib or Lieutenant, refused to admit me, although I had a letter from the Amir of Kaian. The most absurd idea as to the strength of this fort prevails in the neighbourhood, though the Amir of Kaian, with his rattletrap artillery has taken the place three times within the last 30 years,—the last time only thirteen years ago. The village of Furk below the fort forms a sort of outwork. The fort of Furk is placed at the entrance of the Daramian pass. The pass is not a difficult one, and would be easy to force, as the hills on each side could be crowned without difficulty. While I was at Furk I received a visit from Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, a young man of about eighteen or nineteen years of age, who had also called upon* me at Birjand. He is the chief of Daramian and Furk. His grandfather and great grandfather were notable enemies of the Amir of Kaian, and even his father, whose name was Muhammad Ismail Khan, rebelled against the Amir of Kaian, and held the fort of Furk against him. They are friendly now, however, and the mother of the Amir of Kaian is an aunt of the young man who called on me. The family is one of importance, and, until suppressed by the Amir of Kaian, was very powerful on this border. 1 he descent of this family is as follows:—They originally came from Samarkand and built the fort of b urk, and were khans of this country of Tabbas and Furk. Mirza Rufih Khan, great grandfather of the young man who called upon me, w r as helped by the Afghans, and a great deal of fighting took place between him and the present Amir of Kaian. He took the Amir prisoner at a conference, and carried him oft behind an Afghan horseman, a man noted for his strength and daring, but the Amir on the road drew a pistol from his boot, shot the Afghan dead, and escaped on his horse. I he descent of the present chief from Mirza Rufih Khan is as follows:—Muhammad Khan, Hadji Ismail Khan, and Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, the present chief, who came to see me. I returned his visit, and saw many of his brothers and cousins. I was a good deal struck by the 8062 . L■ronn 42 i i a nponle showed of European politics. They asked after the Emperor of Cermany and Prince Bismarck, and knew a good deal about the latter. Genera y, ^cept ^bout Russia and England, and more rarely a man who has heard of trance, thpv know nothing of Europe or European affairs. . . « /left Furk on the 29th June, the road soon leaves the pass and enters on a plain for -m i -.rUiorpo on/i loro-p fort, of Tahbas Sunikhaneh is reached. It is, lor Furk on tne win auue, ujc . r v, ., i' i • s W hen the village and large fort of Tabbas Sumkhaneh is reai a strong fort, and is built on an artificial mound, probably the ruins of some 17 miles andent city^^The natives say that the mound on which it is built is formed by the ruins of the ancient city of Masinan. The Tabbas fort is, I am told, of exactly the same pattern as the forts of Herat and Farah, and tradition says that Herat, lab has, and Farah were all built by the same person. The fort is not in good repair, and would not be at all difficult to take, I believe even without artillery. Close to the gate the Amir has built a large round tower just inside the walls, as a sort of citadel. l am told that wherever excavations are made in the neighbourhood of the mound, bricks and remains of buildings are seen* 1 here is a small village outside the nails of the fort, but the chief portion of the houses are within the walls. Here there are a great number of windmills for grinding corn, which is raised on the Tabbas plain. I was informed that about 14,000 Kaian karwars were produced annually if the year was at all favourable. A Kaian karwar is about 320 lbs. Though the people have a wonderful idea of the strength of the fort of Tabbas, it is not really strong. It has long curtain walls, and the flanking towers are small and weak. It is just tit to keep out raiding Afghans or Turkomans. There is an entrance gate, and then, at a few yards distance, at an angle to the first gate, a second. A very small bag of powder would blow in the gate. Besides the wall there is a ditch, and at the far side of the ditch the remains of what is called a shirazi, but all this in the most complete ruin. I sent on a horse man of the Amir of Kaian’s, with a servant of my own, to announce my arrival. They were admitted, but when I got there a quarter of an hour afterwards I found the gates shut. It was a quarter to nine, and the Amir’s officer said he could not open the gates at night, and in spite of all that the Amir’s men with me could say they would not admit me. It appears that the Amir of Kaian had shortly before slit the ears of the commandant of the fort because he had left the gate open at night. I pitched my tent outside. I halted at Tabbas the next day, but the Amir’s officer in charge of the fort never came to see me all day, in spite of the Amir’s letter ordering him to treat me with all civility, and to let me go anywhere I pleased. I wrote to the Amir complaining of this man s conduct, and he not only sent him a reprimand, but ordered him to be taken to Gazik, where I was going, to apologize to me for his rudeness. The Amir’s mirza, who was in charge of the civil administration, came to see me as soon as I arrived, and was most courteous. On the 1st July I marched from Tabbas.* The road led over a fertile plain with many villages. At a little less than two miles I passed the village of Aliabad, and at three mrles Muhammadabad. 1 his village is built on a curious circular mound which has evidently been the site of an ancient fire temple. At seven miles the village of Dastjird is reached. Here the road turns towards the hills which we had seen on our left hand, and enters them at about the ninth mile from Tabbas The SS S ~ xrsBxt I matched from Rezah to Uuruh i passed over a plain for six miles when if entw-prf ti ’V’'? 1 ' ? ver 7 ’? atl rua&lt;i - The road is at this season dry. It runs throueh the . r tsi °^ a consl ^ era hle river which pass called Dinah^Makmn Knahf, the wZ uId f ^ ^ of , the road &gt; by a world. My guide said this river ran to sLTe wV a paSS ln this l ,art “f the have great doubt of the truth of this statement ’ T', '' wllat 1 afterwards heard. I '*«■&gt;’•“****&gt; w- ~ ;„ 2 ”i ss Imown^s Tun-ou-Tablls?^ 117 Tabbas Suui ^aneh, to distinguish it from the other Tabbas, which iswhich extends from Awaz, in Persia, to Anardara, in Afghanistan. In this Dasht- i-Na-Umad there are, I believe, two depressions, or daks, into which the rivers of the neighbourhood drain; one being near Anardara, and one more to the south ward. I believe none of the streams which rise in the mountains near Duruh and Lahno reach the Harud Rud, but are either lost in the plain or run into a dak. About the eighth mile after leaving Rezah, we turned out of the bed of the large stream we had been following, and entered another which is a feeder of it; leaving this, we went over some low rolling hills, with cross ranges in several directions. At 16 miles from Rezah, a very wretched village called Makhunak is reached. The people live in small stone huts, having very much the appearance, and being about the size, of large dog kennels. I never saw human habitations so small in my life. They were only about four feet in height and about the length of a man, and whole families live in these places. The people were most miserable, and had hardly any cultivation. Only women and very old men were to he seen in the village. The old men came forward and were very civil, but we could get nothing here but a little grass for our horses. The poor wretches really possessed nothing. They said they had been brought from Bokhara by Nadir Shah, and settled here. They had quite the Usbeg Turk type of face. I asked where all the young men were. They said a number had been taken by the Amir of Kaian, under the Iljari system, to garrison the border of Sistan. They complained very much that these men received no pay, and only If lbs. of wheat a day as food, which was hardly enough to keep life in them. The Amir insisted on one fourth of the males who were adults performing this duty. At this moment only one man in eight was away on this duty, hut the remainder were liable to be called away, at any moment, lor the defence of the border. The rest of the able-bodied men had gone across the frontier into Afghanistan, to Kala Kah and Farah, to earn a little money by reaping the harvest which was now ready. There was such an absence of any but aged men in the village that I had to take a boy on as guide to Duruh. Near Makhunak were two splendid mulberry trees of great age. These mulberries were of the European variety, and were covered with fine fruit, very different from the common little Eastern mulberry, the leaves of which are used for feeding silkworms, and whose fruit is so insipid. The road from Makhunak followed the dry bed of a wide river for several miles. I his river does not reach the Darud Rud, but is lost in the plain a few miles beyond Duruh. At 23 miles from Rezah, the road left the river bed at a point where there was a little cultivation, and a few inha bitants, who resided in two towers, and who were much alarmed by our arrival. This place is called Bagh Sang. At 30 miles we reached the very large village of Duruh. It is a poor place, not having a great deal of cultivation, but has about 2,200 inhabitants, and is important as being the last inhabited place in Persia on the road to Farah. 1 he first place in Afghanistan that is reached after leaving Duruh is the group of villages known as Kala Kah. The largest village of the group is said to he called Ur. The people said that Ur had a strong fort. Many hills w T ere in sight, and 1 took the beatings of several of them. The farthest away are about 20 miles off, and are said to be on the extreme Persian border. Beyond them is the Dasht-i-Na-timid, which is no man s land, not being considered to belong to either Persia or Afghanistan. I he boundary of Afghanistan on this side seems to be the Harud Rud. Duruh was visited by the Sistan mission under Sir Frederick Goldsmid, and the country to the southward has been mapped out. This was one of my reasons for coming here, because now I shall have a complete survey from Toman Aga on the Hari Rud down to Duruh, to winch point the survey of the Sistan Boundary Commission extends. From Duruh caravans go in five easy marches to Farah. , . , „ t i i j &lt; This part of the country contains many strongholds which formerly belonged to Hasan Snbah, the Chief of the Mulheds, or “ Assassins.” His head-quarters and the paradise which he made were both situated in the Alburj range of mountains north of Damghan. In the hill country.near Furk he had many adherents and several forts. The largest and strongest was that of Mominabad, which gives its name to the lange of mountains in which it is situated, which are called Kuh I ominami. ie or is now in ruins, but is said to be a strong place, and to cover a considerMile extent of ground. 1 was very sorry not to be able to visit it. Another fort of Hasan Sabah is situated on a hill above Tabbas Sunikhaneb, and I have very httle doubt tne n fort, the ruins of which are perched above Duruh was also one of his stiongholds. He seems to have had forts and adherents m all the mountain lands ot J^te , from the borders of Afghanistan to the Mediterranean Sea. It is cunous that a44 the inhabitants numbering about 300. It is a place of some little importance, as it has a number of hamlets depending on it. Including the hamlets, I was told it had 800 inhabitants, but it is a wretched ruined place. There is a road from Lahno across the Dasht-i-Na-Umid to Gazik, where I am going to-morrow, but I am told it is a very bad one. At some nine miles from Lahno, on this road, there is some cultiva tion at a place called Haftad Rud, or the “ Seventy streams.” Some of the inhabitants of Lahno live at Haftad Rud for a portion of the year and cultivate, but there are no permanent inhabitants. Haftad Rud, in spite of its great name, is a very small stream, and is lost in the Dasht-i-Na-Umid, neither reaching the Harud Rud, or even the dak or depression which exists in the plain. From Lahno we rode on the same day a distance of 21 miles to Rezah. The road was very bad indeed. We crossed two ranges of mountains, and the country was greener than usual, as there were numbers of the wild pistachio tree. One pass, which we crossed at about 10 miles from Lahno, was 5,700 feet in height. At seven miles before reaching Rezah we dropped into the dry bed of the large stream up which we had travelled the previous day to Duruh. We reached Rezah just as it became dark, after a 37 mile march over very bad mountain roads. On the 5th July I marched from Rezah back to Tabbas by a different route to that by which I came. It led along the banks of a salt stream which ended in a green marsh several miles in extent, where the Amir of Kaian had a large number of brood mares grazing. We struck our old road near the village of Aliabad when within about two miles of Tabbas. At this village the family of Sardar Mir Afzul Khan was residing. Mir Afzul Khan was himself absent, having proceeded to Mashad. He was Governor of Kandahar for Amir Shere Aly Khan, when our troops under Sir Donald Stewart first took Kandahar. I had received orders from Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to report on this man’s conduct, and I submitted from Mashad a long report, entering very fully into this subject. At 12 miles from Rezah the fort of Tabbas was reached, which I had previously visited and described. I rode inside the fort and thoroughly inspected the fortifications, which I found in a bad state of repair. I only stayed at Tabbas on this occasion for about an hour, and then went on to Gazik, distant 13 miles. The road is a good one passing over a plain. The Naib or deputy of the Amir of Kaian at Gazik was away at Awaz, a neighbouring village, when I arrived, but he rode into Gazik on hearing of my arrival. He was a fine looking man of about five and thirty. He had lost an eye in fighting with the Turkomans, and he had on the same occasion received a bullet wound in his chest. He showed me his wound. He had been out beyond Awaz on the road to Yazdun with a son of Mir-Panj Yusuf Khan Hazara my friend of Mohsinabad, and 11 horsemen, when they met a large party of Turkomans and fought them, and he received these wounds. He was very proud of a rifle and n horse the Amir of Tinian had n-i™ Id™ _ r i • J * . I/ 1116 dIla asheep, and the very small scrap of cultivation they had. On the 6th July the Naib and I rode out to the village of Awaz, which belongs to him. I presented him with a good silver watch, and he seemed very pleased. From Aw r az it is three marches to Yazdun. „ „ „ four „ Anardara. „ „ 3 , five ,, Farah. „ „ „ six „ Sabzawar in Afghanistan. The marches to Anardara as as follows :— Pujeh Jungah 16 miles. Cha Rig - 25 „ Cha Rusi - 20 „ Anardara - 16 „ Total - 77 miles. Natural pond of water, good and plentiful. Large well of good water. Large well of good water. Beyond Cha Rusi is a dak or dagal about four miles long, and about the same in breadth, of slightly brackish water, hut this dries up in summer. Small town, supplies in considerable quan tities. The road from Awaz to Subzawar is as follows:— Burj Gulwerda - - 16 miles. A tower and kariz of water. Chasbma Shurab - - 20 „ Spring of brackish water. Cha Shirinak - 24 „ Well of good water. Kariz Dasht - 20 „ Small hamlet, plenty of water. Abkhal - - 18 „ Large village, supplies procurable. Sabzawar - 12 „ Considerable town. Total - -110 miles. Gazik is a flourishing village, containing probably 1,400 inhabitants. It is built on a stream, which was at this season dry. When Ayub Khan first arrived in Persia, after having been beaten at Kandahar by the Amir, he and his followers, to the number of nearly 2,000, took up their quarters in Gazik and Tabbas and the neigh bouring villages. They told the most preposterous stories about the battle of Maiwand, declaring that, besides crowds of Indian soldiers, 12,000 Europeans took part in the battle, of whom 7,000 were killed, besides great numbers of Indian troops. They acknowledged that their own loss was severe. When I told the Naib that our whole force at Maiwand had consisted, at the outside, of 2,600 men, of whom not more at the most than 600 were Europeans, he evidently did not believe me. The Afghans said, celestial lights appeared over the dead Afghans on the night of the battle, and that a cry was heard of “ Ai Chahar Yar, Ai Chahar Yar!” which they looked upon as a sign from heaven. The people of Gazik and Tabbas are Suni Muham- medans, like the Afghans, and this baluk, or county of the Kaian district, is called Sunikhaneh, but even here, though the people were at one with the Afghans as to religion, the Afghans had made a very bad impression, and however popular a Russian occupation might be, certainly an Afghan occupation would be resisted by every man in the country, not on the ground of religion, but because there is a strong race hatred between the Persians and Afghans, I suppose the result of the cruelties practised by the Afghans on the many occasions when they have invaded Persia. I left Gazik on the 7th July, and marched towards Kaian. This road from Gazik to Kaian leads over the most hilly, stony, and difficult country I have ever travelled; I found it most trying for my horses and mules. The road, after leaving Gazik, went for many miles over a stony plain. After some four hours march, we reached a camp of Bahluli nomads, who were very civil, and presented us with some buttermilk, for which they would accept no payment, and invited us into their tents. We halted at their camp for about half an hour. Alter leaving the Bahluli camp, the road led into a broken country, but not yet mountainous. At 22J miles we reached the small village of Takhta Jan, and at 25 miles the Arab village of Sarab, which is 6,200 feet above sea level. All the country from here onward to Kaian is so elevated that, though it is the month of July, one can travel all day without feeling the heat. Sarab is a poor village, and the Arabs who inhabit it are semi-nomads. They live in housesstream m r Persians, much more tree ana muepenueiu, muugu pe f ; f ,r r dvn ry my only “ okr Ar^bic amongst themselves yet could speak perfectly civil. iney J i The did not know } 10W i on g they had been Persian, but with a ve *7 t rv they seemed very poor, and lived entirely upon f « ]ed rl^enoiir S^e irTas, howler,’ being reaped near ‘the village, tnd we managed to get a few cakes of unleavened wheaten bread, but not enough for w . h ®^ r [‘ a ! t J^ ith a „ u ; ( i e over a very bad road. It kept ascending anJ descending' thl whl day va^ifg from 5,000 J 6,000 feet At 12J miles the hamlet of Bamanrud is reached, and at 16 miles the hamlet of Fulad Mazar near which, on a conspicuous hill, there is an imam-zadeh, or shrine of one of the numerous relative^ of the Imam Rezah. At 19 miles we passed the hamlet of Sardab, and at 22 miles the flourishing village of Kabuda. Kabuda is not a large village, but the cultivation is good and extensive, and I saw some wheat fields here, just ready for the reaper, which would have done credit to the agriculture of any country. At 24 miles the poor village of Sher Khan is reached. I halted here one day, and on the 10th marched on, over the same trying sort of ground, up one stony hill and down another. At six miles from Sher Khan there was an encampment of nomad Bahlulis, at a small spring, where there are two houses and a little culti vation. These people declared that they had originally been brought from Barfrush, in Mazandaran. Their ancestors must have found the change from the green forests of Mazandaran to the desert hills of Kaian an unpleasant one. At 16 miles the village of Ujun is passed, and at 21 miles Khush is reached. Khush is a considerable village, but has little cultivation. From it I marched to Kaian, the road for the first 10 miles partaking of the usual broken character, but after that the plain of Kaian was entered on. It is a stony plain, with only cultivation at a few places where there is water. At 21 miles from Khush the town of Kaian is entered. It is quite the most ruinous inhabited place I have ever seen; it contains a most curious mosque of burnt brick, which had originally been a building constructed for some other purpose, and had been turned into a mosque. The inscription inside reads as follows:— “This building was completed for God, by the servant of God, Jamshid, the son of Kadut, the son of Jamshid, the son of Aly, the son of Ashraf, the son of Kazi Shums-ud- Din, the son of Aly Kaiana, in 796 Hegira.” Another inscription runs thus :— “ In the time of Shah Sulyman Sufewy, Sufshikun Khan repaired the mosque in the year 1080 Hegira. Also the pulpit was constructed by the experienced (here meaning carpenter) Muhammad Makim, son of Muhammad Waly, the son of Hafiz the son of Husain Aly Kakhki, in 1072 Hegira.’ * This mosque has suffered much from earthquakes, and is supported by very extraordinary buttresses. Tradition says it was a caravanserai in the time of the Gabrs. Kaian is the place known to the Greeks as Artacona, and was visited by b, i Mil! 'It, a 'nl' The l , , reseilt town ’ however, is not that visited by Alexander, but was built by the Usbegs. About two miles from the present town, on a steep hill are the rums of a very strong stone fort, many of the buildings of which and even the or the hil fort* S Th Sf !t° d ,,reaerVa v 0t j' . 1 climbed U P to this fort, called Kala Kuh if • ’ ? road was very bad indeed, and w r e found the ascent i diffirnlr one.

At the foot of the hill near these forts is an imamzadeh in good repair, but that is modern. Besides the two forts on the hills which are built of stone, there are, close to the present town, the ruins of an older Kaian built of mud. This Kaian was destroyed by a grandson of Amir Timur, no doubt Shah Rukh, who built the present town, and the Usbegs held Kaian until the time of Shah Abbas the Great, who expelled them. The inhabitants are largely of Arab descent, and a very large proportion, quite one third I believe, are Syuds, and more than a third are mollahs or priests. No one seems to do any work, and this may account for the state of the town. It has ceased to be the capital of the Amirs of Kaian, which it formerly was. A good deal of opium is grown, and the people are much addicted to both opium smoking and eating. The quantity consumed in the place is something extraordinary. I was assured that there was a man in the town who could, between eating and smoking, consume 12 ounces avoirdupois of opium in a day, and that he has repeatedly done this when carefully watched. I do not believe this statement, but I have been assured that an ounce, and even two ounces, of opium a day is often consumed by opium eaters in this part of the country. I was applied to by many people to supply them with a remedy to enable them to give up the use of opium. The Arabs of this place came here in the reign of Shah Sulyman of the Sufewian dynasty. It is the case that where there are many Syuds a town is never prosperous. I was surprised to hear one of my Muhammadan servants say that Syuds and mollahs were a bad lot, and my mirza, who would not go quite so far, said, “ So far as mollahs go I “ quite agree with you.” No one could visit this place without being struck with its state of utter ruin, which I belie ve is entirely due to the character of the population, as there is a fair supply of water and cultivation. I halted two days at Kaian, and, on the 15th July, marched by the most direct road to Khaf. The road passes over a plain for some six miles, when a salt river is crossed. It is the same salt river that I crossed between Behdadun and Muznabad, about half way between the two places. It is called Shur Rud, and drains into a depression about 2^ farsakhs beyond Niazabad, forming a piece of salt desert, said to be two farsakhs wide and 12 farsakhs long, in the direction of Sabzawar. The people oi Ghurian and Herat get their salt from this desert. The Shur Rud passes between the Kyber Kuh range and the Kwaja Shahz Kuh range t Soon after crossing this river, a low range of hills is entered which is called Kuh Waraz. After crossing this range, and entering the plain at 24 miles from Kaian, the small and poor village of Buznabad is reached. There is very little cultivation, and the people do not raise grain enough for their own consumption. They own camels and sheep, and trust to their flocks and herds, rather than to agriculture for their subsistence. The finest plane tree I have seen in Khurasan grew here. I did not pitch my tent, but bivouacked under it. A curious feature of this place, which the people themselves brought to my notice, was the very large number of graves. These were out of all proportion to the number of inhabitants the village ever could have contained. The people could not explain the presence of these graves, but said they were ancient. The next day, I marched early in the morning, about five, but did not reach my camping ground at Zuzan until nearly nine at night. The distance of Zuzan is between 42 and 43 miles. The road, after leaving Buznabad, passes over a desert plain for 24 miles, when a small spring is reached called Chasma Siah Kulla, near the Kyber range of hills. Here I found two shepherds, with a flock of sheep. The shepherds were of the Bah- luli tribe. They said there was a camp of their tribe not far from Buznabad, but they would not bring their families here because the place was too exposed to Turkoman raids. This piece of country between Buznabad and the Kyber range, which is quite uninhabited, is a favourite Turkoman raiding road. In their raids on Gunabad and the vill ages of the Tun district, they pass this way, aud a lonely spring, like this of Siah Kulla, is just the place they like to encamp, and rest their horses preparatory to a foray. I have come to the conclusion that the Turkomans, as a rule, do not really come very long distances to plunder. What they do, I have ascertained, after much inquiry from Turkomans and others, is to march tolerably fast from their own country, but not very fast, so as to avoid knocking up their horses. They then choose some lonely spring in the desert, not very far from the place they propose to attack. Here they lie hidden for several days, until their horses are completely rested, and they have acquired minute information, through spies, of all that is happening in the neigh bouring villages. The spies are generallyPersian captives w'ho have married I ur- kotuan women. When they have made aff their arrangements, they suddenly swoop down on the place they have determined to surprise. This is always done at early4.8 ,• at dusk. They carry off all fy can take without • i if nan. though he win ngut tu ^ 14- io wrifiolrlA tfl tlllTlk resistance.

The shepherds complained dreadfullv of the wolves, which, they said, almost nightly carried oft some ot the n sheep. Two sheep had been taken the previous night. About one mile after leaving Slab TCnlla or 25 miles from Buznabad, the road enters the Kyber range of hills, and is bad for about nine miles, winding about very much. There is one place in this pass where there is a spring of water. The heat while travelling through this pass was very «Teat Amongst these hills there are many wild pistachio trees, and they here attain the dimensions of a large tree. The pistachios produced by this tree are collected bv the Timuri Iliats, or nomads about here, in very large quantities. 1 he nuts, though very small are eaten, and from them oil is also extracted. They are, however, not nice, and do not taste like the cultivated pistachio, though the tree is the same. These nuts bear the same relation to the cultivated pistachio nut that the crab apple does to the good apple. At 33 miles we got out of the Kyber hills, and saw before us the old brick fort of Zuzan standing out a very conspicuous object. It appeared so near that we hoped soon to reach it, but was nine weary miles away, and we did not reach it till nearly nine at night. I halted the next day at Zuzan to examine the ruins. There are two villages here, one is called Zuzan, and the other, which is close by, Kasimabad. Zuzan was a large town once ; heaps of ruins covered a large extent of ground, amongst which men were busy digging up the earth for saltpetre, to extract which they washed the soil. In all ruined eastern town saltpetre exists, and is very generally collected. Zuzan is the place mentioned by Arian under the name of Susia, and was* visited by Alexander the Great. I went over the ruins of Zuzan with an old man, who said his ancestors had been here for a very long time. He was full of information about the town, and said it had been the capital of Persia, and showed me a large extent of old fortifications, which he called the New Palace. The ruins covered a very large area of ground, and the fortifications were quite traceable, but were all of mud, as most ruins in Persia except those of very early times are. He showed me the “ Red Garden,” where the whole population, men, women, and children, had been led out and slaughtered, on the capture of the town by Chingiz Khan. He said nothing would grow on that land, which had been watered by blood. He was very much disgusted when I told him that Chingiz Khan had never been in that part of the country, but was appeased when I told him that his son, Tului Khan, had been, and I believed the destruction of Zuzan was done by Tului Khan. After Zuzan was destroyed by the Mongols, it seems to been partially rebuilt by the Usbeg descendants of Timur. The present brick fort is evidently of their time, as is also the handsome Timur. The people digging for saltpetre declared they found nothing, but I did not believe this statement. Such cruel laws prevail that any one finding anything, and even giving it up to the Governors, is ruimftl, as he is accused of havfng much more, and of having it concealed, and generally ends in having all his property confiscated, soit is not surprising that coins and curiosities are so difficult to procure. I did secure a few good coins in Persia, but these were almost always purchased from goldsmiths in towns. The best of them is a daric or stater of King Darius, the oldest coin struck in Persia, and amongst the oldest positively known to have existed in the world. Every year, no doubt, an immense number of gold and silver coins are melted down in Persia, which would be priceless to collectors. On the 17th July I marched from Zuzan to Khaf. The road passed over a plain, and at miles the village of Asadabad was reached. At nine miles a range of hills, called Kuh Kalata, was entered, and was crossed by a very bad road. These hills are of no very great height. After crossing them a group of small villages is passed, called Boksum, Arzana, and Hafizabad. These small villages are known collectively as Kalata, or “ the hamlets,” and have given their name to the range of hills. It is curious that one of the peaks of this range is called Hormuzie. This is really the name of a spring situated on the hill. No doubt this name of Hormuz is a remnant of the old Gabr worship, but I could not hear that there was any temple or ruins near the place. After passing these hamlets some very low hills are crossed. These are outliers of the Kuh Kalata, and are close to Khaf. They are called Kuh Kwajah Yar, from a shrine of that name situated on them. I was very glad to get back to Khaf, after more than three months’ wandering. I found that my friend Dervish Aly Khan, the Timuri Chief, had been removed from his post of Governor, and Lutf Aly Khan, his brother, put in his place. I was very civilly received by Lutf Aly Khan, and given my old quarters. Chapter VI. The Aimak Tribes. I will here give an account of the nomad tribes of the Herat district, generally called Chahar Aimak. Originally the Chahar Aimak tribes were four, namely, Jamshedi, Firuz Kuhi, Taymuni, and Timuri, but at present at least six tribes are included under the above designation, namely, Hazara and Kipchak, in addition to the four first mentioned, and even some of the Barbari or more uncivilized portion of the Hazara who live in the mountain district between Herat and Afghan Turkistan are sometimes included. The majority of these people live in black goats’ hair tents, and trust chiefly to their flocks and herds for their livelihood. Both in Afghanistan and Persia, how ever, some portion of the tribes are settled. The most usual plan is to have a kishlak or settled winter residence, while in summer they wander about and visit their yeilaks or summer quarters in search of pasture for their flocks. The tribes I had most to do with personally are the Timuri, the Hazara, and the Jamshedi. I have also spoken with a few individuals of the Firuz Kuhi tribe, but I have had no personal intercourse with either the Taymuni or the Kipchak. I will speak first of the Timuri, whom 1 know best. The head-quarters of the Timuri tribe is in the Khaf district. I was able to collect particularly good information concerning them from Dervish Aly Khan, who is acknowledged to be the principal Chief of the tribe. The Timuri claim to be descended from Mir Syud Kasim, known as Mir Syud Kalal, who was the descendant of Imam Jafir Sadyk, the sixth in descent from Aly. Mir Syud Kalal lived as a hermit. The mother of Amir Timur Kurkhan, when on a pilgrimage to Mekka, was plundered by some Bedouin Arabs. On her return from the pilgrimage she complained to her son, who sent a large force and carried off 12,000 families of the Arabs, who had plundered his mother. On Amir Timur’s return journey to Samarkand, accompanied by the Arab captives, he passed near the hut occupied by the hermit, Mir Syud Kalal, and went to see him. At the request of the Syud, Amir Timur Kurkhan presented him with the 12,000 families of Arabs to be his slaves, and settled them under the leadership of Mir Syud Kalal at Turmuz, near Bokhara. Amir Timur also gave one of his daughters in marriage to the son of Syud Kalal. This son was called Mir Shams-ud-Din Muhammad, and succeeded his father as Chief, and brought his tribe and settled them in the Herat country. He was granted lands in Bukwa and Zamindawar for his tribe. He himself remained at Herat, and was buried at Khwaja Tak. Khwaja Tak is a small shrine still existing, close to the town of Herat. It is generally the site of one of the besiegers’ batteries when Herat is besieged. His descendants remained in Herat and became very powerful, especially one of them, who was known in Herat as Hadji Khan. In his time the Timuri were settled 8062. N4r t \ 50 !»• a r the Afghan province north of Herat, between the ^ Mur^hab and Huri Rud rivers.’ A large portion of the tribe moved over from Badkis and occupied the Khaf district, which then belonged to Afghanistan. The son o da ji , A nir Kalich Khan, rose to great influence in Herat in the time of hah Mahmud. Amir Kalich Khan quarrelled with Mir Husain Khan, the wuzir of Shah Mahmud, and killed him. Amir Kalich Khan then seized the citadel of Herat, and declared himself a partisan of Shah Zaman and against Shah Mahmud He gave up he citadel to Shah Zaman, and when Shah Zaman had to retire from Herat Amir Kalich Khan went to Khaf, and withdrew his tribe from Badkis to Khaf, where a portion were already settled, and having gone to Tehran and visited Futh Aly Shah, the then, a ofPersia, he declared himself a Persian subject. Besides the Timun who followed Amir Kalich Khan to Persia, a considerable amount of land in the Sabzawar district was occupied by Timuri, and they remained there. The present Chief of the 1 imuri, who remained, and who are said to number 1,000 families, is Abdula Khan, who was in charge of the Afghan border while Ayub Khan was at Khaf. Other portions of the 1 imuri tribe who remained in Afghanistan are still settled at Bukwa and Zamindawar. 1 here are said to be, altogether, 4,000 families of Timuri still remaining in various parts of Afghanistan, but I believe this estimate to be excessive. In the Khaf district and in the neighbouring mountains of Bakharz there are about 2,500 families of Timuri under Dervish Aly Khan. I estimate their numbers at about 10.000 individuals. They are very Arab looking in features, though larger and coarser made men than Arabs, showing some admixture of Turanian blood. Their language is Persian. In the Khaf district there are said to be 40 villages, in most of which there are some Timuri, but this includes very small hamlets. I should estimate the population of the Khaf district, including Timuri, to be about 17,000. Besides the Timuri settled at Khaf there are two other bodies settled in Persia. About 2.000 families of Timuri are settled in the country near Mashad and in the country towards the fort of Mozdaran, and southward in the Pusht-i-Kuh-i-Jam plateau, also in Turbat-i-Shaik Jami. The Chief of this portion of the tribe is Sartip Aly Murdan Khan, who lives at Mashad, and who was most civil to me, and to whom I presented a good rifle. In return he gave me a Turkoman rug. He is a man of much influence, and is one of the few people in Mashad who are very anti-Russian. Besides these two bodies of Timuri who have long been settled in Persia, in 1858, when the Hissam-i-Sultaneh surrendered Herat to the Afghans under the treaty with England, about 1,000 families of Timuri from Afghanistan, who had taken a prominent part on the Persian side, left Herat and settled in Persia, being given lands in the Kuh Surkh district, south of Nishapur. The name of the Chief of this portion of the Timuri is Ataullah Khan. He has at present not more, at the outside, than 500 families, most of his people having returned to Afghanistan. He commands a regiment of cavalry known as Jamaat-i-Mervi, which consists of 250 men. Aly Murdan Khan, the Timuri Chief before mentioned, also commands a regiment of cavalry, called Jamaat-i- fimuri, of 500 men, and has the rank of Sartip or Colonel in the Persian service. The Timuri are Surds, though Dervish Aly Khan and his brother Lutf Aly Khan have adopted the Shiah faith. The Persian Goverument, by their ill-treatment of the nomads settled on their border, have alienated all the Timuri from their Govern ment, and this tribe would welcome and make common cause with any invader I believe with even the hated Afghan. ’ The next tribe of the Aimaks, of whom I will speak, are the Jamshedis. Their head-quarters are at Kushk, about 40 miles north-east of Herat, on the stream of the same name, which tails into the Murghah. They are a powerful tribe, originally o*' Persian origin, but they have become to a certain extent Turkocized, by living in such in con- • • • C;:r , , Alley are a powerrul tribe, ongi Persian origin, but they have become to a certain extent Turkocized by living immediate contact with Turkomans.

Khan Aga had led an adventurous life previous to obtaining the favour of the Amir Sher Aly Khan. The Jamshedis, some years ago, left Afghanistan under the leadership of Mir Ahmad Khan, and the greater part of the tribe joined the Khan of Khiva. They were settled near Urganj. Mir Ahmad Khan, the Chief of the Jamshedis, was wounded in the action fought near Sarakhs, when Muhammad Amin Khan, the Khan of Khiva, was killed in 1855. Mir Ahmad Khan Jamshedi was afterwards killed in battle with the Yomud Turkomans. About 28 years ago, after the death of Mir Ahmad Khan, the Jamshedis left Khiva and returned to their own lands in Badkis, the country between the Murghab and the Hari Rud. They returned under the leadership of Mahdi Kuli Khan or Khan Aga and his two brothers, Alla Kuli Khan and Abdula Khan. They had been about 12 years absent from Afghan territory when they returned, but both their departure and their return were before the Russians took possession of Khiva. I have little doubt the Russians will soon contend that the Jamshedis are not Afghan subjects, indeed M. Lessar infers as much in his letters published in the “ Golos,” so this tribe is particularly interesting at present. About 500 families of the Jamshedis were settled in Persia, most of them being at Khanibist, near Mashad. A good many of these have, however, returned to their native country. Those that remain are in two divisions. Zulfikar Khan is Chief of the Jamshedi subdivision and Hadji Muhammad Amin Khan of the Raoti subdivision of the Jamshedis. The Jamshedis since their return to Badkis have been thoroughly loyal to the Afghan Government, and on several occasions large bodies of Jamshedi horsemen have helped the Afghan rulers of Herat. The Jamshedis have many horsemen, and their cavalry is considered very good, and notably helped Amir Sher Aly Khan. The next Aimak tribe to which I will refer is the Firuz Kuhi. I met some indi viduals of this tribe at Mohsinabad. They formerly extended up tho Murghab as far as Panj Deh and Maruchak, but both these places have been occupied by a branch of the Saruk Turkomans dependent on Afghanistan. When the Saruks were driven out of the country on the lower course of the Murghab by the Tekeh about 1855, a portion of them took refuge in Afghan territory, and occupied the most northern portion of the Firuz Kuhi countty, which was not then habitable by anybody but Turkomans. The Firuz Kuhis now occupy the mountain country from near Kala Nao almost to Maimana. The present Chief of the Firuz Kuhi tribe is Bahram Khan. Kadis or Gadis, is the chief seat of the tribe, Bahram Khan himself is the Chief of this portion of the country, as well as of the whole tribe. Chakcharan is another Firuz Kuhi place. The local Chief of Chakcharan is Muhammad Khan, and he has 1,000 families who.follow him. Bandar is the portion of the Firuz Kuhi country situated most to the northward, near Maimana. The local Chief of Bandar is named Ata Khan, and about 2,000 families of the Firuz Kuhi follow him. Fattahulla Beg, son of Sardar Muhammad Azim Khan Attalik, was formerly the Chief of the whole Firuz Kuhi tribe, but upon his refusing to come to Herat when summoned by Sirdar Abdul Kudus Khan, he was depri ved of the Chief taincy, and an Afghan force sent against him. After a little desultory fighting, he retired into the difficult country of Bandar, whence he raids on the portion of territory occupied by the followers of Bahram Khan. A portion of the tribe is still favourable to Fattahulla Beg, though he is a Barukzai, and not a real Firuz Kuhi. The Firuz Kuhis are of Persian origin, having come, it is said, from Firuz Kuh in the Alburz mountains not far from Mount Damavand. The next Aimak tribe are the Taymuni. Of this tribe I know much less than of the other Aimak tribes. I did not come into personal contact with any of the Taymuni. They are said to number about 17,000 families, and are the most numerous of all the Aimak tribes. Their chief place is Tiwara, near Gaur, south-east of Herat, where the Chief of the whole tribe, Anbia Khan, resides. A large number of them are also settled near Persi, which is also south-east of Herat. f I be Taymuni tribe were in great favour with Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan. Their Chief, Anbia Khan, having been at enmity with Ayub Khan, aided Abdul Kudus materially in his advance on Herat, and a large body of Taymuni accompanied him and helped to take pos session of Herat. Those men who accompanied Abdul Kudus were described to me by Heratis as being very uncivilized, and only a small number of them armed with guns. The Taymuni are said to be not of Persian but of Turanian origin. A larger proportion of this tribe have settled habitations than the othei Aimaks, and only a portion are nomads.tt“ obX h ' y » are a small tribe said 0il ^ C ^f was pu t to death by Ayub Khan for taking part SVTZti r.hS”Kh“ aS L, „«u«d.

Ihey are settle a Mnmhah to the Afghan frontier, but there is a Panj Deh, and along the cour ® e , * the S in(le nde nt Saruk settled at Yalutan and Governors of Herat, but the amount to be exacted very much depends on the state of Afghanistan. The Panj Deh Saruk have always acknowledged that they occupy 4fehan land's and are liable to pay revenue. The Governors of Herat may at times have been too weak to exact it, but while Abdul Kudus Khan was Governor+e sent a man with a few horsemen to Panj Deh to be Governor of the Aighan Saruk country, and this was done at the request of the Saruk. ., ,, - A Sardar Abdul Kudus Khan had proposed to send a considerable force under Akunzada Nizam-ud-Din, who was Governor of Ghunan so that the Afghans might have a strong position at Panj Deh, hut Akunzada Nizam-ud-Dm was accused of peculation in the administration of Ghurian, and was disgraced and deprived of his appointment under orders from Kabul. I will here mention what is at least, a curious coincidence. Akunzada Nizam-ud-Din, who was known to be friendly to the English, stopped a courier carrying a letter from the Russian Consular Agent at Mashad, Karim Beg, to the Russian Agent, Muhammad Sadyk, at Herat. Karim Beg then sent a message to Akundzada Nizam-ud-Din, that he should lose the governorship of Ghurian for this deed, though he had really only done his duty. Nizam-ud-Din was shortly afterwards removed from his governorship under orders from the Amir of Afghanistan, and I heard it stated that his unfriendliness to Russia was the cause of his disgrace. Sirdar Abdul Kudus Khan was very anxious that Akunzada Nizam-ud-Din should remain in power, and if he had not been removed a strong position would have been taken up by him, with a battalion of infantry and some guns, at Panj Deh, which, I think, would not have been satisfactory to the Russian Government, and was probably the real cause for his removal. The Saruk settled within the Afghan territory are said to number 7,000 tents or families, though I believe this is a high estimate. The Panj Deh Saruk are quite as much given to raiding in Persia as their Tekeh neighbours. They are not of so purely Turanian a type of face as the more northern tribe, and I could nearly always tell a Saruk Turkoman when I saw one from a Tekeh. They are also, though brave men, in this point considered inferior to the Tekeh. At present, nearly all the raids on Persian territory made by Turkomans are made by the Saruk. The Tekeh now seldom raid, and it is important that the Afghan Government should keep their Saruk subjects in order and prevent these incursions. Near Ghurian, in Afghanistan, and also near Turbat Shaik Jarai, in Persia, a number of people are settled, called Mervis. Some of these people also reside in the town of Mashad. They can be recognized at a glance as very different from Persians or Aimaks. These people are refugees who fled from Merv when Bairam Aly Khan, the Kajar Chief, was killed and the town captured (1784) by Amir Masum of Bokhara. They are found scattered all over Central Asia, and I received a good deal of interesting information about Samarkand from a Mervi of that place, whom I met in Mashad. In the Ghurian and Sabzawar district there are nomads of the Alizai and Nurzai tribes, who are not Aimaks. I had nothing to do with these people, but they are very much disliked by the Persians, who accuse them of carrying off sheep from the Persian bo*dei. Just before I reached Khaf, a flock of sheep was carried off, belonging to the Karai tribe of Rushkar, not very far from Khaf, and the Persians retaliated, but this was an affair of very small importance, and is of almost constant occurrence.Chapter VII. Journey to Mashad, and account of the Daragez and Kalat Nadiri Ataks, and of the claim advanced by Russia to that part of the country. Having received orders from Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to return to that place, as my presence was no longer required on the frontier, I left Rui Khaf on the 7th August and marched to Nasrabad, 25 miles over the same road as that by which I had travelled on my journey from Tehran. Nasrabad is a strongly fortified village, and is occupied at present by Dervish Aly Khan Timuri, late Governor of the Khaf district, who has been deprived of his appointment and succeeded by his brother Lutf Aly Khan, who was formerly at Nasrabad. This is merely an intrigue of the Mustashar- ul-Mulk, the Wuzir of Khurasan, to extract money. Dervish Aly Khan has been promised that he will be reinstated in the governorship of the Khaf district, after a few months, on payment of 2,000 tomans (a toman is worth Is. 6^.). Dervish Aly Khan received me with his usual cordiality; I had presented him with a good double- barrelled breech-loading gun and a breech-loading revolver. The two chiefs that I liked best of those that 1 met on this frontier were Dervish Aly Khan Timuri and Yusuf-Khan, the Hazara Chief at Mohsinabad. Both these men did everything in their power to help me, and were most cordial. From Nasrabad I marched as far as Rushkar, 14 miles along the same road as that by which I had travelled on my way from Tehran to Khaf. At Rushkar, which is in the Turbat Hidari district, I turned off the road 1 had formerly travelled, and went along the Turbat Hidari road as far as Sangun, distant 16 miles from Rushkar. Sangun is a very large village, strongly fortified, and almost to be called a town. From here there is a direct road to Mashad, but it is a very bad one, crossing two ranges of mountains. There is also another road, via Kalaminar, which is, I understand, also bad; but I preferred the bad road via Zawa, as, so far as I know, it had not been travelled by any European before. I rode over the next day from Sangun to within four miles of Turbat Hidari, whence I could see that town, so as to connect my present survey with that I had made two years before. I was very much interested in the Karai, or Kara Tartars, who are very numerous in the Turbat Hidari district, as there seems every probability that they are descen dants of the old Tartar tribe of Karait, whose Chief, Ung Khan, is believed to have been the original person referred to in mediaeval histories as Prester John. There is no doubt that the Karait tribe of Tartars were largely Christian, and several princesses of the Karait tribe married Mongol princes. The wife of Hulaku Khan, the great Mongol Viceroy of Persia, Dukhuz Khatun, was a Christian, and is believed to have been of the Karait tribe. It would be most interesting to trace back the history of these Karai, but merely marching through the country inhabited by them, I was not able to do so. During the one day I was in Sangun, however, I rode over to see Hadji Mahdi Kuli Khan, the only living son of Isah Khan Karai, I found him a fine old man, said to be 90 years of age. Isah Khan was the Karai Chief who built the town of Turbat Hidari. The family of Isah Khan have no power now, the policy of the Persian Government having been to break up the tribal cohesion of the different Turk or Tartar tribes, and to appoint governors from Tehran. Though the tribal cohesion of the Karais has been broken up, it would be quite possible to restore it. The Karai tribe are said to be brave, and furnish two battalions, one from Turbat Hidari, and the other from Turshiz, to the Persian army. Mahdi Kuli Khan gave me some interesting information about the history of the Karai; he told me that they had formerly inhabited the same country and were at first lords over the Mongols, and that a great battle had taken place between the Karai and the Mongols in the time of Chengis Khan, in which the Karai were defeated by Chengis, who moved them from their native pastures to the country near Tabriz and Roum. He said also that Amir Timur found the Karai settled in the west, and wished to transfer them back to the land from which they had or iginally come in Turkistan, and that he had the whole tribe collected with all their flocks and herds and driven back towards Turkistan. They were very unwilling to go, and when they reached the neighbourhood of Damghan they had broken out into revolt, and resisted the troops of Amir Timur who were driving them eastward. They had been defeated, and a large number of them slain, and the remainder had fled in various directions. The portion to which Isah Khan s ancestors belonged had fled into Fars, the country about Shiraz, but having heard that a considerable portion of the tribe who had been captured by the troops of Amir 8062 .

At six miles, after leaving Zawa a range of mountains is entered. This has no connection with the range of Bakharz, but runs from nel Ferimun to Turbat Hidari. The pass by which I crossed these mour.t.uns is known as Dinah KishtPukhta, or “ the pass of the burnt bricks. In the pass there k a ruined caravanserai, partly built of burnt brick, though part of it is of stone and this burnt brick caravanserai gives its name to the pass. i he road nses steadily until at 17 miles after leaving Zawa, the crest of the pass is reached the height ol the crest beinff 6,400 feet above sea level. The bills around rose quite 1,500 feet higher so that the highest peaks in this range must be at least 8,000 feet high. There was plenty of grass about, and it was quite cold. There were a few juniper and other trees and plenty of water. From the crest of the pass the road rapidly descended to the village of Nisur Gorlasi, or Nisur of the Gorlas tribe, which was reached after a long march of 34 miles from any starting point at Sangun. This pass is quite impracticable for any thing but mountain guns. From Nisur Gorlasi I was able to see and take the bearings of Kala Shazda, the village I had passed two years before, on the road from Turbat Hidari to Mashad. In the morning T had interviews with several Mongols of the Gorlas tribe, who still spoke Mongol. They said there were only two or three of them left who spoke Mongol fluently, but there were about 20 families who spoke it more or less. I took down a few names of common things to compare it with Turki, and found them generally different. I am quite ignorant of Mongol, and would like to show these words to some Mongol scholar. I could only tell that what they spoke was neither Turki, Persian, nor Afghan. They said they belonged to Chingiz Khan’s own tribe. They intermarried very much among themselves, and had preserved their Turanian features in a very marked manner. The rest of the villagers were Karai, and I could at once distinguish the Mongols from the Tartar Karais. I marched 14 miles the next day to the village of Badwund. At this village there was a very large and rich expanse of pasture, and the village, though a small one, has many cattle and horses. The road from Nisur to Badwund was over a plain, skirting the mountains I had crossed the previous day. The headman of the village, who mistook me for a Russian, came up and was most profuse in his thanks to the Russians for havinp* rescued them from the dreaded TnrkntYian T^T*nnfi inmntMr T -Pj-knY-krl but still were civil. On the 15th August I marched from Badwund to Sangbast, leaving the village of Ferimun some way to the right, and struck the regular Mashad and Herat road at bangbast. On this day’s iournev there was an alarm of Turkomans anrt were rather scar &lt; „ + . , .1 Vi * MJuugnt H uesi to rule up to them, whether they were furkomans or not, as I felt that, even if they were urkomans and I was carried off toMerv, I would meet with every civility from several people whom I knew there, and would be released after a few days, as soon as they knew uho 1 was. It, however, proved a false alarm. I was not far from Ferimnrf I rode into Mashad * Char ' eS MaCgreg0r WaS attacked b y Turkomans. The next day ■ “i-» **—- luky Khurasan, whom I had met on mv nrevious visit to a . vxeneial ol a «. y . k,;,, p- ,«, MraTgrtaSAsrx: sssmandant of cavalry at Mashad, called upon me, and I returned his visit. I also made acquaintance with Hashim Mirza Mazin-ud-Dowlah. I found the change to Mashad very pleasant, meeting civilized Persians, after the very wild people amongst whom I had been living. It was very amusing when I met Aimaks in the town of Mashad, and especially Timuris, to see how they at once saluted, and came up and spoke to me, evidently looking upon me as a friend; and I must say that I like the Aimaks better than either the Persians or Afghans. They have the free and independent manner of the Afghans without their swagger and boasting. I had previously sent despatches from Khaf, through Afghanistan, to the Foreign Secretary in India. They were forwarded by Mirza Tuky Khan, the British Agent at Herat, to Quetta to the British authorities at that place. The post of the Afghan Government is forwarded weekly from Herat to Kandahar, and stamps are used, as in more civilized countries. Mirza Tuky Khan had, however, a fortnightly post of his own, by which my letters were forwarded to Quetta. I continued to forward letters to India in this manner during my stay in Mashad. Soon after my arrival in Mashad, I received a telegram from Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, directing me to remain at Mashad pending further orders. I will here speak of the Ataks of Daragez and Kalat Nadari, about which I repeatedly wrote in my letters from Persia. Atak means ‘‘skirt,” and these portions of the country are called Atak as being the skirt of the mountains. They are a portion of the plain country still belonging to Persia, lying at the foot of the mountain ranges of Daragez and Kalat Nadari. I stayed for some days at Lutfabad, or Babajik, with Syud Aly Khan, the Persian Governor of the Daragez Atak, on my previous journey. Soon after the Russians occupied Askabad, Begler-Begi Muhammad Aly Khan, the Persian Governor of Daragez, was removed, and his brother, Alayar Khan, appointed Governor. Alayar Khan had been in disgrace at Tehran for some years, but as Muhammad Aly Khan was unable to pay up the large sums demanded from him by the Governor General of Khurasan, and also unable to send the necessary presents to Tehran, his elder brother, who had been in disgrace, was sent to replace him, and Muhammad Aly Khan was brought as a prisoner to Mashad. Syud Aly Khan, another brother, who was the Deputy Governor of the Daragez Atak, and knew he could expect no favour from Alayar Khan, fled to the Russians at Askabad, and was most useful to them. There was, I understand, an idea of appointing him Governor for the Russians of any portions of the Daragez Atak which they could obtain. Syud Aly Khan is, I think, an able man, and the Persian Government were very anxious to get him back. The Russians at last persuaded him, at the request of the Persians, to return to Mashad, but he only came on the condition made for him by the Russians that he should receive a pension of 500 tomans per annum from the Persian Government. He is now at Mashad, and is, of course, very pro-Russian. He is, no doubt, quite as useful to them in ad vancing their cause in Mashad as he was while in Askabad in giving them good information about frontier politics. 1 will briefly sketch the history of the two Ataks. The right of Persia to both Ataks cannot be disputed in the least, and has never until now been questioned. She has kept a stronger and more permanent hold on the northern, or Daragez Atak, than on the southern one. The last king who ruled Persia in its full extent, Nadir Shah, was bom in Daragez, close to the town of Muhammadabad, and one of his earliest exploits was the capture of Abiverd. After the death of Nadir Shah, Persia became a prey to contending factions, and the central Government was unable for some time to rule its outlying provinces. The Chiefs of Bujnurd, of Kuchan, of Daragez, of Kalat Nadari, of Turbat Hidari, of Turshiz, and of Tabbas, and the Amir of Kaian, in fact, the Chiefs of the greater part of Khorasan, became more or less independent, though they always acknowledged themselves as Persian feudatories; but all those Chiefs were reduced to thorough obedience, some sooner, some later, the very last of them more than 50 years ago, when, in 1832, Sarakhs and Kuchan, the very last to be reduced to obedience, were captured by the army of the Crown Prince, Abbas Mirza, the grand father of the present Shah. The Chiefs of Daragez, even in the most troublous times, never lost their hold over the Atak of Daragez, and Lutfabad was built and garrisoned and held by the Begler Begis of Daragez, more than a hundred yeais ago; and since 1832 Persian garrisons have always been present in the Daragez Atak. I he Begler Begis of Daragez, though always taken from the same family, are appointed from Tehran, and are often changed. They are Turks, like the Kajars themselves, and originally came, about 200 years ago from near Karshi in the Bokhara country, and settled at Chapushii, in Daragez, where one of the brothers of the Governor now^ i fi. mini HI JlliUll.lUlllim.lU!-)UU.Bg ;m uig|^IILIUI J UWWH4lil^UlllUIJ*«^« J » IUIllllIiaallg 56 i , 7a The family was in high favour with Nadir Shah, who, being himself of^Daragrasfemployed them in high politions.. LutfAlyKhan, the great grandfather of the present Governor, threw in his lot with the Kajar, and was a favourite with Lha Muhammad Khan, the first of the Kajar kings. It was this chief who built the fort at Lutfabad, since which time, though the country has often been harried by Turkomans, the Persian hold has never relaxed. The Governors of Daragez have been allowed to collect and keep the revenue for the payment of 400 cavalry, which thev are bound to maintain for the service of the Shah. Pesides this, they have con stantly to send large gifts to both Tehran and Mashad. The revenue collected is accounted for to the Persian Government, and then allowed as pay for the cavalry quartered in Daragez. As it was not considered that the pay of 400 cavalry and the other expenses of Government, pay of the Governor, &amp;c., could be met by the revenue collected in Daragez, a further sum of 1,500 tomans a year was credited by the central Government to the Governor of Daragez for the payment of the troops quartered there ; but I need hardly remark that none of this money ever reached the Governor’s hands' being intercepted by the authorities at Mashad or somewhere else. I heard, however, that when Alayar Khan returned, a regular settlement would be made, and only the sum required for the payment of the regiment of cavalry of Daragez would be allowed, and instead of the system of presents a regular sum would be credited by the Governor of Daragez to the treasury at Mashad, but 1 am not aware if this arrange ment has been carried out. As it was found very difficult for a Persian or Kurd population to exist in the more exposed villages of the Atak, the Daragez Chief encouraged Turkomans of various tribes to settle in the more exposed villages, but these Turkomans paid revenue to the Persian Governor of Daragez in the same way as the Persian villages; a tenth of the produce was regularly paid. The Turkomans settled in the more exposed villages of Daragez, such as Makdum, Mehni, Hissar, Kas- sowli Khusru, &amp;c., are of various Turkoman tribes, Tekeb, Alieli, &amp;c. The Alieli originally came from near Andkhui, in Afghan territory, and were settled in Abiverd, or Baverd, as the Turkomans pronounce the word. After some years’ residence they quarrelled with the Governor of Daragez, and went off to Khiva. After the capture of Khiva by the Russians, they returned and were settled at Kahka, which belongs to the Kalat Nadari Atak. They are the most numerous of any one tribe settled in the Ataks, and are, I am informed, now claimed as Russian subjects. I was told by several people not only that the whole of the villages inhabited by Turkomans had been informed by Colonel Aminoff, the late chief of the staff at Askabad, that they were Russian subjects, but that Syud Nasir, the Alieli Chief of Kahka, had been acknow ledged as a sort of governor tor the Russians of all villages inhabited by Suni Muham madans. Last September, when 1 was in Mashad, surveying parties, accompanied by Cossacks, of whom there were no less than four wandering about, some as far down as Chacha, were tellmg the people not to pay revenue to Persia, and these people, accus tomed as they were to pay a tenth to the Persian Government, did not like to remove their gram heaps until the tax had been collected, and they were waiting, leaving their grain lying in the fields, to see whether they had to pay their revenu^ as they had usually done to Persia, or whether it would be taken by the Russians • but the Russians said, “You need pay no taxes at all, and we will buy all the grain you can - spare for the use. of our troops.” I need not say that paying no taxes was mos pleasant ‘.these Turkoinaiis, ,nd that tb.

When Mr. Lessar made his journey as far to the southward as Khaf, he was accompanied by 22 horsemen, who were chiefly Alieli Turkomans, though their commander was Ana Galdi, a Tekeh, and these men, though really Persian subjects, carried Russian breech loading rifles. If it is true, and there seems little reason to doubt it, that Russia claims all the villages upon this border which are inhabited by Suni Muhammadans, it is a very serious matter, as this claim might be extended not only to the two Ataks, which are largely, though by no means entirely, inhabited by Sunis, but to the Salor Turkomans who have lately settled at Zurabad to the south of Sarakhs. The Hazaras of Mohsinabad and the Timuris of Khaf are also Sunis, and if this claim to consider the Suni Muhammadans of the Persian border as rightfully belonging to Russia be admitted, there is nothing to prevent Russia claiming a narrow belt of territory along the Persian border not only to the latitude of Herat, but far to the southward. If the claim to the allegiance of Suni Muhammadans be confined to those who are of Turkoman race, which it probably is at present, even that would advance the Russian frontier as far as Nilabad, a settlement of the Salor Turkomans, within 12 miles of Shaikh Jami, and within three easy marches of the Afghan border-fort of Kusan. There seems to be no doubt that Russia does claim all Turkomans living within the Persian border as Russian subjects. I have heard this from many Persians from Daragez, and some Turkomans said nearly the same thing. In a conversation I had with a Russian Colonel of Cossacks, on my journey from Krasnovodsk to Baku, he plainly said that if the water was cut off from the Turkomans living in the Ataks of Daragez and Kalat Nadari, Cossacks would be sent to force the Persians to supply water. By the treaty with Russia signed last March, Persia is bound not to interfere with the water supply of the villages in the Akhal Tekeh country, but that is plainly laid down by the treaty as ending at Babadurmaz, and Russia can have no possible right to interfere in the Ataks. The Persians, finding that the Alieli and Tekeh settled on the lower course of the streams, running down from Daragez and Kalat Nadari, have refused to pay revenue to Persia, prefer to use the water supply which they have to irrigate the fields of their revenue-paying subjects. This claim of the Alieli and other Turkomans of the border villages of the Atak to be supplied with water without paying for it, which they have always previously done, is quite as untenable as would be the contention of a London householder that he must be sup plied with water by a water company without paying for it. I see that Mr. Lessar also speaks in his published letters in the same way as my Cossack friend about this water question. The Shah does not object to Russia occupying the Ataks, and I cannot think that any serious objection will be made by the Persians to the occupation of the fort of Sarakhs by Russia. It will be surrendered whenever they want it, without much dif ficulty, a small money indemnity being probably demanded, or else a promise will be made that Persia shall be indemnified by the acquisition of territory elsewhere. Sarakhs and the Ataks are of no use to Persia, though they might be of great use to Russia, and were only held because it was necessary to prevent Turkomans obtaining a pied-a-terre on the Tejend from which to raid into Persia. The hold of Persia on the Atak of Kalat Nadari was not so strong and permanent as that on the northern Atak, partly because the country was even more exposed to Turkoman inroads than the Atak of Daragez, and partly because the chiefs of Kalat Nadari were not as strong as the Begler Begis of Daragez. Whenever Sultan Murad Mirza Hissam-i-Sultaneh was the Governor General of Khurasan, the Kalat Nadari Atak was always held and regularly paid revenue, but, at times, the Persians lost their hold on this Atak. It was, however, constantly re-asserted, and for the last few years the tax of a tenth has regularly been paid, until the people were warned by the Russians not to pay it. Chapter VIII. State of Affairs in the Merv country. The state of affairs in the Merv country has altered considerably in the two years that have elapsed since Russia took possession of Askabad, and I had been previously on this frontier. Things are now much more favourable for an annexation of that country by Russia than they were two years before. Several of the chiefs then in power have either died or been superseded. Amaniaz Khan, of the Suchmuz clan, who was very powerful, and represented the Otamish or combined clans of Suchmuz and Bukshi, died and has been succeededf 58 ty a relative called Mayly Khan as representative of the combined clans of Suchmuz and Bukshi. Baba Khan, the son ot Kausniu - Teiend, and his place as chief Merv, has been deprived of power “ nd h ^ 9 f° Sardar Bal a K han has joined an uncle of the Beg cl|&gt;n has been taken by ^ Kaus hid Khan. Khoju Kuli Khan of his called Khoja h * , cultivating largely near Chungul on the is a great friend of &gt; d B b KliaI) h S ave i )0t |, visited Askabad and lower Tejend. , Ka ™ ^ K.d ^rdar received a Russian order and a purple robe, but Kala Kaushid Khan. Baba Khan seems to I f fhrnun in his lot entirely with the Russians, but he has, at present, not much 0 ^ The last I heard of Baba Khan was that, at the beginning of September, he P T of vlrl cLch* accompanied by a party of Russian surveyors and Cossacks. I have not heard that Mayly Khan visited Askabad. Of the Toktamiah or combined clans of Wakil and Beg, there seems at present to be no paramount chief, Kara Kill being the chief of the Beg division only, and living at Kala KaushM Khan^ and Mukdum Kuli Khan, with his brother, Muhammad Yusuf Bn, are chiefs of the Wakil. Mukdum Kuli Khan was the chief spirit of the defence of Geok lepe He has never proceeded to Askabad, though many overtures have been made to him to do so I n case of war, Mukdum Kuli Khan would probably, by his energy, and the prestige he gamed while defending, though unsuccessfully, the Akhal country against the Russians, succeed in being elected chief of the Toktamish, or combined clans of Beg and Wakil. Merv was visited by two Russian merchants and Lieutenant Alikanoff last April, as reported by me at the time, but they were not allowed to remain, and had to leave after a very few days’ stay, leaving their goods unsold in charge of a Turkoman chief. Mr. Lessar also visited Merv last September, and proceeded from there to Khiva, but of this journey I know little, as I was returning to Tehran at the time of his visit, and I do not think much will be done by Europeans in the Merv country. Even Lieutenant Maksud Alikhanoff, who is a Mussulman, was not allowed to make any stay there. An attempt was made of a much more serious character last August and September to increase the Russian power in the Merv country. Muhammad Yusuf Bii, a Khivan noble, the grandson of Muhammad Niaz Bii, who was Governor of the Merv country, when it belonged to Khiva some forty-five years ago, was sent down by the Khan of Khiva, to persuade the Tekeh Turkomans of Merv to declare themselves Khivan subjects and to accept him as Governor. He was accom panied by about 24 servants and followers, and was entertained at Kala Kaushid Khan by Kara Kul, Sardar, the Chief of the Beg clan. Kara Kul, Sardar, promised to call a meeting of all the tribes, and to propose at the general assembly that the Merv Tekeh should declare themselves Khivan subjects, and accept Muhammad Yusuf Bii as Governor of the country on the part of the Khan of Khiva, and he advised Muhammad Yusuf Bii to get ready a hundred dresses of honour to present to the chief men of the assembly. Muhammad Yusuf Bii, however, answered that at present he had no robes of honour, and under these circumstances it seemed very doubtful when I left Mashad if the assembly would be held. The Tekeh would probably not care to waste their time to go to a meeting where nothing was to be obtained. Two men of Kara Kul’s own tribe, to whom I was speaking in Mashad, said to me, “As “ long as Muhammad Yusuf Bii gives us presents we will accept him as Governor • “ when he ceases to do that we will not.” No doubt the Merv Tekeh will not surl render to Russia until some force is brought to bear upon them, but a party is certainly growing up in the Merv country not unfavourable to annexation by Russia and the same resistance would not be made to a Russian advance which would have been same resistance would not be made to a Russian advance which would have been made two years ago. The Russian party is likely to increase in numbers and im portance as time wears on. A rich Tekeh merchant with whom I spoke said to me on my asking him whether he would like to be a Russian subject, “ What care T whn«A “ subject I am, so long as I can carry on my trade without evidently the trading classes, if no other, would greatly gain 1 and it, is now becoming known among them that Russia^does not interfere with their yj'fy’V T1 \ e / “f steal importance of Merv has, I think, been very rnneh over- estimated, and I believe we nnsht nermit Russia tn nnnmw ^ L OJTU’IYC OClUX tu me, Oil J11VC ue 51 lluss,an supject, “What care I whose subject I am so long as I can carry on my trade without being plundered?” and evidently the trading classes, if no other, would greatly gain by annexation to Russia, i V fr-C ncicvsrf-k W 4. * _ .4- • -i . estimated, and I believe we might permit Russia to’occupy Merv without makin^anv objection. It is not on the road to India, and is only important to R„«i a w ” ! y an advance to Herat by Sarakhs, the Turkomans nnght attack them in flanlf fri'mf’tl' Merv districts, but this is very imurohahlp as thp 'TuvL- i , lorn the to supply large bodies of boS i^r ^ ^ Kn Usbeg Chief of Maimana, sent to the Turkomans to hire Lhen.en^gainst'L Afghan^ # 1 ' fand, had payment been certain, no doubt he would have been supplied with any number he could have paid for. Ayub Khan also hired Turkoman horsemen, and Russia could at any moment hire a considerable body of Turkoman horsemen if they were well paid. As far as I am aware, only about 120 Turkoman horse are at present in the Russian service, being kept up, for the defence of Gawars and other posts, as a sort of cavalry militia. In my later reports from Khaf and in those sent from Mashad, I spoke a great deal of Maimana. Maimana has been, since the time of Amir Dost Muhammad Khan, a dependency of Afghanistan. It is the fashion to say that it has 20,000 families, which would represent a population of eighty or ninety thousand, but I believe this to be an ex aggeration. The greater part of the population of Maimana consists of Usbeg Turks. Dilawar Khan, the present Chief of Maimana, was called upon to acknowledge Amir Abdur Rahman Khan as the Amir of Afghanistan, and to forward the usual revenue and presents paid by the Walis of Maimana to the Afghan Government, and an Afghan force under Sardar Ishak Khan marched from Mazar-i-Sherif to Sar-i-Pul, and sent a messenger to Dilawar Khan. Dilawar Khan replied that he was quite ready to acknowledge himself an Afghan subject, and to pay the usual tribute annually, as had previously been done, and he sent 5,000 tengis (a tengi is worth about Qd.), and several good horses for Amir Abdul Rahman Khan, saying that, though he was quite ready to acknowledge himself an Afghan subject, he would not receive Afghan troops in his country, as his people would not permit him to do so. The Afghan troops, when previously quartered there, having so plundered the country that the people would not stand it, but if the Afghan army did not occupy the place the tribute should regularly be sent. Dilawar Khan prepared for war in case the Afghans entered Maimana. He made every effort to get together munitions of war. He collected the whole fighting strength of the Maimana country, but the number collected is said not to exceed 8,000 fighting men and six guns. This seems to be the utmost number of fighting men that Maimana can supply, and, as in these countries almost every grown up male is a fighting man, I cannot think the population is so large as it is said to be. Dilawar Khan sent away all the women and children, including his own family, to a stronghold in the mountains, about 80 miles off, accompanied by a sufficient escort. If we suppose that the escort that accompanied the women and children consisted of 1,000 men (which seems to me even more than is probable), it would show that the utmost force that could be collected by the Wall of Maimana, even in a cause that is popular and in which every one was ready to join, does not, in all, amount to more than 9,000 men. In these lands, one in five of the population may be looked upon as fighting men. This would only give forty-five or fifty thousand as the population of Maimana. Dilawar Khan sent off a messenger with a letter to the Russian Government, addressed to Karim Beg, the Russian Consular Agent at Mashad. The horseman who brought the letter was well entertained by the Russian Agent, and given an allowance of three krans (worth about '2s. 3d.) a day, to feed himself and his horse. The letter was forwarded on to the Russian Minister at Tehran. An answer was returned after a short time, and the horseman left for Maimana with it. I heard, on what I believe to be pretty good authority, the general purport of the letter carried back by the horseman. It was to the effect that the Wall of Maimana need not be alarmed, as the Afghan troops would not enter Maimana. If this is true, and there seemed to be good ground for believing it to be so, the Russian Government must have some private understanding with Amir Abdur Rahman Khan as to Maimana. It will be curious to see whether the promise of the Russian Minister will be kept or not, Maimana has no connection with Bokhara, as was shown by the fact that the Wali of Maimana addressed his petition for help, not to the Russian Resident in Bokhara, but to the Russian Consular Agent at Mashad, who looks after Afghan affairs. Sirdar Ishak Khan, Governor of Afghan-Turkistan, had with him three weak regi ments of infantry, one of cavalry, and six guns, besides about 400 irregular cavalry, at Sar-i-Pul. Pie was too weak to attack Maimana, when held by 8,000 Usbegs with six guns. Dilawar Khan also sent to hire Turkoman cavalry in the Merv country, as I previously mentioned, but the answer of the Turkomans had not arrived when I Irft the frontier. An insulting message was after a time sent by Dilawar Khan to Sardar Ishak Khan, defying him, this was caused by Dilawar Khan finding out how weak was the force of Afghan troops which had been sent against him. 1 believe the promise contained in the letter sent by Karim Beg, the Russian Agent at Mashad, to the Wali of Maimana has been fultilled, and that the Afghan troops have returned to their usual quarters at Mazar-i-Sherif.1 • * marie to me by a British subject, a merchant in Mashad, of Great comjdamt was macle * ^ fr(irn Mashad to Bokhara, in consequence the interruption ofthe hade in _g g ^ RussianS) or their importation being of the sudden levy of piobil S' tal y k at Mashad w i t h a Samarkand mnllah of forbidden altogether I also h inhabitants of Merv who were carried off about the race called Mervis^ that is of the ■'aut^^ ^ Bokhara This man t ld 100 years a^., when Merv wa^ ^ u y erl f orb idden, and could not be imported at me that all English cottoi g . . t Particular sort of white muslin which is an.

No opium is allowed to be imported into San Turkistan, all found being destroyed on the spot. I am told the trade from itussiai Q vprv laro-e has greatly declined in consequence of these ex- cessiv^duties and English piece goods, which used to be forwarded from Mashad, are now quiteshutTut of the Jarket. Specimens of the English cotton goods formerly imported hut now prohibited, have been forwarded to Russia for the piuposes of being imitated in the Russian cotton mills. The Samarkand mollah gave me on the whole a very favourable account of Russian rule in Samarcand; he said the peasants paid a tax of four tengis from a jarib of land. On the whole the agricultural classes were better off under the Russian rule than under the Mussulman one, which I thought was a very astonishing acknowledgment from a bigoted Muhammadan priest. He said heavier taxes were levied from the townspeople, who under Mussulman rule paid nothing beyond the zakat, or commercial dues of two and a half per cent., levied on all goods. I think he must have forgotten or overlooked the multitude of exactions which are illegally levied by the rulers in all Muhammadan countries. The mollah said he had done the distance from Charjui to Kala Kaushid Khan in five marches, and called it 44 farsakhs. Re told me that the Governor of Samarkand, when he left, about three months previously to my seeing him in September, was named Arandari. I cannot think what Russian name this can mean, but these people always make a mess of all European names; Russian names are almost worse for them than English ones. The mollah said Arandari was a Mussulman, a Nogi Tartar by race, and that he had visited the Amir of Bokhara, and had gone both to Charjui and Karshi. He had been received with great honour by the Amir of Bokhara, who had given him presents of various sorts, to the value of three lacs of tengis. No doubt this was a gross exaggera tion. He said that General Ivanoff had been in Samarkand and had visited Bokhara, where he spent three months, and had afterwards gone to Karshi and finally to Khokand. He said that the garrison of Samarkand at the time he left was 4,000 men. Upon my remarking that I thought this was an exaggeration, he said “ No; the butcher who “ supplies the rations is a friend of mine, and I know that 4,000 rations of a pound “ each of beef are supplied/’ He said he had heard that a considerable expedition had been sent against the Dungans, though he did not know exactly who the Duncans were, and 1 had to explain to him. While I was in Mashad I saw a good deal of Sirdar Hashim Khan, the Afghan Sardar who was in Kabul with General Roberts, and who it was at one time proposed should be Amir. He married the daughter of Amir Sher Aly Khan, and the favourite wife of the Amir, as well as his young son, Abdur Rahman* Jan, are now living with Hashim Khan. Sardar Hashim Khan very favourably impressed me. I had met has father in India previously. He complained bitterly of not being repaid the large sum of money which he had lent General Roberts for the use of the British troops while in Kabul. He had purchased a Persian village in the neighbourhood of Mashad and intended to reside there. He had moved from Turbat Hidari to Mashad at the remw of the British Agent, Mirza Abbas Khan, C.I.E. 1 I saw a great deal of Sardar Abdul Wahab Khan, the ablest of the sons of Sardnr Mr Alzul Khan who is the son of Purdil Khan. Abdul Wahab Khan was Gov o of Herat when Ayub Khan defeated us at Maiwand. I wrote an exhaustive remu t a f the request of Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, on the conduct of Sardar Mir Afzul Khan during the troubles in Afghanistan. 1 Alzul r ^ was in J Ia8ha . d &gt; M «sa Jan, the young son of Amir Yakub Khan was there I would bring to the notice of Government that it seems to me highly desirable that Musa Jan should join his father in India, as he is now about 13 or 14 years old andwill soon be of an age to be used as a catspaw by Russia or Persia, which is almost the same thing, for intrigues in Afghanistan. Ayub Khan, out of the handsome allowance that he draws in Tehran, has only sent a very moderate sum indeed to Musa Jan as his share, and the boy is badly off, and much disgusted with his treatment by Ayub Khan. I do not think there would be much difficulty, if a fair pension is promised him, in persuading him to join his father in India, and a great object would be gained if he was removed from Persia. Chapter IX. Journey from Mashad to Tehran. On the 28th August I received a telegraphic despatch from Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, to say it was not necessary for me to remain any longer in Mashad. He also asked me to submit the report above alluded to about Sardar Mir Afzul Khan. I did this, and left Mashad on the 2nd September, marching by the mountain road to Nishapur. I had on my previous journey marched by Sherifabad to Nishapur, which is a more level road. That which I was now taking, however, though very steep and mountainous, is a little shorter. The first day I marched to Turgoveh, distant 15 miles from Mashad. From Turgoveh to the next village, Jaghark, the whole country is one mass of orchards, producing the most delicious fruit. Peaches, apricots, nectarines, and fine large plums were abundant, in fact, magnificent peaches could be purchased at about six for a penny, and common fruit had hardly any appreciable value. Near Turgoveh there is an abandoned gold mine, which has been extensively worked in very ancient times. Mr. Hadkinson, an English engineer, has been sent by the Shah to report upon these mines, and I met him at Tehran just starting for them. I did not visit them myself. From Turgoveh the road is very bad indeed, and leads by the bed of a small stream past the village of Jaghark. At 16 miles from Turgoveh it reaches a small caravanserai, called Robat Mehr Aly. The ascent which up to this point has been gradual now becomes steep, and at 21 miles from our starting place the crest of the pass is reached. I unfortunately did not take its height, as I usually do, but I believe Major Napier, who travelled this road, did so, and he gives it in his map as 9,300 feet. On a clear day, pilgrims coming from the westward first catch sight of the holy shrine of Imam Reza at Mashad from this point. From the crest of the pass the road descends very abruptly to the village of Deh Rud, almost hidden in orchards. At Deh Rud the mountains end, and the road for a few miles passes over slightly broken country, until the other road from Mashad to Nishapur is struck, a little to the west of Kadamgah, whence the road passes through a thickly inhabited country to Nishapur. At Nishapur there are the ruins of two cities besides the town. The first is the old town, destroyed by the Mongol armies. The Mongols took a peculiarly savage vengeance upon Nishapur. Their army having been repulsed from before the place, with the loss of its leader, a large force returned and captured the town. A most fearful massacre then took place, in which the daughter of Chingiz Khan, whose * husband had been killed during the first attempt to take the city, took an active part, and herself committed many atrocities. The ruins of a second Nishapur are also seen, before reaching that which is now occupied. I got a few ancient coins at Nishapur, but not many, as the people demanded extraordinarily high prices for them. Those I did procure were chiefly of the time of the Khalifs of Baghdad. Here I had the choice of two roads, either the post road, ordinarily used by travellers, or that a little to the north, which passes near the turquoise mines at the village of Maadan, and goes through the Jagatai Jouvain valley, meeting the post road at Shahrud. As I had traversed the post road on my former journey, I determined to use the other, especially, as far as I was aware, it had not been travelled in its entire length by any English traveller. Major the Honourable G. Napier had marched over a portion of it, but he came from Shahrud by the ordinary road, and after four marches, crossed over to the Jagatai Jouvain road. The distances by the two roads are very nearly the same, the post road being a little shorter. From Nishapur it is 29 miles to Maadan, the road passing over a level country until within a few miles of the latter place. I found an old friend, General Schindler, of the Persian service, in charge of the turquoise mines at Maadan. Pl. new arrange ment had been made about the management of these mines, which were formerly let to the neighbouring villagers, who paid a large sum annually to the Shah’s Govern ment as rent. Now, however, the whole of the turquoise mines had been taken direct from the Shah by the Mukbur-ud-Dowlah, the Minister of Telegraphs and Mines, at a 8062 . Q62 f f 90 000 tomans yearly (a toman is worth Is. 6d.), and General Schindler had rent of 20,000 tom y J \ , Mukbur-ud-Dowlah. The villagers did not like this been sent down to workjhej, )iy the chiefs 8 of the village by arrangernen a ■ , before General Schindler arrived they had filled in several of Te be'! nfin' .' ver eaTy^filit some of the mines, as 'the pillars which support the roof have'only to be cut through, and the m.ne falls m. Great expense will be hicurred in clearing the mines, which are very numerous, and cover a considerable extent of ground. I visited most of the mines, and went down two or three of them L company with General Schindler. The hills in which the turquoises are found are formed of silicious clay slate, intersected with porphyry veins. The greater number of turquoises are found in veins in the mountains, but the finest are got from what is called the khaki or dirt washed down from the mountains, and accumulated at their foot A shaft is*here sunk, and the earth is dug out and washed. Turquoises get their blue colour from being stained with copper, but a great many which have been stained with iron have a greenish tinge; these are of little value, and are only fit for sale to Arabs or Afghans. The very best turquoises are sent either to Moscow or Paris, where the best prices can be obtained for them. In England turquoises are not much valued, but in Paris I believe as much as 800/. has been paid for a good one. There are several other turquoise mines in Persia, notably one in the Turshiz district, near which I passed, but these are not so good as those found in the IVlaadan mines. Turquoises are also found in Egypt, Badakshan, and I believe also sometimes in the Carpathian mountains. The road I was now about to travel is some 25 miles to the north of the post road, and it is divided from it by the range of mountains generally called the Jagatai mountains. This is the road that would probably be followed by an army marching from Shahrud to Khurasan, as it passes over a much more fertile country than the ordinary road. It was formerly much used, but has been deserted for many years, in consequence of its being so much infested by Turkomans. Now that the Russians hold the Akhal country, however, it is comparatively safe, though still infested by Kurdish robbers. I had no escort, but felt that an Englishman would be quite safe. I marched from Maadan to Sultanabad, 20 miles, mostly over a level country. Sultanabad stands close to the Jagatai mountains. At this place I got a guide, and started next day for Kalata Arab. At four miles we passed through the village of Robat-i-Gez, after leaving which my guide, who had been declared by the chief man of the village to be the best possible guide, and one who knew the country well, said he had not been on the road before, and did not know anything about it. The country for 16 miles between Sultanabad and Husainabad is quite uninhabited, and the track we were following was so slightly marked, that the guide kept constantly losing it. I left him with the mules to find his own way, and hurried on towards Husainabad. A very great storm of hail and wind came on, and being alone, 1 had great difficulty in keeping the road. The wind blew with furious force in my face, and the hail and rain driven by the storm cut sharply, till at last I had to halt and turn my back to the • storm for half an hour, when it abated. I then hurried on, and at last managed Jo find the village of Husainabad, 20 miles from Sultanabad. The village is the first in the Jagatai Jouvain country. The place where the Deputy Governor of Jacntai J on vain lives is a small town called Jagatai. There is at present no town called Jou vain, thongh I passed a mound which might have been the site of a former village. The mound is called Jouvamak, which means little Jouvain. About two miles from “T^',^r,:rr^ of vrf iderable tow v he waiis and ^ in- A-i 1 ^ the Cltadel ai *e very marked, forming a circular mound at the neighbouring village of Ahmadabld for coins or relies^f arvTort WI “T'™ 8 r s :V“ M *.u' that Budagh Sultan lived here! but Ihev had notdea 7^ vi ! lage '' s ^ when he lived. They also told me tlvn 4 ^ ^ i W 10 ^ &gt;uda g h Sultan was, or quarters of the population of the place hadVeViifThr^' 1 ^^ 6 be6n qUile three man who was speaking to me and who had f'ormld!^ I jrevious year, the that most of the people I saw about had come fron'e!s'wherJX^n^^^TA'?deserted village. The plague had been very bad in this part of the world until a few months ago, and typhus fever of bad type is still raging in some villages a little to the northward. The people told me that a person attacked by the plague, and on whom the plague boil appeared, generally recovered, while those on whom it did not appear, seldom did so. A great murrain, which almost destroyed the whole of the cattle in Khurasan, was prevailing at the same time that the plague raged in this neighbourhood. It is curious that this visitation seems to have been confined to the villages along this line of road. I never heard of any case on the other road, only some 25 or 30 miles to the southward. At seven miles from Husainabad I passed the village of Kalata Arab. The whole of the country is very thickly inhabited, the villages succeeded one another at short intervals. The greater part of the population are Turks. There are also some Kurd villages, and some Baluchi nomads are occa sionally found encamped near them. Many of the Turks I met could not speak Persian. The Turks belonged to various tribes, the most numerous being called Kilitchi. Kilitch means sword in Turki. At 25 miles a very fine fort, called Ak-kala, far the strongest and best I had seen in Persia, is passed. It has been a large town, enclosed by thick walls, and a deep ditch, and contains the ruins of a brick-built mosque, very strongly and massively built, but without any pretensions to architectural beauty. The fort is in ruins, but the walls are so massive that they will last for a long time. This place was the stronghold of Sulyman Khan, g&gt;f the Kurd tribe of Zafaranlu; he revolted against the present Shah at the time* that the Salar, the son of the then Governor of Khurasan, revolted at Mashad. Ak Kala was taken without much resist- tance, and the whole of its inhabitants removed to other places. It has been a ruin ever since. The Kajar rule is very unpopular in Khurasan, so one would have expected that the revolt of the Salar would have met with more popular sympathy, but as a Khurasani said to me, the Salar was himself of Kajar race, and they did not want to substitute one Kajar for another, meaning that if the leader of the revolt above mentioned had been any one but a Kajar the result would have been different. At 27 miles I reached the village of Zurabad, a flourishing place, where I halted for the night. From Zurabad, the small town of Jagatai can be seen, where the Governor resides. The present Governor is Musa Khan Kajar. The Jagatai Jouvain district extends from Husainabad, where I had encamped the night before, to the Abrishmi river, which is the boundary of Khurasan to the westward. The district of Jagatai Jouvain is narrow, being bounded on the south by the Jagatai mountains, on the borders of which the town of Jagatai stands. On the north, Jagatai Jouvain is divided from Isfaryin by a low range of hills, for which I could obtain no name. The chief place of Isfaryin is called Mianabad, and is said to be about 20 miles north by east of the village of Zurabad, where I was now encamped. At 12 miles from Zurabad, the small village of Khusrushir is reached. There are the ruins of a fine brick mosque, and by its side a tall minar or pillar. Around the mosque are the ruins of a small town, but the remains are not extensive, and the place could not have been of much importance. It is curious to find the ruins of a fine mosque in what could only have been at the best a small town. There are the remains of Cufic writing on the walls of the mosque, but these are only quotations from the Koran. There is no date to show who built the mosque, but I should not consider it very ancient. At 22 miles from Zurabad, I halted at the flourishing village of Rachaman. The people are very much accus tomed here to meeting Europeans, so many Russians and Russian Armenians, who are quasi-Europeans, travel about this part of this country, purchasing provisions for the troops in the trans-Caspian province of Russia. The people all took me for a Russian, and, on my telling them that I was English, they expressed surprise, never having seen an Englishman before. The headman at Rachaman had a letter in Russian given him by some one, which he showed me, but I am unable to read Russian, and could not tell him its contents. I marched from Rachaman on the 15th September, the road still continuing over the same plain. The town of Jagatai was still in sight, it being situated halt way be tween Zurabad and Rachaman. After leaving Rachaman, many villages are passed, as this country is thickly inhabited. At 22 miles I halted at the village of Sharifabad, which is a poor place, the greater part of its inhabitants having deserted it in conse quence of the drying up of one of the underground canals which supplied it with water. Beyond Sharifabad, there is no cultivation. For the first two miles, there are a few nomad camps, and two deserted villages. The country is, however, not desert, there being plenty of bushes on which camels and sheep can graze. The road passes over the plain through which I have been travelling for several days, but the low range of,. u J- Fmivain wlain from the Isfaryin plain comes to an SZ f ' 10 “' w “‘' At'sT miles fnm^harifaba™a^rnt jjj e Har i Rud, which was built doubt it is of the same period ^XAIheyU ^ This caravanserai At 21 miles from Shanfabad aburnt biick caravam ^ ^ Hari R|uJ; which was huilt is exactly the same pattern as 6 A ‘ mir Timur g This caravanserai has no date or Iff i ^tlTZXJ'S Ln. d Thl 1 rUTo the mfdTbf Shl^ 'e made, foi it never h . _ } W rpneatedlv visiting: it himself. The rendered Mashad a fashionable plac^ from the r?”o^tcribt TMs^s and it has'evidently'been built by a Timuride king or prince. There have been three roads to Khurasan m use at various periods firstly! one from Bostan vid Jajarm and Kuchan to Tus the second the one I have been following, and the third the post road, first adopted by Shah Abbas. The ha ting places on theroad I have been following, were in ancient times probably Shanfabad, Khusrushir, Kuruzdeb, Astagna, and Robat-i-Gez. At several of these places there are ruins of caravanserais. Just beyond the caravanserai which I am now describing is the Abrishmi river, with the ruins of a bridge over it, and this bridge, as well as that over the same river on the more southern road, is called Pul Abrishmi, or the “ silken bridge. Tradition says that both were built by a silk merchant. The Kal Mura, or Abrishmi river, which forms the boundary of Khurasan, has at this season little water, but at certain seasons comes down in high flood. The water of the river is quite undrinkable, being far salter than sea water. There is, however, a marsh here, containing water, which, though very nasty, it is possible to drink. By sending to a spring about two miles off. I obtained same water that was only slightly brackish. Some nomads are generally encamped with flocks of sheep, in the neighbourhood of this river. I here saw a splendid specimen of the cross between a double-humped Bactrian, and the single humped Arabian, camel. The first generation of this cross is really a magnificent animal, and can carry an enormous load. » I had to bring provisions with me from Sharifabad, nothing except sheep being obtainable at Robat-i-Pul Abrishmi. The next day I crossed the Abrishmi river, which is joined a few miles above this point by two salt affluents, one of them from Jouvain and the other from Isfaryin. The road passes over a plain, and at 14 miles a cara vanserai is reached. It is called Robat-i-Nogumbad. There is, however, no water here, the reservoir having been permitted to fail into ruins. At 25 miles from Robat-i-Pul Abrishmi a number of small hamlets, collectively known as Kalata or “ the hamlets,” is reached. For the whole 47 miles from Sharifabad to Kalata, there are no per manent inhabitants, and no water except at the small marsh near Robat-i-Pul Abrishmi, where a few nomads were encamped. On the 18th September I marched to Mags, distant 26 miles. After leaving the group of hamlets where I had halted for the night, and which are named Kuhun, Bikeran Yunistan, Askarabad, and Kurdabad, the village of Riabad can be seen a long wav to the right. The country is quite bare and uninhabited until the eighteenth mile, when a considerable village called Ghilan is reached. After passing through Ghilan, the road continues over a plain for eight miles, when the flourishing village of Mags is reached. Mags has plenty of water and fine trees. Provisions are, however, much dearer on this side of the Abrishmi river than they are in Khurasan.’ On the’19th I marched to Shahrud, distant 28 miles. About four miles after leaving Mags the road enters the hills and is very bad. There is a better road, but it is considerably longer. The road I followed went up and down over very broken ground until about the nine* teenth mile from Mags, when the plain of Bostan is entered upon. Here there are many fine villages. At 2-3 miles from my starting point the poor town of Bostan is reached I rode through the town and saw the tomb of a hermit called Sultan Bayazid He is buried under an old sycamore tree, and close to his grave there is a mosque with encaustic tiles. His body is said not to have decayed in the least, and to be as fresh n ?l r00 l 0f th J 1 . 8 . statement was adduced. This hermit, name, for its18 months since I was last here, has not even a wall round it. The finest bazaar, outside the town, belongs to, and is chiefly inhabited by, Russian Armenian traders, who are very busy in dispersing to jjll parts of Khurasan the goods which are brought from Russia and landed at Bandar Gez, on the Caspian, only five marches from Shahrud. They also largely collect cotton, which they export to Russia; pressed cotton bales for the Russian piece-goods manufacture forming one of the chief articles of export from Shahrud. A disagreeable insect known as shubgez, or night biter, is found here. The bite of this poisonous bug causes a very bad form of fever, of a typhoid character, in those bitten. It does not affect the inhabitants, who seem impervious to the poison of its bite, but I have known several Europeans suffer very severely in consequence of the bite of this bug. I offered a rew ard of 9&lt;A to any one who would bring me a few of these creatures, and in a short time some 20 fine specimens were produced. I brought away a few, preserved in spirits, as I thought it might interest European men of science to examine this creature through a microscope. At Shahrud I got into the main post road, which has been often described, and I will therefore not give any more particulars of my journey to Tehran, where I arrived on the 29th September, having ridden in post from Samnan. I bad to wait some time until my horses and mules arrived, and when they arrived I had to sell them, and submit to the Government of India my bills for the expenses of my journey, which were very moderate, as I tried in every way to spend as little as possible. Chapter X. Journey to Chikishliar and Krasnovodsk. I received a telegram from Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, granting me privilege leave for three months from date of embarkation from Persia to date of landing in India. I returned to England by Chikishliar and Krasnovodsk, on the eastern coast of the Caspian, and will here devote a chapter to the valuable information which I was able to obtain at Krasnovodsk. I wall not describe my journey from Tehran to Bunder Gez on the Caspian, as this part of Persia is w^ell known. I left Bander Gez by a Russian steamer on the 31st October. In the harbour of Gez a small Russian man-of-war is always at anchor, and the mouth of the harbour is guarded by a Russian naval station on the small island of Ashurada, which completely commands the approaches to the port. The Russians must have a very uncomfortable time on this sandy islet, a portion of which is often submerged. We passed on our voyage the Kara Su river, where the Russians are very anxious to build a fort to replace their post at Ashurada, but difficulties have heretofore been made by the Persian Government. No doubt in time these will be overcome. The same day we reached Chikishliar, and remained at anchor for several hours. A number of officers came off to the steamer, played the piano we had on board, and drank a good deal. The visit of the bi-weekly steamer is the only amusement they have, and her arrival is looked for as a sort of theatrical entertainment. Every one who is at all able comes on board. Chikishliar is a miserable place, consisting of a few huts and barracks, a large hospital, and a small bazaar, with a number of Turkoman alachaks, or felt tents, pitched a little way off. The garrison consisted of detachments of the 4th and 5th Battalions of Trans-Caspian Chasseurs, and a battery of artillery without horses, so that the guns could not be moved, consisting of four 8-pounder guns, and four mitrailleuse. Besides the above there was a small detachment of Cossacks stationed here, but the whole garrison was small. The posts on the road taken up by the Russian army on their march to Geok Tepeh are still kept up. There are posts at Zuglolum, Duzolum, and at Khodjam Kala, at the last of these places the outpost is held in some strength. As the road via Michailoff and the railway cannot be used at present for the despatch of a large body of troops, this alternative road is kept up and guarded in case it may be required, to send up a considerable army rapidly. Chikishliar is a barren sand bank, and the water is bad ; the garrison is also very isolated. There is no possible reason for holding it, except that it commands one of the roads to Askabad. Two officers from Chikishliar remained on board the steamer and proceeded with us, on court-martial duty, to Krasnovodsk. One of them was Lieutenant-Colonel Zenosco Zaborski. He was a comparatively young man, and had been expelled from St. Petersburg, and sent to command at this very desolate post for killing a brother officer in a drunken quarrel. He evidently did not like the presence of an English officer on board the steamer, though he vyas quite civil. He told me several mess-room stories, which he hoped I would believe. VVe left Chikishliar about 4 p.m., and steamed northward for Krasnovodsk, passing Michailof66 A/r , . 1nf however was not seen, as it is situated on a gulf, and the regular en route. Michailof, ho ' J h t being too shallow to allow anything but a steamers do not touch the T g e railway wi ]l have to be completed steamer i^^^Michailof before it can be of any great practical use, as at to Krasnovod railway can only be approached by tugs of very small present the^® 1 ^ 1 ^^ at^Krasnovodsk about 9 a.m. on the 1st November and I went draugh . ^ p ] ace Among other things, I made a rough plan of the town, on shore to inspect \ • Kra ^ novo dsk was first occupied by the Russians m 1866 'it consists of a settlement about three quarters of a mile in length, built along t! Vr rp nf the bav There is good anchoring ground close m shore, and two piers w^th tramways for loading and unloading goods alongside which the largest steamers can be moored. Troops and goods can thus be landed without any difficulty, as the troops walk ashore at once, and goods are run along the tramways in small trucks, landingTome wooden huts are first passed, which are used as barracks by the half battalion of infantry stationed here. At present the garrison consists of half a battalion of the 1st Battalion of Trans-Caspian Chasseurs. Ihere is also a battery of artillery of four guns, but without horses, and a very few Cossacks for orderly duty. The military commandant at Krasnovodsk when I arrived was Colonel Novikof, while the civil Governor was Colonel Popof, who is Chief of the Staff of the trans-Caspian Provinces, and was away at Askabad. General Rohrberg is the actual Governor of the whole trans-Caspian region, and his Deputy and Chief of the Staff is Colonel Popof. Both usually reside at Askabad, though there is a fine house for their use at Krasnovodsk. After passing the huts used as barracks, there are some huts of a superior sort used as a hospital. In the centre of the place there is an intrenchment, about 180 yards in depth from the sea, and about 360 yards in length. On three sides it is surrounded by a stone wall, about eight feet high. The side next the sea is open, and has no defence. There is no ditch. The wall is loopholed for musketry, and there is a very low banquette inside for the men to stand on. At the two corners furthest from the sea there are two bastions, giving some flanking defence, and in each of these bastions there are two field guns, about eight or nine pounders. At the extremity of the entrenchment near the sea there are two small low towers, loopholcd for musketry, giving a very slight flanking defence, and the roofs of these low towers are evidently intended for placing a mitrailleuse, though none were in position. There are two gates, hut as the walls do not extend quite down to the sea, and there is an open space between the end of the walls and the sea, one can walk in and out without passing through the gates. There were no sentries at the gates, hut the small main guard inside the fortified quadrangle had a single sentry. In the quadrangle was the Governor’s house, another fine house occupied by officials, the main guard house, and some buildings used as stores, over one of which a flag was flying, bearing the red Geneva cross. There was also a small building used as a church. Besides the two long piers at the extremities of the harbour, there was a third small pier, about the centre of the fortified position, and here two small steamers were anchored. One of them carried two three-pounder guns. Near them was an old worn-out steamer for condensing. There were also some sheds in which water was condensed for the use of the population. All drinking water was condensed, exactly as it is done at Aden. After passing the fortified quadrangle, there was a sort of small square, with shops around it, and beyond that the commencement of two streets, with a few houses had been laid out. Krasnovodsk has no depth, being built along the seashore Pio- s Were wandering about in great number, eating the garbage which was thrown into the beautiful clear waters ot the Caspian. The Caspian generally is not a clear sea hut opposite Krasnovodsk it was worthy of the blue Mediterranean. Besides the steamer in which I had arrived, there was another large steamer which had arrived from TGkn discharging stores at one of the long piers. Haifa dozen coasting vessels were also anchored m the bay. Moored to one of the piers were two very largt iron light drauJht barges m which troops are sent to Michailof, towed by a small tug steamer K,as novodsk is a place of no strength, and it has no proper flanking defences and U commanded by lulls behind it, within close rifle range. It is, however onite J.L enough to resist any attack likely to he made upon it by Turkomans ’ T1! h'n ? the hack ot Krasnovodsk form a natural ramplt, and^lmrcould be effeciual^ held by a small force. Besides the four guns mounted on the ratnnarts a co^ siderable number of guns and some mitrailleuse are kept in store h t th ’ horses for the artillery, as forage-has to be brought from a distance In the ha?-.' 0 outside the fortification, there are a number of shops kept by Armenians Two 0 rthree of these shops are of a superior description, and contain a great variety of goods, including furniture. The Bay of Krasnovodsk has a depth of nine feet of water at the end of the piers, and much deeper water a little further out, and, protected as it is from most winds, it is likely to become a place of importance. The scarcity of good drinking water is, of course, a drawback, but, as at Aden ships are supplied with large quantities of distilled water at a reasonable rate, so at Krasnovodsk good water can be distilled at a comparatively small costand, with more apparatus, in unlimited quantity. Though the starting point of the trans-Caspian railway is from Michailof, and not from Krasnovodsk, it cannot be long before the Michailof railway is continued to Krasnovodsk. The distance by road between Molla Kari, the nearest station on the Michailof line of railway, and Kras novodsk is about 80 miles, and the railway must sooner or later be brought from Molla Kari to Krasnovodsk. The line was only commenced from Michailof instead of from Krasnovodsk because it was made during a period of war, and had to be finished in a hurry, so that a saving in distance was a very serious consideration. At present, the communication between Krasnovodsk and Michailof is kept up by small tug steamers, towing large iron barges, in which troops and provisions are carried. There are no natural obstacles, I understand, to the construction of the line from Molla Kari to Krasnovodsk. The line of railway from Michailof to Kizil Arvat is 217 versts, or about 144 miles, in length, and the trains run the distance in about 19 hours. I could not discover that the line had been continued beyond Kizil Arvat. Materials were collected at Kizil Arvat for the extension of the line, but I could not hear, while at Krasnovodsk, that it had actually been continued to Bami. A small branch line had, [ heard, been con structed to some petroleum springs, where a large quantity of petroleum had been discovered. This discovery is a matter of great importance, as petroleum is burned in most of the engines used on the line, and will be burned in all of them as soon as the necessary alterations can be carried out. In the machines for distilling water, also, petroleum is burned. If the supply of petroleum is large, a town will soon rise up at these springs, as it did at Baku, which I can remember some 17 years ago as nothing more than a village, though now it contains 40,000 inhabitants. There are said to be two spots on the road between Molla Kari and Krasnovodsk where water is usually found, but even if there was no water the difficulty would easily be surmounted, as it would only be necessary to place a distilling apparatus on the seashore about half way, or perhaps at two spots. The greater part of the line would be made close to the shore, and water could be distilled from the sea. I understand that the garrison of the trans-Caspian province consists of six battalions of infantry, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Battalion of Trans-Caspian Chasseurs, and about 1,000 Cossacks (the Cossacks at present garrisoning the province belong to the Taman regiment of the Kuban). These Cossacks are divided into sotnias of 130 men each. I could not find out exactly what artillery were quartered in the province, but I believe there are about 450 artillerymen scattered about. Besides the above there is a railway battalion, which works the railway from Michailof to Kizil Arvat, and a mounted militia of about 120 Turkomans in the Russian service, who garrison Annau, Gawars, and other small places, where it is not considered de sirable to have Cossacks. The number of guns in the trans-Caspian province is out of all proportion to the number of artillerymen stationed there, the whole of the artillery that was used at the siege of Geok Tepe having remained in the country. After seeing all that was to be seen at Krasnovodsk, I went on board the steamer which left in the afternoon for Baku. Some way out from the harbour we passed a light ship, from which we embarked two sailors, and the next day we reached Baku. The port of Baku I found crowded with ships and steamers, the number of the latter having largely increased within the last two years. A number of steam vessels are employed in carrying petroleum up to the mouth of the Volga. The steamers are nearly all of English or Swedish build, a few having also been constructed in Germany; most of them belong to three firms. The Kafkas Mercury Company own many steamers, and they receive a considerable subsidy from the Government for carrying the mails. The Lebit Company, though unsubsidized, has many steamers. Lebit means “ swan ” in Russian, and the Company is called after Mr. Swan, an Englishman. The Greek firm of Kousis has also a few steamers, which ply regularly between Astrakan, Baku, and Enzelli in Persia. These companies I have mentioned are all carrying companies, and carry freight for any consignee, and would be only too glad to be employed by the Government. Besides the above the Swedish Company of Nobel have many steamers of large size, I think 12, which are engaged in carrying petroleum to the mouth of■ h i, .u,w ’'‘'• 1I4UIL 68 , T , • rnvpmment own ei^ht steamers on the Caspian, which are the Volga.

Ihe a | ny „ , jt j f or a t Derbent and Petrofsk, two ports on in hand A line is also proposed from Baku to Astara, the border town of Russia and Persia on the south-west coast of the Caspian. Chapter XI. Baku to Tiflis. Time required to move an Army from Baku to Kusan, near Herat. If it was desired to place 20,000 men accompanied by a proper proportion of artillery and cavalry on the eastern shore of the Caspian, it could be done within a week without the smallest difficulty. Troops would be taken up at Baku at Derbent, and at Petrofsk, and could he landed, some at Chikishliar and some at Krasnoyodsk. I calculate that 20,000 men with a fair amount of munitions of war, and inclusive ot cavalry and artillerv, would he taken across by the 40 steamers, and the four or five large sailing vessels*, that are available, in two trips, which could be accomplished, even from Petrofsk, the most distant port from Krasnovodsk, within a week. The troops first landed could be pushed forward, while the others were being brought across. I would suppose about 8,000 men to he landed at Chikishliar and about 12,000 at Krasnovodsk. The troops landed at Chikishliar would be pushed forward in daily detachments of about 1,000 men, via Zuglolum, Duzolum, and Khodjam Kala to Bami. Provisions in large quantities from Persia could be collected both at Duzolum and Bami. The troops sent via Chikishliar could not arrive at Askabad quite so soon as those sent by Krasnovodsk. As all arrangements w r ere made a short time ago for the continuation of the railway line to Band and the materials are actually on the spot, no doubt before the advance was made the line would be opened from Michailof to Bami, or for a distance of about 177 miles. Even if the railway had not been completed to Krasnovodsk, and still started from Michailof, no delay would, 1 believe, occur, as while half a battalion could be forwarded by water from Krasnovodsk to Michailof daily another half battalion could be marched along the coast from Krasnovodsk to Molla Kari, the first station out of Michailof towards Kizil Arvat, which is the nearest point of the railway to Krasnovodsk. Troops could be forwarded from Michailof and Molla Kari, to Bami, by the railway, at the rate of about 1,000 a day, one train leaving Michailof, and another leaving Molla Kari each with 500 men daily. Thus it would require 12 days or a little more to clear Krasnovodsk of the last troops which had arrived. About 24 hours would he required for the journey of 177 miles from Michailof to Bami. The distance from Bami to Askabad is about 113 miles, and this, at 15 miles a day, would require eight days. The whole period required for the last troops to arrive vid Krasnovodsk would according to this calculation be about 28 days from the time they left the ports on the western shore of the Caspian. The troops that came vid Chikishliar would take a little longer in marching, but as there need be comparatively little delay in starting them from Chikishliar they would probably arrive within two days of the time laid down for the troops from Krasnovodsk. Thus we may say that Ru*ssia could easily place an army of 20,000 men in Askabad within a month. This with between 6,00 i 0 1 v nd 7 ^ 0 ° Wh ° at P resentform the garrison of the trans-Caspian province, would be quite sufficient for an offensive movement in any direction.We will suppose that the point aimed at was Herat. The distance from Askabad to Herat, via Sarakhs, is about 330 miles. If the Russians pretended that their objective point was Merv, and that they were marching for the Merv country, they would naturally march down the Ataks of Daragez, and Kalat Nadari, and would cross the Tejend a little north of Sarakhs, or if they pretended to repair the canal, which formely conveyed water across the desert from below Sarakhs, they would even he able without suspicion being excited to come one march south of Sarakhs, as that is the point where a dam would have to be raised, at a place called Kizil Kya, whence the waters were turned into the old canal by the Persian army which advanced to the Merv country in 1860. Some troops could be pushed from Askabad up to this point long before the arrival of the whole of the troops from the Caspian seaboard. From Sarakhs to Herat itself, in a direct line, is 147 miles. By the road surveyed by Mr. Lessar, the Russian engineer, from Sarakhs to Kusan, the first Afghan fortress in the Herat district which he visited, the distance is 145 miles, and that is the whole distance that would have to be traversed by Russian troops marching from Sarakhs to Kusan, in the neighbourhood of Herat. I do not think that the road by Kusan would he the one followed by the Russians, but that a more direct road, reducing the distance a little, would be taken after the caravanserai called Robat Surk, or Abdulla Khan, was reached, but even if the road surveyed by Mr. Lessar, and which he says is fit for wheeled conveyance with very little making, were adopted, the neighbourhood of Herat could he reached by the Russian army from Sarakhs, marching only 15 miles a day, in 10 days. We should receive no warning of this movement until the Russian troops had made one or two marches on this road, for as far as the Kizil Kya dam, to the south of Sarakhs, they might fairly advance under the pretext that they were marching on Merv, and had no thought of approaching Afghanistan. We should thus only have a very few days notice previous to the appearance of the Russian army before Herat. I have above calculated that 26,000 men, inclusive of the garrison in the trans- Caspian province, had been placed at Askahad. After leaving sufficient garrisons at Askahad, Luttabad, Kahka, Kara Chacha, and Sarakhs to prevent any hostile demon stration by the Turkomans, for which duty, I have allowed 11,000 men, an army 15,000 strong would be available for the advance on Herat. Besides these 2,000 or 3,000 Tekeh horsemen could easily he hired, who would he most useful guides and scouts, as they are well acquainted with every foot of the country towards Herat, having been so constantly occupied in plundering in that direction. As soon as the movement from Baku commenced, an advance guard of 3,000 men from the trans-Caspian garrison could be pushed on at once towards Sarakhs, and as fresh troops arrived at Askabad reinforcements could be sent on. Small detachments of Russian infantry are perfectly safe from Turkoman attack in an intrenched position, so guards in small strength could he left all along the road. The country to be passed over between Askahad and Babadurmuz, by Annau and Gawars, is, I believe, the worst part of the whole road between Askhabad and Herat, but this is within Russian territory, and with the Russian posts at Annau and Gawars to render assistance there would be no difficulty worth mentioning. The marches from Askabad would he, Annau, nine miles; Gawars, 13 miles; Babadurmuz, 25J miles; Lutfabad, 14 miles; Kahka, 18^ miles ; Khodja Ahmad, or Naurek, 11^ miles; Dushak, 14 miles; Melina, 29 miles (this march would probably he divided for infantry, if possible); Kara Chacha, 11 miles. From Kara Chacha to Sarakhs is about 37 miles, and Mr. Lessar, the Russian engineer, says there is no water between the two places, but I am assured by Turkomans that there is water at one spot on the road, namely, at a place called Aj Kui or Aj Cha. Probably, Mr. Lessar’s guides did not care to go a little off the road to find the water. This distance of 37 miles would, therefore, be done in two marches, making the number of marches to Sarakhs 11 or 12, and the distance by road 182J miles. On this road from Askahad to Sarakhs I have not only followed Mr. Lessar’s report, hut have made most careful inquiries from Turkomans, and have myself seen a small portion of the road in the Daragez Atak. From Sarakhs to Kusan I know the road only from Mr. Lessar’s account. I rode up some 18 miles beyond Mohsinabad, on the Persian bank of the Hari Rud, but I was told that the easy road was on the other side of the river, by Robat Surk, or Abdulla Khan, and that is the road by which Mr. Lessar travelled. Mir Panj Yusuf Khan was quite willing to give me horsemen to travel that or any other road, and I could easily have done so previous to Mr. Lessar’s journey had I not felt that I was precluded by my instructions from crossing into Afghanistan. Mr. Lessar found no difficulty on his 8062. S70 n fmm Sarakhs to Kusan, which he did in five days. He found grass journey of l 4 ^ ™ “AT r vals and describes the road as requiring very little making to and water at frequent i ^ ^ would pear that t hi s portion of the journey could enable wheeled veh c P ^ without any difficulty in about 10 days, taking an average of u a i rC mn d es y a^ay la This, with the 12 marches above given to f^rakhs, would be 22 davs If two days extra were allowed for halts and var.ous difficulties it would Tn tiL Bnssian force 24 days from Askabad to appear before Kusan. Supplies for the northern^uart^of the 6 road could he drawn in lar|e F quantities from K,.chan, Daragez, and the Uaragez Atak itself. For the portion of the road near Sarakhs provisions could be brought without anv difficulty from Mashad, and for the more southern part of the journey the Bakharz district of Persia, which is fertile, could be drawn upon. Camels in very large numbers could be hired, as even two years ago, when the 1 email autho- rities at Mashad were not nearly so much under the thumb of Russia as at present, the owners of 2,000 camels were forced to proceed with provisions to the Russian camps, under orders from the Prince Governor of Khurasan. From Baku I proceeded by railway to Tiflis. The railway not being yet opened to the public, and a ticket only being obtainable by special permission, I called upon Baron Hubsh, the Governor of Baku, who kindly furnished me with an order to travel by the railway. From Tifiis I proceeded by diligence ovei the Gaucasus to \ ladikafkas, which took 36 hours. After staying three hours in Vladikafkas, I got into the train, and travelled m'd Taganrog, Karkov, and Kief to Warsaw and Berlin. I was seven days and seven nights in the train between Yladikafkas and London, only stopping six hours in Berlin, as the trains did not correspond at that place. Chapter XII. On the desirability of having an English Officer stationed o?i the Per so-Afghan Frontier. In the above report I have repeatedly shown why it is desirable that English influence should be kept up on the Perso-Afghan frontier, and that in Bakharz, Khaf, Kaian, Birjand, and Sistan an English officer should be often seen. As yet English influence is paramount in these border districts of Persia, and it is most important that it should not give place to Russian influence in parts bordering Afghanistan. To the northward the power of Russia is already too great to allow of our regaining our former position, but there our interests are not of so much importance as in the more southern provinces. In Article 7 of the Treaty signed last year between the Russian and Persian Governments, defining the northern border of Persia and the trans- Caspian province, it is agreed that, &lt;£ With a view to the observance and fulfilment of “ I* 16 stipulations of the present Convention, and in order to regulate the proceedings “ of the Turkomans residing on the Persian frontier, the Government of His Majesty “ the Emperor of all the Russias shall have the right to nominate Agents to the frontier “ points of Persia. In all questions concerning the observance of order and tranquillity “ in th ® districts contiguous to the possessions of the High Contracting Parties the appointed Agents will act as intermediaries in the relations between the Russian and Pei sian authorities. By this article it will be seen that Russia has the right to appoint Agents to the frontier points of Persia. This would refer primarily to the north and north-eastern districts of Persia, in which these Russian Agents would be more powerful than the Persian Governors. It seems to me that while Russia is placing Agents on the frontier of Persia, we should have somebody to keep up our influence m those districts of Persia which are conterminous with Afghanistan ^ paramount influence L co” wav a ?LntI Calle&lt;i - Would have a ”r“ (rui'jT; 1 t * u..u.».days of us.’ This means that a man mounted on a good horse can carry letters from Mashad to Askabad in four days, and the effect of this feeling of the nearness of Russia is very great in Mashad. For these reasons I think it undesirable that any English official should permanently reside in that place. What I would suggest is that an English officer should be appointed as military attache to the British Legation at Tehran, whose duty it would be to reside on the Perso-Afghan border, keeping our Government informed of what is happening both in Afghanistan and to the northward. He should reside at Mohsinabad, in Bakharz, the new fort and town built by the Persians near the Hari Rud, visiting all the country from Sarakhs to Sistan. Mohsinabad is a good place for getting information of what is happening in the Turkoman country and amongst the border tribes of Afghanistan, as Saruks, Jamshedis, Hazaras, and Firuz Kuhis, living to the northward of Herat. No doubt news as to what is passing in Herat itself is sent by MirzaTuki Khan, the British Agent in Herat, to the Indian Government, but I do not think good information about the Turkoman country, and especially about the tribes living on the northern border of Afghanistan, is sent. Mirza Abbas Khan, C.I.E., the British Agent in Mashad, though an intelligent man and doing the best he can, is too far off to get information of what is occurring on the northern border of Afghanistan. He himself told me that he had little or no communication with the Saruk tribe, and now that Merv is very much under Russian influence the Saruks have become a very important factor in Afghan affairs. If I were sent out again as military attach^, or whatever it might be considered desirable to call me, as I have made friends with the Hazara and Timuri tribes and chiefs, I could move about in a way that would not be possible to any one unacquainted with these chiefs. I have shown by my last two journeys on the Persian frontier that I am not likely to do anything to get myself into difficulties. When I was at Mohsinabad I had heard of the road travelled later by Mr. Lessar, and could easily have travelled it if I had not considered that I was not permitted to cross the Afghan frontier. The same reason prevented my visiting Ghurian, where I should have been received with all honour, having had a very civil letter from the Afghan Governor. Should it be considered desirable that some one should collect information as to the exact boundary between Afghanistan and the Merv country, I could, without any difficulty, visit Panj Dell, the head-quarters of the Saruk Tur komans subject to Afghanistan. I could also go to Kushk and Kala Nau, the head quarters of the Jamshedis and Hazaras, and for this I should not even need the permission of the Afghan Government. The question of the boundary between Afghanistan and the Merv country will sooner or later come up, and it would be a great advantage to have information collected by some officer ready to lay before the Boundary Commission when it was appointed. I am informed that great difficulties were caused to the Sistan mission by the want of previous information about the country, and that it would have assisted them very materially if some officer had quietly gone over the ground a year or two before the arrival of the Commission. But whether it is thought necessary or not to inquire at present into this boundary question, I would suggest that I might be per mitted to return to the Perso-Afghan* border, so as to continue to forward information from that quarter. I do not think Russia will long delay before she makes another forward movement. There is an army in the Caucasus, numbering about 130,000 men, for whom employment must be found, or discontent will arise in the Caucasus. This may, of course, be found for them in Armenia, but if no advance is made by Russia in that direction I think that before very long an advance eastward will be made to keep this army employed. There is a very strong feeling of discontent in Russia with the result of the Turkish war, and the Government, for the sake of popularity, will sooner or later be forced into war. If the war does not take place in Armenia, a movement will be made, firstly towards Merv, and then probably in the direction of Herat, though it will be some years before Herat itself is actually threatened. Even with the incomplete means of communication at present at their disposal, I have shown that a Russian army could easily arrive at Kusan, in the immediate neighbourhood of Herat, from Askabad, in 24 days, and that there are no physical difficulties whatsoever to the march, the whole being through a fairly fertile country, and only one range of mountains, of inconsiderable height (3,100 feet), having to be crossed. This range Mr. Lessar calls the Barkhut mountains. I saw them, and have marked them in my map as the Siah Bubuk range. Like almost every range of mountains in Persia, they have duplicate names. The Turki speaking people to72 tt , »ao«b, “S' b '‘ ‘ h ' P ' 0|&gt;1 ”'' t0m whom I got the name, caU them bias « ■ ^ Government the very great I hope that I may he pei froiitier and that I, having experience of the necessity of havmg an office —^ b ’ e c h 0S en for this duty.

Note-A map of Khurasan and the neighbouring countries is attached tor facility ot reference The country from the Hari Rud to Dumb, to the northward of Sistan has been 'surveyed by myself, as has also the country eastward fromBirjand to Naiband across the Lut desert. ‘ Neither of these portions of country had been previous y surveyed The road followed by me in my first journey in 1880-81 is coloured pale blue, my last journey in 1881 and 1882 being coloured dark orange. A comparison of mv map with any previously published will show that the country south ot Khaf, which has always been shown as a salt desert, is nothing ot the sort, and that I have greatly increased the knowledge concerning the Perso-Afghan frontier for several hundred miles. The positions of Askabad and Sarakhs are given in this map as lately fixed astronomically by the Russians. These positions were furnished me by General Stebnitski, the head of the Russian Topographical Department at Tiflis. It will be observed that the position of Sarakhs has been shifted considerably to the eastward by these observations, which, if confirmed by further observations, is important.APPENDICES.

There is a better and shorter road from Faizabad than this by Dughabad and Sakhi. At 2J miles pass the small town or large village of Ruskhar, sometimes called Khaf-i-Karai. The road good and thickly inhabited, but a good deal infested by Turkomans, who destroyed two villages a few years ago, carrying off everybody who inhabited them. Chief villages passed, Cbamanabad and Nasrabad, called also Bala Khaf. A small town, the head-quarters of the Timuri tribe in Persia. Supplies procurable in considerable quantities. Road leads over a plain for 11 miles, when an open pass in the Bakharz hills is reached. This pass is called Dahna Shishab, Dahna being the word used in this part of the country for pass. The road then passes over broken country for 11 miles, when the fort of Karat, with a curious minar or pillar outside it, is reached. Provisions in small quantities, twenty houses in strong fort. Road from Khaf passable, with a little work, to guns. Road leads over plain, until, at 20 miles, a number of ruined kariz, or abandoned canals, are reached.

At eight miles pass a spring of brackish water called Shurab. At 16 miles pass a kariz containing water in spring. On a hill above the road near this kariz is a large stone about six feet in height, placed on end on the top of the hill. Tradi tion says it was so placed by a young woman, hence the nameSang-i-Dokhtur, “ the virgin’s stone.” At 32 miles Sherabad is reached, the first inhabited village on Afghan soil, and, at 35 miles, the Afghan fort of Ghurian. The whole distance of 620 miles is over a road perfectly passable to guns, and over a plain except at two points, one near Giebur and the other near Karat, where the road would require a few hours’ work to make it passable. The first of these points could, however, be avoided by a detour of a few hours’ march. This road is the shortest from Tehran to Ghurian, and thence onward to Herat.1 ’JiUiUJll'UU ■' U -1 ■ 1 w l 76 Route No. 2. Route from Birjand to Karman. Lieutenant-Colonel C. E.

At 15 miles a haoz is reached, called Haoz-i-Khan, where there has always been plenty of good water, but this year it is empty, in consequence of not being cleaned out. The Governor of Karman hag been in the habit of paying seven tomans for the cleaning out of the channels which fill this 'tank. This year he refused to pay, and the channels were not cleared out at the proper season, so there is no water in the tank. About eight miles before reaching Chahil Paie cross some low hills.

He also describes local populations, tribes and chiefs, and their present and historical actions and allegiances.The author records his opinion that due to a general fear of Torcoman raids, and a positive attitude towards Russia, the region of Khurasan [Khorāsān] could willingly fall under Russian sway; he therefore urges the instalment of an English officer on the Perso-Afghan frontier to maintain a British influence there.The report is written in twelve chapters, and is followed by five appendices giving detailed descriptions of routes travelled, with mileages.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Charles Edward Stewart</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Merv</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mashad</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khorasan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Herāt</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribal relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Topography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00007f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
