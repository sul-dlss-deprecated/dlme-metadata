The design of the back is simple with unbalanced body proportions and good workmanship. The piece is carefully made. \r\n\r\nThis scarab functioned as a supportive amulet and should secure life and justice. The piece could serve in this world and in the afterlife; as Amun's trigram, it should assure the support of the god.
