WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 6th March 1934. My dear George, You sent us under your printed letter of 28th December, No. S.7589/7589/91, copy of a despatch from Baghdad on the subject of an Iraqi enquiry as to the date of institution of Koweiti and Bahreini nationality. I am afraid that owing to pressure of more urgent questions disposal of this has been delayed and that even now we are not in a position to give very much assistance. 3. Humphrys suggests in his despatch that the inhabitants of both Koweit and Bahrein, for reasons which he gives, remained technically Ottoman subjects until the ratiiication of the Treaty of Lausanne and that on this basis the date of creation of both Bahreini and Koweiti nationality is tne date on which the Treaty of Lausanne came into force. I doubt, however, if the position is, in fact, quite so simple. It is quite true that in the case of G# W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Oifice, S • W • 1. X . Bahrein/- a - © 3 &lt; , &gt;'7. A 4 ^ B.ahreiii the Ottoman Government withdrew their claim to suzerainty in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 19id. But we had never recognised this claim, any more than we have recognised Persian claims, and we should, I imagine, oe justified in maintaining (and it would indeed oe desirable tO' maintain) that we had consistently dealt with Bahrein as an independent State, possibly from so remote a date as our Treaty of 1820. On that assumption the importance of the Convention of 1913 would be merely that it represented a formal abandonment by Turkey of claims to which we had never assented - an abandonment similar to that which we hope to secure from Persia in the proposed General Treaty with her. 4. Ko.weit is more difficult. We gave the Sheikh of Koweit an undertaking on the 3rd November 1914 that Koweit would be recognised as 'an independent principality' under Brioish protection. Humphrys is, I think, probably technically correct in maintaining that the date of the creation of a Koweiti nationality consequent on this assurance is the date on which the Treaty of Lausanne came into force. On the other hand, as you know, we have been anxious to give as little prominence as possible to the/the position of Koweit as a portion of the former Turkish Empire in the interests of avoiding any effort, e.g. hy the United states Government, to claim that they had inherited capitulatory rights in Koweit (you will remember that this specific point has been very present to us in connection with the revision of the Koweit Order in Council), and if on any ground it was possible to antedate the creation of Koweiti nationality to, e.g. our assurance of 1914 there would, I think, be much on general grounds to be said for this. 5. The above represent our provisional views. But the points involved seem to me to be much more matters for expert legal advice in the Foreign Office than for the India Office. At the same time we are, of course, closely interested in the question of the reply to be given, and I venture to suggest that you might care to consider it further in the Foreign Office and give us an opportunity of commenting before any instructions actually issue to Baghdad.
