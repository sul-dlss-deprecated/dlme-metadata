Jr. </dc:creator><dc:date>1973-07-03</dc:date><dc:description>Leslie Nichols was a faculty member at the American University in Cairo from 1937 to 1944, serving as chairman of the Journalism Department as well as Admissions Director. Nichols explains his work as head of Admissions to increase AUC’s enrollment (which had decreased from 400 to about 150), which he considered necessary for the journalism program to succeed. He relates his efforts to recruit students by building relationships with secondary schools in Egypt and countries in the region, traveling to Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia and in the process visiting villages on donkey or horseback to interview candidates. He mentions the aim of adding more Arabic-speaking Muslim students, the few Americans attending among the highly international students body, and the impact of World War II on enrollment. Enrollment eventually reached about 300 in his years at AUC. Nichols discusses the aims of the journalism program, and (with commentary by the interviewee, Alumni Director Manucher) mentions its graduates who went on to positions with Egyptian newspapers like Al Ahram and Akhbar al Youm, foreign news bureaus, and positions like press aide to the United Nations Secretary General. He recalls social interactions with students, and visits to their family homes in villages. The challenges of wartime at AUC are addressed, like the heavy teaching loads of remaining faculty. Nichols tells about AUC’s role as a cultural and intellectual center, with performances in Ewart Hall by leading European musicians, drama performances, the Extension Division’s lecture program, and visits from world and regional leaders. </dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
