The first document by Haines explains the history leading up to the boundary dispute between Persia and Baluchistan over the ownership of Mekran and the actions that have been taken by each party. It also focuses on the original documents, drawn up by Major-General Sir Frederic John Goldsmid, which marked the boundary. Haines closes the document by stating the necessity of speedy delimitation. The second document by MacDonald focuses mainly upon the benefits of quickly arranging a settlement over the boundary as he believes that it shows the support of the British for the people of Mekran and also provides a countermove against recent Russian involvement in the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arbitrator, Sistan Arbitration Commission</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Frederick Weston Peile Macdonald</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hermann Anderson Haines</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kohuk</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kharan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mekran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00009d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
