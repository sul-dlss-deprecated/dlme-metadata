Dear Chaplin, Would you please refer to your letter of 18th February to Harrison of the India Office about the Sheikh of Koweit’s Bashiyah date garden. 1 note that the Political Resident, the Ambassador at Bagdad, the India Office and the Foreign Office consider that, in the event of the Sheikh^ present appeal falling, reference to the Court of Cessation should be dispensed with. In view of this consensus of opinion we are filling to agree that Chaplin, Esq.. , Foreign Office. /litigationlitigation need not be carried further I asauiae that, when the present appeal has been settles, the question of uionetary compensation will arise end that you will be consulting us about that in due course. In that connection it occurs to me that, if the compounding payment already made in respect of taxation covered the Sheikh of Koweit f s Bashiyah property, the amount so included would fall to be deducted from any compensatory payment in respect of loss of possession, since the Jieikh would presumably not be liable to taxation on the Bashiyah property.

The Iraqi Court of Cassation was formed in Baghdad on 30th September, 1943, under the presidency of Dawood 3amra, Assistant to the Judge, and the membership of Arif as-Seweici and Hasan Kamil Tatar, authorized to pronounce judgement in the name of F i s hajesty the King of Iraq., and have pronounced the following Decision i - The Appellant ; V.aj eeha &amp; Abdul Jalil son &amp; daughter of Jamal and Sulaeiman al-Shawaf, the guard ian of Kamal Abdulla az-Zuhair, the insane, in addition to the legacy of Aw&amp;sha az-Zuhair, Hajyiah az-Zuhair and AbdulIs az-Zuhair.

Shaikha sons ana daughters of Ali bin Salim bin iiubarak as-Subah, and Hissa bint Salman al-Hamood &amp;. “asmyia bint Halah al Reiqan, arid Subah, Lilv^a, Bazza and Beebi, sons and daughters of f:asir bin Mu barak as-Subbah, and Mubarak, Khalid, Hahad, Sharifa, h a shya ana kasmya, sons and daugh ters of Karnad bin Mubarak as-Subah, and Abdulla bin Mubarak as-Subah, Tiie President of the Land Settlement Committee of Fao District has issued decisions to the effect that the plots numbered 35, 56, 57, 38, 39 &amp; 40 of the estate ho,5 which is called al-Badaagiyah, are to be considered as Amyryia Land authorized by '• Tapu” to the Responaents, whose names are mentioned above, i,e,, oubir Mubarak as-Sabah ana his colleagues, as their ownership of the land has been proved. When the appellants appealed against the abovementioned decisions, the Basrah Court of Appeal for Land Settlement has aecided on 21-5-45, by joined Los. 224, 225, 226, 227 , 228, 229/941, to sanction the said decision and reject tne appeal of the appellants and to make them bear all coats of the Courts. As the appellants were not satisfied with the aforementioned decision, they requested that they may take it to the Court of Cassation to reverse it, so all the documents were summoned and carefully examined, and it was found out that the plots under sonsideration are the foll owing Hos. 35, 36, 39, 37 , 38 &amp; 40) of the estate Lo./ 3 - Radd- a.giyah, and thus the Court of Appeal 1 or Settlement has decided to confirm the registration of the first three plots, for having been re/gistered in 'Tapu' and to register the other three plots again, as it has been proved that the respondents had had a free hand in the plants of the said land. When all the papers were seen by the courts anc examined, it was found out that these plots were originally the property of Ayesha az-Zuhair, the legator of the appell ants and were registered in the name of Shaikh Mubarak as-Suoah the legator of the respondents, on behalf of Awasha az-Zuhair in a common document. As the two X' ar ti es could not have the registration decided at the “Tapu' Department during the Ottoman Rule, owing to some political problems, the regis tration was sanctioned in the presence of the British Consul, Basrah, on 2lst Muh&amp;rrsjp, 1326. When Basrah was occupied by the British in 1915, these plots were then registered in the name of the heirs of Mubarak as-Subah. This registration was carried out by the man who was then acting on behalf of the Civil AGministr&amp;tion in the 'Tapu 11 Department, in August 1915, relying upon the sanction given by the British Consulate ana it was not confirmed by the possessor of the legacy or her agent in “Tapu”. Since then the respondents and their legator remained having free hand in those plots up to tnis day, and as the state of having free hand fxxx* in a land by the person who has been getting the crops of the said land, has been considered by the Lav of Land Settlement to be the fact proving the ownership, and on the other hand the continuance of the negligence of having a free hand for a period of ten years, this negligence makes it necessary to neglect the rights of having a free hand, and it has been proved that the respondents have had the free hand in the land for a period oi about thirty five years and that tne appellants have neglected their rights of having a free- hand in the said land during the same period, ana that the judgement passed by the Court of 1st instance of r&gt;asrah on 15-6-193815-6-43?under ho. 373/1935, which, contained the cancellation of the KHAKANY1A Documents given to the respondents in August 1915, as the registration had not been reached in the “Tapu”, such judgement is only a document which the Court may consi der, and as the decision had not reached the final sta^e; and this was proves by the fact that an appeal was taken to the Court of Cassation, according to the power practised by tiie Court of Cassation to examine the said judgement inspite of the fact that the legal time was expired. When this Court saw the case, it was founa tnat the settlement oi these points had already been published, and so the Court sent the case to the Settlement Committee ^ or tnem to examine it, and the negligence of the saia judgement by the Settle ment Court of Appeal was the right thing to be done and the Judgement which has been taken to the Court oi Cassation was accord ingl to the Law, and so it ■was decided to sanction the said judgement thx and that the appellants are to bear al3 the expenses of taking the case to the Court of Cassation.&lt;z V: '*LE COPY ^tf(o Te legram.

Extrac t from Political Agency, Kuwait letter D»0« No,670—2/5 dated 12th September, 1943* x x XXX X I visited &gt;ao by launch on the 7th of September where X was met by Shaikh Mohammad bin Ahmed. The following day I went to Basra and called at the Consulate and on Judge Good in his chambers in Court. I give below the result of my investigations and consultations. 2. BASHTTAH ( a ) will recollect that originally I advised against a suit for the return of the purchase money and gave my reasons for doing so in my letter No. C/545-2/5 of 4th October, 19U. Later after consultation with Nasrat al Farisi in Baghdad I revised my opinion and for the reasons stated in my telegram No. C/203 of 2nd April, 1943 was in favour of a suit being filed. The case was heard in Basrah in August and the verdict was given for the defendants. During my interview with Judge Good on Wednesday he regretted that they had been forced to give the decision against His Highness in Basrah and expressed the view that the Sheikh had no case. This statement was volunteered, and as I did not feel that I could proper!} question the Judge about a case which I gathered he had himself tried I did not pursue the matter. An appeal has been lodged in Baghdad but no date of hearing has yet been fixed. (b) In view of the Judge's statement and for the reasons given previously I nave little hope that the case will succeed on appeal or on reference to the Court of Cassation should such a reference be necessary and considered desirable. We should therefore be prepared to make a monetary payment to the Shaikh in compensation for his being dispossessed of property we had guaranteed should remain in his possession. In order to mitigate the feeling of chagrin which he will no oubt feel at our failure to fulfil our undertaking I consider that our monetary payment should be prompt and generous. It will be recalled that so far he has not made any request that the numerous sums expended by him on lawyers and in Court fees in /fightinggm - 2 - fighting this loag ba/fctle for the Bashiyah : should be in whole or in part met by His Majesty's Government* - This point should in my opinion be taken into consideration in computing the sun to which he will be entitled* I suggest that steps be taken now to ascertain the sum due to His Highness in the event of further adverse judicial verdicts* .mpi S 0®Y Q 1 vX ^ 'n ^ ° i y 10 political Resident at Shiraa.

Nasarat has been appointed .Ambassador to Turkey but before he leavee he has promised to write memorandum on Faddaghiya for Court of Cassation should a reference be made by Shaikh’s opponents. 6. Suliman Shawwaf our opponent in Faddaghiya case is doing his utmost to avoid service of a copy of judgement of Court of Appeal in order to gain time. Why I know not. 7. it will be necessary to consider question of successor to Nasarat and I think as far as Bashiyeh is concerned Sikandar will be able to represent His Highness both in Basra and Baghdad. Do you agree? 6. I am doubtful of best course to pursue in Faddaghiya which is the more important. Perhaps Baghdad could advise as, if it is only necessary to put a written memorandum to Court of Cassation ei a reference is made by Shaikh's opponent, then Sikandar could be briefed to put Hasarat’s memorandum (para 5) but if case is to be argued a more important man would be desirable.

Although the Political Resident has instructed the Political Agent to advise the Sheikh in a sense contrary to the opinions hitherto expressed by the P olitical Authorit ies (to say nothing of the Bagda d Embassy), I do not think we can or should challenge his action.

In reply to the questions asked in your note of April 3rd (a) I know of no other Estates except the Faddaghiya Bashiyah and Fao.

T/256 of March 30th and T/273 of April 3rd about the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens. It is satisfactory that the Appellate Court has confirmed the decision of the Land Settlement Oomnittee in the Faddaghiya case; and that the Sheikh’s Bagdad lawyer considers that the disappointed appellants are unlikely to take the case to the Court of Cassation, and that if they do they are certain to he unsuccessful. As regards the Bashiyah Kstate, though at an earlier stage, as you will renember, the general view was that it was not much good pursuing the case further, we have no desire to question the Political Resident’s action, which was taken after the Political Agent had consulted the Bagdad Htabassy and the sheikh’s Bagdad lawyer and had made enquiries at Basra* e therefore propose to approve what :he Political resident has done; but we feel that it might be worth v/hile to remind the Political Authorities of the fears they have previously expressed that even if the 3heikh were successful in a suit for the refund of the purchase money, he might not be able to recover the sum awarded him from the heirs of Shafiqah, who was reported in January, 1942, to have no property of any kind besides her shares and her children’s shares in the Bashlyah Garden (see the enclosures to the political Resident’s printed letter No.0/75 mentioned above).

Fadda^hiva G-ardens • &lt; The decision of the Land Settlement Goraraission was that these gardens should be registered in the name of the Subah (Ext® 3227/41). The disappointed appellants may take the case to the Court of Casktion (the Supreme Court in Iraq) which, however, can only deal with points of law. If they do so and the Court confirms the above decision, or if they leave matters as they are, the Faddaghiya question will be settled, (See paragraph 7 of Mr. Crosthwaite*s letter of January 9th 1942 at Ext,19^/42.) Bashivah Cardens The decision of the Land Settlement Commission was that 180 of the 216 shares in these gardens should be allotted to the heirs of Al Zubair and the remaining 36 to the Subah (Ext.5227/42j. The Political Resident advised in December 1941 that the matter should rest there. (See Ext. 7866/4*0 Shortly afterwards, however, it was decided that, although his case was very weak, it was just worth while for the Sheikh to lodge an appeal. (See the correspondence flagged X.) In these circumstances it is unlikely that tire Sheikh will now take the case to the Court of Caption. In his telegram at Ext. 7866/41 the Political Resident also advised against the Sheikh^ putting forward a claim for the refund/refund of the original purchase money from the heirs of the Vendor. (See also Ext. 2099/42.) With this view the Bagdad Embassy agreed. (See their telegram No. 1384 of December 18th, 1941^ Assuming therefore that this proposal will not again be put forvyard,there will be nothing for it but to pay the Sheikh compensation for the land of which he has been dispossessed. Paragraph 4 of the telegram at Ext. 7866/41 recommended that he should be offered the then existing value of this land, which was estimates, at about £1,700. Paragraph 7 - 8 of Mr. Orosthwaite 1 s letter at Ext. 191/42 show that the Foreign Office accept this view of the Bashiyah case.&lt; 3 (? /' bi^ *? ^ f I v/ f v u-iy/ARD mEGR^ , ^ g Allotted to External Departments .-6m To Dated CUN^IDSNT.T AL CODE T^ iilGi^M Political Reeident in the Persian Gulf Secretary of State for India Bahrein, 18,25 hours, 50th March 1943 Received 22,00 hours, 50th March 1943* Co fa O) H o, T/3.56 , Addressed to Secretary of State for India copy by air mail to Government of India Bagdad and Kowe:it.

Dear bright, i 19 s.^.T. b- 9il| January, 1942. 1941 4« yo^r You referred l^th December to the recrudescence Sheikh of Koweit’s date-gardens Treasury must of course be steps that might commit further payments to the Sheikh. S 32453/19 of the of trouble over the and pointed cut that the consulted before we took any Mis Majesty’s Government to make 2. , as you say, the story is very complicated and it will perhaps be oonvenient if I recapitulate it briefly. Our obligations derive from the pledge given in 1914 to Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, whose assistance was required for an expeditionary force, that your gardens, •'which are now in your possession, vis the date-gardens 'situate between v ao and Qurnah, shall remain in your ’•possession and in possession of your descendants, without 'being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes•. A similar pledge was given to Sheikh Khazai of ^chanu&amp;erah. You will see that we promised not only to maintain the two Sheikhs in possession of their estates, but also to ensure that they paid no taxes on them. y\ i in 5 I o \ &lt; a -v&lt; -r 14 z: S 3. as long as the mandatory regime lasted in Iraq, these pledges gave rise to no very great difficulties. We were able by virtue of our control over the Iraqi administration to ensure that no claim for direct taxation was made on the two Sheikhs and their heirs and we were also able to prevent the various persons who thought they had a right to the estates from pursuing their claima. 4. The trouble began when Iraq became fully independent. almost immediately, the Iraqi Government substituted for the old direct tax on land an indirect tax on the sale of produce, from the effects of which it was quite impossible to secure exemption for the heirs of the two Sheikhs. 4t the same time, the claimants to the Tfrhtfikh^ofuKnfceil’s properties began to press their suite. ^6&gt;ag!Try'Th#se cTaim^ arise from trie fact that the S.H. 'right, -sg asury. /transfertransfer of the land to the feheifcpi was never registered in the *Tapu'* registers. Discussions as to the best course to pursue in the altered circumstances followed ; and various abortive proposals were made to the Irani Government. Then, in 1956, with Treasury and india Office concurrence we put forward what were called our ’’comprehensive proposals* to ..the Iraqi Government. You will find the text of these proposals in our official letter E 4766/18/93 of the 5th August, 1936, but the gist was that in order to clear up the uncertainties about the legal tenure of the various properties of the two Sheikhs, land settlement J procedure under a British land settlement officer should be applied to them. In accordance with Iraqi law, this would automatically stop the various suits pending against the Eheikh of Koweit, and we s-oecificallv said that we would be prepared to abide by the decisions of the land settlement officer and by any modifications of these decisions which might result from subsequent appeals to the special court provided for by land settlement law, and that we wouuq undertake not to make any claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of any changes which might result to the present boundaries of the {Sheikhs' lands in consequence of the land settlement procedure. As regards the question of ta at ion^ we said that we were prepared to make no further claim against the Iraqi Government far the exemption of the properties of the two Sheikhs from taxation in Iraq, provided that the Iraqi Government would give a formal undertaking to make no claim for arrears of taxation against either Sheikh and would provide a formal assurance that no discriminatory taxation would oe imposed upon their properties in future. We did not say to the Iraqi Government that we weie ourselves prepared to compensate /theE X 191 t v te Shcilch* for our failure to eecure thenj immunity 'rom the new indirect taxation, uince we did HotrreKmrd thie as a matter that really concerned the'Iraql^ ' Oovernment, but it wee an integral part of the 1§?&amp; scheme that we.should pay them this compensation. 5. In 1338, the Iraqi Government replied to these proposals in what we told them were acceptable terms ^ i„ae tftxt of their reply and of our rejoinder was sent to the Treasury in our official letter £ 6676/20/93 of 'he ?5th November, 1938). cThe only point of importance made by the Iraqi Government was that on points of law appeals could be made from all judgments of the special land settlement court to the supreme court in Iran, the Court of Cassation. i &gt; 6. This is the agreement which has formed the whole basis of the action since tafcen with' regard to the date-gardens. As you point out in your letter, we Cor our part compensated the Sheikhs for their losses in respect of the new indirect taxation. For their part, the Iraqis duly passed legislation waiving their claims against the Sheikhs for the arrears of direct taxation, and land settlement procedure was applied to the Sheikhs* gardens. ; 7. The only question now outstanding - but it -is of course a moat important one - is the completion of the land settlement procedure. in tne case of the large property atJaddighiyah the decision of the land settlement officer was, as we expected, in favour of the Sheikh of Koweit. An appeal has been launched by the disappointed claimant, but if, as we have no reason to believe will not be the case, the appeal goes in favour of the riheikh, he will be given new title-deeds and the Paddighiyah question will be settled. The land settlement officer ruled, however, that a part only of the small Bashiyah estate belonged to the Sheikh. The question is an exceedingly complicated one, and is dealt with at aome Isngth iiv, Ike Correspondence of which Inch, pit tM Treasury, was sent Copies under our reference T 46977SI8/93, of tue&gt; loth August, 1956. X ' C ' J- ^ H /BrieflyBriefly, the facts appear to be that sheikh kubaiak pai4 tht widow of the former owner the purchase-money for this date-garden, but that the formalities of trahefer were never properly carried out and the legality of the transaction was doubtful. In 195? t.e three years before we put forward our ’’comprehensive •’proposals 4 ’, one of the daughters of the former owner was able to e etablish .her claim to a share of the estate in the Iraqi courts, and from that time on it has been recognised that the decision of the land settlement officer on this particular estate might be unfavourable. 3. It Is over this estate that the possibility of further compensation to the Sheikh arises. There can be no doubt that Sheikh Mubarak was 'in possession' of the estate in 1914, and it seems to us therefore clear that if the present Sheikh is Dispossessed of the date- garden, in part or whole, we shall have to pay him compensation. The pledge was given Just because the Sheikhs ownership was not registered in Tapu.J W® had thought that he might be able to.recover the original purchase-money from the heirs of the vendor, but both the Political Resident and the Kabassy at Bagcied are of the opinion that action on these lines would serve n no useful purpose £see Tolitl jal Resident Vs — Ifib bRo. of the 2nd Dece mber and Bagda d AalCKraa 3412 of the 18th December;.

Dear Crosthwaite, e have been getting from the Foreign Office and the India Office copies of recent coramunications passing between them and Bagdad and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about a recrudescence of trouble over the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens. In them there are references to the possibility of a further payment of compensation by H. M. Government. This has come to the Treasurj/ as a sort of shock as we were under the impression that the question of any further payments by H. K. Government disappeared with the settlement of 1940. We should be greatly obliged for a brief summary of the present trouble, if I am correct in assuming from the correspondence that there is a possibility of a later claim on H.M. Government. We have turned up the earlier correspondence referred to in the recent coinnunications but the story is so complicated that it is somewhat hard reading for us here, who are not fully up in all the details, and v/e are not sure that we follow the position correctly. the discussions reach a point where there is anything that might be regarded as a virtual commitment leading up to additional payments by H.I». Government, that is if such payments are ,ot in fact inherent in the 1940 Settlement and the understandings prior thereto. In the latter event we should be glad of information about then now. I am sending a copy of this to Luraby at the India Office. We should of course wish to be consulted before Yours sincerely. P. M. Crosthwaite Esq. , Foreign Office.? v Received under Kuwait Printed letter t!o.C/5R5-^/t Copy of letter Ho.388-2/5 or the 21st September, 1941, rrom the Political Agent, Kuwait, to Eis Highness the After Compliments, It would seem probable that in regard to that part of the Bashiyeh garden which has been registered in the name of the heirs of Ali al Zuhair by the tenth Land Board, Basra, lour Highness could obtain an order for the re-payment of the original purchase price by the heirs of Ali Pasha Zuhair and his wife Shafiqah. The judgment of the Basra £ourt of Instance in suit Ho.373/1932 Abdulla al Zuhair vs. Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir as Subah and others, indicates that such a claim would not be unexpected. Should a favourable judgment be obtained then I unders and that it is improbable that the defendants would be able to find the amount of the original purchase money so that the property would be auctioned and could be bought by Your Highness either direct or through an agent. It would seem important that possession of the land be not relinquished. 2. I am to request that this view of the position in regard to the Bashiyeh garden should be again brought to the notice of four Highness* lawyers.

Of the two courses described in paragraph 2 of the Political itesident’s telegram, it is difficult for us to comment on the first without fuller information. From the er i94i copy of the decision of the Land Settlement Conmission, which was among the enclosures to Prior's express letter No.C/278 of July 9th (copy sent to you under our No. Ext.5227/41), we gather that the 'unofficial documents' to: - . mentioned in the telegram are those purporting to prove the I. V/right, Esq., 1 ,l. Treasury. sale to the Subah of the shares which the Commission has allotted to the neirs of A1 Zubair. We Knov/- nothing more, however,/A however, about the proceedings of the Commission; but equally we see no reason to question the view of the Sheikh^ Legal Adviser and the Political Agent that this course is unlikely to succeeds 3. The Political Agent's recommendation that the second course also should not be adopted comes as something of a surprise, since for some time there has been general agreement that this course should be followed when the right moment came. This has been the view not only of the ^heikls -lawyer (see his letter to the Political -gent of 18th JuJtfc, 1938, co ;y forwarded to the Foreign Office under our No. P*Zi5546/38), but also of the Bagdad Embassy (Houstom-Boswall's letter to Baxter No.8/55/38 of 30th July, 1938 ) ( of the Foreign Office ( Baggallay's letter to Gibson No.E.4697/28/93 of August 15th, 1938), of this Office (Peel's letter to Weightman No.P.Z.5747/38 of August 23rd 1958 ) t and of Weightman when officiating as Political Resident (see his letter to de Gaury No.C/586 of August 30th, copy forwarded to Fc eign Office under our No.P.Z.6206/38). As recently as July 9th the Political Resident asked the Political Agent at Aoweit again to bring to the notice of the SheikHs lawyers the possibility of recovering the original sale value of the land (see Political Resident's express letter No.C/278, copy forwarded to Foreign Office under our No.Ext.5227/41). In these circumstances,and since the abandonment of tliis course would seem bound to lead to claims for compensation from the Sheikh, I do not think we should authorise the Political Resident to reply to the Sheikh as he proposes until he has explained more fully why course (b)$&amp;ould not be adopted. Of the two reasons which he gives, I douot whether we should be justified in accepting the first simply as it stands; .and as regards the second, I do not understand how the Sheikh could be exoosed to similar action in the Paddaghiyah Estate, which to the best of my knowledge was bought and paid for by Sheikh Mubarak and which has now been registered in the name of the Subah. I therefore suggest that we should send a telegram to the Political Resident asking him to explain his reasons more fully, and I should be glad to hear whether you agree, 4, I am also puzzled by the figure of approximately £4,500 given in paragraph 4 of the Political Resident’s telegram. This I assume represents the present value of the 180 shares in the BashiyAh gardens which have been allotted to the heirs of A1 Zubair; but if so the value of the land must have risen enormously since 1955 when, according to the Bagdad despatch to which lioustoun-Boswall refers in paragraph 8 of his letter mentioned above, the value of the whole property (216 shares) was ivihiirori■an £1,881. Our proposed telegram might/the Political Agent (? reoornmcnds) advising the Sheikh against adoption of either course. I agree and request authorisation to reply to the Sheikh accordingly, 4. Present value of property of which the Sheikh has 'been dispossessed is approximately £4500.FILE COPY &gt;*- ^ * ' Q ■ f the Comp*; ; of t h 3 sp Secretary of Stat# (’•p F»P9ig* Affaipaf&gt;V) 4 - OCT 194 - '»■ —■ n»^ ir-i h JL.

Will you please refer to my letter E 4571/28/93 of Augus t about the Sheikh of Koweit’s date garden - 1 ' 1 at Bashiyah. 2. We have now considered the correspondence from Bushire enclosed in your official letter P,Z.5547/38 of — — ^ 9th August* Abdul Jalil’s letter of 18th June in particular seems to make the position a good deal clearer. 3. On the whole we agree with HouBtoun-Boswall*s comments on the three possible courses of action which Abdul Jalil suggests in paragraph ^ Course (b) - to try and reopen the decision in favour of Rafiyah in the Bashiyah case if, on the issue of international law, the Court of Appeal decides in favour of the Sheikh in the Paddaghiyah case - is really out of the question, not only because such a decision in the Paddaghiyah case is J*P. Qibson, Esq,unlikely, 'but because we are now arranging for the proceedings to be stayed and land settlement applied. It is our view that, sooner or later, the Sheikh will have to fall back on course (c) - suing the vendors of the Bashiyah estate for the return of the original purchase money. 4. However, the order of the Chief Officer of Executions attaching part of the Bashiyah estate for a debt owed by Bahijah, although the Sheikh was in possession of the property and Bahijah had got no decision of the Court to show that any part of it really belonged to her, seems high-handed, if not illegal, and we see no harm in the Sheikh trying to upset that order in the Courts (Abdul Jalil*s course (a)), as long as it is made clear to him that in our view his ultimate goal must be course (c). I do not know whether it would be possible for the Sheikh to get the property counter- attached, so to speak, as security for the return of the purchase money. But it seems clear that he and his lawyers must use every loop-hole the Iraqi law allows until the settlement procedure takes effect. I am sending a copy of this, and of my letterof 11th August to Inch at the Treasury, together with copies of Baxter’s letter of 21st July to Houstoun- Boswall and of his reply.FILE COPY \ 4 -£in 1 p. z. 6 (il 4571/28/93) fTS ^ B FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 11th August, 1938 i 1 938 '?z si Dear Gibson, 7 7^3^ In our official letter E 4158/28/93 of the 22nd July you were sent a copy of Baxter’s letter to Houstoun- Boswall at Bagdad about the Sheikh of Koweit’s date garden at Bashiyah. I now enclose a copy of Houstoun-Boswall’s reply. 2. You will see that in paragraph 5 he refers to a despatch from Fowle (No. 407 - S of the 19th July) enclosing a further detailed statement from the Sheikh’s lawyer. I think it will be best if we reserve our final comments on Houstoun-Boswall’s letter until we have seen Fowle’s despatch. 3. There are, however, two subsidiary points that I might make now. The first is that we have now sent off a telegram authorising Houstoun-Boswall to accept the Iraqi redraft of their note about the application of land settlement procedure (paragraph 11). The other is that he/ 12 AUG 1938 J.P. Gibson, Esq.,he does not seem quite fair to Ahmed Rushdi in paragraph 7 (b), since ttia latter in his various memoranda to the Courts did in fact argue the case on its merits as well as deal with the points of international law. 'i' n ~9 a COPY (E 4571/28/93) I' (3/55/53) BY AIR MAIL . British Embassy, Bagdad, 30th July, 1938. jj* 1 i/ijf My dear Baxter, Your letter (E 4158/28/93) of 21st July, about the Shaikh's property called Bashlyah. 2. So far as we can make out from studying the papers, you have got the facts right. There are five surviving daughters of Ali Pasna Zuhair and his wife Shafiqah (who, after the death of Ali Pasha, sold the Bashiyah property to Shaikh Mubarrak in 1909). The daughters names are Rattyah, Bahidah, Najiyah, Wda and Kamila (there were two sons, Hasan and iibddl Baqi, but they died as children). 3. Rafi^ah won a suit in the courts in 1933 for her share of the Bashiyah property to be restored to her. Execution of the dudgment now seems to be taking place (vide Abdul Jalil’s letter of the 7th June enclosed in Powle's despatch No. C/369 of the 25th June, 1938. J — 4. Nadiyah, Hamida and Kamila have now filed similar suits and are going ahead with them (or their lawyers are, because all their rights seem to have been bought up by a group of sasra lawyers as a sort of legal gamble, just as lawyers bought up the rights of the heirs of the Sultan Abdul Hamid). 1 do not think that difficulties about serving documents will stop these cases from proceeding. Action taken on Foreign Office telegram No. 228 of the 1st December, 1937, had no effect and, as you know, the plea that the service of document; on the Shaikh's agent was illegal has not prevented the Basra Courts from going ahead with the case recently brought by Abdullah Zuhair against the Shaikh in connexion with the radaaghiyah property. The last of the five daughters, Bahijab/ c.w. Baxter, esq., m.c.Bahijah, nad apparently given tier share of the property as a security for a debt and the creditor is now foreclosing on the crop. 5. Since you wrote your letter, you have probably received Fowls’s No. 407-S of the 19th July whicn covers a detailed (but not very concise) statement prepared by Abdul Jalil, the Shaikhs lawyer at Basra. This shows that Abdul Baqi (or Baqui), one of the dead brothers of the five sisters mentioned above, also had a share which was sold to Mubarrak; a suit for his share may be put forward by somebody. I cannot say who his heirs are. Possioly his shares all go to the five sisters. 6. Now about giving advice to the Shaikh. This seems to be mainly a job for a lawyer; the case is very complicated and I do not think that any laymen’s opinion on the legal issues would be of much value. Abdul Jalil Partu seems to have appreciated the position pretty well in paragraph 2 and 3 of his abovementioned letter to de Gaury of the 18th June. (Though you will notice that Drower in the note enclosed in our de spatch No. 481 o f the 26th July, 1933 (paragraph l), does not support Jalil*s opinion that the five sisters can also sue the Shaikh for the produce of the Bashiyah date trees). He has three proposals: (a) To fight a legal rearguard action against Bahijaih on the success of which he has little hope. (b) To bank on the Court of Appeal upholding the political pleas of the Shaikh’s lawyers in the Faddaghiyah case and then to fight the Bashiyah claimants with that judgment. (c) lo let Bashiyah go and to recover the purchase price from/from the heirs of Ali Pastia Zuhair and his wife Shafiqah. 7 (a) It seems doubtful whether (a) is worth while, Bahijah s case is not important* The whole Bashiyah property is only about 30 jaribs and Bahijah f s share of this year f s crop cannot be very much. (b) We do not think there is a ghost of a chance of the Court of Appeal taking any notice of the political arguments of waitre Ahmed Rushdi* He would have done far better to have argued the case on its legal points and his enormous fees to my mind were just money thrown down the drain. Anyway, our plan for the Faddaghiyah case is to stop the appeal altogether by having Land Settlement declared and, if we succeed, there will be no Appeal judgment with which to fight the Bashiyah claimants. (c) We are thus left with course (c) which really seems to be the only one to take. B. To sum up, we agree with you that it is no good to try delaying tactics (i.e. anything like trying to persuade the Iraqi Government to intervene and stop court proceedings) and that the only thing the Shaikh can do is to allow the Bashiyah suits to proceed and abide by the results. II he loses the property, he can then institute proceeding to recover the purchase price which would seem to be greater than tne present value of the property i.e. £3,100 as against £1,881 (s ee Humphrys 1 de spatch No, 389 of the 17th June, 1933). 9. The question of whether His Majesty’s Government should pay any compensation for the property can be settled when it is seen now much of the purchase price the Shaikh eventually recovers.10. As to how the Shaikh snould run the case for recovering the purchase money, we would suggest that Brower’s point should he put to Jalil and his advice taken. If his advice cannot he trusted then the Shaikh should appoint another lawyer. H* A propos , I hope you will he ahle to hasten an acceptance 5^2 9 2/ of the formula given in our telegram No. Ill of the 22nd July Ijif — ' about the application of Land Settlement to the Shaikh’s properties. Otherwise, there is a danger of Paddaghiyah going the way of Bashiyah. 12. You suggested more use of the Consul at Basra. Brickell was often consulted, hut he is away, and, if I were to consult Ham., he would only go to Abdul Jalil and get the same views as tnose set out in the latter's letter of the 18th June to de Gaury. There is no British judge there now - Good is on leave. I do not think therefore that it would serve much purpose to consult Harris, unless there is some particular point upon which you want information. 13. If you have any more conundrums, please write. The temperature is about 115 in the shade, but we will do our heat. 14. A final point. You say in your letter that 'there seems to be something of a drive against the Shaikh just now'. I know that things have been happening which give some reason for such an idea but examination of these haopenings reveals quite different causes. The cases of the cutting down of S'S%. s/jSr the date trees and the seizure of a plot of land at f-ao are V nOW 8h0Wn t0 due t0 the activities of the British officials at the Basra Port and nothing really to do with the Iraqi Government/Co-4. Government. 15. The Bashiyah case is notaing new. The lawyers have been having their fun out of it for years and Faddaghiyah is in the same class. 16. Suggestions that the recent revolution in Koweit was due to Iraqi ’propaganda 1 and not to any real Koweiti dissatisfaction with the Shaikh* s misrule seem to me to be tendentious and ill-founded and the story that the Iraqis had put up boundary pillars in Koweiti territory is shown on enquiry to be quite untrue. I?. I think therefore that it would be unfair if the views that the Iraqi Government are organising a drive against Koweit.

II,H. the Shaikh was defended by the laryer Cajid Kuharaiod V. .as5*1, the claim of the plaintiff was dismissed on the ground that a oase should have been Instituted against the legality of the deed of sale before Inctltulng a case for restraining the defendant from preventing the taking of possession by the Plaintiff. She appealed, against this decision, on ».u.l 93 i1931 arA th* Court of Appeal held, in its deoieion \ r o. 148/1931, the deed on vhioh the s^ent of the Shaikh relied needs no institution of a case against its legality as,(due to its being executed out of the Tapu Departuient) it is deeroed non existent. The papers of the suit were returned to the Court c of Instance which re-examined it on 30.12.1931 and issued a Judgenent, t en a for restraining the Shaikh from preventing the said .mfi^h frcw taking jx^ssession of her ahares in the said property. Senrio^ of the said Judgement was male on the lawyer Sayid ( uhanm8d fasfi on 18.2.32 and it was passed on to the Department of Sxooutions and was serv3d on the lawyer Iskander Uandur, who was appointed by Abdul Asia Al-lalia on behalf of the Shaikh with full authority, the lawyer lakaxjder Mansur filed an appetl against this decision which was confirmed on 9th ^4ay 1932 on the ground that sales effected out of the Tapu Depart:r*ent are not recognised and that the second Judgement of the Court of instance is correct, and thus ttie Judgement occawe final. The Court of Instance,at Basra, wanted to serve the Judgeiaent on me, and on ay refusal to accept service the legal procedure, in the face of a refusal, was made against me. Then on S.6.38 Lhe lawyer Sayid Sulaiman Faidhi, on behalf of Kasim bin Abdul Ba^ui Al- .uhaix, obtained an attachment against the share of the 2nd daughter, Bahijah bint -All Pasha Al-Suhair, for the date produce of this years date season of ,l-3ashiyyah, the attachment was effected and a third person was appointed to take possession of the same, ae shares of the other heirs will certainly be attached soon because of the events of this the present Laws of Iraq, there remains no legal course for us to follow in order to avoid the oases of these inheritors, and whoever, among them, wishes to institute a case against us can obtain a Judgment a*$ainst us in the same *ay as was done by their sister iiafi # ah. I also beleive that they can also demand rrom us the value of the date pro.Uioe for a ease.

Although there is little or no hope of suoqsl s 9 yet this is one,,the courses which are open to us, and which ve :3ust, primarily, follow while awaiting the result of the case of Abdulla tl«2uh*\l * and the decision of the Court of Appeal on the Political points of the case. If the Court accepts our contentions on the Political points then we, on behalf of the heirs of Shaikh HUbarak, can contest the case of Hafi f ah from that point, and then we can hold on to this defence against all the other claimants, if the Court decides against us on the olitioal points than we would have no course left except to file a suit against the heirs of Shafikah bint Hafldh for recovery of the value rhioh she had received from the late Shaikh Rub&amp;rak &lt; 1-Gubah, and the attachment of her share and the shsron of her heirs, the claimants in the present case, If we arc able to prove that they have m ■: oive-- any thing from the estate of their mother, th€ id Shitflkehi The course which we should taxe in this case is Usual eudlns.V I 5177 1 ^ l PORTION OFFICE, S..V. 1. 2l8t July, 1938. ' &gt; v Ky dear Houstoun-Boewall, * Will you please refer to Bushire deapa,tgjj&gt;V No. C/369 of the 25th June enclosing copies of correspondence from the Sheikh of Koweit and others about / j&lt;??i it-o xif. - the date gardens at Bashiyah. I see that Fowle’s « telegrams Nos. 239 and 240 of the 9 th June we re repeated to you at the time, but I enclose herein copies of certain further telegrams between the India Office and the Gulf which you do not seem to have had yet. The India Office have asked for our views as to the advice to be given the Sheikh, but we are up against an initial difficulty because we are not even clear what the facts really are. In de Gaury f s telegram of the 27th June, it is stated that a lady by name Bahija, one of the heirs to the original vendors of the property, has had 'her share' attached for a aebt by her to another member of the family, although she has not 'filed a suit'. W.B. Houstoun-Boswall, Ksq. , Bagdad.j presumably against the Sheikh. In his telegram of the 12th July, however, Fowle states that three more heirs have 1% obtained attachments against the Sheikh’s property, like Hafiya and Bahija. Clearly, if Bahija has not filed a suit against the Sheikh, she cannot have got an attachment oraer against him. If, as we suopose, the information in the enclosure in Bagdad despatch No. 70 (230/2/36) of the Q ebruary, 1936, is correct, Banijn has in iact filea a from the letter from the Sheikh’s lawyer at Basra to the bheikh’s son (fourth enclosure in Bushire despatch under reference that what Bahija has done is not to secure an attachment order against the Sheikh, but something qiite different. to a twelfth part of the property, but has apparently not yet taken any steps to get possession. against the Sheikh, but (although this is a doubtful point) have still not been able to make any progress. (3) If they could effect the service of the necessary documents on the Sheikh, they could without difficulty. l 2 4 . 33 / suit against the Sheikh, but in any case it would appear The facts as far as we can make out are as follows: (l) One heir, Rafiya, established her right in 1933 (2) The majority of the other heirs have filed suits likelike Rafiya, establish their claims to their shares of the property, and (4) Bahija has now thought of an ingenious way roind the service difficulty; another member of the family, to whom she is 'indebted', applies to the courts for an attachment on her share of the property. 4s she has a valid title deed to the property and does not defend the case, the court takes action as requested, unless the Sheikh intervenes. The sheikh cannot, however, intervene with any prospect of success, as the transfer of property to him in the first place was invalid, i.e. in manoeuvring he SheiKh out of the position of defendant, she has managed to get the issue before the courts. However, as I have said above, a good deal of this is only guess—work,and we should be gratelul ii you could enquiries and let us know as soon as possible what the facts really are. Incidentally, it occurs to me that it might be most useful if the consulate at Basra were brought into the matter to a greater extent than has, I think, been the case in the past* There seems to be something °f a drive against the Sheikh just now, and reports from the Consulate on all developmentsdevelopments might be a valuable supplement to the information that we get via the Sheikh, We should also be glad to have any comments that you can make as to the advice to be given to the Sheikh on the matter in hand. Our own impressions, which of course may have to be readjusted when we get your report about the real position, can be summarised as follows:- (2) delaying tactics, even if possible, would seem to serve little or no useful purpose,since whatever the result of the land settlement procedure in the case of the Sheikh’s other properties may be, assuming that it was ever applied, in the case of the 3ashiya property at least it can do nothing for him, and the Sheikh can do is to hand over the estate and claim the purchase money back. If this is so, the sooner he starts his counter-claim the better. prower held, however, (cf. enclosure in your despatch No. 461 (159/48/53) of the 26th Gswct (l) As the Sheikh’s title to the Bashiya property is intervene in any way. (3) It appears that ultimately the only thing that 5~ 3 2 (&gt; July 1933) that the Iraqi courts could not hear such a claim 33 ~ Coe. ~s. until(•&lt;£) unt^l judgment had been given against the Sheikh on the question ox ownership. Paradoxical though it sounds, it looks therefore as though what the Sheikh now needs is a judgment in the Iraqi courts that the land does not belong to him, and if so his best course might be to intervene in the present court proceedings, not in the hope that they might be decided in his favour, since that is apparently impossible, or with a view to gaining time, but in order to get a definite ruling from the court on which he could base hie counter-claim.
