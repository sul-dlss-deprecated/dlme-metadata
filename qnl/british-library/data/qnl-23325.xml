After Compliments, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.911 dated 6th August namely of today’s date in which your excellency informed that LIr.Shewakram could not get the weighing comittee to weigh a consignment of rice whicA he has received and that when one member is available the ot\i€\ could not be found. I beg to inform your excellency that there is no ground for the comolaint of the aforesaid nerson, which made by hiin against the Baladiyafr and their members is a mere 'fabrication and false communicatioi/. He dia not at all go to the official incharge of weighing cereals at the Customs shed neither did he go to any of the members of the inspecting comittee or even come to the Baladiyah office. VHien I got your letter I asked the man in charge of weighing and also from seth Xakumal Valabdas if he (LIr.Shev.rakram) had received any rice and they delayed wieghin* I it or if he had brought them his delivery order. In reply they said that he did not do so and that he has lied. In a formal way I asked Mr.Nakumal Valabdas and he has replied me in writing, which is attached. Under the circumstances the Baladiyah cannot keep quiet and forego their right, after this man has tried to spoil their name without any justification and they(Balacliyaly are ready to prosecute the said person before your excellency U.E.

I have therefore informed them that I will not en force the order of the Baladiyyah against .hem for a space of three months from th- date of the order, and thay have accepted this period as sufficient to close their mamfcxa transactions in this commodity.

I have received a long countercomplaint from the Baladiyyah against Mr. Shewakram who stated that he was unable to get the subcommittee to weigh his rice. This countercomplaint forwards a very lengthy screed from one of the members, Mr. Kakumal Yallabhdas, in which he states that Mr. Shewakram never approach^ him at all, and made his statement solely with the intention to 'degrade' him.

As regards Margarine and Cocos Butters, there is no demand herej also for the edible oils of Soya Bean and sunflower. The edible oils of cottonseed, coconut, Palm kernel, and Groundnuts, are imported from Bombay, Karachi, and Verav/al, by Messrs Muhummad Hajy Adam, Yusuf Hajy Hashim Maklai (Memmons), and Aly bin Zubeiry (Arab), in no great quantatiee, but sufficient for the demand.

Dear Sir, He are very much obliged for your letter dated 9th October, and also for the information which you enclosed. Ve note that large consignments of Vegetable Product have been held up by the Customs,and as it may possibly be of interest to you to enquire further into the causes of this action, ve take the opportunity to submit the following notes, by way of comparison between Vegetable Product and Natural 'Animal* Ghee, from three standpoints viz -1. Bacteriological Purity, 2. Vitamin Content, and 3* Combustion Value - 1. From a bacteriologicalpoint of view, a properly made Vegetable Product is superior to the Natural Product. It is usually manufactured in a factory where the hygienic arrangements have received consideration for many years, and the latest developments of modem business science are applied so as to ensure the absolute purity and cleanliness of the article, whereas natural Ghee made even from milk of a- 2 - The British Consul* cotnparatIvely standard, belnr 7 : normally produced in a farmyard, is more liable to absorb undesirable bacteria than is the artifical Product, made in a factory specially built for the purpose. But in many cases natural Qhee has been proved to have been obtained from ill-nurtured and even diseased animals. VITA IH CQKTLST. It has been argued that natural Ghee ^ although inferior in vitaminic activity to butter in this country, is superior to the Vegetable Product, and that of /-v the different vitamins Natural Ghee may contain Vitamin A (growth promoting factor) Vitamin 0 (antirachitic factor) But on further investigating these two vitamins it has been found arith regard to VITAhIU A . rancid fats do not contain Wit amin A and further that when supplied to the body they destroy all traces of this Vitamin which may have been present in other foods. Therefore, in view of the fact that Natural Ghee is as a rule more or less rancid, there is no advantage in consuming it as far as ^itfjnin A is concerned, in fact rather the reverse. As regards VITA?/IN D. which is produced bythe ultra violet rays on a body and on the food, we may conclude that in countries where sunshine is very abundant there is little fear of there being a lack of this Vitamin in the human body. Up to the present time a quantitative estimate of the Vitamins is impossible; science has not advanced further than to answer, fter ic expensive experiment-3- Yhe British Consul the question 'which of two products contains more Vitamins than the other, and whether a Vitamin is present or not.' However, it has been proved that the above Vitamins A and 0 are completely destroyed by the fat being heated; both Natural Ghee and Vegetable Product are heated to a high temperature when used in cooking, and they are not, or hardly at all, use! in a raw state. The result of the heating is that in neither article are there any Vitamins left by the time they are consumed. Natural Ghee and Vegetable Product are, therefore, as far as these two Vitamins are concerned, on an equal footing. However, it has recently been discovered that Vegetable Product contains a valuable Vitamin, not present in Natural Ghee, namely Vitamin E(reproductive factor). This Vitamin is not destroyed by heating; it appears only in Vegetable Oils and Fats and is present also after hydrogenation. Natural Ghee and Vegetable Product, we find that this important factor of energy is foremost in the latter product, in that it contains a higher fat percentage. The digestibility of all fate is practically the same (97 to 100/) provided that the melting point of the fat mixture is not much higher than the body temperature. Vegetable Product, however, necessarily contains a higher fat percentage than Natural Ghee in that it is free from I CQ..Y3UJl^ VALU£. &gt;¥lth regard to the combustion values of all moistureThe British Consul From these comparisons it oan be seen that on scientific grounds. Vegetable Product is superior even to the best available grades of the Natural Product. In conclusion we would add that were the sale of Margarine (now rising to 30,000 tons per week) prohibited iir iXirope, a very much increased demand for Butter would ensue, resulting in prohibitive prices to the poorer clashes, who would find its purchase even further beyond their reach than at the present time. In the sa/ e Vegetable Product provides a necessity in the form of a pure fat at modest prices ootalnable by even the poorest of the population. And again, '*ere the sale of Vegetable Product tc be prohibited the rising prices of the Natural article would prove an added temptation to dishonest dealers to adulterate it r?ith cheap mineral Oils and carcass fats, the former being detrimental to the health, and the Istt r objectionable to various casten. should be much obliged if you would be o good as to oass this letter on to the Political © e .t, Bahrein, with ou|t assurance that we should be glad to arrange for sarp'fes of Vegetable Product to be submitted by one of the manufacturers controlled by this company, further, that all these 1-anufsoturers are prepared to .guarantee Vegetable Product shipped by them to be free from f ineral Oils or carcass fats, in fact all foreign matter other than refined and deodorised vegeta le fats and oils. ^e should also be pleased to submit Leaflets enumerating the above points for circulation, if desired, and would be glad to have your advice as to how this might best be accomplished.

Import of vegetable ghee was prohibited by Bahrain Government f s decree No.59b/l7 of 2nd October 1929, which is still in force. Similar prohibition exists in Persia. It is due to adulteration of natural ghee with imported product, which cannot be detected and is held to decrease nntrive value of natural ghee. I have already approached Bahrain Government to procure abrogation of prohibition on behalf of British trading concern Margarine Union, Limited, but without effect, and am disinclined to exercise further pressure on Shaikh on behalf of foreign interests.

With reference to your despatch Bo.49/797 of April 1st last. I aa directed to inform you that enquiries hare been made of the Director of the Sanitation Service regarding the attitude of the Oorernment towards the importation of vegetable oils into Persia. Pr.lughman ul Mulk stated that the Government maintained their views in this regard and did not propose to remove the ban on imported vegetable oils. These were used for adulteration with Persian oils and were considered injurious to the health of the population. It was thought preferable not to tell T&gt;r. lughm&amp;n ul Mulk that ghee was being freely imported into His Majesty's Consul General, BUSEIBS.into Bandar Abtoaa as instructions would probably bare been immediately issued to put a stop to the practice* — I enclose a spare copy of this despatch for transmission to the Political Agent, Bahrein* I am 9 Sir 9 Tour most obedient berrant /-N L R.

The claim is, I fear, one ..hich is in itself legitimate and cannot be resisted. The Shaikh of Bahrein ( like the Sheikh of Kuwait or the Sultan cf Mu sc at} is within his rights in refusing to exempt Royal Air force stores fro• import lues if he thinks fit and the natter f. one on which it vculd b- difficult M .pply pr^^sure C T ion 1 ticn, cases are not- paite parallel, th.M the F -ench Government recently pretested vigorously against an order of the Shaikh prohibiting tl.e import cf vegetable 0 hi into 3a.ire in The Government of India were asked to investigate the case and reported that the prohibition vas one ..hich equally affected British traders, and that it had not seen to secure its modification in their favour and that in these circumstances they suggested that we should reply to the- french that we were unable to intervene either on their behalf or our own. This course we have now reccmmen ..ed to t ie foreign Office) r the same time, it is possible that in the present case tactful representations by the Meal Air force Authorities to the Financial Adviser.in fahrein might result in the Air force securing some concession .o an act cf grace, though we cannot express an opinion as to the probability of this and you i dght think it 'worth .vnile cUggesting to them thatthey should take counsel ;/ith the uoiittoal Resident, ,;hc is in the best position to advise in the matter. If, however, the financial Adviser is obdurate and the Bahrein hols eminent refuse to make any concession, T fear it vill hardly be possible to take things further, no doubt in that event the fact that Bahrein revenues would benefit/to some small extent by the import dues l-'n -ed may, as suggested in your official letter, have a beneficial political result locally.

I suggest that the Blatter should be discussed again as the position at present is absurd. The reason for all this trouble is to prevent cheating. I think that each person himself should protect himsslf against being cheated and that the Bala- h oT ° 0 diya should interfere in these matters A of trade until persons make comlaints# If any person finds that he has bought mixed ghee when he paid for pure ghee he can make a criminal case against the seller for cheating. In this connection I would remark that the restrictions on ghee in Irak and elsewhere are connected with the efforts of those Governments to Increase their own production of ghee by keeping out foreign imports. The artificial gheo does noir bars to the health and it is not right that those people who cannot afford to buy the pure ghee should be forced by the Baladiy* to ge hungry without any ghee.
