The Shaikh seemed to be in i - extremely good form and bubbling over with the success of oil developments in his State, the apparel and ornaments of his entourage gave visible proof of this. He spoke of internal adminis,- trative developments in the Kuwait State, comparing Kuwait to Muscat much to the latter*s detriment. I reminded him that Muscat has not yet struck oil which led him to talk about oil developments in the Trucial Coast, remarking that it was going to be a terrible business to settle the boundaries of the various Shaikhdoms.

President, Municipal Council, called on the Political A^ent to discuss the Municipal affairs. Be said that the Municipality had devoted its chief^attention during recent months to cleaning up Muscat, ne saia that he had progressed as far as he could with the work in Muscat and now proposed to divert his attention to Mutrah where there was much to be done.. He added that sanitary affairs in Mutrah had been neglected for a considerable period and that he anticipated certain obstruction. In this connection he stated that there should be no differentiation between Muscat subjects and British subjects, and asked for my support, should he meet with obstruction from the British subjects. He said he particularly anticipated difficulty with the Khoja community who all live in one separate enclosed area. This area, he stated, had never been penetrated by Public Health Inspectors and was, he understood, in a deplorably insanitary condition. I agree in principle that if British subjects or British Protected Persons fail to comply with public health, instructions, they should- not hy oealt with more leniently by the Consulate Court tho.n Muscat subjects by the t&gt;tate courts. I advised, however, that he should take his fences slowly and said that I would like to be given plenty of previous notice of anv s eps he proposes to take in regard to the Khoja community 's enclosed area. I suggested that any such action should ^ .1 be • ••••••'•' a 'ie 'p ifd 5 EXT -3- be taken in conjunction with jthg eTdara the Khoja community rather than by individual Public Health Inspectors. While it is probably true that the Khoja community 1 s area is in a deplorably insanitary con dition, it is unlikely that it is much worse than any other part of Mutrah and since, it would un doubtedly cause considerable heart-burning if the Municipality devoted undue attention to them, I shall endeavour to see that Saiyid Tarik moves very slowly in the matter. The Khoja community had impressed me, within the short period I have been here, as being somewhat more surly and discontented than the other British communities. I have not yet been able to find out the cause for this. GWADUR . 388. Mr. K.R.
