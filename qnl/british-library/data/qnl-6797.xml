O JL Y No. G.O. Sir, Headquarters, Aden, At the present time it appears that the Slieihf^of^ Vfei sfsss* .‘arrs** 1 S'i™fv:“n‘ h ' “ d ‘ h - .«:r.rS” Jhe object of this note is to discuss the possible effects of such disturbances on our position in Aden and &gt;V- ir *. i i • , of su . reference to the possible action of the Turks. * 'i ( r an* , with special the Sherif’sEfforts!^ W ' 11 Va ° 111 accnrdailce u 'Uli the degree of success of Tor instance : — (1) He may foil to obtain any support amongst his own people or amongst the other tribes.

But, with reference to the \den I,nterland, the necessity of obtaining a sound and strategic and political land frontier may bring ns into direct contact with the Imam. 1 4. In case of (1) the situation opposite Aden would not be materially anged, except perhaps that the lurks might receive more support from faTlm™ ^ 111 genera aU ' fr ° m the Imam in ParHcular, if tl le Sherif proves a a failure 6 86,6048 h ‘ 8 ,ime VTe11 ’ tllere sh ould be small chance of such t . ^ At P r ® sent tl,e Wp; ploughing a lonely furrow, but, when the Mien rises there seems little reason to doubt that the Idrisi would have ik) gieat difficulty in winning over to his side some of the Imam’s fightinir tribes. 55 ® Assisted by our supplies of ammunition, he would then be in a good position lor fighting the 1 urks now opposing him, even though in this case they might perhaps receive aid from the Imam. If the Idrisi met with success, the Turks would probably draw on their forces, in front of Aden, and by so doing might be able to overcome the Ldnsi s offensive. 1 he question then arises as to the role to be adopted by onr Aden force. It seems to me that this is a question deserving early consideration. Are we to sit still and permit the Turks to withdraw forces from here to rein force those lighting against the Idrisi ? Or shall we be permitted to attack the'Turkish force in front of Aden as soon ns it becomes ieduced to &lt;i certciiii minimum stren^tli? If the latter, it would seem advisable that this possibility should be recognised and instructions issued accordingly; that all preparations for such a move should be complete ; and that a carefullv considered scheme should be ready and practised. It appears, from the Sherif s note, that his plans should mature early in dune and should they do so, there may be not much time to lose. It seems possible, however, that the fall of Kut may delay their inauguration, and it seems more than likely that nothing will occur this side of the Ramzan Id S 312 20 -6 1916iii August. The reasons why we should attack the Turks if they attemnt retire or to reduce the strength of their force here below a certain ininim t0 seem to be as follows 11111 (°) To fulfil our moral obligation to the Idrisi and to prevent him fr, being crushed. 0111 (b) To assume the right to advance to our delimited frontier This ri ht would certainly lapse in the eyes of all the Arabs, including the Imam, it we allow the lurks to retire under pressure from thl Arabs alone. ie fi. If, as in (;&gt;), the Idrisi and the Imam unite their whole streimth against the Turks, it is thought that they -would have little difficult/in putting an end to the Turkish army gf the Yemen. ^ In this caso the Turkish force in front of Aden would either be called away to fall a prey to the Arabs, or would surrender to us. Unless the Turks were to surrender to us, and not to the Arabs, the Imam would be entitled to advance a claim, which we should find it difficult to oppose, to take over the whole of the country administered by the 'lurks In the absence of any show of strength on our part, he would take over the whole country now occupied by the Turks as far as Abyah and the I ahei district up to our Sheikh-Othman outposts. 1 ^ It appears to me that the process of ejecting him from Lahej and across the old frontier would be, under the circumstances, a difficult and Wthv military operation, and politically unpopular. ° ^ It certainly could hardly he undertaken until I he end of the war had put an end to all apprehension of the results of a jehad. 1 . . In °I der |° i \ V0 . i(J th e chance of such an intrusion by the Imam into the Aden iimterland. it appears advisable that we should be able to meet him at 1 aiz with a force sufficient to stop his further progress. Hut, owing to the exigencies of the present war, we mav not be able to arrange this. The next best arrangement, in order to avoid such a chance, would be or oui force at Aden to assume a more active defensive attitude; and to be prepared to advance m force against the Turks and cut off their retirement towards the passes north of Lahej. It is fully recognised that, under present instructions, it is essential that the Aden force should refrain from all risk of becoming entangled with the J 'Iks m such a way as to necessitate reinforcements being sent to extricate them from any such entanglement. In endeavouring to make clear the reasons for my opinion that a com paratively msigniheant display of force in season may save the future these ^nitructhnis ' ^ lorce ’ 1 not wish to appear to question nf tPp q ^bL eais » ^ roi n the Idrisi s last letter, that lie does not think much thm L^ T 3 ° f - the n lei \ f b r mg able to throw off tlie Turkish yoke; and and tip ° c T mi0T l * Imam is bound to the 'Turks by his agreement ana the money received thereby. an f judgment be correct, there appears to be little chance of any immediate Arab rising against the Turk. tori^r r3t °.^ eVen J esschai *- of the T nrks inducing the Arabs qn I'U us m 10 n ^. ar future, although they are preaching a jehad. inauo-uratpd S iT &lt;)n '\ aitln p 111111 * a ''i^ing against the 'Turk can be safely much as thpv ecail \’ e 1 u 'y the Turkish reign of law and order as much as they resent the loss of their liberty. successes mightVvcTtC WaUto ^ Tlirkish ’ ^ German ’ r Ihpv nt-p ii-o v • e a ? to jeconsi&lt; J ei ‘ their present attitude, victories com J ^Vi' 1 our vlclor i°« in other fields.

S. .Therefore, in my opinion we should advance to Lahej at an early date m such a way (as I believe is quite possible) that the Turks cannot escape northwards. (I do not at present advocate any advance beyond the Lahei delta.) J To do this at the moment without risk of failure, it is first needful to add two modern field batteries and two sound infantry battalions, with as many mounted cavalry as Somaliland can loan temporarily, to the Aden horce, for the space of a lortnight, to make the whole force mobile, and to have the rails necessary for the lb miles of line to Lahej. 9. ] am well aware that the decision in this matter will be made on the basis of the strategical requirements of the Empire. I have concerned myself only in attempting to make clear the local situation, political and military, as it appears to me at the present moment, and to indicate future possibilities.
