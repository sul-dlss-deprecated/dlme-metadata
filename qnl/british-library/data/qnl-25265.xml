[54206] India Office to Form Sii-j India Office, December ] 8 , 1912. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, on the subject of reported plague in Afghanistan. From the Meshed consular diaries recently received it would appear probable that the rumour originated in the death of some inhabitants of Karez from eating the flesh of a camel that bad died from poison ; and the Marquess of Crewe is of opinion that it is being utilised by the Russian authorities for the purpose of strengthening their hold upon the portions of Persia bordering on Afghanistan. In this connection I am to advert to the representations which his Lordship has from time to time made regarding the dangers inherent in the continued Russian occupation of north-east Khorasan, and to call attention to the accumulating evidence of a more active policy on the part of the Russian Government in relation to Afghanistan. A railway along the Oxus to Termez has been long under discussion, surveys have been conducted, and the alignment apparently settled. This railway has been represented in the Russian press as mainly strategical; and it is noteworthy that material for the construction of a bridge has, during the summer, been sent up the Oxus from Charjui, and was expected to be collected at Termez before the river was closed in the autumn. One end of a bridge at this point must be in Afghan territory. On the western frontier of Afghanistan the Russians have established a military post at Karez. Cossacks have been sent to Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam, and reports of frontier fracas and arrests for suspected espionage have greatly increased in frequency. Even if without foundation, these reports indicate a state of expectation which might easily give rise to a frontier incident of embarrassing dimensions. Simultaneously, as the Government of India pointed out in the telegram dated the 29th November, copy of which was enclosed in my letter of the 10th December, the Russian Government have exhibited a marked diplomatic interest in Afghanistan, and have been endeavouring apparently to draw the Amir into those direct relations with themselves which it is a matter of common knowledge that he cannot tolerate. These facts taken together appear to Lord Crewe to indicate the probability that at some time in the near future the Russian Government may directly raise the qnestion of Afghan acceptance of the Anglo-Russian convention, and may even follow up this move by action on the frontier of an even more deiinite nature. He would therefore suggest that an early opportunity should be taken of representing to them the misgivings with which His Majesty’s Government regard recent developments in those regions. I am to add that the return of Prince Dabija to Meshed, which appears to be imminent, is not likely to lead to any reduction of Russian activity in Khorasan. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HOLDERNESS. [December 19.J Section 2. No. 1 . yn Office .— {Received December 19.) Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from Meshed Consular Diary. The Plague Scare .—M. Leleux, some days ago, heard from his agent at Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam that there was some mysterious disease in the neighbourhood. He sent an alarmist telegram to Tehran, and the conseil sanitaire, without reference to the European doctors at Meshed, apparently declared that it was plague. Mv colleague received orders to act with vigour, and sent Cossacks to stop all traffic [2728 2 ]2 with the result that there were soon hundreds of stair in g pilgrims. He then cancelled the order. I was awaiting a report from the agent at Ivaiez, who stated that twelve people ate a camel wdiich was dying from poison. Ihey natuially died. A further report is expected from the llussian doctor at Harez, and a lersian doctor is heing^pi dispatched from Meshed. The Itussian Consulate has ashed the' agency surgeon to send for some plague serum from Bombay. P. M. Sykes, Major. 485. Termez Railway. —IVo alignments are being surveyed : one vih Charjui and Kerki, and the other via Bokhara and Karshi (see Diary I\o. 31, paragraph 372). The “ lloseiya ” does not consider that the line w r ill materially promote Pvussian trade interests, although some increase may be expected in trade with Afghanistan. 492. Termez Railway. —The alignment proposed from Kaghan, near Bokhara, would run via Karshi to Kerki and thence up the left bank of the Oxus, via Kilif, to Termez. Total length, 310 miles, with a branch line of 80 miles to Guzar and Kitab, from Karshi. 33?. Oxus Bridge—The report that large quantities pf bridging material have been shipped upstream from Charjui is confirmed. 620 iron floats (for a pontoon bridge) w r ere reported to be still at Charjui on 8 th July. Each float is 15 feet long, with a circumference of 6 feet. The destination of all bridging material is said to be Pata Kisar (Termez). 352. Oxus Bridge .—The arrival of iron and w r ooden material for a floating bridge is reported from Termez. 374. Oxus Bridge. —The dispatch of heavy bridging material from Charjui to Termez continues. 410. Oxus Bridge. —The dispatch of bridging material from Charjui to Termez continues. 445. Termez. —Eight Maxims have been received. The dispatch of considerable quantities of ammunition to this post continues. The garrison has, however, not been reinforced. It appears that the wliole of the material for the floating bridge w r ill be collected at Termez before the Oxus is closed to navigation this autumn. 497. Rumoured Outbreak of Plague. —A report, apparently unfounded, that jfiague has appeared at Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam has caused much alarm among the Bussian authorities. On 10th October, 1912, Cossacks w r ere hurriedly dispatched to close the road leading to Meshed from that place. The llussian doctor at Karez lias been ordered to investigate. 372. Termez Railway .—A party headed by engineer Andreef is about to make a reconnaissance for the Termez Bailway. Katta Kurghan appears to be the best point for the line to leave the Central Asian Bailway. 25,000 tons of raw cotton and 10,000 tons of wdieat are dispatched from this station in good years. The engineering difficulties between Katta Kurghan and Karshi are slight, wTiereas, if the line commences from Juma, the alignment wdll meet mounds and, if from Khagan, there are both mounds and hills to be faced. 401. Reconnaissance .—The mounted scout detachment of the 18th Turkistan Bifle Begiment has left to carry out an extended reconnaissance in continuation of a scheme of reconnaissances for the purpose of improving existing Bussian maps of Khorasan. Boute : Meshed—mountains north-east of Kuchan—Gaudan— Shirwan—Bujnurd, which will be reached about 5th September. The detachment will rejoin its regiment at Askhabad via Bobat. No reconnaissances have been carried out recently to the south or south-east from Meshed. The Persian Governor of Bakharz has been warned that a party of two officers, twenty-five Cossacks, and seven guns [? Maxim] will shortly pass through his district. Bole by Military Attache. —The Bussians have already a small post at Karez, on the Herat road, in the Bakharz district. It is not known if the present is a movement in relief or a reconnaissance.(J) P XThis Documeat is the Property of Hia Britannic Majesty's Govexjuaent.] I SPOKE to the Russian Ambassador to-day about the way in which the Russian press was representing us as having obstructed M. Sazonof’s policy in the Near East, through fear of offending Mussulman susceptibilities. I said that, as the Ambassador would remember, I had not opposed any proposals which M. Sazonof had made ; and, though I had spoken of the sensitiveness of Mussulman opinion, and had asked M. Sazonof not to make things difficult for us by action which must offend it, this had been in connection with Persia, especially the bombardment of the shrine at Meshed. The Ambassador did not differ from anything which I had said, and observed that he had been present, and remembered very well that my remarks had applied to Persia. He said that the -Russian press just now was attacking M. Sazonof, and he feared that there was a combination of the extreme Right and the Radicals to assail r [A] CONFIDENTIAL. PERSIA.

He gave 24th June, strict instructions to his officers not to have anything to do with us : and one of his officers took advantage of his absence to inform Captain Blair of this. The Cartoon of the Bombardment. —The cartoonist ’ was' examined by my col- 25th June, league and the General, and Swore that he had no connexion with this Consu late-General. He tried to prove that the cartoon conveyed a sense of the power and might of Russia. He was subsequently released. The return of the Agazada,—The notorious Agazada, son of the late Aga Kazim 27 th June of Najaf, is returning to Meshed, where he makes much money. The Ttepair of the Bhrine. —The Governor-General has agreed to pay my col- 28 th June, league 20,000 tomans for the repair of the Shrine, which will be done by him. The Governor-General says that as there is no Government at Tehran* he is bound to be the slave of the Russians. The Russian Cantonment.—2 ,000 planks and 500 beams have, go far, been 29 th Juno, purchased by the Russians for their buildings. Political Summary. State of the Province,—The event of the week has been the access to the cor respondence of the late Yusuf by the very able Attache. The most important letters were two written by the Sipahdar to Yusuf. One of these was handed over in original, and the other was read and copied. These documents tend to show that the Russian Legation, if not the Russian Government, were intriguing an favour of the ex-Shah, and that my colleague was not disobeying orders with out instructions to do so. This is so usual a form of Russian slimness that it need occasion no surprise. I am writing a special report on the subject. With reference to the two documents of Yusuf which are missing (see summary of diary No, 22, paragraph 2), one of them, I am informed by a reliable witness, runs to the effact that Yusuf will be given (i rank ” for his services. The Mamur also showed the Attache a letter written to his father-in-law, with instructions to his wife, about the correspondence containing theRussian instructions, ” and the letters from the ex-Shah. The notorious Muavin-u-Tujjar, Haji Husezn Aga and others have petitioned my colleague to the effect that since the abolition of martial law, there is no safety in Meshed. This petition has been telegraphed to Tehran. My colleague has been bribing at St. Petersburg, sending the emeralds and rubies, which he received as part of his share of the loot, 1 now hear that he is being allowed to stay on for another five months, so persuasive have been his argu ments. Movements of Russian iroops.-—The question of sending a sotnia to Sistan was f reported by me to Tehran, and the Russian Minister assured the British Legation that only reliefs for escorts could be intended. He evidently inquired from Meshed, as my colleague and the General were much upset at their secret having leaked out, and there was a hunt for spies, one non-commissioned officer being arrested on suspicion. Incidentally, this excitement corroborates the accuracy of the report, and I only trust that our sources of information will not dry up. A Russian force has been destroying two villages and some crops, near Chaacfia and Kalat-i-Nadiri. The reason given is that the Persians have comsumed more than then just share of water, a variation of the proverb of the wolf and theG. M. Press, Simla.^ T o. C-306 P. 1-8.12.—M.-H.C.S.L. 2 There are constant complaints of Russian soldiers breaking into gardens and robbing fruit : they also rob cucumbers and forage. Occasionally, they molest women. A rumour has reached me that 1,000 more troops are under orders for Meshed, I am not inclined to believe this. State of the Roads.—The road to Karez is safer than before, owing to action taken by the Governor-General. An employe of this Consulate-General has just returned from Mecca and Kerbala. He is lucky to have escaped with being repeatedly robbed. He states that he was often refused bread as being a Kkora* eani, owing to the feeling which exists about the bombardment. P, M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty’s Consul-General iCONFIDENTIAL. r fro:'.! For'’ , date! 8 AUG Meshed Consular Diary, No. 27, for the week ending 6th July (received 2nd August) 1912. The arrival of the Agazadcu —With reference to entry of 27th June, the Aga- zada has reached Meshed. He was met by sowars and policemen, and escorted in triumph to his house. The repair of the Shrine. —The Neiir-u-Dola convened a meeting on the sub ject of the repairs of the Shrine, and spoke very strongly to the Kaim Makam, and other leading officials, who had supported Yusuf. He tells me that he has deposit ed 20,000 tomans in the Russian Bank, to begin with, and will receive a weekly account of the sums expended, in order to prove what has actually been expended. If the money was expended in any other way, the Russian Government would refuse to beheve that it had been expended. The Governor-General on Sistan and Kain. —The Governor^-General informed me that he intended to make over both Sistan and Kain to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, on condition that he would be responsible for all robberies. He said that the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, although a good ruler, could not hold Kain against his cousin. He asked me to keep the matter confidential. He added that the action of the Customs in attempting to collect the revenue in Sistan was sure to end in trouble. He considers that M. Leleux, who is in charge of the revenue of Khorasan, is in the hands of his staff, as he does not know a word o'f Persian, and that there will be trouble locally on this account. POLITICAL SUMMARY. The Governor-General has shown distinct enterprise in seizing and deporting the three brothers, the Muavin-u-Tuj jar, the Muin-u-Tujjar and Haji Abdur Rahim. As they are of Aghan descent, he first asked me if I had any objection: but, as they are extremely mischievous individuals and are always intriguing, I replied that I would not intervene. The Russian Attache has interceded for them, as he has apparently been promised 2,0G0 tomans, if successful: but the Governor- General said that either they must go or himself. With reference to entry in summary of last diary regarding Russian action near Chaacha, I hear on good authority that the Russian Pristav is now reaping the crops on the Persian side of the frontier, and sending them to Kaakha to be sold. State of road. —Huseinzada, who surrendered to the Neiir-u-Dola, and who was released by him, is now at Miandasht, between Shahrud and Sabzawar, and is robbing passers-by. The Governor-General is working hard to restore security on the road to Herat. Movements of Russian Troops.—It is reported that a Russian detachment of Russian troops has been sent to Damghan. General Redko has returned from Kuchan. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Britannic Majesty 1 s](Jonsul-Generah G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C-319 F.

Break-down gangs with 200 workmen were on the scene and it was hoped to reopen the line to traffic by 8 p.m. on 12th June 1912. 302. Proposed Tashkend-Pskent branch. — A petition has been presented to the Governor-General asking for the construction of this branch line. The Turkis- tan Agricultural Society is collecting statistical information in order to support the case for the construction of the railway. | 303. Khiva railway. —Kovalevski, an engineer who was previously employed on the construction of the Tashkend railway and of the Namangan branch, will commence surveys for the Khiva railway in August. The line will probably run from some station on the Tashkend railway, near Aralskoe More, to Khiva. 304. Civil Hospitals. —Hospitals are to be built during 1912 at Izbaskent (Andijan District), Sharikhan (Skobolef District), and Russkie (Skobolef District). In each case the estimated cost of construction is about £3,000. « 305. Aralskoe More. —The population of the village near the railway station of this name is stated to be several thousands. Telegrams to the value of £300 are despatched yearly and the village now requires a proper Post and Telegraph Office. 30G. Storm at Askhabad. —Much damage was done by a heavy rain-storm at Askhabad on 22nd June 1912. The telephone system of the town was out of order for two days. 307. Afghan news. —It is reported that large quantities of ammunition have recently reached Herat from Kabul. The Amir has ordered the metalling of the Kandahar-Herat road and it is rumoured that he will visit Herat in September. Feeling against the Russians on account of the bombardment of the Meshed Shrine is still very strong. 308. Projected Russian cantonment at Meshed. —The Civil Engineer whose arrival was reported last week and General Redko inspected sites for barracks near Kuh-i-Sangi. The former has now returned to Askhabad. The 200 large beams, mentioned in Diary No. 24, paragraph 277, are still lying in the shop from which they were ordered. No work of any description has been commenced on the ground. 309. Meshed garrison. —Officers’ patrols continue to carry out reconnaissances in the neighbourhood of Meshed. The troops are proceeding with their ordinary peace training : on 3rd June 1912 the Kuban Cossack Battery practised with live shell near Kuh-i-Sangi. GENERAL SUMMARY, Communications, Administration.

GENERAL. State of Provinces .—Nothing of importance has occurred during the week. The question of the Governorship of Kain does not seem to be settled yet. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk is still in Sistan, but is anxious to be off to the Kainat. Haji Nasir-es-Sultaneh, I hear, intends to go to Birjand soon, but, before doing so, con templates making a trip along the frontier here.’ This officer has not yet arranged a settlement of our outstanding claims against the Persian Government. Sistani LasA/car.—Sirdar Khudadad Khan is expected here in a few days. He has only about 70 sowars and sarbazes with him now, the others having re turned owing to scarcity of rations and water. He has not been successful, I under stand, in retrieving the letter which the Hashmat-ul-Mulk wrote to Sirdar Jehind, asking him to go to pillage in Kain. He has, however, succeeded in collecting a considerable number of sheep, for the Hashmat and himself, which he has sent to his village, Khwaja Ahmad ; he has also collected some camels, money, guns, etc. Robberies.—A number of robberies have occurred recently in various villages.

I pointed out that, though chief himself resided in neutral zone, the greater part of tribe lived in our zone, and would probably consider themselves covered by protection offered to their chief. He must also take into consideration proximity of district to Afghanistan. As the vice-consul had acted entirelyjon his own initiative it could not be difficult for the Russian Government to instruct him to withdraw letter. His Excellency replied by assuring me that the Russian Government had not the slightest wish to mix themselves up in the affairs of the tribe in question. Difficulty was that in Oriental countries like Persia a consul’s disavowal by his Government always led to his losing prestige.

In a further despatch, copy of which I also enclose herewith, Major Sykes transmits a copy, in translation, of a letter written by Yusuf to the Russian general officer commanding on the morning of the bombardment. I feel it my duty to add that my Russian colleague, to whom Major Sykes’s telegraphic account of the suspicious circumstances attending Yusuf’s escape from Meshed was communicated by my predecessor, entirely refuses to credit the accuracy of the report. M. Poklewsky considers it to be an unfortunate relic of the old spirit of mutual suspicion and animosity that animated the secret agents of the British and Russian legations and consulates in the days prior to the understanding between the two Governments.

The man Nawab (Enclosure 2) was naturally afraid to come to the consulate, and consequently I arranged for his evidence to be taken by the attache, and promised that his name would not appear. In my despatch under reference I stated that the agents provocateurs left Meshed half an hour after the bombardment, whereas the actual hour was 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. This information in the first place reached me through a third person, whence this inaccuracy of detail. It would take about three .hours to reach Kala Imamia, and the waggoner reached Yeirani about 5 a.m., as stated by the dash than of Yeirani (Enclosure 3).' 2.

NAWAB, a sowar of the amniah, # stated that on the night of the bombardment he and two other ammah sowars, named Ali and Abid, were guarding the roof of the ^ house of their officer in the street near the New (Russian) frate. He and his companions, at about four and a-half or five hours after sunset, saw four Russian Cossacks followed by a waggon driven by four horses in which twelve or fifteen men (Persians) were sitting, two of whom were talking in Persian. The waggon passed out through the New Gate. Ten minutes afterwards he and his companions saw four Russian Cossacks on foot, followed by fifteen men (Persians), and this batch also passed out of the New Gate.

ABUL KASIM, dashtban of Veirani, stated that after the bombardment, which he heard clearly, he collected all the flocks and villagers and shut the village gate and kept watch on the roof. About an hour before dawn a man whom he did not know came to the village. He was riding on a waggon-horse. This he was sure of, as he saw the collar and also that there was no saddle. The man asked for the sons of Haji Suliman, and said that he wanted three or four horses for Yusuf and Mohammed, who were at Kala Imamia. The men he enquired for were absent, and on being told this he asked for some bread. He was given six loaves, and then left. Evidence taken before me on April 25, 1912 : P. M. Sykes, Major.

I HAY E the honour to forward the translation of a letter written by Yusuf to General Redko. on the morning of the bombardment. Its chief value, perhaps, consists m the fact that it corroborates statements made by me m previous despatches. 2. I have heard from a reliable source that on the night of the bombardment the general stated that the “ victory ” was not of so much importance in itself as the fact that, by arranging to end operations at night he was able to send away his agents out of Meshed_ without the possibility of my being- aware that he was doing so. He added that British policy had bested Russia in the matter of the return of the ex-Shah and that the bombardment was the Russian reply. It is interesting to note how fully these statements corroborate what I at first suspected and then was able to procure evidence about. It also^ shows, yet once again, that the whole bombardment was deliberately plotted, and it is to be hoped that the authors of this crime will not escape retribution. 3.

I BEG to state that, as 1 have served the Eussian Government for twentv-two years, I was against the British and Afghan Governments and most of the Persians. 1 was thus P u t to losses, and did service in Bokhara and Khiva for the Russian Government. On my return to Meshed from St. Petersburgh, I, from fear of the constitutional Government and police, took sanctuary in the shrine for one year and eleven days. I was besieged there, and on this occasion no help was given to me by the Russian consulate-general. At last 1 came to the Russian consulate-general, where facilities were afforded me for corresponding with the Tashkend authorities, and in order to arrange about other affairs. By the orders of the Russian consul-g-eneral I made the public, who were against the Russians, to be their friends, and so arranged it that the people, m the presence of GO,000 men in the Masjid-i-Gauhar-Shad and in the New Court, used to shout “ Long live the Emperor of Russia and the Russian officers ! ” In spite of all this service, Abdul Hamid, the chief interpreter of the Russian consulate-general, who was a dishonest official of the Russian Government turned against me and disappointed the public. This compelled me to leave the Russian consulate, and 1 took sanctuary in the shrine. As 1 promised to all the priests and notables of Khorasan to be true to them, I informed them that the Russian consulate-general was very unkind to them, and I was compelled to take steps for their and my own protection. I gathered a good number of men to support my cause. I informed the Governor of fashkend of all that was happening. I had every hope in the Russian consul-general and yourself to provide me with funds and some service. Abdul Hamid, instead of kindness, telephoned me that gallows were up to hang all the priests and myself. This message made me disappointed for the friendship of the Russian Government. I was compelled to think what to do for myself. We were all knowing that the Russian Government would help us. But we see that you have brought up guns against us, and the present members of the nazmiah (police).' 2. We should be permitted to restore order in the town and outside the town, and would arrange so that neither Persian nor foreign subjects should suffer in any way. I will submit my report to you about the arrangements I intend to make, and will act under your orders. In this manner peace will be restored, and I will do service to the Russian Government as desired by their officers. YUSUF MAHAJIR.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 301 of the 2nd ultimo, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed containing his observations on the proposed curtailment of the area of the sanctuary attached to the sacred shrine at Meshed. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Major Sijkes to Sir W. Townley. (No. 24. Secret.) ^ r ’ WTrrT:r „ Meshed, May 4, 1912. Willi reference to the proposed curtailment of the area of the sanctuary, I have the honour to offer the following observations :— 2. Before the bombardment the area termed bast or sanctuary included, as was natural, the entire pile of sacred buildings ; but in addition the chief bazaars were also inside the bast, and the non-Moslem had to stop at a point where a chain showed the limits beyond which he could not pass. Inside this extensive area the chief of police possessed no jurisdiction, and the mutawalibashi or custodian of the shrine held sway through darbans or door-keepers, of whom there are perhaps one thousand, all paid by the shrine. Most of these men have some other means of livelihood, and go on duty every third or fourth day. J _3. The arrangement, as may be imagined, made for serious abuses apart from the inevitable corruption so dear to Persian hearts. Criminals, for instance, were safe from the chief of police inside the bast area, and usually obtained security by taking refuge at one of the numerous madressa, where they solicited the patronage of the students, generally by means of the “ silver key.” The sanctuary area, moreover, formed a centre for agitators of every class, who, in complete security and comfort, were able to hatch plots against the peace of the city. Finally, the hindrance to trade was considerable, as a European had to arrange to meet merchants elsewhere than at their offices. 4. After the bombardment the Russians continued to enter the sacred buildings on I horseback, but gradually it struck them that some arrangement must be come to. On j the 15th April I received a telegram from the legation to the effect that my colleague had received the strongest orders from lehran and also from St. Petersburgh that the bast should be restored to its previous limits. Two days later I visited the karomzar, who stated that in his opinion it would be better if the bazaars could be kept open. I informed him of the orders received by my colleague, and suggested that this reform might well be made by the Persians themselves, after the Russians had restored the original limits. This suggestion the karguzar approved of. However, I have heard that he has since come to the conclusion that it would make him unpopular to propose to limit the bast area, and that he is now reporting to Tehran in this sense. 5. lo resume, it seems desirable once again to point out that my colleague obeys no orders, whether categorical or otherwise, even when strengthened by instructions from St. Petersburgh. This fact, which of course makes my position one of extreme difficulty and indeed places me in an unfair position, was once again proved by a notice issued in Russian and Persian on the 19th April to the effect that the sacred buildings were not to be entered. This implied that the rest of the sanctuary area was free, and free it is to-day. On the 3rd May 1 received yet another telegram from the legation to the effect that categorical orders and so forth had been given to Prince Dabija and [2506 r—9]again I am reporting that no change has been made m the regulations in spite of remonstrances by the karguzar. I have assumed m the above remarks that the Russian Government is acting in good faith, although the fact that my Russian colleague still holds his post would seem to make this point dubious. 6 A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India. * R M.

Towriley to Sir Edward Grey'. — tfl&amp;ceived May 29.) Tehran, May 11, 1912. WITH reference to Sir G. Barclay’s despatch No. 69 of the 9th April, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copies of two despatches from His Majesty’s consul- general at Meshed reporting respectively the Mutawalibashi’s account of the bombardment of the shrine and the relations of the agitator Yusuf with the Russian authorities after the bombardment. Major Sykes has also furnished me with the accompanying photographs illustrating the shrine and mosque of Gauhar Shad.* Copy of a note drawn up by the surgeon attached to His Majesty’s consulate- general giving a summary of the wounded in hospital is also enclosed. The precise nationality of the wounded does not appear clear from this. In a separate despatch, copy of which I also transmit, Major Sykes has forwarded to me a list of claims by British subjects for property looted by Russian soldiers on the 30th March. THE Mutawalibashi of the shrine sent a message to the effect that he wished to give me an account of his experiences, and subsequently paid me a long visit. Hi-s name is Murtaza Kuli Khan, Tabatabai, and he was a deputy in the last Parliament. He has only been at Meshed for a few months, and has been totally unable to cope with the situation, but his mentality is distinctly above the average. 2. He stated that the day before the bombardment my colleague called on him, and, while urging him in general terms, declared that in no case would the shrine be attacked, but that the agitators would be blockaded. Prince Dabija volunteered a similar statement to me some days previously with much emphasis. 3. On the day of the bombardment the Mutawalibashi received a letter from General^ Redko to the effect that the shrine would be bombarded in an hour’s time unless I usuf and the other agitators quitted it. He was telephoning this message to A usuf and had sent the original to Aga Mirza Ibrahim, when he was informed that two Russian officers wished to see him. They stated that he must go to the general, and, without allowing him to order a horse, took him off on foot. When he passed the British consulate the bombardment started. He was taken out of the Ark Gate, and when opposite the Russian Bank garden was told to run as the guns were about to fire. He ran until exhausted, when he fell down. Finally he reached the Pain Khiaban Gate, about 4 miles from his house, and found the general in the second side street, on the south side of the khiaban, or avenue. 4. He was spoken to roughly and abused for not turning out the agitators. General Redko, among other things, stated that he would level the shrine to the ground. He was then ordered to proceed up the Pain Khiaban to the shrine, and to warn Yusuf that unless he surrendered the shrine would be assaulted. The Mutawalibashi replied that to go up the avenue swept with shot was almost certain death, but he was told that if he refused he would be dealt with by martial law. The Russian military attache, Lieutenant-Colonel Scourratt, took him into the avenue, where there were two field-guns and several Maxims. These were fired, and he was then sent off. After he had gone two or three hundred yards the guns and Maxims again fired, and he was in a hail of bullets. 5. Upon reaching the bast he was seized by Mohamed’s men, who alone had fired any shots. They took him to Yusuf, who was in the “ new court,” but Yusuf, beyond I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. (No. 17. Secret.) Sir, Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Sykes to Sir W. Townley.

He pretended to he fortified in this resolution by a message that the Persian gunners had bombarded the Russian consulate- general and killed my colleague. As a matter of fact I saw them cowering under a wall close to this consulate-general during the entire bombardment. 6. The Mutawalibashi then proceeded to the mosque of Gauhar Shad, where he saw Naib Ali Akbar Hassani and the Talib-ul-Hak. He had hardly seen them when Russian soldiers opened fire from the roof of the mosque. He accordingly went inside the haram, which consists of the tomb chamber and three galleries. There he found a large panic-stricken crowd of unarmed men and women. A few Persian soldiers with their arms left the haram on hearing that Mohamed had captured two Russian guns. . The firing was incessant, and the Mutawalibashi sat m a corner of the tomb chamber with bullets coming in from two sides. He states that there was Maxim fire from the Dar-ul-Siada and from the Dar-ul-Tohid. There were some casualties. 7. It was dark but for a few candles in the tomb chamber, and perhaps two hours after nightfall the shooting ceased, and the Russian soldiers entered the tomb chamber and signed to everyone to go out. On the way they were struck with butts of rifles. Reaching the “ old court ” they were placed under guard. Colonel Scourratt appeared on the scene in a semi-drunken condition, in which connection the general had given wine to all the officers to celebrate the “ victory.” The Mutawalibashi said to him that he was suffering this indignity owing to him. M. Scourratt said that he would arrange his release, and placed him apart from the prisoners. When he went off the guard took him back to the crowd, and this operation was repeated ten times. 8. He was finally taken to the general, who ordered him to accompany his adjutant and show him every corner of the shrine. He consequently spent the night in this manner. Every door was broken in, and students and others arrested, but no armed men. On the following afternoon he was released, having been kept without food or rest throughout the period of twenty-six hours. 9. On the 1st April he accompanied my Russian colleague and myself to the shrine, and upon his return to the Russian consulate a document, which has subsequently been used to justify my Russian colleague, was drawn up by Mirza Abdul Hamid on behalf of Prince Dabija. Its contents have been published. The Mutawalibashi at first refused to take the responsibility, but reflecting that it was most important to regain possession of the shrine, he did not seal but signed the precious document with half his usual signature, this being a usual method of protest in Persia, where a seal is alone fully valid. 10. I asked my visitor what he believed the relations of Yusuf and my Russian colleague to be. He replied that Yusuf had told him when he saw him before the bombardment that the Russians were working to bring back the ex-Shah. He said that he had no other information, except that messages were daily overheard on the telephone, which proved that Yusuf was in close correspondence with my colleague. 11. In conclusion, Sir, I would venture to point out that this evidence corroborates the accuracy of the information already given by me, in which connection I am informed by the Mutawalibashi that he has sent the fullest possible report to the Regent, which is due to reach Tehran on the 17th April. I also feel that, if asked, the legation might state that the Mutawalibashi behaved very well under most trying circumstances. I have, &amp;c. P. M.

Sir, Meshed, April 13, 1912. IN continuation of former despatches, in which I have shown clearly that lusui was the agent provocateur of the Russian authorities, and was in close correspondence with them until the bombardment, I now beg to give the evidence that I havecollec ted on the subject of the relations of this individual with the Russians since the bombardment. 2 I have heard from numerous sources that the city walls, which are in a good state of preservation, with seven gates, and perhaps twenty places whei - e a man can .Vscramble over them, were surrounded by a cordon of troops; there was also a bright moon. Consequently it is obvious that, as there are no houses or gardens touching 01 even close to the walls, it was almost out of the question for any armed agitators to escape without Russian assistance. Furthermore, no prisoners were taken from the shrine until three or four days after the bombardment. 3. Half an hour alter the bombardment three witnesses saw from the roof of a ouse close to the New Gate, firstly a waggon containing some men, whom they believed to be agitators, and, secondly, a batch of men on foot. Both bodies were surrounded by Russian soldiers, dhe witnesses did not recognise Yusuf or any of the agitators. Ihe two parties passed out of the New Gate, which follows a deserted loute to the lesidence of the Russian Bank, crossing the main roads outside the gate. 4. Two days later one of my gardeners was returning from Jaghark when he met a^ friend who told him that Yusuf and his party had passed through Veirani, a village situated, between Meshed and Shandiz, perhaps 12 miles from Meshed. One of our employes owns land at this village, and so he was sent to make enquiries, and a second man was sent independently to enquire as far as Shandiz. 5. The results of this enquiry are that Yusuf reached Xala Imamia, near Veirani on tne night of the bombardment in a waggon. The villagers, seeing a party of armed men, refused to open their gate, but gave them some bread. The driver of the waggon then rode on one of his horses to Veirani, where the Muin-ut-Tujjar also owns land, and he returned with two horses and two mules. Yusuf sent in a letter to my Kussian colleague, and a second one to the Muin-ut-Tujjar by the wao-o-oner and then, with Mohamed, rode to Shandiz, which he reached in the morning. h. Since then Yusuf has written me two or three petitions from Shandiz and arrud m the hills, asking my help, and declaring that he was deceived by the- Kussians. lo these I have given no reply. He has also written to my colleague and to General Redko. dhe latter, who had given him instructions to go to Kaakha—this being an unfrequented route until the summer—was at first very angrv to hear that he had gone oft with Mohamed. He subsequently, however, sent him' a' verbal message to tne eifect that Ins property would be restored and further if he left Mohamed and proceeded to Askabad via Kaakha. that a letter or letters had been received from Tashkend in (vide my despatch No. 10). ihis information is most reliable, and corroborates the accuracy of the statement m my previous despatch. 7. I would at this point make a few remarks about Mohamed. This brigand is believed to have had relations with my colleague. In support of this charge I was in oimet y t le smaihs of Dizbad that this w r as the case (vide summary to Meshed inary i\o. i of 1012). 1 also heard from a most reliable source that Mohamed captured the Agazada on his way to Tehran, and made him seal a koran in favour of the- ex-biiah, and that this .koran was sent to my colleague. Finally, the sowars, who were wounded and released by Mohamed after his affray at Zakkaria (vide entry of the 20th re binary) stated that his followers had told them that they had been sent for by my colleague. All this evidence is strongly corroborative, coming as it does from^ such very different sources. 8. lo conclude, we have to add to the above evidence the fact that the bombard ment was not started until 4M5 p.m., whereas elementary military prudence would PvI e J- 1 1 ! ear ;T m u the moram S’ and the fact that &gt; although the position was of xceptional strength, there was not a single casualty in the attacking force. Jrlv f. n thls . accumulated evidence, it is hard to doubt that the Russian authorities eftbct tS?Lfarious^nds 1U C ° llusion i with Yusuf and other acjents provocateurs to I have reflected a good deal as to what was the object of the bombardment, and have also ascertained the opinion of various Persians. The universal feeling is that the Russians wished to strike a blow which would echo like a thunder-clap' all over ersia, and strike fear into all hearts. This view I am inclined to accept, and believe- that action mis taken on the same lines as by Skobeleff, who massacred men and women with this avowed purpose m view at Geoktepe. I also believe that possibly by false reports the necessary instructions were obtained from St. Petersburgh. Thus we instructions given him He ■was also informed answer to his petition4 have two high Russian officials acting in collusion with agents P™ocateur s to create serious disturbances in a friendly State, and then utihsmg these disturbances to further their own wicked purposes. The fact that 1 fl 00 P ea ° 0 ^ riental ® have been shot down, that serious damage has been mAicted, and t . gs of armed ruffians have been let loose to rob is nothing to men of this stamp. Indeed, the onlyC?) satisfactory item in this criminal outrage by a strong European lower on a decadent Oriental State, an outrage, moreover, whose effects will be felt m India is that proofs have been secured which are constantly being strengthened I&gt;y fres evi nee. 9 A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India.

There is no doubt whatever that the Russian officers and men looted shops and houses extensively Every Persian was made a prisoner, and only Rassian soldiers and subjects were allowed in the sacred zone for several days,_ and needless to say the Persians were too much frightened to have looted duimg the bombaidmen.

J ® ir ’ 1 HAVE the honour to submit the following report on considered to be the second phase of the agitation in favour of the ex-Shah at Meshed. 2. Ihese fresh disturbances commenced on the 14th February by an attack on nown constitutionalists, who were_ beaten, and by much pulpit abuse directed against is consulate-general. J he constitutionalists wished to retaliate more persico and collected 900 tomans (1801) to be given to a gang of Caucasians (Russian subjects), who RhLTJTh M | mUr | de b Y Qu U i f f Iera l 1 an , d . °* her Baders. Fortunately the attache, jan Sahib JIubaiek Ah Shah, heard of this intended action, and was able to prevent i b &gt; r P oint . in &amp; 0U J the support of this consulate-general would be withdrawn and Prince Dabija^ 011 ^ a ^ out a state affairs that would justify intervention by U* Aw A e 14t J] February I received a circular telegram from the legation to the effect that the ex-Shah had agreed to abandon his efforts, and would leave Persia in consideration of his adherents being pardoned and of a pension. On the 15th February tinn C ° t0 J -° m “f in a j° int letter t0 the Kargazar giving this informa- • i ’ 1I11( f e Eahija, m reply, stated that he had received no information and no instructions I consequently reported the matter to the legation, and urged that joint action should be enjoined on both consulates-general. ' 4, On the 18th February I received a telegram from the legation to the effect that y co eague had been instructed to change his attitude towards the ex-Shah and to make it widely known. I at once addressed him, but yet again was assured in writing no instructions had been received. The situation was somewhat critical, as the mob was enormous owing to it being a holiday, and so I again telegraphed the situation to Tehran. On the same day I received a reply from the legation, and again a further egram on the morning of the 20th February. On the afternoon of the 20th February the Russian consulate acknowledged the receipt of instructions. ^ n 5 ’ ^ r u]( ? Venbure to P°^ nt ou t that the above evidence proves that either mv colleague has shown utter disregard for truth or that the fact of the arranged departure of the ex-Shah was not telegraphed to him between the t4th and 20th February and fhfvmXA trances to the British Legation, he received no instructions until notice* 1 FebrUary ’ VVllch act ' m vlew of ' extreme urgency of the case, calls for 6. In paragraph 4 I stated that my Russian colleague acknowledged that he had received instructions, but he declined to join me in any action as he had received no o ders to do so. Consequently there was no means of effectually checking his intrigues and the matter had to be once again referred to the legation. ° ’ 7. Meanwhile, Mohammad Nishapnri, who headed a large gang, and whose robberies have been referred to m the diary, rode across the mountains to a hamlet a few miLs [2473/-12] Bdistant from Meshed with some twenty followers. The Governor-General, with his usual fatuity, dispatched a handful of sowars to seize him, but he shot four of them with a loss of two men on his own side, and at night joined Yusuf in the shrine. 8. On the ‘21st February my colleague, wTo had written a letter to the Talib-ul-Hak (see “A”), which speaks for itself, showed his true colours by delivering two telegrams ^ to the agitators. The first and most important (see “ B ”) was from the Shoa-es- Sultaneh to ^fusuf Herati. It was naturally posted up in triumph in the shrine. But of equal importance is the fact that it proves that my colleague was determined to continue his original policy. 9. On the 22nd February I again reported the situation to the legation and followed this up by proposing to write an independent letter to the Kargazar. This the legation approved of, and I enclose a copy of it marked “ C.” This, together with my colleague’s letter to the Talib-ul-Hak, was printed and posted up by the Persian authorities, but did little good, as was only to be expected, as neither letter was signed by the two consuls-general. 10. Meanwhile, the legation had been procuring stronger orders for Prince Dabija from St. Petersburgh, and I was again instructed to attempt to induce him to co-operate but in vain, as my colleague was determined to plough a lonely and crooked furrow. 11. On the 28th February Prince Dabija wrote an ultimatum to the Persian authorities (see “D ”) to the effect that they must either disperse the mob at once or confess their inability to do so. In despair the Kargazar came to me, and I advised him to reply that, as everything was done at Tehran by the two legations, it was hoped that my colleague would consult me and then address the Governor-General in a joint letter. Prince Dabija was informed of the action of the Kargazar, and it apparently dawned on him that he had gone too far, for the time being, so he hastily sent his dme damnee, Mirza Abdul Hamid, to say that the letter was not seriously intended. 12. On the 2nd March my Russian colleague finally agreed, with some ill-temper, to sign a collective letter to the Persian authorities. On the following day a rumour of the ex-Shah’s departure reached me, but I could not inform the local authorities of the fact until I heard it officially from the legation some days later. It seemed hopeless to ask my colleague to join me in a collective letter, and the news was by this time well known, and generally believed. 13. My colleague, through his “agents provocateurs,” announced that the ex-Shah would return in forty days, and as the body of men in the shrine was still secretly supported by him, it continued to increase in numbers and in activity. 14. To conclude, in a former despatch (No. 8 of the 14th February) I have proved that there is no doubt whatever that this deplorable agitation was started entirely by Prince Dabija, and this letter equally proves that my Russian colleague, in spite of all the efforts of the British representatives at Tehran and St. Petersburgh, has been allowed to continue his sinister activity almost unchecked. 15.

On the 6th March I received a telegram from the legation to the effect that my colleague recommended the proclamation of martial law on the ground that a Russian officer had been shot at and that Russian lives and property were in danger. On the following day I replied that, according to Prince Dabija’s letter to the Governor- General, an officer was returning from the bank house, situated a mile or more outsideO Meshed, about 2 a.m., when he was shot at. He and his Cossacks returned the fire, and no one was hurt. I stated that neither I nor the Persian authorities could obtain any information corroborating this story, but that, even if true, it was of slight importance considering all the circumstances. I added that, as the Russians were aiding the agitation, they incurred no danger. I concluded by reiterating my belief that the Russian consul-general had himself organised the disturbances with a view to taking over the administration of the city. 3. Meanwhile, Prince Dabija had sent three bodies of troops to different quarters of the town, partly to support the police and partly to protect Russian subjects. He, however, apparently came to the conclusion that their presence might lead to the shrine being attacked, and consequently he withdrew them temporarily until the situation developed still further. 4. I took this opportunity of trying to effect a reconciliation between the various parties, and finally induced my colleague, who had altered his attitude for the time being, to join in them. Khan Sahib Mubarak Ali Shah, who conducted the negotiations on my behalf, induced the leaders to accept certain terms, and on the 20th March they had agreed to seal them, when my colleague withdrew his representative, alleging that the Persians did not mean to make terms. I was subsequently informed from more than one independent source that my colleague secretly informed the leaders that the ex-Shah had already landed at Bandar Gaz, and was on his way to Meshed ! 5. As might be imagined, the failure of these negotiations reacted unfavourably on the general situation, and on the 24th March there was an attack on the Shir-i-Shur police station, close to the consulate quarter, and bullets fell everywhere, including the consulate garden, causing some narrow escapes. The Yezdi merchants of Meshed approached my colleague and asked him to restore order, and at last he felt himself in a position to carry out his scheme. He sent for the Governor-General and Kargazar, and, with needless rudeness, said that they must either immediately restore order or confess their inability to do so. As both officials knew that the cause of the disorder was the Russian consul-general himself, they discreetly replied that they had not sufficient force at their disposal. My colleague, who had not asked me to this meeting, thereupon instructed General Redko to take charge of the city and proclaimed martial law. 6. Before this had occurred a telephone message was tapped in my office. It was a conversation between Yusuf and the Russian consulate-general. Yusuf reported that he had captured the Shir-i-Shur police station, and was now ready to seize the telegraph office when instructed to do so. The reply from the Russian consulate-general was to wait a little. 7. In the evening the police were assembled and placed under a Russian officer, Captain Kharanof, who is a Sunni Mahommedan from the Caucasus, and I was informed by my colleague of the action taken by him. That night mixed guards of police and soldiers were posted in three quarters of the city. 8. On the following day several interesting messages were tapped. One of them, from Yusuf, was to the effect that Prince Dabija was acting contrary to his promises; that he had done everything according to Russian instructions, and was being badly treated by having Russian troops sent to surround the shrine, as people were now turning on him for having betrayed them. He begged that in any case the Persian police might be withdrawn and Persian soldiers substituted. In a subsequent reply Yusuf was informed that Prince- Dabija wished him to be at ease, as he would take away the police, and the Russian soldiers had nothing to do with the agitators. The Russians simply intended to carry out their own policy. The Talib-ul-Hak, the religious agitator, had a conversation with Mirza Abdul Hamid, of the Russian consulate-general, and was similarly reassured. 9. On the evening of the 26th March the police were marched into the lines of the Russian soldiers, where they were surrounded and disarmed. They were then interned, and on the following day were paid off and dismissed. The chief of police and six other officers are being used to give local information to Captain Kharanof, and Persian soldiers have now been posted with the Russian troops. 10. On the 26th March a body of 150 men declared a “jahad,” or holy war, and donned shrouds. They were joined by 2,000 or 3,000 villagers, and a strong fanaticaloutburst appeared probable, as they charged out on some Russian soldiers who were posting notices, and the latter ran away. However, the efforts of the attache to induce the leaders to withdraw have been successful to some extent, and yesterday, owinxr to ( ™ence, a “ fatwa, or religious decree, was issued to the effect that to carry Sms m the shrine was disrespectful to it, and inadvisable, and that shops should be reopened At the time of writing a few shops are opened, the crowds in the shrine appear to be dispersing, and only Yusuf, Mohamed, the Talib-ul-Hak, and their followers remain 11 io summarise, I have proved, and, indeed, the fact is notorious, that the representative of a friendly Power has taken advantage of the weakness of Persia to start an agitation in favour of the ex-Shah, using as his chief “agent provocateur” Yusuf who was at the time living under his protection at the Russian consulate- genera. Secondly, after the British Legation had been assured that orders to change his policy had been dispatched to Prince Dabija, he undoubtedly transmitted telegrams to the agitators, one being from the Shoa-es-Sultaneh to Yusuf. Thirdly I have driven evidence which tends to prove that my colleague has never changed his policy in spite of any instructions he has received In short, it is clear that he has either disobeyed his mstinotions oi has not receryed them. My position has been extremely difficult as : my coileague, in spite of the efforts of the legation, has practically declined throughout to co-operate, and I have been unable to prevent the success of his plan which has incidentally caused loss of life, much suffering, and an utter dislocation of business.

Sir, India O ffice, May 30, 1912 IN forwarding tlie enclosed copy of a telegram, dated the 26th May, from the Government of India regarding the alleged encroachment by Afghan troops on Persian territory in the neighbourhood of Gazik, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to ask if the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is now in a position to give him any information as to the probability of an early withdrawal of the Russian forces from Meshed . It was pointed out in Sir R. Ritchie’s letter of the 9th April that the Russian occupation of Meshed would probably have on the Ameer of Afghanistan the same effect as their occupation of Tabreez had had on the Porte, and it is significant that it has been almost immediately followed by an advance of, or rumoured intention to advance, the Afghan frontier. But it will obviously be very difficult to remonstrate with the Ameer upon an attempt to improve an undemarcated line in self defence, when Russian troops are occupying and administering the capital of Khorasan with the acquiescence, and even apparently the good-will, of His Majesty’s Government. Apart from this difficulty—which, though it is of a local nature, may grow to considerable magnitude—the policy of the agreement with Russia will, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion, be frustrated if, under cover of it, the Russian Government are to be permitted peacefully to possess themselves of one of the main strategical points from which it has been the object of British policy for half a century to exclude them.

M. Sazonof stated that he was most anxious to work in close co-operation with : His Majesty’s Government, and to give the most careful consideration to the interests of Great Britain, and also to meet, as far as he possibly could, the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. He thought that of late practical expression had been given to these sentiments, and he especially instanced the ready manner in which Russia had acquiesced in the desire of His Majesty’s Government to remove the ex-Shah from Persia. M. Sazonof also pointed out that the Russian Government were being continually reproached by an influential section’ of the Russian press for too great leniency in dealing with the situation in Northern Persia, and were being urged to take strong measures. With respect to what occurred at Meshed, M. Sazonof observed that the bastis had been more than once summoned to leave the sanctuary, and that they had replied by opening fire on the Russian troops, thereby forcing the latter to take serious action. He doubted whether what had taken place would create much commotion in Persia; • All kinds of consequences had been prophesied when it had been necessary to: execute • the leading Mujteheds at Tabreez, whereas in fact this measure had caused no stir at all, and the local population had been rather pleased than otherwise. M. Sazonof was afraid that until a more normal situation had been established at : Meshed and in Khorassan it would not be possible to withdraw the troops, and Russia must preserve her liberty of action.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith, in translation, the account published by the official telegraph agency of the action recently taken by the Russian troops at Meshed. M. Sazonof, to whom as reported in my telegram No. 127 of yesterday I communi cated the substance of Sir G. Barclay’s telegrams Nos. 223 and 227 of the 31st March and the 2nd April, maintained that it was clear from Prince Dabija’s report that the shrine had not been touched and that it was only in consequence of the provocation given by the fedais that an attack had been made on the bast quarter outside the shrine, where all the bad characters of the town sought refuge. I replied that Major Sykes distinctly stated that the shrine had been bombarded and entered by the Russian troops. I was aware, from what the Persian Minister had told me, that strict orders had been sent to the Russian authorities at Meshed to respect the shrine ; but it did not necessarily follow that Prince Dabija had obeyed these orders. He had on more than one occasion in the past acted contrary to his instructions ; and it was impossible to place confidence in a man whose one ambition seemed to be to play the part of an agent provocateur and to create incidents. If Major Sykes’s account of the affair was correct, there would be an outburst of indigna tion throughout the Mahommedan world which might seriously affect our interests both in India and in South Persia. M. Sazonof however contended that Prince Dabija’s telegram was so explicit that he could not place credence in the report telegraphed by Major Sykes. ^ I spoke to M. Sazonof again this afternoon, as instructed by your telegram No. 302 of the 2nd April, and also pointed out that even though Prince Dabija’s statement that the shrine had not been, touched were correct, the bast quarter that had been bombarded by the Russian troops really formed an integral part of the shrine. ^ M. Sazonof would not admit tins, and insisted that a distinction must be drawn between the two, adding that it had been absolutely necessary to clear out the agitators. He told me however that since I spoke to him yesterday he had caused further enquiries to be made by telegraph both at Meshed and at Tehran. The Persian Minister, whom I saw a little later, informed me that he intended asking M. Sazonof to recall Prince Dabija. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. P.S. April 4, 1912.—Since writing the above I have received Sir G. Barclays telegram No. 232 of to-day’s date. I have given the substance in a private letter to M. Sazonof of which I have the honour to enclose a copy. G. W. B. Enclosure 1 in No. 1 . Translation of an Agency telegi'am from Meshed dated March lb (ol), published in the “ Official Messenger,” of March 20 (April 2), 1912. FROM the day the administration of the town passed into the hands of the chief of the Russian military column the peaceful inhabitants, who had joined the adherents of the ex-Shah, commenced to leave the precincts of the bast surrounding the tomb of Imam-Riza, in which they had taken refuge. Latterly, those who remained in bast were almost exclusively combined bands of marauders, who had arrived ostensibly for purposes of worship from Shiraz and throughout Khorassan, and numbering 600-700 well-armed men. The Afghan fugitive, Usuff-Khan, was leader of the united band. Notwithstanding the occupation of the town by oifr troops, and taking advantage of the fact that the latter, avoiding as far as possible entering intjp. thfedocajlVkhrines, carefully [2440 i 11] L ec 4 ; ; I 8 \o refrained from any collision with those sitting in bast the marauders commenced to act with extreme insolence. They commenced to detain in the bast rob, and even subject to torture, all who appeared to Ifeuif-Khan and the other robber khans to merit suspicion, n^t excepting eVen the more respectable persons. The robbers beganjv to act in a provocative manner towards ethe Russian troops passing the bast, gmngV them to understand by signs that they would all be killed. Tsu an even notified certain nersons by telephone, including the nat.ve clerks of the Russian consulate- general that when he and his followers left the hast he would hang and .slaughter all Russians and other Europeans. The situation became impossible^ The inhabitants of Meshed began openly to complain, declaring that the Russians had taken the town into their hands but were not restoring order. and were permitting the robbers to torture and rob innocent people in the very centre of the town and to impede the trade of he whole reoion. The “ mujteheds ” controlling the bast—Mirsa-Ibrahim, Talib-ul-Khakk, Kaimakam-ud-Taumieti, and certain other clergy and estate-owners were evidently playing a double game and secretly supporting those m bast ‘ In view of this the consul-general, Prince Rabija, notified them that lie considered further negotiations with them possible only on the condition that they compelled the robbers to disarm and leave the town. This demand was not only not carried out, but the leaders of the robbers in bast even allowed themselves to present on their side various absurd conditions to the consul. In consequence of this, the consul was compelled to demand categorically that all the robbers should be disarmed and dispersed by three o’clock on the day of the 17th (30th) March and at the same time warned them that upon failure to MSI this demand he would hand over complete authority to the chief of the Russian forces. A t the time named, in view'of the situation being unchanged, the bast was surrounded by Russian troops, and General Keidko personally attempted for the last time to persuade the robbers to lay down their arms voluntarily. In reply to these pacilic proposals the robbers opened hre on the Russian troops Whereupon the artillery commenced operations, and after them the troops. Shortly afterwards the hast was 'taken. The tomb of Imam-Riza, the sole shrine m the bast, w r as untouched. A number of tbe robbers still remained in the tomb and are one bv one surrendering to our troops. , Military operations within the locality surrounding the tomb of the imam nave taken place previously, during the time when Asyf-ud-Dowleh was governor-general of Khor assan. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Sir G. Buchanan to M. Sazonof. My dear M. Sazonof, March 22 (April 4), 1912. I FEAR that the Meshed incident seems likely to have serious consequences. A telegram which I have just received from Barclay says that Vossouk-ed-Dowlen has tendered his resignation on the ground that it is impossible for him to justify a policy of conciliation towards Russia now that his enemies can point to the fact that that policy has failed to save Persia from such an outrage as the desecration of the holy shrine at Meshed. , Vossouk-ed-Dowleh complained bitterly of Prince Dabija, to whose intrigues ne attributes this unfortunate incident, and of the fact that the Cossacks had even brought their horses into the shrine. He also drew Barclay’s attention to the fact that all the prominent agitators had escaped. As I pointed out to you yesterday it is not only the building that contains the tomb that is considered sacred, but also the ground round it which is used as a sanctuary and comprised in what is known in Persia as the shrine. Yours very sincerely, * GEORGE W. BUCHANAN.13 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s consul-genera] at Meshed, reporting on the disturbances which had taken place at that town up to the 14th February in connection with the agitation in favour of the ex-Shah. recently taken place at Meshed. 2. As reported by me, the Russian troops duly reached the capital of Khorasan ! and, thanks to the incessant activity of the karguzar and chief of police, supported by this consulate-general, there was no hostility of any description shown. Even drunken Russian officers and men are treated with the utmost consideration and politeness, the police authorities telephoning for a party of their own countrymen to take them home. Marches through the city, too, which were calculated to excite the popidace, passed off without any incident, and Meshed, after a few days of curiosity, ceased to think about 3. This tranquil state of affairs was apparently most displeasing to nry colleague. Ever since the return of the ex-Shah, he has openly expressed his opinion to me and to everyone else that he would regain the throne. An astrologer foretold that he would be first defeated and then, after reaching Meshed, would march on Tehran, and this prediction Prince Dabija has adopted. In pursuance of these views, he recently gave sanctuary to a noted scoundrel, Yusuf Herati, who had been demonstrating in favour of the ex-Shah for some months from the security of the shrine, but had apparently outstayed his welcome there. The Persian authorities, who were most anxious to get rid of this individual, gave him 100 tomans, and it was apparently arranged that he should leave Meshed. A. However, my colleague decided otherwise, and one morning I heard that this worthy, together with a gholam of the Russian consulate, by name Akbar Buland, or “the tall,” a former servant of the ex-Shah, were demonstrating and creating a disturb ance. The custom on these occasions is to pitch a tent and provide plenty of tea and sugar, which procedure speedily collects a crowd of loafers. In this particular instance Yusuf Herati had a flag with “ Let us pray the Russian consul-general to restore our Shah to us,” and it is unnecessary to enquire who paid for the tea and sugar. Mean while the kaimakam, head of the Rizavi Seyyids and the notorious Muavin-ut-Tujjar, who were working in close touch with my colleague, had started similar demonstrations in every quarter, and needless to say, the whole city was disturbed and shops were shut in some cases. Russian officers were cheered by the mobs, and in one case at any rate replied in Turkish that the ex-Shah ivas considered by the Czar to be his own son. o. Most unfortunately, M. Grigorief, the Russian first secretary, who is a refreshing contrast to his unscrupulous and corrupt chief, was ill, and so I reported the matter to the legation and requested instructions. At that time I had no knowledge as to whether any final decision had been taken about the ex-Shah, and consequently confined myself to begging the leaders to restrain the mob from committing acts of violence which would lead to the Russians taking over the administration of the city. In reply to my telegram instructions came for me to visit my colleague and to urge him to obey his instructions. CONFIDENTIAL. PERSIA. Section 6. I April 1.] [13654] (No. 41.) Sir, Sir G.

Grigorief agreed that I was bound to do so. I next said that it was to my colleague’s interest to withdraw his numerous agents and to calm the mob, as 1 lelt sure that the Russian Government would not approve of his action, which was m defiance of orders which, as M. Grigorief had already acknowledged, had been received on the 4th TT q pV, Tt was finally agreed that my colleague should write to me that _ he withdrew his protection from Yusuf Herati and would calm the mob. I promised in return to telegraph this assurance to Tehran. # 7. ' M. Grigorief wished me to join him in stating that the ex-bhah was himself opening up negotiations with a view to quitting Persia, as he feaied that if the truth were known, the results would be disastrous to Russian prestige. I ivas unable to go as far as this, but agreed to confine myself to stating that the ex-Shah would not return. . . . . , 1 . My Russian colleague, who had probably received instructions, warned his agents to withdraw, and the disturbances, which at one time threatened to justify Russian intervention, gradually ceased. 8. The Governor-General, who is a weak creature, was useless duimg these troubles, hut both the karguzar and chief of police behaved very well indeed. Just after my colleague’s agreement to withdraw his agents provocateurs, the mob demanded the dismissal of the chief of police and the return to a begler beggi and khatkhuda, or elders with long beards. The governor-general acceded to this, and sending for the chief of police, dismissed him. An appeal was made to me, and as the chief of police alone stood between Meshed and anarchy, to be tempered by Russian administration, I took the unusual step of intervening, and sent the attache to the governor-general with instructions to point out that the crisis was over, and that it was unjust and fatuous to dismiss the official mainly thanks to whom the situation had been saved. _ As I threatened to agree with Prince Dabija on the next occasion that he complained of the Rukn-u-Dola’s weakness, the chief of police w r as telephoned for and duly reinstated. 9. The attached telegraphic correspondence shows that my colleague was earnestly supporting the ex-Shah, and stated that 90 per cent, of the inhabitants of Khorasan were in his favour. But as I pointed out, there is no strong feeling m favour of either party, and no other risings were reported froiu other centres, as would surely have been the case had the agitation been a genuine one. Again I hear that on the 16th February, not only did Prince Dabija send telegraphic petitions to the Czar and ex-Shah from the royalists, but he even allowed them to dispatch inflammatory messages to the chief cities of Persia. He is thus again breaking the spirit if not the actual letter of the agreement. 10. In conclusion, Sir, 1 have dwelt at length on these disturbances which, but for British influence, would undoubtedly have culminated in an attack on the con stitutionalists, some of whom were severely beaten as it was. More important than what happened is what did not happen, hut may yet happen, as there is ample proof that my colleague is working hard in favour of the ex-Shah, and it is reasonable to suppose that he hopes thereby to seize the administration of Meshed. Finally his disobedience to the orders of his legation indicate a state of affairs which may prove disastrous to the Russian Entente unless it can be remedied. 11.

I then read to him the salient passages of the letter to me from the India Office of the 9th instant. I said that I should be prepared to point out to the India Office or the Indian Government that the question of Tabreez was in a different category, because the forward Turkish movement had really at one time threatened Russian strategic interests, and we coidd not object to those interests being protected. But this did not weaken the force of the apprehension of the India Office as to what had happened at Meshed, and there were no possible strategic interests of Russia endangered there. You had already spoken strongly in St. Petersburgh, and I did not intend to make any official representation founded on the communication from the India Office before I went away for a holiday. I hoped that M. Sazonof would be able to do something which would have a calming influence, and if he could do so, I did not wish to make things more difficult for him by official pressure. I went on to say that the Russian consul-general in Meshed apparently intimated that any unfavourable reports received from us were due to the anti-Russian sentiments of Major Sykes. As a matter of fact, Major Sykes had been very quiet, and had reported nothing but facts which, I understood, were supported by photographs of the damage done to the shrine. The Mutivali, who had signed the letter commending the Russian action, had made it known that he had been obliged to do this under pressure in the Russian consulate, and it seemed clear to me that the Russian consul-general had foiced him to do this in order that the consul-general might exculpate himself. Count Benckendorff and I had discussed things confidentially for so many years that I thought the best course I could take was to tell him frankly, though privately, the difficult position in which we were placed, and meanwhile I would defer the question of any official representation in St. Petersburgh in the hope that M. Sazonol might be able to do something which would calm the feeling which had been aroused. Count Benckendorff did not conceal from me that he had been very apprehensive when he first heard the news of what had happened in Meshed. He had, however, felt reassured after reading the tranquillising statement of the Mutivali. lie did not deprecate anything which I had urged, and seemed to understand the difficulty in which we were placed. He said that he would take some means of making known in St. Petersburgh what I had said to him. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. [ 2440 m— 4] COPY TO INDIA ■ :CR£TARY’S NT.. 1 ').

I TOLD Count Benckendorff to-day that we had had information that the shrine at Meshed had been bombarded, and that there were fifty casualties amongst unarmed pilgrims. I was very much disturbed by this news; it might have a very unfavourable effect on Mahommedan feeling in India. There might even have been Indian pilgrims at the shrine. The Mahommedans in India were already disappointed that, with our strong fleet, we had not prevented Italy from seizing Tripoli. This was unreasonable on their part; but it would not be unreasonable for them to expect that, when there was a good understanding between liussia and England, there should not be Russian outrages to Mahommedan feeling. [ said that I had this morning heard that M. Sazonof’s information was that there had been no attack on the shrine itself, but only on places near it. Till the full facts were known I could say no more, except that 1 was very much disturbed by the news, but, as I was going away for a few days at Easter, I wished to say this before I went. Count Benckendorff had no information, and said that he would send to his Government a short telegram of what I had said. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. [2440 c—3] 19 APR 1912 YTA~Y ! N~ I 6CONFIDENTIAL.

I am to say that, to the best of the Larquess of Crewe’s knowladre and belief, no such interview ever took place, and that the statements attributed to the official, if made, are unauthorised, exarrerated, and misleading. It is not to be denied that Indian I oslems have been watching with deep and natural anxiety the course of events in the theatre of war, and that reso lutions condemning the action of the Italian Govern ment and invitinr the intervention of his '‘.ajesty’s Government have been Made from time to time received and transmitted to your Department. But his ajesty's Government have consistently disclaimed any intention to intervene or even to attempt to influence the Italian Government with rerard to the sphere of operations, and in Lord Crewe’s opinion it would rive a most dangerous encouragement to the Fan-Islamic propaganda if it should comecome to be seriously believed that he European policy of this country is susceptible of beinp* moved or embarrassed by the feelings of Indian ’ oslems - to whatever extent it may in fact be necessary for His L'aie|ty’ s Govemnent to take account of them. I am to sup-rest that, if Sir E. Grey arrees, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome mirht be instructed to endeavour to ascertain privately and with as little delay as possible the origin of the report in 'II Secolo', and that an opportunity mirht be taken - per haps in answering a question in Parliament - to put the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in its proper light. I am to add that, in Lord Crewe’s opinion, the feelings of Indian oslems may very properly be admitted to influence the Asiatic policy of His Hajesty’s ' ovemment, at all events so far as the countries border ing upon India are concerned, find he has himself suggested that it may become almost necessary publicly to dissociate ourselves from such action as that recent ly taken by the Russian authorities at eshed. 1 have etc., (sd) R.Ritchie.CONFIDENTIAL. p i, i 'i r Sir G.

His Excellency spoke somewhat despondently of the situation, remarking that although we had got rid of the ex-Shah matters had not improved, and that, more especially at Kermanshah, state of affairs was serious. Turkish Ambassador had told him that in consequence of an attack on Turkish consulate his Government would have to send troops to Sehn; and he had warned the Ambassador that such a dispatch of troops into the interior of Persia would be a serious step. His Excellency also told me that a sotnia of Cossacks was being sent from Kazvin to Hamadan in consequence of disturbances indirectly connected with Fr^ed-Dowleh. ■ I gave him the gist of Tehran telegrams No. 235 and No. 242 , pointing out that they gave a very different account of incident from that which his Excellency had received from the Russian consul-general at Meshed.

Russian Minister’s information from Russian consul-general is that cupola and cornices of the shrine have been slightly damaged ; mausoleum of Imam Reza is intact; that thirty-nine bastis were killed, twenty-six wounded, and twenty-four arrested, who will be handed over to local authorities ; and that ring leaders of the agitation escaped by secret exits. Consul-general says that he warned ring leaders on 30th March that if by 3 o clock on that day they had not laid down arms he would give full powers to general to act, and be informed general accordingly, telling him that in case of resistance basti must be cleared by force of arms. At 3 o’clock basti was surrounded by Russian troops, and general tried once more to induce bastis to lay down tien arms to which they responded by firing on troops. Bombardment then began, and towards evening troops occupied basti. Russian Minister has communicated to me signed statement of the mutevalli bashi of the shrine recording handing over to him of the shrine by Russian general on nd April.

Mutevalli expresses gratitude to general an Russian officers, and hope that they will not fail to protect shrine. tatement concludes as follows: “ Good organisation and good behaviour of Russian troops are evident from fact that during three months that they have been here no injustice has been done to anyone, and all the inhabitants are most grateful to them. Last regrettable incident was due to great faults of mischief-makers and robbers, who had no doubt entered town by force and ill-treated all the inhabitants, and there is interruption that principle reason of the bombardment and the damage done was presence of those mischief-makers, who were staying here.” {Repeated to Petersburgh.)CONFIDENTIAL.
