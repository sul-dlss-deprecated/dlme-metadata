My telegram dateti 29th June. Haushabis. Following telegram has been received from Bombay Government :— Although requested by Political Resident at Aden, Governor-General of Yemen has not disclosed name and rank of officer to meet Colonel Jacob. It is important that officers should be of equal rank. Governor-General of Yemen also says that his representative is to investigate matter concerning certain taxes and extraordinary imposts which have been exacted and no further. I lease see Viceroys telegram of 30th June 1913 in accordance with which Turkish representative should have full powers to negotiate or to settle matters, as expressed in Secretary of State’s telegram of 23rd July 1913. It is desirable that there should be no doubt as to status of Turkish iepresentative, and his powers. Accordingly we would suggest representa tions should be made at Constantinople so as to settle these questions in advance.” \Ve entirely agree and would request that Ambassador at Constantinople may be instructed today the matter before the Porte.In any further communication on the subject, please quote and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

C-163, dated the 9th April 1914. The attitude of the Iran towards in the tribes in one Protectorate is a natter of obscurity and conseruently of considerable anxiety to us. Although he is at present fully occupied with settling issues with the Idrisi, so as to leave him little desire to ti'y conclusions with us, yet his name is a levor for Arab intriguers to so?/ the seeds of doubt and dessensions in our Protectorate and for our men to blackmail us for presents of money, arris and ammunition. 2. Last February Ka^ithi Atik of Behan forwarded to me a letter addressed by the Imam to the Ahl &lt;$haniR f near Radman), who are the subjects of tho ilultan of Beda, iniorm- inginforming then that he had appointed Sharif Tahoned Husen as Governor over then and directing then to pay tithes, obey his orders and follow his advice # The Kadthi reported that this Governor, on arrival in the Ahl Ghanin country, bo^an to tyrannise over the people with the result that the people its rebelled against him and secured his removal through the i influence of the Kadthi of Behan. In March a letter was received from Sharif Ahmed Am Mohsin of Bohan (our stipendiary) informing me that the Imam and the Turks contemplated proceeding against Behan and the Hadramaut with a large force and requesting a large supply of arms and ammunition to oppose them. About the same time the Fadthli and Audali Sultans forwarded to me somewhat similar letters from one of the Imam’s generals inferring then of the contemplated advance of the Imam*a troops into their countries and advising them to surrender their allegiance prompty to the commander of these troops. \ 3. There was some doubt about the genuineness of these 1 ; V letters, but the letter purporting to emanate from the Imam bore his seal which in known to uo by the courtesy of the|late Sir Ahmed Fadthl, Sultan of L»hej. Letters were accordingly addressed to tho above mentioned Cniefs telling' them that, i: r' &amp; the letters they had received trere genuine, they were intended to bo feelers put out to ascertain their attitude and intentions towards the Iran, ana counselling them to remain staunch friends of tne -British Ucvernment. 4. I have now received a letter from the fc'-ultan of Beda oondradtoting the report of the appointment by the Imam of Sharif Hahonod Hunon as Governor of the Ahl Chanim. a Turkish Sheikh of Sabah, near Eataba, named Ahmed llus^d Alaw, has cone to Aden with a letter, which he says he receivj from the Imam, declaring the lo^ter^a good will towards the British Government and repudiating any idea 0 / 7/Llo intriguing with the tribes in our /Votectorate. r ^e letter too boars the ImamIa seal though slightly different from the seal mentioned above. m 5. Situated as we are far away from the inam’u head*- quarters and practically ostracised from our own Broteoto- rato by the orders of the Secretary of State for India, it is difficult for us to know what is going on in^the Imam’s sphere. I have no reason to believe that the Imam has at present any leisure to move in or towards our Protectorate. But there is no doubt that nio agents are busy on all sides and it is to counteract their mischievous movements anc to setsot tho minds of our Protootod Chiefs and allies at rest that I rocomrended a oody of extra troops accompanying Lieutonanx-Colonol Jacob to the Raushabi country. I have now received a letter from His Excellency the governor General of Yemen informing no that ho has received orders from tho Porte for sending a delegate to meet Lieutenant- Colonel JckCob. Tno details of tho conference will be arranged shortly after colonel Jacob's return from leave. I would therefore request that orders regarding the troops that should accompany him nay be issued at an early date. I have, etc.. Sc/ J.A.

In the opinion of the Governor in Council it is desirable that Lieutenant Colonel Jacob should be accom panied by a suitable escort when he goes to meet the repre sentative of the Ottoman Government. Some eight years have elasned since our withdrawal from the Aden Hinterland in accordanceaccordance with the orders in the Despatch Uo• 20 -Secret f dated the 4th May 1906, from His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, There is evidence that the Turkish Government have entrusted some store in the administration of the Yemen to the Imam# As already reported in my letter above referred to, damage has been caused to boundary pillars, and it is feared that the Imam may encourage in cursions unless it is made clear that we will not tolerate the boundary of our Protectorate to be disrespected. There are, therefore, grounds for the proposal made by the Political Resident, Aden, and the Governor in Council would recommend that the escort proposed by Sir Jemes Bell, namely the whole of the Aden Troop with two machine guns and 100 men of tho Indian Infantry Regiment, should be ordered to accompany Lieutenant Colonel Jacob and that he should be allowed to use^ his discretion with regard to patrolling the border.

In reply, I an to say that in the absence of any definite information that the situation on the Eauehabi ♦ border has materially altered for the worse * since Lieutenant-Colonel Jacobs* last visit to the locality the Government of India see no necessity for the employ ment of the force proposed which would be clearly opposed to the declared policy of His Majesty*s Government.

Z. Cox. Secretary to the Government of India*India Office, London 4th May 1906. Secret, No. 20. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, Views of His Majesty's Govern- The appointment of a new Eesklent at Aden ment on the main questions arising seems to be a proper occasion for laying be.ore in connection with the tribes of the Your Excellency the views of His Majesty s Govern, Aden Protectorate. ment on the main questions arising in connection with the tribes of the Aden hinterland. The correspondence also addressed to the Government of India by the Governor of Bombay in Council, which, by your instructions, His Excellency bas forwarded to me under date 12th March 1906,^ appears to invite an immediate consideration of the principles that it would now be mcst politic to follow in that region. 2. It appears to be supposed by some that the process of delimitation, satisfactorily carried out in concert with the Turkish Government in the Aden hinterland and establishing a definite frontier between the territories of the Sultan and certain of the tribes, brought with it an extension of the responsibilities and obli gations of Great Britain. Lord Lansdowne, however, who was actively concerned in the transaction, explicitly rejected that construction of what had taken place. In the House of Lords on 80th March 1903, replying to a question whether the demarcation arranged with Turkey had enlarged the British sphere of influence, he said: “With regard to the responsibility for these “ territories, I do not see why what has taken place “ should make any difference in these responsi- “ bilities. We have never desired to interfere “ with the internal and domestic affairs of the “ tribes. On the other hand, we have throughout “ made it perfectly plain that we should not “ tolerate the interference of any other Bower with “ them.” In this interpretation His Majesty’s present advisers in the fullest sense concur. The security and strength of Aden as one of the main posts and fortresses that guard the line between England and India, must always be a standing object in national policy. That strength will obviously be impaired and not augmented by quarrels with the tribes, by intervention in their disputes, by multiplication of formal agreements S. 13. AAvith them, by locating troops at a distance from the fortifications of Aden, or by any excessive readiness to resort to expeditions out of all pro portion, whether immediate or indirect, to either the occasions for them or to any clear advantage to he gained by them. 3. If, as Elis Majesty’s Government have decided, the main purpose of the recent delimi tation is achieved by the fixing of a line beyond which Turkish troops or agents cannot advance, I submit to your Excellency the following propo sitions as well fitted to carry out our decision. So far as the Turkish frontier is concerned, it is in the highest degree desirable that the importance of trespasses across the line, which are neither serious nor deliberate, should not he exaggerated, and, should a protest be required, it would naturally be by way of action at Constantinople. Outside the territory of British India and within a limited area of the Protectorate similar to that formerly known on the Somali coast as the &lt;s ten-mile limit,” internal disturbances would call for interposition. But beyond that line our Agent should be careful to avoid every step that might lead us into military or political entanglements, without the express sanction of the Secretary of State. A railway to Dthali and a cantonment or sanatorium there, should be considered as outside the contemplation of the Government. This being so, the large body of troops now stationed at Dthali should he with drawn, leaving only a sufficient escort for the Political Officer so long as he may remain there. 4. The retention of a Political Officer at Dthali was originally provisional. In September 1904 my Predecessor assented to the proposal of the Government of India “ as a temporary measure, to “ retain a British officer and a small body of troops / “ at Dthali.” This assent he limited to one year, requesting that after the expiry of that time he should be informed as to the existence of “ any “ real necessity for maintaining the official and his “ escort at Dthali.” In November 1905, however, he accepted the reasons of the Government of India for making it permanent. In view of the change of circumstances which will be the result of the present instructions, His Majesty’s Govern ment are satisfied that the arrangement need not be regarded as a permanent one, and that it will be sufficient if the Political Agent is permitted to visit Dthali temporarily and for special purposes as occasion may require. For the present I leave it to your Excellency to decide when, after the retirement of the troops, the Political Officer and his escort should be withdrawn. 5. The despatch of postal runners or agents of the British Government into the interior is to be as much as possible avoided. Any project for disarming the tribes in the nine cantons should be dismissed from serious consideration. Punitive expeditions for offences committed during thedemarcation, and not punished then and there, are now out of the question. No demonstration alon^ the frontier, whether demarcated or not, seems to he needed, and, without previous reference to me, no attempts should he made to conclude tresh treaties. 0. I trust that these propositions may commend themselves to vour Excellency, as principles to be pressed upon the attention of the Government ot Bombay, and as matter for instructions to the Resident whom your Excellency has appointed to Aden. Anv other policy might draw^ us into a re petition on another scene of the recent transactions in Somali Land.

I am directed to forward herewith, Letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. C.—106&gt; da ed the 7th March 1014. Letter to the Political Resident, Aden, No. 1910, dated the 27th March 1914. for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the correspondence noted in the margin, regarding the destruction of certain boundary pillars along the Amiri border in the Aden Hinterland. 2. In recent correspondence the Political Resident has reported that the Imam (Imam Saiyid Yahiya bin Hamid-ud-din of Sanaa) has been entrusted with the administration of Yemen, Information however as to the arrange ments between the Turks and the Imam is very meagre. Already there are \ indications that the boundary demarcated will not be respected by the Imam | if he is given full powers in the Yemen. I am to suggest that an endeavour I should be made to obtain authentic information through the usual diplomatic channels as to how far the administration of the Yemen has been entrusted to the Imam. It is frequently necessary for the Political Resident, Aden, to enter into communication with the representative of the Turkish Government in the Yemen, as in the case of the complaints of the alleged exactions in Nawa 'which was dealt with in the Government of India’s despatch No. 22 (Secret), dated the 5th March 1914, and the Governor in Council thinks that it is proper that he should know officially with whom he has to communicate. No. C.—103, dated Aden Residency, the 7th March 1914. From— Major-General Sir James A. Bell, K.C.V.O., Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, Bombay. I have the honour to state, for the information of Government, that reports having been received of boundary pillars dismantled, a special Shaikh was deputed to see them. He has seen 13 pillars along the Amiri border. Of these No. 4 has been half of it broken, while No. 8 has been totally demolished. From pillars Nos. 5, 6 and 11 stones have been removed and likewise from pillar No. 13, but the people of Ad-Dokkam have repaired this pillar of their own accord. 2. It is impossible to say by whose hands this damage has been done. A month and half ago a band of Zeidis from the Imam’s side were brought up Jabal Jihaf by Shaikh Mukbil Nagi Az Zindani, the Turkish nominee on that hill before our advent in those parts. The people of the hill resented this intrusion and the Zeidis removed. This shows a certain tendency on the Imam’s part to move our way, or perhaps rather an inclination of certain of our non-stipendiaries to seek the Imam’s aid in order to force our hands to give them monthly doles. I believe the Zindani Shaikh to be a man of straw, hut this proximity of Zeidi soldiery to our border is the result of a disposition on the Turks’ part to cede to the Imam some portion of the administration of the Yemeni provinces contiguous to our border—and is a fact that is likely to cause us anxiety in the future. i 3. In this connection I would invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Government letter No. 1092, dated the 7th February 1907, and would suggest that as in 1906 the Shaikhs concerned may be told to repair the broken pillars. But in view of the deputation of Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob to meet the Turkish official on the Haushabi-Turkish border (whenever that has been arranged), I would strongly urge the desirability of extra troops being | sent with him to march along within our border in order to prove to Turk and Arab that we have a stake in the country and are not indifferent to the interests of our stipendiaries there. I do not anticipate any trouble by such peaceful penetration of our own limits: on the contrary to remain for ever in Aden is to encourage the Imam or disaffected Arabs to further acts of aggression which would have far-reaching and mischievous effects.1 i 2 No. 1910, dated Bombay Castle, the 27th March 1914 (Confidential). From—L. Robertson, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Political Resident at Aden. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. C.—106, dated the 7th March 1914, and in reply to inform you that Government approve of your proposal that the damaged boundary pillars should be repaired by the Shaikhs concerned. 2. There is no information to show by whom the damage to the pillars has been done, but it would appear not to be unconnected with the recent incursion of the Zeidis from the Imam’s side of the border, although the evidence ol this is far from conclusive. The disposition of the Imam to move towards our border should be carefully watched and information of any further incursions should be furnished to Government as soon as it can be obtained. It is recog nised that it may be difficult to obtain authentic information on the subject, but it is hoped that the friendly tribes in the vicinity will be able to assist in the matter. It would also be useful if more precise information than that hitherto available could be obtained as to how far the Turks have entrusted t ic administration of the Yemen to the Imam. 3. As regards your proposal to send with Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob when he goes to meet the Turkish representative on the border extra troops for the purpose of patrolling the border, I am to invite your attention to paragraph o f of the despatch No. 20 (Secret), dated the 4th May 1906, from His Majesty s l Secretary of State for India, a copy of which was forwarded to you with Government endorsement No. 92 M., dated the 1st June 1906. It will be observed that Lord Morley laid down that no demonstration along the border seemed to be needed. *It will be necessary to send an escort suited to the occasion with Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob, but until previous sanction is obtained you should refrain from proceedings likely to be regarded as a demonstration. Meanwhile, Government would be glad to know what escort would be suitable to despatch with Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob, and what extra troops would be required to carry out your proposal to patrol the border.1914.

From—C. C. Watson, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 2487, dated the 19th April 1913, I am ( directed to forward, herewith, a copy of a memorandum No. 192 C., dated the V 14th May 1913, from the Political Resident, Aden, forwarding, with its accompaniments, notes by Major II. F. Jacob, First Assistant Political Resi dent, Aden, on his visit to the Haushabi-Turkish border. 2. The Government of Bombay consider it advisable that the dispute between the Haushabi Sheikh and the Turkish Sheikh A1 Wajhihi should be settled as soon as possible, and would suggest that His Majesty’s Secretary of State should be asked to take the necessary action to secure the co-operation of the Turkish Government on the lines indicated by the Political Resident, Aden. It appears probable that, if the Turkish authorities agree to this procedure, it will be easy to arrive at a settlement. 3. It has been pointed out to Major Jacob that, in writing to Muhammad Pasha-bin-Nasir Mukbil of Mavia, he exceeded his instructions which were to report upon the situation only. Notes on a trip to the Haushabi-Turkish border to report on alleged Turkish encroachments there in terms of Government of Bombay’s telegram, dated the 20th February 1913. I left Aden for Lahej on 10th April and arrived same day. Left Lahej 11th and arrived at Nobat Dukaim. Left Nobat Dukaim on 12th and arrived Musemir. Left Musemir on 13th and arrived in a few hours at Kufuf on border. 2. My escort consisted of a Jemadar and 44 camel sowars of Aden Troop and was commanded by Captain S. Perry, R.A., while the Maxim Gun Detachment was in charge of Lieutenant Binny of the 18th Infantry. Captain M. A. Kureishi, I.M.S., was in medical charge of the troops. I am much indebted to these officers for the great assistance they have given me. 3. To facilitate an accurate enquiry and to obviate an ex parte presentment of the case I wrote to Muhammad Pasha-bin-Nasir Mukbil of Mavia asking if he would be able to meet me and state the Turkish case. He wrote a courteous letter, but replied that, in the absence of his superior’s orders, he could not come. He wrote, however, to the Mutasarrif of Taiz hard by. I waited at Kufuf from the 13th afternoon to 17th morning, but the Pasha being still unable to come and as it was expensive to maintain my standing camp, I was compelled after visiting the disputed areas to strike my tents and move downwards to Aden. On the 17th I arrived at Aulaki where I had to meet the Haushabi Sultan on political matters in connection with the safeguarding of his trade routes, and I have made certain proposals in a separate report. On 20th I left for Musemir. On 21st I arrived at Nobat Dukaim, and 22nd at Lahej and left afterwards for Sheikh Othman and Aden which was reached that same evening. 4. Regarding the disputes between the Haushabi Sultan and the Turkish Arab Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Manassar, generally known as A1 Wajhihi, we should remember that when we left the Hinterland in 1907 this man Ai Wajhihi was even then the “ troublefete,” nor has he ceased to deserve that description ; his pinpricks are constant. I append the translation of a document exchanged between the British and Turkish Commissioners respecting non-interference with right of real property, &amp;c., on both sides the broder. This is the principle on which all2 dispute should he decided. Had this principle heeu strictly obse^ed, there would he no ground to-day for the bad blood ^evinced. It indeed has special reference to this very terrain. It is marked B There remains the vexed claim of tithes which on the principle of Govern ment of India’s letter No. 2159 E.-B., dated ^ 13th June 190 7 , paragraph 2, should be paid to the authority within whose jurisdiction the lands are situated ^ (I append copy of this letter* and mark • Not printed. it “ C ”). This principle would seem to be applied in the document letter “ B These tithes the Haushabi Sultan cannot recover on lands that are on his side the border, and to be brief the disputed points relate to lands in two specific areas. These I will treat of in detail. 5 (a) With reference to lands at the village or Aresmeh in the vicinity of pillar XL VILI. —The description of the boundary shows that line passes between the lands of Shabwa (Haushabi) and Nabu (Turkish) , &amp;c. With regard to Shabwa, the lands are mainly “ Waqf ” and their produce goes, neither side objecting, to the Keeper of the Shrine of the Wall Seddik there situated; but from the other lands there in the possession of the t^tion called the Adthbus, who are Haushabi subjects, and their lands clearly fallen on the Haushabi side of the border, the Sultan derives no income at all. As the Haushabi Sultan, Ali Mana, said to me, “ the Adthbus who are in Aresmeh were, even before the line was drawn, my children and P al&lt; * tithes together with ‘ Dthifa ’ the right of oveidord qua contributions towards entertainment). ^ -jit “ After the delimitations these fields still remained on my side the line, but the husbandmen pay me no tithes. Eor one year, indeed, I was paid, but since then the Wajhihi and Haj Ali-al-Kamaram interfered and the latter is said to have kept the dues in deposit pending the settlement ot the dispute. This the Haj corroborated in my presence. Now it is a fact that the tithes derivable from ex-Haushabi lands in^ this area which have passed over by delimitation to the Turkish side are enjoyed by the Turkish Arabs (though the actual tillers are Haushabi s subjects), and the Haushabi Sultan gets nothing and apparently expects nothing, neither royalty nor Dthifa. . . On the other hand, however, on the most of the lands here the Haushabi is fully entitled to take tithes and everything else, for the lands were his before delimitation, and after, and therefore no Turkish claim can possibly be justi fied ; nevertheless the Turkish Arabs dispute title, and the Haj, to preserve peace, has temporarily held receipts in deposit. On “ Waqf ” lands the Haushabi puts forward no claim, nor does the Wajhihi. (6) There remain lands by the Wajhihi’s own village near Rahwat-al- Najd. The boundary here is described as follows :— “ Erom Lakamat Mimtar (no pillar) the line follows the crest of the range passing the points known as Lakamat Kadiha, Jebel and Lafla to J.akama Busesa (no pillar). Thence it descends the spur by Shaaben and Rahu at-al- Maid to Tawila (pillar in cement) a well-marked point on the range hrtveen the Wadi Naaman and Wadi Fakir. Thence it passes between the villages of Kharanin (Haushabi) and A1 Sarih (Turkish) to Rahwat Usekh , &amp;c., &amp;u It is in the immediate vicinity of Rahwat-al-Najd that the second dispute lies. This hillock of Rahwat-al-Najd was considered by itseH a sort of boundary pillar, and I am told by people there who inhabit the lew and squalid huts on top (these are Haushabi subjects it must be u°ted) that the watershed (Arabice “ Maskab-ul-Ma ”) on both sides-so it was thought bv the Commissioners—would serve to indicate the respective “orders. Ik arrangement is rather unfortunate inasmuch as it is vague in definition and obviously open to misinterpretation. _ With regard to the fields tilled on what is clearly the Haushabi side of the watershed, theie is a difference of opinion as to ownership. ■ He the villages of A! Sarih and Asfal Sh’eb Haham, once Haushabi and now after' i ^ 3 delimitation Turkish, the Haushahi prefers no claims, and even waives (why I do not know) his rights to collect “Dthifa”, “Adab ,, (fines), &amp;c., but alleges, and with truth, that the Wajhihi Sheikh comes across the line at Rahwat-al-Najd and collects there his tithes as overlord. If these lands are on the Haushabi side (which is indisputable) then it is abundantly clear that the tithes should be taken by the Haushabi, and the Wajhihi’s claim that the lands were originally his and are so now, even if true, can give him no title to collect tithes t though “ Hthifaand such like may be admissible, and this because the Line cannot upset rights of real property, &amp;c. The Turkish claim to tithes, then, is obviously inadmissible. The Haushabi, however, alleges (the mediator Haj Ali being witness) that these particular lands in dispute, though they formerly were the Wajhihi's, passed from his hands by sale to the Haushabi, and that the Wahkeba, his (Hushabi’s) whilom subjects, who now reside in As fal Sheb Mahani and A1 Sarih (villages by delimination that have gone over to Turkish side) actually hold these documents, but through fear of the Wajhihi Sheikh’s displeasure are loth to produce them in evidence. If this is true, the Wajhihi has no valid claim for royalty, Hthifa, Adab or anything else, whereas he claims everything and would exclude the Haushabi. Haj Ali-al-Kamarani is a Turkish subject, who came to the village of Kharanin (Haushabi) after the delimitation was concluded. He confirms this sale to the Haushabi, but says that he has kept the receipts qua tithes, &amp;c., in deposit against the settlement of the dispute. 6. To sum up, tithes are rightly to be collected by the authority on whose side the lands lie, while other dues should go to the original landlord in terms of the agreement I have cited and marked “ B ”. The Turkish Arab Sheikh Wajhihi disallows this procedure qua lands on Haushabi soil, and for lands fallen on his own side he claims not only tithes (to which he is entitled), but protests against the Haushabi’s collection of “ Hthifa ”, “ Adab ”, and all else. i 7. I am of opinion that Haj Ali-al-Kamarani is an interested party. He is located in a Haushabi village whence he collects all dues, and he is very much venerated by the whole country-side on both sides the border and he trades on this veneration to favour the Turkish nominee (the Wajhihi)—he himself being a Turkish subject—and to hoodwink the Haushabi Sultan whose hospitality to the holy man lends colour to the belief that the latter will be biassed in his favour. I give a translation of a letter written by Muhammad Pasha-bin-Nasir Mukbil of Mavia to this Haj Ali, which, while showing the Haji’s power and influence in this district, will also prove this Pasha’s disinclination seriously to confront the disputes in view to a definite settlement. This is marked letter “ B”. 8. The only remedy, in my opinion, is for Government to refer the matter to Constantinople and to ask the Turkish Government to depute an officer to meet me in the two disputed areas, where, if such officer were given full powers to treat the question in a conciliatory spirit, I guarantee the disputes would be settled in a couple of days. The principle of action is clear as the sun. If this be not done, the ill-feeling and resentment will continue, and I feel sure that the Haushabi people who are of a bellicose temperament will not be constrained much longer to hold off their hands, and fighting will ensue. We have counselled them to be patient and await our decision in the matter, and the Sultan has been patient, but now that the area has been visited and hopes of every settlement have been awakened, I will not guarantee peace being preserved. One can hardly expect the Sultan to be cajoled any longer by exhortations to keep the peace. V T4 Early action is imperative and August would be a capital time to go back there. ^ The inhabitants of the Hinterland were very friendly and 'lad to see us again in their midst. H. E.

B Translation of document exchanged between British and Turkish Commissioners, respecting non-interference with rights of real property, water and grazing on either side of the boundary. The work of delimitation between the two Governments does not imply any interference with the proprietary rights of the inhabitants on either side of the boundary. In the future, as in the past, the inhabitants on the side of y / ( e 9 &gt; Canton of Kamaira) shall continue to enjoy all rights of real property, pasturage and water which they enjoyed on the (e.g. Haushabi) side, and similarly the inhabitants on the (e.g., Haushabi) side of the boundary shall continue to enjoy all rights of real property, grazing and water that they formerly enjoyed on the {e.g.. Canton of Kamaira) side of the boundary; similarly all matters of “Makf ” will follow prescribed usage, free from any interference from either side. t r Hated (Muhammadan and European date in Arabic).

With reference to what you, sir, have written, that we should depute one or two reliable and trustworthy persons to see the border on our behalf and that such persons should be wise, thoughtful and reasonable, be it not hidden from you, sir, that^ your servant places no confidence or reliance on any one and besides there is no one here who could efficiently act for us in case we deputed him. In fact, we trust and rely on you alone. Your presence in these parts is sufficient and we agree to whatever you think fit. We do not oppose your opinion at all. Y'our honour has brought us all together; the Haushabis and ourselves have united and they and we have identical interests both with5 regard to our affairs and respective countries. He who desires to renew the troubles, the roots of which have been eradicated by yourself in such away that our words and actions have hut one aim and end, while sincere friendship A, lla ?| been planted in our hearts, shall harm no one but himself, and he will certainly be brought to his senses. If it pleases God, after the departure of the Imperial troops, when we hope to have a brief leisure perhaps a month or less, we shall accompany you to any place you may desire and we shall then meet our friend Sultan AH Mam and the Amir. Through your good offices no room will be left to evil- doers to interfere between them and us. They and we have become one soul in one body. The credit for this is due to God and you.

The Accountant-General, Bombay, in submitting, for sanction, detailed bills of expenditure incurred by the Political Resident, Aden, during April 1905, pointed out that the sanction of the Government of India was necessarry to a monthly recurring charge of 20 dollars paid to Haitham Hussein, as the monthly allowance of Sheikh Ali Bohsin Askar for the months of January, February and Iff arch 1905, amounting to Rs. 82-8, and also for any similar charges 9 which might be incurred in future. The Political Resident, to whom the matter was referred for report, explains that Sheikh Ali ! ohsin Askar was of considerable service to the Boundary Commission, and that in consequence of this, General Baitland, the late Political Resident, on the 14th July 1903, undertook to make him a present of 20 dollars a month so long as his behaviour and that of the Bausatta clan, continued to be satisfactory. In reply to a further reference the Political Resident states that Shaikh Ali lohsin Askar is theson of lohoin Askar and nephew of All Askar, the ruling Eakib of the lausatta clan, and that there is nothing on the records of the Residency to warrant the suggestion that the undertaking given to Sheikh Ali I.ohsin Askar by General Faitland was intended to be a paper tc support his claim to receive an allowance of 20 dollars out of the stipend of 50 dollar s paid to these two brothers under Vide Foreign Deptt. letter Ilo. 64-}^,: dated the 6th January 1904. : the Protectorate Treaty entered into with them on the 3rd July 1903.

From To The Assistant Secretary to the liovernment of India in the Foreign Department. The Hon’ble Sir S.W, Sdgerley, K.C.V.O., G.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter Ho.7408, dated the 18th Eovember 1905, reporting that General iaitland, the late Political Resident at Aden, on the 14th July 1903, undertook to make Sheikh Ali iohsin Askar a present of £0 dollars a month for so long as his behaviour and that of the I ausatta clan continued to be satisfactory; and requesting sanction to a charge of Rs. 8£—6 on account of payments made in pursuance of the above promise for the months of January, February and larch 1905, and to the disbursement of like sums on the same account for future months. 2. I am to convey the sanction of the Government of India to the action of General l.aitland in the matter, and to the proposals now put forward, on the understanding- that the allowance will not be a regular stipend granted under any treaty or engagements, but merely a personal allowance contingent on the good behaviour ofC ® j Ali Mohsin Askar and the Mausatta clan. ' • &gt;. 3. I am at the same time to invite your attention to Ueneral ^ laitland's letter Do. 250, dated the 9th August 1903, in which it is stated that this allowance was to be paid out of 'Durbar Presents'’ and to request that a corresponding reduction may be effected in the grant for'Durbar Presents' to which, it is presumed, the expenditure has hitherto been charged. 4. Attention is also invited to Colonel Wahab’s letter Bo.312, ' datod the 3rd 1903, in which it is^nentioned that Sheikh Ali kohsin Askar intimated that the allowance was only granted to him while engaged in the business of Government, which appears to the Government of India to render this grant a special one, and not merely a life grant.1 * No. 113-P., dated Bombay Castle, the 22nd June 1C06.

There would appear to he no reason why the special allowance made to Ali M.ohsin Askar should not now permanently cease. (Sd.) J. R. CARTER, Major, for Political Resident, Aden. Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar, the subject of Government Resolusion No. 222, of 11th January 1906, left my tent the other day in a rage. He was apparently displeased at not receiving an individual interview with His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, at Aden, (to this he had no title), and he was furthermore aggrieved with my expressed inability to give him presents, in anticipation of his future marriage with a connection of the Amir of Dthala. He went to the Sha’ib country and convened a conclave of their Sheikhs and Akils, including our stipendiary Ali Mani, the Saqladi. He advised them to throw off their allegiance. They refused, with the exception of one Minor Akil. Ali Mohsin’s words to me were “ I was the first one to approach Govern ment. I can stop all your friends in Yafa from coming in, and can urge the abrogation of the friendship and the restoration of the Treaty deeds.” I wrote to Ali Mohsin objecting to the words he had used, and reminded him that he was mistaken in believing the affairs of Yafa could be managed through his sole medium. 1 asked him to show cause why his allowance should not be stopped, as he well knew the dole he received was conditional upon friendliness and good behaviour, which his words now clearly denied. I awaited, I said, his reply before taking action. He gave no immediate reply, save to knock down pillar No. XYI, (of sheet 1 South Arabia Anglo-Tnrkish boundary map), and afterwards he wrote saying what he had done. His letter was couched in most discourteous and unfriendly terms. He has but few friends in Upper Yafa, thanks to his pride, and the con stant boast that he was of the house of Askar, the Fathers of Yafa, for he has always accentuated to the people of that country that he is the sole medium of2 mmm their past and future intercourse with the British Government. The Askar family, of which house we have two stipendiaries, have been addressed by me on the subject of their relative’s unfriendliness, and a letter has been received in the meantime from them, in which they refer to a report received of a breach m my relations with Ali Mohsin and they give the assurance of their continued confidence in the British Government. At the same time they narrate Ali Mohsin’s complaint made to them of loss of respect at our hands. I recommend that Ali Mohsin’s action ipso facto demands loss of allowance, either in perpetuity, or till such time as he, of his own accord, returns. I hear he is already repentant, and finds his isolation has lowered his prestige. I ^ do not recommend action that would evince any suggestion of Ah Mohsin» importance. 2. As to restoration of this pillar, I would say that Sheikh Mutahhar Ali of Shaib, who has the oversight of this and the other two pillars in the vicinity of his country, reports to me that No. IX (on Jabal Jamimeh) was, shortly after the departure of the British Commissioners, dismantled by some one unknown, and Colonel Wahab, to whom the matter was reported, advised the Sheikh, so he tells me, to let it alone for the time being. Again No. XIY has j also been tampered with by some one of the Sha ib country acting, in my opinion, at the instance of an ill-wisher of ours in Lpper Yala . Shaib is an appanage of the Nakib family of Upper Tafa, viz., the Askar our stipendiaries, but I do not attribute the work to these Sheikhs, who aie most friendly. 3. Reference is invited to correspondence over Residency No. 5982 of 3rd October 1905, and in particular to the telegram of 5th September 1905 from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy. Here the subject matter concerns^ the boundary pillars along the Sanah-Kataba frontier, but is germane, I think, to the point under discussion. Sir N. O’Conor endorsed therein the earlier recommendations of the Govern- xxf ment of India, vide their letter No. 1619 of 30th April 1905, to the addies® of Bombay Government), that the Amir of Dthala should be directed to rai^e the bight of aU the pillars along his border, which were not constructed by the Turkish authorities, and to keep them white washed and numbered according to the map. Sir N. O’Conor goes on to show the channel through which Notification, when circumstances demand its issue, should be made. 4. I would, at the outset, say that I am not aware that any pillars along thia frontier can be shown as constructed by the Amir of Dthala, and as this may affect the orders already passed, I seek further direction, for I am convinced that Mr. EitzMaurice rightlv gauged the feelings and attitude of the Turks, were the Amir of Dthala allowed independent action, even so far as raising the height of existing pillars. I have often reported the contemptuous treatment in correspondence of the Amir’s style. The boundary having been delimited between two responsible Governments, and not between Turks and the Amir of Dthala, any ex-parte action by the Amir, or by us, will, I believe with Mr. EitzMaurice, especially at this time when An»lo*Turkish relations are somewhat strained, prove to be impolitic. 5 I now come to the three pillars tampered with in Shaib. Here we have no one, even of the Amir’s status, but an irresponsible Sheikh only, and moreover we are dealing with pillars dismantled. It is true that an agreement dated 24th October 1903, was concluded between the then Political Officer and he said Sheikh Mutahhar Ali by which in return for a monthly allowance of $ 7, to signalise the Sheikh’s friendly attitude towards the British Commission, he was entrusted with the protection of the boundary pillars bordering his country, and was expressly bound, if these were broken, to restore them and to keep them in repair. The Sheikh is willing to undertake this work forthwith. 6. I believe, on the analogy of the Sanah-Kataba pillars, that this is a matter for Government orders, and am supported in this view, as I note thatthe question as to the channel by which all communications respecting herder disputes on the recently demarcated frontier should be made, is still under Government’s consideration, vide Bombay Government’s No. 7095 of 3rd November 1905. (below correspondence on this point, all of which was received by me with Residency No. 6990 of llth November 1905). Will not Ibis decision largely direct the modus operandi with respect to the pillars along the entire line. The ex-parte repair or improvement of pillars will probably lead to dispute. 7. I would hazard the opinion of the probability that the decision, as to the channel of communication, may direct attention to the consideration of the extent of line demarcated, and so revive the discussion of an official ratifi cation of that portion of the line between the river Bana and the desert—a theme which His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India does not care at this stage to press ? {vide despatches received with Government of Bombay’s No. 3182 (Political) of 27th April 1906). 8. May I suggest alternative courses, viz., either letter sent by me to Kaim Makam, Kataba, informing him of the fact of pillars dismantled, border ing Shaib territory, and suggesting repair in the presence of representatives of both sides, or, while bringing the fact to his notice, (this seems in any case desirable), stating that I propose doing nothing in the matter, but await with him the orders of our respective Governments.

(Sd). J. R. CARTER, Major, for Officiating Political Resident, Aden. Memorandum on Upper Yafa Affairs. Kahtan is not even the titular Sultan of Tafa’-a»-Sufal, in the sense that the other of our stipendiaries there are dependent on him. They are none of them so dependent. Kahtan bin Omer was a mere Sheikh as the others, and the stylo of Sultan is of recent adoption, and gives him no precedence. His brother Saleh bin Omer, and also Haidara bin Muhammad, were in receipt of Turkish stipends before our treaties in Upper Yafa, were concluded. These three are scions of the house of Sheikh Ali of Barbara, which, becoming divided against ^ i ^ ^P ersed - Haidara sought the protection of the Mausatta Clan, the self- styled lathers of Yafa, of which clan we have now two stipendiaries, while Kahtan and Saleh bin Omer, the two brothers, found a domicile with the Dthubi section or whom we have two stipendiaries at this time. ’ Kahtan has no pre-eminence, save that of name, in Upper Yafa’. Had he influence, his rehabilitation would long since have been effected, or rather his deposition would never have been effected. This has been done by his own brother Saleh, who holds the confidence of the clan. In Upper Yafa’ we have the spectacle of a vast democracy. No one of our stipendiaries owes allegiance to Kahtan, or to Saleh. Each head Sheikh has his own following.My count against Kahtan is a strong one, viz., he has ceased to be de facto ” and “ de jure' Sultan of the Section he represents, but not solely re presents for our other Dthubi stipendiaries have an equal representation. It is true that Kahtnn cannot be charged with any specific violation of the terms of his treaty with us, but equally true that as a deposed Chief, he cannot uphold that treaty’s obligations. He is a mere nonentity at this time. If he is rein stated, it will probably be by the aid of Haidara bin Muhammad, the collateral branch of the Harhara family, and in that event, this latter would ask from Government recognition to the extent of a stipend, which, as stated above, he receive, witli Kahtan s brother, from the lurks. Kahtan has been deposed by his people. We have not guaranteed his restoration to office, but have offered him 3,000 to effect that end. To continue his stipend, is to be little the value of a stipend, and the status of a recipient. Kahtan should bow to his nominees’ will. I have before stated that, to be interested in his recovery to power, and yet to see the continuance ot hope frustrated, is inimical to our prestige in the whole of Upper Yafa , and surrounding country, which we would know and influence. A friend to Gov ernment ; deposed because he sought friendship; his stipend continued in proof of our friendship, and no active steps taken to reinstate him—all this is preiudicial to our name as a Great Government. If we will not forcibly rein state him—and this we will not wish to do—we shall do better to fall in line with the people’s choice, and make it our own. It is more politic so. “ Ze Eoi est mort, t 7 ive le Eoi'. As regards the possible residuum of Turkish claim to Upper Yafa , or a part of it, the status we hold since 1873 in this tract as a whole; the known aversion of all Upper Yafa’ to the Turks ; the impracticability of Turkish intrigue with one clan (Kahtan’s Dthubi), admitted on all hands to be without the pale of Turkish influence ; the fact again that llube’ten is not Kahtan’s own appanage, but the perquisite of the house to which he belongs, while other Ifafa’ clans claim rights of revenue therein ; again that these Sheikhs of Kube’ten are bitterly anti-Turkish—all this goes to minimise the possibility of any An^lo-Turkish differences in Upper Yafa. Saleh bin Omer—Kahtap’s brother—is said to be this time collecting the dues that fall to the Sultan’s family in Rube’ten. It is only too true, as stated in Chief Secretary to Government of Bombay letter No 8304 of 22nd December 1905, lo be probable, that we have accepted many of the stipendiaries in Upper Yafa’ at their own valuation. Many are men of straw, and all count our friendship (money) at a distance. I do not see we can step in to effect Kahtan’s re-establishment, even by summoning a con vention of Upper Yafa’ Chiefs to that end. In the first place, Kahtan is nothing to the other stipendiaries, nor they to him, and secondly, if any unan imity o C f counsels prevailed, and the Chiefs of Upper Yafa were thereafter unable to effect their purpose, it would be commonly bruited that the power of the British Government at the back of the convention had received a diplomatic defeat. The result : the further lowering of our prestige. If the Chiefs were to combine on their own initiative, which is extremely problema tical well and good, but we should, in my opinion, hold aloof, and accept the vox nopuli as the vox Dei, why should we intermeddle in a purely tribal affair. I again recommend that Kahtan be paid the balance of Its. 1,500 lying in our treasure chest, and be expressly given two clear, months in which to recover his position, the stipend to be discontinued at the end of that term, if he,still remain outside his Sultanate. Such stimulus to action is very necessary. . Now he finds he can draw our bounties month by month without being the regning Sultan. With regard to the other Chiefs of this country, I would recommend friendly relations all round. But in this connection record my opinion that no great ini g for UpP er Yafa * f riend8hi P need beexhibited. This does not mean a visible demonstration of indifference to their importance far from it; divided interests are the order of the day in Upper Yafa.’ It is an occasion for practising tie adage “ Divide el impera.' Further, I believe our prime duty is towards 2tracts below, botli nearer to us, and leading to Upper Yafa* and the North-East line. I refer principally to Lower Yafa,’ from where the Upper Yafa’ Chieftains have sprung, and whose Sultan is on bad terms with us, and at constant friction with his neighbour, the Fadthli Sultan. I despair of consolidation of our sphere as opposed to that of the Turks, so long as restlessness and the spirit of coolness prevails this side our border. Our true and moral border lies at that point where our influence and friendship ceases to run, and there is no pressing need to be blind to all save the Turkish and North-East border, while the case is as I have sketched it.

I consider that it is very important that tne boundary pillars along the Kataba frontier should he kept in proper repair by the Amir of Dthala and some of them raised if necessary.

It will probably be time emough to make such a notifi cation if they raise objections or make enquiciesjbut if the Indian Government prefer that they should be informed of such repairs, I think that the Embassy rather than the Political Officer at Dthala should be charged with the duty.

They suggest that the difficulties anticipated by Mr. Fitzmaurice might be obviated by a formal notification to the Turkish authorities.

[2119 p-1) * To India Office, July 10; India Office, August 2, 1905. f Mr. Fitzraaurice, August 8, 1905. J [This Document is the Property of His Briummii Majesty's Govemmentj ARABIA.« If LONDON. August 8th. 1905. The India Office’s despatch of August 2nd. to the Foreign Office deals with three points 1. The measures deemed necessary to prevent the apprehended' total disappearance of the boundary pillars in the neighbourhood of Kataba; 2. The question of a formal notification to the Porte that the Amir of Dthala will bo directed to raise trie Lritish-constructed pillars along his border to a height of o ft. (as advised by Major Tier ewe the r in his letter of November 15th. 1904), to clear the brush Jungle around them and to keep them whitewashed and num bered according to the map; and 3. That, pending arrangements of a permanent character, all communications between authorities on either side of the border in regard to disputes in that part of the frontier (i.e. Kataba) should be ma.de through the channel of the Political Officer at Dthala. The incident which gave rise to this corres pondence -correspondence was at first reported by Major Merewethe to have taken place at a spot three miles inside the Amir of Dthala’s border and looked like a serious viola tion of British territory. It was subsequently ascer tained that it took place at Habil A1 Khadar or on the actual boundary line, and that (paragraph 2 of the Gov ernment of India's letter of December 29th. 1904 to the Secretary of State for India) the Arabs were settled on the Turkish side of the frontier, but that some of them were pursued an unknown distance across the border by the Turks sent to arrest them. Major Merewether then (in his letter of November 15th. 1904 to the 1st. Assistant Resident at Aden) com- mented on the invisibility from each other of adjoin ing boundary pillars' and made some suggestions (e.g. raising the height of the pillars to 8 ft. etc., etc.) with a view to preventing the recurrence of such inci dents as that reported by him. The Boundary Commission in its No. 261 of May 26th. 1903 (I am quoting from memory) pointed out that any boundary line drawn across the ground in the neigh bourhoodneighbourhood of Kataba must be defective, but the mea sures proposed by I.Iajor Merewether cannot, I think, prevent the pursuit across of the border of fugitive Arabs. Increasing the number of pillars, or heighten ing the existing ones built by the British will not necessarily prevent pursuing Turkish soldiers or Gen darmes from overstepping the borderline. Again the 'visibility of adjoining pillars' seems all but unattainable. Pillars 8 ft. high will not be visible over scrub jungle or babultrees 12 feet or more in height, while the natural annual growth of such trees and scrub must also be taken into account. The intervening jungle cannot well be cleared away, as it is valuable to the local Arabs for camel-grazing etc., and its removal would entail endless disputes and a tedious process of indemnifying the owners on both sides. The distances between the pillars, as given in the Aden Resident's letter of January 18th. 1905 to the Political Secretary to the Government of Bombay, are very much exaggerated, in one case the distance set down as 2 miles being actually less than l mile. Ina doml-official letter to the Resident of Aden confirm- ing my tele gram to him of February 1st. 1905, I pointed this out and gave a comparative table of the distances as reported to him and the actual distances as measur ed on the boundary map. This was not apparently trans* rnltted to the Government of Bombay. Again, the Boundary Commission being an interna tional one, Turkish 'amour propre* demanded that a cer tain preportion of the pillars should be erected by the Turkish Commission. While those built by the British Commission were constructed of cutstone and Portland cement, those built by the Turks were made of rough stone and lime, being consequently less durable. Were the Amir of Dthala to whitewash, number and raise to 3 ft. or more, only the British pillars, the ■visibili ty of adjoining pillars etc.' would not be secured un less the Turkish authorities could be induced to alter uhe pillars built by them in a corresponding fashion, while, as mentioned above, the intervening growth would always be an obstacle. 2. A formal notification to the Turkish authori ties concerning the steps which it is intended the Amirof Dthala Siiould take to maintain the pillars in repair would not, I fear, prove acceptable to the Porte. The Ottoman Government cannot bring itself to look upon any Arab chief as independent. It has shown the greatest reluctance in official correspondence to apply the Libia of w Amir* to the Dthala Cnief, whom it styles the 'Snekn of Dthala' and it would presumably show a simi lar reluctance to recognize his acting in an official capacity in such matters as altering, numbering, etc., the boundary pillars. 3. As regards the proposal that the Porte should give general orders to the sub-governor of Kataba to communicate officially with the Political Officer at Dthala in matters of border disputes, difficulties are, I fear, to be anticipated also on this score. By ac cepting the Sultan's proposal to delimit the border be tween 'the nine cantons and the province of Taiz* in stead ol the wording of the British Royal Commissions, viz: 'the nine tribes and the Ottoman dominions'. His Majesty's Government tacitly admitted the fiction main tained by the Sultan's Government that the 'nine tribesare in theory 'nine cantons', or subdivisions, of the Ottoman province of Tai z and though the Porte may pro fess to instruct the sub-governor of Kataba to deal of ficially with the British-appointed Political Officer at Dthala, it is not unlikely that such instructions may prove to be evasive and that the Kataba Sub-gover nor will limit his correspondence with the Political Officer at Dthala to informing the latter that he has forwarded his communications to Sana'a or Constanti nople . It would then seen that any unilateral action by us or the Amir of Dthala is likely to be objected to by the Turks, while any joint alteration or improvement of the existing boundary marks will involve procuring an Imperial Irade from the Sultan. Now that the boundary has been laid dov/n and drawn on detailed survey maps any encroachments by the Turks are out of the question, but border incidents such as the violation of or trespass on the existing boundary, especially in cases of the pursuit of fugitive Arabs, may irom time to time occur, though they may not always leadlead to serious questions. When the boundary was being fixed in the neighbour hood of Kataba and the Dakkam, the British Commission succeeded in including on the British side of the line some tracts which at certain seasons of the year become marshy and are frequented by small game, as it was felt that any officers stationed at Dthala might be tempted to cross to the Turkish side of the frontier, thus lead ing to Incidents perhaps of a serious nature. Even still, as these marshes are in close proximity to the border line, it is not impossible that British Officers at Dthala may occasionally be led to overstep the Turk ish boundary in pursuing game. It may then, be ex- i [ I paaignt on tns whols, that iainon trespasses across a i boundary which is totally unlike any European frontier ; should not, where possible, assume the character cf \ international incidents but should bo adjusted on the \ ispot by unofficial friendly communication between the local British and Turkish officials. Should we adopt a rigid attitude in matters of minor trespass by the Turks, the latter may retaliate and their methods in such(Signed) G. H. Fitmuurl ce. such cases are distinctly rougher than ours. I cannot help feeling that had the actual facts been at first correctly reported by Major Lierewether and the correct distances between the pillars given, the present correspondence might not have arisen. The foregoing remarks must, I fear, appear to be almost entirely of a negative character. But the measures suggested by Major Merewethor to prevent the recurrence of an incident at first incorrectly reported to him would not I think have the desired effect, while the consent of the Sultan to any alteration of the ex isting boundary especially by the Amir of Dthala, can only be obtained by tedious negotiation and the exer cise of pressure.—if Sir:- J/t, 0 FOREIGN OFFICE, July 10th, 1905. / With reference to your letter of June 8th trans mitting copies of correspondence relative to certain proposals for the construction of permanent and more easily distinguishable marks of the Aden boundary line near Kataba, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to forward herewith for the information of the Secretary of State for India copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople con taining his observations on the proposals in ques tion. Sir Nicholas O'Conor considers that it would be difficult to reopen with the Porte the question of the more effective demarcation of the frontier and he prefers the course suggested in the letter from the Government of India of April 30th viz. that the Ameer of D’thala should raise the height of those pillars o The Under Secretary of State, India Office.pillars along his frontier which require it and at the sane time clear away the brushwood round them and whitewash them* Mr. Fitzmaurice however who in accordance with His Excellency's suggestion has been consulted by this Department fears that any interference on the part of the Ameer with the pillars will immediately result in his being accused by the Turks of tampering with the boundary. Mr. Fitzmurice also states that the distances between the pillars as given in the letter from the Resident at Aden dated January 18th are incorrect and that the pillars are much nearer to each other than is described.

From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to your letter No. 6644, dated the 28th October 1904 calling upon me to submit proposals for the construction of permanent and more easily distinguishable marks of the boundary line near Kataba, I have the honour to forward copy of a letter No. 4-C., dated the 15th November 1904, on the subject, from the Political Officer, D’thala, who suggests that the pillars should be constructed of cement and interpolating pillars of the same material be inserted.2. On the Amiri border there are 13 pillars (excluding a dome of a shrine called Umr (XXXVII) Ismail and three prominent points on hills recognised as boundary marks), strewn along the boundary line from Jabal (about XXIII) Barkan near Kataba to Jabal Sarir (near XXXIX) in Ilesha, south-west of Katabn, situated at distances varying from half mile to three miles from each other approximately. Most of them are said to be hardly visible from each other owing to the configuration of the ground. This defect can best be removed by interpolating pillars at such intervals as to admit of the next boundary mark being plainly seen on each side from any one mark. Amongst the Amiri pillars the intervening spaces requiring interpolating pillars are:— (1) Between Lakmat Kurbia (no pillar) and Kism Siran (pillar) situated at about 2 miles See May in Secret E., June 1904. Nos. *2.132. f ^ ^ another# (2) Between Habil Zira (pillar) and Nijd Laslum (pillar) situated at about one and a half miles from one another. (3) Between Nijd Laslum (pillar) and Habil Suremi (pillar) situated at about one and a half miles from one another. (4) Between Habil Jurdumi (pillar) and Habil Khadr (pillar) situated at about two miles from one another. (5) Between Habil Dawwar (pillar) and Habil Nus (pillar) situated at about 3 miles from one another. (6) Between Habil Nus (pillar) and Lakmat Turab (pillar) situated at about three miles from one another. (7) Between Habil Hawar (pillar) and Jabal Sarir (no pillar) situated at about 5 miles from one another. 3. The intervening pillars required in these spaces are as follows Two pillars between Lakmat (XXIV) Kurbia and Kism (XXV) Siran. One pillar between Habil (XXVII) Survey map in SecretE., June 1904, No S . 22.132. ^ ^ ( XXVI1I) Laslum. One pillar between Nijd (XXVIII);Lasium and Habil (XXIX) Suremi. Two pillars between Habil (XXXI) Jurdumi and Habil (XXXII) Khadr. Two pillars between Habil (XXXIII) Dawwar and Habil (XXXIV) Nus. Two pillars between Habil (XXXIV) Nus and Lakmat (XXXV) Turab Two pillars between Habil (XXXVIII) Hawar and Jabal (XXXIX) Sarir, one of which to be erected in such a position as to include the fields near Kule’a Sufla to the Dakkam and one between the villages of’Ukeb (Dakkam— British) and Thukhab (Hesha— Turkish). 4. In addition to the Amiri pillars there are four^ pillars along the Haushabi frontier, and the space between them will require interpolating as follows :— 5. Interpolating pillars between Tawila (XLVII) pillar and Uresma ( X LyxH) pillar. Here the boundary line runs across several spurs and traverses nullahs, and in consequence the two pillars are invisible from one another, though the boundary is almost a straight line. Perhaps one on the spot will be able to determine* whether a smaller number of interpolating pillars will suffice. 6. Interpolating pillars between Uresma (XLVIII) pillar and Lakmat (No 296) At-Twvval (conical hills recognised as boundary marks) situated at about one mile from the former. Here the line runs in a zigzag fashion; pillars are only necessary at points where there are sharp turns. 23 (1) Interpolating pillar between Wakdiya (XLIX) pillar fnd Wali (No. 311) Arabi (a mosque recognised as boundary mark) situated at about one and a half mile from one another. (2) Interpolating pillar between Wali Arabi and the pillar of Sha’b Am-Shireh situated at about J mile from one another, but the position of the ground and the low height of the site of the latter /O render them invisible from one anolher. 7. Prom what has been reported above it will be seen that there are— 12 Amiri pillars to be erected. 13 Amiri pillars to be reconstructed. 9 Haushabi pillars to be erected. 4 Haushabi pillars to be reconstructed. The dimensions of the pillars should he 4i feet in diameter at the base by 8 feet m height. The approximate cost of construction as calculated by the Commanding Koval Engineer, amounts to Rs. 3,880. To this it will be necessary to add the cost of an escort which it will perhaps be necessary to furnish tor the protection of the masons. 8. Before any definite steps are taken in the direction suggested it will be necessary to consult the Turkish Government. Some of the pillars were con structed by the Turks and notes describing all the boundary demarcated were exchanged by the Anglo-Turkish Boundary Commission, and these notes will doubtless he modified by the above proposal so far as the number, description and size of the pillars are concerned. r No 4-C.

This is the duty of the Amir, and he should be made to carry it out without waiting for any action on the part of the Turkish authorities. ,0. C, Press, Simla,— No. 172 F. D.—8-6 06,- 44.— ,E. A.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Fort William, the 29 th December 1904. Sir, We have the honour to invite your attention to the correspondence ending with our telegram, dated the 11th November 1901, relative to the violation of the Amiri border by the Turks. 2. A copy of the correspondence on the subject accompanies our letter* but, for the sake of convenience, we may here give a resume of the main facts* On the 21st September 1904, the Political Resident at Aden reported that, under the orders of the Kaimmakam of Kataba, a body of Turks and Arabs surrounded a village, Mazoob Habal-al-Khadar, on the night of 14th September, and seized, along with their cattle and other property, six Turkish subjects wdio had left Shakab, a village on the Turkish side, to settle in Mazoob Habal-al- Khadar, which, they thought, was within Amiri territory. We may explain that Shakab is a Yubi village, and with most of the Yubi villages was left to the Turks. However, at the Amir’s request, in order to give him the west bank of the Wadi Abara or Hapesh, a good deal of the culti vation of this village was left on the British side of the line. Some of the cultivators elected to build their houses in British territory ; but, owing to the fact that the boundary pillars in this neighbourhood are about two and-a-half miles apart and the country is broken, they unfortunately made a mistake, and built them just on the Turkish side of the line. The action of the Kaimmakam w r as taken in spite of Major Mere wether, Political Officer at Dthala, having the previous day requested him not to do anything in the matter, but to represent it officially, when it would be enquired into and adjusted. Notwithstanding this friendly advice, the Turks not only proceeded against the villagers, but continued the pursuit of those who escaped immediate capture into Amiri limits, and as a result the British frontier so recently demar cated was violated in the raid. There are grounds for suspecting that the Kaimmakam acted under instructions from Constantinople, as his powers in matters concerning the British are limited. The Kaimmakam stated to Major Merewether that the Amir of Dthala had enticed away the villagers in question from the Turkish village, but enquiries fail to show anything beyond the fact that the Amir had been approached by the men for permission to settle on his lands in consequence of the treatment they were receiving at the hands of the Turks, and he had consented, somewhat readily perhaps, because he had recently purchased additional land.3. On a consideration of these facts, we desire to submit to His Majesty’s Government the following observations :— (a) We are in accord with His Excellency the Governor of Bombay* in Government an understanding that subjects of either side of the frontier shall be free to settle on the other without let or hindrance and without the fear of such consequences as ensued in the present case; and we would point out the necessity, which appears to us to have been established by the incident, of recognizing the principle, that negotiations in regard to border disputes between the authorities on the British and Turkish side of the boundary alonu: the whole of the demarcated frontier of the Aden hinterland shall, in the future, should occasion arise, be conducted through the channel of the Political Officer at Dthala. (b) We observe from the telegram addressed on 22nd October to the Marquess of Lansdowne by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople that the Turkish Government hold out a hope that the guilty Kaimmakam of Kataba will be removed; and we presume that no further action is contem plated by His Majesty’s Representative until a reasonable opportunity has been given to the Porte to act in accordance with their implied promise. We earnestly trust, however, that, should the latter show signs of an intention to procrastinate or to evade their promise, renewed representations will be made wuth a view to the prompt supersession of the Kaimmakam. (c) We have an undoubted right to demand from the Turkish Government the preliminary surrender to the British local authorities of the Turkish subjects who were pursued across the border into British territory and there arrested. This right might be utilised with a view to bringing pressure on the Turkish Government, but we do not consider that it is necessary, if the Porte prove compliant on the points mentioned under (a) and (6), to insist on any thing more than the mere release of the men and the extension to them of permission to settle on whichever side of the frontier they may prefer. This last demand is perfectly reasonable, since the cultivable land belonging to the hamlet of Shakab lies on both sides of the boundary. (d) The British and Turkish local authorities should at once be authorised to make concerted arrangements for prohibiting the establishment of villages within half a mile of either side of the border and for the erection of inter mediate pillars, between pillars 32 and 33 as well as at any other part of the Amiri border where the nature of the country would make such action advisable. • Vide enclosure No. 8. thinking that the present incident should be made use of to obtain from the Turkish We have the honour to be.

I have just received Captain Merewether’s report on it. Evidently it is dubious whether a portion of Mazoob-al-Khadar is in A miri country, but Captain Mere wether states that there is no doubt that the Amiri boundary was violated by the Turks when the six men were seized. It is further stated by Captain Merewether that orders were received from Taiz for the action of the Kaimmakam. Both Mr. Eitzmaurice and Captain Merewether2 consider that strong representation should be made to the Porte. T concur in this view.'

With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. 3204- / E. B., dated the 26th September 1904, I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a confidential letter No. 173, dated the 21th idem, from the Political Resident, Aden, detailing the circumstances which led to the violation of Amiri territory by the Turks. 2. I am to observe that the detailed facts of the incident as now related emphasise the suggestion already made by this Government and which is supported by General Mason that a strong representation should be addressed to the Porte regarding the violation of the demarcated boundary under the leadership of the Kaimmakam of Kataba, whose removal from office should, His Excellency in Council considers, be insisted upon. From — Major Gkneral H. M. Mason, Political Residentat Aden, To—C. H. A. Hill, Fsq., C.I.E., Actnig Secretary to the Government of Bombay, In continuation of my telegram of the 21st instant, I have the honour to inform you that Major Merewether, in a letter dated the 17th instant from Dthala reports that on the 10th idem he went to Kataha to return the visit of the ram returned his visit, and in the course of conversation he casually mentioned that the Amir of Dthala had enticed away a number of inhabitants of the vil- this that he thought of going after these people and capturing them and their property, and added that he had already attached their lands in Shakhab. Major Merewether requested the Kaimmakam not to take any such steps, and as sured him that if the Amir of Dthala had been guilty of any unjustifiable o r unfriendly act, it would only be necessary for him to represent the circumstance to the British authorities to ensure their doing everything possible to adjust matters. The Kaimmakam thanked Major Merewether, and the subject was dropped. However, on the evening of the 14th instant, after his return to Dth ala, Major Merewether received the information that at 3 a.m. that morning Hizam Abdula As Sayadi, Sheikh of the A1 ’Od country, in Turkish territory, with 50 Arab fighting men and Yuz Pasha with 50 Turkish soldiers, sur rounded Mazoob Habil Al Khadar, captured 6 men, (Turkish subjects) who had left Shakhab and taken up their residence in the former village, and carried off camels, cattle, sheep and goats, etc., belonging to the above 6 men. None of the Amir’s subjects appear to have been molested. The Kaimmakam of Kataba was actually present himself at the time, he having, it is reported, befcre surrounding the village, telegraphed to Taiz and received orders to go and capture the fugitives, punish them, and carry off their goods and animals. Major Mrewether also received a letter from Sheikh Nasir bin Shaif Saif, son of the Amir, complaining of this action of the Kaimmakam, the Amir himself being in the Halmin country at the time. No. 254-P , dated Bombay Castle, the 2nd October 1904. Political Department, No. 173, dated the 24th September 1904. Political Department. Kaimmakam of that place and was cordially received by him. The Kaimma- lage of Shakhab, which is in Turkish territory, and had induced them to settle in Mazooh Habil Al Khadar in Amiri limits : he said he was so annoyed about2. As regards the Kaimmakam’s statement to Major Merewether that the Amir had himself enticed away the people of Shnkhab from Turkish into Amiri territory, that officer states, from enquiries made by him, he has come to the conclusion that what really happened was that these people, like many of the Turkish subjects, were extremely dissatisfied at the treatment they were receiving, and they themselves approached the Amir with the request that they might be allowed to live in his territory. The Amir acceded to this re quest the more readily because lately he has bought lands for himself both in Turkish and Amiri limits, just on one side of the boundary. His intention in allowing these people to settle in Mazoob Hahil Al Khadar was that they should cultivate some of these lands for him. It is possible that the Amir sug gested to the Shakhab people that they should go and live in the village above mentioned, but the information received does not point to this. 3. Major Merewether further states there is a rumour current in Dthala that the Kaimmakam has been told he is to be removed from his office and that he has violated our boundary in this manner in order to create ill-felling between the British and Turkish Governments to spite his own Government. This however Major Merewether considers to be hardly probable. 4. Since he has been in Dthala Major Merewether has made every en deavour to improve our relations with the Turks, especially as regards disputes between Turkish and Amiri subjects. His efforts met with considerable success, and he received a letter from the Mutaserrif of Taiz thanking him for what he had done and assuring him of his cordial co-operation. The action of the Kaim makam of Kataba, as above Reported, was therefore quite inexcusable, especially as he had been informed by Major Merewether on the 10th instant that he had only to represent the matter he complained of officially, and it would be inquired into and adjusted. 5. Such action on the part of the Kaimmakam is not calculated to pre serve the cordial relations between the British and Turkish Governments which it has been our constant endeavour to maintain. I have therefore the hon our to suggest that the Porte be addressed with the view to serious notice being taken of the Kaimmakam’s conduct. 1 6.

In continuation of my letter No. 254-P., dated the 2nd October 1904, and of subsequent telegraphic correspondence, I am now directed to transmit, for the information of the Governor-General in Council, copy of the full report of General Mason of the incident of the 14th September, which involved the violation of the recently demarcated boundary of the Amiri territory. 2. The history of events seems briefly to be as follows:—On the 10th September Major Merewether specially requested the Kaim Mukam of Kataba, with a view to avoiding any violation of the boundary or any inter ruption of the cordial relations existing between the Turkish and the British authorities to refrain from taking any action in regard to certain Turkish subjects who were said to have deserted Shakhab and placed themselves under the Amir of Dthala. (It is of importance to note, with reference to the note originally existing as to the precise position of the hamlet to which they resorted, that these deserters, at any rate, thought they were proceeding to a place on the British side of the boundary line.) General Mason and Major Merewether, who are both new to the Agency, were, not unreasonably, misled by the Kaim Mukam who himself stated that a neutral zone of about 80 yards had been arranged for on each side of the boundary line. That orticial, however, had apparently satisfied himself that the house he desired to raid was within his boundary before taking action. 3. It is clear on the information now available that the hamlet which was the object of the Turkish raid was, as a matter of fact, within their boundaries, but it is still true that the British frontier was violated on the night of the 14th September and that subjects of the Amir were wrongfully harassed by tlm inroad of armed men from Kataba. His Excellency the Governor in Council has no wish to protest to the Turks as regards their methods of administration beyond our frontier and thinks that we must admit that the intention of their proceedings was not to violate the frontier recently demarcated. Still that was the result and the motive of the action taken was obviously arbitrary and unfriendly. It seems to His Excellency desirable that the violation of the frontier in such circumstances should be made the subject of strong protest to prevent future occurrences of a similar nature, and that the present occasion should be utilised to obtain an understanding that persons on either side of the frontier shall be free to settle on the other without hindrance, and most cer tainly without consequences such as ensued in this case. It should also, in the opinion of this Government, be understood most clearly that Turkish local officials cannot themselves enforce their views on the British side of the line, but must proceed by recognised methods of diplomatic representation.

H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to th« Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to your telegram of the 27th ultimo, and in continuation of mine of the 3rd instant, I have the honour to inform you that Major Merewether reports that his enquiries lead him to believe that before making the seizure the Kaim Mukam of Kataha telegraphed to Taiz and received d( finite orders to proceed as he did. He states that he has not been able to ascertain for certain that orders were sent to Taiz from Constantinople on the subject, hut that as the powers of the authorities at Taiz and Kataba are limited in matters concerning the British Government, he is of opinion that they could not have acted without direct instructions from Constantinople. 2. A copy of the protest made by Major Merewether to the Kaim Mukam of Kataba, the reply of the latter thereto, together with a further letter from him to Major Merewether are herewith forwarded. 3 In response to the invitation contained in the Kaim MukanTs letter of the 27th ultimo, Major Merewether accompanied by Lieutenant Yule, who made a survey and sketch of the village, met that officer on the 29th ultimo at a camp in the vicinity of Habil al Khadarr. The Kaim Mukam informed Major Merewether that before arresting the 6 men from Shakhab, the village in Turkish territory, which they had left to go to Mazoob Habil al Khadar he sent an officer to examine the situation and report upon it. The officer reported that Mazoob Habil al Khadar was undoubtedly in Turkish territory. On this report the Kaim Mukam proceeded against the village with Turkish soldiers and Arab fighting men accompanied by several Sheikhs and captured six men and a large number of camels, cattle, etc. 4. Major Merewether states that the marks erected by the Boundary Conw' mission are of,a very defective nature and that the pillars are not even num bered. He describes the position of Mazoob Habil al Khadar as follows :— ^ Mazoob Habil al Khadar (Mazoob means new) is built on a diminutive spur running north-west by west from Babil, al Khadar. This spur is less than 150 yards long. Habil al Khadar is a low eminence running almost west with its east point towards Kataba and its west point towards the north-w 7 est by the point of the Jabal J ihaf range (see Lieutenant Yule’s sketch). There is a boun dary pillar on the end of Habil al Khadar towards Kataba, the next pillar towards Jihaf is clown in the valley and is not visible from any point. There is a third pillar on a slight elevation but hardly visible from Habil al Khadar. On the n&lt; rth &gt;ide of Habil al Khndnr is a well-defined nullah about 300 yards broad which continues beyond the further pillar and is certainly one of the marked features of the ground. On the south-east side is a small and short nullah and the ground there opens out into cultivation. 5. From information obtained by Major Merewether it appears that about a month ago some of the people of Shakhab emigrated and settled on the little si ur of Habil al Khadar and founded there the small village of Mazoob Habil al Khadar. According to Lieutenant Yule’s sketch the boundary line runs 50 yards above the nearest house on the spur on which Mazoob Habil al Khador is built. On the other hand the Amir or Hthala who also accompanied Major Merewether informed him that when Mr. Fitz Maurice showed him the newly demarcated line, be pointed out that the actual line did not follow the line of2 the pillars but the natural boundary, i.e., Habil al K1 adar and the spur on which Mazoob Habil al Khadar stands. He also told him that until this trouble arose the people cultivating the land north-west of Habil al Khadar, i.e., within Turkish limits according to the actual line of the boundary pillars, had paid tribute to him, the Amir ; the Kaim Mukam accident ally confirmed this statement in a conversation with Major Merewether and the cultivators also did so. The Kaim Mukam also stated to Major Mere- wether that a neutral zone of 70 metres, about 80 yards on each side of the boundary line as demarcated by the pillars, had been settled. This being so, the nearest house of Mazoob Habil al Khadar is at least 30 yards inside the neutral zone. Krom a zariba which is nearer to the actual line of boundary than the house above referred to, 2 camels, 3 donkeys and 6 head of cattle were taken by the Turks, two men were also arrested at the place but they were released as they were not the owners. 6. The question therefore in the first place resolves itself into two points :— (1) Whether the Amir’s statement as to Mr. KitzMaurice’s demons tration of the boundary is correct or not, that between the pillars concerned, the boundary line follows the natural boun dary, which it is believed is the usual course. In this case the whole of Mazoob Habil al Khadar would fall within Amiri limits. (2) Whether the Turks have violated the neutral zone. Of this, according to Lieutenant Yule’s sketch, supported as it is by Major Mere wether’s inspection, by the statement of Saleh Naji Ar Kabie and the admission of the Kaim Mukam, there is no doubt. 7. There is another and stronger point—Major Merewether ascertained beyond doubt that the Turks surrounded the village from all sides. The attack took place at 3 a.m. in semi-darkness. Whatever the intentions of the Kaim Mukam may have been there is no doubt whatever from enquiries made by Major Merewether on the spot that the Turkish soldiers and Arabs who comprised his force were quite out of hand and were all over the place. It is f also quite certain that some portion of the Kaim Mukam’s force were in ambush in Amiri territory and that they chased the people who escaped from the village to dwell within Amiri limits, overtook and robbed them,— vide statement (c), Abdulla Ali Sa’dan, who was robbed of § 11, 1 jumbia and a spear, and who w r as captured in Wadi al Abara which is within Amiri limits. This witness is corroborated by Manassar Kassem al Muraisi, statement (d), who states he saw Abdulla Ali Sa’dan being chased in Al Abara. The statement (/) j of Nasir Zaid al Yamaniisalso attached. The statements of the persons actually j captured are not available as they are in jail in Kataba. 8. The whole matter thus resolves itself into the following questions :— (o) In the spur on which Mazoob Habil al Khadar is built within Amiri limits ? {b) Hid the Turks in order to arrest their subjects who were living in Mazoob Habil al Khadar operate within the neutral zone of 70 metres (80 yards) ? (*) Did the Turks and the Arabs who accompanied them cross our ad mitted boundary into Al Abara ? 9. As regards («) the Amir of Dthala states that the spur is within Amiri limits. He is supported by— 1. Mr. KitzMaurice’s alleged demonstration of the boundary to the Amir. 2. The undoubted local belief that it is in Amiri territory.3 3. The fact that until this incident, the cultivators of the crops helow Mnzoob liabil al Khadar and outside the actual line marked by the boundary pillars paid tribute to the Amir and not to the Turks. « 10. With regard to (b) the evidence quoted and of the veracity of which there is no doubt sufficiently proves this. 11. As to (c) this is fully proved. Major Merewether brings to notice the faulty positions of the boundary pillars near Kataba and states that neither he nor Lieutenant Yule were able to find any pillar from which any two others are visible, that is to say that in order to ascertain whether a given point is in Turkish or Amiri limits, it is necessary to make an elaborate sketch and go over the whole ground, as he had to do on this particular occasion. He further states that the present pillars are about four feet high and are completely hidden by the scrub growing round and that they are not numbered. As there is every likelihood of some of the pillars falling down before permanent ones can be erected, he has given orders for them to be repaired. ] 2. In conclusion I would ask that the despatch of maps of the whole boundary and the Blue-book of the work of the Boundary Commission be expedited in order that copies may be sent to Major Merewether as at any time further disputes may arise.

After compliments .—On the evening cf 10th of this month when I visited Kataba to return your official visit, you will remember that you mentioned to me that the Amir of Dthala had induced certain people belonging to the village of Shakhab which is in Turkish territory to leave Shakhab and live in Amiri territory. You did not mention the name of the village in which they were to live. You informed me that you had entertained an idea of going after the people and capturing them with a view to punishment I requested you not to take any such step which, constituting as it would a violation of the Boundary, might interrupt the cordial relations which existed between us. I informed you that if the Amir of Dthala had been guilty of any unjustifiable' or unfriendly act, it would only be necessary for you to inform me of the fact and I would do my utmost to adjust matters satisfactorily. After my return to Dthala, I received information that a force consisting of Turkish officers and soldiers and armed Arabs with several Sheikhs had surrounded the village of Mazoob Habil-al-Khadar which is in the territory of the Amir of Dthala as fixed by the late Boundary Commission, had captured six men belonging to Shakhab together with a large number of camels, cattle, sheep and goats and donkeys and a quantity of property and had removed the men, etc., to Kataba where, I am informed, the men are now kept in jail. I beg again to remind you of my promise to use my influence with the Amir of Dthala in the event cf any unjustifiable or unfriendly act being com mitted by him, and I now enter a strong protest against this violation of the Boundary and ask you to assist me in maintaining the cordial relations which it has been my constant endeavour to preserve and strengthen, by setting these people at liberty and restoring to them their property. I would further bring4 to your notice thut your notion in enusinj* Slieilclis nntl nrmed Arstlis from your territory to cross the boundary and commit acts of violence is likely to create dissensions between tribes in Amiri territory and those within your sphere of influence, a state of affairs which would be much to be deprecated. B From— Fehmi Bey, Kaim Makam of the district of Kataba, To— Major Merevyether, Political Officer, Dthala. After compliments .—We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your kind letter of the 23rd September 1901. We are obliged and thankful to you lor your well-wishing objects and your best endeavour as to the preserva tion of the cordial relations existing between us and for your promise to put a stop to unjustifiable acts by adjusting matters in a satisfactory manner. As regards the people of the village of Shnkhab we have already discussed with you about them before that the Amir was and is always inducing the subjects of Govern ment to go to him and leave their native place on the presumption that the coun tries of those who will coincide with him and become inclinable towards his reflections, will he considered as annexible to the country of Dthala. He also continues to stretch his hands on the property of the subjects inasmuch as suspicion was entertained by many of them, of whom six men of the village of Shakhab were induced, presuming that if they go to him and hamstring (an animal) according to the practice of the Arabs he will absolve them from Amiri rights such as dues and contributions payable for sheep and goats, etc., and reckon their lands, which is situated in Wadi al Hazara as depending on the country of Dthala and that he will protect them. In accordance with his promises to them the subjects have gone to him, hamstrung and made solemn vows with him. Thrse agreements and solemn vows have rendered the subjects guilty of a special crime which resulted in their being dealt with according to law. In consequence of our previous intimation to you at the time when he came to know first of their desertion, we issued orders regarding manning their houses and lands without doing any injury to their lives and live-stock and this was so long as they remained with the Amir and near Bir As Solb which is in Amiri territory. After subsequent news having reached us to the effect that these men came came back over a hill downwards of Habil al Khadar and after enquiry having been instituted by us we arrived at the conclusien that the said place was inside the limits of the district (of Kataba). Such being the case it was necessary for us to go there in company with Yuz Pasha Az-Zandarmah (police), some sepoys and two Sheikhs. On reaching the said spot we arrested the people who were deserters with their animals. After they were arrested and brought up to the Supreme Court enquiries w T ere made as to the reasons that w 7 ere indispens ably necessary for them to leave their native places. It was afterwards ascer tained that their desertion was due to the inducement of the Amir referred to, and as already explained above and as ascertained by those arrested before and after their apprehension. As matters stand we request you in the first instance to do your best endeavours to stop the Amir from such inducements to subjects of Government arid to their properties because his inducements are not only specially to people of Shakhab hot to several others. He prevailed on many per-ons by his persuasions and they were accordingly sought to live in villages in the vicinity of the borders and they are in that similar position, are prepared to all sorts of violations which might interrupt the cordial relations. Enclosed you will find a list shewing the names of the deserters w'hereby you will judge the fact. Secondly we inferred from your kind letter that you have been intimated and complaints were made to you that we violated the boundary for the purpose of arresting the deserters and their live-stock. The fact is that w r e arrested them in the limits of Kataba district. It is a known fact that the peeple of these directions are apt to invent falsehoods so we request you not to credit the re ports of people who are desirous that our relations should be interrupted. The5 ' plans or survey maps showing the boundaries are clear and the boundary pillars are visible and we shall be ready at any time you promise and appoint for your coming or for the coming of any one on your behalf to the place of the inci dents. On arrival God willing we shall jointly institute enquiries so that you will remove the doubt from your favourable mind, 'thirdly ; on our making up our minds to go to the Mazoob where the deserters lived we had in our company two Sheikhs. They were meant to give complete advice and evidence. At the time when we were personally present there was no interference on the part of any one of them. Please do not think otherwise because we noticed in your said letter that this would create dissensions between tribes. Fourthly; we regret our inability from a point of law to accede to your request as to releasing the prisoners and their live-stock because before and after their arrest we were made fully to understand that these people were in league with the Amir and concerted to violate and infringe the prescribed rules. Consequently when their acts were exposed to us we were obliged to remove them with their papers to the Court house. For this reason we apologize we cannot release them from a point of law before decision having been passed. However for the purpose of manifesting the cordial relations to your honour, |\ on the receipt of your kind letter, all their live-stock were released after the : \ payment of the methodical taxes. God willing later on we shall communicate to you the result of the decision also. May you he preserved. Salutation. Dated 15th Rajah 1322 — 25th September 1904, c. From— Fehmi Bey, Kaim Makam of the District of Kataba, To— Major Merewbther, Political Officer, Dthala. After compliments .—The reply to your letter of the 23rd September 1904 has been already sent to you and we have also written and referred the matter by telegraph to the Governor-General of Yeman Saheb Ad Dawla Tawfiq Bek Afandem Hadthratlarch about the Amir’s inducements in such matters and others about your good wishes by causing the affairs to resume a satisfactory conclusion in the borders generally. A reply has been received from the direc tion that if the scruple is not yet removed from your minds as mentioned in your first letter to the effect that you have been informed that we violated the boundary for the purpose of arresting the people of Shakhab and their animals it will be necessary for us to meet together and go to the place of the incident for verification and adjustment of matters jointly. We write you this letter and expect you to fix a time for our meeting as already suggested to you in our former letter for the purpose of removing your scruple, doing away with dubious ness and expelling doubtfulness. Your reply is urgently necessary. May you be preserved. Dated 17th Rajah 1322 — 27th September 1904. B. Saleh Naji ar Rabiee states:— I was originally an inhabitant of the village of Shakhab. One month ago I left Shakhab and came with others for protection in the British territory. The isolated house on this side of the village belongs to me. On the day on which the Turks came on the spot I was not in my house but there were two persons who were as my servants, one as a shepherd and the other a tiller. If I was in the house they could have arrested me. Two camels, 3 donkeys and 6 head of cattle were in an enclosure just in front of the house belonging toi ; 6 me on this side. These animals were taken away from the enclosure. I did not see from where the Turks came to the village but only saw them where they were on the roofs of the houses. I could only see some Arab soldiers coming from the place where the camels of the troops and the Kaim Makam’s horses were standing. This place was within the boundary line and they were inside Amiri territory. Mark of Saleh Naji ar Rabiee. Before me, (Sd.) W. MEREWETHER, Major, The 30th September 1904.

On Wednes day (14th September 1904) in the early morning the Turks came to Habil-al- Khadar and carried away the live-stock of all the inhabitants of the village and arrested five men whom they carried away to Kataba as prisoners. I managed to escape from the village but was chased by about 12 Arab soldiers who were in ambush in the^ slopes of the Habil-al-Khadar. They overtook me in Wadi-al-Abara. $11, 1 jambia and 1 spear was taken off me and I was taken back by them to the village whence I fled away again and came to this place. The Turkish and Arab soldiers surrounded the village from both oppo site and rear sides. Mark of Abdulla Ali Sa’dan. Before me, (Sd.) W. MEREWETHER, Major, The 30th September 1904.

I built my house in Habil al Khadar in order to become protected in British territory. On Wednesday (14th September 1904) the Kaim Makam and IJz Pasha with some Arab and Turkish soldiers surrounded the village from the Wadi in the rear of the village and from the hill opposite it. I saw them actually on the hill named Habil al Khadar which is within the boundary line. I was robbed of the undermentioned animals and things : — 2 Cows. 1 She-camel. 2 Leather ropes. 1 Charara. The two cows and the she-camel were restored to me. I saw some Arab soldiers chasing Abdulla Ali Sa’dan in places where rain \ water falls to Al Abara. These places are well within Amiri territory and within this side of the boundary line. I was also chased by some soldiers who ran after me as far as a hill inAmiri territory, but as they could not overtake me they returned. Mark of Manassar Kasem al Muraisi. Before me, (Sd.) W. MEREWETHER, Major, The 30th September 1904. Political Officer, Pthala.7 E. Saleh Ahmed Mehdi states :— I was in the village of Shakhab. I came to live with others in British limits. I came to this place because I know that it was in British limits and heard the Kaina Makam himself saying so and also others that it was in British limits. The Kaim Makain before arresting the men and carrving away our animals came to the village and asked me as to who permitted us and the other people to build houses here. I replied that we came of our own accord. Also Sayad Ilusain, nephew of Sayad Abdul Kader and TJz Pasha came to the village one day before the Kaim Makam and said to me as well as to others that we should go back to Shakhab and should not remain in British limits as this action of ours was to complicate them with the British. Next morning our village was surrounded and our animals were carried away. I did not see the soldiers when surrounding the village. Naser Zaid al Yamani states :— I am one of the deserters of Shakhab. After I deserted I built a house territory. On Tuesday night (13th September 1901) I was in the Wadi guarding my lands. Next morning at about 4-30 a.m. the soldiers of the Turks surrounded my house and carried away 4 bullocks and 2 donkeys belong ing to me. On my return from the Wadi I found only my wife and my two children. Also my house furnitures were carried away. 1 did not see the soldiers surrounding my house. I do not know whether they were Turks or Arabs. No men were captured in my house except my animals. I built my house here after I was informed that the place was in British limits, and actually it was so. Mark of Saleh Ahmed Mahdi. Before me, The 30th September 1904. (Sd.) W.

Please return at your convenience the volume of Proceedings.[.This Documen t is the Property of Hi&amp; Britannic Majesty’s Government.] I REMINDED the Grand V izier yesterday that since he had asked me not to press for the punishment of the Kaimakam of Kataba in connection with the infringe ment of Amiri territory, as reported to your Lordship in my despatch No '789 of the 11th ultimo, I had heard no more from his Highness on the subject. I was now in possession of a full report of what had occurred, as shown in the inclosures which accompanied your Lordship’s despatch No. 400 of the 22nd instant. From a perusal of the documents which had been communicated to me I had learned that the Kaimakam was still more seriously to blame than had appeared at first, since he had wilfully invaded Amiri territory after he had been requested by the British Resident not to take such action, but to submit any complaint which he might have against Turkish subjects who he asserted had crossed into the Amiri country to him. In spite of this, the Kaimakam had committed the outrage, and 1 should be glad to learn what report of the affair had been received by the Sublime Porte, and what steps had been taken to punish the guilty official. The Grand Vizier replied that he had not yet received any detailed report, but that he believed that the Mutessarif of Taiz, who had been sent to investigate the affair, had destituted the Kaimakam, and that that functionary was now awaiting his trial. .

From—C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—L* W. Dane, Esq., C.S I., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 254-P., dated the 2nd October 1904, and of subsequent telegraphic correspondence, I am now directed to transmit, for the information of the Governor-General in Council, copy of the full report of General Mason of the incident of the 14th September, which involved the violation of the recently demarcated boundary of the Amiri territory. 2. T le history of events seems briefly to he as follows :—On the 10th September Major Merewether specially requested the K.aim Mukamof Kataba, with a view to avoiding any violation of the boundary or any interruption of the cordial relations existing between the Turkish and the British authorities, to refrain from taking any action in regard to certain Turkish suojects who were said to have deserted Shakhab and placed themselves under the Amir of Dthala (It is of importance to note, with reference to the doubt as to the precise position of the hamlet to which they resorted, that these deserters, at any rate, thought they were proceeding to a place on the British side of the boundary line.) The ELaim Mukam appears to have taken the steps to satisfyA y * himself that he could with some show of reason claim that the particular house in which the Turkish subjects were to be found was on the Turkish side of the boundary line and to have then, on the 14th September, proceeded to invest and attack the village. There is no question but that in the process of attack ing it not only did his troops violate the frontier but they actually penetrated a considerable distance across the boundary into the British sphere of influence and captured and robbed at least one individual. 3. General Mason’s present report seems to show that the precise locality ^ in question is on the Turkish side of a straight line drawn between the two boundary pillars; but he claims that not only is it within the neutral zone agreed upon by the Boundary Commissioners but that, in accordance with the arrangement said to have been made at the time, it is within the actual intend ed boundary line. I am to enclose copy of a telegram which was addressed to the Resident at Aden enquiring whether Mr. FitzMaurice has been referred to as to the truth of the statements made in this matter and of his reply. It will be seen, from a comparison of the map now received, and of the Commis- sion’s map sent with their No. 18,* dated the 15th March last, that the pillar num bered 2 in the enclosed sketch map is pillar XXXII of the Commission’s num bering, and that, therefore, Mazub Habil al Khadar is, in part at any rate, in the nuetral zone on the Turkish side of the line. 4. Admitting this, however, there seems to the Governor in Council to be no doubt whatever that the British side of the frontier was violated on the night of the 14th September last, and that, not only were Turkish subjects kidnapped from within either the neutral zone or the British side of the fron tier as the case may prove to be, but subjects of the Amir of Dthala were wan tonly harassed by tbe inroad of armed men from Kataba. The Governor in Council, accordingly, feels that there is no occasion to modify in any respect the demands already pressed by the Government of India as to re paration for the outrage. The admitted facts show unauthorised aggression involving the gravest risk of arousing reprisals, and perpetrated in spite of freindly but earnest representations on the part of the British Political Officer at Dthala. All that appears from the full report now to hand is that there was room for doubt in regard to one particular detail of the matters in issue; but the arbitrary and unfriendly action of the Kaim Mukam should not be acquiesced in, nor, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, should the British Govern ment consent further to discuss the Kaim Mukam’s contention until, as a pre liminary, the kidnapped Turkish subjects are handed over to the Political Officer at Dthala. Insistence upon this will, the Governor in Council believes, not only have a good political effect upon the tribes, but will establish, once for all, the diplomatic procedure which should be followed in all such cases arising in future. 5. The Resident’s remarks as to the condition of the boundary pillars and as to the difficulty of determining the precise line of demarcation point to the - necessity of early construction, at all events in the neighbourhood of Kataba, of permanent and more easily distinguishable marks, and this is a matter upon which General Mason’s proposals will be invited. 6. I am to request that the maps now sent may be returned to this Gov ernment ; copies will, when reproduced at the Photozinco Office, be despatched to you.

Prtif, Simla,-No, 810 F. D.-M1-04-00.-3J 3/■ / Confidential] No. 185 ; dated Aden Residency, the 8th October 1904*. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden, k ^ ,0 hl^ To—C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to your telegram of the 27th ultimo, and in continuation of mine of the 3rd instant, I have the honour to inform you that Major definite orders to proceed as he did. He states that he has not been able to ascertain for certain that orders were sent to Taiz from Constantinople on the subject, but that as the powers of the authorities at Taiz and Kataba are limited in matters concerning the British Government, he is of opinion that they could not have acted without direct instructions from Constantinople. 2. A copy of the protest made by Major Merewether to the Kaim Mukam of Kataba, the reply of the latter thereto, together with a further letter from him to Major Merewether are herewith forwarded. 3. In response to the invitation contained in the Kaim Mukam’s letter of the 27th ultimo, Major Merewether accompanied by Lieutenant Yule, who made a survey and sketch of the village, met that officer on the 29th ultimo at a camp in the vicinity of Habil al Khadar. The Kaim Mukam informed Major Merewether that before arresting the 6 men from Shakhab, the village in Turkish territory, which they had left to go to Mazoob Habil al Khadar he sent an officer to examine the situation and report upon it. The officer reported that Mazoob Hahil al Khadar was undoubtedly in Turkish territory. On this report the Kaim Mukam proceeded against the village with Turkish soldiers and Arab fighting men accompanied by several Sheikhs and captured six men and a large number of camels, cattle, etc. 4. Major Merewether states that the marks erected by the Boundary Com-' mission are of a very detective nature and that the pillars aie not even num bered. He describes the position of Mazoob Habil al Khadar as follows :— Mazooh Hahil al Khadar (Mazoob means new) is built on a diminutive spur xunning north west by west from Habil al Khadar.^ This spur is less than 150 tards long. Habil al Khadar is a low eminence running almost west with its east point towards Kataba audits west point towards the north-west by the point of the Jabal Jihaf range (see Lieutenant Yule’s sketch). There is a boun dary pillar on the end of Habil al Khadar towards Kataba, the next pillar towards Jihaf is down in the valley and is not visible from any point. There is a third pillar on a slight elevation but hardly visible from Habil al Khadar. On the m rth side of Habil al Khadar is a well-defined nullah about 300 yards broad which continues beyond the further pillar and is certainly one of the marked features of the ground. On the south-east side is a small and short nullah and the ground there opens out into cultivation. \/A. AX*. ^7 ^ ^ ^ J Merewether reports that his enquiries lead him to believe that before making the seizure the Kaim Mukam of Kataba telegraphed to Taiz and received2 the pillars but the natural boundary, i.e., Habil al Kladar and the spur on - which Mazoob Habil al Khadar stands. He also told him that until this trouble arose the people cultivating the land north-west of Habil al Khadar, i.e., within Turkish limits according to the actual line of the boundary pillars, had paid tribute to him, the Amir; the Kaim Mukam accident ally confirmed this statement in a conversation with Major Mere wether and the cultivators also did so. The Kaim Mukam also stated to Major Mere- wether that a neutral zone of 70 metres, about 80 yards on each side of the boundary line as demarcated by the pillars, had been settled. This being so, the nearest house of Mazoob Habil al Khadar is at least 30 yards inside the neutral zone. From a zariba which is nearer to the actual line of boundary than the house above referred to, 2 camels, 3 donkeys and 6 head of cattle were taken by the Turks, two men were also arrested at the place but they were released as they were not the owners. 6. The question therefore in the first place resolves itself into two points :— (1) Whether the Amir’s statement as to Mr. FitzMaurice’s demons tration of the boundary is correct or not, i,e. % that between the pillars concerned, the boundary line follows the natural boun dary, which it is believed is the usual course. In this case the whole of Mazoob Habil al Khadar would fall within Amiri limits. (2) Whether the Turks have violated the neutral zone. Of this, according to Lieutenant Yule’s sketch, supported as it is by Major Mere wether’s inspection, by the statement of Saleh Naji Ar Rabie and the admission of the Kaim Mukam, there is no doubt. 7. There is another and stronger point—Major Merewether ascertained beyond doubt that the Turks surrounded the village from all sides. The attack took place at 3 a.m. in semi-darkness. Whatever the intentions of the Kaim Mukam may have been there is no doubt whatever from enquiries made by Major Merewether on the spot that the Turkish soldiers and Arabs who comprised his force were quite out of hand and were all over the place. It is also quite certain that some portion of the Kaim Mukam’s force were in ambush in Amiri territory and that they chased the people who escaped from the village to dwell within Amiri limits, overtook and robbed them,— vide statement (c), Abdulla Ali Sa’dan, who was robbed of § 11, 1 jumbia and a spear, and who was captured in Wadi al Abara which is within Amiri limits. This witness is corroborated by Manassar Kassem al Muraisi, statement (d), w ho states he saw Abdulla Ali Sa’dan being chased in Al Abara. The statement (/) of Nasir Zaid al Yamaniis also attached. The statements of the persons actually captured are not available as they are in jail in Kataba. 8. The whole matter thus resolves itself into the following questions :— (a) In the spur on which Mazoob Habil al Khadar is built within Amiri ^ limits ? (b) Did the Turks in order to arrest their subjects who were living in Mazoob Habil al Khadar operate within the neutral zone of 70 metres (80 yards) ? (c) Did the Turks and the Arabs who accompanied them cross our ad mitted boundary into Al Abara ? 9. As regards («) the Amir of Dthala states that the spur is within Amiri limits. He is supported by— 1. Mr. FitzMaurice’s alleged demonstration of the boundary to the Amir. 2. The undoubted local belief that it is in Amiri territory.3. The fact that until this incident, the cultivators of the crops below Mazoob Habil al Khadar and outside the actual line marked by the boundary pillars paid tribute to the Amir and not to the Turks. 10. With regard to (5) the evidence quoted and of the veracity of which there is no doubt sufficiently proves this. 11. As to (c) this is fully proved. Major Merewether brings to notice the faulty positions of the boundary t pillars near Kataba and states that neither he nor Lieutenant Yule were able to find any pillar from which any two others are visible, that is to say that in \ order to ascertain .whether a given point is in Turkish or Amiri limits, it is \ necessary to make an elaborate sketch and go over the whole ground, as he had to do on this particular occasion. He further states that the present pillars are about four feet high and are completely hidden by the scrub growing round and that they are not numbered. As there is every likelihood of some of the / pillars falling down before permanent ones can be erected, he has given orders for them to be repaired. 3 2. In conclusion I would ask that the despatch of maps of the whole boundary and the Blue-book of the work of the Boundary Commission be expedited in order that copies may be sent to Major Merewether as at any time further disputes may arise; No 186, dated Aden, 9th October 1904.

Merewbthpr, Political Officer, Dthala, To—His Presence Fehmi Bey, Kaim Makam, Kataba. After compliments .—On the evening of 10th of this month when I visited Kataba to return your official visit, you will remember that you mentioned to me that the Amir of Dthala had induced certain people belonging to the village of Shakhab which is in Turkish territory to leave Shakhab and live in Amiri territory. You did not mention the name of the village in which they were to live. You informed me that you had entertained an idea of going after the people and capturing them with a view to punishment. I requested you not to take any such step which, constituting as it w r ould a violation of the Boundary, might interrupt the cordial relations which existed between us. I informed you that if the Amir of Dthala had been guilty of any unjustifiable or unfriendly act, it would only be necessary for you to inform me of the fact and I would do my utmost to adjust matters satisfactorily. After my return to Dthala, I received information that a force consisting of Turkish officers and soldiers and armed Arabs with several Sheikhs had surrounded the village of Mazoob Habil-aLKhadar which is in the territory of the Amir of Dthala as fixed by the late Boundary Commission, had captured six men belonging to Shakhab together with a large number of camels, cattle, sheep and goats and donkeys and a quantity of property and had removed the men, etc., to Kataba where, I am informed, the men are now kept in jail. I beg again to remind you of my promise to use my influence with the Amir of Dthala in the event of any unjustifiable or unfriendly act being com mitted by him, and I now enter a strong protest against this violation of the Boundary and ask you to assist me in maintaining the cordial relations which it has been my constant endeavour to preserve and strengthen, by setting these people at liberty and restoring to them their property. I would further bring4 to your notice that yonr action in causing Sheikhs and armed Arabs from your territory to cross the boundary and commit acts of violence is likely to create dissensions between tribes in Amiri territory and those within your sphere of influence, a state of affairs which would be much to be deprecated. B. From— Fehmi Bet, Kaim Makam of the district of Kataba, To— Major Mereyvether, Political Officer, Dtbala. After compliments .—We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt erf your kind letter of the 23rd September 190 k We are obliged and thankful to you for your well-wishing objects and your best endeavour as to the preserva tion of the cordial relations existing between us and for your promise to put a stop to unjustifiable acts by adjustinc; matters in a satisfactory manner. As regards the people of the village of Shakhab we have already discussed with you about them before that the Amir was and is always inducing the subjects of Govern ment to go to him and leave their native place on the presumption that the coun tries of those who will coincide with him and become inclinable towards his reflections, will he considered as annexible to the country of Dthala. He also continues to stretch his hands on the property of the subjects inasmuch as suspicion was entertained by many of them, of whom six men of the village of Shakhab were induced, presuming that if they go to him and hamstring (an animal) according to the practice of the Arabs be will absolve them from Amiri rights such as dues and contributions payable for sheep and goats, etc., and reckon their lands, which is situated in Wadi al Hazara as depending on the country of Dthala and that he will protect them. In accordance with his promises to them the subjects have gone to him, hamstrung and made solemn vows -with him. These agreements and solemn vows have rendered the subjects guilty of a special crime which resulted in their being dealt with according to law. In consequence of our previous intimation to you at the time when he came to know first of their desertion, we issued orders regarding manning their houses and lands without doing any injury to their lives and live-stock and this was so long as they remained with the Amir and near Bir As Solb which is in Amiri territory. After subsequent news having reached us to the effect that these men came came back over a hill downwards of Hahil al Khadar and after enquiry having been instituted by us we arrived at the conclusion that the said place was inside the limits of the district (of Kataba). Such being the case it was necessary for us to go there in company with Yuz Pasha Az-Zandarmah (police), some sepoys and two Sheikhs. On reaching the said spot we arrested the people who were deserters with their animals. After they were arrested and brought up to the Supreme Court enquiries w r ere made as to the reasons that were indispens ably necessary for them to leave their native places. It was afterwards ascer tained that their desertion was due to the inducement of the Amir referred to, and as already explained above and as ascertained by those arrested before and after their apprehension. As matters stand we request you in the first instance to do your best endeavours to stop the Amir from such inducements to subjects of Government and to their properties because his inducements are not only specially to people of Shakhab but to several others. He prevailed on many persons by his persuasions and they were accordingly sought to live in villages in the vicinity of the borders and they are in that similar position, are prepared to all sorts of violations which might interrupt the cordial relations. Enclosed you will find a list shewing the names of the deserters whereby you will judge the fact. Secondly we inferred from your kind letter that you have been intimated and complaints were made to you that we violated the boundary for the purpose of arresting the deserters and their live-stock. The fact is that we arrested them in the limits of Kataba district. It is a known fact that the peeple of these directions are apt to invent falsehoods so we request you not to credit the re ports of people who are desirous that our relations should be interrupted. The- plans or survey maps showing the boundaries are clear and the boundary pillars are visible and we shall be ready at any time you promise and appoint for your coming or for the coming of any one on your behalf to the place of the inci dents. On arrival God willing we shall jointly institute enquiries so that you will remove the doubt from your favourable mind, 'thirdly ; on our making up our minds to go to the Mazoob where the deserters lived we had in our company two Sheikhs. They were meant to give complete advice and evidence. At the time when we were personally present there was no interference on the part of any one of them. Please do not think otherwise because we noticed in your said letter that this would create dissensions between tribes. Fourthly; we regret our inability from a j&gt;oint of law to accede to your request as to releasing the prisoners and their live-stock because before and after their arrest we were made fully to understand that these people were in league with the Amir and concerted to violate and infringe the prescribed rules. Consequently when their acts were exposed to us we were obliged to remove them with their papers to the Court house. For this reason we apologize we cannot release them from a point of law before decision having been passed. However for the purpose of manifesting the cordial relations to your honour, on the receipt of your kind letter, all their live-stock were released after the payment of the methodical taxes. God willing later on we shall communicate to you the result of the decision also. May you be preserved. Salutation.

After compliments .—The reply to your letter of the 23rd September 1901i has been already sent to you and we have also written and referred the matter bv telegraph to the Governor-General of Yeman Saheb Ad Dawla Taw r fiq Bek Afandem Hadthratlarch about the Amir’s inducements in such matters and others about your good wishes by causing the affairs to resume a satisfactory conclusion in the borders generally. A reply has been received from the direc tion that if the scruple is not yet removed from your minds as mentioned in your first letter to the effect that you have been informed that we violated the boundary for the purpose of arresting the people of Shakhab and their animals it will be necessary for us to meet together and go to the place of the incident for verification and adjustment of matters jointly. We write you this letter and expect you to fix a time for our meeting as already suggested to you in our former letter for the purpose of removing your scruple, doing away with dubious ness and expelling doubtfulness. Your reply is urgently necessary. May you be preserved. Dated 17th Bajab 1322—27th September 1904. B. Saleh Naji ar Babiee states:— I was originally an inhabitant of the village of Shakhah. month ago I left Shakhab and came with others for protection in the British territory. The isolated house on this side of the village belongs to me. On the day on which the Turks came on the spot I was not in my house but there were two persons who were as my servants, one as a shepherd and the other a tiller. If I was in the house they could have arrested me. Two camels, 3 donkeys and 6 head of cattle were in an enclosure just in front of the house belonging to6 &gt; me on this side. These animals were taken away from the enclosure. I did not see from where the lurks came to the village but only saw them where ^ they were on the roofs of the houses. I could only see some Arab soldiers coming from the place where the camels of the troops and the Kaim Makara’s horses were standing. This place was within the boundary line and they were mside Amiri territory. J Khadar and carried away the live-stock of all the inhabitants of the village and arrested five men whom they carried away to Kataba as prisoners. I managed to escape from the village but was chased bv about 12 Arab soldiers who were m ambush in the slopes of the Habil-al.Khadar. TW D. Manassar Kassem al Muraisi states I was one month before this date in the village of Shakhab. I built my house m Habil al Khadar in order to become protected in British territory. On Wednesday (14th September 1904) the Kaim Makam and Uz Pasha with some Arab and Turkish soldiers surrounded the village from the Wadi in the rear of the village and from the hill opposite it. I saw them actually on the lull named Habil al Khadar which is within the boundary line. 1 was robbed ot the undermentioned animals and things The two cows and the she-camel were restored to me. I saw some Arab soldiers chasing Abdulla Ali Sa*dan in places where rain water falls to Al Abara. These places are well within Amiri territory and within this side of the boundary line. I was also chased by some soldiers who ran after me as far as a hill inAmiri territory, but as they could not overtake me they returned. Mark of Saleh Naji ar Rabiee.

I came to this place because I know that it was in British limits and heard the Kaim Makam himself saying so and also others that it was in British limits. The Kaim Makam before arresting the men and carrying away our animals came to the village and asked me as to who permitted us and the other people to build houses here. I replied that we came of our own accord. Also Sayad Husain, nephew of Sayad Abdul Kader and Uz Pasha came to the village one day before the Kaim Makam and said to me as well as to others that we should go back to Shakhab and should not remain in British limits as this action of ours was to complicate them with the British. Next morning our village was surrounded and our animals were carried away. I did not see the soldiers when surrounding the village. Mark of Saleh Ahmed Mahdi. Before me, (Sd.) W.

I am to observe that the detailed facts of the incident as now related emphasise the suggestion already made by this Government and which is supported by General Mason that a strong representation should be addressed to the Porte regarding the violation of the demarcated boundary under the leadership of the Kaimmakam of Kataba, whose removal from office should, His Excellency in Council considers, be insisted upon.

Hill, E sq., C.I.F., Aetnig Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In continuation of my telegram of the 21st instant, I have the honour to inform you that Major Merewether, in a letter dated the 17th instant from Dthala reports that on the 10th idem he went to Kataba to return the visit of the Kaimmakam of that place and was cordially received by him. The Kaimma- ram returned his visit, and in the course of conversation he casually mentioned that the Amir of Dthala had enticed away a number of inhabitants of the vil lage of Sbakhab, which is in Turkish territory, and had induced them to settle inMazoob Hahil Al Khadar in Amiri limits : he said he was so annoyed about this that he thought of going after these people and capturing them and their property, and added that he had already attached their lands in Shakhab. Major Merewether requested the Kaimmakam not to take any such steps, and as sured him that if the Amir of Dthala had been guilty of any unjustifiable or unfriendly act, it would only he necessary for him to represent the circumstance to the British authorities to ensure their doing everything possible to adjust matters. The Kaimmakam thanked Major Merewether, and the subject w'as dropped. However, on the evening of the 14th instant, after his return to Dth ala, Major Merewether received the information that at 3 a.m. that morning Hizam Abdula As S iyadi, Sheikh of the Al ’Od country, in Turkish territory, with 50 Arab fighting men and Yuz Pasha with 50 Turkish soldiers, sur rounded Mazoob Hahil Al Khadar, captured G men, (Turkish subjects) who had left Shakhab and taken up their residence in the former village, and carried off camels, cattle, sheep and goats, etc., belonging to the above 6 men. None of the Amir’s subjects appear to hive been molested. The Kaimmakam of Kataba was actually present himself at the time, he having, it is reported, befere surrounding the village, telegraphed to Taiz and received orders to go and capture the fugitives, punish them, and carry off their goods and animals. Major Mrewether also received a letter from Sheikh Nasir bin Shaif Saif, son of the Amir, complaining of this action of the Kaimmakam, the Amir himself being in the Halmin country at the time. 2. As regards the Kaimmakam’s statement to Major Merewether that the Amir had himself enticed away the people of Shakhah from Turkish into Amiri territory, that officer states, from enquiries made by him, he has come to the conclusion that what really happened was that these people, like many of the Turkish subj&amp;ts, were extremely dissatisfied at the treatment they were receiving and they themselves approached the Amir with the request that thev miHit be allowed to live in Ins territory. The Amir acceded to this re quest the more readily because lately he lias bought lands for himself both in Turkish and Amiri limits, just on one side of the boundary. His intention inallowing these people to settle in Mazoob Eabil A1 Khadar was that they should cultivate some of these lands for him. It is possible that the Amir su&lt;-. gestod to the Shakhab people that they should go ana live in the village above mentioned, but the information received does not point to this. J V® JOr Merewether further states there is a rumour current in Dthala that the Kaimmakam has been told he is to be removed from bis office and at he lias violated our boundary in this manner in order to create ilL-fellin*' between the British and Turkish Governments to spite his own Government’ ibis however Major Merewether considers to be hardly probable. 4. Since he has been in Dthala Major Merewether has made every en- deavour o improve our relations with the Turks, especially as regards disputes between 1 urkish and Amir, subjects. His efforts met with considerable success, and he received a letter from the Mutaserrif of Taiz thanking him for what he )ad done and assuring him of his cordial co-operation. The action of the Kaim- W n K ba p ,aS a ^ ve fP° rte( it was therefore quite inexcusable, especially s e had been informed by Major Merewether on the 10th instant that he had only to represent the matter he complained of officially, and it would he inquired into and adjusted. _ 5 * Such action on the part of the Kaimmakam is not calculated to pre- hTc? 6 C ° rdial rel f tl0 i us ^ween the British and Turkish Governments which n,,r tn )een endeaV0Ur to mainta iu.

IN obedience to the instructions contained in your Lordship’s telegram No. 138 of the 23rd September, I have caused an energetic protest to be made to the Minister for Foreign Affairs against the violation of the Amiri territory, reported in the Aden Resident’s telegram of the 23rd September. I have asked that an immediate inquiry should be made into the facts, and I have given the Porte to understand that if, on the receipt of further particulars, it is clear that the Kaimakam of Kataba had, in spite of the protests of our officials, violated the frontier, he would have to be dismissed. I begged that instructions should be sent to the local authorities to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, and to address themselves, should the occasion arise, to the Amir of Dthali himself or to the British officer stationed in his territory. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR [2182 k~~l]Dated Received at London OfficeFrom Viceroy t 13/A October 1904. p —Aden boundary. Turkish violation of Amiri /ro«/&lt;&gt;r. Fow telearam of \st October. The fact that some villagers of Shakhab had quitted Turkish territory and settled on Amiri side of the border, appears to have been the only reason for action of Turks. At 3 a.m. on thelUh September the Kaim Makam of Kataba and Yuzpasba surrounded Habib-al-Khadar with a force of 50 Turkish soldiers. Six Shakhab men were crested and carried off, together with all their property. Merewether had told the Kaim- Makam, on the \Oth September, that direct action against these men should not be taken by him; but that if he addressedhim he ™ouldbe examine any allegation against the action of the Amir of Dthah, but it was his belief that villagers left Shakhab of their own accord. , . The recommendation of the Bombay Government is that the removal oj the Kaim-Makam should be demanded. It is reported that the Turkish Govern ment had already issued orders for his removal. In our opmwnfull explana tions should be required, and urgent representations should be made against such open violation of borders recently demarcated. ^ Gh ^ w ^ ^' m)From Resident, Aden, to Government of Bombay, Political Department, 3rd October 1904. (Repeated to Secretary of State, Constantinople, Foreign Secretary, Governynent of India, and Mr. FitzMaurice.) P.— Your telegram of the 21th September. I have just received, and am forwarding to you, the report from Political Officer, Dthali, who states that Kaim-makam's action was taken under orders from Taiz. Some doubt apparently exists as to whether a portion of Mazorb-al-Khadar is situated in Amiri territory, but there is no doubt, Merewether reports, that Turks did violate Amiri boundary when they seized the six men. Kaim-makam, in reply to protest made by Merewether, denies that any violation of Amiri territory took place. Both Merewether and FitzMaurice advocate strong representations to Porte. I concur in their view. , j (3mFrom Secretary of State to Viceroy % Foreign Department t 1st October 1904. P- —With reference to your telegram of the 2Qth ultimo regarding the violation of Amiri frontier by Turks, instructions have been sent to Ambassador at Constantinople to the effect that he is to request Forte to communicate by telegraph to Turkish local authorities such orders as will ensure that they will refrain from taking any action beyond the frontier themselves in all cases of this kind, and will canfine themselves to addressing representation to Amir of Dthali, or, in case of necessity, to the British officer stationed at that vlace.Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is any mistake in this telegram, to communicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State. /T.

GW ^ Tfe 8fw 'ff 0From Viceroy, 26th September 1904. p.— We have received a report from Resident at Aden to the effect that Habit-al-Kuba, village in neighbourhood of Kataba, situated three miles within the demarcated boundary, was surrounded on the 14/A September by an armed force, in spite of fact that Political Officer at Dthala had previously objected, and six Turkish subjects residing in village were seized and removed. Resident has been requested to furnish report of circumstances, and in mean time, if he has not already done so, to make protest officially, through Political Officer at Dthala to Turkish local authorities. Incident may be of assistance to Sir N. O'Conor in securing from Porte full settlement of boundary question. Government of Bombay suggest that it should be made subject of a strong representation to Porte.mjuleiit in/. ■ i^/0v&gt;.L,r iv/us ■ ^TDrn/:^ &lt; / 7/^ Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Undersecretary of State for 'India, and is directed by the Secretary of State to transmit, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copies of offsetegram, as marked in the margin, relating to Mml (Xmaa.
