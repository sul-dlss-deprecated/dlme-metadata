My wish was to avoid friction between the military and the Persians such as arose in Iraq during last war but since General Staff do not mind Consular criticisms of the policy of General [grp.undec.] being^distributed to various addresses I am making no change in distribution of Consular reports. I am modifying instructions to Ahwaz and Kermanshah referred to in my telegram No.1159- to the extent that reports for general circulation may include 'constructive criticisms on effect of military measures' provided language is circumspect and violent ^ opposition is confined' to'reports addressed to His Majesty s Legation alone. lkf\sCf.

He cites as an example Ahwaz &gt; telegram Ho. 6 of 25th October and suggests tnat weekly situation reports should only be sent to His majesty s Legation. Suggestion has much to recommend it and I suggest that as an experiment situation reports from all posts should be sent only to Legation where essentia]^ portions of them would' be embodied in one telegram which would be sent.to Foreign Office, Cairo and Indiaand also to all consuls in Persia to keep them acquainted % with the situation in general. Consular posts staffed fyom India would continue to repeat to India if the Government of India so desired.*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000224_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/669</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000224</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/669</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 7371/41 ‘Distribution of Persian Consular reports’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1941/1941</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-07T09:08:47</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (7 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 9; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains a small number of telegrams sent between Sir Reader William Bullard, HM Minister at Tehran; the Foreign Office; and the External Affairs Department of the Government of India.
