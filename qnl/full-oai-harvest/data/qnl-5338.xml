An additional foliation sequence is also present in parallel between ff 2-40; these numbers are written in a combination of blue ink and pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence between British officials regarding the possibility of establishing a telegraphic office in Doha as per the stipulations of the 1916 treaty signed between Britain and Qatar. Contrary to what the title of the file implies, Dubai is only mentioned in passing and Doha is very much the focus of the correspondence.The file contains a draft of an agreement between Cable and Wireless Limited and the ruler of Qatar, Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani for the establishment of a telegraphic office in Doha that was proposed in 1950 (folios 37-40).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002e2#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002e2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
