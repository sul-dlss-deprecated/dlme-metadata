A3 desired, our representatives will be expressly warned not to lay claim to aiy official status in their dealings with the local Persians. With regard to the allowances to be paid, we are agreeable to the work being perlomied for the reduced remuneration of Rupees 75 per month, and assume that in accordance with the Department's letter of 15th.September 1931 they will acrme as from 1st .March 1931.

With reference to your endorsement No.2448 dated the 22nd November 1932 forwarding copy of an Express letter No.P. 145-N/31 dated the 2nd November 19 32, from Foreign Delhi to Brit consul Busnire, I have the honour to report as follows. Reference para 2(i) of the above quoted letter. From my former experience as Assistant Political Agent, Mefcran I strongly endorse the views expressed in the Hobble the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan^ No. 1947 dated the 19th May 1923. Since the above letter was written in 1923 the status of the Telegraph has undergone considerable change and the personnel has been reduced. Apart from the above I consider it essential that the appointment of the British Agent at Gwadur should be an entirely separate entity. The situation at Gwadur is one that needs exceedingly careful watching and tactful nandling, particularly in view of the strong factional feeling that prevails there. Without wishing in any way to cast aspersions, for obvious reasons I consider it would be highly undesirable for a Telegraph clerk to combine his normal duties with those oi the British Agent and I strongly deprecate any such proposal. As regards para 2(ii) of the same letten- I am of the opinion that the services of awithout loss of efficiency^ that any such proposal would he uneconomical* In the temporary absence of the British Agent, whether on duty, leave or sickness, it devolves on the Koharrir to carry on the former’s functions. Should the appointment be done away with, a relief for the British Agent would have to be found on each occasion from else where. Such practice would be both costly and un satisfactory. Apart from the foregoing there is a sufficiency of work to Justify the retention of the ^oharrir in all normal times. As regards the proposal to dispense with the services of the peon attached to the British Agent*- I am adverse to this proposal. The British Agent is the sole representative of British interests and British prestige in Gwadur and, though the latter consideration may not count for much in present times, the Agent has none the less to maintain a certain position. To reduce his very small staff would un doubtedly lower his status in local eyes, a result which I regard as hignly detrimental at the present juncture. Whilst fully realising the necessity for econony and retrenchment I regret therefore being unable to agree with the proposals now suggested by the Govern ment of India. Snould circumstances subsequently change I will resubmit any possible fresh proposals#21 T&gt; 7 f /w C . f\Q jr | Copy or letter No. 26S4 oJ 193^ fiiiifeCL, f Bushire , s the 22nd Decemtier 1932, Iron, tqe HQ5JH[l9i^ thej Political P.esideDt In the Persian Gulf, To 'tne Foreign becretary to the Government of India, in the Foreign and Political vt u Department, New Delhi.

The Political Agent, Ifuscat, has been aSKQd to submit to me his views on the first two points raised in paragraph 2 as Gwadur is under his Political control. 3. as regards the remaining enquiries, (which concern the Jask and Charbar Tunshis and their work) though these two munshis do not now enter into direct correspondence with me, they nevertheless assist the local representatives of the Imperial and International Communications Ltd. and keep them in touph with the local political situation, inasmuch as it might affect the safety and interests of the Telegraph lines and establishment. 4. The Clerks -in-Charge merely furnish me with occasional reports of items considered worthy of trans mission. These Clerks cannot themselves outain such information since, on account of the objections of the Persian Government as originally reported in my pre decessor^ despatch No. 18-T of the 2nd April 1931, they have to be, and are, most careful to avoid taxing any action which might be misconstrued by the Persian authori ties . 5. In my opinion these two Munshis, who receive £NCL 03 lJ*% o ftthiy allowance of Rs. 30/- and Rs. 40/- respectively, INDIA FOREIGN SfCRETA.RY’Sj , . Should be retained pending the grant to the Cl.

The Olerks-in-Charge would principally he concerned with the British and British Indian inhabitants of d’a.SK numbering 25 and Charbar numbering 250 and the Munshis would conduct the vernacular work entailed as well as act in liaison with the Persian authorities. r/ • As regards the suggestion made in paragraph 2(iv) there is no agency which couid perform the Consular duties it is intended to entrust to the senior representa* tives of the Imperial and International Communications ^ at Cask and Charbar. The suggested monthly allowance of Es. 100/- would not appear to be excessive and in any case I do not recommend the consideration of any redue- tionat this stage. 8 * I am forwarding a copy of this despatch to the Minister at Tehran under our letter No. 174/2595, dated the 22nd December 1932.f 1401 5000 11.32 Draft Paper.

WALTOS*Mr. Walto^l, You will remember that there has been considerable correspondence about the grant of the status of Consular Agents to the representatives of the Communications Company at Jask and Charbar - that status having been enjoyed by the corresponding officials of the in the past. The Company agreed in their letter of the 5th November 1931 on P.Z.6975/31 to the grant of such rank to their officers and to the continuance of the allowance of Hs.100 per mensem hitherto paid to officers of the I.E.T.D. holding similar positions, subject, towaver, to a proviso. Prom the Foreign Office letter of 26th January, on P.Z.53^, and the enclosures, it seems clear that 7? considerable difficulty may be anticipated with the Persian Government if we press this proposal, and subject to the Government of India's concurrence the simplest course will, I think, be to &gt; accept the modified arrangement proposed by the Foreign Office.

The Chancery appear to be correct in saying that the Persian Government are within their rights in refusing; and we here should be inclined not to put in an official request, but to content ourselves with arranging with the Communications Company if possible that their officials at Jask and Charbar should perform such duties as the forwarding of passports, passport applications and passnort J.G.

(E 87/87/34) BRITISH LEGATION, Tehran. 14th December, 1932. Dear Department, Your letter of June 16th (E 2887/2887/34) about the grant of Consular rank to the senior officials of the Imperial and International Communications Company at Jask and Charbar. We enclose copies of: 1# A minute by Baggallay dated May 20th. 2. A letter from the Chef du Protocole to the Minister, received as the result of several reminders some weeks after the conversation recorded in the minute. 3. The reply sent to this letter. 4. A copy of a despatch to Bushire. The precise motives of the Persians in turning down this proposal are difficult to ascertain. They may consist in: (a) Remembrance of the complaints made against the Comnany’s officials last year of having usurped Consular functions - comolaints that had very little literal justification, but were psychologically an accurate reflexion of the general position of resnect and influence that the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department had very deservedly acquired and transmitted to their successors in the Company. (b) Eastern Department, The Foreign Office.('b) Dislike of the presence of foreign officials in out of the way places that are in reality under military, not civil, control. The two reasons are largely inter-dependent. Less self-centred and conceited people than the average Persian are apt to harbour a grudge against those who have done them a service, and as the civil and military authorities of these remote places in the south have, we believe, frequently had to take refuge in the Telegraph compound when their town has been invaded by parties of tribesmen, it is not perhaps surprising if they resent the influence of the telegraoh officials or are suspicious of the immunity that telegraph property enjoys. The decision is in any case almost certainly due to the Ministry of the Interior or the military authorities, as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs seem to have been genuinely surprised at it. The present position is that v^e have made a private enquiry as to whether a certain request would be likely to be granted and have been told quite politely that it would not be. We can still make the request officially and press it as strongly as may be thought desirable. It is, however, presumably within the competence of the Persians to say that they will not have Consuls at any given place - compare Darts of India - so that it would be imnossible to insist on a favourable answer. We are sending a copy of this letter to India (No. l/ll-6/l) and to Bushire (No. l/ll-6/2). Yours ever, Chancery.Minute by Mr. L. B aggallay. dated,, 20tU May,..J,952. Farrukh Khan told me a few days ago that the Persian Government did not see their way to permitting the appointment of Consular officers at Jask and Charbar. I asked him to confirm this in writing in reply to our private enquiry (fortunately only private) of March 8th. This he has not yet done. Farrukh as usual explained that he was simply passing on the decision of the 'competent authorities': it had nothing to do with him or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and had come as a surprise to them. He supposed that the authorities did not like having foreign officials of any kind in so orimitive a part of the world. An additional reason is probably to be found in the fact that the proposed nominees were Telegraphs officials, against whom there were so many complaints about a year ago. We had some discussion about these complaints. Farrukh said that the telegranh officials could do anything they liked provided they did it privately. There was nothing to prevent anyone from going to the assistance of a compatriot who got into trouble provided he did not call himself a political officer or Consular officer when he was not one. I said that to the best of my belief only once had an official of the I.I.C.Co., by a slip of the pen, called himself a 'political' officer, and I could not remember it ever having been proved that anyone of them had called himself a 'Consular' officer. Anyhow, that was ancient history now. If he was quite sure that there was no objection to these officials performing certain functionsfunctions (l quoted the collection of passport fees and the transmission of passports) in a purely private capacity, that would meet our requirements to some extent. (in saying this I was not pre-judging what the Minister might say to the Persian Government’s decision). Farrukh repeated that there could he no possible objection, provided the officials did not go giving out that they were agents for the Consul. He was all sweet reasonableness over the performance of these unofficial duties: ’’Anything you like, if it is done privately” was his attitude. If only we could be sure that the local officials would be equally reasonable, we should have little to fear.

Although Mr. Hoare is not aware of the nature of the objections to these appointments, he does not wish to pursue the requres further for the present if in doing so he would seriously embarrass His Highness the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have however informed him of our conversation of a little while back and he notes that there is no objection to the officials of the Company performing in an entirely private and unofficial capacity certain simple duties, such as passing passports or passport applications and fees to and fro between British subjects and the nearest Consular officer.

Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 1033 of May 19th to the Government of India, and to previous correspondence on the subject of the appointment of officials at the Imperial and International Communications Company at Charbar and Jask as honorary Vice-Consuls or Consular Agents, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, copies of private correspondence exchanged on this subject between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Legation, from which you will see that an official application for these officials to be given Consular rank would not be agreeable to the Persian Government, It is true that this decision is not in accordance with the renly given to an earlier unofficial enquiry, but until I receive further instructions from His Majesty’s Government I do not consider it advisable to press the request. 2. I have, however, been informed unofficially by the competent official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that there will be no objection to the oerformance by officials of the Company of certain duties such as the transmission of passports, passport aonlications, fees, etcetera, to and fro between British subjects and the nearest Consular officer. The only condition is that these duties shall be performed in a purely private and unofficial The Honourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bu shire.unofficial capacity and that no attempt he made hy the officials concerned to call themselves ’'Consular” officers or to give out that they are acting as ’’agents” for the Consul. 3. I therefore suggest that the officials concerned should he invited to resume those duties mentioned in naragranh 5 of Major Fowle’s despatch No. 90/1396 of July 4th, 1931, and any similar duties of an equally innocuous kind. It is true that the local Persian authorities may not view the practical oerformance of these duties with the tolerance shown hy the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when discussing them in the abstract. Phis proves to he the case, and ii local explanations lead to no improvement, I should he prepared to approach the Ministry again. I have, etc. (Signed) R. H.

As directed therein I have consulted the Director, Persian Gulf Section - Indo European Telegraphs and the Political Agent, Kalat, regarding the possibility of the reduction of the establishments maintained at Gwadur. Mr. Gunter now informs me that there is no Superintendent of Telegraphs at Gwadur and therefore the proposal made by the Political Agent, Kalat, and communicated to the Government of India in my memorandum Bo.2932, dated the 7th of October 1922 that that official should be given an allowance and should perform the duties of British Agent was based on a misapprehension and is not feasible. 3. Mr. Gunter further states that he could not carry on his duties as Assistant to the Political Agent, Kalat, without a representative at Gwadur and deprecates any reduction in the establishment maintained there which he states was appointed after Sir Amine Dew had gone into the matter on the spot. Colonel Keyes concurs in the view that it is necessary to retain the Agent at Gwadur. The duties of the Agent and the necessity for the expenditure have been given in detail In my memorandum referred to above and it is unnecessary to recapitulate them.

The present position is that the Government of India have reported (3. &amp; 0. 4217/ 32 of 4th June 1932) that they hope before long to be able to approach the Secretary of State on the subject of the maintenance of the Karachi-Gw ad ur line, n The case is somewhat complicated as different interests are concerned and also the question of the maintenance of the new line going Karachi-Gwadur via Panjgur is linked up with this. Our losses on working both lines are so considerable that we are trying to find some solution which while continuing to run the service will enable us at the same time to economise on these lines.' If the result of the examination cf this problem is that the Government of India concur in the proposal that the Communications Company should maintain the line from Jask to the frontier, the Indian Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department maintaining the remaining section fran the Persian frontier to Karachi, no question will arise of the Company’s liability in respect of subsidies to Chiefs in British Baluchistan for the maintenance of the line (unless indeed the Government of India were to claim that the Company should pay some compensation for « being released from such obligations as might properly fall on them in this respect under their agreement^ It is unnecessary therefore, for the moment, to trouble the Government of India^Snthe question of the subsidies and we may await developments on the general question. 3000 531/ MEKRAN COAST LUTE.

SC E.&amp; •0.142/31 dated 23*1.31 • This proposal was sent to the Government of India a for their consideration, together with a note by Sir M. Simpson in which he suggested that the best solution appeared to be that the Company should maintain the line from Jask to the frontier, staffing the offices at Jask and Charbar, and for the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department to maintain the remaining section from the frontier-Karachi, leasing one wire to the Company for Rs.18,500 a year, being the estimated half cost of maintenance. / /E.&amp;*0.1133/31. In a further note, dated 18th February , Sir M* Simpson suggested that, as it would take a little time for theXX H! •&amp; • the Government of India to reply to our letter of 23rd January, the taking over of the Mekran Coast line by the Company should be deferred until the best method for its maintenance was agreed upon, the Indo-European Department in the meantime bearing the cost of maintaining the line, estimated at about Rs.4,500 a month. The Communications Company were accordingly informed on 23rd February that it was proposed, as a purely temporary measure pending an agreement as to the best method of maintaining the line, that it should be maintained by the staff of the Indo- European Telegraph Department without charge to the 0.2230/31. Company. The Government xx of India telegraphed on 27th March, 1931, as follows 'Karachi-Gwadur line is wholly not remunerative and we would not normally maintain it unless required for political and military purposes. The Army and Foreign and Political Departments are considering the question. In the meantime we have issued orders to the Director, Karachi, to take charge of the line provisionally. ^ If the line is not required for political or military purposes we consider that the Communications Company should bear the entire cost of maintenance. 11 Sir M.Simpson noted on this telegram M A further communication from the Government of India must be awaited. Under the agreement the Company undertake the maintenance of the line and to grant facilities to the Government of India for its use. If the Government of India do not require the use of the line presumably the Company will have to maintain it as proposed. It is a question for settlement between the Government of India and the Company 11 . The question seems to have been left at that stage as we do not appear to have had any further comnunication on the subject. Sd. W.R.

The latter was originally a naval flag, and was assigned by the Admiralty as the flag of the Mercantile M&amp;rine. ft is not a shore flag, thougn at one time it was often supposed by Ill-informed persons to be the appropriate flag for non-official British subjects to fly, aa a result of a misunderstand ing as to the propriety of using tne union jac*, waica was wrongly thought to be a purely official flag. d.

Dated July 26th,1931. With regard to the enquiry you have made as to whether the planting of the flag on the ground in front of the Consulate would he against regulations, I have to state that in accordance with international laws the Consuls are only authorised to hoist their flag or Government emblem on the Consulate. But it has never been the custom nor has it been heard of that the flag has been planted by a Consul on the ground of the (his) building, more especially that it should be planted in the public passage. With regard to your statement to the effect that the flag should be hoisted at a place where it can best be seen, you will, therefore, admit that a flag planted above a building can be seen better thaft, on a low ground in front of the house.

G u 1 h e k, Jtily 31s t, 19 31, Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness* Note No. 13594/61012404 of July 26th (Murdad 3i concerning the activities of the officials of the Imperial and International Communications Company in stations on the Persian side of the Gulf and their use of flags. 2. I nave now received from Bushire a report on the substance of Your Highness* note of July 1st (11923/61012404) in which it was stated that the officials in question were flying not only the flag of the Indo-Kuropean Telegraph Department, but also consular flags. I am informed that this statement is not in accordance with the facts of the case as now verified : neither the for: er Department*s flag nor any consular flag has ever been flown by the officials of the Imperial and Internationa] Communications company, but it seems that they have hitherto been flying the flag known as the '*blue ensign** on Sundays and special holidays. The practice of flying an ordinary national flag on holidays is, as ^our Highness will be aware, a very common one in western countries, and one to which no importance is there attached. In London, for instance, foreign flags of every description may be seen, on any day in the year, floating above the business houses of foreign firms. If, in spite of this fact, some special regulation exists in Persia prohibiting this practice, I should be grateful if Your Highness would be so good as to furnish me with the text of it, in order that I may be enabled to acquaint all British firms and other institutions His Highness Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan I'eroughi Minister for Foreign Affairs.institutions in Persia with the exact position. 3. As regards that part of Your Highness' note under reference in which you state that a flag can always he seen better from the roof of a building than from a flagstaff Planted on the ground, I venture to point out that this is not necessarily the case: it may often happen that a flag flown, for instance, over the entrance to a compound is plainly visible, while the house in the compound is hidden i 4 trees; it was that point which -T.bodd doubtless wished to emphasise in his note on the subject. Your highness again refers specifically to the existence of international laws on this subject: X should be grateful if, with a view to clarifying the position, Your Highness would be so good as to furnish me with the text of these laws, since I have been unable to discover anything relevant to the issue in the archives of this legation. 1 avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Y °ur Hi^ness the assurance of my hipest consideration.

As regards the first of these questions, the Government of India agree in their telegram of 28th June on P.Z. 4127/31 that the statement of subsidies enclosed in the Communications Company’s letter of 29th thy on P.Z. 3440/31 in respect of that portion of the line which runs through Persian territory is correct . Paragraph 6 of the Memorandum of Conditions accepted by the Communications Company in connection with the closing down of the I.E.T.D. provides that the Secretary of State shall make efforts to secure cable landing rights a.t Jask, Charbar, Henjam and Bushire and the control, whether by lease cr otherwise, of the Jask- Gwadur line. 'If these efforts are successful, the Jask-Karachi line will be leased to the I. &amp; I.C. Ltd. on a rental of Rs.10 per annum, the I,. &amp; I.C. Ltd, being responsible for upkeep and outpayments ...' The subsidies now under consideration are outpayments of the type in question, and therefore fall to be borne by the Company. 3. In so far as the subsidies (stated in the Government of India’s telegram of 28th June to amount to Rs .19,920) paid to the Chiefs cf British Mekran are payments/✓ •» payments to secure the safety of the line which has been transferred to the Communications Company, they will alsc represent an outpayment which the Company will have to meet. Mr. Slocombe's note of 4th July suggests the possibility that the Government of India might make some claim on the Communications Company under this head in the event of their deciding to continue the British Mekran subsidies, and it will perhaps be well to clear up the point before we put their proposals generally to the Company. We shall be asking a favour of them in respect of the matters referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 below; and it will be better to let them know the full extent of their liabilities at once and avoid having to make a supplementary demand later. I attach a draft. The further report which I they promise in their telegram of 28th June may take time to come, and it seems desirable to dispose of the questions outstanding with the Company without further delay. 3. Arrangements for future discharge of political duties hitherto performed bv I.E.T.D.- These duties are (a) Assistant to the Political Agent, Kalat; (b) political charge of the Mekran coast. x From Colonel de Smidt's letter of 17th March below it will be seen that the post of Assistant to the Political*Agent, Kalat, is largely honorary in character, and the Government of India, in agreement with the Political Resident, consider (paragraph 2 (a) of their air mail letter of 16th May on P.Z. 3383/31) that it may be allowed to lapse. 4. As regards (b). the late Director and the Political Resident recommend that Gwadur should in future &lt;r t be placed under the Political Agent, Muscat, and that the allowances/ P. P Z '-1 oMinute Paper. Department. allowances at present paid in Jask and Charbar (being the allowances referred to in paragraph 2 above) should continue to be issued through the chief officer of the Communications Company at those places (working under the Political Resident, Bushire), who should be granted the allowance hitherto paid to the telegraph clerks in charge, and the allowance for munshis admissible in the past. The Government of India agree and invite us to secure the concurrence of the Communications Company in such an arrangement. 5. A further point of some importance is raised in paragraph 4 of Colonel Biscoe’e despatch of 2nd April, 1931, on P.Z. 3075/31, £i&amp;. , the desirability of giving an official status to the officers in charge at Jask and Charbar. The Government of India recommend that the officials in question should be granted the status of Pro-Consul or of Consular Agent, provided that they are British subjects. The Foreign Office have considered the point in consultation with Sir R. Clive, who is definitely in favour of putting it to the Persian Government, and believes that 'it is not impossible 1 that they may agree (Tehran telegram 143 of 7th July on P.Z. 4390/31 below).

I think we should, lose no time in regularizing the position at Charhar; Jask by asking Persian Govern ment to recognise men as Consular agents. Persian Government have complained more than once recently that these men are exercising functions outside their duties as telegraphists so that there is everything to be gained by asking and I believe it is not impossible that Persian Government may agree. 1 do not think Persian Government will see any connexion between airways question and this request.}Lnj&gt; ‘P'Jjr l^jl Mr.Laithwaite. The agreement with the Company states, it is rv true, that the Jask Karachi line will he leased to the Company on a rental of 10 Rupees per annum, the Company being responsible for upkeep and outpayments. In his letter Colonel de Smidt indicates that the lines in Baluchistan have been transferred to the Indian Telegraph Department. Since the 1st March the stations on these lines, viz. Gwadur, Ormara, Pusni, Turbat, Panjgur, Bela, have been taken over by India and are now treated as stations in India and no longer as stations on the Persian Gulf. From this it would seem to follow that in actual practice the landline between Gwadur and Karachi is only required by the Company for through working in the event of the interruption of the Jask Karachi cable. /hether or not, or to what extent, the Company oan be expected to share in the subsidies paid to the Chiefs in Baluchistan and the Mekran for such contingent use of the Mekran landline is a matter for decision. According to Col. de Smidt*s letter it would appear to be his impression that only the subsidies paid to Chiefs on the Persian side of the Mekran Coast are payable by the Company. The subsidies amounting to Rs.19,920 detailed by him are in respect of the lines east of the Persian frontier and the question he raised in regard to them was whether it was justifiable for the Indian Telegraph Department to be debited with them. It is quite possible that he had in mind that they should more properly be a debit against the rv Political Department. The/The Government of India in their telegram of the 28th June state that the necessity for continuance of the subsidies to Chiefs in British Mekran is under con sideration, and that a further communication on the subject will follow. It seems quite possible from this that the further communication will indicate whether the Company is expected to pay any part of these subsidies.( INDIA. OFFICE, IHITEHAIX? S. . 1.

A.h.L. Cater, Ajent to the Governor - General in Baluchis tan. • (cojjy sent to Tehron)that they will authorise the Imperial and International Communications Company to maintain it« In fact* no arrangements have yet iDeen come to even about the cable rights of the company, and it remains to be seen what attitude the Persian Government will take up. If&gt; however, the land line between Jask and Karachi is maintained, then I think the Imperial and International Communications Company will have to continue the subsidies, or they will find the greatest difficulty in maintaining the line. 4. I agree with Colonel deSmidt tnat Gwadur should, in future, be placed under the political control of the Political Agent, Kuscat, while Jask and Charbar should come directly under the Bushire Residency.^-' At Char oar there is a fairly large Indian mercantile community; Jask is an important station on the Imperial Airways 1 route. Hitherto the senior officer of the Indo- Suropean Telegraph Department at each place has exercised some quasi-political functions, that is to say, he has issued certificates of identity to Indian traders; has assisted them if they had difficulties with the Persian authorities and has submitted reports to the Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department. His position however was entirely irregular and has lately been questioned by the Persian authorities- who have taken objection to the issue of certificates of identity, and these documents have now been discontinued. I consider that it will be desirable to have an officer at each of these places with some sort of official status. His Majesty's Charge d'affaires at Tehran recently suggested to me the desirability of regularising their position. I propose therefore to suggest to His 'lajesty's Charge d'Affaires that they should be given the status of eitherV -3- either a Pro-Consul or Consular Agent. This would, enable them to render assistance to British subjects,Imperial Airways, e-oc., and to keep the Political Besiaent in touch with happenings along the coast. If this suggestion meets with the approval of the Government of India, then I consider that the allowances hitherto paid to the clerks in charge at Jask and Charbar should be continued to the chief officer of the Imperial and International Communica tions Company at those places, together with an allowance of Bs.30/- per mensem to their munshis. . 5. Colonel aeSmiat points out that a saving will be effected of Bs.368/- per mensem, but as political tele grams will not in future be classed as free services tnere will be some increase in telegraphic correspondence. This should not be much as 1 have instructed the clerks in charge to send reports to me by air mail whenever possible, and only in cases of real urgency by telegraph. In view of the fact that Colonel aeSmidt desires to hand over his duties on the 1st Bay, I would request that very early orders may be issued in the matter. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- H.V. Biscoe, Lt. Col., Political Besident in tne Persian Gulf.r W jj'rom To j-iie i^irecoor, Persian Gulf Section; The Hon * hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. No•P.250/600, Karachi, the 17th March 1901. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the post of the director Persian Gulf Section, Inao-Guropean Telegraph Department will cease to exist when I relinquish it on or about the 4th May next ana from that date it will he necessary to make other arrangements for the political auties now performed by me for which I draw a political allowance of Ms.500/- per month. My political auties are (l) Assistant to the Political Agent,Kalat ana (2)in political charge of the Mekran coast. As regards (l) the post is largely honorary ana is chiefly in connection with the fact that the subsidies drawn by various chiefs in Baluchistan ana the lekran,as detailed below,are paid by the Indo-European telegraph Deoartment. Subsidy paid to the Chief of tharan Ms.4000 oer annum ' ' « ' Jam of Las-Bela ' 9600 Additional presents to tribal chiefs ' 800 Kedj subsidy ' 4520 Pashi ' ” 520 Kolwa • '* 480 Total Hs.19,920 ' Whatever may have been the position when the telegraph lineslines were iDuilt it is doubtful whether it is justifiable at the present day to debit these subsidies to the Telegraph Administration and I have no doubt that this matter will be taken up by the Post and Telegraph Department to v/hich these lines have been transferred. It may be noted however that the Las-Bela and Kedj subsidies are determined in agreements made and signed by the Assistant Commissioner in Sindh, with the Jam of Las-Bela on 21st December 1361 and with the Naib of Kedj on the 24th January 1862. The post of the Assistant to the Political Agent Kalat may,I think, be allowed to lapse. The political charge of the Mekran coast chiefly concerns Jask and Charbar v/hich are in Persia and Gwadur which belongs to the Jus cat State. The trade of these places is almost entirely in the hands of British Indian subjects and is chiefly with Karachi. It has therefore been a useful arrangement to give political charge to the Director of the Department in Karachi. The Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs* political establishment is as follows:- Director,Persian Gulf Telegraphs political allowance As. 300 p.m. Kunshi(pay Bs.168 not debited to Political Department)allowance it 48 tf „xS s i s t an t munshi . . n 20 h British Agent, Gwadur o 150 H 2 menials 33 II * allowance to the clerk-in-charge,Jask &lt;1 • 100 It Munshi 30 It X Allowance to the clerk-in-charge, Charbar. it 100 It Munshi i» 30 It Total As. 811 It Subsidies paid to chiefs on the Persian llekran coast totallingtotalling its.5,840/- per annum are entirely Tor the purpose or protection to the ielegraph lines ana will he paia in nature,it is unaerst&amp;oa, by the Imperial ana International Communications Company.

A saving will he effected, of about rvs.568/- per mensem hut as political telegrams will not in future he classed, as free services there will be some increase under telegraphic charges.
