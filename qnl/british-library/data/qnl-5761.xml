If the Muslim High Priests and spiritual fathers of the nation—may God increase their number—were acquainted with the requirements of the age and knew the exigencies of the times, in reply to such queries they would have told the people to become energetic and take practical steps. By doing so they would have saved themselves from being laughed at, as such a procedure is quite useless. They would, moreover, have preserved the importance and value of their orders. We have repeatedly said before and say again that circumstances have changed, and any party that does not act according to circumstances cannot expect its words to have any effect or its deeds to bear any fruit. We remem ber seven years ago when the Islamia Co-operative Society were trying to encourage the use of goods manufactured in the country, the public took up the matter with great enthusiasm, and we heard then that certain ignorant students of religious law were trying to obtain a decree from Haji Shaikh Muhammad Taki, Mujtahid, commonly known as the Aghai Najafi—may God the Most High protect him—declaring the use of foreign goods as haram (forbidden). When this news reached the (Habl-ul-Matin) Office, the follow ing representation was made to His Holiness :— “ I am not afraid of the Turk archers. The reproaches of the persons who pick up the arrows are killing me. It is evident that failure to carry out the orders of the ulema is an insult to the Muhammadan law. As we know for certain that at present an order declaring the use of foreign goods as haram (forbidden) cannot be carried out for various reasons, we have considered it necessary to bring it to your notice that such an ord6r should not be issued, as it is bound to be ignored and is likely to bring the Muslim spiritual leaders into contempt. The order regarding the unlawfulness of the use of foreign goods should cot be verbal, but a practical one. That is to say, energetic efforts should be made to introduce factories into the country in order to be able to turn out the required goods cheaply, so that the importation of foreign goods into our country may not pay. The foreigners buy cotton and wool from us and bring them back to us (after manufacture). The cost of carriage both ways is enormous; and as there is dearness in Europe, the w T ages of workmen and labour ers is much higher there. The personal expenses of the Europeans are also higher than our expenses. Therefore, taking everything into consideration, if we manage to possess factories and the art of manufacture, we are sure to turn out goods at a cost at least twenty per cent cheaper than that of foreign goods.If we can sell our goods even half per cent cheaper than foreign goods, naturally the foreigners will declare the entry of their goods into our country unlawful, as it will not pay them to import their goods. But if the foreigners can land goods in our country even half per cent cheaper than our goods, such a fatva (expression of legal opinion), or even a hundred thousand fatvas like it will not have any effect whatever. The question of the Regie was another matter, and the times were then different. Besides this, the use of tobacco cannot be looked upon as one of the necessaries of life, and the circumstances at that time differed so much that it is not necessary to discuss that question here • If the High Priests wish that their orders should have effect in the minds of the people, and that the latter should act on them, it is necessary at the begin- nino* for the High Priests themselves to set the example. Should the High Priests, without going so far as to declare the use of foreign goods as unlawful, personally and coUectively give up the use of foreign goods altogether, some effect is bound to be produced in the minds of the people and the demand tor foreign goods is sure to decrease. There is no doubt that, if the ulema be desirous of wearing cloths manufac tured in the country, they can procure them with the utmost ease. Then the practice of the ulema is sure to be adopted by the students, and every one associated with the ulema will also be inclined to wear home-made goods. If the ulema verbally declare clothes made of cloth manufactured in 1 ersia as a mark of holiness and justice, one-third of the inhabitants of Persia will before long, be dressed in clothes made of ^ cloths manufactured in Persia, and*the desired end will be gained without foreign cloths being declared haram (forbidden). When five or six crores of Persians give up the use of foreign goods on this principle, at least twenty crores will be added annually to the wealth of the inhabitants of Persia, and gradually one crore of the children of our dear country will get occupation and work. On the contrary, if the High Priests give such/a^a on the one hand, and on the other hand make use of foreign cloth in their outer or inner compart ments from necessity or habit, the people will not listen to a hundred thousand orders like this. It is only not wearing and giving up the use of cloths of foreign manufacture by the High Priests that can act as a great stimulant to push forward such a scheme. We hope that the Muslim High Priests will devote a little attention to the exigencies of the times, and that they will not precipitate themselves into pitfalls laid for them by their ignorant friends, and thus make themselves the laughing stock of the Persians and foreigners. It is clearly perceptible that this°order of the ulema cannot be carried out, and naturally it would deteriorate the value and importance of the Muhammadan spiritual leadera and bring the Muhammadan religious law into contempt. Moreover when foreigners see that the orders of the Muhammadan religious authorities regarding them have not been carried out, they will become bolder than ever and the greatness and importance of Islam will disappear from the eyes of friend and foe. A command to do what is lawful and to avoid what is unlawful should depend on circumstances. In this case it is not sufficient to give it only m writing. Wise and successive speeches from the pulpit and discourses m private meetings, as the occasion may require, are wanted, and it is necessary for the High Priests to adopt practical and direct measures to give up the use of articles of foreign manufacture in their own households and in those of their adherents. In this manner these measures will gradually have ellect m the minds of the nation. In such fatvas, the subject matter of which concerns the general public and foreigners and is based on politics, the utmost care and forethought are necessary, since the foreigners are very acute and the common members of our nation are ignorant and destitute of knowledge, while some among them who are clothed in the garb of knowledge are ready to squander an Imperial in the purchase of a string for the tunic and sacrifice their lives in gamingns they have adopted in religious matters. By their efforts thousands of (religious) schools have been established in which hundreds of thousands of students are learning religious law and receiving spiritual education. They should follow the same principle in the civil matters of the nation also. If ten thousand Persian youths are taught the modern technical science and are properly trained, they can undertake everything to meet all require ments. But should the High Priests wish to act otherwise and try to do the whole work by fatvas and to compete with the other nations on equal terms without supplying the wants of the people, the attempt will be in vain. In that case they will not only make a mistake themselves, but will mislead the people also. Some ignorant people think that all accusations attributed to the ulema have been removed, but in the opinion of the wise such misguided steps cannot remove those accusations. If it is asserted that such matters are not within the sphere of action of the ulema&gt; the answer will be that it is also out of place for the ulema to give such fruitless fatvas which only make them the laughing stock of the Muslims and foreigners. If it is said that the ulema will not be listened to in such matters, then the reply will be that if this be true such fatvas even will not be listened to. What then is the use of the ulema making themselves the laughing stock of the people under the impression of removing the accusations brought against them. If we go into the matter deeply, it will not be advisable to make such a statement, as the Persian public are faithful followers of the ideas of their spiritual leaders, and all other Muhammadans also listen to their orders. For instance, in former times, the ulema^ according to exigencies of the times, advised the people to make roads, build bridges and caravansarais, and repair sacred shrines, and in a short time the Muhammadan countries became full of such buildings. For some time past the spiritual leaders have been advising the people to build places of mourning for Imam Hasan and to hold prayer meetings (in commemoration of the Imams). Now it is observed that the people have taken up the matter so earnestly that there is scarcely a household (in Persia) which does not spend a large sum of money for this purpose every year. A careful scrutiny will show that the Persian nation spends more monev on this than other nations spend on all charitable works put together. From'this it is evident that the ulema have great influence in the minds of the people which they can turn in any way they like. But to give effect to any idea it is necessary that the ulema should personally take part in it and not content themselves with words only. If the ulema devote their attention to improve the material condition of the people and advise them to acquire technical education with a view to scientifically carrying on manufactures and agriculture by impressing upon them that these matters are as important for the political existence of Islam and the Muslims as prayer meetings of mourning for the Imams and that expenditure on the latter might be reduced to find funds for the former, in a short time the nation will become educated and able, and having acquired technical sciences wall be fit to compete with European nations on equal terms. Thus the wealth of the Muhammadan countries will be preserved, and the demand for and entry of foreign goods in Persia and other Muhammadan countries will naturally decrease and become haram (forbidden); because when Europeans find that they suffer loss by exporting goods to Muhammadan countries, they would themselves consider it haram (forbidden) to send any goods to those countries. Without this procedure if all the Ulema combine and issue a thousand fatvas a day, the wants of the nation will not be supplied in the least. Civilisation is daily on the increase : people are becoming accustomed to live in comfort and luxury and can no longer pass their lives as nomads and savages. We should speak more plainly perhaps. While fine and soft long cloth is procurable at a low price, the people will never buy their own rough coarse and expensive country cloth, and no one can be blamed for it, as it is quite natural. If the High Priests wish to provide necessaries of life for the people, they ought to take such steps as may induce the nation to make their own long cloth and be able to sell it cheaper, so that loss in importing foreign long cloth may make the latter’s entry into our country haram (forbidden).Translation of an article in the “ Habl-ul-Matio ”, No. 34, dated the 4th May 1906. A LETTER FROM HOLY NAJAF. As the sacred newspaper (“ Habhul-Matin ”) has been recognized as the proclaimer of the improvements of the Muslims, the learned High Priests and theologists of Islam depend on the “ Habl-ul-Matin ” for the publication, for the information and guidance of the Islamitic world, of the strenuous efforts made and measures adopted by those holy personages for the revivification and advancement of Islam. For some time past the general public have apparently been casting a slur on the Muslim High Priests and theologists by bringing unjust imputations against them and accusing them of selfishness and indifference to religious affairs. Last week I sent you photographed copies of an istifta [consulting a lawyer and asking for his fatwa (expression of legal opinion) on a point of religious law] and the answer for fatwa (expression of legal opinion)] of the learned theologists, which, I believe, you have inserted in the “Habl-ul- Matin This week I send you photographed copies of another istifta and the answer of the High Priests which I am directed by those learned personages, whom we are bound to obey, to ask you to insert in the “ Habl-ul-Matin ” without any hesitation or delay. M. A. [Muhammad Ali]. Query. Demonstrators of Islam! The news of the animosity of the Armenians of the Caucasus towards the Muslims and of the conflicts and fighting between these two peoples which h:is spread in the world has no doubt reached the ears of the High Priests. The Muslims require instruments of war which now-a-days mean rifles, &amp;c., for defending themselves against the Armenians. Most Muslims, however, can not afford to purchase arms without which they are unable to protect their lives, honour (of women), and property. In consequence of this, thousands of Muslims have lost their lives and property. In these circumstances, can the rich purchase arms out of their tithes or in particular out of the share of the Imam—on whom be peace—and supply them to the other Muslims to enable them to use them in defending themselves and protecting the offspring of Islam, or not, and whether in such cases is it incumbent on all M uslims or not that every one should, as far as lies in his power, give help to the Muslims of the Caucasus in the shape of men, money, and arms ? If any of the Muslims in Persian or Turkish territory who can help in the sending of arms should neglect to send arras, even for sale, will he be guilty of committing a haram (forbidden or unlawful) act or not ? Answer. In the name of God, the Most High and Glorious 1 Yes, it is incumbent on all Muslims to assist the Muslims of the Caucasus in every possible manner. For instance, in the sale of arms, it is incumbent and binding on every one who can to cause arms to reach them in any way that it may be possible. If any person neglects to do this, he will be a sinner, because now-a-days the state of affairs in the Caucasus is the state of (Muslim) defence against aliens and- enemies of Islam ; nay it is a kind of jihad (reli gious war against infidels) in which it is incumbent on women also to takei active part. Therefore, it is the duty of every Muslim to render every assistance in lives, money, supplies, arms, and refuge, &amp;c , to the Muslims of the Caucasus. It is a matter for great surprise that such a matter as this, which is one of the requirements of Islam and dictates of common sense, should have been considered as standing in need of elucidation. At the time of the attack of the enemies of religion it is incumbent on every Muslim to join in the defence. All Muslims are permitted to spend the share of the Imam out of their money on this path for the love of God. Signature of Haji Saiyid Ali, Razavi, of Tabriz, residing at Najaf. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, who is to be relied on. The facts are as the answer written above. In a state of defence in a war against aliens it is incumbent on the Muslims to allow no neglect in wnat they can do, if God the Most High wills. Seal of Ismail, Musavi, son of Sadr-ud-Din of Amul. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate ! The protection of the lives and honour of the Muslims is obligatory on all Muslims possessing means, even if it should involve expenditure of money. In case there is no liberal person among the wealthy, or their number is not suffi cient, the tithes may be used for the purpose, as one of the legitimate purposes for the expenditure of zakat (alms given accordingto Muhammadan law by way of purifying or securing a blessing to the rest of one’s possessions) is the way of God under which heading this matter falls. Please God, the faithful brethren—may God the Most High give them the resources—the well-to-do and wealthy will carry out their obligations and not hesitate to spend their money in this matter in any way that there may be need for it, so that it may not be necessary to spend the tithes or the share of the Imam, on whom be peace. May the Master of the Universe grant all of them magnanimity and liberality ! Signature of Muhammad Kazim, Tabatabai. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate ! It is incumbent and obligatory on every Muslim to assist the Muslims against infidels in any way that may be possible by spending any share of the shares on which depends the strengthening of Islam and the weakening of the power of infidels. Seal of Muhammad Husain, son of the late Haji Mirza Khalil. r In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate ! It is obligatory on all Muslims to aid and assist the Muslims whether it be by purchase of arms, or w ? ar materials, or otherwise, in actions involving the protec tion of their lives or honour or property and the necessary shares (tithes, &amp;c.) may be utilized for the purpose. One of the legitime items for which zakat may be employed is expenditure in the way of God under which heading falls the matter in question. If no other fund is available, the share of the Imam— on whom be peace—can also be utilized for the purpose. • Signature of Abdulla of Mazandaran.Copy.

There are grouiids for believing that there is at the present time a recrudescence of the pan-Islamic propaganda and that agents are being sent from Turkey and 1'gypt to India and other parts of the hast. Me know that a Turk named Muhammad Anas or Axiis went to Kabul in April last. x Hamid Beg and Jamil hffendi, ] and two Afghans who were accompanied by a servant i arid lived for a long time in Syria left Peshawar for Kabul on 12th June 1006. Another exiled Afghan named Abdul Baki Khan, who landed at Karachi and remained for some time at Sukkur awaiting funds, is now on his way to Kabul. This man poses as a friend of the British but he is an inveter ate intriguer and little reliance can be placed on his good faith. All these men are believed to be bearers of letters from Turkey to Afghanistan. The foreign department desire that steps may be taken to watch carefully for any indications of the existence of political correspondence between the Amir and the Sultan of Turkey or any other Muhammadan potentate* and a watch should also be kept for all foreign Musalmans, notably Turks and Arabs from Bgypt or Turkish Arabia, who may pos sibly be emissaries of the pan-Islamic league. Inquiries on this subject should be made with great discretion and on no account should Superintendents of Police issue gene ral instructions to their subordinates. It is only in a few places that such emissaries are likely to be found and it is only there that inquiries need be made. Information should be sought not only from subordinate police officers x named Muhammad r usuf exiled by the late Amirbut also from such other official and non-official indi^ x viduals as are likely, in the opinion of the district magistrate arid the Superintendent, to know of the presence of pan-Islamic agents.

The most important thingjf hat the Sheikh of Kowe it has given up his neutrality and has open ly taken protection of the English u You have heard that Mubarek Ibn i Sabah sent a telegram to the Sublime Porte, intimating that if the Turkish troops did not abstain from helping Ibn i Rashid then he would assist Ibn i 'Saood, and seek protection of a foreign power, who would protect him from all liamn % He further added in the telegram that Foreign powers desire to extend their protection to the Arab Amirs, but the latter prefer to remain subjects of His Vajesty the 'ultan % But the Sublime Porte did not send him a reply m Con sequently Mubarek sought protection of the English who have been trying to gain this object for four years past % On the 8th April 1903, Hr Balfour stated in the House of Commons, that the Sheikh of Kowe it had entered into special agreements with the English % But the Sheikh re pudiated this statement and said that he was subject to the Sublime Porte.

But the English Consul came there and shut their mouths and pressed their hands, and prevented them from making futther inspection of the cases, and the arms were restored to the owners, who took them over to Sheikh Mubarek Thus Ibn i Sacod obtains his arms from Koweit and the latter from the English; and so the English are the Agents, who supply the Arabs with arms 9 I know as a fact that had not the English made a present of four guns to Mubarek, the latter would not have been able to capture Boreida, which is a strong position and con sidered in Arabia to be invincible % V, Jll ‘.A j It is ojten that Mubarek has not to pay for these' ahms and ammunition, because if he had to do so, he would soon be reduced to poverty 9 A short time after this the English sent him a lakh of rupees % The ‘rab rebels cannot find a better help , You may re member that Eheikh Ha'dun bin Mansur, 9 the Sheikh of the Muntafik tribe attacked a detachment of Turkish troops in December last, and then raided the suburbs of Busreh % Y-Tien he feared retribution he took refuge at Kcweit, and remained under the protection of English guns.

A LETTER FROM HOLY NAJAF. The ' Habl-ul-Matin ”, which is recognized as a newspaper intended to inspire the Muslims with courage to improve their condition, has written some effective articles to try and persuade the High Priests to act according to the exigencies of the times. In course of these articles it has respectfully made certain hints and objections. As the intentions of the editor of the “ Habl-ul- Matin ” are good, the Muslim High Priests—may God increase their number— at Naiaf have been stirred up to such an extent that they have become ready to devise schemes beneficial to the country and the nation. Accordingly a query was specially submitted to those personages to which they replied. I send you photographed copies of the query and the replies for your information. Please order the correspondence to be inserted in the “ Habl-ul-Matin ” so that the charge of apathy often preferred against the Muslim High Priests by the public may be removed :— Query. Demonstrators of Islam! What is the religious order regarding wares, cloths and goods bought by the Muslims from foreigners when similar articles are either already produced by the Muslims themselves, or are possible to be manufactured by them in factories which can be opened, particularly when their purchase from foreigners by Muslims is likely to practically impoverish and weaken the Muslims even tually, and to seriously interfere with the influence and dignity of Islam ? Is it necessary or not that the Muslims should open their own factories, as far as possible, and avoid making purchases from foreigners ? When a Muslim has a certain article as well as a non-muslim, is it necessary that Muslims should purchase it from the Muslim or not ? In this case is purchase from a non-muslim haram (forbidden) or not ? Replies of Muslim High Priests. (Received in the “ Habl-ul-Matin ” Office in the order given here.) In the name of God, the Powerful, the Glorious ! Yes. When the Muslims can establish factories to manufacture goods which they need for their consumption, it is obligatory on them to adopt measures to do so and avoid giving their money, which is the source of the maintenance of their lives, to foreigners for the purchase of perishable goods. It is incumbent on all Muslims to have, as far as possible, all their dealings with the Muslims ; and when certain goods are procurable from the Muslims, it is advisable, in the interests of Islam, that such goods should be bought from them and not from non-muslims, as acts like these are calculated to strengthen Islam and to increase the power of the Muslims. It is obligatory and incum bent on all Muslims to keep these points in view. In the cases mentioned purchase of goods from foreigners is haram (forbidden), as it is calculated to increase the power of the enemies of Islam.

The truth is that the reply given above is very accurate and correct. In perfect aloofness from foreigners lie the strength and protection of Islam and the Muslims. May God grant all Muslim brethren the power to act on this principle! Signature and seal of Saiyid Ismail Musavi, son of Sadr-ud-din of Amul. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate ! Anything that is the cause of strengthening and giving power to the unbelievers and infidels and of the weakening of Islam and the Muslims is haram (forbidden), whether it be in the nature of business dealings or other things. It is absolutely necessary that all Muslims should, as far as possible, without causing any mischief, avoid things which are likely to strengthen the infidels and which are actually doing so. May God grant all Muslims power to protect and support the true faith of the noblest of prophets, may God’s blessings be on him and his holy descendants.

Sidduk mentions a quotation from Aba Abdulla, the truthful—on whom be peace—in which the latter says“ Indeed God has sent the following injunction to some of his prophets—on whom be peace £ tell the faithful not to wear the clothes of my enemies, nor eat their food, nor follow in their paths, otherwise they will be my enemies Most of the mischief which has found its way into the acts and creeds of the Muslims has arisen out of their dealings with the infidels and imitation of their ways and methods and of the infidels having monopolized all trade in goods, wares, cloths, instruments, medicines and vessels in all cities. There is nothing left of the necessaries of life which is not now supplied by them. The most noble of the prophets—may God’s blessings be on him and his holy descen dants—truly prophesied :— “ Islam began in poverty and will rise in poverty”. How good will it be, if the Muslim’s sense of honour is roused a little and they feel shame and resentment.

Therefore, it is necessary for the ulema, before they proceed in such a matter, to obtain the consent and co-operation of the whole of their class, so that no one may have the courage to do anything in opposition to it. A strong power is required to enforce such an order. No one can deny that the answer to the query in this matter is based on common sense and is comprehensible to every Muslim child with any intelligence. In fact, this answer has not elucidated anything that was not already known to the nation; but of course the object of the Muslim High Priests is that the matter should not remain confined to words only, but that it should take a practical shape. It is an admitted fact that, according to international law and existing treaties with other Powers, the Persian Government is unable to enforce such an order, and the power of the ulema depends on the support of the people for whom it is difficult to obey such an order with sincerity unless they see that the ulema themselves and their families and adherents have personally given up the use of articles of foreign manufacture. We now come to the real point. Supposing that all the ulema unite and the whole nation follow them in this matter, the question is can we succeed in such a scheme or not ? In our opinion, and in the opinion of all acquainted with the exigencies of the times, it is impossible for this order to be thoroughly carried out by the general public without the preliminary steps which are necessary to be taken in such matters ; if the importation into Persia of cloths and stuffs of foreign manufacture ceases at once, Persian men will remain without shrouds and Persian women in nudity, and they will be reduced to a savage state. Persia itself cannot provide the luxuries and necessaries of life according to the present day requirements of the civilised Persians, and it is necessary to import everything from foreign countries. It is impossible to suddenly give up the use of those articles, as it is not possible to arrange to produce them forthwith in Persia. The cloths manufactured in Persia are limited, and though they are of very fine quality and strong texture, they are not turned out in sufficient quantities to meet all requirements, and are moreover very expensive. The pre sent outturn of the whole of Persia in cloths and stuffs is not even sufficient for a month’s requirements of the population of Persia. In former days the outturn was much higher and the taste of the Persians was different. One tunic was considered sufficient for the use of several generations; but now one person requires several tunics a year, and it is not possible to make the people go backwards and revert to the old state of affairs. It is, therefore, necessary “ first to dig a well and then to steal a minaret”, or, in other words, steps should be taken at first to supply locally the require ments of the nation, without putting them to any inconvenience, and then to prevent the entry of foreign goods into Persia. In that case also it will not be necessary to declare foreign goods as haram (forbidden). As soon as Persia can produce locally made articles cheaper than goods of European manu facture, the entry of the latter in the country will become haram (forbidden) by itself, as Europeans consider it haram (forbidden) to suffer any loss in trade. We ought to devise some plan to enable us to compete with our neigh bours on equal terms. At present our rivals are going in railway trains, while we are riding lame donkeys: our neighbours possess Krupp guns and magazine rifles, while we have only wooden sticks and double edged swords: our European rivals have weaving mills worked by steam, while we do not possess even hand-looms: we cannot turn out a couple of yards of country cloth in a day, while our European rivals can produce two hundred-thousand yards of fine long cloth per diem. It is evident that until we can procure what our rivals already have, we cannot compete with them; and until we can supply our own wants according to the requirements of the times, no one can prevent the entry into Persia of goods of foreign manufacture of which the people stand in need. You have tied me up to a plank in midstream. Still you teil me to be careful and not to wet my clothes.Want breaks all blockades put up to prevent the entry of the forbidden article. If the High Priests are really desirous of enforcing the dictates of the Muhammadan religious law and of relieving the Muhammadan nation of want and poverty, it is necessary to do it in a businesslike manner, as wise men have said :— “ Enter houses by their doors ”, The answer to the query was no doubt evident and nothing new has been said by the High Priests. If the object is only to disprove the accusations brought against the High Priests by the public or people imitating the Euro peans and to remove their objections, the result is sure to be contrary to the one desired. But if it is really intended to remove the poverty and to preserve the wealth of the Muhammadan countries, the right way to bring that about is this :—The Muhammadan nation should be encouraged to form companies of industry, and all the ulema who have the means should be share-holders in them as far as possible. But these companies should not be conducted on the lint s of the former Persian Companies whose object in booming was only “to deprive Mulla Nasr-ud-din of his quilt” (i.e. to rob the people), as in a short time the odour of their dirty work made the whole Muhammadan world stink, in consequence of which Persia has been thrown back a hundred years in the matter of joint-stock companies. Special knowledge and qualifications are required to form a company of share-holders. It will do no harm to the reputation of such and such a Persian trader, or such and such a priest, if we say that they do not know how to start and conduct a joint-stock company of share-holders. We should employ foreign ers of experience to start such concerns for us and gradually acquire experience and learn work from them. We cannot forego the good of a large majority for the mischief of a small minority, and the undertaking is in no way opposed to the Muhammadan religious law. We quote one instance to prove our assertion. The Imperial Bank of Persia belongs to a very small company with a very small capital which was formed in England. This company engaged a few trained and experienced men and deputed them to Persia. This handful of officials have made a fool of thousands of Persian traders and bankers, nay the whole Persian nation. The reason is that those handful of officials are learned men, and we are ignorant. Should we be desirous of forming companies for purposes of industry, trade, banking, or agriculture, we must, at the beginning, borrow skilled and experienced men from foreign countries to conduct the business for us and to teach us the work. Our own power of discernment will be of no avail in this matter, nor will our morals, logic or explanatory science be of any use. Until we form com panies to meet all our requirements, we shall not be able to accomplish anv- thing, and a hundred thousand fatvas like this will remain a dead letter. The points 'which we have brought to notice are in no way opposed to the Muham madan religious law. It is a thousand pities that all our communities are so far absorbed in verbal discussions only and are not seriously thinking of any practical work. A few speeches intended to make a reputation suitably or unsuitably and to quiet a class of people without any intellect are considered sufficient. This procedure is not confined to people of the lower classes only, and it mav be said that it is at the bottom of all the evils from which Persia, nay the wliole of Islam, is suffering. Should the spiritual leaders be anxious to relieve the Muhammadan nation of want so that they may be able to compete with the civilised nations on equal terms, or even to surpass them, they ought to deeply go into the causes which led to the improvement of the other nations. We can say without hesitation tnat the foreign nations owe their improvement to their sciences. Until we acquire those sciences and experiences, it is impossible for us to compete with them on equal terms. No fool can compete with a wise man and no ignorant man can compete with a learned person. If the Muslim High Priests are determined to educate their nation, the proper way to do this is to adopt the same measures in matters of civilised lifetot'eiga Otfcco Proas—Ko.

There is no objection to the utilization of zakat money or even the share of the Imam—on whom be peace—if no other funds are available, and when no one is liberal enough to provide other funds for the purpose. May God grant us and the brethren of our religion, power and strength to carry out their religious obligations ! Seal of Haji Mirza Fathulla of Ispahan. The Habl-ul-Matin. Use a cure so that my heart may not bleed. What is the use of wiping tears off my face. It appears from the letters received from holy Najaf that the Muslim High Priests and spiritual fathers of the nation, i.e., the learned Ulema—may God increase their number—are zealously using their best endeavours in Islamitic improvements which may be looked upon as the best sign of the good fortune of the Muhammadan nation. What is, however, considered a matter for regret by the wise is indifference to the exigencies of the times displayed by those great men in their deeds and words. Por instance, this fatva will be of no use or consequence to the Muhammadans of the Caucasus or other places, as the matter has not been dealt wuth in the proper way.^ The orders of the High Priests will, therefore, appear as fruitless and useless in the eyes of friend and foe and will lose their value and import ance. This is the reason why even in some important matters, in which the force and importance of the orders of the Ulema should be operative, do not have the desired effect. If the learned Ulema really wish that the Muhammadans should improve their condition, the proper way to bring about such improvement is this. They should at the outset set aside their religious differences in anv way that may appear to them desirable; form union societies; use their high educational qualifications in removing from the principles of their religion everythinsj that causes friction and hatred among the different sects of Islam; preach Muham madan morals and impart to the Muhammadans primary education in the tenets of Islam. The result of these measures will perhaps be long in making its appearance, but the benefits will be everlasting, provided, of course, that the Ulema themselves entirely co-operate with each other in such matters and no differential voice be raised from among them, since the differ ences existing among the Muhammadans have been and are the outcome of confusion in the opinions of the different Ulema. Secondly, the Ulema should encourage and popularize the art of defence by exercising and instructing their congregation in defence manoeuvres and drill in the squares of their mosques before prayers and giving a practical shape to their words. Instead of writing useless pamphlets on defence they should show something practical to the people, and such measures cannot become popular unless the Ulema personally take part in them. The exigencies of the times require that now-n-days the Muslim High Priests should impart instruction to the people in the exercise of modern art of defence in the squares of their mosques before they deliver religious lecturesto them. This measure is in no way opposed to the religion and cannot have any derogatory effect on the dignity of those personages. On the contrary, such a measure will enhance their value, remind the people of the early period of Islam and give new life to the faded bodies of the Muhammadans. The Muhammadans are, moreover, devoting their attention to unite themselves with Muhammadan Powers; hut this idea cannot be realized with out the attention of the Hk-h Priests. If the Muhammadan nations unite with the Muhammadan Powers, all the Muhammadans of the East and the West will gain spiritual strength and make extraordinary advancement. Then even if there be a single Muhammadan in a town he would command great influence and awe among all the inhabitants of that town. The reason why the Muhammadans are at present treated with contempt and oppressed in every countrv and by every other nation is that aliens know that the Muhammadans have no supporter, and they believe that if the Muhammadan cannot protect themselves against oppression no one will come to their rescue, hut if the Muhammadans unite and the Muhammadan Powers are strong, the Muham madans would not fall a prey to the high-handedness of the aliens or be treated with contempt even in their own homes. Supposing that, in accordance with this fntva of the Ulema, the Muhammadans come into possession of arms, of what use can those arms be to them when they have no practice and do not know how to handle them ? There is no doubt that this fatva of the Ulema is politic, hut in politics one must move with diplomacy, i.e., in such a manner as to attract no attention so that the desired end may be obtained without exciting any suspicions. On the contrary, however, this fatv^ without having any result is warning the adversaries to be on the alert and prepared. There are many points in such matters which had better remain unsaid. If God wills it, our High Priests will understand them without our mentioning them.
