Your telegram No. 170, not repeated to Bahrein: sale of I.N.F.C. quota of wheat by Koweit to satisfy Arabian merchants. I can see no objection to such communication to Ibn Saud but I doubt v/hether it will have any appreciable effect. The Saudi Arabian Government has always played fast and^ loose with their quota allocations and no doubt regard Koweit as a convenient centre for unauthorised transactions. In addition there is at present a marked shortage of cereals in the country. Price of bread in Jedda has recently risen by 1 - 11th. .an interesting side-light is that when a member of my staff recently took an opportunity to raise this matter indirectly with Yusuf asin, Yusuf Yasin said with some bitterness that Britain always dealt more generously with the smaller than with the larger [? grp omitted] and went on to say that the bazaars of Bahrein and oilman were over-flowing in contrast with Saudi-Arabia. It was pointed out to him that it was the I.E.F.C. which allocated wheat and no longer the Middle East Supply Centre. But this of course does not affect his general point especially as it is^true at least of Bahrein that the bazaar is better supplied with United Kingdom goods than those of Saudi Arabia, from which no doubt he mistakenly deduces that they have ample stocks of everything.

Second alternative is not practicable since Saudi Arabia is supplied direct by United States, [Copy sent to Middle East Secretariat]Hegardinr the former it would s^em that the Port Director, Basra referred to Iraqi wheat at £90 a ton, why in that event he should have added that it was from Wut' is not clear. It is quite possible that the •rovernment of India did buy some quantity of wheat for which they were unable to export licences. V/e had a similar experience with regard to barley, but we had to sell the unshipped quantity to the Iraqui Government at about the price we paid for it. If the Indians ware able to retain their wheat and sell it privately to the Port Director at around £90 a ton they probably did very well on the transaction, but it does not seem that we need pursue the matter further. * Tele, ram No. 22 is not, however, so easily disposed of. It is stated that the Koweilf Oil Company has received only one consignment of 165 tons of wheat and, that wheat is issued by the compary only to 2,725 persons. .’hile it would be correct to say that only one release of I 65 tons has been made there has been a previous release of 150 tons and we are ^Iso supplying the company with flour. The present allocations are based on the understanding that th^y represent the requirements of upwards of 5,000 persons, at about 1 lb. per head per day. If related to only 2,725 persons the quantity would be excessive. 1 A. A. Harrison, Esq., .Commonwealth delations Office, Thitehall, S.V/.l. /AccordingAccording to the toli.ical Resident consumption of wheat in Magwa and Ahmadi has increased from 42 to 97 tons a month and the additional consumers are all eirrplov-ed 4/ in connection 'dth oil company-work'* At 1 lb. per head per day this additional 55 tons ’atouI d represent about 4 &gt; 00 C persons or a total labour force of upwards of 9,000 persons. Additionally, i t wo pdd seem there is a labour force supplied by contractors and borne on the Oil Company's books, while the prosperity of the towns referred to above has attracted an additional population, ap&gt;art from direct and contract labour. It is obvious that we shall have to obtain from the oil company full particulars of their labour force, the ration scales in force, and the numbers supplied by the company direct. It is, however, stated and I think correctly, that the main cause of thp shortage of wheat in Koweit is the sale of wheat to SaOd Arabians and in January last this amounted to as much as 43h tons. Fhere is no reason, sp far as I am aware, why Ib«y Sand should prohibit his people buyinr vdieat fro .t Koweit* The solution, in the absence of Persian supplies, must be the prohibition of sales. he traders in Koweit have no doubt found it a very profitable trade, but under no circumstances could the Ministry of Food agree to find wheat for this purpose. fe could not pr vent Kov/eit merchants buyin ; in Persia to sell to bawdi Arabia, but until this source of supply is again available the business must be forgone. The suggestion that the bawii ^rabian wheat quota should be reduced is not a matter now within the control of the Ministry of Food as thj United States is supplying the territory direct, but if the slowness with which East Saadi Arabia took up her previous allocations of wheat is any criterion it is difficult to believe that there is any shortage. In view of all. the circumstances we cpuld not agree to the Political Lesident* s suggestion that we, should supp^ to Koweit an /additional/ fa V'rU Au’ additional 600 tons to make good sales to Saudi arabia. ^ ' :i -' - 0 ^-itioal Resident also suggests that Koweit's monthly quota be increased by 100 tons i,e. from 600 to tons, but apart from the wholly irregular sales to the 3 a®ii Arabians the only justification for this would aopear to be the .alleged increase of 55 tons a month in consumption by the irect employees of the oil company and some unsp .-cifed increase dhe non-employed immigrants from the Trucial Coast, Imports from Persia are stated to have fallen from 300 to less than .^0 tons monthly, but if in turn sales to Candi Arabia are stopped howeit should be about^Q^ tons a month better off for fro' rT. al °f r ^ is , n0t what nuinbers may have emigrated fiom thj xracial Coast to Koweit, but when as recently as the 27th January the Political Resident reported the reduced 1 cquiremonts of the Trucial Coast the reasons advanced Bade no reference to there having been any movement of population to Koweit* In paragraph 7 of his telegram The political Resident re -rs to Koweit having been allocated a monthly ouota of 300 tons of barley when imports of rice from India ceased, but which has never been taken up* ie do not appear to have any record of this allocation, ^but as nee iirports from India probably ceased soon after the oa P s ;Bu - niIa ‘this is not perhaps surprising. For the reason stated above we see no present grounds which would warrant our applying to the I. e.F.C. for any increase in the monthly wheat quota for Koweit, but neither do we consider that any ctxs- has been made which would justify any application for an allocation of 130 tons of barley a month.

Alternatively a deduction to be made from Saudi Arabian wheat quota and added to Ko?/eit quota. /. Koweit was allotted a monthly quota of 300 tons of barley when imports of rice from India ceased but has never drawn it, presumably because of import of non quota cereals, vide para Ij., if the additional wheat asked for in para 6 ( 3 ) cannot be supplied she should be allowed to draw up to half this quota, viz. 150 tons per month.INDEXED KXPRESS L^TTi^R .

Even more surprising are the reasons he advances in support of the application. Reference is made to an increase in the number of employees of the Koweit Oil Company to nearly 6,000, but as our present programme of wheat for the company is 165 tons every two months and we are informed that this represents the requirements of about 5,500 persons it is not apparent wl^y the company^ requirements should be advanced as a reason for increasing the allocation to the Sheikdom.

Dear Dundas, On Wednesday 301133 representatives of the Anglo Iranian (Sri Co., and the Ministry of Fuel and Power the question of wheat supplies. This is likely to be a troublesome matter, but for the time being it has been left that the Chairman of the Company will submit a full statement to the Minister of Fuel who, in turn, will no doubt make representations to the Minister of Food. It did, however, emerge in the course of the conversations referred to above that one of the A.I.O.C. representatives called at the office of the Bas4a Port Director on his way to the United Kingdom on Saturday last and was informed by the Port Director that he also was desirous of obtaining wheat from Ministry stocks and that he had recently paid about £90 per ton for a quantity he had obtained from Kuwait. Obviously I am not in a position to vouch for the accuracy of this statement, but I have no reason to doubt that it is substantially correcU This being so it would seem that while we are supplying Kuwait with wheat at what is relatively a veiy low price, and in quantities which we understand to be sufficient only for the essential requirements of the shiekdom, they in turn are disposing of it at a price which would represent a gross 'profit” of the order of 200 per cent. /As R.

As you are aware ithe Shiekdoms have recently reduced their stated requirements a^id on occasions there has been some delay in up the quarybiti^s programmed* This would seem to suggest that ei^^r the progrkipm^ ;Ls too* generous or that they have had difficulty in finding the money, but in view of the general shortage of food grains in the Middle East it would now seem that the territories in a position to do so are not averse to selling their imported wheat at the very high local prices at present obtainable* A his gives point to a question I have raised from time to time in the past that we have no factual basis on which to assess the real minimum requirements of the shiekdoms. I have always inclined to the opinion that there were fixed during the war years when the overiding consideration was keeping the natives quiet and for that reason they probably have little relationship to present consumption needs, particularly in a time of world shortage. It may also be that during the war years funds were available to the shiekdoms which made it readily possible for them to buy anything which was offered, but these sources of revenue have no doubt diminished, thus accounting for any reductions in off-take^. While I fully appreciate the difficulty obtaining any really reliable statistics of population or of indigenous production I do think it desirable that the Political Resident be asked to confirm that he is fully satisfied that the wheat wa are supplying is not more than sufficient for minimum consumption requirements* In particular I think the Political Resident should be requested to investigate the alleged sale of wheat by Kuwait to the Bastta Port Directorate. In present circumstances it is essential that we should be in a position to justify arrjr of the programnes we are sponsoring* Yours\ sincerely^ D. G* Stewart.

This has meant that the Sheikdoms have been receiving wheat at well below world prices. In future wheat for the Persian Gulf territories will come from Australia at a cost considerably higher than that of the Canadian wheat previously supplied. An increase in the price of wheat supplied to the Sheikdoms is therefore inevitable when the last of the Canadian wheat has been issued from our pool stocks in the Persian Gulf but it is not proposed at present to raise the price beyond the level necessitated by the change in the source of supply. The observations of the Political Resident will be borne in mind when the question of price comes up for further consideration and we shall let you know of any fresh development* The question of price is linked with the wider question of the extent of our responsibility for procuring wheat for the Sheikdoms. Prom the supply point of view. R.I. Hallows, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, 'Jfe&amp;t&amp;hadl, S.W. i /ifif from no other, we should find it very convenient to shed our procurement liability for these territories and I should be grateful if you would let us have your views on this aspect of the matter. « T .. ...

During the war, and up to the end of 1947, the Foreign Liiddle last territories of Iran, Iraq, Transjordan, Syria and Lebanon received I.

Proui January'1948 onwards these countries will have to fend for thenselves, and cover their requirements as best they can in the open .arket. Apart fro.., the Foreign l.idule East territories mentioned above, we have met all require .ents of the I iddle and Far last sugar importing Colonies* This arrangement will probably continue through 1943, although no agreement has yet been reached. •On the particular question you raised of the Persian G-ulf Sheikdoms, those territories obtained the bulk of their sugar supplies pre-war from India and Java, and no doubt Indie was their principal source of supply throughout the war period and since. /Asv As a uatter of interest, we have recently sold small quantities of British refined sugar to Kuwait, and shall no doubt have an opportunity of competing for a share of the Sheikdom's requirements in 1948.

It appeared from Tehran telegram Mo, 104 of 19th April that the purohaae hod been arranged through Gray, IfedKensie &amp; Co,, and that this fins required inde inification against# possible loss *her* no insumnoe ooulct be effooted. The telegram suggested that this was limited to the transport of the rice between Mohmsaer&amp;h and the Sheikhdoms, Tehran suggested that the Government of India might provide the neoeaaary guarantee, but the Govemaent of India had promptly wired su jesting that it would bo more appropriate for Ji,R,3,C, or H^.G, to do so. Telegrams which had previously paa ed between the Political Resident in Tehran but which had only recently been repeated here su vested that the guarantee mi^ht be retpiired to cover a somewhat wider field. * The Foreign Office had already cabled Tehran repeating to India and Basra, asking why insurance could not be effected in the ordinary my and the reply to this query should clarify the issue as to what precisely was required. It was decided in the meantime to enjuire of U.F.C.C., who had been delivering for some considerable time *heat and barley fro,* Basra to the 'heikhdcxAs, what insurance they had been able to effect and how otherwise they had been able to surmount this difficulty. /TehranTehran talegram No*49 of 14th April repeated here on 27th April aa No.820 ahowed that they eere anxioua that thia transaction mkB not oanoelled for lack of the required guarantee aa it aii^it preJudioe future efforts of M.EJ.s.c* to obtain Persian oo^operation in regard to reservaticm of other applies for foreign destinations^ Neither i!r* Wlkely or Mr. J urdain thought that thia Sfgisfi ssyirisi i*ry , uoh weight up as to whether or no the required guarantee should be given. rhe Treasury were not in favour of the transaction aa any purchases by the sterling area frora l ersia would entdil yment aa to 60 in gold; henoa, although they would not oppose the heikhdouaa getting rioe from Persia they were not inclined to take any steps to facilitate it. It was pointed out, however, that there uust always be a certain amount of trade between the Sheikhdoms and Persia and that there oould bu no question of olosing this down on account of the currerwy difficulty. Some discussion took place as to the responsibility for the well being of the Bheikhdoas, whether it lay with H.M.G. or with the Govemnent of India. H.M.G. bad only with great reluctance agreed to pay the subsidy for Iraqi barley shiooed to the Sheikhdoms in 1943A. Atthat mi t£ first suggestion had been that the oost of this subsidy should be / shared betwien H.M.G. and India in the proportion of 45 to &gt;5, a proportion which had been proposed for special war subsidies at the beginning of the war. the Government of India had, ‘ however, pointed out that with famine conditions then prevailing in India it was quite Impossible for them to pay a food subsidy to anyone outside the oountiy. It was felt that if the present case were to Involve a joint guarantee between H.M.G. and the Coveraaent of India this proportion might be suggested as a reasonable basis. Mr. J urdain wished to make it clear that ths M.E.S.C. /wouldr * 4 / would woloorae the proourawent of Permian rice by the Arab iheikhdcias in as ^uoh as this would diminish the j amount of wheat to bo shipped to the n* Us also drew attention to a phrase used in the olitioal Resident's telegram of iprll 16th to Tehran repeated here as telegram ho.821 # in whioh he referred to the refusal of the to undertake the transaction. He asked that when a reply was sent to the Political Resident it should bo mads clear that aa the M.S.3,0. did not possess any funds they were not in a position either to purohaee the rioe or to give the guarantee now required. There was obviously no desire on the part of the M.K.S.C. to sabotage the sohsroe.* ICyPHER TELEGRAM Jo.T.P,) Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Secretary of State for India, Cairo, Government of India and Tehran.

Treasury Ref: S 51550 4th June, 1$45* ^ Dear Nind, Thank you for your letter of 23rd May about the procurement of Persian rice for the Arab Sheikdoms. We have discussed this matter further in the Treasury in the light of the meeting on 18th May and of your letter. I X gather that we have secured a decision that the Sheikdoms were to be supplied in future from overseas, and in the circumstances we cannot allow paragraph 5 of M.E.S.C. Savingram No. 1264 to pass. On the principle of 'de minimis” we have left the Sheik doms free to take some Persian rice at their own expense but we do not feel able to give any facilities, having regard to the appalling price, and the fact which I explained at the meeting, that these purchases involve us in the provision of gold to the extent of 60 $. The suggestion is made that a guarantee by H.M. Government would have such an influence with the Persians as to make it unlikely that the guarantee would be implemented. If the weight and authority of H.M. Government is wtiat is needed, perhaps the Foreign Office might be invited to tell the Persians that on supply grounds the Allies want this rice to go, and to assure the Sheikdoms that they will protest to the Persian Government if it does not go. With such an assurance perhaps the Sheikdoms would themselves be willing to carry the risk. I am sending a copy of this to Wikeley and Jourdain. Yours sincerely. W.W.

Yours sincerely, '»sW niMo t / /I have had a discussion with Gilchrist of U«K.C,C # regarding the difficulties in supplying the Arab Sheikhdoms with Persian rice owing to the guarantee ® daraanded by Gray, MacKenziet &amp; Company. As he sees it the problem may be divided into three parts. 1. The quality of the rice supplied by the Persian Government may not be up to standard and so not acceptable to the Sheikhdoms. Gilchrist suggests that this is a normal .commercial ^risk which should be got over by normal commercial methods, i.e. Gray, MaoKenzie should obtain representative samples from the Persian Government of the ride which they propose to supply. Those samples should be submitted by Gray, MacKenzie to the Sheikhdoms. If the Sheikhdoms agree to the quality Gray, Mackenzie 1 s Tehran representative would draw samples of each delivery as tendered by the Persian Goveramont and compare them with the standard samples. If they are closely in line with the standard sample. Gray MaoKenzie would accept the tender and the Sheikhdoms should be satisfied. If the samples drawn from the tender are inferior then Gray, MacKenzie's contract with the Persian Goverrment should provide for the right of rejection. v 2. Gilchrist finds it hard to believe that Gray,s MaqKenzie cannot find out the coat of railing from Tehran to Korramshar. He realizes that. tliore iaay be difficulty regarding on-carriage to the Sheikhdoms and here he suggests that the Political Resident might agree on behalf of the Sheikhdoms to take delivery at Korrarashar, so that the contract between Gray, MacKenzie and the Sheikhdoms would be f.o.b* Korramshar. Gray, MaoKenzie would be entitled of course to make a small charge for storage at Korramshar, but provided dhows could call for the rice at regular agreed intervals, this charge should not amount to much. /5.s. 3* Tltere may be loss of weight owing to seepage or climatic conditions* Gilchrist suggests that the Sheikhdoms might agree to buy on rail eights as ascertained at Tehran and if so this problsm would be solved. (Otherwise Gray, ^acKenaie would have to add a certain percentage for possible loss in weight between Tehran ani Korramahar. In such oases it is usual to fix a percentage for the first consignment and to adjust it for subsequent consignments in the light of experience* Gilchrist * s opinion generally was that Gray, MacKenzie were making very heavy w at her of this transaction-and suggested that it mi^it be advisable to suggest that some other fin., ouch as Gtrick 6c Company, should handle it* He suggested th&amp;i; in the first place m*. might get in touch with Gray, MaoKenzie * s London office, (122, ieadenhall Street, E.C.3. Telephone No* Avenue i»£80), and ^ee if they could be induced to take a mofe reasonable view of the transaction and cable theii people in Tehran. He thought, however, it would be best to have oui* meeting first and ascertain from the I’olitical Resident his views on the suggestions made in the above note. //- S'-tjqqbjC'ii Jc^ F.O'VU ?2ISZG'Jm fa (/&amp;• ^ Xl [Code R] *V^N 'l 14MAY Ce^Svaxi ff.lo.r-* ‘N DEPARTMENTAL NO. 1 , With To'^ir&gt;firrients FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE Sir R, Bullard.

I would emphasise that this is not a normal commercial transaction because (l) prices must be kept to a minimum owing to the poverty of xhc Persian Gulf Sheikdoms (2) definite information about ; cost of handling and storage at Khorramshahr, the period of transit, and losses caused by summer heat is not available. (3) Persian Government insist on sale terms free on rail Tehran so Gray Mackenzie cannot quote firm prices landed at destination. 3. While Gray Mackenzie are anxious to help they will not accept financial or other liability for unforeseen contingencies which cannot be covered oy insurance. If His Majesty's Government will guarantee to indemnify them against loss Gray Mackenzie would be able to carry through transaction. A quick decision is desirable as prices quoted in my telegram 393 may vary.Ministry of Food, Portraan Court, Portman Square, W.1. 14th February, 1945* Dear Find, I refer to your letter of 12th February to Hollyer. During the years 1937/38 - 1941/42 inclusive, exports of rice from India averaged 254,000 tons, of which 100,000 tons went to Ceylon and, as you write, 72,000 tons to the Arab Sheikdoms and Saudi Arabia. In December 1942 India announced that exports of rice would have to cease and that the 2.IESC would have to assume entire responsibility for supplies to the Arab Sheikdoms, Saudi Arabia and Aden. Inasmuch as before the war Ceylon alone imported about 550,000 tons of rice a year, of which about 450,000 tons came from Burroa, a very formidable problem at once arose. I, nyself, went to Cairo to acquire as much rice as possible from the Egyptian crop and my Assistant Director v/ent to Brazil to buy the exportable surplus of that crop. * While I was in Egypt it was agreed that the rice acquired there should be pooled and allocated against Army demands, requirements for-MESC territories, including Saudi Arabia, the Arab Sheikdoms and Aden, and for Ceylon. The M3SC, who advise the Ministry of Food as to the quantities which they think should be shipped to the territories for which they are responsible, have not, so-far, informed us of any untoward situation in Saudi Arabia or the Arab Sheikdoms resulting from any change in diet necessitated by the reduced quantities of rice which are going there. Until recently it was possible W.W. Kind Esq. , India Office, 4, Central Buildings, Matthew ihrker Street, S.W.1. to/V V to shiji rice to Ceylon at the rate of only 120,000 tons a year which has since been raised to 216,000 tons a year. In consequence the ^population have been obliged to accustom themselves to a diet of other cereals in place of rice. As you are aware'the greatest difficulty is being experienced in maintaining supplies to Ceylon even on the present greatly reduced scale and the demands ,for rice for Mauritius and elsewhere with which the Ministry of Pood is being faced present almost insoluble problems. Responsibility for the supply of rice to Saudi Arabia and the Arab Sheikdoms at present rests with the MSSC, but if the Government of India feel that for political or other reasons it is desirable that this supply should be augmented I fear that unless India herself will consent to resume exports to these territories nothing can oe done to alleviate the situation* I am sending copies of this letter to Hollyer, James of the Treasury and Wikely of the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H.L. Sanderson Director of Rice. iIte. 46-J Britiah Residency &amp; Conaulat«w5eri*ral Buaairt, th« 9tii Junaary» 1945.

Sir, Aa Hi* Majesty** Oovomiaent are awaro very fjyeat hardaliip ha* been caused in the Persian Gulf by a compulsory change of diet frota rice to otlner cereals. This has been the subject of many representations at various times, and the Arab States have been compelled to accept first of all wheat mad barley, than whxte flour and barley, and finally a^ain wheat and barley* During my recent visit to hnwait, Colonel Hokeo»i, who is of course the greatest authority on the Bedouin in these parte, drew attention to the deplorable effect that this unfamiliar diet was having upon them. 2* As his statements were interesting and better informed than Best of those that have come to my notice, and as tie has the advantage of a great familiarity with the domsstic side of Arab life, I asked him through the Political Agent to record these views in a self contained minute so that I could give them a wider circulation. This note is enclosed herewith, and shows very lucidly the extremely unsatisfactory situation that has been brought about by the denial of rice to tide area. Ro.att«apt has been made at any time to provide Egyptian rice, which has been earmarked for rubber workers in Ceylon and Southern India, who apparently have a higher priority than .Arab oil workers in Bahrain, and the export of Indian rice which was available in Sind was forbidden. An arrangement has recently been made which it is lipped will result in making available some Persian rice, though unfortunately at a very high rate, but this will only be within the reach of better paid labour and not the general public. Colonel Dickson's note refers principally to the Bedouin, but it applies, kiout n to a varying extent, to the poorer classes everywhere, with the exception of some Persians and Indians. A sudden change of diet to a race with very limited resources and unfamiliar with culinary experiments must obviously have very serious effects, and I trust that upon the Burmese supplies once again becoming available the unfortunate experiences of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf will be borne in mind and that they will be given a sufficiently high priority to enable them to secure their r ^rament* from their former source of supply at a reasonable rate. 4.

Even the poorest of them could afford to buy a small quantity of the cheap Karachi rice for their modest one meal a day. '*Vheat flour was practically unknown outside the towns. The great advantage of rice was that it was easy to cook and was a meal in itself if other things failed, also it was digestible and in a Badawin household where a stranger might arrive at any houB of the night this counted for much for the lady of the tent could get up and cook him a meal of rice and serve it with a few dates. She never offered bread to the guest. Today the traveller and stranger is not given even ” jerish ,, , the miserable apology of wheat cum bran porridge ( described below) should he arrive by night, as the latter takes too long to cook, so a handful of dates only is given, and a few sips of Arab coffee in the morning before he departs. The above applies to the Badawin of Kuwait and the coastal province of Hasa especially. 4n the deep desert, conditions have always been harder and many Badawin live solely on camels• milk and a few dates, but when there are a succession of lean years, as we have had in East, Central and South Arabia during the second and third years of the present war, many thousands of camels died, and the nomad population had a very hard time in consequence. Indeed death from starvation on a large scale would have been the Bed^s lot had not King Ibn Saud opened soup kitchens in almost every township throughout Nejd. It was during this particular period that Iraq forbade the export of dates, and added immeasurably to the food difficulties of the Badawin both of Kuwait and of North Central Arabia. The few dates which did reach them by underground and other methods cost as much as Rs. 60/- a raaund, a figure entirely beyond the means of the nomad The above generalisation is by the way, and is given for back ground purposes only. 2. When India failed to supply Arabia with rice two years ago, large quantities of wheat began to arrive in Kuwait, under M.E.E.C arrangements for distribution to the inhabitants and for sale to the Badawin of the interior. The M.E.6.C. failed however to take one important factor into consideration, namely that the people of Kuwait and the hinterland were not bread eaters and so had no facilities for turning the wheat into flour, i.e. flour mills ( only one small mill was available : and this was at once taken over by the Shuyukh). \ Moreover there were practically no hand grinding stones in the town, and 75&gt; of the ^adawin could not even produce a diminutive stone grinder.” All the latter could do was to break up the wheat they were able to buy into a coarse flour using their coffee pestles and mortars for the purpose, a long and tedious proceeding. This state of affairs lasted many months until ' Rahas” ( hand grinding stones) began to arrive from Persia for sale to the public. But as these cost Rs. 36/- to Rs. 40/- each, those who wanted them most could not afford to buy. Today there are still far too few ' Rahas * among the Badawin, and as many as 30 tents may have to share one. It is true that on one or two notable occasions the M.E.3.C- 2 - r have with the best of intentions sent a quantity of superb white Australian and Candian flour to Kuwait, but alas its well intent- ioned directors failed to appreciate that only the European with his white bread ideas likes or can use white flour. The local population can only make his flat breads with ” ata 99 or brown flour such as is used in India. The when they did get a flour ration^, were also given a quota of whole barley which they were told to grind and mix with it. 3. As mentioned above vheat crushed in pestle and mortar or ground into flour without the bran removed, was an entirely strange diet for the Bada^in of th© desert, and 9($ of their women folk had no idea how to deal with it. Today in 1944 all that they can do with their home crushed flour, is to make four nauseous dishes: (a) Jerlsh .- A kind of porridge boiled with brackish water in most cases, and with no fat, salt or butter in it. tb) Margu^a - Consisting of large pats of dough of hard consistency, dropped into boiling water and stewed into a kind of soup. This may have a lump or two fat mixed with it if the tent dweller has been able to come by this luxury. (c) Aseeda .- Consisting of flour and crushed date# mixed with^ter and boiled into a kind of gruel. (d) called Bread .- Consisting of thick lumps of dough patted into rounds, and inserted in the ashes of a camel dung fire. When taken out the rounds are burnt black on the outside, but the inside remains fcticky dough. The consequences of all the above forms of wheat flour diet are that nearly every grown up person today complains of worms and stomach trouble but especially of indigestion in its various forms, while all the children are in very poor condition, many with pitiful distended stomachs, like one has seen in pictures of famine stricken areas in China etc. before the war. across Four sample cases which I myself have come ukrxx with my \ wife are given below: V ,&lt;a) During late November, 1944, I visited the tent and family of an Ajman Sheikh whom I have known for some years. His two b^nn^r little boys were in very thin and emaciated condition. Both ******* had swollen stomachs, and they could not digest the wheat porridge (Jerrish) which with a few dates had been their sole diet for yuiiy months. Having just emerged from the long Arabian summer, their few sheep were giving no milk, and they had had nothing in the line of fat for at least seven monihs. The mother pitifully asked how much longer must they exist without rice, as they were alln becoming affected with gastric ailments and acute pains caused by the barley /c husks and bran in their food, nor could she get a seive to separate', the bran from the flour. (Bting to the high cost of 91 ghi ” ( clarified butter ) now selling at anything up to Us. 18/- per 5 lbs, and the impossibility of being able to afford common fat, this poor family appeared to be in a serious state of decline, all were under nourished and obviously lacked every form of vitamin necessary to the human frame. They told me that their one luxury meal, when they could find one, was a spine tailed lizzard cooked in ashes. (b) A woman of the Mutair tribe whom I have known for the past 15 years, is now in a very bud way and I fear that consumption has at last set in. She says she vomits up her food frequently and is no longer able to digest her 99 Jerrish', and Iraqi rice is not obtainable except in the black market and at very high cost ( Hs. 1/- per lb ). Her famafei husband, cnee in the employ of the late : •Faisal of Iraq, earns Hs. 40/- per month which with clothing to think of, does not even allow of his buying his official ration of wheat, (c) A young Badu lad of the Awamir tribe from the distant i)outh of Arabia who had come up to Kuwait in search of better things, and who I met a few days ago, looked particularly poorly. He said he had a bad attack of fever last year, and had not been able to receover sufficiently to eat M ^errish', so his sole diet now was a few dates daily and milk from his camel. (d) A young Mutairi woman with 3 small children and an old mother to support ( she had no husband ) whom we have known for the last three years, we found to be suffering from scurvy due to lack of green | food, and attempting to subsist on nothing by ” Jerrish ' for the last two years. Her limbs ached, her mouth was sore and her legs, arms and face were swollen unnaturally. We were able to help her § and her starving children with a course of lime juice which we had available. The children are skeletons and only money aid from myself is keeping them alive at the present time. ^ One could mention fifty similar cases to the above, tiiich have ^ come under one’s personal notice and it is not an exaggeration to say that in nearly every Badawin tent today, one can find one or two members of the family either sick or slowly dying and more serious still there is very definitely an increase In tuberculosis everywhere in the desert, obviously due to lack of proper food and eating indigestible concoctions made from poor flour* 4. I am of course speaking mainly of the Badawin, with whom I mix a great deal, and not of the townsmen, many of whom are wealthy and can afford luxuries like meat, fish and dehen ( gM ) with their food* ■ From my experience however I can safely say that many of the poorer cAAss townfolk today are als6 in a poor way, and not far removed from the state of the Bacu, due to sheer Inability to find enough money I to buy good nourishing food* Few of the lov/er strata of Kuwait’s society indeed can buy the ration quota allowed them by the authorities' today• . . One might ask (a) how it is that the Badu does not know how to I make bread, also (b) if he ate rice formerly, he must have put fat or butter in it, so why not in his w JerrishThe answer to (a) is that the Badawin is a nomad and cannot cart about a home made oven and so is different to the settled tribes of Iraq and townsfolk in this respect. Nor has he felt the need of grind stories or of ovens, seeing that milk and dates with a modicum of rice has always been his food. To suddenly ask him to manage oh a wheat ration and tell him to make his ov/n bread, is like asking an Englishman to go without meat* The answer to (b) is that rice needs far less fat or butter than properly made •» Jerrish” should have, and if 'ghi' is lacking rice can be cooked with water and still be palatable and nourishing. Dried milk cakes, the 1GT of the desert, can also be used with ££ce* but not with ” Jerrish To sum up- It is abundantly clear that while the desert man is suffering grievously from under nourishment due to the exigencies of war and the difficulty of getting food to hif, his particular problem appears to be the fact that he has been suddenly required to change I his staple diet or rice, for one utterly foroiim fn him. hocmn-e v,,™ been disastrous and stomach troubles du sugar and tea for his wife and five children. improperly cooked bread etc. have made general health of the community and the; malnutrition.-4- 3 The greatly Increased Incidence or Tuberculosis clearly points to this and without a doubt 9 matters would greatly improve if a modicum of rice could once again be imported and doled out to the people* I have purposely not dealt with the hardships vfciich are today been borne by the people both in the desert and among the poor of the town t due to the difficulty of obtaining proper clothing* But as this falls outside the scope of what 1 was us.t.ed to write about 9 I have left it alone* The clothing problem of course goes hand in hand with that of f&amp;od* Bd.

Political,Bahrain. 19 44 % V4 For some time past there have been rumours of smuggling of arms, quota goods and slaves through the Qatar Peninsula. Proof was difficult to obtain and deterrent measures were postponed as they would have prejudiced the negotiations for the settlement of the long standing dispute between the Rulers of Bahrain and Qatar over the question of Zubarah. 2. The Ruler of Qatar was on several occasions warned of these reports by the Political Agent. Bahrain, and asked to take immediate steps $o prevent a position which was illegal and contrary to the interests of his people. From further reports received in October and also from investigations by the Residency Agent, Sharjah, who was deputed to visit Qatar, it became clear that far from co-operating in the prevention of smuggling, the Ruler ( or rather his eldest son and heir, Shaikh Hamad in whose hands power is now mainly centred ) and his relatives were both directly and indirectly encouraging it to their profit. Quota cereals, sugar and piecegoods were being re-exported to Persia and to other ports on the Arab side of the Gulf, and goods imported from India were never landed but sent under fresh manifests to other ports in the Gulf, while the population of Qatar went short. 3. The Ruler of Qatar has therefore been informed that in order to ensure a fair distribution of quota goods to his people a system of rationing under the control of the Political Agency, Bahrain, would be introduced in Qatar, that it is proposed that a representative of the Agency should take up his residence in Qatar and supervise the distribution of goods through a reliable merchant appointed from Bahrain, and finally that no allotment of quota goods would be made to him or his ifcmedlatfc relatives and their families,it being clear from their previous activities that they were amply supplied with {Sigrurtwre) S. 44 .

We considered it Best, however, to allow this reserve to be eaten down in June, lest the flour should deteriortate by being stored too long. We therefore decided to issue no cereals to the Government in June, and we shall build up their stocks again in July. NOTE. 2. The release of 1,695* s- 3 against the monthly quota of 900, added to their existing stocks, will satisfy the needs of the Trucial Coast until the end of August. The one month’s reserve in the territory is therefore assured. 4. iVree stocks held on U.K.C.C. account *n July 1st, May therefore be estimated as follows: Stocks on June 1st, per para. 1 15,740 Wheat 15,170 Flour • 570 TOTAL 15,740 2.

In budgeting for our forward Commitments, we have hitherto borne in mind the possibility of having to come to the help of Persia. Earlier in the year, when prospects were not prom ising in that country for either the wheat'collection scheme, or for the 19Ai harvest, we aimed at stock-piling in the Gulf Area, a reserve for this Persian contingency of 10,000 wheat/flour. We reported to you that we had sold to the Persian Government 3,000 Australian flour from stocks accumulated towards this reserve, and approximately half ©f this parcel has now been delivered. Our latest information all indicates a much sounder position in Persia, and we now consider it- unlikely that the balance of this reserve will be needed.If, however, our estimate of the forward position in para. 7 above is at all correct, this re serve will in fact have been achieved in the course of JUly, and no further stock-piling for this purpose need enter into our calculations, provided the 1944 Persian wheat collect ion scheme opens satisfactorily. - • 9* In view of the satisfactory stock position as estimated in para. 7 we suggest that the next big^hip to be nominated for the Gulf after the CAPE CLEAR should be a late August loader* / Circulation overleaf. ;hxMSSSAGS 121925G CONSIDSNTIAL IN Frsi^: M • I » r *'''Vi •?

If the comparison is based on the 1943 calendar year rather than on exports from 1943 crops repeat 1943 crops which we consider more logical it is pointed out that 155,000 tons of white rice were exported in 1943 to destinations other than Middle Sast (Eastern Territories) and that the bulk of the shipments of barley from Iraq to India were effected before the end of December. 3.

Free stocks of A heat and Flour held on U.K.C.C. account in the Persian Gulf itrea on June 1st are estimated as follows:- Wheat 15,170 Flour 570 Total 15,740 This compares with our former estimated of 17,570 a difference of 1,830. This difference is accounted for by uhe muddle over the • Queenston Heights (see para.2) by arrivals during May being below^ expectations (see para.4) and by adjustments in the May commitments (see para.5). 2. The tanker Que'enston Heights arrived at Bahrein i Apfil with a cango of 227 wheat for the Bahrein Petroleum Company. Hov/ever, the Company already held sufficient stocks for their own requirements, and offered this shipment to the Bahrein Government which accepted it. In consequence of this, the May release to Bahrein had to be reduced by 227. At the same time, it was pointed out by Baghdad to the Bahrein Petroleum C-ompany that private arrangements of this nature created confusion, and tfrat it would’be appreciated if the Company would communicate with M.^.S.C. before taking such action in the future. We may add that as recently ■'as March, the Company wrote to this Centre complaining that they had received no direct shipment of Australian wheat since July 1943 and enlisting our support in urging that tankers should again be nominated for Bahrein. Our reply to the Company was repeated to you as Saving 1823. 3. As a result of the escapade of the Queenston Heights, free stocks held in U.K.C.C. account on May 1st should be amended to read:- Wheat 10,170 Flour 1.830 Total 12.000 4.

He advances the following arguments based on a report by the P.A. Bahrein : a) Lifting capacity by dhow from Bahrein to Dubai may be estimated at 730 (half 1500) tons per month. (Consumption, however, is 1350 half 2700 tons). Nevertheless, delays in transport must be anticipated owing to unexpected calms. The lifting of cereals from Bahrein at f.o.b. rates would „ probably mean that sheikhs of Sharja and Dubai:iwould have to appoint agents in Bahrein with very large funds at their disposal.

The political Resident,Persian Gulf, is consulting with the political Agent at Bahrein with regard to the possibility of maintaining the Trucial Coast on a cash and carry basis by dhow traffic. 2. When the matter was discussed in Cairo recently, the political Resident considered it unlikely that the Trucial Coast possessed sufficient dhows for the purpose and suitable craft would certainly not be available during the four months pearling season. In any event, if the scheme were practicable collection from Bahrein and not Basra would be desirable, and the scheme ahould be applied to barley in the first instance. 3 . Birort- discharge of wheat from ocean-going craft would still be necessary from time to time at the Trucial Coast or Bahrein if back loading from Basra was to be avoided. 4. Maintenance of Bahrein and Muscat by dhow traffic is impossible as those state's do not own suitable craft and the employment of the largo fleet of dhows owned by Koweit for the purpose was impossible as these ocean-going dhows were employed as far afield as the East African coast. 5 .

(Persian Gulf Wheat/frlour position.) 1. The Persian Gulf '..dieat/^lour stock position continued to improve and there was every indication that our planning towards the attainment of a target figure of 28,000 tons (representing three months supply, for Gulf consumers at 6,000 tons per month/an additional^ 10,000 tons against any contingency to be met for Tehrcan) was progressing satisfactorily if the acceptance of the February loader had been possible. 2. Investigations are being made by the P.R.P.G. to determine the maximum amount of storage available at Gulf ports resulting from a new policy agreed ,! by P.R.P.G. and M.E.S.C. whereby ground stocks at all urab Sheikdoms will never J fall below one month’s supply at any time, covered by the diversion incoming j l cargoes as the situation demands. 3. The establishment of these subsidiary stock locations will increase the Gulf storage capacity to an estimated total of over 30,000 tons, allowing sufficient 'margin to permit a long term loading programme to be accepted with out the necessity of deleting loaders from time to time. A, Wheat/Flour stocks in the Gulf are estimated at 21,726 tons on March 1st but the position at April 1st will have deteriorated. This is presuming the February loader due in March to have been deleted and intakes in march will be limited to approximately 1,000 tons (estimated tanker arrivals / against consumption requirements of 6,277 tons. The estimated stock position at April 1st is 16,449 tons, 5 . It is requested therefore that the Gulf be. provided with. a. loading programme of 10,000 tons monthly for the next three months. Against consumption requirements of 18,000 tons over the same period the balance will increase Gulf reserves to the level of our target of 28,000 tons, 6 . If it is finally decided to send forward Australian loaders both in February and March then the estimated stock position at i^pril 1st will oe approximately 23,000 tons and if April shipment is brought up to 10,000-tons the target figure of 28,000 tons will probably be reached anci future shipmento of 7,000 tons per month will suffice. Of course if Teheran does not eventually require the whole 10,000 tons, a proportionate reduction in ..loadings will be possible* . 7 . The January position was improved by a reduction of cereal requirements due to the appearance of undisclosed st ock on the Trucial Coast thus covering arrears (our 180 para, 12 refers.) and to Jeddah’s agreement to the cancellation of 2 500 tons of Y/heat/frlour outstanding'against October/January Programme for East 9 Saudi Arabia (your 164 refers). Certain small quantities of Iraqi Rice are being made avoidable which will reduce Wheat requirements by an equivalent amount. A./To fc 1, , •, ., 6 . Flour’ consumption continues on a reduced scale as the jjrab states are accepting deliveries with extreme reluctance now that V/heat is available. It was originally agreed to issue hlieat and Flour in equal quantities in order to clear the i'lour stocks but experience to date indicates that Wheat will ^ assume the larger proportion in consumption requirements. In order therefore to renuce the Basra rlour stock, negotiotions arc in hand to move a parcel of 3,000 tons into Teheran against the contingency stated in para. 1 , should I ersia succeed in selling their surplus Wheat located at Zabul to India, (The movement of -this ’Theat from Sabul to Teheran would be J extremely costly owing to distance’and lack of transport facilities), 9* Basra Stocks (All in tons.) ....

I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter which I have received fflom His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and to refer to your telegram No. T/l^86 dated the llth December 194i£ addressed to the Middle East Supply CBntre. 2. His Highness has already given his views clearly and concisely and with considerable feeling to Captain Stoner of the Middle East Supply Centre /during an interview which I arranged for Captain Stoner with His Highness. He has now seen fit to record in writing his view that the maintenance of an adequate supply of essential food-stuffs is of para mount iB£&gt;ortance and that the consequences of any serious administrative break-down resulting in a shortage of essential food-stuffs in Bahrain would be disastrous to his prople and to our prestige. b. The correspondence on the subject of the maintenance of supplies of essential food-stuffs, in particular cereals, to the Persian Gulf is voluminous and I do not propose to recapi tulate any part of that correspondence, nor Is it necessary tor me to repeat in detail the events which resulted in there being no cereals available from U.K.C.C. stocks for the Bahrain Islands with a population of 9o,000 persons, a number of whom are engaged in ^essential war work*, on the first of December, 1943. Happily, there was present in Bahrain a quan tity of wheat earmarked for the Saudi Arabian Government by the G.K.C.C. and it was made use of to meet the local crisis and avert disaster. We are assured that steps are being taken to avoid a repetition tff the events of December 1943 and as I have already addressed you officially on the major points raised by His Highness in his letter I do not propose to do more at this stage than to request that His Highness* letter be brought to the notice of the Government of India.

As a result of the recent difficulties which have arisen in the deliveries of wheat and flour to Persian Gulf Sheikdoms, it has been considered advisable to'review the stock position in general and the Sheikdoms in particular. 2. Recent telegrams between P.R.P.G. and M.E.S.C. are self- explanatory regarding the delay in November and December shipments to Gulf consumers and when price and acceptance difficulties were finally settled, further delay was caused by the^vessel undergoing engine repairs. 3. To improve the unsatisfactory position of hand to mouth deliveries which were necessary before receipt of P.R.P.G. 5157 outlining a 5 months’ programme (and hitherto impossible to implement due to reasons in para.2 and also shortage of stocks) the S.S. Caithness originally advised to discharge at Basra was diverted to Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit. (M.E.S.C. Hides 281 repeated M.W.T. London, Saving 5295). 4. Due to lack of port facilities and subsequent delay, the policy of discharging ocean going shipping, except under emergencies, at Muscat, Trucial'Coast and Koweit is realised as being unsound from the view point of quick turn-rounds. . 5. Future procedure will be diversions to Bahrein only and fadequate supplies of wheat/flour and barley maintained at this J port in addition to Basra stock. 6. In view of the recent confirmation that dhow, traffic is now considered satisfactory, the remaining Sheikdoms will be * supplied whenever possible by this means, if this can T5e Jlfthged (M.E.S.C/Tel.2 to P.R.P.G.)

To avoid flour deterioration resulting from stationary . . stocks due to reduced current demands by PAIC (M.E.S.C. 4917) and future direct shipments of wheat as proposed in para.5, the balance of flour at Basra after ear-marking sufficient for , ^ present A.I.O.C. and future P.

There were present Mr. Peel in the Chair, Messrs. Jourdain and Edwards (M.W.T.) Miss Hobley and Messrs. Scouler and Parsons (Ministry of Pood), Messrs. (Gilchrist and James (U.K.C.C.) and Messrs. Kind, Harrison &amp; Blair (India Office). Mr. Peel emphasised s, the political importance of keeping the inhabitants of the Sheikhdoms contented owing to their position across the lines of cable and air communications and in virtue of the oil which was being produced at Bahrein. 9 * J m Dates The Ministry of Pood admitted tlxat their scheme for purchasing Basra dates through Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Company had not, up to date, produced the results which they had hoped. Grov/ers were holding back frpm supplying dates at the prices offered and their contract with Andrew Weir only related to dates which could be obtained at this price. As a result instead of the full amount of 90,000 tons for which they had hoped, they had only so far been able to deliver 2 , 2,795 tons of boxei. datej and 17,215 of basket dates. It was admitted that the deliveries to Hie Sheikhdoms had been very small and the Ministiy of Pood undertook to send instructions to give priority of shipment to the Sheikhdoms to make up the existing deficiency. It was suggested that one cause of the small shipments might iiave been the failure of merchants to produce dhows and their insistence on some particular variety. Attention to this had recently been drawn in an M.B.S.C, Savingram (No. 191 Misc.). They, were emphatic tliat the prices charged by Andrew Weir had in no case exceeded the prices which had been previously intimated to the Political Resident. They were equally emphatic tliat Weir’s were not charging 60 per cent, commission but that the difference between their purchasing and selling price was legitimately covered by the cost of packing and transport. Attention was drawn to the fact that the M.B.S.C. had alleged that exports of Basra dates to the Sheikhdoms in previous years had been insignificant and in consequence they were unable to understand the Political Resident’s grievance that he had not been allocated the full extent of the quota for/Cereals for which he Iiad asked. i.he U.K.C.C. pointed out tliat they iiad no interest in the date business beyond handling the Ministry of pood’s date allocation to Russia. * * ■ 9 /? It was decided to .draft a telegram to the Political Resident and get it agreed by the Ministry of Pood. — . ^ v;as agreed that tiiere Iiad been an unfortunate misunderstanding regarding the .price of Iraqi barley. The b.K.C.C. assured the meeting tliat no shipment Iiad been held up on this account. Doctor Hurray thought that the Political Resident was not always very sure of his facts before making his complaints. His telegram No. 39 which had just been received illustrated this point. stated that two vessels with some 15,000 tons of wheat had just discharged at Bahrein and that in consequence there was no fear of a shortage for the present. They considered it-practically certain that future shipments would consist 0 ^ wheat and not flour. They agreed to address the Foreign Office on the subject of Astern Saudi Arabia not taking any Iraqi barley as it was T&amp;ained tliat this discrimination against tne Sneikndoras would be wholly resented by them ihe U.h.C.C. asked that it should be brought to the notice of tne Political Resident that they were not responsible for planning supplies but had merely to carry, out the programme which K.E.S.C. drew. up. . . . As regards shipment of wheat by tankers M.W.T. pointed out that the 2 conditions laid down originally to govern such supplies* must continue to be adhere d to viz: — (i) that the loading and discliarge of wheat must not cause undue delay to tankers, . exigencies of the oil situation must have first Cla ^ m iJ :in . S ^ leCting the port discll a r &amp;e £L.e.* either Abadan or Bahrein;. It was hoped to load a tanker for Bahrein towards the end of the Present month hut condition (ii) a hove might cause it to be diverted/|M. 213. ISkiFT TELEGRAEi. CYPHER O.T e P.

Your paragraph No,3. Political Agent is being instructed accordingly. ;Difficulties met with in supply by M.E.S.C. of Cereals to Arab States in Persian Gulf 1232 ) Since the Government of India had to give up early in 1%-3 the supply of cereals to the States difficulties have arisen under three main heads 1. Uncertainty of supplies arriving to time. 2. Quality of supplies. 3. Price of supplies. The political Resident's telegram No* 2438 of 24-th December gives the latest illustration of point 1. The supplies for December consumption due in November are reported to be not arriving until the first week of January. The M.E.S.C. telegram No. 623 to which reference is made by the P.R. has only just arrived here by mail. It reports that a 'technical loading hitch' has prevented a vessel leaving Basra and necessitated the fixing of a later steamer. In his telegram the P.R. blames M.E.S.C. for the existing scarcity of supplies and says it is due to the fact that they would insist on assurances that the consignments would be taken up and paid for. It is difficult to understand why such an assurance should have been considered necessary. One would have thought that the M.E.S.C. would have been making supplies in accordance with a programme put forward by the P.R., and in that case there would surely have been no doubt but that the quantity would have been accepted. The business arrangements made by the P.R. and reported to Cairo in his telegram No. 355 of 10th February should have been sufficient to ensure that there was no failure to pay. I can, However, find nowhere in our papers that the P.R. ever did give a firm monthly programme, though he • was asked to do so by M.E.S.C. in their telegram No. 43 Mides of 27th February. The M.E.S.C. were told by M.W.T. on information supplied by us that the amounts hitherto supplied to the States by India were 3 &gt;500 tons of rice and 1,000 tons of wheat and flour. Apart from supplies from India up to the early part of 1943* Bahrein had arranged occasional supplies of wheat from Australia in returning tankers. This supply was arranged by the Bahrein Petroleum Company/ /X Company through their Agents in Sydney and with the concurrence of M.W.T. The P.R. in his telegram No. 2438 of 20th December has pointed out that no such cargo has arrived since July 1943 and has asked that immediate action should be taken to revive them. We have asked M.W.T. to look into this. QUALITY OP SUPPLIES Prom the very start of the M.E.S.C.'s arrangements it was found impossible to supply the States with rice. Attempts to obtain rice from Iraq failed and what rice that could be obtained from Egypthad to be diverted elsewhere principally Ceylon. This though undoubtedly unpopular seems to have been accepted in good grace and the chief complaint on the score of quality seems to have been directed against the Iraqi barley which has been sent to the States to adulterate the wheat flour. The necessity for this was mainly due to the shortage of wheat supplies in the Gulf, but I find in Savingram Hides 54 of 9th June M.E.S.C. J state that barley and millet from Iraq were originally provided to meet the P.R.’s complaint that flour alone was unsuitable for the Arab States and that a proportion of roughage nmst be provided either in the form of wheat in grain or as barley and millet. * ' ' ’ However that may be, the P.R. has consistently objected to the supply of barley which he describes in his telegram T.1200 of 26th November as being formerly sold for pig food. In his telegram No. f284 of 3rd June the P.R. complained that Saudi Arabia was better treated than the States in this respect, and from a recent Savingram from the M.E.S.C. (No. 5110 of 21st December) it appears that Eastern Saudi Arabia, has refused point blank to take the barley and that the M.S.S.C. have agreed to a tempora ry compromise whereby We ster n Saud i J Arabia takes more than its shared They fear, - however, T^liaTf this * ^ compromise may raise difficulties with the Arab States and have asked for^definite directive in the matter. I have told M.W.T. that we feel very strongly that the M.E.S.C. should be asked to abandon the compromise solution. . . .... PRICE The P.R. objected in his telegram No. 1284 of 3rd June to the exorbitant price demanded for the Iraqi barley, the price of which he contrasted with that of the far more palAtable Indian wheat. He asked that the barley might be sold to the States at the price of Indian wheat, the difference being met by H.M.G. He was supported in this request by both the Government of India and the Minister of State/State, Cairo. The Treasury have not yet given their decision in the matter, but pending it they have instructed the U.E.C.C. to deliver the barley at the price recommended by the P.R. It would seem that these instructions were not Tor sometime being carried out by the U.K.C.C. local people and this caused, not unnaturally, a lot of heart-burning. In his telegram No» 2422 of* 17th December, the P.R. talks of the price of cereals as a whole having been raised and in his telegram No. 2438 of 20th December about the tanker shipments of Australian wheat he mentions its 'reasonable price.' This suggests that the price at which wheat is now being supplied by M.S.S.C. is higher than that of Australian wheat. We know nothing about this and this is the first time that we have received any complaint on the score Oj. price about any cereal now being supplied, apart from Iraqi barley.As I informed you by telephone I have arranged with M.W.f. to bring Mr. Murray to the India Office r on Friday at ll.am., to discuss this question of the supply of cereals to the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms. They are also arranging for a representative of U.A-.C• Cwho actually handle# cereals in the Gulf f to be present. 7 $ fr I have asied k.W.T. to let me have a statement showing the programme of supplies and the way in which it has been implemented, as it is difficult if not impossible to obtain any such clear statement from the telegrams which we have on our file. They have promised to do what they can, but are somewhat doubtful as to whether they themselves have all the necessary material. They hope to have their statement ready for our meeting on Friday. As regards the payment of a subsidy by H.M.G. for the highly priced Iraqi barley which is being supplied to the Sheikhdoms as a portion of their cereal requirements, we have not yet heard from the Treasury. We have asked, at the instance of the Politcal Resident, that the subsidy should apply to supplies to all the Sheikhdoms equally. His reasons for this are given in his telegram T/12Q0 and we have passed this on to the Treasury in my letter to James E.&amp; 0.19331/43 of 9th December. as regards dates I have had a talk with the Ministry of Food and at their request have sent them a copy of the Political Resident's telegram. It will be as well to take the opportunity of Friday's meeting to discuss this also with Murray, and the Ministry of Food have promised to send a representative to it. They will try and get the comments of their Dried Fruits Division before then. I have also sent a copy to M.W.T.

PeatPlease see the Government of India's telegrams and 11599 and the Secretary of State's noting on 11579. Until the end of 1942, the responsibility for supplying the cereal requirements of the Persian G-ulf Shaikhdoms rested with the Government of India. In December of that year however the food situation became so critical in India that the Government of India said that they could no longer undertake supply, and the responsibility was accordingly transferred to the only other alternative source, the kiddle Dast Supply Centre. The ^.D.S.C. work through the U.K.C.C. who make local arrangements, but recently for various reasons, deliveries to the Shaikhdoms have been very unsatisfactory with the result that stocks have been reduced fax below the safety limit and hardships appear to have ensued. It is to be noted in the first place that the quality of the food stuffs is much below pre-war level - apparently no rice at all is now being supplied although it has been a major item of diet for generations, and wheat is being,to the extent of 30;4, replaced by Iraqi millet and barley which the Political Resident said was sold before the war at £2 a ton for pig food. A further difficulty lias arisen over the price of these Iraqi cereals. Their cost price to the U.K.G.C. on delivery amounts to iGpS - £41 a ton as against the £25 a ton which the Shaikhdoms were formerly accustomed to pay for the much better quality Indian wheat. As a result of this it was impossible for the U.K.C.C. to dispose of a shipment in May at £41 per ton except in the case of Kuwait who paid only under the threat of starvation. As regards the other otates, U.K.C.C. v/ere eventually co pelled to dispose of it at £24.10s. a ton and agreed to bear the ensuing loss. The question of a subsidy by H.L,G-. to enable the Sriaikhdoms to receive cereals at £ 24 . 10 s. a ton is at present under consideration, and meanwhile the Shaikhdoms are receiving cereals at the lower price. The Political Resident is strongly of the opinion that the subsidy should be paid by H.M.G-. in the case of all the Shahkhdoms (the Government of Inuia have said that for obvious political reasons they are unable to contribute to it from Indian revenues;, and we are pressing this view, on the Treasury. More recently, an acute situation has arisen owing to delay in the arrival of further shipments to the Shaikhdoras. It is not clear here 7/hat the reason for this delay has been, but it seems that the trouble .aay have been caused by the U.K.C.C. continuing to ask for an undertaking by the Political Resident that the shipments would be paid for promptly on arrival at the higher price of £41 per ton, although it lias in fact , been ©.greed that they should be delivered at the lower price of £ 24 . 10 s. , the balance being made up later to U.K.C.C. by H.M.G-. At any rate it is clear that a certain amount of misunderstanding has arisen resulting in the Shaikhdoms going short of food. The suggestion in Mr. Caroe's telegram No. 11579 that the Political Resident should go to Cairo to discuss the question with M.G.S.C. has much to commend it, and we have in fact recently been emphasising to the Ministry of 'war Transport the need for closer personal contact on this matter. On putting it, however, to the Ministry of War Transport the latter have replied that though they would in normal circumstances have supported the idea, it so hap ^ens that Mr. Murray, the Pood Controller of the M.D.S.C. is on the point of arriving in this country, and that in his absence it v/ould be of little use for Sir G-. Prior to visit Cairo. The M.W.T. 7/ould therefore propose to discuss the matter with Mr. Murray on his arrival and with U.K.C.C. and then arrange a meeting with us which Mr. Murray could attend. i In the circumstances it may be considered unnecessary for the Secretary of State to see Mr. Casey specially on this issue but if he does so it is suggested that the Secretary of State might impress upon him the importance of keeping the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms adequately supplied^/supplied with food in view of their importance as oil production centres and their situation on the air route between dgypt and the Eastern theatre of war. (in this connection the latest development is that the Americans are planning an ambitious programme^for transport of aircraft to India with stopxDing places at Bahrein and Sharjah). It is essential to keep the local population well supplied with. iood and in a contented frame of mind not only from the point oi view oi avoiding unrest throughout the Sheikhdoms generally out also in securing the manri-mum output from the considerable numbers employed on work directly affecting the war effort, such as oil production and labour on air fields etc. This applies particularly to the case of Bahrein where there is ooth an important aerodrome and an oil refinery and oil wells. A reply to the G-overnment of India is submitted.

It is as you will see a demi-official telegram from the Seoretaxy to the Government of India, External Affairs Department to the Secretary of our External Department • In xqy two recent letters of 21st and 29th December on this subject I stressed the importance of more personal contact between the political authorities in the Gulf and the local representatives of M.E.S.C. and U.K.C.C. The Government of India have now suggested on their own that Sir Geoffrey Prior, the Political resident in the Gulf should go to Cairo in order to put matters on a better footing. We are most anxious to support this suggestion and if your Ministry agrees will send instructions to Sir Geoffrey Prior to this effect. We think in addition it would be advisable for you to wire Cairo siiaultaneousHy informing the M.E.S.C. that Prior is coming and stressing the imvx&gt;rtanoe which His Majesty t s Government attach to the effecting of the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms as important centres of oil production, and in view of their situat ion on the air route between Egypt and the Eastern theatre of war. In this connect ion we understand that the latest development is that the Americans ?ire planning an ambitious progranrae for transport of aircraft to India with stopping places at Bahrein and Sharjah. You were good enough to say that you would see Nicholson in this connection find obtain his views on the matter.

V* 29th Itecamber, 1943 * Dear Edwards, In continuation of rny letter No. 19722 of 21st December about the supply of cereals to the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms, I enclose herewith a copy of a telegram addressed by the Political Resident to Cairo and repeated liere. In view of the letter from Cairo to the R&gt;litioal Resident, which formed an accompaniment to your letter of 14th December and which seemed to promise a better state of affairs in this matter than had existed before, it is distinctly disquieting to find the Political Resident stating in this present telegram dated 24 th December 'deliveries tint should have been made to these states before end of November for December consumption will not arrive at destinations before the first week of January' and 'Koweit and Trucial Coast have been reduced to semi starvation'. It is impossible, of course, to Judge from this end what has gone wrong and doubtless Cairo's reply will disclose this but the very fact that all is not yet well lays emphasis on the need for more personal, contacts to which I alluded in my letter to you of 21st December. If anything can be done from tills end to bring about a better co-operation between the Political Authorities and the local representatives of Ji.E.S.C. and U.K.C.C., I trust that it will be done.

In ry reply of 11th Septeniber to Hind (K.A 0# 1660^43 of 27th August) X suggested that the cost of a^y future subsidy found necessaiy, might be sliared between the U.K. Government and the Government of India in the proportion 45s 55# but as reported in Hind* s K.&amp; 0.177V43 of 9th October, the Government of India found thiameelves by political reasons unable to accept any share of the subsidy* . . . * .

In his letter of 19th November (copy attached) Shervrood seta out in greater detail the difficulties in which the Foreign Office ould be placed as a ^defender of the subsidy* There seem to be three potential parents for this subsidy (viz* Foreign Office, India Office and Ministry of War Transport) and it is/ F.E.Grist, Esq., C.I.E., India Office*f*. ■ X is probable that no on© of these Departments would be able to defend a subsidy without support and assistance from the other two. We should be veiy reluctant to ask Ministry of War Transport to take this on since such action would appear to conflict with the policy agreed at tine inter-Departraental Meeting of 17th September and expressed in M. W.T. SavingraiTi No. A# 2178 of 25th September, namely that subsidies should not be deemed to flow automatically from M.K.S.C. policy, but should ' be paid only to such territories as had insufficient resources to pay for high-priced locally-produced grains allotted to them under M.N.S.G. programmes. I am bound to say that^ after reading Sherwood* s letter of 19th November, I am increased with the difficulties in which the Foreign Office would be placed and I, therefore, feel bound to ask you to consider whether the India Office would be prepared to accept responsibility. The main grounds on which I suggest the India Office are these: . (1) Jourdain (IS.W.T.) tells me timt, althohgli M.W.T. would testify that cereals were allotted to the Arab States in accordance with M.K.S.C. j)rogranmes, the M.E.S.C. have no representative in the States and the prognu anes are, therefore, necessarily based on information supplied by the.folitioal Resident and the Gov?xnraent of India. (2) The India Office would speak with most conviction as to the inability in present ciixuiastances of the Govemvent a€ India to share a subsidy. (&gt;) The India Office alone i-ave a local agent (the Political Resident) can watch the local administration, distribution, etc., of the subsidy. X^endiiig the I’eceipt of a reply to India Office telegram No*2^532 of 23 rd October to the oil tic &amp;1 Resident, the ^xole question o ff ’ a acfljBidy is, of course, ir. suspense, but as it appears inevitable that some subsidy will be required, we are anxious to clear up as f«r as possible the question of fiiia«iei«l. and accounting responsibility and I should, therefore, be grateful if you would let me have the India., Office views at your early convenience. I am sending a copy of this to Sherwood, Foreign Office and Jourdain, Ministry of War Transport* Tears sincerely, ( Sd .} R. L. M. J ame s. C *Zb?-) s y* %££ ' 1 POaKIOK OFPBT', 3.W.1. 19th November* 194-3* (15 6^)1/933/91) Dear 3earns 9 As arranged by telephone* I ara sending you the following oaicicnts on the position of the Foreign Ofiiae if called upon to account for subsidies in eoimexion with the supply of cereals to the Arab ilheikhdoisir. in the’ Persian Gulf. ^ v 'f ' ' t 2* The proposal arises out of various happenings viz* the shorta^;e in India which stopped exports to the area* the steps taken by the TJnited Kingdom Coemerolsl Oor\;,oraticn directed by the .Middle 15ast supply Centre to fill the gap* the hi gh purchase price of supplies thus sent* and shipping problems wj ich nppare: tly caused the dive rsion of such cheap wheat as India was able to spare. 3* The Foreign Office had no share in these arrangcsie nt a * and It would be improper* I think, for ua to carment on them, adversely or otherwise. All we oral say in defence of subsidies is that the position necessitating theci app-ara to have been alr&lt; ady reached before the Foreign Office was invited to provide and defend them} and in general that we* in oormon with other depart*;ier.ts of His ^ajenty* s Government * x'egaru the Persian Gulf as an area in which it is important that peace should reign. If, as seems possible, this would not be considered adequate, the Mini a try of War Transport and In ia Office would presumably be asked to put up a defence of the arrangements in detail. k. Azvisaing that a need for subsidies will be established aa a result of the report now awaited in reply to Tndia Office telegram to the Political Resident* Persian Gulf, No. 24.352 of the 23rd October * further points arise as outlined in my letter to you of the 4th October. Vs would make no difficulty, if th© Treasury concurred, in accepting, without shipping doc .fcyents in detail, the oei’tificate of the United Kingdom Ooienorcial Corporation that by dir otion of the Kiddle ;5ast Supply Centre so maiy tons of cereals had been delivered to such arid such Stated at a loss per ton of X£; but the Foreign Office is not and cannot be in possession of Independent inforraaticn whether the tonnage shipped was the minimum necessary in the oircunstancea; or whether the buying price was the lowest and the /selling R.L.1 • Jacws, ^sq** Treasury.(Sgd* ) L.R. 3FTOTOOD* selling price the highest which could he obtained; or whether proper control is exerted over marketing and distribution within the States so as to obviate irregularities, e.g* resale outside their borders, or holding up distribution in search of traders* profits* There being no officers of our own on the spot, it is clear that the necessary information and control can be provided only by the Ministry of War Transport and India Office, and that the Foreign Office is ^sot in a position to criticise what they do or say. 5. If, as I hope, the foregoing is a true picture, the Foreign Office seems to be badly placed as defender of the subsidies; but should there be no other channel by which the charges can pass to the Vote of Credit we should not object to the use of the Diplomatic and Consular Services Account, on the understanding that our limited interest as outlined above is made clear. We feel bound to make this stipulation at the outset in order to avoid possible misunderstandings later on as to the extent of Foreign Office responsibility in the matter. 6» I have not yet made contact with Nind or Jour dam since I do not know what is custcenary in a case of this kind, whei&gt;: a 'b' service involves accounting by more than one department, and because until now the Treasury has been corresponding direct with those concerned. If custym decrees that explanation of the charge is the duty of the Foreign Office we would ask for the necessary information; but as I have said we can do no more than pass on what we are told* ^ p Yours sincerely,COPY (13. 549^983/51) 4th Ootober, 1943« Dear James, Your F*1 7343/03/5 of the 11th September to Nind, about cereals for the Arab States. ^ ' The Foreign Office would be willing to testify to the importance, as an act of Imperial policy, of providing the food, and to that extent would defend a .subsidy for the purpose. But before agreeing actually to bearing the cost we should like to know rather more of the duties which that would entail. Should we, for instance, be expected to take final responsibility as to quantities, qualities and the rate of supply; sources of purchases; and, particularly, measures to ensure that the best possible prices are obtained for sales? In short, are we to exort prior control over the operations in detail of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation? These responsibilities, as well as the production of detailed accounts in support of charges to the Vote of Credit, presumably as a n b* service, seem to be inseparable from the acceptance of charges, and we should be reluctant to undertake them without being in a position to satisfy the proper requirements of the Public Accounts Committee. There may be difficulty over this since up till no?/ the principals engaged in the scheme appear to be the Middle ast Supply Centre, the Government of India and the India Office. Alternatively*, would the Treasury concur in payment being utade in the form of subsidies direct to the States concerned, as in the case of Saudi Arabia; not accounted for in detail but charged as simple amounts agreed apon as the result of periodical reports by the authorities actually concerned with the operations? I should be grateful for your views arid am sorry to raise these perplexing questions; but I think you will agree that we must avoid /the R.L.M. James, Fsq., Treasury.i a 1933VW Copy sent to:- U. K.

Fact is that State only did so under threat of starvation and has boon fighting for a refund ever since. We have .lust had threat repeated by ILK ,R C, , to which I take strongest exception. After reducing supplies to starvation point through their incompetence they have again asked us to accept greatly increased rates at pistol point, (? I do not) know why these loyal and helpful States should be victimised in this way. 5. I (? see) it is also suggested that Saudi Arabia will in future be placed on the same footing as these States. The favoured treatment given to this State who are not apparently expected to accept Iraqi barley (formerly sold for pig food at £2 a ton) is certainly a very sore point here. So far as 1 am aware however Ibn Saul's payments for supplies a e only a (? paper transaction as cost is debited against his subsidies. bxcrept for small payment to Muscat for 'omission) purpose our* States received no subsidy whatever. 6. Question whether subsidy should be paid to Sheikhs or cereals supplied a' reduce r iotf easy one and whatever is done Bahrain, will soon realise they are paying more than others. Since however we cannot guarantee British Political Agent on Trucial CoAst or even Muscat and KTowait throughout the year and also since large sums are involved I recommend that payment should be in form of cheaper grain rather than direct, subsidy to sheikh* and that it should be supplied to all States without exception.I 943 S3CSHET i oi'Gen to Hi, &amp; *• • - — CORRECTION Telegram from Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Tehran repeated to Govt« of India and India Office No.T/12QQ dated 2Sth November 194-3.

In accordance with this policy R.M.G. would be glad to have your viewe on ability of each Sheikhdom to pay subsidy involved in selling Iraqi barley at price recommended by you in your teiegrau lio4 of 3rd June. 2.

As it is proposed m future to treat Saudi Arabia on same level as Sheikhdom* in this respect (see 94^ jiast : S(.iijd repeated to you aa r?o»l ir*aat) this consideration will no longer apply.

I write with reference to Mast Mides No. 1232 regarding Iraqi barley for the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf and in particular to the figures given in paragraph 3 showing the extent of the monthly subsidy which will be necessary from 1st October. Mention is made there of amounts of barley required for Bahrein, Trucial Coast and Muscat but not for Koweit. This may be because at the time that original shipment of barley was made Koweit did not refuse to pay for it as did the other Sheikhdoms (see paragraph 4(h) of Mast Mides No. 1058 of 27th July) and M.E.S.C. are assuming that Koweit will continue to pay the high price without demur. I think you/. E.D.

The following important changes have ree ntly occurred in the Iraqi Barley position*- (a) Increases have been notified in the requirements of Barley for Palestine and Cyprus due to poor harvests, and Govern ment of India has finally confirmed that it is not able to maintain regular supplies of Cereals to the n.rab States. (b) F. Ou telegram 2616 notifies a requirement of 100,000 tons Iraqi Barley for delivery to India as soon as possible, startin g it is s ugg sted in Hovembor 1943. ( c) The Iraqi Government in their notification Ho. 28 of 19 Aug. 43 have declared a free market under certain conditions for all Barley in emcc os of the first one third of each cultivator’s assessment ..Iready due to be sold to the Government or their nominees under earlier legislation. ^(This ’’first one ohird” is expected to provide about 200,000 tons). 2. Meetings have been held In Cairo to examine the position arising from these changes eotween MESO, UKCC MEBOD, chief Representative IjKCC Iraq. By agreement with H.M. Embassy,Bagdad Messrs Murchison and Morris the heads of Andrew Weir and African I: Eastern respectively in Iraq also came to those meetings. The present telegram summarises the discussions. 3. The demand picture as it now stands is contained.in schedule attached. With reference to this target programme, the following points should bo noted especially:- (a) Provision of 20,000 tons for AT3 represents merely an initial stock and in no way exhausts the commitment. Far estimate of to tat ATB grain requirement soe Q. 5 signal from Mideast .to 1 Troopers dated 16 Aug. 43 reference follows.

The present programme is therefore based on the assumption them one-third of tho Arab States ^monthly requirement will bo supplied in tho form of 1 Barley/Millet, although a solution of tho price difficulty ; still romains to do workod out, (c) Including the Contingency Reserve as well as the Existing Commitments, the target is to attain an average turnover in Clean Barley of about 30,000 tons monthly over the next twleve months. 3HT/. 4/. • • • •WARNING : This is an unparaphrased version of a secret cypher or confidential code message, and the text must first be paraphrased* if it is essential to communicate it to persons outside British or Allied Government Services. (*NOTEi Messages shown as having been sent in a One-Time Pad (“ O.T.P.”) are excepted from this rule. 3135 SAVI NG (She, t 2.) 4*- Tho export opinion c.t the meetings recently held (confirmed provisionally from the other authorities concerned in Bagdad)is that, provided adequate supplies of Dirty Barley ere forthcoming promptly, internal transportation and cleaning at the projected rate is not an impossibility, although it will clearly require a high level of organization and greatly exceeds anythinh ach ieved in practice last season. In this connection it would be apprec iated if the Foreign Office and The India Office co-uld be invited to consult the War Office and agree a directive to be issued to C. in C. Paiforce instructing him that the internal movement of this Barley should receive the maximum priority compatible with other war purposes, and for similar instructions to be issued to MWT Basra. No doubt you will also now take any necessary action vis-a-vis WSA as proposed in your Mast Esmid 733 to obtain agreement in principle to allocations when necessary of LIBERTY ships but leaving actual nominations to be decided, on application by HESC to MWT and WSA locally, in the light of st cks available at Basra from time to time andthe general port position bith in P. G-. and Red Sea. 5. The main problem dealt with in Cairo meetings has however been the question of what are the best methods and policy in regard to tho acquisi tlon for account of H. M. G-. of the increased quantities of Iraqi Barley now seen to be needed, and in particular what action if any should be taken on our side in respect of Notification No. 28. 6 . The first point of importance in the approach to this problem is the fact that, in respect of the first one-third of every cultivator’s assessment of Barley legally; due to be sold to the Iraq Government or their nominees, the Iraqi Government is at present under an obligation to pay not lc ter than 30 Nov 43 85^ : o of the value of any such Barley not uplifted at that date. This' represents a considerable financial 'and admin is tra ti&gt;-r liability to the Iraq Government, the exact measure of which is moreover uncertain, since it depends on the rate at which the Agents of H. M, G. are in fact able to take over Barley in the first one-third category between now and the end of November, 7. So long as independent dealings in the remainder of the’ Barley were prohibited, the prospect of their liability on the first one third weighed all the more heavily on the Iraqi Government. By legalising independent dealings in the excess Barley, a safety-valve is created through which pressure from the cultivators can if necessary be allowed to escape. 8 . From our point of view the possible dangers of independent dealings in the excess Barley are the femilar ones, namely the possibility that substantial quantities of such Barley would ne cornered now wi th a view to-holding us to ransom later, and the additional possibility that permission for free dealings, by facilitating the development of a black market, might result in Barley even in the first one third category not being tendered to us but diverted to the black market instead. These possibilities are likely to be stimulated by knowledge of the Cereals shortage in ILndia as soon as this becomes widely known in Iraq, and by forecasts of increased grain demands for Supplying liberated territories in Europe. On the other hand, the representatives from Iraq in the recent meetings urged that these dangers should not be over-estimated since they are likely in practice to be offset by (a) our close control of the available RHT/. internalWARNING : This is an unparaphrased version of a secret cypher or confidential code message, and the text must first be paraphrased* if it is essential to communicate it to persons outside British or Allied Government Services. 8 ( CiD t&gt; j(*KlQTBl Messages shown as having been sent in a One-Time Pad (“ O.T.P.”) are excepted from this rule.) internal transport facilities (b- lack of capital for speculators to corner really larpe quantities of Barley for long holdonc (c) belief of speculators that the Iraq Government is not likely to qrant exfrt licences to others than the Aycnts of H. 1. G. 9* '.Yhether the dangers associaicd with independent dealings are great pr small, it was agreed that two main courses of action arc open to H. M. G. ’it the present juncture:- (a) to reveal to the Iraqi Government the fact that we are prepared to take*on suitable terms the whole exportable Surplus of Iraqi Barley in 1943/44 (es tima tod at between 300,000 and 400,000 tons), and to enlist tthe Iraqi Gocernment as an Allied Nation to aid us by every means in their power to get hold of this surplus. ' If we were prepared to reveal this fact, it would probably be fairly easy to negotiate some form of announcement which would in effect relieve the Iraqi Government of the burden of their present liability to the cultivators, while at the same time making it poliyically possible for them to re introduce the formal prohibition of independent dealings. •(b) To conceal for the time being the fact that we have now become interested in the whole of the Iraqi surplus, but to endeavour to persuade the Iraqi Government not to apply extensive!# the rpovisions of Notification No. 28, In order to secure their agreement on this point, wo should.be prepared to undertake specific action £o assist them in dealing with the problem of payments to cultivator 'J 0 * _ Based ^ on ^experience elsewhere in the Mi. die East, MESC was initially inclined to favour alternative (a) in the present case. The bagdad representatives however strongly emphasised the dis- advantages of showing our hand.. This, they urged, might cause the market to harden and lessen cultivators( willingness to tender even thu first one-third of their Barley, and by revealing our full demand to tho Iraqi Govern non t would put the latter in a, good position to take advantage of us should they so disposed. At the same time as noted above the Bagdad representatives pointed out that the dangers of permission for free dealings might not be so great as supposed.' Both sides in any case agreed that if a way could be found of getting Notification No. 28 nullified in practice without revealing the full extent of our demand, this might well be the most prudent' course to follow. 12. It was particularly brought out that the rate at which Barley in the first one-third category is at present being taken over is limited by the fact that the firms acting as agents of UKCC are handicapped by insufficient finance and by the consideration that as private forms they are not able properly to take upon themselves more than a certain degree of risk even though the wider interests of H, M. G. might make this advisable. The agents estimate that the finance at present available- to then under their own arrangements permits them to handle at any one moment a unit of approximately 20,000 tons Barley at the various stages, g/ith additional finance their rate of turnover could be increased. In addition there is the point that by increasing the extent to which advances of e. g. 25% . re made to cultivators for Barley lying at suitable points (river bank collect ing centres etc) h6£666 pegging and weighing, a practical contribution can be made towards reducing the liability of the Iraqi Government to the cultivators. Thero is a risk in making such advances which the firms cannot carry on their own account to more than a certain degree but o/hich it may be'well in the interests of H.M. G. to extend.

The conclusion of the Cairo discussions was therefore that action should be taken as outlined in the following paragraph. It would be appreciated if H. ri. Embassy Bagdad would consider these proposals and com:ten t to London. H.M. Embassy as also requested to indicate what would be the probable reaction (if any) of the Iraqi Government on the question, of sending Iraqi Barley to India. No doubt the departments concerned in London will also consider the proposals in this telegram together with any com tents from Bagdad and issue the necessary ins true tions. 14. The action now proposed is as follows (a) Treasury, UKCC London and the firms’ Head Offices to be invited to consider methods by which the Agents will be given additional finance to enable them (i) to increase the rate of purchasing Bailey within the first one-third category, (ii) to cake limited payments to cultivators in advance of taking over the Barleu wherever the Agents consider the rick is not excessive. Iraqi Government to be informed that H. M. G. is doing its utmost to speed up the take-over of Barley in the first one-third category, is calling in for this purpose the full extent of its transport resources and is making advances to cultivators to the fullest extent possible. In this way H. IvLG. is virtually freeimg the Iraqi Govt, from its financial liability to cultivators. In view of this assistance H.M, G. feels entitled to represent to the Iraqi Govt, that the substantial issue nh 1 i n.R-no.p.R for independent dealings under Notification the first 200,000 tons and might even in effect put up the price against H.M. G. For these reasons H.H. G. considers that free issues of such licences would be contrary to clause (a'' of the notes exchanged between the two Governments and therefore requests the co operation of the Iraqi Government not to issue licences at -orosent. If there are any ha??&amp; cases of particular producers cr remote districts still not covered for acceptance of the first one-third nf their Barley after the accelera- -tion projected in (a) above, H. M, G. to assure the Iraqi Government that we are ready to consider special uch Barley taken over As soon as in particular districts the Agents arc in sight of completing takeover of Barley in the first one-third categoryIraqi Government to be requested to issue licences in favour of the sub-agents in such areas for any balance of Barley which the cultivators arc willing to sell. For the present however this point not to be broached with the Iraqy Government.WARNING : This is an unparaphrased version of a secret cypher or confidential code message, and the text must first be paraphrased* if it is essential to communicate it to persons outside British or Allied Government Services.

Telegram July 10th from Government of Indie in reply to the above is strongly endorsed by Middle Last Supply Centre. 3. As a result of tour '(grp. orntd. ?of) .Irab sheikdoms by Captain '.Varner of Middle Last Supply. Centre, Bagdad, it has become clear that the question'whether supply of Iraqi barley/millet to Arab states should be subsidised’ by His Majesty 1 s Government is of urgent practical importance in respect of barley/millet already delivered. 4. Position may be summarised as follows: '.. ■ # * l t ’&gt;; ’ . • r - M (a) “As a result of discussion and communication between Middle East Supply Centre and ?.R.?.G. (See paragraph 5(c) Mides 54 to India) and- by agreement with political authorities concerned the following quantities of barley/millet were despatched by United Kingdom Commercial Corporation irac to Arab states in May: 474 tons to Koweit, 50Q. tons to Bahrein, 400, tons to Muscat via Bahrein, 1,750 tons Muscat to Trucial Coast. (b) Landed cost of barley/millet variesxf^rom ^38 to £41 per ton. • 1 (c) ^oparently (grp. undec.?delivered) cost of this Iraqi grain had not been realised by l-.R. P.G. when arrangements for supply to .Vrab states were agreed on. (d) As--a consequence it is now reported by Middle East Supply Centre representative that barley/millet was not purchased on delivery and that 2,000 (grp. und.ee. 7600 tons of barley/millet have been lying at .destinations in Arab states since* May and are now in imminent danger of deterioration, ..1750 tons held at Sharjah and Dubai on Trucial Coast 900 tens, including 400 tons destined for Muscat held in Bahrein. (e) Political agents of Bahrein, Trucial Coast and Muscat . . . - were unanimous'in emphasising to Middle East Supply Centre .. . • representative that it is impossible to dispose of any of this . grain unless the price is brought below that,of Indian wheat at presen.t being consumed in the .Vrab states. • Predicted cost . . of Indian .wheat is approximately £25 per ton; */.■ (f,) They affirm however that if. the price .question is settled It will be accepted for Consumption, 1 . ' «fe) Further/...(g) Further political a grain can be disposed- of unde due to be presented by United Iraq cannot be met. gents pointed cut that until the . r some subsidy arrangement invoice Kingdom.- Commercial Corporation (h) These amount to approximately £72,000 for' : 'grM4?---d^Id.../^ at Sharjah and Dubai, £19,000 for grain delivered to. Bahrein and 15,000 for Muscat consignment. Total approximately £105,000.Barley/millet'delivered to Koweit has been paid for.. 5. It is non clear that it might have been advisable had time 'permitted to notify estimated landed...price of Iraqi barley/millet to each destination concerned and secure their agreement to purchase at- price quoted before supply action was put in hand (as is now the practice in such cases)* 6. Apart from the fact that this is wisdom after the event, it must be remembered that at the date when supply of these cereals was decided, upon in agreement with political authority concerned, reports of an increasingly serious food position in the Gulf states.were to hand (see Bahrein telegram T/253 to Minister of State). It was also not to be known when emergency supplies of wheat and ri£e from India would become available (dgorlock andMasula cargoes) and action to avoid risk of starvation appeared to be urgently called for at the time. 7. In orde. therefore that the situation which has thus arisen may be satisfactorily terminated, it is considered that a solution should be found along the following lines. (a) Instructions to be issued to political represfi^Vtative in each post that every effort .must be made to ensure that barley/mi1let supply which was definitely requested and which has been delivered shall be'aceCited and paid for* (b) If to ebable this to be done a subsidy by His Majesty’s Government is necessary this to be arranged through whatever channels are most convenient. 8. It will be appreciated that it is all the more essential to enfoie consumption of this barley/millet bef.re it deteriorates _ since, although the wheat position *in Arab states is for the'moment easy, availability of supplies for later months in the year is uncertain.

Dear Davidson, You are, I knovT, aware that difficulties have arisen in regard to the price at which barley and millet are being put into the protected Arab States in the Persian Gulf by the Middle East Supply Centre in place of the wheat and rice which have not been available in sufficient quantities from other sources following the suspension of Indian cereals exports, A copy of a telegram No. Ilf 186 of 26th June, which v/e sent to the Government of India in this connection, has already been copied to you and I now enclose copies of .the three marginally noted telegrams which wi ll give you the No* 1284 of 3rd June from Political Resident to Cairo.

Cairo* , Centre* s Savin gram No.1517*, * which repeats their telegpam No. Hides 54 to Delhi, is also relevant* earlier history. The Middle East Supply 2. We had hoped, at the time of the despatch of our telegram No,.14l86, that the question of subsidising the import of substitute cereals into the Arab States would not have to be pursued because we were under the impression that any supplies which were made between the 1st May (when it was first decided to send barley and millet) and early in June (when the Middle East Supply Centre intimated that the programme had been suspended) would by now have been distributed amongst the hungry, even though resentful, recipients and that the Government of India might solve the problem of the future by resuming responsibility for the supply of acceptable cereals before present stocks were exhausted. There is now enclosed, however, a copy of a telegram No.5566 from the Government of India, from which you will observe that our hopes that past imports had been put into circulation were ill-founded and that the various States concerned have refused, up to the present, ti» accept the consignments of barley and millet which have been sent to them* I, I, D.

If so, you will, presumably issue suitable instructions to UKCC. In vie\7 of the deterioration of the stocks of barley and millet already shipped you will appreciate the need for a very urgent decision. It is understood ^from the Corporation that the cost of the Indian wheat new being supplied to the Persian Gulf area is somewhat in excess of the figure of Rs#320 per ton mentioned in the Political Resident’s telegram No. 1284 of 3rd. June but, whilst we do not feel able to press for the adoption of this figure, it would seem that there is something to be said for disposing of the unsold stocks of barley and-millet, which are understood to be pretty poor stuff, at something less than the cost of the more popular Indian wheat. 7» I am sending copies of this letter to Jourdain, Coulson, Armstrong, Miss Hobley, and Geddes.

Repeated to Political Resident in Persian Gulf and Cairo for Middle East Supply Centre. Your telegram 4748 of 14th June, Cereals for Sheikhdoms, View point adopted by you and by Political Resident is one with wnich I sympathise fully, but I doubt whether any approach could usefully be made to H.M.G. at present. Claim for substitute cereals to be supplied at not more than the cost of Indian wheat appears to be based on the argument that it is manifestly inequitable that Sheikhdoms should be deprived of wheat at reasonable coco when Ea.stern Saudi Arabia is apparently receiving more than minimum requirements and is not being required to make do with a proportion of barley and millet. This argument appears to possess considerable force in regard to supplies put into Sheikhdoms during past months, but I assume that it is now too late to pursue matter so far as such supplies are concerned because they have presumably already been distributed. You will doubtless inform me if my assumption is incorrect. 2. I observe^ from M.E.S.C. telegram MIDES 54 that programme for supply of Iraqi cereals has been suspended temporarily, so that any representations made to H.M.G. can apparently only relate to procedure to be adopted if and when programme is resumed. Such resumption is, however, dependent on your ability or other-wise ^supply of whole of Sheikhdoms cereal requirements before present stocks require to be replenished (stocks are apparently adequate until early August). Validity of argument mentioned in proceeding paragraph may also be affected by pressure wnich has been applied to Saudi authorities to induce them to accept substitute cereals. If this pressure should succeed I fear that in the absence of any new factor it would be difficult to secure any financial relief for Sheikhdoms, although I would of course be prepared to urge reduction of Saudi supplies to figure more nearly approaching previous quota level. 3. In view of these comments I trust you will agree that it would be premature to take up matter with H.M.G, on present hypothetical b^sis. Best solution of difficulty would obviously be resumption of cerea.1 supxolies from India, and I hope that you will be able to give favourable decision on this point very shortly. 4 , I should be gla.d if earliest possible news of your decision as, if you are unable to resume supplies, immediate steps willi have to be taken to arrange them from some source at present undetermined. Please therefore telegraph decision in advance of your views on other points raised./y-* ( pnrcf SujyfAM fa ri Prom: M.P.3.0. Cniro D r 't,ccl: 9-. 6 . 43. .

Dear Jourdain, S-Me*) \9 1943. 321 ^ You will remember receiving a copy of telegram No*12c&gt;4j dated 3rd June, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, which was addressed to the Minister of State and repeated here. Its subject was the high^pidces at which cereals were now being delivered at the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms as opposed to the cost of Indian wheat. The Political Resident pointed out that if the Indian wheat which had been shipped to the' Persian Gulf since March had been allocated to the Sheikhdoms, it would have sufficed them for five months. Instead it had been sent elsewhere to suit H.M.G* s shipping policy and in consequence he asked that the cereals now being sent to the States should be sold to them at the same price as Indian wheat and that H.M.G. should bear the difference. We agreed, if you remember, that we should await the reactions of the M.E.S.C. and of the Government of India, to whom the telegram had also been repeated, before any action need be taken here. We have recently received a telegram on the subject from the Government of India (No.4748 dated 14th June) of which I enclose a copy. This telegram in brief supports the recommendation of the Political Resident and further complains of the discrimination which has been shov/n in favour of Saudi Arabia, both in quantity and quality of cereals. Reference is made to a telegram from the M.E.S.C. No.54 Hides, which had not been repeated here. This telegram has now just arrived in the form of savingram No. 1917 and you will doubtless read this in the light of the Govemmsnt of India* s present comments. Will you let us have your views on the subject as a whole and in particular on the recommendation made by the Political Resident, viz. that H.M.G. should bear the cost of the difference between the price of the cereals now being delivered and that of Indian wheat, as stated in his telegram No. 1284 of 3rd June. It might perhaps be advisable/ E.D. Jourdain, Esq., Ministry of War Transport, Berkeley Square House, Berkeley Square, W.l.- advisable to ascertain from the M.E.S.C. whether in the light of the latest G-overnment of India telegram, which was repeated to Cairo, they can'dispose of the matter themselves or whether they intend to submit proposals for the consideration of vVe feel that if, by the orders of H.M*G-., preferential treatment is given to Saudi Arabia as against the G-ulf Sheikhdoms and the inhabitants of the Sheikhdoms (who have a rather higher standard of living than those of Nejd) see wheat- shipped to Nejd through their ports while they have to be content with inferior cereals, the least we can do to remove this inequity is to see that the Sheikhdoms do not have to pay extortionate prices for the inferior cereals. Incidentally, paragraph four of this telegram gives partial answer to the question which was rai^d at our meeting last Wednesday, viz. whether the Government of India had agreed when meeting the representatives of M.E.S.C. to renew shipments of wheat to the Gulf Sheikhdoms. You will see that they hope to reach a decision on this point shortly. I am sending a copy of this letter, and of the enclosure, to Young’ and’Armstrong. , Yours faithfully, © (Sgd.) W. W.

A, S. C. Nol.60. In discussion with M. E. S* C. representatives, during their recent visit to India we pointed out:- (a) ceroal quota for Eastern Saudi Arabia had been increased from i,ISO tons, fixed when we were supplying Arab coast to 2,000 tons, though (1) Baud! Government had made no complaint while we were supplying, and { 2) quota was fixed on basis of figures supplied by Gulf Resident of actual re-exports from Bahrain and Kcweit to Saudi Arabia (subject to general percentage cut we had made on demands for whole area). (b) decision to supply wheat only to Saudi Arabia while providing large proportions of inferior grains (millet and barley) to Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms is not, warranted by any difference in diet digestion* 2t In their telegram 54 MIDHS dated 11th June (not repeated to London) M.&amp;. S. C. point out that decision to increase Eastern Saudi Arabia quota was result, of political directive from foreign Office and Minister of State* and that decision to supply wheat exclusively was due to definite statement by Ihn Saud-s representatives at Cairo that barley and millet were (? entirely) unacceptable to the population of Saudi Arahiao 3 U We fully recognise the importance of meeting Ibn Sand 5 s demands both in regard to quantity and quality as far as possible, but we think it is clear that demand for 2,000 tons monthly for Ha.sa and Eastern Nejd is in excess of minimum needs, while there can be no question that if Bahraini or Xowaiti will eat millet or barley in preference to starvation so. will Ne^d or Hasawi. If, therefore, for reasons of policy the supply of comparatively cheap wheat to the Gulf Sheikhdoms must be diminished in order to meet Saudi claims we, impossible for Persian Gulf States to absorb Iraqi cereals at this price.

GULF NOW APPROVED FOR CARRYING WHEAT SUPPLY POSITION SHOULD IMPROVE BUT SHOULD EMERGENCY ARISE TRANSHIPMENT CAN BE MADE AS INDICATED OUR 556 ALEXANDER SINGLETONI refer to your letter of the 23 rd Febmary regarding telegram 152 from the Political Agent at Bahrein. It is true tnat so far only one tanker the 'Storaas' has airived at Bahrein with wheat. This vessel carried 53^f tons which should have been sufficient to meet two months' require ments. A second U.S. Navy tanker is now on the way to Bahrein carrying aoout 700 tons which should cover the requiresnents for ithe next two or three months. It is true that tanker shipments in recent months have been somewhat less than expected, and, therefore, it has not been possible to cover the full requirements of 250 tons monthly up to now, but I think it is hardly correct to say, as stated in the telegram, that arrangements for shipment by tanker have broken down. It would seem that Bahrein's needs have been covered by this means except possibly for a small period in February, when no aoubt supplies ran short. It is not clear from the telegram whether the Political Agent is expecting the whole of Bahrein's requirements to be made by tanker shipments. I understood the programme of 250 tons monthly to be for oil company employees only, and that the needs of the civil population would be met by lu.E.S.C. as part of the Arab States' requirements. I shall be glad to know whether you can clarify this point?MBV s (S4J) 2 2?

Your paragraph No* 5. Discrepancy is only apparent not real, (a) In Koweit large additional supplies are required in early months of the year to feed large influx of Iraq and other tribes into Koweit territory for the winter grazing. 510 tons represents average minimum monthly consumption throughout the year. (b) Similarly on Trucial Coast rate of food consumption is not constant throughout the year but doubles itself during the pearling season. Low estimate for three months from the middle of January is due to the fact that consumption is almost halved during this period, when no pearling operations take place. 1855 tons represents average rn i ni mum m ont hly. 5.

Mr. Nind is proposing to reply to telegram No.619 to the effect that the M.E.S.C. have now definitely accepted responsibility for supplying food to the Arab States; that they are reasonably satisfied that they will be able to provide the necessary wheat and will do their best about rice. At the same time it is disturbing that the Ministry of Pood, while assuming that rice for the Gulf must come from Iraq, are waiting for the conclusion of the long-drawn and diff icult Egyptia n negot iations/for the purchase of the Traqi rice. The note of the nesting held on January 18th shows that at that time the M.W.T. saw no shipping obstacle in the way of bringing Egyptian rice to the Gulf; hence I should have thought that the Gulf might be allowed some part of the 76,000 tons referred to in Mr. Sanderson^ letter of February 15th. *6 a. \/ 1 ' % ^ /r W wri P. a. ^ ^ t U A/^-, ^ it'. - t ^ . ■ScwAj ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ t L: knt f[iESc ^ vw fc,- ^ A M f H*-*. ^tz ej x ^ C ' tM- k C tk.£i.C i Lt Um.( INWARD TKLKGRAM SiCRijTT. 5639, (if in' any case Tne communication of the contents of this document to any person outside Government ^ervice is authorised, it must be paraphrased).

They have sent a telegram to the Centre somewhat to this effect: 'Assum ing that you agree to be responsible for food supplies to the Persian Gulf States, please telegraph your proposals for meeting their requirement s ' • vfith regard to rice, the Egyptian Government have apparently agreed to make available, free of export duty, the amount required by the Centre, but negotiations are continuing about the price. Departments here seem fairly optimistic about these negotiations. In addition, Mr. Hind has seen a report from U.K.C.C. to the effect that the Iraqi rice market may be breaking i.e. that the merchants will not be able to hold out much longer for the exorbitant prices which they have hitherto been demanding.

Dear Prior, We have been following with sympathy and anxiety the crisis which has arisen over food supplies to the Persian Gulf States. We fully appreciate the force of the political considerations to which you referred in your telegram to the Minister of State No. 259 of January 22nd, and Scv*- we are doing what we can to draw attention to A their importance. The situation at present is that the authorities here seem to have accepted the position that henceforth the Middle East Supply Centre must be responsible for provisioning the Arab States. Rice is of course the main difficulty, but there is reason to hope that the requisite quantity will be forthcoming, either from Egypt or Iraq, before the existing stocks run out. We are keeping a close watch on this questiorv/9 - 2 - question and are ready and indeed anxious to give all the help we can.

Mely. ^ ^ H 4./ vj % . r f I do not know whether you have seen thdse telegrams about the supply of foodstuffs to the Arab States in the Persian Gulf. 2. The position is as follows. In December, when the situation as regards food supplies to India became so critical, the Government of India said that they could no longer be responsible for supplying cereals to the territories which had hitherto been dependent on them, including the Arab States in the Persian Gulf. They were at first willing to continue supplies on the existing basis up to the end of February, but in their telegram No. 376 of January 16th they said that they v/ere unable to send anything more. The quantities involved are small - see paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s telegram No.401 of the same date. 3. The natural alternative source of supply - indeed no other has been suggested - is the Middle East Supply Centre. The authorities in this country who supervise the Centre’s activities were at first averse from its assuming this additional responsibility, but they now seem reconciled to the inevitable. They say that it will be possible to provide the required quantity of wheat, but the real problem lies in the supply of rice which, for the reasons given in paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s telegram No.376, is absolutely essential for the maintenance of life in the Arab States. At present the latter have stocks in hand to last them from 2 to 3 months. Y/hether it will be possible to provide further supplies seems to depend on whether H.M. Ambassador .at Cairo is authorised to seize a large quantity of rice from the Egyptian Government which the latter is refusing to let us have unless we pay an export duty of £50 per ton. The Foreign Office agreed in November that seizure would become necessary were negotiations to break down, and the Ministry of Food are urging them that the time has come to take thfe.s$ step^; but they do not seem able to screw up the courage to send the necessary instructions to Cairo. (It is understood that the situation remains as described in the note of the meeting held on January 18th, flagged).('brt INWARD TK LEGPAM SSCRjST 2122 in any case the communication of the contents c this document to any person outside Government Service is authorised, it must toe paraphrased) 3 Allotted to .3 &amp; 0» Department.

A meeting was held at 5.30.pm. on January 18th in Mr. Ralph Assheton's room at the Treasury to consider the situation created by Government of India telegram No.376 of 16th January. In addition tfi^Mr. Assheton the following were present. Messrs. 0 f Neill and Ministry of War Jourdain stated that the amount of wheat needed by the Arab States was small and although supplies in the Persian Gulf were distinctly tight, it would be possible to supply it. The real problem, however, lay in providing the rice necessary. This amounted to 1,500 tons monthly for Saudi Arabia on the Red Sea side, 600 tons for Aden, 1,000 for Saudi Arabia on the Persian Gulf side and 3,500 for the Arab Sheikdoms. Sanderson described the position as regards surplus rice in Egypt and in Iraq. Negotiations were going on with the Egyptian Government to let us have 120,000 tons of rice, free of the export duty of £50 per ton which the Egyptian Government had clapped on. Of this amount there should certainly be no difficulty about getting 23,000 tons which the Egyptian Government owed us in repayment of an advance of wheat and rice we had made them. The Chairman suggested that perhaps we should concentrate on this amount at first, but Sanderson stated that he would prefer that negotiations should go forward for the whole amount. The Foreign Office had, in November, despatched a telegram to the Ambassador in which they agreed that if negotiations failed Jourdain Messrs. Sanderson. Eyres. Armstrong Messrs. Dibdin and Kind. Transport. Ministry of Food Foreign Office. War Cabinet Office. India Office. /resortrssorti might b© had to talc© th© ric© by foi'c© and he had infqmjred the Foreign Office that in his opinion the time had come to implement this threat. as regards the Iraqi rice surplus he had asked the U.K.C.C. to make quiet enquiries as to the amount available and the price. He feared that the^ice would be exjibrbitant, somewhere in the neighbourhood of £70 per ton as against the Egyptian home market price of £23 P er ton - He feared that there would *** * nn + K a o r-\ - . -fw i A •IKuT not oe much chance of this price going down until we had obtained rice from Egypt free of the export duty. The representatives thought that a ship '-'could be made available to carry the rice from Egypt if the rice were forthcoming. It was finally agreed that:- 1. must accept the position as far as India was concerned. 2. The first move was to get the Foreign Office going about the Egyptian Government rice. . 3. It would be necessary to report to the Middle East Supply Committee that the approach to India had failed and that the action which the last meeting had approved was now impossible.^ M-3 INWARD TELKGPAM (If in any case the communication of the contents of tjh^a ^ A document to any person outside Government Service .iu-a^eq,ui.red, w J v must be paraphrased).

Possibility of filling January and February quotas plus balance of December 1942 quotas has been anxiously examined. In result we deeply regret that it is impossible to export any more rice wheat or wheat flour either bo Gedda and Persian Gulf to(sic ?fullstop) Up to yesterday we had hoped to send final shipment of 3,000 tons rice from Calcutta for Persian Gulf plus a few hundred tons wheat and flour from Karachi but situation has deteriorated with such rapidity in both ports that there is now no alternative but to divert these consignments to local consumption. 3. Y/e can now only invite attention to the immediate need of providing not only Hejaz and Aden but also the Persian Gulf (Arab Shaikhdome, *Hasa» and part of Ne^d supplied through Bahrein and Koweit) with rice and wheat and flour. We understand recent Egyptian rice harvest was excellent and immediate shipments would save the situation. We must emphasise that rice is essential for the Persian Gulf since (a) it has been major item of local Arab diet for generation* (b) climate causes extremely rapid deterioration of wheat flour which can only be stored for brief periods^ (c) Gulf Arabs have no means of milling wheat apart from very limited capacity in one or two ports, which is required for large wheat eating community of Persian extraction. ,,INDIA OFFICE. E. &amp; 0. 10102/4-3. 6th January, 1943* Dear Jourdain, Thank you for your letter of 5th January, about food supplies to Saudi Arabia and Aden, in which you draw attention to two ^^legrams from Jedda to the Foreign Office which caused you an apprehension lest food supplies from India may cease before the M.E.S.C. is in a position to take over the responsibility for them. We raised this very point with the Govemnent of India in our telegram No.21576 of 16th December, and in their telegram of 26th December, from which I quoted in my letter to you, E.&amp; 0.21365* of* 30th December, they stated specifically that they agreed to continue present supplies for two months until new arrangements are made. In another portion of the telegram they defined these two months as January and Februaiy 1943* This, I think, makes it clear that they expect other arrangements to be made in time for supplies to arrive by the beginning of March, but will continue to supply up till then. I cannot find anything in telegram No. 2 of 2nd January from Jedda to suggest that the Government of India are likely to default on this arrangement, as the Minister states that the Government of India have informed him that they are contem plating the imposition of an embargo etc., and again that 'it would be disastrous to this country if Indian supplies through Persian Gulf ports were to cease before complete arrangements had been made to replace them from elsewhere'. As regards supplies from India to the Persian Gulf, you will recollect that in my letter of 3^th December I mentioned that we had asked the Government of India about supplies to Arab States in the Persian Gulf. We have Just received their reply to this question and I enclose a copy of it. You will see that for the reason stated they are not in a position to feed Arab tribes in the Persian Gulf for more than two months. It will in consequence be necessary to ask the M.E.S.C. to take over this responsibility in addition to feeding Saudi Arabia and Aden. Accordingly I give below a statement of the monthly quotas for rice and wheat and wheat flour which had previously been fixedmm m 7 by India. In addition, there were quotas for barley, jowar, (millet) dhal and gram. That for barley amounted to a little under 150 tons monthly and the quantities of the other grain^i were less than 20 tons.

SECRET XXX r ' IMPORTANT. 20480. External Affairs Department. Your telegram No. 9386 of 26th November. Rice for Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf. Recent Cabinet direction regarding rice for Ceylon invited me to ensure that the Government of India were aware of the urge icy of meeting Ceylon’s minimum requirements for rice and the importance of building up reasonable reserve stocks, adding that the Government of India should be urged to assure the delivery of 36,500 tons of rice during t^e months of November and December, and to make every possible effort to send increased quantities during that period, and that they should be asked lurther to arrange for larger shipments to be made after the beginning of the New Year. 2. You will have seen from Ministry of War Transport’s telegram to M.E.S.C. No. 2422 Mast Esmid dated 20th November, repeated to you as No 17 Mast, that arrangements are in progress to provide monthly 2535 tons wheat for Saudi Arabia of which 1070 tons . are via Persian Gulf. I understand that chances of M.E.S.C. making this latter quantity available under two months is remote, but I suggest that •remaining 1465 tons might be made available during December and could for that month be spread between Jeddah and Aden so as to reduce as far as possible percentage of substitution of wheat for rice and enable you to provide additional 1500 tons for Ceylon during December out of quotas for Aden and Saudi Arabia. Details of distribution should be-arranged by you direct with M.E.S.C. * 3. In view of Cabinet direction you should spare no effort to do this. 4.

This involves correspondence discussing the minimum requirements of these states, sources of supply, and the availability of shipping.Specific policy questions included in the file are: the search for alternative sources of cereals as a result of the ban on exports from India following the Bengal Famine of 1943-1944; the question of whether the British Government should subsidise Iraqi cereals supplied to the Persian Gulf to match the price of cereals previously imported from India; the question of using oil tankers to ship wheat to Bahrain; and proposals for increases in the tea and sugar quotas for the Persian Gulf States in order to facilitate barter trade with Persia [Iran].The problem of global rice shortages also receives attention in the file; rice supplies to the Persian Gulf were completely cut off following the Indian export ban. This includes attempts to try to restore the supply of rice, such as an effort by the Gulf States to purchase rice from Persia in 1945. A note prepared by Colonel Harold Richard Patrick Dickson on the dietary problems of the Bedouin of Kuwait and north-east Arabia resulting from the cessation of rice imports can be found on folios 136-140.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Percy Gordon Loch, Charles Geoffrey Prior, and Arnold Crawshaw Galloway), officials of the Foreign Office, officials of the India Office (from August 1947 the Commonwealth Relations Office), officials of the Middle East Supply Centre, officials of the Ministry of Food, officials of the Ministry of War Transport, officials of the Treasury, and representatives of the Government of India – in the Commercial, External, and Food departments respectively.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
