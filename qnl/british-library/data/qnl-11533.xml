More then forty years have passed since its first appearance, yet it is not forgotten, but seems as fresh now, ; in its middle age, as when it astonished the world at its birth t in 1855. Its vivid descriptions, its pungent uncompromising style, its intense personal 'note', distinguish it broadly from the common run of books of travel j and the picture it gives of Arab life and manners, the insight it reveals in Semitic ideas, give it a permanent value as a national record, as true to-day as half a century ago, and as true then as a thousand years before. Dashed off in Burton s rapid impulsive way, the book is the strangest compound of keen observation, wide Oriental learning, a grim sardonic humour, and an insobriety of opinion expressed in the writer's vigorous verna cular. As a brilliant account of the Muslim Hajj and the life of the pilgrims, and as a candid revelation of a powerful un bridled character, the book will hold a place of its own among the classics of travel, and, unlike many classics, it will also hold its readers. It is, however, neither 'to bury Caesar after the manner of classics, nor yet 'to praise him'' that these few pages are set in front of so well-known a work as the Pilgrimage of the 'mjj Abdullah.' Their object is rather to discover how Burton came to achieve this astonishing feat without detec- tion. Anyone, of course, who chooses to profess Islam publicly before the Mohammadan authorities, has the right to go on pilgrimage to the Holy Cities, the Hctvaiucyu of Arabia, and he would probably accomplish the journey in safety unless the devout mob were in an unusually fanatical temper or had suspicions of the sincerity of his conversion. Burton, however, made no such profession of faith; he posed^ not as a rene gade from Christianity, but as a born Muslim. 'My spirit;'x Introduction he wrote, 'could not bend to own myself a Burma, a rene gade—to be pointed at and shunned and catechised, an object of suspicion to the many and of contempt to all.' He would go as a born believer. He seemed to find a moral superiority in the larger, more fundamental deception, and to the casuist the delicate distinction offers a tempting problem. Worthy people have cast heavy stones at Burton for his assumed apostasy, but he is probably within his rights in maintaining that this is a matter which concerns nobody but himself. There can be no question, however, that his imper sonation multiplied the difficulties of the task. In the new convert much might be excused on the ground of unfami- liarity with the customs, ritual, and language; but the born Muslim had no such refuge. He must be circumspect in every act and word, ever on his guard lest a trivial lapse in ordinary behaviour, still more the slightest deviation from prescribed religious observances, bewray him. No one who has not studied Isldm in its own lands can realise the minute ness and multiplicity of the rules which every Muslim continually observes in all the common acts of daily life. Burton has given one example, in the various processes composing the simple operation of drinking water (p. 6); and it may be added that the position of the thumbs in performing a rek'a or bowing at prayer may convict a man of flagrant heresy. All these details must not only have been known but assiduously practised by 'Hajj Abdullah' before he ventured to risk his life in the pilgrimage: for in such a case discovery un questionably spelt death. The inevitable penalty of detection perhaps suggested the popular legend that Burton shot a man or two, who discovered him in an unorthodox attitude. Apart from other objections, he carried no firearms. His own modest confession was that he never killed a man in his life, and one can imagine that he made it with a certain regret. The successful disguise which carried Burton through the perils described in these volumes was no new experiment. He had practised it frequently in India. Indeed the ten years preceding the pilgrimage to Mekka were chiefly spent m a long apprenticeship to Eastern life. Curst, or blest, with a spirit of incurable restlessness, his life had been a wanderer s almost from the first. How the man whom hisIntroduction xi friends affectionately and not inappropriately called 'Ruffian Dick' came to be grandson of the Reverend Edward Burton, rector of Tuam, is one of the mysteries of heredity; but there were other elements in his ancestry to which he showed a more natural affinity. His father, Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Netterville Burton of the 36th Regiment, was a thorough Irishman and a confirmed wanderer. Through him came not only the Irish daredevilry, but also the primitive instincts of the Westmoreland Border. From his mother he inherited a strain of the MacGregors, and he was proud of a remote drop of Bourbon blood from the wrong side of the blanket. People even discovered in his face as well as his character a touch of the Gipsy race, ever wild and intractable, fierce and resentful, intolerant of convention and self-restraint. His bringing-up encouraged his natural impulse. Born in Hert fordshire,—quite a respectable county—19 March, 1821, his childhood was spent partly in France, partly in Italy, and an irregular education, however stimulating to his genius for spoken dialects, ended at Trinity College, Oxford, somewhat summarily, in rustication. It is not easy to picture Burton at chapel and lecture, but one can readily fancy him 'gated,' and even view him arguing his case with before an amazed but magisterial common-room. How completely out of touch with Oxford ideas was this young fire-eater, fresh from continental life, may be judged by his treatment of the ordinary undergraduate, who laughed at his fierce moustache, and was immediately requested to name his seconds! He was scarcely more in his element when he found him self a lieutenant in the 18th Bombay Native Infantry at Baroda in October 1842. Discipline of any sort was distaste- 'ful to the 'amateur barbarian,' and he wearied of the un varying mess and the Anglo-Indian notion of life, with its dull routine of meaningless parades and tiresome courts- martial,—where the business of life is comprised in ignoble official squabbles, dislikes, disapprobations, and references to superior authority', where social intercourse is crushed by 'gup', gossip, and the scandal of small colonial circles so he wrote of Aden a little later. He thirsted for freedom, and his appointment soon afterwards as assistant in the Survey of Sind gave him the liberty and opportunities he wanted.xii Introduction The seven years he spent in India, in fact, laid the founda tions of all his later achievements. The talent for languages, discovered in Europe, was developed in India in marvellous perfection. Even at Oxford he had begun to teach himself Arabic. In London he had worked at Hindustani with old Duncan Forbes. But once in the living East his industry and attainments became phenomenal. One after the other he mastered the various spoken languages and dialects of the people of India. Hindustani, Gujarati, Marathi, Persian, Multani, even the complexities of Arabic, seemed to come by nature, and in the Government examinations he came out first. A visit to the Deccan on sick-leave in 1847 led to the study of Dravidian tongues, Telugu and Toda; and at odd times he amused himself with Sanskrit, Turkish, Pushtu, and Armenian. Thus equipped, he mixed with the people as one of themselves. 'So,' as he wrote in a fragment of autobiography, 'after the first year, when I had Persian at my fingers' ends, sufficient Arabic to read, write, and converse fluently, and a superficial knowledge of that dialect of Punjaubee which is spoken in the wilder parts of the province, I began the systematic study of the Sindian people s P rec 'The first difficulty was to pass for an Oriental, and this was as ,' fc S( necessary as it was difficult. The European official in India seldom if ever, sees anything in its real light, so dense is the veil which the the A P re j udic e, and the superstitions of the This is natives hang before his eyes. And the white man lives a life so dis- litktnfl tinct from the black, that hundreds of the former serve through what , .f they call their 'term of exile' without once being present at a circum- aSfte ^ cision feast, a wedding, or a funeral... After trying several characters, 4e fj iran^n Sle !.U 0 assu ™ed was, I found, that of a half-Arab, half- JO doubt Iranian, such as may be met with in thousands along the northern » shore of the Persian gulf. 5 em WSOpe ' With hair falling upon his shoulders, a long beard, face and hands t0 ^ 'Ot Sire— Wlth 3 ^ COat 0f henna ' Mirza Ab(lull ah of tt , humble servant—set out upon many and many a trip. do mnHi He was a dazzaz, a vendor of fine linen, calicoes, and muslins—such « chapmen are sometimes admitted to display their wares even in Ae ^ C01 sacred harem, by 'fast' and fashionable dames—and he had a little Swai pack of bijouterie and veriu reserved for emergencies. It was onlv to the nr however, when absolutely necessary that he displayed h s stockS' book ' trade; generally, he contented himself with alluding to it on aU 1' 5 possible occasions, boasting largely of his traffic, and askine a thou ^ W sand questions concerning the state of the market.

He secured numberless invitations, was proposed to by several papas, and won, or had to think he won, a few hearts; for he came as a rich man, and he stayed with dignity, and he departed exacting all the honours. 'The timid villagers collected in crowds to see the rich merchant in Oriental dress, riding spear in hand, and pistols in his holsters, towards the little encampment pitched near their settlements. But regularly every evening on the line of march the Mirza issued from his tent and wandered amongst them, collecting much information. Now and then he rented a shop, and furnished it with clammy dates, viscid molasses, tobacco, ginger, rancid oil, and strong-smelling sweet meats; and wonderful tales Fame told about these establishments. Sometimes the Mirza passed the evening in a mosque, listening to the ragged students who, stretched at full length with their stomachs on the dusty floor, and their arms supporting their heads, mumbled out Arabic from the thumbed, soiled, and tattered pages of theology upon which a dim oil light shed its scanty ray; or he sat debating the niceties of faith with the long-bearded, shaven-pated, blear-eyed, and stolid-faced genius loci, the Mullah. At other times, when in merrier mood, he entered uninvited the first door whence issued the sounds of music and the dance;—a clean turban and a polite bow are the best 4 tickets for soup' the East knows. Or he played chess with some native friend, or he consorted with the hemp-drinkers and opium- eaters in the estaminets, or he visited the Mrs. Gadabouts and Gobe- tvveens who make matches amongst the Faithful, and gathered from them a precious budget of private history and domestic scandal. u What scenes he saw! What adventures he went through! But who would believe, even if he ventured to detail them?'* This is his own story, and Burton might be suspected without offence of an occasional use of the 'long bow,' as well as the sword, whereof he became a famous d'amies: but the facts are confirmed by other witnesses, and there is no doubt that his disguise in dress, manners, and languages was so perfect that he even deceived his own Persian munshi, to say nothing of the far easier feat of passing his mess-mates and commanding officer unrecognised. A wig and goggles may do wonders, but it is when the beak opens that the parrot stands confessed. His wanderings in Bind whilst engaged on the Survey led to the production of one of his most interesting and vivid books, 'Scinde or the Unhappy Valley' (published in 1851). During his seven years in India he had written much: gram matical papers on Jataki, MuMni, and Pushtu, for the Journal * Life of Sir R. F. Burton, by Isabel Burton, i, 155—7. 1xiv Introduction of the Bombay Branch of the Asiatic Society (1849); reports to Government on Sind; a volume on the races of the Valley of the Indus; 'Goa and the Blue Mountains' (1851); and 'Falconry in the Valley of the Indus' (1852). Fever and severe opthalmia, partly due to over-study and over-exertion,— combined with disgust at seeing no fighting, and disappoint ment at the ill-success of his application for the post of interpreter in the Sikh War-led to his return to Europe in 1850 on sick-leave. It was practically the end of his Indian career. Already, when mingling with the Muslims in Sind, Burton had formed the wish to visit Mekka during the pilgrimage; but it would be a mistake to set down that adventurous journey, described in these volumes, wholly to curiosity and love of danger. The pilgrimage of 1853 was designed as a part ^ P™ of a larger scheme—to cross 'The Empty Abode,' the great ^ S avf Eastern wilderness, to Maskat, and by this exploration to # 111 remove a discreditable 'huge white blot' from the map of ® ore haz Arabia. The scheme was frustrated by a quarrel amongst the ^ P rovisi tribes, and only the first stage was accomplished. It is but ^ ^ just to remember that with Burton the passion of the ex- cr starvat plorer marched pari passu with the restlessness of the wan- ' First Fo derer: rove he must, but he would rove by preference in untrodden paths, and thus make his love of adventure mimster to the advance of geographical science. He had been in communication with the Royal Geograph ical Society before the Mekka pilgrimage, and his next journey was undertaken with a strictly geographical object. The Indian Government had long desired an exploration of the dangerous Somali country, which had, and has still, a special importance for the Red Sea trade; and Burton's proposal to conduct a small expedition was cautiously accepted. He had found V ret ^ rn 1 f d t0 Bomba y fr0l n Arabia, but October 1854 d him back again at Aden preparing to enter another terra mcogmta He had the cooperation of three young officers, one of them Lieutenant Speke ; but the most nerif ous and difficult part of the expLatiin he^ the interior to Harar, the capital of the country he Seved fi^ntered^his 110 / ROmmCatholic Nonaries, entered thls forbidding city, which shared with Tim- of travel. natives; c aived el( night not draw i He was javelin wi after, voli spirits,' a fehi-Boz get into 0 in East A iourney t from the Geograpl;Introduction xv buktu the reputation of the white man's grave: ' The bigoted and barbarous people threatened death to the infidel who ventured within its walls; some negro Merlin having, it is said, read Decline and Fall in the first footsteps of the Frank.' This courageous adventure has never been appreciated as it deserves. Lady Burton does not exaggerate (for once) when she describes it as 'one of his most splendid and dangerous expeditions. He disappeared into the desert for tour months*, but this unnoticed, unknown journey has been of great importance to the Egyptians, to the English, and now to the Italian army. At last the 'Dreadful City' was sighted, and relying on his good Star and audacity, he walk ed boldly in, sending his compliments to the Amir and ask ing for audience. His diplomacy on this occasion, his capacity for passing as an Arab, and his sound Mohammadan theo logy, gave him ten days in the city, where he slept every night in peril of his life,' The return journey was even more hazardous; he was now dogged by hostile tribesmen, his provisions, and, worse still, water ran short, and he crossed the thirsty desert in daily expectation of death by violence or starvation. The narrative of the expedition to Harar, 'First Footsteps in East Africa' (1856) is one of the most exciting, amusing, learned, and thorough, of his many books of travel. Hardly had he got back to Aden from this ex hausting ride when, in attempting to lead a further expedi tion into Somali Land in April 1855, he was set upon by the natives; one of his officers, Stroyan, was killed; Speke re ceived eleven wounds, and Burton himself spent an agonis ing night with a javelin through his mouth which he could not draw out. He was made of tougher stuff, however, than to care about javelin wounds. The misadventure did not daunt him, for after - volunteering for the Crimean War 'to recover his spirits,' and holding a congenial commission in Beatson's Bashi-Bozuks at the Dardanelles, which had the bad luck to get into official disgrace and never smelt powder, he was back in East Africa, this time at Zanzibar, by December 1856. The journey to Harar, the first attempt to penetrate East Africa from the Red Sea, had led to larger efforts. The Royal Geographical Society had marked the born explorer, andXVI Introduction had induced the Foreign Office to send him out to investi gate the unknown Lake region of Equatorial Africa, where lay the hidden sources of the Nile. He was again accom panied by Speke, and after many adventures, difficulties, and hardships, in February 1858 they were the first Euro peans to set eyes on Lake Tanganyika. After exploring the northern end of the lake. Burton fell ill, but in July he had already roughly mapped out from Arab information the f position of the Ukerewe Lake, or Victoria Nyanza; and during his disablement Captain Speke went north and found the great lake exactly where Burton had placed it. On the unhappy disputes that followed there is no need to dwell. Burton had discovered the Tanganyika and Speke had found the Victoria Nyanza, and each claimed to have at last settled the eternal problem of the source of the Nile. The really important point to notice is that Burton's expedition was the P forerunner and direct incentive to all subsequent explorations: his discovery of the Tanganyika led to the later and more renowned journeys of Speke and Grant, Baker, Livingstone and Stanley; and his work on 'The Lake Regions of Equa torial Africa' (i860, with the 33rd volume of the Proceed- ings of the Royal Geographical Society) is the true parent ot the ponderous literature of Central African exploration As^ Burton was the first Englishman who succeeded in per forming the Pilgrimage to Medina and Mekka, so was he the first to visit the interior of East Africa, and the first to enter the region of the great Equatorial Lakes. He was the original pioneer in those countries which under the names of British and Italian Somlli Land and British East Africa have 1 since acquired international significance, and are probably destined to play an important part in the future development of the no longer Dark Continent. Three years later he was exploring another part of Africa which also has been brought into the front of imperial ' questions '—the Gold Coast, Da homey, and the Bight of Benin. By accident, foresight, or as he would have said, Fate, he was in the van of three great movements m the expansion of England.

' Such a career,' continued Lord Stanley, 'does as much as a success ful campaign to keep up in the minds of the English people that spirit of adventure and of enterprise, that looking to reputation rather than to money, to love of effort rather than to ease,—the old native English feeling which has made i this country what it has become, and without which our wealth and our material prosperity would not be worth one year's purchase.' After 1858 Burton saw no more of the interior of East Africa. The quarrel with Speke, and the way in which his own services were passed over, embittered him, and he made a tour in the western world to recover tone. He travelled nearly 30,000 miles by sea and land. Visiting Salt Lake City, M he expressed a wish to be received into the community of the Mormons; but Brigham Young, remembering the Mekka incident, shook his head and shrewdly replied, 'No, Captain, I think you have done that sort of thing once before 1' Nevertheless Burton's 'City of the Saints' (1861) presented a vivid picture of Mormon life, 'the most accurate description,' said a good judge, of 'morally, the most eccentric pheno menon of our days.' Since 1849 Captain Burton's connexion with the Indian army had been somewhat nominal; in 1861 he entered the service of the Foreign Office, and remained a consul for the rest of his life. In that year he married Isabel Arundell, and of all the exploits of his varied career there was none which so honoured him as his power to win that rare * and exquisite devotion with which she worshipped and served him through nearly thirty years of trial, hard work, poverty, exile, deadly climates, official difficulties, and latterly frequent illness. Lady Burton's romantic, ill-balanced, exaggerated bio graphy of her husband is, with all its patent faults, one of the most pathetic and moving monuments which the unselfish love of a woman has ever raised to the memory of her hero. No man could dare to call himself worthy of such devotion. Unlucky in many things, 'Ruffian Dick' was supremely fortunate in his marriage. In a merely material sense, too, Mrs, Burton brought her husband better fortune. Her connexions enabled her to keep 11xvm Introduction him before the official mind, and it is safe to say that with out her aid he would have found some difficulty in getting and more in keeping his consular appointments. He held successively the consulates at Fernando Po, from 1861, Santos in Brazil, 1865, Damascus, 1869, and Trieste, 1871 to 1890. Of these the one post for which his tastes, knowledge, and experience seemed to have peculiarly fitted him was the Damascus consulate, where he found himself completely in his element, and looked forward to years of work among the Arabs and in Arabic literature. The causes which led to his summary recall cannot be discussed within the limits of these few pages, but although it is well known that the Foreign Office resorts to such extreme measures with the greatest reluctance and only upon grave provocation^ Burton's friends and students of the East never ceased to regret his loss at Damascus and his comparative obscurity at Trieste. It was certainly a curious anomaly that two of the most brilliant Arabic scholars of the day should be placed officially where their special acquirements were peculiarly useless—Burton at the Consulate of Trieste, and Palgrave at the Legation of Montevideo. Incompatibility of temper accounts for much, however, in official as well as domestic life, and perhaps neither of these distinguished scholars was particularly easy to live with, or made a model subordinate. Burton's opportunities, however, were not neglected at his various consular posts. His explorations whilst stationed at Fernando Po led to the publication of two Volumes of 'Wanderings in West Africa' (1863), two more on 'Abeo- kuta and the Cameroons' (1863), and yet another pair on his 'Mission to the King of Dahome' (1864), with a con cluding 'Wit and Wisdom from West Africa' (1864). 'The Highlands of Brazil' (1869), represented th^ results of his experience at Santos and in the interior of South America. 'Letters from the Battlefields of Paraguay' (1870), record a journey across the continent from Argentina to Peru. The residence at Damascus and many excursions are reflected in 'Unexplored Syria', in which his intrepid wife collabor ated (1872). Other works of his later years, the fruit of various journeys and revisitings of former scenes, were 'Zanzibar' (1872), 'Ultima Thule, a summer in Iceland' (1875), 'Gorilla use4 Introduction xix Land or the Cataracts of the Congo' (1875), 'Etruscan Bologna' (1876), 'Sind revisited' (1877), 'The Gold Mines of Midian' (1878), 'The Land of Midian' (1879), 'To the Gold Coast for Gold' (1883). Most of these works were in two volumes, and the total number of volumes he published was nearly seventy. On his favourite weapon he wrote ' The Book ofthe Sword' Vol. I, (1884),, and 'A New System of Sword Exer cise' (1875), besides a 'Complete System of Bayonet Exer cise' (1853). He contributed papers to the proceedings ofthe Royal Geographical, Asiatic, and Anthropological Societies, and wrote for various magazines and newspapers. Among his latest works were his translations of the Lusiads of Camoens (6 Vols. 1880), and of the Arabian Nights (16 Vols. 1885—8). Burton's translation of the Arabian Nights is, in its way, even more celebrated than his Pilgrimage to Mekka. When he was making his less famous journey to Harar, he used to delight his Arab friends at Zeyla by reading them tales from the Thousand and One Nights 'that wonderful work, so often translated, so much turned over, and so little understood at home. The most familiar of books in England, next to the Bible, it is one of the least known; the reason being that about one-fifth is utterly unfit for translation; and the most sanguine Orientalist would not dare to render literally more than three-quarters of the remainder. Consequently the reader loses the contrast—the very essence of the book.' * The ' san guine Orientalist' nevertheless dididare to attempt thirty years later what he declared to be impossible in 1855; but he ex pressly prepared his ' literal rendering ' for the use of students, and printed it for private circulation. As a monument of his Arabic learning and his encyclopaedic knowledge of Eastern life the translation of the Thousand and One Nights was Burton's greatest achievement. It is open to criticism in many ways, but when all is said, it is a remarkable performance. It reveals its writer's astonishing familiarity with the argot and 'Billingsgate' of the Arabs, no less than with their most secret, and, it must be added, most disgusting habits. As a witness to his profound acquaintance with the vocabulary and customs of the Muslims, the translation is unimpeachable; but * R. F. Burton, First Footsteps in East Africa, i 5 26 (Memorial Ed.).1 xx Introduction it testifies no less clearly to an attitude of attraction towards all that is most repulsive in life and literature, which has procured it a peculiar notoriety that has no relation to its scholarship. The ' anthropological' notes, which have obtained it a costly but unenviable place among the works labelled ' curious' in booksellers' catalogues, evince an intimate ac- I quaintance with Oriental depravity, the confession of which has at best the merit of boldness, whilst the elaborate exposition of so much indescribable filth can scarcely be matter of congratulation. It seems that the Pilgrimage to Mekka itself was only saved from the top shelf by the absence of its author from England; for Sir Gardner Wilkinson, to whom the manuscript was entrusted, remarked that the amount of unpleasant garbage which he took upon himself to reject would have rendered the book unfit for publication. Apart from this characteristic, the translation of the Thousand and One Nights is often marked by extraordinary resource and felicity in the exaqt reproduction of the sense. Burton's vocabulary was marvellously extensive, and he often found the right ' expression where everyone else had failed. But his fancy for archaic words and phrases, his habit of coining a word when none seemed fitted to his purpose, and the harsh and rugged style he affected, detract from the literary quality of the work • without really enhancing its fidelity to the original. With grave defects, but sometimes brilliant merits, the translation holds a mirror to its author. Sir Richard Burton, who was created a Knight Commander . of the most distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1885, held his consulship at Trieste for eighteen years, and died there 20th October, 1890, in his seventieth year. His body was embalmed, and rests at Mortlake under an Arab tent, of stone and marble, erected by his devoted wife. S tanley L ane- P oole.PREFACE to the THIRD EDITION After a lapse of twenty-five years, a third edition of my Pilgrimage has been called for by the public, to whom I take this opportunity of returning thanks. Messrs. Mullan have chosen the very best opportunity. My two publications concerning the Khedival Expeditions to Midian ('The Gold Mines of Midian,' and 'The Land of Midian Revisited'), are, as I have stated in the Preface, sequels and continuations of this Pilgrimage from which the adventures forming their subject may be said to date. The text has been carefully revised, and the 'bag gage of notes' has been materially lightened. 1 From the Appendix I have removed matter which, though useful to the student, is of scant general interest. The quaint and interesting 'Narrative and Voyages of Ludovicus Vertomannus, Gentleman of Rome,' need no longer be read in extracts, when the whole has been printed by the Hakluyt Society. (The Travels of Ludovico di Var- thema in Egypt, Syria, Arabia Deserta and Arabia Felix, in Persia, India, and Ethiopia, a.d. i5 0 3 t 0 i 5 0 ^• Trans lated from the original Italian edition of 1510, with a Preface by John Winter Jones, Esq., F.S.A., an d edited, 1 These omitted notes and appendices have all been restored to the present Edition. V V:XXII Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah with notes and an Introduction, by George Percy Badger, late Government Chaplain in the Presidency of Bombay. London.) On the other hand, I have inserted after the Appendix, with the permission of the author, two highly interesting communications from Dr. Aloys Sprenger, the well-known Orientalist and Arabist, concerning the routes of the Great Caravans. My friend supports his suspicions that an error of direction has been made, and geographers will enjoy the benefit of his conscientious studies, topo graphical and linguistic. The truculent attacks made upon pilgrims and Dar- wayshes call for a few words of notice. Even that learned and amiable philanthropist, the late Dr. John Wilson of Bombay ('Lands of the Bible,' vol. ii., p. 302) alludes, in the case of the Spaniard Badia, Ali Bey al-Abbasi, to the 'unjustifiable fanciful disguise of a Mohammedan Pilgrim.' The author of the Ruddy Goose Theory (' Voice of Israel from Mount Sinai') and compiler of the 'His torical Geography of Arabia' has dealt a foul blow to the memory of Burckhardt, the energetic and inoffensive Swiss traveller, whose name has ever been held in the highest repute. And now the ' Government Chaplain ' indites (Introduction, p. xxvii.) the following invidious remarks touching the travels of Ludovico di Varthema —the viv Deo cams, be it remarked, of the learned and laical Julius Caesar Scaliger: 'This is not the place to discuss the morality of an act involving the deliberate and voluntary denial of what a man holds to be truth in a matter so sacred as that of Religion. Such a violation of conscience is not justifiable by the end which the renegade (!) may have in view, however abstractedly praiseworthy it may be; and even granting that his demerit should be gauged by the amount of knowledge which he possesses of what is true and what false, the conclusion is inevitable, that nothin 0, short of utter ignorance of the precepts of his faith, or aPreface to the XXIII conscientious disbelief in them, can fairly relieve the Christian, who conforms to Islamism without a corres ponding persuasion of its verity, of the deserved odium all honest men attach to apostasy and hypocrisy.' The reply to this tirade is simply, 'Judge not; especi ally when you are ignorant of the case which you are judging.' Perhaps also the writer may ask himself, Is it right for those to cast stones who dwell in a tenement not devoid of fragility ? The second attack proceeds from a place whence no man would reasonably have expected it. The author of the 'Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia' (vol. i., pp. 258-59) thus expresses his opinions:— ' Passing oneself off for a wandering Darweesh, as some European explorers have attempted to do in the East, is for more reasons than one a very bad plan. It is unnecessary to dilate on that moral aspect of the pro ceeding which will always first strike unsophisticated minds. To feign a religion which the adventurer himself does not believe, to perform with scrupulous exactitude, as of the highest and holiest import, practices which he inwardly ridicules, and which he intends on his return to hold up to the ridicule of others, to turn for weeks and months together the most sacred and awful bearings of man towards his Creator into a deliberate and truthless mummery, not to mention other and yet darker touches, —ail this seems hardly compatible with the character of a European gentleman, let alone that of a Christian.' This comes admirably a from a traveller who, born a Protestant, of Jewish descent, placed himself 'in connection with,' in plain words took the vows of, 'the order of the Jesuits,' an order 'well-known in the annals of philanthropic daring'; a popular preacher who de claimed openly at Bayrut and elsewhere against his own nation, till the proceedings of a certain Father Michael/ xxiv Pilgrimage to A l-Madinah Meccah. Cohen were made the subject of an official report by Mr. Consul-General Moore (Bayrut, November n, 1857); an Englishman by birth who accepted French protection, a secret mission, and the ' liberality of the present Em peror of the French'; a military officer travelling in the garb of what he calls a native (Syrian) 'quack' with a comrade who 'by a slight but necessary fiction passed for his brother-in-law 1 '; a gentleman who by return to Protestantism violated his vows, and a traveller who was proved by the experiment of Colonel (now Sir Lewis) Pelly to have brought upon himself all the perils and adventures that have caused his charming work to be considered so little werthy of trust. Truly such attack argues a sublime daring. It is the principle of ' vieille coquette, nouvelle devote ' ; it is Satan preaching against Sin. Both writers certainly lack the 'giftie' to see themselves as others see them. In noticing these extracts my object is not to defend myself: I recognize no man's right to interfere between a human being and his conscience. But what is there, I would ask, in the Moslem Pilgrimage so offensive to Christians—what makes it a subject of 'inward ridicule'? Do they not also venerate Abraham, the Father of the Faithful ? Did not Locke, and even greater names, hold Mohammedans to be heterodox Christians, in fact Arians who, till the end of the fourth century, represented the mass of North-European Christianity? Did Mr. Lane neverconform by praying at a Mosque in Cairo ? did he ever fear to confess it ? has he been called an apostate for so doing ? Did not Father Michael Cohen prove himself an excellent Moslem at Wahhabi-land. The fact is, there are honest men who hold that Al- * The brother-in-law, Barakat J'rayj followed suit : educated at the Jesuit college of Mu'allakah (Libanus) of Zahleh 38 a Greek Cath0llC prieSt at the neighbouring townPreface to the xxv Islam, in its capital tenets, approaches much nearer to the faith of Jesus than do the Pauline and Athanasian modi fications which, in this our day, have divided the Indo- European mind into Catholic and Roman, Greek and Russian, Lutheran and Anglican. The disciples of Dr. Daniel Schenkel'sschool ('A Sketch of the Character of Jesus,' Longmans, 1869) will indeed find little difficulty in making this admission. Practically, a visit after Arab Meccah to Angle-Indian Aden, with its ' priests after the order of Melchisedeck,' suggested to me that the Moslem may be more tolerant, more enlightened, more charitable, than many societies of self-styled Christians. And why rage so furiously against the ' disguise of a wandering Darwaysh?' In what point is the Dar- waysh more a mummer or in what does he show more of Utise than the quack? Is the Darwaysh anything but an Oriental Freemason, and are Freemasons less Chris tians because they pray with Moslems and profess their belief in simple unitarianism ? I have said. And now to conclude. After my return to Europe, many inquired if I was not the only living European who has found his way to the Head Quarters of the Moslem Faith. I may answer in the affirmative, so far, at least, that when entering the penetralia of Moslem life my Eastern origin was never questioned, and my position was never what would describe as in loco apostatce. On the other hand, any jew, Christian, or Pagan, after declaring before the Kazi and the Police Authori ties at Cairo, or even at Damascus, that he embraces Al-Islam, may perform, without fear of the so-called Mosaic institution, ' Al-Sunnah,' his pilgrimage in all safety. It might be dangerous to travel down the Desert- line between Meccah and Al-Madinah during times of popular excitement; but the coast route is always safe. To the 'new Moslem,' however, the old Moslem is rarelyxxvi Pilgrimage, to A l-Madinah well affected; and the former, as a rule, returns home unpleasantly impressed by his experiences. The Eastern world moves slowly— muove. Half a generation ago steamers were first started to Jeddah: now we hear of a projected railroad from that port to Meccah, the shareholders being all Moslems. And the example of Jerusalem encourages us to hope that long before the end of the century a visit to Meccah will not be more difficult than a trip to Hebron. Ziyadeh hadd-i-adah London, 31st 1879.

Jl The interest just now felt in everything that relates to the East would alone be sufficient to ensure to the author of ' El Medinah and Meccah' the favourable consideration of the Reading Public. But when it is borne in mind that since the days of William Pitts of Exeter (a.d. 1678—1688) no European travellers, with the exception of Burckhardt 1 and Lieut. Burton, 2 have been able to send us back an account of their travels there, it cannot be doubted but that the present work will be hailed as a welcome addition to our knowledge of these hitherto mysterious of Mohammedan superstition. In fact, El Madinah may be considered almost a virgin theme ; for as Burckhardt was prostrated by sickness throughout the period of his stay in the Northern Hejaz, he was not able to describe it as satis factorily or minutely as he did the Southern country,— he could not send a plan of the Mosque, or correct the popular but erroneous ideas which prevail concerning it and the surrounding city.

A few Words concerning what I n the autumn of 1852, through the medium of my excellent friend, the late General Monteith, I offered my services to the Royal Geographical Society of London, for the purpose of removing that opprobrium to modem adventure, the huge white blot which in our maps still notes the Eastern and the Central regions of Arabia. Sir Roderick I. Murchison, Colonel P. Yorke and Dr. Shaw, a deputation from that distinguished body, with their usual zeal for' discovery and readiness to en courage the discoverer, honoured me by warmly support ing, in a personal interview with the then Chairman of the then Court of Directors to the then Honourable East India Company, my application for three years' leave of absence on special duty from India to Maskat. But they were unable to prevail upon the said Chairman, the late Sir James Hogg, who, 1 remembering the fatalities .vhich of late years have befallen sundry soldier-travellers n the East, refused his sanction, alleging as a reason |- 'Remembering .... reason, .'much disliking, if fact must be told, my impolitic habit of elling political truths, (in 1851 I had submitted to the Court of Di- ectors certain remarks upon the subject of Anglo-Indian misrule: I2 Pilgrimage toAl-Madimh Meccah. that the contemplated journey was of too dangerous a nature. In compensation, however, for the disappoint ment, I was allowed the additional furlough of a year, in order to pursue my Arabic studies in lands where the language is best learned. What remained for me but to prove, by trial, that what might be perilous to other travellers was safe to me ? The ' experimentum crucis ' was a visit to Al-Hijaz, at once the most difficult and the most dangerous point by which a European can enter Arabia. I had intended, had the period of leave originally applied for been granted, to land at Maskat—a favourable starting-place—and there to apply myself, slowly and surely, to the task of spanning the deserts. But now I was to hurry, in the midst of summer, after a four years' sojourn in Europe, during which many things Oriental had faded away from my memory, and—after passing through the ordeal of Egypt, a country where the police is curious as in Rome or Milan—to begin with the Moslem's Holy Land, the jealously guarded and exclusive Harim. However, being liberally supplied with the means of travel by the Royal Geographical Society; thoroughly tired of ' pro gress ' and of ' civilisationcurious to see with my eyes what others are content to ' hear with ears,' namely, Moslem inner life in a really Mohammedan country; and longing, if truth be told, to set foot on that mysterious spot which no vacation tourist has yet described, mea sured, sketched and photographed, I resolved ta resume my old character of a Persian wanderer, 1 a ' Darwaysh,' and to make the attempt. need hardly say that the publication was refused with many threats), and not unwilling to mortify my supporter (his colleague, Colonel W.

By what 'Circumstance, the miscreator' my plans were a , that ( j e f ea t e (j ) the reader will discover in the course of these S ^ e t0 volumes. The secondary objects were numerous. I was . 1 -' az ' desirous to find out if any market for horses could be oin t by 0 p e ned between Central Arabia and India, where the ' studs were beginning to excite general dissatisfaction ; ranted, to 0 ^ ta j n information concerning the Great Eastern e—-and w ii^erness, the vast expanse marked Rub'a al-Khali (the . ' Empty Abode ') in our maps ; to inquire into the hydro- in the *g ra phy of the Hijaz, its water-shed, the disputed slope -urope, 0 £ C0U ntry, and the existence or non-existence of J f 0m perennial streams ; and finally, to try, by actual observa- ea P* tion, the truth of a theory proposed by Colonel W. Sykes, as m namely, that if tradition be true, in the population of the a ' vast Peninsula there must exist certain physiological wever ' differences sufficient to warrant our questioning the by the comm0 n origin of the Arab family. As regards horses, P ro ' I am satisfied that from the Eastern coast something y e y es might be done,—nothing on the Western, where the imely, a ni m als, though thorough-bred, are mere ' weeds,' of a , and foolish price and procurable only by chance. Of the erious R u b' a a i.Khali I have heard enough, from credible re- ' mea ' lators, to conclude that its horrid depths swarm with a 2SU 1 ' 1 » large and half-starving population ; that it abounds in i y , Wadys, valleys, gullies and ravines, partially fertilised by intermittent torrents; and, therefore, that the land is open to the adventurous traveller.

A fortnight was profitably spent in retting into the train of Oriental manners. For what polite Chesterfield says of the difference between a gentleman and his reverse,—namely, that both perform the same offices of life, but each in a several and widely different way—is notably as applicable to the manners of the Eastern as of the Western man. Look, for instance, at that Indian Moslem drinking a glass of water. With us the opera tion is simple enough, but his performance includes no fewer than five novelties. In the first place he clutches his tumbler as though it were the throat of a foe; secondly, he ejaculates, ' In the name of Allah the Com passionate, the Merciful!' before wetting his lips; thirdly, he imbibes the contents, swallowing them, not sipping them as he ought to do, and ending with a satisfied grunt; fourthly, before setting down the cup, he sighs forth, ' Praise be to Allah!'—of which you will under stand the full meaning in the Desert; and, fifthly, he replies, ' May Allah make it pleasant to thee!' in answer to his friend's polite ' Pleasurably and health!' Also he is careful to avoid the irreligious action of drinking the pure element in a standing position, mindful, however, of the three recognised exceptions, the fluid of the Holy Well Zemzem, water distributed in charity, and that which remains after Wuzu, the lesser ablution. More over, in Europe, where both extremities are used indis criminately, one forgets the exclusive use of the right hand, the manipulation of the rosary, the abuse of the chair—your genuine Oriental gathers up his legs, looking almost as comfortable in it as a sailor upon the back of a high-trotting horse—the rolling gait with the toes straight to the front, the grave look and the habit of pious ejacu lations.

This abhorrence of Pharaoh is, how- ever, confined to the vulgar and the religious. The philosophers and mystics of Al-Islam, in their admiration of his impious daring, make him equal, and even superior, to Moses.

Wilkinson, referring his readers to Strabo, remarks that the 'troublesome system of passports seems to have been adopted by the Egyptians at a very early period.' Its present rigours, which have lasted since the European troubles in 1848 and 1849, have a two fold object; in the first place, to act as a clog upon the dangerous emigrants which Germany, Italy, and Greece have sent out into the world; and secondly, to confine the subjects of the present Pasha of Egypt to their fatherland and the habit of paying taxes. The en lightened ruler (this was written during the rule of Abbas Pasha) knows his own interests, and never willingly parts with a subject liable to cess, at times objecting even to their obeying pilgrimage law. We, on the other hand, in India, allow a freedom of emigration, in my humble opinion, highly injurious to us. For not only does this exodus thin the population, and tend to impoverish the land, it also serves to bring our rule into disrepute in foreign lands.

Accordingly I went there, and, after sitting at least a couple of hours at the bolted door in the noon-day sun, was told, with a fury which made me think I had sinned, that the officer in whose charge the department was, had been presented with an olive branch in the morning, and consequently that business was not to be done that day. The angry-faced official communicated the intelligence to a large group of Anado- lian, Caramanian, Bosniac, and Roumelian Turks,— sturdy, undersized, broad-shouldered, bare-legged, splay footed, horny-fisted, dark-browed, honest-looking moun taineers, who were lounging about with long pistols and yataghans stuck in their broad sashes, head-gear com posed of immense tarbushes with proportionate turbands coiled round them, and bearing two or three suits of sub stantial clothes, even at this season of the year, upon their shoulders. Like myself they had waited some hours, but they were not so patient under disappointment: they bluntly told the angry official that he and his master were a pair of idlers, and the curses that rumbled and gurgled in their hairy throats as they strode towards the door sounded like the growling of wild beasts. Thus was another day truly orientally lost. On the morrow, however, I obtained permission, in the character of Dr. Abdullah, to visit any part of Egypt I pleased, and to retain possession of my dagger and pistols.

But to pass through the Moslem's Holy Land, you must either be a born believer, or have become one; in the former case you may demean yourself as you please, in the latter a path is ready pre pared for you. My spirit could not bend to own myself a Burma, 1 a renegade—to be pointed at and shunned and catechised, an object of suspicion to the many and of contempt to all. Moreover, it would have obstructed the aim of my wanderings. The convert is always watched with Argus eyes, and men do not willingly give information to a 'new Moslem,' especially a Frank: they suspect his conversion to be feigned or forced, look upon him as a spy, and let him see as little of life as possible. Firmly as was my heart set upon travelling in Arabia, by Heaven! I would have given up the dear project rather than purchase a doubtful and partial success at such a price. Consequently, I had no choice but to appear as a born believer, and part of my birthright in that respectable character was toil and trouble in obtain ing a Tazkirah. 2 Then I had to provide myself with certain neces saries for the way. These were not numerous. The silver-mounted dressing-bag is here supplied by a rag containing a Miswak 3 or tooth-stick, a bit of soap and a comb, wooden, for bone and tortoiseshell are not, re ligiously speaking, correct. Equally simple was my ward- 'T An opprobrious name given by the Turks to their Christian converts. The word is derived from to twist, to turn.' 2 During my journey, and since my return, some Indian papers conducted by jocose editors made merry upon an Englishman ' turn ing Turk.' Once for all, I beg leave to point above for the facts of the case; it must serve as a general answer to any pleasant little fictions which may hereafter appear. 3 A stick of soft wood chewed at one end. It is generally used throughout the East, where brushes should be avoided, as the natives always suspect hogs' bristles.24 Pilgrimage toAl-Madimh Meccah. robe; a change or two of clothing. It is a great mistake to carry too few clothes, and those who travel as Orientals should always have at least one very grand suit for use on ciitical occasions. Throughout the East a badly dressed man is a pauper, and, as in England, a pauper—unless he belongs to an order having a right to be poor—is a scoundrel. The only article of canteen description was a Zemzemiyah, a goat-skin water-bag, which, especially when new, communicates to its contents a ferruginous aspect and a wholesome, though hardly an attractive, flavour of tanno-gelatine. This was a necessary; to drink out of a tumbler, possibly fresh from pig-eating lips, would have entailed a certain loss of reputation. For bedding and furniture I had a coarse Persian rug which, besides being couch, acted as chair, table, and oratory a cotton-stuffed chintz-covered pillow, a blanket in case of cold, and a sheet, which did duty for tent and mosquito curtains in nights of heat. 1 As shade is a con venience not always procurable, another necessary was a huge cotton umbrella of Eastern make, brightly yellow, suggesting the idea of an overgrown marigold. I had also a substantial housewife, the gift of a kind relative, Miss Elizabeth Stisted ; it was a roll of canvas, carefully soiled, and garnished with needles and thread, cobblers' wax, buttons, and other such articles. These things were most useful in lands where tailors abound not; besides which, the sight of a man darning his coat or patching his slippers teems with pleasing ideas of umi ^y- A dagger, 2 a brass inks tand and pen-holder 1 Almost all Easterns sleep under a sheet, which becomes a kind 0 5!l pir fl r : i m ^ hem from the dews and mosquitoes by night and the flies by day.

The great inconvenience of the belt is its weight, especially where dollars must be carried, as in Arabia, causing chafes and discomfort at night. Moreover, it can scarcely be called safe. In dangerous countries wary travellers will adopt surer precautions. 1 A pair of common native Khurjin, or saddle-bags, contained my wardrobe; the bed was readily rolled up into a bundle; and for a medicine chest 2 I bought a pea- green box with red and yellow flowers, capable of stand ing falls from a camel twice a day. 1 Some prefer a long chain of pure gold divided into links and covered with leather, so as to resemble the twisted girdle which the Arab fastens round his waist. It is a precaution well known to the wandering knights of old. Others, again, in very critical situations, open with a lancet the shoulder, or any other fleshy part of the body, and insert a precious stone, which does not show in its novel purse. 2 Any ^ Companion to the Medicine Chest' will give, to those that require such information, the names of drugs and instruments necessary for a journey ; but it must be borne in mind that hot coun tries require double quantities of tonics, and half the allowance of cathartics necessary in cold climates. Sonnini, however, is right when he says of the Egyptian fellahs, that their stomachs, accustomed to digest bread badly baked, acrid and raw vegetables, and other green and unwholesome nourishment, require doses fit only for horses. Advisable precautions are, in the first place, to avoid, if travelling as a native, any signs of European manufacture in knives, scissors, weights, scales and other such articles. Secondly, glass bottles are useless : the drugs should be stowed away in tin or wooden boxes, such as the natives of the country use, and when a phial is required, it must be fitted into an etui of some kind. By this means, ground glass stoppers and plentiful cotton stuffing, the most volatile essences may be carried about without great waste. After six montiis of the driest heat, in Egypt and Arabia, not more than about one- fourth of my Prussic acid and chloroform had evaporated. And, thirdly, if you travel in the East, a few bottles of tincture of canthar- ides—highly useful as a rubefacient, excitant, et cetera—must never be omitted. I made the mistake of buying my drugs in England, and had the useless trouble of looking after them during the journey. Both at Alexandria and Cairo they are to be found in abundance, cheaper than in London, and good enough for all practical purposes. .II.— I Leave 27 The next step was to find out when the local steamer would start for Cairo, and accordingly I betook myself to the Transit Office. No vessel was advertised ; I was di rected to call every evening till satisfied. At last the fortunate event took place: a 'weekly departure,' which, by the bye, occurred once every fortnight or so, was in orders for the next day. I hurried to the office, but did not reach it till past noon—the hour of idleness. A little, dark gentleman—Mr. Green—so formed and dressed as exactly to resemble a liver-and-tan bull-terrier, who with his heels on the table was dosing, cigar in mouth, over the last ' Galignani,' positively refused, after a time,— for at first he would not speak at all,—to let me take my passage till three in the afternoon. I inquired when the boat started, upon which he referred me, as I had spoken bad Italian, to the advertisement. I pleaded inability to read or write, whereupon he testily cried nove ! —at nine! at nine ! Still appearing uncertain, I drove him out of his chair, when he rose with a curse and read 8 a.m. An unhappy Eastern, depending upon what he said, would have been precisely one hour too late. Thus were we lapsing into the real good old East- Indian style of doing business. Thus Anglo-Indicus orders his first clerk to execute some commission ; the senior, having 'work' upon his hands, sends a junior; the junior finds the sun hot, and passes on the word to a 'peon;' the 'peon' charges a porter with the errand; and the porter quietly sits or doses in his place, trusting that Fate will bring him out of the scrape, but firmly resolved, though the shattered globe fall, not to stir an inch. The reader, I must again express a hope, will pardon the length of these descriptions,—my object is to show him how business is carried on in these hot countries. Business generally. For had I been, not Abdullah the Darwaysh, but a rich native merchant, it would have been28 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah the same. How many complaints of similar treatment have I heard in different parts of the Eastern world! and how little can one realise them without having actually experienced the evil! For the future I shall never see a ' nigger ' squatting away half a dozen mortal hours in a broiling sun patiently waiting for something or for some one, without a lively remembrance of my own cooling of the calces at the custom-house of Alexandria. At length, about the end of May (1853) all was ready. ike nile Not without a feeling of regret I left my little room among the white myrtle blossoms and the rosy oleander In tlie flowers with the almond smell.

I n the days of the Pitts we have invariably a ' Re lation ' of Egyptian travellers who embark for a place called ' Roseet' on the ' River Nilus.' Wanderers of the Brucean age were wont to record their impressions of voyage upon land subjects observed between Alexandria and Cairo. A little later we find every one inditing rhapsodies about, and descriptions of, his or her Daha- biyah (barge) on the canal. After this came the steamer. And after the steamer will come the railroad, which may disappoint the author tourist, but will be delightful to that sensible class of men who wish to get over the greatest extent of ground with the least inconvenience to themselves and others. Then shall the Mahmudiyah— ugliest and most wearisome of canals—be given up to cotton boats and grain barges, and then will note-books and the headings of chapters clean ignore its existence. I saw the canal at its worst, when the water was low; and I have not one syllable to say in its favour. Instead of thirty hours, we took three mortal days and nights to reach Cairo, and we grounded with painful regularity four or five times between sunrise and sunset. In the scenery on the banks sketchers and describers have left you nought to see. From Pompey's Pillar to the Maison Carree, Kariom and its potteries, Al-Birkah 1 of the night birds, Bastarah i Villages notorious for the peculiar Egyptian revelry, an un doubted relic of the good old times, when ' the most religious of30 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. with the alleys of trees, even unto Atfah, all things are CepM perfectly familiar to us, and have been so years before Qijin of the the traveller actually sees them.

To me there was double dulness in the scenery: it seemed to be Sind over again—the same morning mist and noon-tide glare ; the same hot wind and heat clouds, and fiery sunset, and evening glow; the same pillars of dust and ' devils ' of sand sweeping like giants over the plain ; the same turbid waters of a broad, shallow stream studded with sand-banks and silt-isles, with crashing earth slips and ruins nodding over a kind of cliff, whose base the stream gnaws with noisy tooth. On the banks, saline ground sparkled and glittered like hoar-frost in the sun; and here and there mud villages, solitary huts, pigeon-towers, or watch turrets, whence little brown boys shouted and slung stones at the birds, peeped out from among bright green patches of palm-tree, tamarisk, and mimosa, of maize, tobacco, and sugar-cane. Beyond the narrow tongue of land on the river banks lay the glaring, yellow Desert, with its low hills and sand slopes, bounded by innumerable pyramids of Nature's architecture. The boats, with their sharp bows, preposterous sterns, and lateen sails, might have belonged to the Indus. So might the chocolate-skinned, blue-robed peasantry; the women carrying progeny on their hips, with the eternal waterpot on their heads; and the men sleeping in the shade or following the plough, to which probably Osiris first put hand. The lower ^.nimals, like the higher, were the same; gaunt, mange-stained camels, muddy buffaloes, scurvied donkeys, sneaking jackals, and fox-like dogs. Even the feathered creatures were perfectly familiar to my eye— it is a calamity, an 'enormous, cruel wonder,' more crushing to the \ people than were the pyramids and sphinxes of old.32 Pilgrimage to Al -Madinah Meccah. paddy birds, pelicans, giant cranes, kites and wild water fowl. I had taken a third-class or deck-passage, whereby the evils of the journey were exasperated. A roasting sun pierced the canvas awning like hot water through a gauze veil, and by night the cold dews fell raw and thick as a Scotch mist. The cooking was abominable, and the dig nity of Darwaysh-hood did not allow me to sit at meat with Infidels or to eat the food which they had polluted. So the Pilgrim squatted apart, smoking perpetually, with occasional interruptions to say his prayers and to tell his beads upon the mighty rosary; and he drank the muddy water of the canal out of a leathern bucket, and he munched his bread and garlic 1 with a desperate sancti moniousness. The ' Little Asthmatic' was densely crowded, and discipline not daring to mark out particular places, the scene on board of her was motley enough. There were two Indian officers, who naturally spoke to none but each other, drank bad tea, and smoked their cigars exclusively i Those skilled in simples, Eastern as well as Western, praise garlic highly, declaring that it 'strengthens the body, prepares the constitution for fatigue, brightens the sight, and, by increasing the digestive power, obviates the ill-effects arising from sudden change of air and water.' The traveller inserts it into his dietary in some pleasant form, as 'Provence-butter,' because he observes that, wherever fever and ague abound, the people, ignorant of cause but observant of effect, make it a common article of food. The old Egyptians highly esteemed this vegetable, which, with onions and leeks, enters into the list of articles so much regretted by the Hebrews (Numbers, xi. 5; .Koran, chap. 2). The modern people of the Nile, ' Ijjiin, like the Spaniards, delight in onions, which, as they contain between 25 and 30 per cent, of gluten, are highly nutritive. In Arabia, how ever, the stranger must use this vegetable sparingly. The city people despise it as the food of a Fellah—a boor. The Wahhabis have a pre- VftiW judice against onions, leeks, and garlic, because the Prophet disliked their strong smell, and all strict Moslems refuse to eat them im mediately before visiting the mosque, or meeting for public prayer. IIII.—The Nile Steamboat—The ' 33 like Britons. A troop of the Kurd Kawwas, 1 escorting treasure, was surrounded by a group of noisy Greeks; these mens gross practical jokes sounding anything but plea sant to the solemn Moslems, whose saddle-bags and furniture were at every moment in danger of being de filed by abominable drinks and the ejected juices of tobacco. There was one pretty woman on board, a Spamsh girl who looked strangely misplaced-a rose in a field of thistles. Some silent Italians, with noisy inter preters, sat staidly upon the benches. It was soon found out, through the communicative dragoman, that their business was to buy horses for H. M. of Sardinia : thev were exposed to a volley of questions delivered by a party of French tradesmen returning to Cairo, but they shielded themselves and fought shy with Machiavellian dexterity. Besides these was a German, a ' beer-bottle in the morning and a bottle of beer in the evening,' to borrow a simile from his own nation; a Syrian merchant, the richest and ug liest of Alexandria; and a few French house-painters going to decorate the Pasha's palace at Shubra. These last were the happiest of our voyagers,—veritable children of Fans, Montagnards, Voltaireans,and thoroughbred Sans- Soucis. All day they sat upon deck chattering as only their lively nation can chatter, indulging in ultra-gallic maxims, such as ' on ne vieillit jam now play ing ecarte for love or nothing, then composing ' des ches un pen chiques now reciting adventures of the category ' Mirabolant,' then singing, then dancing, then sleeping, and rising to play, to drink, talk, dance, and sing again. One chaunted; 'Jen'ai pas connu mon pere Ce respectable vieillard. J e suis ne trois ans trop tard,' &amp;c.; Whilst another trolled out: ' Qu'est ce que je vois ? canard en r6be de chambre !' 1 A policeman; see Chap. I. '34 Pilgrimage to Al-Madi Theybeing new comers, free from the western woygw so soon caught by Oriental Europeans, were particularly civil to me, even wishing to mix me a strong draught; but I was not so fortunate with all on board. A large shopkeeper threatened to ' iriser ' my 'fi ' for putting my pipe near his pantaloons; but seeing me finger my dagger curiously, though I did not shift my pipe, he forgot to remember his threat. I had taken charge of a parcel for one M. P , a student of Coptic, and remitted it to him on board ; of this little service the only acknowledg ment was a stare and a petulant inquiry why I had not given it to him before. And one of the Englishmen, half publicly, half privily, as though communing with himself, condemned my organs of vision because I happened to touch his elbow. He was a man in my own service; I pardoned him in consideration of the compliment paid to my disguise. Two fellow-passengers were destined to play an im portant part in my comedy of Cairo. Just after we had started, a little event afforded us some amusement. On the bank appeared a short, crummy, pursy kind of man, whose efforts to board the steamer were notably ridiculous. With attention divided between the vessel and a carpet-bag carried by his donkey boy, he ran along the sides of the canal, now stumbling into hollows, then climbing heights, then standing shouting upon the projections with the fierce sun upon his back, till everyone thought his breati was completely gone. But no! game to the backbone, he would have perished miserably rather than lose his fare : ' patience and perseverance,' say the wise, ' got a wife for his Reverence.' At last he was taken on board, and presently he lay down to sleep.

When he awoke he introduced himself to me as Miyan Khudabakhsh Namdar, a native of Lahore : he had carried on the trade of a shawl merchant in London and Paris, where he had lived two years, and, after a pilgrimage intended to purge away the sins of civilised lands, he had settled at Cairo. My second friend, Haji Wali, I will introduce to the reader in a future chapter; and my two expeditions to Midian have brought him once more into notice. 1 Long conversations in Persian and Hindustani abridged the tediousness of the voyage, and when we arrived at Bulak, the polite Khudabakhsh insisted upon my making his house my home. I was unwilling to accept the man's civility, disliking his looks; but he ad vanced cogent reasons for changing my mind. His servant cleared my luggage through the custom-house, and a few minutes after our arrival I found myself in his abode near the Azbakiyah Gardens, sitting in a cool Mashrabiyah 2 that gracefully projected over a garden, and sipping the favourite glass of pomegranate syrup. As the Wakalahs or Caravanserais were at that time full of pilgrims, I remained with Khudabakhsh ten days or a fortnight. But at the end of that time my patience was thoroughly exhausted. My host had become a civilised man, who sat on chairs, who ate with a fork, who talked European politics, and who had learned to admire, if not to understand, liberty—liberal ideas ! and was I not flying from such things ? Besides which, we English have a 1 See ' The Gold Mines of Midian,' and ' The Land of Midian (Revisited),' by Sir R. F.

Observing our solitary habits, that we could not, and would not, sit and talk and sip sherbet and smoke with them, they called us ' Jangli '— wild men, fresh caught in the jungle and sent to rule over the land of Hind. 1 Certainly nothing suits us less than perpetual society, an utter want of solitude, when one cannot retire into oneself an instant without being asked some puerile question by a companion, or look into a book without a servant peering over one's shoulder; when from the hour you rise to the time you rest, you must ever be talking or listening, you must converse yourself to sleep in a public dormitory, and give ear to your com panions' snores and mutterings at midnight. 2 The very essence of Oriental hospitality, however, is this family style of reception, which costs your host neither coin nor trouble. I speak of the rare tracts in which the old barbarous hospitality still lingers. You make one more at his eating tray, and an additional mattress appears in the sleeping-room. When you depart, you leave if you like a little present, merely for a memo rial, with your entertainer; he would be offended if you offered it him openly as a remuneration, and you give 1 Caste in India arises from the peculiarly sociable nature of the native mind, for which reason ' it is found existing among sects whose creeds are as different and as opposite as those of the Hindu and the Christian.' (B. A. Irving's Prize Essay on the Theory and Practice of Caste.) Hence, nothing can be more terrible to a man than expulsion from caste; the excommunication of our feudal times was not a more dreadful form of living death. 2 With us every man's house is his castle. But caste divides a people into huge families, each member of which has a right to know everything about his •'caste-brother,' because a whole body might be polluted and degraded by the act of an individual. Hence, there is no such thing as domestic privacy, and no system of espionnage de vised by rulers could be so complete as that self-imposed bv the Hindus.I III. — The Nile Steamboat — 37 leir some trifling sums to the servants. Thus you will be ^ welcome wherever you go. If perchance you are detained lt . s ' perforce in such a situation,—which may easily happen S1 P to you, medical man,—you have only to make yourself as disagreeable as possible, by calling for all manner of ver impossible things. Shame is a passion with Eastern lan nations. Your host would blush to point out to you the 3ne indecorum of your conduct; and the laws of hospitality oblige him to supply the every want of a guest, even though he be a detenu. ien But of all Orientals, the most antipathetical com- ust panion to an Englishman is, I believe, an East-Indian. Like ;e lf the fox in the fable, fulsomely flattering at first, he grad- ually becomes easily friendly, disagreeably familiar, offensively rude, which ends by rousing the ' spirit of the er, British lion.' Nothing delights the Hindi so much as ost an opportunity of safely venting the spleen with which he m regards his victors. 1 He will sit in the presence of a 'ou ia ^ 1 The Calcutta Review (No. 41), noticing ' L'Inde sous la Domi- rt, nation Anglaise,' by the Baron Barchou de Penhoen, delivers the 10- following sentiment: ' Whoever states, as the Baron B. de P. states . ou and repeats, again and again, that the natives generally entertain a bad opinion of the Europeans generally, states what is decidedly ve untrue.' The reader will observe that I differ as decidedly from the the Reviewer's opinion. Popular feeling towards the English in India cts was ' at first one of fear, afterwards of horror: Hindus and Hindis idu (Moslems) considered the strangers a set of cow-eaters and fire- md drinkers, tttrae beluas ac molossis suis ferociores, who would fight like tan Iblis, cheat their own fathers, and exchange with the same readiness les a broadside of shots and thrusts of boarding-pikes, or a bale of goods and a bag of rupees.'

We have risen in a degree above such a low standard of ow estimation ; still, incredible as it may appear to the Frank himself, ;ht it is no less true, that the Frank everywhere in the East is con- ire sidered a contemptible being, and dangerous withal.

But after leaving the room, he is as different from his former self as a counsel in court from a counsel at a concert, a sea captain at a club dinner from a sea captain on his quarter-deck. Then he will discover that the English are not brave, nor clever, nor generous, nor civilised, nor anything but surpassing rogues; that every official takes bribes, that their manners are utterly offensive, and that they are rank infidels. Then he will descant complacently upon the probability of a general Bartholomew's Day in the East, and look forward to the hour when enlightened Young India will arise and drive the ' foul invader ' from the land. 1 Then he will submit his political opinions nakedly, that India should be wrested from the Company and given to the Queen, or taken from the Queen and given to the French. If the Indian has been a European traveller, so much the worse for you. He has blushed to own,—explaining, however, conquest by bribery,—that 50,000 Englishmen hold 150,000,000 of his compatriots in thrall, and for aught you know, republicanism may have become his idol. He has lost all fear of the white face, and having been accus tomed to unburden his mind in ' The land where, girt by friend or foe, A man may say the thing he will,'— he pursues the same course in other lands where it is exceedingly misplaced.

And how can we hope it to be otherwise,—we, a nation of strangers, aliens to the country's cus toms and creed, who, even while resident in India, act the part which absentees do in other lands ?

Even the experiment of associating with them is almost too hard to bear. But a useful deduction may be drawn from such observations ; and as few have had greater experience than myself, I venture to express my opinion with confidence, however unpopular or un fashionable it may be. I am convinced that the natives of India cannot respect a European who mixes with them familiarly, or especially who imitates their customs, manners, and dress. The tight pantaloons, the authoritative voice, the pococurante manner, and the broken Hindustani impose upon them have a weight which learning and honesty, which wit and courage, have not. This is to them the master's attitude: they bend to it like those Scythian slaves that faced the sword but fled from the horsewhip. Such would never be the case amongst a brave people, the Afghan for instance; and for the same reason it is not so, we read, with 'White Plume,' the North American Indian. ' The free trapper combines in the eye of an In dian (American) girl, all that is dashing and heroic in a warrior of her own race, whose gait and garb and bravery he emulates, with all that is gallant and glorious in the white man.' There is but one cause for this phenome non , the imbelles Indi' are still, with few exceptions, 1 a cowardly and slavish people, who would raise them selves by depreciating those superior to them in the scale of creation.

T he ' Wakalah,' as the Caravanserai or Khan is called in Egypt, combines the offices of hotel, lodging- house, and store. It is at Cairo, as at Constantinople, a massive pile of buildings surrounding a quadrangular ' Hosh ' or court-yard. On the ground-floor are rooms like caverns for merchandise, and shops of different kinds —tailors, cobblers, bakers, tobacconists, fruiterers, and others. A roofless gallery or a covered verandah, into which all the apartments open, runs round the first and sometimes the second story: the latter, however, is usually exposed to the sun and wind. The accommoda tions consist of sets of two or three rooms, generally an inner one and an outer; the latter contains a hearth for cook ing, a bathing-place, and similar necessaries. The stair cases are high, narrow, and exceedingly dirty; dark at night, and often in bad repair; a goat or donkey is tethered upon the different landings ; here and there a fresh skin is stretched in process of tanning, and the smell reminds the veteran traveller of those closets in the old French vapourers (bombastic Babus, and other such political ranters), should learn that the sacred spark of patriotism is exotic here, and can never fall on a mine that can explode; for history will show them that certain peculiarities of physical, as well as moral organi sation, neither to be strengthened by diet nor improved by educa tion, have hitherto prevented their ever attempting a national inde pendence ; which will continue to exist to them but as a name, and as an offscouring of college declamations.' 142 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah Mcccah. inns where cat used to be prepared for playing the part rat^ of jugged hare.

Originally from Russia, he also had been a traveller, and in his wanderings he had cast off most of the prejudices of his people. ' I believe in Allah and his Prophet, and in nothing else,' was his sturdy creed; he rejected alchemy, jinnis and magicians, and truly he had a most unoriental distaste for tales of wonder. When I entered the Wakalah, he constituted himself my cicerone, and especially guarded me against the cheating of trades men. By his advice I laid aside the Darwaysh's gown, the large blue pantaloons, and the short shirt; in fact all con nection with Persia and the Persians.

He soon explained his affairs to me, and fastings, as his case brought out certain Oriental peculiarities in a sending t striking light, with his permission I offer a few of its matchles: details. dispose 1 My friend was defendant in a suit instituted against British p him in H.B.M.'s Consular Court, Cairo, by one Mohammed Pres Shafi'a, a scoundrel of the first water. This man lived, worthy I and lived well, by setting up in business at places where metchanl his name was not known ; he enticed the unwary by ingsopo artful displays of capital; and, after succeeding in up his s getting credit, he changed residence, carrying off all he quarrels could lay hands upon. But swindling is a profession aniiclain of personal danger in uncivilised countries, where law pretensio punishes pauper debtors by a short imprisonment; ready to and where the cheated prefer to gratify their revenge sealed, a: by the cudgel or the knife. So Mohammed Shafi'a, his book: after a few narrow escapes, hit upon a prime ex- can pro) pedient. Though known to be a native of Bokhara—he therefore actually signed himself so in his letters, and his appear- from the ance at once bespoke his origin,—he determined to protect himself by a British passport.

To recount all his Reynardisms would weary the reader ; suffice it to say that by proper management of the subalterns in the consulate, he succeeded without ruining himself. Armed with this new defence, he started boldly for Jeddah on the Arabian coast. Having entered into partnership with Haji Wali, whose confidence ,he had won by prayers, fastings, and pilgrimages, he openly trafficked in slaves, sending them to Alexandria for sale, and writing with matchless impudence to his correspondent that he would dispose of them in person, but for fear of losing his British passport and protection. Presently an unlucky adventure embroiled this worthy British subject with Faraj Yusuf, the principal merchant of Jeddah, and also an English protege. Fear ing so powerful an adversary, Mohammed Shafi'a packed up his spoils and departed for Egypt. Presently he quarrels with his former partner, thinking him a soft man, and claims from him a debt of ^165. He supports his pretensions by a document and four witnesses, who are ready to swear that the receipt in question was ' signed, sealed, and delivered' by Haji Wali. The latter adduces his books to show that accounts have been settled, and can prove that the witnesses in question are paupers, therefore, not legal; moreover, that each has received from the plaintiff two dollars, the price of perjury. subjects or servants. This they made profitable; for their claims, however exorbitant, when backed by a name of fear, were certain to be admitted, unless the Resident's conscience would allow of his being persuaded by weightier arguments of a similar nature to aban don his protege. It is almost needless to remark that nothing of the kind can occur in the present day, and at the same time that throughout the Eastern world it is firmly believed that such things are of daily occurrence. Ill fame descends to distant generations; whilst good deeds, if they blossom, as we are told, in the dust, are at least as short-lived as they are sweet.48 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. Now had such a suit been carried into a Turkish court of justice, it would very sensibly have been settled by the bastinado, for Haji Wali was a respectable mar chant, and Mohammed Shafi'a a notorious swindler. Bui the latter was a British subject, which notably influenced the question. The more to annoy his adversary, he wenl up to Cairo, and began proceedings there, hoping by thij acute step to receive part payment of his demand. Arrived at Cairo, Mohammed Shafi'a applied himsel stoutly to the task of bribing all who could be useful t( him, distributing shawls and piastres with great generosity He secured the services of an efficient lawyer; and, de termining to enlist heaven itself in his cause, he passec the Ramazan ostentatiously; he fasted, and he slaughters sheep to feed the poor. Meanwhile Haji Wali, a simple truth-telling man who could never master the rudiments of that art whicl teaches man to blow hot and to blow cold with the sami breath, had been persuaded to visit Cairo by Khuda bakhsh, the wily Indian, who promised to introduce hin to influential persons, and to receive him in his hous till he could provide himself with a lodging at the Wak alah. But Mohammed Shafi'a, who had once been ii partnership with the Indian, and who possibly knew mor than was fit to meet the public ear, found this out; and, parti by begging, partly by bullying, persuaded Khudabakhs to transfer the influential introductions to himself.

And all the Indians affix their seals &gt; this paper. Then Mohammed Shafi'a threatens to waylay and to beat the Haji. The Haji, not loud or hector- igly, but with a composed smile, advises his friends to old him off. One would suppose that such a document would have iicited some inquiry. But Haji Wali was a Persian protege, and proceed- igs between the Consulates had commenced before the etition was presented. The pseudo-British subject, hav- ig been acknowledged as a real one, must be supported. Consuls, like kings, may err, but must not own to error fo notice was taken of the Indian petition; worse still, o inquiry into the slave-affair was set on foot 1 ; and it was iscovered that the passport having been granted by a Consul-General could not with official etiquette be resumed y a Consul. 2 1 It may be as well to remark that our slave laws require reform iroughout the East, their severity, like Draco's Code, defeating their irpose. In Egypt, for instance, they require modification. Con- itute the offence a misdemeanour, not a felony, inflict a fine (say ioo),half of which should be given to the informer, and make the im- risonment either a short one, or, what would be better still, let it be done vay with, except in cases of non-payment; and finally, let the Consul • some other magistrate residing at the place have power to inflict te penalty of the law, instead of being obliged, as at present, to ansmit offenders to Malta for trial. As the law now stands, our ficials are unwilling to carry its rigours into effect; they therefore isily lend an ear to the standard excuse—ignorance—in order to ave an opportunity of decently dismissing a man, with a warning Dt to do it again. 2 Yet at the time there was at Alexandria an acting Consul-Gene- il, to whom the case could with strict propriety have been referred. OL. I* a5° Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. Thus matters were destined to proceed as they began. Mohammed Shafi'a had offered 5,000 piastres to the Persian Consul's interpreter; this of course was refused, but still somehow or other all the Haji's affairs seemed to go wrong. His statements were mistranslated, his accounts were misunderstood, and the suit was allowed to drag on to a suspicious length. When I left Cairo ii July, Haji Wali had been kept away nearly two months from his business and family, though both parties—for the plaintiff's purse was rapidly thinning—appeared eager to settle the difference by arbitration : when I returned from Arabia in October, matters were almost qw ante, and when I started for India in January, the pro ceedings had not closed. Such is a brief history, but too common, of a case in which the subject of an Eastern state has to contend against British influence. It is doubtless a point of hon our to defend our prot6ges from injustice, but the higher principle should rest upon the base of common honesty. The worst part of such a case is, that the injured party has no redress. ' Fiat wtjustitia, ruat ccelum,' is the motto of his 'natural protectors,' who would vio late every law to gratify the false pride of a petty English official. And, saving the rare exceptions where rank or wealth command consideration, with what face, to use tie native phrase, would a hapless Turk appeal to the higher powers, our ministers or our Parliament ? After lodging myself in the Wakalah, my first object was to make a certain stir in the world.

The traveller who, on the banks of the Seine, scoffs at Sights and Sounds, Table-turning and Spirit-rapping, sees in the wilds of Tartary and Thibet a something supernatural and diabolical in the bungling Sie-fa of the Bokte. 1 Some sensible men, who pass for philosophers among their friends, have been caught by the incantations of the turbanded and bearded Cairo magi cian. In our West African colonies the phrase 'growing black' was applied to colonists, who, after a term of residence, became thoroughly imbued with the supersti tions of the land. And there are not wanting old Anglo- Indians, intelligent men, that place firm trust in tales and tenets too puerile even for the Hindus to believe. As a ' Hindi' I could use animal magnetism, taking care, however, to give the science a specious supernatural ap pearance. Haji Wali, who, professing positive scepticism, showed the greatest interest in the subject as a curiosity, advised me not to practise pure mesmerism; otherwise, that I should infallibly become a ' Companion of Devils.' 'You must call this an Indian secret,' said my friend, ' for it is clear that you are no Mashaikh, 2 and people will ask, where are your drugs, and what business have you with charms ?' It is useless to say that I followed his counsel; yet patients would consider themselves my 1 Certain Lamas who, we learn from M.

Most effectual gag to Cupid's eloquence! Yet was not the plain-spoken Maryam's reply without its moral. How often is it our fate, in the West as in the East, to see in bright eyes and to hear from rosy lips an implied, if not an expressed, ' Why don't you buy me ?' or, worse still, ' Why can't you buy me ?' All I required in return for my services from the slave-dealer, whose brutal countenance and manners were truly repugnant, was to take me about the town, and ex plain to me certain mysteries in his craft, which know ledge might be useful in time to come. Little did he sus pect who his interrogator was, and freely in his un- suspiciousness he entered upon the subject of slave hunting in the Somali country, and Zanzibar, of all things the most interesting to me. I have, however, nothing new to report concerning the present state of bondsmen in Egypt. England has already learned that slaves are not neces sarily the most wretched and degraded of men. Some have been bold enough to tell the British public that, in the generality of Oriental countries, 1 the serf fares far i In the generality, not in all. Nothing, for instance, can be more disgraceful to human nature than the state of prsedial slavery, or serfs attached to the glebe, when Malabar was under the dominion of the mild Hindu. And as a rule in the Sast it is only the domestic slaves who taste the sweets of slavery. Yet there is truth in Sonnini's terrible remark: 'The severe treatment under which the slaves languish in the West Indies is the shameful pre rogative of civilisation, and is unknown to those nations among whom barbarism is reported to hold sway.' (Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt, vol. ii.)IV.— Life 61 )n 1 you better than the servant, or indeed than the poorer orders of freemen. ' The laws of Mahomet enjoin his followers to form to treat slaves w ith the greatest mildness, and the Mos lems are in general scrupulous observers of the Apostle's recommendation.

The list of nons was necessarily rather an extensive one,—good health and a readiness to travel anywhere, a little skill in cooking, sewing and washing, willingness to fight, and a habit of regular prayers. After a day's delay the Shaykh brought me a specimen of his choosing, a broad-shouldered, bandy legged fellow, with the usual bull-dog expression of the Berberis, in his case rendered doubly expressive by the drooping of an eyelid—an accident brought about with acrid juice in order to avoid conscription. He responded sturdily to all my questions. Some Egyptian donkey boys and men were making a noise in the room at the time, and the calm ferocity with which he ejected them commanded my approval. When a needle, thread, and an unhemmed napkin were handed to him, he sat down, held the edge of the cloth between his big toe and its neighbour, and finished the work in quite a superior style. Walking out, he armed himself with a Kurbaj, which he used, now lightly, then heavily, upon all laden animals, biped and quadruped, that came in the way.

I will relate the origin of the saying, &gt;tered as I heard it differently, from Mansfield Parkyns, (Life in Abyssinia, tres a chap. 31.)

The first and best is the well-known Latakia, generally called M Jabali,' either from a small seaport town about three hours' journey south of Latakia, or more probably because grown on the hills near the ancient Laodicea. Pure, it is known by its blackish colour, fine shredding, absence of stalk, and an undescribable odour, to me resembling that of creosote; the leaf, too, is small, so that when made into cigars it must be covered over with a slip of the yellow Turkish tobacco called Bafra. Except at the highest houses un adulterated Latakia is not to be had in Cairo. Yet, mixed as it is, no other growth exceeds it in flavour and fragrance. Miss Martineau smoked it, we are told, without inconvenience, and it differs from our Shag, Bird's-eye, and Returns, in degree, as does Chateau Margeau from a bottle of cheap strong Spanish wine. To bring out its flavour, the connoisseur smokes it in long pipes of cherry, jasmine, maple, or rosewood, and these require a servant skilled in the arts of cleaning and filling them. The best Jabali at Cairo costs about seven piastres the pound; after which a small sum must be paid to the Farram or chopper, who prepares it for use. 2nd. Suri (Tyrian), or Shami, or Suryani, grown in Syria, an inferior growth, of a lighter colour than Latakia, and with a greenish tinge; when cut, its value is about three piastres per pound. Some smokers mix this leaf with Jabali, which, to my taste, spoils the flavour of the latter without improving the former. The strongest kind, called VOL.

I thought it right to conform to popular custom, and accord ingly, after having secured a servant, my efforts were directed to finding a teacher; the pretext being that as an Indian doctor I wanted to read Arabic works on medi cine, as well as to perfect myself in divinity and pro nunciation. 5 My theological studies were in the Shafe'i school for two reasons : in the first place, it is the least rigorous of the Four Orthodox, and, secondly, it most resembles the Shi'ah heresy, with which long intercourse Korani or Jabayl, is generally used for cigarettes; it costs, when of first-rate quality, about five piastres per pound. 3rd. Tumbak, or Persian tobacco, called Hijazi, because im ported from the Hijaz, where everybody smokes it, and supposed to come from Shiraz, Kazerun, and other celebrated places in Persia. It is all but impossible to buy this article unadulterated, except from the caravans returning after the pilgrimage. The Egyptians mix it with native growths, which ruins its flavour and gives it an acridity that 14 catches the throat,' whereas good tumbak never yet made a man cough. Yet the taste of this tobacco, even when second-rate, is so fascinating to some smokers that they will use no other. To be used it should be wetted and squeezed, and it is invariably inhaled through water into the lungs: almost every town has its favourite description of pipe, and these are of all kinds, from the pauper's rough cocoa-nut mounted with two reeds, to the prince's golden bowl set with the finest stones. Tumbak is cheap, costing about four piastres a pound, but large quantities of it are used. 4th. Hummi, as the word signifies, a ''hot' 1 variety of the tum bak, grown in Al-Yaman and other countries. It is placed in the tile on the buri or cocoa-nut pipe, unwetted, and has a very acrid flavour. Being supposed to produce intoxication, or rather a swimming in the head, hummi gives its votaries a bad name: respectable men would answer ' no' with rage if asked whether they are smoking it, and when a fellow tells you that he has seen better days, but that now he smokes Hummi in a buri, you understand him that his misfortunes have affected either his brain or his morality. Hence it is that this tobacco is never put into pipes intended for smoking the other kinds. The price of Hummi is about five piastres per pound. 1 A study essential to the learned, as in some particular portions of the Koran a mispronunciation becomes a sin.IV.—Life 67 3,ykh ?

Sometimes, with interested motives it must be owned, we induce him to accompany us to the Hammam, 2 where he insists upon paying the smallest sum, quarrelling with everything and 1 This is the ' imposition ' of Oxford and Cambridge. 2 The Hammam, or hot bath, being a kind of religious estab lishment, is one of the class of things—so uncomfortably numerous in Eastern countries—left 'aid jud'ak, 41 to thy generosity.' Conse quently, you are pretty sure to have something disagreeable there, which you would vainly attempt to avoid by liberality. The best way to deal with all such extortioners, with the Lawingi (undresser) of a Cairo Hammam, or the ' jarvey ' of a London Hansom, is to find out the fare, and never to go beyond it—never to be generous. The Hammam has been too often noticed to bear another descrip tion : one point, however, connected with it I must be allowed to notice. Mr. Lane (Modern Egyptians) asserts that a Moslem should not pray nor recite the Koran in it, as the bath is believed to be a favourite resort of Jinnis (or genii). On the contrary, it is the custom of some sects to recite a Ruk'atayn (two-bow) prayer immediately after religious ablution in the hot cistern. This, how ever, is makruh, or improper without being sinful, to the followers of Abu Hanifah. As a general rule, throughout Al-Islam, the Fan (obligatory) prayers may be recited everywhere, no matter how im pure the place may be: but those belonging to the classes sunnat (traditionary) and nafilah (supererogatory) are makruh, though not M actually unlawful, in certain localities. I venture this remark on account of the extreme accuracy of the work referred to. A wonder- im ful contrast to the generality of Oriental books, it amply deserves a revision in the rare places requiring care.

This year the Ramazan befell in June, and a fearful infliction was that ' blessed month,' making the Moslem unhealthy and unamiable. For the space of sixteen consecutive hours and a quarter, we were forbidden to eat, drink, smoke, snuff, and even to swallow our saliva designedly. I say forbidden, for although the highest orders of Turks,—the class is popularly described as 41 Turco fino Mangia porco e beve vino,'— may break the ordinance in strict privacy, popular opinion would condemn any open infraction of it with uncommon severity. In this, as in most human things, how many are there who hold that ' Pecher en secret n'est pas pecher, Ce n'est que I'eclat qui fait le crime' ? The middle and lower ranks observe the duties of the season, however arduous, with exceeding zeal: of all who suffered severely from such total abstinence, I found but one patient who would eat even to save his life. And among the vulgar, sinners who habitually drink when they should pray, will fast and perform their devotions through the Ramazan. Like the Italian, the Anglo-Catholic, and the Greek fasts, the chief effect of the ' blessed month ' upon True Believers is to darken their tempers into positive gloom.I V.— The 75 Their voices, never of the softest, acquire, especially after noon, a terribly harsh and creaking tone. The men curse one another 1 and beat the women. The women slap and abuse the children, and these in their turn cruelly entreat, and use bad language to, the dogs and cats. You can scarcely spend ten minutes in any populous part of the city without hearing some violent dispute. The ' Karakun,' or station-houses, are filled with lords who have administered an undue dose of chastisement to their ladies, and with ladies who have scratched, bitten, and otherwise injured the bodies of their lords. The Mosques are crowded with a sulky, grumbling population, making themselves offensive to one another on earth whilst working their way to heaven; and in the shade, under the outer walls, the little boys who have been expelled the church attempt to forget their miseries in spiritless play. In the bazars and streets, pale long-drawn faces, looking for the most part intolerably cross, catch your eye, and at this season a stranger will sometimes meet with positive incivility. A shopkeeper, for instance, usually says when he rejects an insufficient offer, ' Yaftah Allah,'—'Allah opens. 2 ' During the Ramazan, he will grumble about the bore of Ghashim, or ' Johnny raws,' and gruffly tell you not to stand there wasting his time. But as a rule the shops are either shut or destitute of shopmen, merchants will not purchase, and students will not study. In fine, 1 Of course all quarrelling, abuse, and evil words are strictly forbidden to the Moslem during Ramazan. If one believer insult another, the latter should repeat 11 1 am fasting 1 ' three times before venturing himself to reply. Such is the wise law. But human nature in Egypt, as elsewhere, is always ready to sacrifice the spirit to the letter, rigidly to obey the physical part of an ordinance, and to cast away the moral, as if it were the husk and not the kernel. 2 Allah opens (the door of daily bread) is a polite way of inform ing a man that you and he are not likely to do business; in other words, that you are not in want of his money.76 Pilgrimage toAl-Madimh Meccah. the Ramazan, for many classes, is one-twelfth of the year prayers, s wantonly thrown away. ^ ^ fa The following is the routine of a fast day. About tlie rich! half an hour after midnight, the gun sounds its warning from daw: to faithful men that it is time to prepare for the ' Sahur,' The: (early breakfast) or morning meal.

The first thing on rising is to perform the Wuzu, or lesser ablution, which invariably follows sleep in a re clining position; without this it would be improper to pray, to enter the Mosques, to approach a religious man, or to touch the Koran. A few pauper patients usually visit me at this hour, report the phenomena of their com plaints,—which they do, by the bye, with unpleasant minuteness of detail,—and receive fresh instructions. At 9 a.m. Shaykh Mohammed enters, with ' lecture ' written upon his wrinkled brow ; or I pick him up on the way, and proceed straight to the Mosque Al-Azhar. After three hours' hard reading, with little interruption from bystanders—this is long vacation, most of the students being at home—comes the call to mid-day prayer. The founder of Al-Islam ordained but few devotions for the morning, which is the business part of the Eastem day; but during the afternoon and evening they succeed one another rapidly, and their length increases. It is then time to visit my rich patients, and afterwards, by way ot accustoming myself to the sun, to wander among the bookshops for an hour or two, or simply to idle m the street. At 3 p.m. I return home, recite the afternoon prayers, and re-apply myself to study. This is the worst part of the day. In Egypt the summer nights and mornings are, generally speaking , foVthe ensuing day; the Malikis, on the other hand, ' pUr P°f abstinence but once for the thirty days of Ramazan. Lane tells a pleasant tale of a thief in the Mosque saying, 'I purpose (before prayer) to carry off this nice pair of new shoes!' 1 Many go to sleep immediately after the Imsak; or about a quarter of an hour before the dawn prayer, and do not perform their morning devotions till they awake.

Here a bare-footed girl trills and quavers, accompanied by a noisy tambourine and a ' scrannel pipe ' of abominable discordance, in honour of a perverse saint whose corpse insisted upon being buried inside some respectable man's dwelling-house. 4 The scene reminds you strongly of the Someurs of Brittany and the Zampognavi from the Abruz- zian Highlands bagpiping before the Madonna.

They take about an hour, consisting of 23 prostrations, with the Salara (or blessing on the Prophet) after every second prostration. 3 The Shisha, or Egyptian and Syrian water-pipe, is too well known to require any description. It is filled with a kind of tobacco called Tumbak, for which see Chap. 4 of this Volume. 4 Strangers often wonder to see a kind of cemetery let into a dwelling-house in a crowded street. The reason is, that some obsti nate saint has insisted upon being buried there, by the simple process of weighing so heavily in his bier, that the bearers have been obliged to place him on the pavement. Of course, no good Moslem would object to have his ground floor occupied by the corpse of a holy man. The reader will not forget, that in Europe statues have the whims which dead bodies exhibit in Egypt.

' O Allah bless him !' respond the good Moslems, some shrinking up to the walls to avoid the stick, others rush ing across the road, so as to give themselves every chance of being knocked down.

He is a short, thin man about thirty-five, with regular features and the usual preposterous lamb-skin cap and beard, two peaked black cones at least four feet in length, measured from the tips, resting on a slender basement of pale yellow face. After a quarter of an hour of ceremonies, polite mutterings and low bendings with the right hand on the left breast, the Mirza's pipe was handed to him first, in token of his dignity—at Teheran he was probably an under-clerk in some government office. In due time we were all served with Kaliiins 1 (Persian hookahs) and coffee by the ser vants, who made royal conges whenever they passed the great man ; and more than once the janissary, in dignity of belt and crooked sabre, entered the court to quicken our awe. The conversation was the usual Oriental thing. It is, for instance, understood that you have seen strange things in strange lands. ' Voyaging—is—victory,' quotes the Mirza ; the quotation is a hackneyed one, but it steps forth majestic as to pause and emphasis. ' Verily,' you reply with equal ponderousness of pronunciation and novelty of citation, in leaving home one learns life, yet a journey is a bit of Jahannam.' Or if you are a physician the will be, ' Little-learn'd doctors the body destroy: Little-learn'd parsons the soul destroy.' To which you will make answer, if you would pass for a man of lelles lettves, by the well-known lines, ' Of a truth, the physician hath power with drugs. Which, long as the patient hath life, may relieve him; But the tale of our days being duly told. The doctor is daft, and his drugs deceive him.'

When the Byzantine Christians, after overthrowing the temples of Paganism, meditated re-building and re modelling them, poverty of invention and artistic impotence reduced them to group the spoils in a heterogeneous mass. 1 The sea-ports of Egypt and the plains and moun tains of Syria abounding in pillars of granite, syenite and precious marbles, in Pharaonic, Grecian, and Roman statuary, and in all manner of structural ornaments, the architects were at no loss for material. Their Syncretism, the result of chance and precipitancy, of extravagance and incuriousness, fell under eyes too ignorant to be hurt by the hybrid irregularity : it was perpetuated in the so-called Saracenic style, a plagiarism from the Byzantine, 3 and it was reiterated in the Gothic, an offshoot from the Saracenic. 3 This fact accounts in the Gothic style for its manifold incongruities of architecture, and for the phenomenon,—not solely attributable to the buildings 1 In the capitals of the columns, for instance. 2 This direct derivation is readily detected in the Mosques at Old Cairo. 3 The roof supported by arches resting on pillars, was unknown to classic antiquity, and in the earliest ages of Al-Islam, the cloisters were neither arched nor domed. A modern writer justly observes, 'A compound of arcade and colonnade was suggested to the archi tects of the Middle Ages by the command that ancient buildings gave them of marble columns. nVI.—The 9i having been erected piecemeal,—of its most classic period being that of its greatest irregularity. Such ' architectural lawlessness,' such disregard for symmetry,—the result, I believe, of an imperfect ' amal gamation and enrichment,'—may doubtless be defended upon the grounds both of cause and of effect.

In some places we find rings of halves i: stones, like the Persian Pyroetheia; in others, circular intercohi concave buildings representing the vault of heaven, where cr ctisin, Fire, the divine symbol, was worshipped ; and in Arabia, ideas of columnar aisles, which, surmounted by the splendid blue mirin g t vault, resemble the palm-grove. The Greeks adopted ~T^n this idea in the fanes of Creator Bacchus; and at Pozzuoli, 'iasachi near Naples, it may be seen in the building vulgarly That the. Called the Temple of Serapis. It was equally well known - reat ' s siVI.—The 93 ^i-Walid to the Kelts: in some places the Temenos was a circle, e t madt in others a quadrangle.

The icarville cloisters in the Mosque became cells, used as lecture tself, in rooms, and stores for books bequeathed to the college. &gt;1 would They are unequal, because some are required to be of tninaret larger, others to be of smaller, dimensions. The same balcony reason causes difference of size when the building is tnodem distributed into four hyposteles opening upon the area: prism, the porch in the direction of the Ka'abah, where wor- handelk shippers mostly congregate, demands greater depth linaret than the other three.

Nothing affords the Meccans greater94 Pilgrimage toAl-Madimh little for the execution of mere details, and they have not the acumen to discern the effect which clumsy workman- ship, crooked lines, and visible joints,—parts apparently insignificant,—exercise upon the whole of an edifice. Their use of colours was a false taste, commonly displayed by mankind in their religious houses, and statues of the gods. The Hindus paint their pagodas, inside and outside; and rub vermilion, in token of honour, over their deities. The Persian Colossi of Kaiomars and his consort on the Balkh road and the Sphinx of Egypt, as well as the temples of the Nile, still show traces of artificial complexion. The fanes in classic Greece have been dyed. In the Forum Romanum, one of the finest buildings, still bears stains of the Tyrian purple. And to mention no other instances, in the churches and belfries of Modern Italy, we see alternate bands of white and black material so disposed as to give them the appearance of giant zebras. The origin of ' Arab esque ' ornament must be referred to one of the principles of Al-Islam. The Moslem, forbidden by his law to decorate his Mosque with statuary and pictures, 1 supplied their place with quotations from the Koran, and inscriptions, ' plastic metaphysics,' of marvellous per- pride than the vast size of their temple. N othing is more humiliating to the people of Al-Madinah than the comparative smallness of their Mosque. Still, with a few exceptions, Arab greatness is the vulgar great, not the grand. i That is to say, imitations of the human form. All the doctors of Al-Islam, however, differ on this head: some absolutely forbidding any delineation of what has life, under pain of being cast into hell; others permitting pictures even of the bodies, though not of the faces, of men. The Arabs are the strictest of Misiconists; yet even they allow plans and pictures of the Holy Shrines. Other nations are comparatively lax. The Alhambra abounds in paintings and fres coes. The Persians never object to depict in books and on walls the battles of Rustam, and the Turks preserve in the Seraglio treasury of Constantinople portraits, by Greeks and other artists, of their Sultans in regular succession.VI. — 95 have not plexity.

Perhaps no Eastern city affords more numerous or more accessible specimens of Mosque architecture than Cairo. Between 300 and 400 places of worship ^ some stately piles, others ruinous hovels, many new, more decaying and earthquake-shaken, with minarets that rival in obliquity the Pisan monster, are open to the traveller's inspection. And Europeans by following the advice of their hotel-keeper have penetrated, and can penetrate, into any one they please. 2 If architecture be really what I believe it to be, the highest expression of a people's artistic feeling,—highest because it includes all others,— to compare the several styles of the different epochs, to observe how each monarch building his own Mosque, and calling it by his own name, identified the manner of the monument with himself, and to trace the gradual decadence of art through one thousand two hundred years, down to the present day, must be a work of no ordinary inter est to Orientalists. The limits of my plan, however, compel me to place only the heads of the argument before the reader. May I be allowed to express a hope that it will induce some learned traveller to investigate a subject in every way worthy his attention ?

Around the court runs a tolerably well-built colonnade, whose entablature is garnished with crimson arabesques, and in the inner wall are pierced apartments, now closed with plank doors. Of the Riwak, as the porches are called, the Azhar contains twenty-four, one for each re cognised nation in Al-Islam, and of these fifteen are still open to students. 1 Inside them we find nothing but matting and a pile of large dingy wooden boxes, which once contained the college library; they are now, generally speaking, empty. 2 There is nothing worth seeing in the cluster of little dark chambers that form the remainder of the Azhar. Even the Zawiyat al-Umyan (or the Blind men's Oratory), a place where so many 'town and gown rows' have emanated, is rendered interesting only by the fanaticism of its inmates, and the certainty that, if recognised in this 1 Amongst them is a foundation for Jawi scholars. Some of our authors, by a curious mistake, have confounded Moslem Jawa (by the Egyptians pronounced Gawa), with ' Goa,' the Christian colony of the Portuguese. 2 Cairo was once celebrated for its magnificent collections of books. Besides private libraries, each large Mosque had its biblio- theca, every MS. of which was marked with the word 'Wakf' (entailed bequest), or ' Wukifa I'lllahi Ta'ala ' (bequeathed to God Almighty). But Cairo has now for years supplied other countries with books, and the decay of religious zeal has encouraged the unprincipled to steal and sell MSS. marked with the warning words. The Hijaz, in particular, has been inundated with books from Egypt, Cairo has still some large libraries, but most of them are private property, and the proprietors will not readily lend or give access to their treasures. The principal opportunity of buying books is dur ing the month Ramazan, when they are publicly sold in the Azhar Mosque. The Orientalist will, however, meet with many disappoint ments ; besides the difficulty of discovering good works, he will find in the booksellers, scribes, et hoc genusomne, a finished race of scoun drels.Pilgyitn&amp;gt to Al-Mcidini Mccccih sanctum, we shall run the gauntlet under the staves of its proprietors, the angry blind. The Azhar is the grand collegiate Mosque of this city,—the Christ Church, in fact, of Cairo, once cele brated throughout the world of Al-Islam. It was built, I was told, originally in poor style by one Jauhar al- K&amp;id, 1 originally the slave of a Moorish merchant, in consequence of a dream that ordered him to ' erect a place whence the light of science should shine upon Al-Islam.' It gradually increased by 'Wakf 2 ' (entailed be quests) of lands, money, and books; and pious rulers made a point of adding to its size and wealth. Of late years it has considerably declined, the result of sequestra- tions, and of the diminished esteem in which the purely religious sciences are now held in the land of Egypt. 5 Yet it is calculated that between 2000 and 3000 students of all nations and ages receive instructio n here g ratis . 1 Lane (Mod. Egyptians) has rectified Baron von Hammer- Purgstall's mistake concerning the word 'Azhar'; our English Orientalist translates it the ' splendid Mosque.' I would venture to add, that the epithet must be understood in a spiritual and not in a material sense. Wilkinson attributes the erection of the building to Jauhar al-Kaid, general under Al-Moaz, about a.d. 970. Wilson ascribes it partly to Al-Moaz the Fatimite {a.d. 973), partly to his general and successor, Al-Hakim (?). 2 Wakf, property become mortmain. My friend Yacoub Artin declares that the whole Nile Valley has parcel by parcel been made Wakf at some time or other, and then retaken. 3 If I may venture to judge, after the experience of a few months, there is now a re-action in favour of the old system. Mohammed Ali managed to make his preparatory, polytechnic, and other schools, thoroughly distasteful to the people, and mothers blinded their children, to prevent their being devoted for life to infidel studies. The printing-press, contrasting in hideousness with the beauty of the written character, and the contemptible Arabic style of the various works translated by order of government from the European languages, have placed arms in the hands of the orthodox party./ VI.— The 103 ives ol E ac h one is provided with bread, in a quantity deter mined by the amount of endowment, at the Riwak set apart of this f or his nation, 1 with some article of clothing on festival e cele days, and a few piastres once a year.

The book first read is the text, called Mardh al-FaUh, es, but containing about twenty pages, and its commentary, which is about entary six times longer. Then comes the Matn al-Kanz, a brief text of from 5 Katr 35 to 40 pages, followed by three long Sharh. The shortest of these, id last M Al-Tai,'contains500pages; thenext, ''MullaMiskin,' atleastgoo; and the 11 Sharh Ayni' nearly 2000. To these succeeds the Textio6 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. the Shafe'i's reading is not quite so extensive. 1 Theo logy is much studied, because it leads directly to the gain ing of daily bread, as priest or tutor; and other scientific pursuits are neglected for the opposite reason. The theologian in Egypt, as in other parts of Al- Islam, must have a superficial knowledge of the Prophet's traditions. Of these there are eight well known collec tions, 2 but only the first three are generally read. School-boys are instructed, almost when in their infancy, to intone the Koran ; at the university they are ' Al-Durar,' the work of the celebrated Khusraw, (200 pages), with a large commentary by the same author; and last is the Matn Tanwir Al-Absar, containing about 500 pages, and its Sharh, a work upwards of four times the size. Many of these books may be found—especially when the MS. is an old one—with Hashiyah, or marginal notes, but most men write them for themselves, so that there is no generally used collection. The above-mentioned are the works containing a full course of theological study; it is rare, however, to find a man who reads beyond the ' Al-Kanz,' with the shortest of its commentaries, the ' Al-Tai.' 1 He begins with a little text called, after the name of its author, Abu Shuja'a of Isfahan, and proceeds to its commentary, a book of about 250pages, by Ibn Kasim of Ghazzah (Gaza). There is another Sharh, nearly four times larger than this, ' Al-Khatib ' ; it is seldom read. Then comes Al-Tahrir, the work of Zakariya al-Ansari,—a celebrated divine buried in the Mosque of Al-Shafe'i,—and its com mentary by the same author, a goodly MS. of 600 pages. Most students here cry: 'Enough!' The ambitious pass on to al- Minhaj and its commentary, (1600 pages). Nor need they stop at this point. A man may addle his brains over Moslem theology, as upon Aristotle's schoolmen, till his eyesight fails him—both subjects are all but interminable. 2 The three best known are the Arbain al-Nawawi, and the Sahihayn—' the two (universally acknowledged to be) trustworthy,'— by Al-Muslim and Al-Bokhari, celebrated divines. The others are Al-Jami' al-Saghir, ' the smaller collection,' so called to distinguish it from a rarer book, Al-Jami al-Kabir, the ' greater collection '; both are the work of Al-Siyuti. The full course concludes with Al-Shifa, Shamail, and the labours of Kazi Ayyaz.VL—The Mosque. taught a more exact system of chanting. The style called ' Hafs' is most common in Egypt, as it is indeed throughout the Moslem world. And after learning to read the holy volume, some savans are ambitious enough to wish to understand it: under these circumstances they must dive into the 'Ilm al-Tafsir, 1 or the Exegesis of the Koran. Our student is now a perfect Fakih or Mulla. 2 But 1 Two Tafsirs are known all over the modern world. The smaller one is called Jalalani (' the two Jalals,' i .e. the joint work of Jalal al-Siyuti and Jalal al-Mahalli), and fills two stout volumes octavo. The larger is the Exposition of Al-Bayzawi, which is sup posed to contain the whole subject. Some few divines read AI- Khazin. 2 To conclude the list of Moslem studies, not purely religious. Al-Mantik (or logic) is little valued; it is read when judged ad visable, after Al-Nahw, from which it flows, and before Ma'ani Bayan (rhetoric) to which it leads. In Egypt, students are generally directed to fortify their memories, and give themselves a logical turn of mind, by application to Al-Jabr (algebra). The only logical works known are the Isaghuji (the elcraydyr) of Porphyry), Al-Shamsiyah, the book Al-Sullam, with its Sharh Al-Akhzari, and, lastly, Kazi Mir. Equally neglected are the Tawarikh (history) and the Hikmat (or philosophy), once so ardently cultivated by Moslem savans; indeed, it is now all but impossible to get books upon these subjects. For upwards of six weeks, I ransacked the stalls and the bazar, in order to find some one of the multitudinous annals of Al-Hijaz, without seeing for sale anything but the fourth volume of a large bio graphical work called al-Akd al-Samin fi Tarikh al-Balad al-Amin. The 'Ilm al-'Aruz, or Prosody, is not among the Arabs, as with us, a chapter hung on to the tail of grammar. It is a long and difficult study, prosecuted only by those who wish to distinguish themselves in 11 Arabiyat,'—the poetry and the eloquence of the ancient and modern Arabs. The poems generally studied, with the aid of commentaries, which impress every verse upon the memory, are the Burdah and the Hamziyah, well-known odes by Mohammed of Abusir. They abound in obsolete words, and are useful at funerals, as on other solemn occasions. The Banat Su'adi, by Ka'ab al-Ahbar (or Akhbar), a companion of the Apostle, and the Diwan 'Umar ibn Fariz, a celebrated mystic, are also learned compositions. Few attempt the bulky volume of Al-Mutanabbi-—though manyio8 Pilgrimage to A l-Madinah Meccah. the poor fellow has no scholarship or fellowship—no easy tutorship—no fat living to look forward to. After wasting place it open upon the sofa,—fewer still the tenebrous compositions of Al-Hariri; nor do the modern Egyptians admire those fragments of ancient Arab poets, which seem so sweetly simple to the European ear. The change of faith has altered the national taste to such an extent, that the decent bard must now sing of woman in the mascu- line gender. For which reason, a host of modern poetasters can attract the public ear, which is deaf to the voices of the 41 Golden Song.'* In the exact sciences, the Egyptian Moslems, a backward race according to European estimation, are far superior to the Persians and the Moslems of India. Some of them become tolerable arith meticians, though very inferior to the Coptic Christians ; they have good and simple treatises on algebra, and still display some of their ancestors' facility in the acquisition of geometry. The 'Ilm al- Mikat, or ^ Calendar-calculating,' was at one time publicly taught in the Azhar; the printing-press has doomed that study to death. The natural sciences find but scant favour on the banks of the Nile. Astronomy is still astrology, geography a heap of names, and natural history a mass of fables. Alchemy, geomancy, and sum moning of fiends, are pet pursuits ; but the former has so bad a name, that even amongst friends it is always alluded to as,'Ilm al-Kdf,—the 'science of K,' so called from the initial letter of the word 'Kimiya.' Of the state of therapeutics I have already treated at length. Aided by the finest of ears, and flexible organs of articulation, the Egyptian appears to possess many of the elements of a good linguist. The stranger wonders to hear a Cairene donkey-boy shouting sentences in three or four European dialects, with a pro nunciation as pure as his own. How far this people succeed in higher branches of language, my scanty experience does not enable me to determine. But even for students of Arabic, nothing can be more imperfect than those useful implements. Vocabularies and Dic tionaries. The Cairenes have, it is true, the Kamus of Fayruzabadi, but it has never been printed in Egypt; it is therefore rare, and when found, lost pages and clerical errors combined with the intrinsic diffi culty of the style, exemplify the saying of Golius, that the most learned Orientalist must act the part of a diviner, before he can perform that of interpreter. They have another Lexicon, the Sihah, and an abbreviation of the same, the Sihah al-Saghir (or the lesser), both of them liable to the same objections as the Kamus. For the benefit of the numerous students of Turkish and Persian, short grammarsVI. — 109 -no easj seven years, or twice seven years, over his studies, and wasting reading till his brain is dizzy, his digestion gone, and his ipositions e y es blind, he must either starve upon college alms, ragments or squat, like my old Shaykh Mohammed, in a druggist's iuropean shop, or become pedagogue and preacher in some country such at place, on the pay of £8per annum.

Both are what Eastern faiths and Eastern training have ever been,—both are eminently adapted for the Oriental mind. When the people learn to appreciate ethics, and to understand psychics and sesthetics, the demand will create a supply. Meanwhile they leave transcendentalism to their poets and philosophers, and they busy themselves with preparing for heaven by practising the only part of their faith now intelligible to them—the Material. It is not to be supposed that a nation in this stage of civilisation could be so fervently devout as the Egyptians are, without the bad leaven of bigotry. The same tongue which is employed in blessing Allah, is, it is conceived, doing its work equally well in cursing Allah's enemies. Wherefore the Kafir is denounced by every sex, age, class, and condition, by the man of the world, 1 as by the boy at school; and out of, as well as in, the Mosque. If you ask your friend who is the person with a black tur- band, he replies, ' A Christian. Allah make his Countenance cold !' If you inquire of your servant, who are the people singing in the next house, it is ten to one that his answer will be, ' Jews. May their lot be Jahannam!' It appears unintelligible, still it is not less true, that Egyptians who have lived as servants under European roofs for years, retain the liveliest loathing for the manners Egyptian or Persian say exactly the same thing about the systems of Christ Church and Trinity College ? i And when the man of the world, as sometimes happens, pro fesses to see no difference in the forms of faith, or whispers that his residence in Europe has made him friendly to the Christian religion, you will be justified in concluding his opinions to be latitudinarian.VI.— The Mosque. m v itself and customs of their masters.

General Sebastiani insisted upon wearing his military boots; and the Republican Aubert Dubajet rejected the dinner, and the rich dress, with which 44 the naked and hungry barbarian who ventured to rub his brow upon the Sublime Porte,' was fed and clothed before being admitted to the presence, saying that the ambassadors of France wanted neither this nor that. At Cairo, M. Sabatier, the French Consul-general, has had the merit of doing away with some customs prejudicial to the dignity of his nation. The next English envoy will, if anxious so to distinguish himself, have an excellent opportunity. It is usual, after the first audience, for the Pasha to send, in token of honour, a sorry steed to the new comer. This custom is a mere relic of the days when Mohammed the Second threatened to stable his charger in St. Peter's, and when a ride through the streets of Cairo exposed the Inspector- general Tott, and his suite, to lapidation and an 44 avanie' To send a good horse is to imply degradation, but to offer a bad one is a posi tive insult.VI.—The Mosque. 11 3 heavy tribute, and yet able to show a considerable sur plus of revenue, this country in western hands will com mand India, and by a ship-canal between Pelusium and Suez would open the whole of Eastern Africa. 1 There is no longer much to fear from the fanaticism of the people, and a little prudence would suffice to com mand the interests of the Mosque. 2 The chiefs of corpora tions, 3 in the present state of popular feeling, would offer 1 As this canal has become a question of national interest, its advisability is surrounded with all the circumstance of unsupported assertion and bold deniaL The English want a railroad, which would confine the use of Egypt to themselves. The French desire a canal that would admit the hardy cruisers of the Mediterranean into the Red Sea. The cosmopolite will hope that both projects may be carried out. Even in the seventh century Omar forbade Amru to cut the Isthmus of Suez for fear of opening Arabia to Christian vessels. As regards the feasibility of the ship-canal, I heard M. Linant de Bellefonds—the best authority upon all such subjects in Egypt—ex pressly assert, after levelling and surveying the line, that he should have no difficulty in making it. The canal is now a fact. As late as April, 1864, Lord Palmerston informed the House of Commons that labourers might be more usefully employed in cultivating cotton than in 11 digging a canal through a sandy desert, and in making two harbours in deep mud and shallow water.' It is, however, under stood that the Premier was the only one of his Cabinet who took this view. Mr. Robert Stephenson, C.E., certainly regretted before his death the opinion which he had been induced to express by desire. 2 There are at present about eighteen influential Shaykhs at Cairo, too fanatic to listen to reason. These it would be necessary to banish. Good information about what goes on in each Mosque, espec ially on Fridays, when the priests preach to the people, and a guard of honour placed at the gates of the Kazi, the three Muftis, and the Shaykh of the Azhar, are simple precautions sufficient to keep the Olema in order. 3 These Rakaiz Al-'Usab, as they are called, are the most influen tial part of the immense mass cf dark intrigue which Cairo, like most Oriental cities, conceals beneath the light surface.

After which we ate and drank heartily; then, with pipes and tobacco-pouches in hand, we sauntered out to enjoy the contemplation of smiling faces and street scenery.

This year's Id was made gloomy, comparatively speak ing, by the state of politics. Report of war with Russia, with France, with England, who was going to land three million men at Suez, and with Infideldom in general, rang through Egypt, and the city of Mars 3 became un usually martial. The government armouries, arsenals, and manufactories, were crowded with kidnapped work men. Those who purposed a pilgrimage feared forcible detention.

It was so called because, as Richardson has informed the world, it was founded in a.d. 968 by one Jauhar, a Dalmatian renegade before mentioned, when the warlike planet was in the ascendant.Ii8 Pilgrimage to Al-Madin closed the doors, and made forcible capture of the able- bodied. This proceeding, almost as barbarous as our impressment law, filled the main streets with detach ments of squalid-looking wretches, marching to be made soldiers, with collars round their necks and irons on their wrists. The dismal impression of the scene was deepened by crowds of women, who, habited in mourning, and scat tering dust and mud over their rent garments, followed their sons, brothers, and husbands, with cries and shrieks. The death-wail is a peculiar way of cheering on the patriot departing pro patrid and the origin of the custom is characteristic of the people. The principal public amusements allowed to Oriental women are those that come under the general name of ' Fantasia,'— birth-feasts, marriage festivals, and funerals. And the early campaigns of Mohammed Ali's family in Syria, and Al-Hijaz having, in many cases, deprived the be reaved of their sex-right to ' keen ' for the dead, they have now determined not to waste the opportunity, but to revel in the luxury of woe at the live man's wake. 1 Another cloud hung over Cairo. Rumours of con spiracy were afloat. The Jews and Christians,—here as ready to take alarm as the English in Italy,—trembled at the fancied preparations for insurrection, massacre, and plunder. And even the Moslems whispered that some hundred desperadoes had resolved to fire the city, be ginning with the bankers' quarter, and to spoil the wealthy Egyptians. Of course H.H. Abbas Pasha was absent at the time, and, even had he been at Cairo, his presence would have been of little use: the ruler can do nothing i ' There were no weeping women ; no neighbours came in to sit down in the ashes, as they might have done had the soldier died at home; there was no Nubian dance for the dead, no Egyptian song of the women lauding the memory of the deceased, and beseeching him to tell why he had left them alone in the world to weep.'—(Letter from Widdin, March 25, 1854, describing a Turkish soldier's funeral.)VII. — Preparations Quit 119 0 ^^a| towards restoring confidence to a panic-stricken Oriental r0 ^ s as 6,1 nation.

If the West would raise the character of its Eastern co-religionists, it will be forced to push the system a point further, and to allow all bond-fide Christian subjects to register their names at the different Consulates whose protection they might prefer. This is what Russia has so ' unwarrantably and outrageously' attempted. We confine ourselves to a lesser injustice, which deprives Eastern states of their right as independent Powers to arrest, and to judge foreigners, who for interest or convenience settle in their dominions. But we still shudder at the right of arrogating any such claim over the born lieges of Oriental Powers. What, however, would be the result were Great Britain to authorise her sons resident at Paris, or Florence, to refuse attendance at a French or an Italian court of justice, and to demand that the police should never force the doors of an English subject ? I commend this consideration to all those who ' stickle for abstract rights ' when the interest and progress of others are concerned, and who become somewhat latitudinarian and concrete in cases where their own welfare and aggrandisement are at stake. Besides patients, I made some pleasant acquaint ances at Cairo. Antun Zananire, a young Syrian of considerable attainments as a linguist, paid me the com pliment of permitting me to see the fair face of his ' Harim.' Mr. Hatchadur Nury, an Armenian gentle man, well known in Bombay, amongst other acts of kind ness, introduced me to one of his compatriots, Khwajah Yusuf, whose advice was most useful to me. The Khwajah had wandered far and wide, picking up everywhere some scrap of strange knowledge, and his history was a romance. Expelled from Cairo for a youthful peccadillo, he started upon his travels, qualified himself for sanctity at Meccah and Al-Madinah, became a religious beggar at Baghdad, studied French at Paris, and finally settledVII.— Preparations 123 down as a professor of languages, 1 under an amnesty, at Cairo. In his house I saw an Armenian marriage. The occasion was memorable: after the gloom and same ness of Moslem society, nothing could be more glad dening than the unveiled face of a pretty woman. Some of the guests were undeniably charming brunettes, with the blackest possible locks, and the brightest conceivable eyes. Only one pretty girl wore the national costume; 3 yet they all smoked chibuks and sat upon the Diwans, and, as they entered the room, they kissed with a sweet simplicity the hands of the priest, and of the other old gentlemen present. Among the number of my acquaintances was a Meccan boy, Mohammed al-Basyuni, from whom I bought the pilgrim-garb called ' Al-Ihram' and the Kafan or shroud, with which the Moslem usually starts upon such a journey as mine. He, being in his way homewards after a visit to Constantinople, was most anxious to accompany me in the character of a ' companion. But he had travelled too much to suit me; he had visited India, he had seen Englishmen, and he had lived with the ' Nawab Balu ' of Surat. Moreover, he showed signs of over-wisdom. He had been a regular visitor, till I cured one of his friends of an ophthalmia, after which 1 Most Eastern nations, owing to their fine ear for sounds, are quick at picking up languages ; but the Armenian is here, what the Russian is in the West, the facile prin of conversational linguists. I have frequently heard them speak with the purest accent, and admirable phraseology, besides their mother tongue, Turkish, Arabic, Persian, and Hindustani, nor do they evince less aptitude for acquiring the Occidental languages. 2 It has been too frequently treated of, to leave room for a fresh description Though pretty and picturesque, it is open to the re proach of Moslem dressing, namely, that the in-door toilette admits of a display of bust, and is generally so scanty and flimsy that it is unfit vO meet the eye of a stranger This, probably the effect of secluding women, has now become a cause for concealing them.124 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. he gave me his address at Meccah, and was seen no more. Haji Wali described him and his party to be ' Nas jarrar' (extractors), and certainly he had not misjudged them. But the sequel will prove how Mensch denkt und Gottlenkt; and as the boy, Mo hammed, eventually did become my companion throughout the Pilgrimage, I will place him before the reader as summarily as possible. He is a beardless youth, of about eighteen, choco late-brown, with high features, and a bold profile; his bony and decided Meccan cast of face is lit up by the peculiar Egyptian eye, which seems to descend from generation to generation. 1 His figure is short and broad, with a tendency to be obese, the result of a strong stomach and the power of sleeping at discretion. He can read a little, write his name, and is uncommonly clever at a bargain. Meccah had taught him to speak excellent Arabic, to understand the literary dialect, to be eloquent in abuse, and to be profound at Prayer and Pilgrimage. Constantinople had given him a taste for Anacreontic singing, and female society of the question able kind, a love of strong waters,—the hypocrite looked positively scandalised when I first suggested the subject, —and an off-hand latitudinarian mode of dealing with serious subjects in general. I found him to be the youngest son of a widow, whose doting fondness had moulded his disposition; he was selfish and affectionate, as spoiled children usually are, volatile, easily offended and as easily pacified (the Oriental), coveting other men's goods, and profuse of his own (the Arab), with a match less intrepidity of countenance (the traveller), brazen lunged, not more than half brave, exceedingly astute, with an acute sense of honour, especially where his i He was from the banks of the Nile, as his cognomen, al- Basyuni proves, but his family, I was told, had been settled for three or four generations at Meccah.VII.— Preparations 125 relations were concerned (the individual). I have seen him in a fit of fury because some one cursed his father; and he and I nearly parted because on one oc casion I applied to him an epithet which, etymologically considered, might be exceedingly insulting to a high- minded brother, but which in popular signifies nothing. This il point d'hottneur ' was the boy Mohammed s strong point. During the Ramazan I laid in my stores for the journey. These consisted of tea, coffee, loaf-sugar, rice, dates, biscuit, oil, vinegar, tobacco, lanterns, and cooking pots, a small bell-shaped tent, costing twelve shillings, and three water-skins for the Desert. 1 The provisions were placed in a ' Kafas ' or hamper artistically made of palm sticks, and in a huge Sahharah, or wooden box, about three feet each way, covered with leather or skin, and provided with a small lid fitting into the top. 2 The 1 Almost all the articles of food were so far useful, that they served every one of the party at least as much as they did their owner. My friends drank my coffee, smoked my tobacco, and ate my rice. I bought better tea at Meccah than at Cairo, and found as good sugar there. It would have been wiser to lay in a small stock merely for the voyage to Yambu', in which case there might have been more economy. But I followed the advice of those interested in setting me wrong. Turks and Egyptians always go pilgrimaging with a large outfit, as notably as the East-Indian cadet of the present day. and your outfitter at Cairo, as well as Cornhill, is sure to supply you with a variety of superfluities. The tent was useful to me ; so were the water-skins, which I preferred to barrels, as being more portable, and less liable to leak. Good skins cost about a dollar each; they should be bought new, and always kept half full of water. 2 This shape secures the lid, which otherwise, on account of the weight of the box, would infallibly be torn off, or burst open. Like the Kafas, the Sahharah should be well padlocked, and if the owner be a saving man, he does not entrust his keys to a servant. I gave away my Kafas at Yambu', because it had been crushed during the sea-voyage, and I was obliged to leave the Sahharah at Al-Madinah, as my Badawi camel-shaykh positively refused to carry it to Meccah, so that both these articles were well nigh useless to me. The Kafas126 Pilgrimage to Al-Madim former, together with my green box containing medicines, and saddle-bags full of clothes, hung on one side of the camel, a counterpoise to the big Sahharah on the other flank; the Badawin, like muleteers, always requiring a balance of weight. On the top of the load was placed trans versely a Shibriyah or cot, on which Shaykh Nur squatted like a large crow. This worthy had strutted out into the streets armed with a pair of horse-pistols and a sword almost as long as himself. No sooner did the mischievous boys of Cairo—they are as bad as the of Paris and London—catch sight of him than they began to scream with laughter at the sight of the ' Hindi (Indian) in arms,' till, like a vagrant owl pursued by a flight of larks, he ran back into the Caravanserai. Having spent all my ready money at Cairo, I was obliged to renew the supply. My native acquaintances advised me to take at least eighty pounds sterling, and considering the expense of outfit for Desert travelling, the sum did not appear excessive. I should have found some difficulty in raising the money had it not been for the kindness of a friend at Alexandria, John Thurburn, now, I c regret to say, no more, and Mr. Sam Shepheard, then of Shepheard's Hotel, Cairo, presently a landed proprietor near Rugby, and now also gone. My Indians scrutinised the diminutive square of paper 1 — the cost four shillings, and the Sahharah about twelve. When these large boxes are really strong and good, they are worth about a pound ster ling each. i At my final interview with the committee of the Royal Geo graphical Society, one member. Sir Woodbine Parish, advised an order to be made out on the Society's bankers; another, Sir Roderick Murchison, kindly offered to give me one on his own, Coutts &amp; Co.; but I, having more experience in Oriental travelling, begged only to be furnished with a diminutive piece of paper, permitting me to draw upon the Society. It was at once given by Dr. Shaw, the Secretary, and it proved of much use eventually. It was purposely made as small as possible, in order to fit into a talisman case. But the traveller mustVIL— Preparations 127 letter of credit—as a raven may sometimes be seen 31( k of 1 peering, with head askance, into the interior of a suspected ^6 othe: marrow-bone. ' Can this be a bond-fide draft ?' they e( iuiriiiff j mentally inquired. And finally they offered, politely, to lce d trans, write to England for me, to draw the money, and to for- ^squatter ward it in a sealed bag directed ' Al-Madinah.' I need it into tin scarcely say that such a style of transmission would, in 1 a swoij the case of precious metals, have left no possible chance ischievoii; of its safe arrival.

My friend Haji Wali was the first consulted ; after a long discussion he offered to take me to his Consul, the Persian, and to find out for what sum I could become a temporary subject of the Shah, We went to the sign of the ' Lion and the Sun,' and we found the dragoman, 2 a subtle Syrian Christian, who, 1 The reason of this will be explained in a future chapter. 2 The Consular dragoman is one of the greatest abuses I know. The tribe is, for the most part, Levantine and Christian, and its con nections are extensive. The father will perhaps be interpreter to the English, the son to the French Consulate. By this means the most privy affairs will become known to every member of the depart ment, except the head, and eventually to that best of spy-trainers, the Turkish government. This explains how a subordinate, whose pay is £200 per annum, and who spends double that sum, can afford, after twelve or thirteen years' service, to purchase a house for £2,000 and to furnish it for as much more. Besides which, the condition, the ideas, and the very nature of these dragomans are completely Oriental. The most timid and cringing of men, they dare not take the proper tone with a government to which, in case of the expulsion of a Consul, they and their families would become subject And their prepossessions are utterly Oriental. Hanna Massara, dragoman to the Consul-General at Cairo, in my presence and before others, advocated the secret murder of a Moslem girl who had fled with a Greek, on the grounds that an adulteress must always be put to death, either publicly or under the rose. Yet this man is an 'old and tried servant n of the State. Such evils might be in part miti gated by employing English youths, of whom an ample supply, if there were any demand, would soon be forthcoming. This measure has been advocated by the best authorities, but without success.

The captain of Irregulars being unhappily debarred the pleasure of shooting me, after looking fierce for a time, rose, and walked majestically out of the room. A day or two afterwards, he called upon me civilly enough, sat down, drank a cup of coffee, smoked a pipe, and began to converse. But as he knew about a hundred Arabic words, and I as many Turkish, our conversation was carried on under difficulties. Presently he asked me in a whisper for ' 'Araki.' 1 I replied that there was none in the house, which induced a sneer and an ejaculation sounding like ' Himar,' (ass,) the slang synonym amongst fast Moslems for water-drinker. After rising to depart, he seized me waggishly, with an eye to a trial of strength. Thinking that an Indian doctor and a temperance man would not be very dangerous, he exposed himself to what is professionally termed a ' cross-buttock,' and had his ' nut' come in contact with the stone floor instead of my bed, he might not have drunk for many a day. The fall had a good effect upon his temper. He jumped up, i Vulgarly Rakl, the cognac of Egypt and Turkey. Generically the word means any spirit; specifically, it is applied to that extracted from dates, or dried grapes. The latter is more expensive than the former, and costs from 5 to 7 piastres the bottle. It whitens the water like Eau de Cologne, and being considered a stomachic, is patronised by Europeans as much as by Asiatics. In the Azbakiyah gardens at Cairo, the traveller is astonished by perpetual 'shouts' for ' Sciroppo di gomma,' as if all the Western population was afflicted with sore throat. The reason is that spirituous liquors in a Moslem land must not be sold in places of public resort; so the infidel asks for a ' syrup of gum,' and obtains a ' dram ' of 'Araki. The favourite way of drinking it, is to swallow it neat, and to wash it down with a mouthful of cold water. Taken in this way it acts like the ' petit verre d'absinthe.' Egyptian women delight in it, and Eastern topers of all classes and sexes prefer it to brandy and cognac, the smell of which, being strange, is offensive to them.VII.— Preparations 135 ^0 ha';: patted my head, called for another pipe, and sat down to r ablebJ show me his wounds, and to boast of his exploits.

At last the Haji started upon his feet, and rushed away, regardless of any thing but escape,138 Pilgrimage to Al-Madin leaving his Tarbush, his slippers, and his pipe, in the hands of the enemy. The host did not dare to pursue his recreant guest beyond the door, but returning he carefully sprinkled the polluting liquid on the cap, pipe, and shoes, and called the Haji an ass in every tongue he knew. Then we applied ourselves to supper, and dis patched the soup, the stew, and the Salatah. A few tumblers and pipes were exhausted to obviate indigestion, when Ali Agha arose majestically, and said that he required a troop ol dancing girls to gladden his eyes with a ballet. I represented that such persons are no longer ad mitted into Caravanserais. 1 He inquired, with calm ferocity, ' who hath forbidden it ?' I replied ' the Pasha upon which Ali Agha quietly removed his cap, brushed it with his dexter fore-arm, fitted it on his fore head, raking forwards, twisted his mustachios to the sharp point of a single hair, shouldered his pipe, and moved towards the door, vowing that he would make the Pasha himself come, and dance before us. I foresaw a brawl, and felt thankful that my boon companion had forgotten his dagger. Prudence whis pered me to return to my room, to bolt the door, and to go to bed, but conscience suggested that it would be un fair to abandon the Albanian in his present helpless state. I followed him into the outer gallery, pulling him, and begging him, as a despairing wife might urge a drunken husband, to return home. And he, like the British hus band, being greatly irritated by the unjovial advice, instantly belaboured with his pipe-stick 2 the first person 1 Formerly these places, like the coffee-houses, were crowded with bad characters.

He then burst open a door with his shoulder, and reeled into a room where two aged dames were placidly reposing by the side of their spouses, who were basket- makers. They immediately awoke, seeing a stranger, and, hearing his foul words, they retorted with a hot volley of vituperation. Put to flight by the old women's tongues, Ali Agha, in spite of all my endeavours, reeled down the stairs, and fell upon the sleeping form of the night porter, whose blood he vowed to drink—the Oriental form of threaten ing ' spiflication.' Happily for the assaulted, the Agha's ^ jjf- servant, a sturdy Albanian lad, was lying on a mat in the doorway close by. Roused by the tumult, he jumped up, and found the captain in a state of fury. Apparently the man was used to the master's mood. Without delay he told us all to assist, and we lending a helping hand, half dragged and half carried the Albanian to his room. Yet even in this ignoble plight, he shouted with all the force of his lungs the old war-cry, ' O Egyptians! O race door,anil 0 f dogs!

He was right. Throughout the Caravanserai nothing was talked of for nearly a week but the wickedness of the captain of Albanian Irregulars, and the hypocrisy of the staid Indian doctor. Thus it was, gentle reader, that I lost my reputation of being a 'serious person' at Cairo. And all I have to show for it is the personal experience of an Albanian drinking-bout. I wasted but little time in taking leave of my friends, telling them, by way of precaution, that my destination g ] was Meccah via Jeddah, and firmly determining, if pos- . . sible, to make Al-Madinah via Yambu*.

But, besides ostentation, I wanted my attendant to be mounted, that we might make a forced march in order to ascertain how much a four years' life of European effeminacy had impaired my powers of endurance. The reader may believe the assertion that there are few better tests than an eighty-four mile ride in mid-summer, on a bad wooden saddle, borne by a worse dromedary, across the Suez Desert. Even the Squire famed for being copper-sheeted might not have disdained a trial of the kind. I started my Indian boy and heavy luggage for Suez two days before the end of the Id,—laden camels gene rally taking fifty-five or sixty hours to do the journey, and I spent the intermediate time with Haji Wali. He advised me to mount about 3 p.m., so that I might arrive at Suez on the evening of the next day, and assisted me i The proper hire of a return dromedary from Cairo to Suez is forty piastres.

Early on the morning of departure the Afghan Shaykh came to the Caravanserai, and breakfasted with us, ' because Allah willed it.' After a copious meal he bestowed upon me a stately benediction, and would have embraced me, but I humbly bent over his hand: sad to relate, immediately that his back was turned, Haji Wali raised his forefinger to a right angle with the palm (chaff), and burst into a shout of irreverent laughter. At three o'clock Nassar, the Badawi, came to announce that the dromedaries were saddled. I dressed myself, sticking a pistol in my belt, and passing the crim son silk cord of the ' Hamail' or pocket Koran over my shoulder, in token of being a pilgrim. Then distributing a few trifling presents to friends and servants, and accom panied by the Shaykh Mohammed and Haji Wali, I de scended the stairs with an important gait. In the courtyard squatted the camels, (dromedaries they could not be called,) and I found that a second driver was going to accompany us. I objected to this, as the extra Badawi would, of course, expect to be fed by me; but Nassar swore that the man was his brother, and as you rarely gain by small disputes with these people, he was allowed to have his own way. Then came the preparatory leave-takings. Haji Wali embraced me heartily, and so did my poor old Shaykh, who, despite his decrepitude and my objections, insisted upon accompanying me to the city gate. I mounted the camel, crossed my legs before the pommel—stirrups are not used in Egypt 1 —and, preceding my friend, de- 1 The tender traveller had better provide himself with a pair ol stirrups, but he will often find, when on camel back, that his legs are more numbed by hanging down, than by the Arab way ol crossing them before and beneath the pommel.

Presently we drew rein, and exchanged our pace for one more seasonable, whilst the sun began to tell on man and beast. High raised as we were above the ground, the reflected heat struck us sensibly, and the glare of a macadamized road added a few extra degrees of caloric. 1 The Badawin, to refresh themselves, prepare to smoke. They fill my chibuk, light it with a flint and steel, and cotton dipped in a solution of gunpowder, and pass it over to me. 2 After a few puffs I return it to them, and they use it turn by turn. Then they begin to while away the tedium of the road by asking questions, which passe-temps is not easily exhausted; for they are never satisfied till they know as much of you as you do of your self. They next resort to talking about victuals; for with this hungry race, food, as a topic of conversation, takes the place of money in happier lands. And lastly, even this engrossing subject being exhausted for the moment, 1 It is Prince Piickler Muskau, if I recollect rightly, who men tions that in his case a pair of dark spectacles produced a marked difference of apparent temperature, whilst travelling over the sultry sand of the Desert. I have often remarked the same phenomenon. The Arabs, doubtless for some reason of the kind, always draw their head-kerchiefs, like hoods, far over their brows, and cover up their mouths, even when the sun and wind are behind them. Inhabitants of the Desert are to be recognised by the net-work of wrinkles traced in the skin round the orbits, the result of half-closing their eyelids; but this is done to temper the intensity of the light. 2 Their own pipe-tubes were of coarse wood, in shape somewhat resembling the German porcelain pipe. The bowl was of soft stone, apparently steatite, which, when fresh, is easily fashioned with a knife. In Arabia the Badawin, and even the townspeople, use on journeys an earthen tube from five to six inches shorter than the English 'clay,' thicker in the tube, with a large bowl, and coloured yellowish-red. It contains a handful of tobacco, and the smoker emits puffs like a chimney. In some of these articles the bowl forms a rectangle with the tube; in others, the whole is an unbroken curve, like the old Turkish Meerschaum.VIII.— From 145 they take refuge in singing ; and, monotonous and dron- our p ac( j t ing as it is, their Modinha has yet an artless plaintiveness, 0 te ll 011% admirably suits the singer and the scenery.

It produced Ka'ab al-Ahbar, the celebrated A poet, to whom Mohammed gave the cloak which the tribes, Ottomans believe to have been taken by Sultan Salim 'folke from Egypt, and to have been converted under the the trc name of Khirkah Sharif, into the national Oriflamme. for bo There are some interesting ethnographical points hamiw about these Sinaitic clans—interesting at least to those to flog who would trace the genealogy of the great Arabian hemig family. Any one who knows the Badawin can see that Now t the Muzaynah are pure blood. Their brows are broad, isalloi their faces narrow, their features regular, and their eyes Ja'afat of a moderate size; whereas the other Tawarah 1 (Sinaitic) Badav clans are as palpably Egyptian. They have preserved that roundness of face which may still be seen in the Sphinx Rr j n? as in the modern Copt, and their eyes have that peculiar (Gen. s size, shape, and look, which the old Egyptian painters identifj attempted to express by giving to the profile, the form ^ of the full, organ.

When the learned doctor, Ab0148 Pilgrimage to Al-Madim Mohammed Ali's vigorous policy, and such the effects of even semi-civilisation, when its influence is brought to bear direct upon barbarism. To conclude this subject, the Tawarah still retain many characteristics of the Badawi race. The most good- humoured and sociable of men, they delight in a jest, and may readily be managed by kindness and courtesy. Yet they are passionate, nice upon points of honour, revengeful, and easily offended, where their peculiar pre judices are misunderstood. I have always found them pleasant companions, and deserving of respect, for their hearts are good, and their courage is beyond a doubt. Those travellers who complain of their insolence and extortion may have been either ignorant of their lan guage or offensive to them by assumption of superority, —in the Desert man meets man,—or physically unfitted to acquire their esteem. We journeyed on till near sunset through the wilderness without ennui. It is strange how the mind can be amused by scenery that presents so few objects to occupy it. But in such a country every slight modifica tion of form or colour rivets observation: the senses are sharpened, and the perceptive faculties, prone to sleep over a confused mass of natural objects, act vigorously when excited by the capability of embracing each detail. Moreover, Desert views are eminently suggestive; they Abdullah Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafe'i, returned from Meccah to the banks of the Nile, he mounted, it is said, a donkey belonging to one of the Asinarii of Bulak. Arriving at the Caravanserai, he gave the man ample fare, whereupon the Egyptian, putting forth his hand, and saying 44 hat' (give !) called for more. The doctor doubled the fee; still the double was demanded. At last the divine's purse was exhausted, and the proprietor of the donkey waxed insolent. A wandering Turk seeing this, took all the money from the Egyptian, paid him his due, solemnly kicked him, and returned the rest to Al- Shafe'i, who asked him his name—''Osman'—and his nation— the M Osmanli,'—blessed him, and prophesied to his. countrymen supremacy over the Fellahs and donkey boys of Egypt.h, VIII.— From 140 16 effects^ brought 1 a PP eal t0 the Future, not to the Past: they arouse because they are by no means memorial.

In such circumstances the mind is influenced through the body. Though your mouth glows, and your skin is parched, yet you feel no languor, the effect of humid heat; your lungs are lightened, your sight brightens, your memory recovers its tone, and your spirits become exuberant; your fancy and imagination are powerfully aroused, and the wildness and sublimity of the scenes around you stir up all the energies of your soul—whether for exertion, danger, or strife. Your improves ; you become frank and cordial, hospitable and single-minded: the hypocritical politeness and the slavery of civilisa tion are left behind you in the city. Your senses are quickened : they require no stimulants but air and exer cise,—in the Desert spirituous liquors excite only disgust. There is a keen enjoyment in mere animal existence. The sharp appetite disposes of the most indigesti ble food; Strabo and Abulfeda makes it synonymous with Auasis and Hyasis. I believe it to be a mere corruption of the Arabic Wady or Wah. Nothing can be more incorrect than the vulgar idea of an Arabian Oasis, except it be the popular conception of an Arabian Desert. One reads of ' isles of the sandy sea,' but one never sees them. The real ' Wady ' is, generally speaking, a rocky valley bisected by the bed of a mountain torrent, dry during the hot season. In such places the Badawin love to encamp, because they find food and drink,—water being always procurable by digging. When the supply is perennial, the Wady becomes the site of a village. The Desert is as unaptly compared to a 'sandy sea.' Most of the wilds of Arabia resemble the tract between Suez and Cairo; only the former are of primary formation, whereas the others are of a later date. Sand- heaps are found in every Desert, but sand-plains are a local feature, not the general face of the country. The Wilderness, east of the is mostly a hard dry earth, which requires only a monsoon to become highly productive; even where silicious sand covers the plain, the waters of a torrent, depositing humus or vegetable mould, bind tin particles together, and fit it for the reception of seed.VIII.—From 151 the sand is softer than a bed of down, and the purity of the air suddenly puts to flight a dire cohort of diseases. Hence it is that both sexes, and every age, the most material as well as the most imaginative of minds, the tamest citizen, the parson, the old maid, the peaceful student, the spoiled child of civilisation, all feel their hearts dilate, and their pulses beat strong, as they look down from their dromedaries upon the glorious Desert. Where do we hear of a traveller being disappointed by it ? It is another illustration of the ancient truth that Nature returns to man, however unworthily he has treated her. And believe me, when once your tastes have con formed to the tranquillity of such travel, you will suffer real pain in returning to the turmoil of civilisation. You will anticipate the bustle and the confusion of artificial life, its luxury and its false pleasures, with repugnance. Depressed in spirits, you will for a time after your return feel incapable of mental or bodily exertion. The air of cities will suffocate you, and the care-worn and cadaverous countenances of citizens will haunt you like a vision of judgment. 1 As the black shadow mounted in the Eastern sky, 3 1 turned off the road, and was suddenly saluted by a figure rising from a little hollow with an ' As' Salamu 'alaykum' of truly Arab sound. 3 I looked at the speaker for a moment without recognising him.

The Shafe'i school performs its devotions immediately after the sun has disappeared. 3 This salutation of peace is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observing traveller will easily make of it a shibboleth.152 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. my camel's halter without waiting for an answer, ' nakh'd 1 ' it {i .e. forced it to kneel), led me hurriedly to a carpet spread in a sandy hollow, pulled off my slippers, gave me cold water for ablution, told me that he had mistaken me at a distance for a ' Sherif ' (or Prince) of the Arabs, but was delighted to find himself in error; and urged me to hurry over ablution, otherwise that night would come on before we could say our prayers. It was Mohammed al-Basyuni, the Meccan boy of whom I had bought my pilgrim-garb at Cairo. There I had refused his companionship, but here for reasons of his own—one of them was an utter want of money,—he would take no excuse. When he prayed, he stood behind me, 2 thereby proving pliancy of conscience, for he suspected me from the first of being at least a heretic. After prayer he lighted a pipe, and immediately placed the snake-like tube in my hand; this is an argu ment which the tired traveller can rarely resist. He then began to rummage my saddle-bags ; he drew forth stores of provisions, rolls, water-melons, boiled eggs, and dates, and whilst lighting the fire and boiling the coffee, he man aged to distribute his own stock, which was neither plentiful nor first-rate, to the camel-men. Shaykh Nassar and his brother looked aghast at this movement, but the boy was inexorable. They tried a few rough hints, which he noticed by singing a Hindustani couplet that asserts the impropriety of anointing rats' heads with jasmine oil. They suspected abuse, and waxed cross; he acknow ledged this by deriding them. ' I have heard of Nasrs and Nasirs and Mansurs, but may Allah spare me the 1 To ' nakh ' in vulgar, as in classical, Arabic is to gurgle ' Ikh! ikh!' in the bottom of one's throat till the camel kneels down. We have no English word for this proceeding; but Anglo-Oriental trav ellers are rapidly naturalising the ' nakh.' 2 There are many qualifications necessary for an Imam—a leader of prayer; the first condition, of course, is orthodoxy.VIIL— From 153 mortification of a Nassar!' said the boy, relying upon my support. And I urged him on, wanting to see how the city Arab treats the countryman. He then took my tobacco-pouch from the angry Badawin, and in a stage- whisper reproved me for entrusting it to such thieves; insisting, at the same time, upon drinking all the coffee, so that the poor guides had to prepare some for them selves. He improved every opportunity of making mis chief. 'We have eaten water-melon!' cried Nassar, patting its receptacle in token of repletion. ' Dost thou hear, my lord, how they grumble ?—the impudent ruffians!' remarked Mohammed— melon ! that is to say, we ought to have eaten meat!' The Badawin, completely out of temper, told him not to trust himself among their hills. He seized a sword, and began capering about after the fashion of the East-Indian school of arms, and boasted that he would attack single- handed the whole clan, which elicited an ironical ' Allah ! Allah !' from the hearers. After an hour most amusingly spent in this way, I arose, and insisted upon mounting, much to the dissatis faction of my guides, who wished to sleep there. Shaykh Nassar and his brother had reckoned upon living gratis, for at least three days, judging it improbable that a soft Eftendi would hurry himself. When they saw the fair vision dissolve, they began to finesse : they induced the camel-man, who ran by the side of Mohammed's drom edary, to precede the animal—a favourite manoeuvre to prevent overspeed. Ordered to fall back, the man pleaded fatigue, and inability to walk. The boy Mohammed im mediately asked if I had any objection to dismount one d gurgle 'lit of my guides, and to let his weary attendant ride for an hour or so. I at once assented, and the Badawin obeyed me with ominous grumblings. When we resumed our march the melancholy Arabs had no song left in them; whereas Mohammed chaunted vociferously, and quoted154 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. bad Hindustani and worse Persian till silence was forcibly imposed upon him. The camel-men lagged behind, in order to prevent my dromedary advancing too fast, and the boy's guide, after dismounting, would stride along in front of us, under pretext of showing the way. And so we jogged on, now walking, then trotting, till the drome daries began to grunt with fatigue, and the Arabs clamoured for a halt. At midnight we reached the Central Station, and lay down under its walls to take a little rest. The dews fell heavily, wetting the sheets that covered us; but who cares for such trifles in the Desert ? The moon shone bright; 1 the breeze blew coolly, and the jackal sang a lullaby which lost no time in inducing the soundest sleep. As the Wolfs Tail 2 showed in the heavens we arose. Grey mists floating over the hills northwards gave the D^r al-Bayda, 3 the Pasha's Palace, the look of some old feudal castle. There was a haze in the atmos phere, which beautified even the face of Desolation. The swift flying Kata 4 sprang in noisy coveys from the road, and a stray gazelle paced daintily over the stony plain. As we passed by the Pilgrims' tree, 1 1 ' The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night,' (Psalm cxxi. 6). Easterns still believe firmly in the evil effects of moonlight upon the human frame,—from Sind to Abyssinia, the traveller will hear tales of wonder concerning it. 2 The Dum i Gurg, or wolfs tail, 4 is the Persian name for the first brushes of grey light which appear as forerunners of dawn. 3 Dar al-Bayda is a palace belonging to H.H. Abbas Pasha.

The dawn passed away in its delicious coolness, and sultry morning came on. Then day glared in its fierceness, and the noontide sun made the plain glow with terrible heat. Still we pressed onwards. At 3 p.m. we turned off the road into a dry water-course, which is not far from No. 13 Station. The sand was dotted with thedried-up leaves of the Datura, and strongly m perfumed by 'Shih,' a kind of Absinthe (Artemisia),' 2 _ the sweetest herb of the Desert.

E arly on the morning after my arrival, I arose, and consulted my new acquaintances about the means of recovering the missing property. They unanimously advised a visit to the governor, whom, however, they described to be a « Kalb ibn kalb,' (dog, son of a dog,) who never returned Moslems' salutations, and who thought all men dirt to be trodden under foot by the Turks. The boy Mohammed showed his by extracting from his huge Sahara-box a fine embroidered cap, and a grand peach-coloured coat, with which I was instantly invested; he dressed himself with similar magnif icence, and we then set out to the ' palace.' Ja'afar Bey,—he has since been deposed,—then occu pied the position of judge, officer commanding, collector of customs, and magistrate of Suez. He was a Mir-liwa, or brigadier-general, and had some reputation as a soldier, together with a slight tincture of European science and language. The large old Turk received me most superciliously, disdained all return of salam, and, fixing upon me two little eyes like gimlets, demanded my business. I stated that one Shaykh Nur, my Hindi ser vant, had played me false; therefore I required permission to break into the room supposed to contain my effects. He asked my profession.

The obnoxious measure was, however, unnecessary. As we entered the Caravanserai, there appeared at the door the black face of Shaykh Nur, looking, though accom panied by sundry fellow-countrymen, uncommonly as if he merited and expected the bamboo. He had, by his own account, been seduced into the festivities of a coal- hulk, manned by Lascars, and the vehemence of his self- accusation saved him from the chastisement which I had I determined to administer. I must now briefly describe the party of Meccah and e ^ Madinah men into which fate threw me : their names will unanim® so frequently appear in the following pages, that a few however, I words about their natures will not be misplaced. First of all comes Omar Effendi,—so called in honour, ns, and t — a Daghistani or East-Circassian, the grandson of a :r footbjl Hanafi Mufti at Al-Madinah, and the son of a Shaykh smrfml Rakb, an officer whose duty it is to lead dromedary-cara- e embroito vans.

The Arab, however, knows by experience, that though habitual exposure of the HI lameuuj sca jp to a b urn i n g sun ma y harden the skull, it seldom fails to lly amused damage its precious contents.

We were intimate vantage enough on the road, when he borrowed from me a little f or a { e money.

It was favourable to me: I lent them Egyptian money, and bargained for repayment in the currency of Al-Hijaz, thereby gaining the exchange, which is sometimes sixteen per cent. This was done, not so much for the sake of profit, as with the view of becoming a Hatim, 1 by a ' never mind ' on settling day. My companions having received these small sums, became affectionate and eloquent in my praise : they asked me to make one of their number at meals for the future, over whelmed me with questions, insisted upon a present of sweetmeats, detected in me a great man under a cloud,— perhaps my claims to being a Darwaysh assisted them to this discovery,—and declared that I should perforce be their guest at Meccah and Al-Madinah. On all occasions precedence was forced upon me ; my opinion was the first consulted, and no project was settled without my con currence : briefly, Abdullah the Darwaysh suddenly found himself a person of consequence. This elevation led me into an imprudence which might have cost me dear; aroused the only suspicion about me ever expressed during the summer's tour. My friends had looked at my clothes, overhauled my medicine chest, and criticised my pistols; they sneered at my copper-cased watch, 2 and remembered having seen a compass at Constantinople. Therefore I imagined they would think little about a sextant. This was a mistake. The boy Mohammed, 1 1 A well-known Arab chieftain, whose name has come to stand for generosity itself. 2 This being an indispensable instrument for measuring distances, I had it divested of gold case, and provided with a facing carefully stained and figured with Arabic numerals. In countries where few can judge of a watch by its works, it is as well to secure its safety by making the exterior look as mean as possible. The watches worn by respectable people in Al-Hijaz are almost always old silver pieces, of the turnip shape, with hunting cases and an outer etui of thick leather. Mostly they are of Swiss or German manufacture, and they find their way into Arabia via Constantinople and Cairo.M(CCS.i IX.—Suez. 167 til e to for 3 g the e This with ' on sei wllsums,^ ^hey asked m ^ future^ P on a pre®!. un deraclo4. 1 assisted tbi ould perforai On alloccat nion wasthei &lt;vithout raj® ih suddenlyit elevation ledi s cost me ! ever lad looked ati md criticisedi ,sed watch, 1 1 Constantiiof k little about )y Mohammd has come to 4 measuring distB 1 a facing catefi countries Are t 1 secure its sale!; he watches wo: old silver pi® ture, and they iro. afterwards learned, 1 waited only my leaving the room to declare that the would-be Haji was one of the Infidels from India, and a council sat to discuss the case. For tunately for me, Omar Effendi had looked over a letter which I had written to Haji Wali that morning, and he had at various times received categorical replies to certain questions in high theology. He felt himself justified in declaring, ex cathedra, the boy Mohammed's position per fectly untenable. And Shaykh Hamid, who looked forward to being my host, guide, and debtor in general, and probably cared scantily for catechism or creed, swore that the light of Al-Islam was upon my countenance, and, consequently, that the boy Mohammed was a pauper, a ' fakir,' an owl, a cut-off one, 2 a stranger, and a Wah- habi (heretic), for daring to impugn the faith of a brother believer. 3 The scene ended with a general abuse of the acute youth, who was told on all sides that he had no shame, and was directed to ' fear Allah.' I was struck with the expression of my friends' countenances when they saw the sextant, and, determining with a sigh to 1 On my return to Cairo, Omar Effendi, whom I met accidentally in the streets, related the story to me. I never owned having played a part, to avoid shocking his prejudices; and though he must have suspected me,—for the general report was, that an Englishman, dis guised as a Persian, had performed the pilgrimage, measured the country, and sketched the buildings,—he had the gentlemanly feeling never to allude to the past. We parted, when I went to India, on the best of terms. 2 Munkati'a—one cut off (from the pleasures and comforts of life). In Al-Hijaz, as in England, any allusion to poverty is highly offensive. 3 The Koran expressly forbids a Moslem to discredit the word of any man who professes his belief in the Saving Faith. The greatest offence of the Wahhabis is their habit of designating all Moslems that belong to any but their own sect by the opprobrious name of Kafirs or infidels. This, however, is only the Koranic precept; in practice a much less trustful spirit prevails.168 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah leave it behind, I prayed five times a day for nearly a week. We all agreed not to lose an hour in securing places on board some vessel bound for Yambu'; and my com panions, hearing that my passport as a British Indian was scarcely en regie, earnestly advised me to have it signed by the governor without delay, whilst they occupied themselves about the harbour. They warned me that if I displayed the Turkish Tazkirah given me at the citadel of Cairo, I should infallibly be ordered to await the cara van, and lose their society and friendship. Pilgrims arriving at Alexandria, be it known to the reader, are. divided into bodies, and distributed by means of passports to the three great roads, namely, Suez, Kusayr (Cosseir), and the Hajj route by land round the Gulf of al-'Akabah. After the division has once been made, government turns a deaf ear to the representations of individuals. The Bey of Suez has an order to obstruct pilgrims as much as possible till the end of the season, when they are hurried down that way, lest they should arrive at Meccah too late. 1 As most of the Egyptian high officials have boats, which sail up the Nile laden with pilgrims and return freighted with corn, the government naturally does its utmost to force the delays and discomforts of this line upon strangers. 2 And as those who travel by the Hajj route must spend money in the Egyptian territories at least fifteen days longer than they would if allowed to 1 Towards the end of the season, poor pilgrims are forwarded gratis, by order of government. But, to make such liberality as inexpensive as possible, the Pasha compels ship-owners to carry one pilgrim per 9 ardebs (about 5 bushels each), in small, and 1 per 11 in large vessels. 2 I was informed by a Prussian gentleman, holding an official appointment under His Highness the Pasha, at Cairo, that 300,000 ardebs of grain were annually exported from Kusayr to Jeddah. The rest is brought down the Nile for consumption in Lower Egypt, and export to Euro je.I IX.—Suez. i6g ' 0r embark at once from Suez, the Bey very properly assists them in the former and obstructs them in the placti latter case.

My last hope at Suez was to obtain assistance are Wtl from Mr. West, then H.B.M.'s Vice-Consul, and since Meccah to made Consul. I therefore took the boy Mohammed with have boats, me&gt; choosing him on purpose, and excusing the step to and retai m y companions by concocting an artful fable about my ■Uy ^ having been, in Afghanistan, a benefactor to the British of thisliii nation.

Those who have bought goods for the Jeddah market at three months' credit will therefore have to meet their acceptances for merchandise still warehoused at the Egyptian port. This strange contrast to free-trade principle is another proof that protection benefits only one party, the pro tected, while it is detrimental to the interests of the other party, the public.' To these remarks of Mr. Levick's, I have only to add that the government supports the Farzah with all the energy of protectionists. A letter from Mr. (now Sir) John Drummond Hay was insufficient to induce the Bey of Suez to break through the rule of rotation in favour of certain princes from Morocco. The recom mendations of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe met with no better fate ; and all Mr. West's good will could not pro- 1 The rate of freight is at present (1853) about forty shillings per ton—very near the same paid by the P. and O. Company for coals carried from Newcastle via the Cape to Suez. Were the ' Farzah' abolished, freight to Jeddah would speedily fall to 15 or 16 shillings per ton. Passengers from Suez to Jeddah are sometimes charged as much as 6 or even 8 dollars for standing room—personal baggage forming another pretext for extortion—and the higher orders of pilgrims, occupying a small portion of the cabin, pay about 12 dollars. These first and second class fares would speedily be reduced, by abolishing protection, to 3 and 6 dollars. Note to Second Edition.— The ' Farzah,' I may here observe, has been abolished by Sa'id Pasha since the publication of these lines: the effects of 'free trade ' are exactly what were predicted by Mr. Levick. 2 The principal trade from Suez is to Jeddah, Kusayr supplying Yambu'. The latter place, however, imports from Suez wheat, beans, cheese, biscuit, and other provisions for return pilgrims.172 Pilgrimage toAl-Madimh cure me a vessel out of her turn. 1 We were forced to rely upon our own exertions, and the activity of Sa'ad ' n t ^ e ' the Demon.

In the first place, we should have paid less for the whole of a privileged vessel, than we did for our wretched Shaykl quarters on the deck of the pilgrim-ship; and, secondly, we might have touched at any port we pleased, so as to do a little business in the way of commerce. 2 Afterwards called by Sir R. F. Burton the 'Golden Wire.' — E d. 3 For the ' Sath,' or poop, the sum paid by each was seven Riyals. I was, therefore, notably cheated by Sa'ad the Demon. The unhappy women in the 'Kamrah,' or cabin, bought suffocation at the rate of 6 dollars each, as I was afterwards informed, and the third class, in the 'Taht,' or amidships and forward, contributed from 3 to 5 Riyals. But, as usual on these occasions, there was no prix fixe; every man was either overcharged or undercharged, according to his means or his necessities. We had to purchase our own water, but the ship was to supply us with fuel for cooking.

Suez as a ' watering-place ' is duller even than Dover. The only society we found, excepting an occasional visitor, was that of a party of Egyptian women, who with their husbands and families occupied some rooms adjo ining ours. At first they were fierce, and used bad language, when the boy Mohammed and I,—whilst Omar Effendi was engaged in prayer, and the rest were wandering about the town,—ventured to linger in the cool passage, where they congregated, or to address a facetious phrase to them. But hearing that I was a Hakim-bashi—for fame had promoted me to the rank of a ' Physician General' at Suez —all discovered some ailments. They began prudently with requesting me to display the effects of my drugs by dosing myself, but they ended submissively by swallow ing the nauseous compounds. To this succeeded a primitive form of flirtation, which mainly consisted of the demand direct. The most charming of the party was one Fattumah 1 , a plump-personed dame, fast verging upon her thirtieth year, fond of a little flattery, and possessing, like all her people, a most voluble tongue. The refrain of every conversation was ' Marry me, O Fattumah! 0 daughter! O female pilgrim !' In vain the lady would reply, with a coquettish movement of the sides, a toss of the head, and a flirting manipulation of her head-veil, to join me in these bathings. As a general rule, the Western Arabs avoid cold water, from a belief that it causes fever. When Mr, C. Cole, H.B.M.'s Vice-Consul, arrived at Jeddah, the people of the place, seeing that he kept up his Indian habits, advised him strongly to drop them. He refused ; but unhappily he soon caught a fever, which confirmed them all in their belief. When Arabs wish to cool the skin after a journey, they wash with a kind of fuller's earth called ' Tafl,' or with a thin paste of henna, and then anoint the body with oil or butter. i An incrementative form of the name ' Fatimah,' very common in Egypt. Fatimah would mean a 'weaner'—Fattumah, a ' great weaner.' By the same barbarism Khadijah becomes ' Khaddugah'; Am'mah, 'Ammunah'; andNafisah, ' Naffusah,' on the banks of the Nile.IX.— Suez. 175 ' I am mated, O young man! '—it was agreed that she, being a person of polyandrous propensities, could support the weight of at least three matrimonial engagements. Sometimes the entrance of the male Fellahs 1 interrupted these little discussions, but people of our respectability and nation were not to be imposed upon by such hus bands. In their presence we only varied the style of conversation — inquiring the amount of ' Mahr,' or marriage settlement, deriding the cheapness of woman hood in Egypt, and requiring to be furnished on the spot with brides at the rate of ten shillings a head. 2 More often the amiable Fattumah—the fair sex in this country, though passing frail, have the best tempers in the world- would laugh at our impertinences. Sometimes vexed by our imitating her Egyptian accent, mimicking her ges tures, and depreciating her country-women, 8 she would wax wroth, and order us to be gone, and stretch out her forefinger—a sign that she wished to put out our eyes, or adjure Allah to cut the hearts out of our bosoms. Then 1 The palmy days of the Egyptian husband, when he might use the stick, the sword, or the sack with impunity, are, in civilised places at least, now gone by. The wife has only to complain to the Kazi, or to the governor, and she is certain of redress. This is right in the abstract, but in practice it acts badly. The fair sex is so unruly in this country, that strong measures are necessary to coerce it, and in the arts of deceit men have here little or no chance against women. 2 The amount of settlement being, among Moslems as among Christians, the test of a bride's value,—moral and physical,—it will readily be understood that our demand was more facetious than complimentary, 3 The term Misriyah (an Egyptian woman) means in Al-Hijaz and the countries about it, a depraved character. Even the men own unwillingly to being Egyptians, for the free-born never forget that the banks of the Nile have for centuries been ruled by the slaves of slaves. ' He shall be called an Egyptian,' is a denunciation which has been strikingly fulfilled, though the country be no longer the 'basest of kingdoms.'176 Pilgrimage to A the ' Marry me, O Fattumah, O daughter, 0 female I attrit pilgrim!' would give way to Y'al Ago-o-oz!

' It appears now exe that the number of pilgrims who pass through Suez to ^ ree g ri Meccah has of late been steadily on the decrease. When I first came here (in 1838) the pilgrims who annually em- 1 Tlli! barked at this port amounted to between 10,000 and 12 ,000, the shipping was more numerous, and the mer- -'Xokroar chants were more affluent. 1 I have ascertained from a not appea special register kept in the government archives that in Africa, the Moslem year 1268 (a.d. 1851-52) the exact number a lar ^p( that passed through was 4893.'

The Suezians live well, and their bazar is abundantly stocked with meat and clarified butter brought from Sinai, and fowls, corn, and vegetables from the Sharkiyah province; fruit is supplied by Cairo as well as by the Sharkiyah, and wheat conveyed down the Nile in flood to the capital is carried on camel-back across the Desert. At sunrise they eat the Fatur, or breakfast, which in summer consists of a ' fatirah,' a kind of muffin, or of bread and treacle.

And this, indeed, is his chief merit as a soldier. InW. 1 He has a certain mechanical dexterity in the use of arms, and an Egyptian regiment will fire a volley as correctly as a battalion at Chobham. But when the head, and not the hands, is required, he notably fails. The reason of his superiority in the field is his peculiar stubborness, and this, together with his powers of digestion and of enduring hardship on the line of march, is the quality that makes him terrible to his old conqueror, the Turk. 2 1 The government takes care to prevent bloodshed in the towns by disarming the country people, and by positively forbidding the carrying of weapons. Moreover, with a wise severity, it punishes ail parties concerned in a quarrel, where blood is drawn, with a heavy fine and the bastinado de rigueur. Hence it is never safe, except as a European, to strike a man, and the Egyptians generally confine them selves to collaring and pushing each other against the walls. Even in the case of receiving gross abuse, you cannot notice it as you would elsewhere. You must take two witnesses,—respectable men,—and prove the offence before the Zabit, who alone can punish the offender. , 2 Note to Third (1873) Edition.—I revisited Suez in Septem ber, 1869, and found it altered for the better. The population had i risen from 6,000 to 20,000. The tumble-down gateway was still there, but of the old houses—including the 11 George Inn,' whose front had \ been repaired—I recognised only four, and they looked mean by the side of the fine new buildings. In a few years ancient Suez will be no more. The bazars are not so full of filth and flies, now that ' pilgrims pass straight through and hardly even encamp. The sweet water Canal renders a Hammam possible; coffee is no longer hot ^ saltish water, and presently irrigation will cover with fields and gardens the desert plain extending to the feet of Jabal Atakah. The noble works of the Canal Maritime, which should in justice be called the 44 Lesseps Canal,' shall soon transform Clysma into a modern and civilised city. The railway station, close to the hotel, the new British hospital, the noisy Greek casino, the Prankish shops, the^ in the torn r « t««. glk IX.— 185 puffing steamers, and the ringing of morning bells, gave me a novel impression. Even the climate has been changed by filling up the Timsch Lakes. Briefly, the hat is now at home in Suez. Note to Fourth (1879) Edition.— The forecast in the last paragraph has not been fulfilled. I again visited Suez in 1877-78, and found that it had been ruined by the Canal leaving it out of line. In fact, another Suez is growing up about the 11 New Docks,'* while the old town is falling to pieces. For this and other Egyptian matters, see 44 The Gold Mines of Midian ' (by Sir Richard Burton).the pilgrim ship. The larger craft anchor some three or four miles from the Suez pier, so that it is necessary to drop down in a skiff or shore-boat. Immense was the confusion at the eventful hour of our departure. Suppose us gathered upon the beach, on the morning of a fiery July day, carefully watching our hurriedly-packed goods and chattels, surrounded by a mob of idlers, who are not too proud to pick up waifs and strays; whilst pilgrims are rushing about apparently mad; and friends are weeping, acquaintances are vociferating adieux; boatmen are demanding fees, shopmen are claim ing debts; women are shrieking and talking with inconceiv able power, and children are crying,—in short, for an hour or so we stand in the thick of a human storm. To confound confusion, the boatmen have moored their skiff half a dozen yards away from the shore, lest the porters should be unable to make more than double their fare from the Hajis. Again the Turkish women make a hideous noise, as they are carried off struggling vainly in brawny arms; the children howl because their mothers howl; and the men scold and swear, because in such scenes none may be silent. The moment we had embarked, each indi vidual found that he or she had missed something of vital importance,—a pipe, a child, a box, or a water-melon; and naturally all the servants were in the bazars, whenX.—The Pilg they should have been in the boat. Briefly, despite the rage of the sailors, who feared being too late for a second trip, we stood for some time on the beach before putting off. From the shore we poled to the little pier, where sat the Bey in person to perform a final examination of our passports. Several were detected without the necessary document. Some were bastinadoed, others were peremp torily ordered back to Cairo, and the rest were allowed to proceed. At about ioa.m. (6th July) we hoisted sail, and ran down the channel leading to the roadstead. On our way we had a specimen of what we might expect from our fellow- passengers, the Maghrabi. 1 A boat crowded with these i Men of the Maghrab, or Western Africa; the vulgar plural is Maghrabin, generally written 11 Mogrebyn.' May not the singular form of this word have given rise to the Latin 14 Maurus/' by elision of the Ghayn, to Italians an unpronounceable consonant ? From Maurus comes the Portuguese ' Moro,' and our 11 Moor. M When Vasco de Gama reached Calicut, he found there a tribe of Arab colonists, who in religion and in language were the same as the people of Northern Africa,—for this reason he called them M Moors. ,, This was explained long ago by Vincent (Periplus, lib. 3), and lately by Prichard (Natural History of Man). I repeat it because it has been my fate to hear, at a meeting of a learned society in London, a gentleman declare, that in Eastern Africa he found a people calling themselves Moors. Maghrabin—Westerns,—then would be opposed to Sharkiyin, Easterns, the origin of our 41 Saracen.' From Gibbon downwards many have discussed the history of this word; but few expected in the nineteenth century to see a writer on Eastern subjects assert, with Sir John Mandeville, that these people 11 properly, ben clept Sarrazins of Sarra.' The learned M. Jomard, who never takes such original views of things, asks a curious question :— 0 Mais com ment un son aussi distinct que le Chine aurait~il pu se confondre avec le Syn ^ et # pour un mot aussi connu que charq; comment aurait-on pu se tromper a I'omission des points ?' Simply because the word Saracens came to us through the Greeks (Ptolemy uses it), who have no such sound as sh in their language, and through the Italian which, hostile to the harsh sibilants of Oriental dialects, generally melts sh down into s. So the historical word Hashshash- iyun—hemp-drinker,—civilised by the Italians into &lt;, assassino,' ,188 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. ruffians ran alongside of us, and, before we could organise a defence, about a score of them poured into our vessel. They carried things too with a high hand, laughed at us, and seemed quite ready to fight. My Indian boy, who happened to let slip the word ' Muarras,' narrowly escaped a blow with a palm stick, which would have felled a camel. They outnumbered us, and they were armed ; so that, on this occasion, we were obliged to put up with their insolence. Our Pilgrim Ship, the Silk al-Zahab, or the ' Golden Wire,' was a Sambuk, of about 400 ardebs (fifty tons), with narrow, wedge-like bows, a clean water-line, a sharp keel, and undecked, except upon the poop, which was high enough to act as a sail in a gale of wind. She carried two masts, raking imminently forwards, the main being considerably larger than the mizzen; the former was provided with a huge triangular latine, very deep in the tack, but the second sail was unaccountably wanting. She had no means of reefing, no compass, no log, no sounding lines, no spare ropes, nor even the suspicion of a chart: in her box-like cabin and ribbed hold there was something which savoured of close connection between her model and that of the Indian Toni, 1 or ' dug-out.' became, as all know, an expression of European use. But if any one adverse to 'etymological fancies' objects to my deriving Maurus from ' Maghrab,' let him remember Johnson's successfully tracing the course of the metamorphosis of 'dies' into 'jour.' An even more peculiar change we may discover in the word ' elephant.' 'Pilu' in Sanscrit, became 'pil' in old Persian, which ignores short final vowels; 'fil,' and, with the article,' Al-fil,' in Arabic, which supplies the place of p (an unknown letter to it), by f; and elephas in Greek, which is fond of adding as ' to Arabic words, as in the cases of Aretas (Haris) and Obodas (Obayd). ' A name,' says Humboldt, 'often becoming a historical monument, and the etymological analysis of language, however it may be divided, is attended by valuable results.' 1 The Toni or Indian canoe is the hollowed-out trunk of a tree,—near Bombay generally a mango. It must have been the firstX.—The Pilg 189 Such, probably, were the craft which carried old Sesostris across the Red Sea to Deir; such were the cruisers which once every three years left Ezion-Geber for Tarshish; such the transports of which 130 were re quired to convey iElius Gallus, with his 10,000 men. ' Bakhshish' was the last as well as the first odious sound I heard in Egypt. The owner of the shore-boat would not allow us to climb the sides of our vessel before paying him his fare, and when we did so, he asked for Bakhshish. If Easterns would only imitate the example of Europeans,—I never yet saw an Englishman give Bakhshish to a soul,—the nuisance would soon be done away with. But on this occasion all my companions complied with the request, and at times it is unpleasant to be singular. The first look at the interior of our vessel showed a hopeless sight; Ali Murad, the greedy owner, had promised to take sixty passengers in the hold, but had stretched the number to ninety-seven. Piles of boxes and luggage in every shape and form filled the ship from stem to stern, and a torrent of Hajis were pouring over the sides like ants into the East-Indian sugar-basin. The poop, too, where we had taken our places, was covered with goods, and a number of pilgrims had estab lished themselves there by might, not by right. Presently, to our satisfaction, appeared Sa'ad the Demon, equipped as an able seaman, and looking most unlike the proprietor of two large boxes full of valuable merchandise. This energetic individual instantly pre pared for action. With our little party to back him, he speedily cleared the poop of intruders and their stuff by the simple process of pushing or rather throwing them off it into the pit below. We then settled down as comfortably as we could ; three Syrians, a married Turk with his wife and family, the Rais or captain of the vessel, step in advance from that simplest form of naval architecture, the ' Catamaran ' of Madras and Aden.190 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah with a portion of his crew, and our seven selves, com posing a total of eighteen human beings, upon a space certainly not exceeding ten feet by eight. The cabin—a miserable box about the size of the poop, and three feet high—was stuffed, like the hold of a slave ship, with fifteen wretches, children and women, and the other ninety-seven were disposed upon the luggage or squatted on the bulwarks. Having some experience in such matters, and being favoured by fortune, I found a spare bed-frame slung to the ship's side; and giving a dollar to its owner, a sailor—who flattered himself that, because it was his, he would sleep upon it,—I instantly appro priated it, preferring any hardship outside, to the condition of a packed herring inside, the place of torment. Our Maghrabis were fine-looking animals from the deserts about Tripoli and Tunis; so savage that, but a few weeks ago, they had gazed at the cock-boat, and wondered how long it would be growing to the size of the ship that was to take them to Alexandria. Most of them were sturdy young fellows, round-headed, broad-shouldered, tall and large-limbed, with frowning eyes, and voices in a perpetual roar. Their manners were rude, and their faces full of fierce contempt or insolent familiarity. A few old men were there, with countenances expressive of intense ferocity; women as savage and full of fight as men; and handsome boys with shrill voices, and hands always upon their daggers. The women were mere bundles of dirty white rags. The males were clad in ' Burnus'—brown or striped woollen cloaks with hoods ; they had neither turband nor tarbush, trusting to their thick curly hair or to the prodigious hardness of their scalps as a defence against the sun; and there was not a slipper nor a shoe amongst the party. Of course all were armed ; but, fortunately for us, none had any thing more formidable than a cut-and-thrust dagger about ten inches long. These Maghrabis travel in hordes under^ X. — The 191 i e lves )% a leader who obtains the temporary title of {&lt; Maula,'— on a space the master.

The enemy showed no love of fair play, and never appeared contented unless five or six of them were setting upon a single man. This made matters worse. The weaker of course drew their daggers, and a few bad wounds were soon given and received. In a few minutes five men were completely disabled, and the victors began to dread the consequences of their victory. Then the fighting stopped, and, as many could not find places, it was agreed that a deputation should wait upon Ali Murad, the owner, to inform him of the crowded state of the vessel. After keeping us in expectation at least three hours, he appeared in a row-boat, preserving a respectful distance, and informed us that any one who pleased might quit the ship and take back his fare. This left the case exactly as it was before; none would abandon his party to go on shore: so Ali Murad rowed off towards Suez, giving us a parting injunction to be good, and not fight; to trust in Allah, and that Allah would make all things easy to us. His departure was the signal for a second fray, which in its accidents differed a little from the first. During the previous disturbance we kept our places with weapons in our hands. This time we were summoned by the Maghrabis to relieve their difficulties, by taking about half a dozen of them on the poop. Sa'ad the Demon at once rose with an oath, and threw amongst us a bundle of ' Nabbut'—goodly ashen staves six feet long, thick as a man's wrist, well greased, and tried in many a rough bout. He shouted to us ' Defend yourselves if you don't wish to be the meat of the Maghrabis !' and to the enemy—' Dogs and sons of dogs! now shall you see what the children of the Arab are.' ' I am Omar of Daghistan ! ' 'I am Abdullah the son of Joseph !' 'I am Sa'ad the Demon! we ex claimed, ' renowning it' by this display of name and patronymic. To do our enemies justice, they showed noX.— The Pilgrim 193 sign of flinching; they swarmed towards the poop like angry hornets, and encouraged each other with cries of ' Allaho akbar! ' But we had a vantage-ground about four feet above them, and their palm-sticks and short daggers could do nothing against our terrible quarter- staves. In vain the ' Jacquerie,' tried to scale the poop and to overpower us by numbers; their courage only secured them more broken heads. At first I began to lay on load with really fearing to kill some one with such a weapon ; but it soon became evident that the Maghrabis' heads and shoulders could bear and did require the utmost exertion of strength. Presently a thought struck me. A large earthen jar full of drinking water, 1 —in its heavy frame of wood the weight might have been 100 lbs.,—stood upon the edge of the poop, and the thick of the fray took place beneath. Seeing an opportunity, I crept up to the jar, and, without attracting attention, rolled it down by a smart push with the shoulder upon the swarm of assailants. The fall caused a shriller shriek to rise above the ordinary din, for heads, limbs, and bodies were sorely bruised by the weight, scratched by the broken potsherds, and wetted by the sudden discharge. A fear that some thing worse might be coming made the Maghrabis shnk off towards the end of the vessel. After a few minutes, we, sitting in grave silence, received a deputation of individuals in whity-brown Burnus, spotted and striped with what Mephistopheles calls a « curious juice.' They solicited peace, which we granted upon the condition that they would pledge themselves to keep it.

I. j ^194 Pilgyimage toAl-M cidiuah rags. We owed this victory entirely to our own exer tions, and the meek Omar was by far the fiercest of the party. Our Rais, as we afterwards learned, was an old fool who could do nothing but call for the Fatihah, 1 claim Bakhshish at every place where we moored for the night, and spend his leisure hours in the ' Caccia del Mediterraneo.' Our crew consisted of half a dozen Egyptian lads, who, not being able to defend themselves, were periodically chastised by the Maghrabis, especially when any attempt was made to cook, to fetch water, or to prepare a pipe. 2 At length, about 3 p.m. on the 6th July, 1853, we shook out the sail, and, as it bellied in the favourable wind, we recited the Fatihah with upraised hands which we afterwards drew down our faces. 8 As the ' Golden Wire ' started from her place, I could not help casting one wistful look upon the British flag floating over the Consulate. But the momentary regret was stifled by the heart-bounding which prospects of an adventure excite, and by the real pleasure of leaving Egypt. I had lived there a stranger in the land, and a hapless life it had been: in the streets every man's face, as he looked upon the Persian, was the face of a foe.

The ships of the Red Sea—infamous region of rocks, reefs, and shoals—cruise along the coast by day, and at night lay-to in the first cove they find; they do not sail when it blows hard, and as in winter time the weather is often stormy and the light of day does not last long, the voyage is intolerably slow. 1 At sunset we stayed our adventurous course; and, still within sight of Suez, com fortably anchored under the lee of Jabal Atakah, the ' Mountain of Deliverance, 2 ' the butt-end of Jabal Joshi. We were now on classic waters. The Eastern shore was dotted with the little grove of palm-trees which clusters around the Uyun Musa, or Moses' Wells; and on the west, between two towering ridges, lay the mouth of the valley (Badiyah, or Wady Tawarik, or Wady Musa) down which, according to Father Sicard, 3 the Israelites fled to As far as my experience goes, our roughness and brusquerie are mere politeness compared with what passes between Easterns. At the same time it must be owned that I have seen the worst of it. 1 It was far safer and more expeditious in Al-Adrisi's day (a.d. i 154), w T hen the captain used to sit on the poop ' furnished with numerous and useful instruments'; when he ^ sounded the shallows, and by his knowledge of the depths could direct the helmsman where to steer.' 2 In the East it is usual, when commencing a voyage or a journey, to make a short day's work, in order to be at a convenient distance for returning, in case of any essential article having been forgotten. 3 A Jesuit missionary who visited the place in a.d. 1720, and described it in a well-known volume. As every eminent author, however, monopolises a 'crossing,' and since the head of the Suez creek, as is shown by its old watermark, has materially changed within no very distant period, it is no wonder that the question is still sub judice, and that there it will remain most probably till the end of time. The Christians have two equally favourite lines : the Mos lems patronise one so impossible, that it has had attractions enoughig6 Pilgrimage to Al -Madina Meccah. the Sea of Sedge. 1 The view was by no means deficient in a sort of barbarous splendour. Verdure there was none, but under the violet and orange tints of the sky the chalky rocks became heaps of topazes, and the brown-burnt ridges masses of amethyst. The rising mists, here silvery white, there deeply rosy, and the bright blue of the waves, 2 lining long strips of golden sand, compensated for the want of softness by a semblance of savage gorgeous- ness. Next morning (7th July), before the cerulean hue had vanished from the hills, we set sail. It was not long before we came to a proper sense of our position. The box con taining my store of provisions, and, worse still, my opium, was at the bottom of the hold, perfectly un approachable ; we had, therefore, the pleasure of break ing our fast on ' Mare's skin,' 3 and a species of biscuit, hard as a stone and quite as tasteless. During the day, whilst insufferable splendour reigned above, the dashing of the waters below kept my nest in a state of perpetual drench. At night rose a cold, bright moon, with dews falling so thick and clammy that the skin felt as though it would never be dry again. It is, also, by no means pleas- to fix their choice. It extends from Zafaran Point to Hammam Bluffs, ten miles of deep water. 1 The Hebrew name of this part of the Red Sea. In a communi cation lately made to the Royal Geographical Society, I gave my reasons for believing that the Greeks borrowed their Erythraean Sea from the Arabic ' Sea of Himyar.' 2 Most travellers remark that they have never seen a brighter blue than that of the Red Sea.

And as under all circumstances in the East, dozing is one's chief occupation, the reader will understand that the want of it left me in utter, utter idleness. The gale was light that day, and the sunbeams were fire; our crew preferred crouching in the shade of the sail to taking advantage of what wind there was. In spite of our impatience we made but little way. near evening time we anchored on a tongue of sand, about two miles distant from the well-known and picturesque heights called by the Arabs Hammam Faraun, 1 which —' like giants stand To sentinel enchanted land. 11 The strip of coarse quartz and sandstone gravel is ob' viously the offspring of some mountain torrent; it stretches southwards, being probably disposed in that direction by the currents of the sea as they receive the deposit. The distance of the ' Hammam Bluffs ' pre vented my visiting them, which circumstance I regretted the less as they have been described by pens equal to the task. That evening we enjoyed ourselves upon clean sand, whose surface, drifted by the wind into small yellow waves, was easily converted by a little digging and heap ing up, into the coolest and most comfortable of couches. Indeed, after the canescent heat of the day, and the tossing of our ill-conditioned vessel, we should have been contented with lodgings far less luxurious. Fuel was readily collected, and while some bathed, others ^ fiiiiMii ^ _ 1 ' Pharaoh's hot baths,' which in our maps are called ' Hum- - mum Bluffs.'

Shaykh Nur had fortunately a line; we had been successful in fishing; a little rice also had been bought; with this boiled, and rock-cod broiled upon the charcoal, we made a dinner that caused every one to forget the sore griev ance of 'Mare's skin' and stone-hard biscuit. A few Maghrabis had ventured on shore, the Rais having terrified the others by threatening them with those ' bogies,' the Badawin—and they offered us Kuskusu 1 in exchange for fish. As evening fell, we determined, before sleeping, to work upon their 'morale' as effec tually as we had attacked their physique. Shaykh Hamid stood up and indulged them with the Azan, or call to prayers, pronounced after the fashion of Al- Madinah. 2 They performed their devotions in lines ranged behind us as a token of respect, and when wor ship was over we were questioned about the Holy City till we grew tired of answering. Again our heads and shoulders, our hands and knees, 8 were kissed, but this time in devotion, not in penitence. My companions could scarcely understand half the rugged words which the Maghrabis used, 4 as their dialect was fresh from the 1 One of the numerous species of what the Italians generally call ' Pasta.' The material is wheaten or barley flour rolled into small round grains. In Barbary it is cooked by steaming, and served up with hard boiled eggs and mutton, sprinkled with red pepper. Ther&gt;e Badawi Maghrabis merely boiled it. 2 The Azan is differently pronounced, though similarly worded by every orthodox nation in Al-Islam. 3 The usual way of kissing the knee is to place the finger tips upon it, and then to raise them to the mouth. It is an action denoting great humility, and the condescending superior who is not an immediate master returns the compliment in the same way. 4 The Maghrabi dialect is known to be the harshest and most guttural form of Arabic. It owes this unenviable superiority to its frequency of ' Sukun,' or the quiescence of one or more conson ants','—' K'lab,' for instance,for 'Kilab,' and ' 'Msik' for ' Amsik.'X.— The Pilg 199 a . hoIe opati distant Desert.

Fair visions of dates doomed to the Limbo of things which should have been! The grey dawn (8th July) looked down upon us in difficulties. The water is deep near this coast; we had anchored at high tide close to the shore, and the ebb had left us high and dry. When this fact became apparent, a storm was upon the point of breaking. The Maghrabis, but for our interference, would have bas tinadoed the Rais, who, they said with some reason, ought to have known better. When this phase of feeling passed away, they applied themselves to physical efforts. All except the women and children, who stood on the shore encouraging their relatives with shrill quaverings, threw themselves into the water; some pushed, others applied their shoulders to the vessel's side, and all used their lungs with might and main. But the 'Golden Wire ' was firmly fixed, and their exertions were too ir regular. Muscular force failed, upon which they changed their tactics. At the suggestion of their ' Maula,' they prepared to burn incense in honour of the Shaykh Abu Zulaymah. The material not being forthcoming, they used coffee, which perhaps accounts for the shortcomings of that holy man. After this the Rais remembered that their previous exertions had not begun under the auspices of the Fatihah. Therefore they prayed, and then re applied themselves to work. Still they failed. Finally, each man called aloud upon his own particular saint or spiritual guide, and rushed forward as if he alone sufficed for the exploit. Shaykh Hamid unwisely quoted the name, and begged the assistance, of his great ancestor, the ' Clarified-Butter-Sellerthe obdurate 'Golden Wire' was not moved, and Hamid retired in momentary confusion.

This was generally voted a minor miracle, and ^ysical efforts the Effendi was respected—for a day or two. • stood ontti The wind was fair, but we had all to re-embark, an ill quavering operation which went on till noon.

[jghtei The only remains of any antiquity—except the wells—are wa iid£ the fortifications which the Portuguese erected to keep gthf out the Badawin. The little town lies upon a plain that jnsufff stretches with a gradual rise from the sea to the lofty { ore ca mountain-axis of the Sinaitic group. The country around jissati reminded me strongly of maritime Sind; a flat of clay 0 and sand, clothed with sparse turfs of Salsolae, and g eeC y bearing strong signs of a (geologically speaking) recent morn i; origin. The town is inhabited principally by Greek seaW j and other Christians, 1 who live by selling water and terror i provisions to ships. A fleecy cloud hung lightly over f or iiic the majestic head of Jabal Tur, about eventide, and ^hb; the outlines of the giant hills stood ' picked out ' from out; t( the clear blue sky. Our Rais, weather-wise man, warned us that these were indications of a gale, and that, in case ou j{ a : of rough weather, he did not intend to leave Tur. I was not sorry to hear this. We had passed a pleasant day, i n i oc . drinking sweet water, and eating the dates, grapes, and war( j. pomegranates, which the people of the place carry down g rouni to the beach for the benefit of hungry pilgrims. Besides 0 { twc which, there were various sights to see, and with these su ^ e] we might profitably spend the morrow. We therefore pitched the tent upon the sand, and busied ourselves with accom i Those people are descendants of Syrians and Greeks that Wlth(] fled from Candia, Scios, the Ionian Islands, and Palestine to escape guard: the persecutions of the Turks. They now wear the Arab dress, and { 0 SU j speak the language of the country, but they are easily to be distin- j guished from the Moslems by the expression of their countenances and sometimes by their blue eyes and light hair. There are also a few families calling themselves Jabaliyah, or mountaineers. Origin- ln Wll ally they were 100 households, sent by Justinian to serve the convent celebr of St. Catherine, and to defend it against the Berbers. Sultan Kansuh g X (g rr al-Ghori, called by European writers Campson Gaury, the Mamluk King of Egypt, in a.d. 1501, admitted these people into the Moslem community on condition of their continuing the menial service they had afforded to the monks.X.— The Pilgr 203 extricating a box of provisions: the labour was rendered lighter by the absence of the Maghrabis, some of whom were wandering about the beach, whilst others had gone off to fill their bags with fresh water. We found their surliness insufferable; even when we were passing from poop to forecastle, landing or boarding, they grumbled forth their dissatisfaction. Our Rais was not mistaken in his prediction. The fleecy cloud on Tur's tops had given true warning. When morning (9th July) broke, we found the wind strong, and the sea white with foam. Most of us thought lightly of these terrors, but our valorous captain swore that he dared not for his life cross in such a storm the mouth of ill-omened Akabah. We breakfasted, therefore, and afterwards set out to visit Moses' Hot Baths, mounted on wretched donkeys with pack-saddles, ignorant of stirrups, and with out tails, whilst we ourselves suffered generally from boils, which, as usual upon a journey, make their appearance in localities the most inconvenient. Our road lay north ward across the plain towards a long narrow strip of date ground, surrounded by a ruinous mud wall. After a ride of two or three miles, we entered the gardens, and came suddenly upon the Hammam. It is a prim little Cockney bungalow, built by Abbas Pasha of Egypt for his own accommodation; glaringly whitewashed, and garnished with diwans and calico curtains of a gorgeous hue. The guardian had been warned of our visit, and was present to supply us with bathing-cloths and other necessaries. One by one we entered the cistern, which is now in an inner room. The water is about four feet deep, warm in winter, cool in summer, of a saltish-bitter taste, but celebrated for its invigorating qualities, when applied externally. On one side of the calcareous rock, near the ground, is the hole opened for the spring by Moses' rod, which must have been like the ' mast of some tall204 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. Ammiral 1 '; and near it are the marks of Moses' nails- deep indentations in the stone, which were probably left there by some extinct Saurian. Our Cicerone informed us that formerly the finger-marks existed, and that they were long enough for a man to lie in. The same func tionary attributed the sanitary properties of the spring to the blessings of the Prophet, and, when asked why Moses had not made sweet water to flow, informed us that the Great Lawgiver had intended the spring for bathing in, not for drinking. We sat with him, eating the small yellow dates of Tur, which are delicious, melting like honey in the mouth, and leaving a surpassing After finishing sundry pipes and cups of coffee, we gave the bath-man a few piastres, and, mounting our donkeys, started eastward for the Bir Musa, 2 which we reached in half an hour. It is a fine old work, built round and domed over with roughly squared stones, very like what may be seen in some rustic parts of Southern England. The sides of the pit were so rugged that a man could climb down them, and at the bottom was a pool of water, sweet and abundant. We had intended to stay there, and to dine al fresco, but the hated faces of our companions, the Maghrabis, meeting us at the entrance, nipped that pro ject in the bud. Accordingly we retired from the burning 1 Adam's forehead (says the Tarikh Tabari) brushed the skies, but this height being inconvenient, the Lord abridged it to 100 cubits. The Moslems firmly believe in Anakim. Josephus informs us that Moses was of 'divine form and great tallness'; the Arabs specify his stature,—300 cubits. They have, moreover, found his grave in some parts of the country S.E, of the Dead Sea, and make cups of a kind of bitumen called ' Moses' Stones.' This people nescit ignorare —it will know everything. 2 ' Moses' Well.' I have no argument except the untrustworthy traditions of the Badawin, either for or against this having been the identical well near which Moses sat when he fled from the face of Pharaoh to the land of Midian. One thing is certain, namely, that in this part of Arabia, as also at Aden, the wells are of a very ancient dateX.— The 205 sun to a neighbouring coffee-house—a shed of palm leaves kept by a Tur man, and there, seated on mats, we demolished the contents of our basket. Whilst we were eating, some Badawin came in and joined us, when invited so to do. They were poorly dressed, and all sprinjt armed with knives and cheap sabres, hanging to leathern hyMost; bandoleers : in language and demeanour they showed that ft few remains of their old ferocity. As late as Mohammed Ali's time these people were noted wreckers, and formerly they were dreaded pirates: now they are lions with their fangs and claws drawn. In the even, when we returned to our tent, a Syrian, one of our party on the poop, came out to meet us with the information that several large vessels had arrived from Suez, comparatively speaking, empty, and that the cap tain of one of them would land us at Yambu' for three dollars a head. The proposal was tempting. But presently it became apparent that my companions were unwilling to shift their precious boxes, and moreover, that I should have to pay for those who could not or would not pay for themselves,—that is to say, for the whole party. As such a display of wealth would have teen unadvisable, I dismissed the idea with a sigh. Amongst the large vessels was one freighted with Persian pilgrims, a most disagreeable race of men on a journey or a voyage. They would not land at first, because they feared the Badawin. They would not take water from the town people, because some of these were Christians. More over, they insisted upon making their own call to prayer, which heretical proceeding—it admits five extra words— our party, orthodox Moslems, would rather have died than have permitted. When their crier, a small wizen- faced man, began the Azan with a voice ' in quel tenore Che fa il cappon quando talvolta canta,' we received it with a shout of derision, and some, hastily2o 5 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. snatching up their weapons, offered him an opportunity of martyrdom. The Maghrabis, too, hearing that the Persians were Rafaz (heretics) crowded fiercely round to do a little Jihad, or Fighting for the Faith. The long- bearded men took the alarm. They were twice the number of our small party, and therefore they had been in the habit of strutting about with nonchalance, and looking at us fixedly, and otherwise demeaning themselves in an indecorous way. But when it came to the point, they showed the white feather. These Persians accompanied us to the end of our voyage. As they approached the Holy Land, visions of the ' Nabbut' caused a change for the better in their manners. At Mahar they meekly endured a variety of insults, and at Yambu' they cringed to us like dogs.CHAPTER XL to yambu'. O n the nth July, 1853, about dawn, we left Tur, after a pleasant halt, with the unpleasant certainty of not touching ground for thirty-six hours. I passed the time in steadfast contemplation of the web of my umbrella, and in making the following meteorological remarks. Morning. —The air is mild and balmy as that of an Italian spring; thick mists roll down the valleys along the sea, and a haze like mother-o'-pearl crowns the head lands. The distant rocks show Titanic walls, lofty don jons, huge projecting bastions, and moats full of deep shade. At their base runs a sea of amethyst, and as earth receives the first touches of light, their summits, almost transparent, mingle with the jasper tints of the sky. Nothing can be more delicious than this hour. But as ' les plus belles choses Ont le pire destin,' so lovely Morning soon fades. The sun bursts up from behind the main, a fierce enemy, a foe that will force every one to crouch before him. He dyes the sky orange, and the sea ' incarnadine,' where its violet surface is stained by his rays, and he mercilessly puts to flight the mists and haze and the little agate-coloured masses of cloud that were before floating in the firmament. The atmosphere is so clear that now and then a planet is visible. For the two208 Pilgrimage to Al-Madin Meccah. hours following sunrise the rays are endurable; after that they become a fiery ordeal. The morning beams oppress you with a feeling of sickness; their steady glow, re flected by the glaring waters, blinds your eyes, blisters your skin, and parches your mouth : you now become a monomaniac; you do nothing but count the slow hours that must ' nfinute by ' before you can be relieved. 1 Midday.—The wind, reverberated by the glowing hills is like the blast of a lime-kiln. All colour melts away with the canescence from above. The sky is a dead milk-white, and the mirror-like sea so reflects the tint that you can scarcely distinguish the line of the horizon. After noon the wind sleeps upon the reeking shore; there is a deep stillness; the only sound heard is the melan choly flapping of the sail. Men are not so much sleeping as half-senseless; they feel as if a few more degrees of heat would be death. Sunset. —The enemy sinks behind the deep cerulean sea, under a canopy of gigantic rainbow which covers half the face of heaven. Nearest to the horizon is an arch of tawny orange ; above it another of the brightest gold, and based upon these a semi-circle of tender sea- green blends with a score of delicate gradations into the sapphire sky. Across the rainbow the sun throws its rays in the form of giant wheel-spokes tinged with a beautiful pink. The Eastern sky is mantled with a purple flush that picks out the forms of the hazy Desert and the sharp-cut Hills. Language is a thing too cold, too poor, to express the harmony and the majesty of this hour, which is as evanescent, however, as it is lovely. Night falls rapidly, when suddenly the appearance of the Zodiacal Light 2 re- 1 The reader who has travelled in the East will feel that I am not exaggerating. And to convince those who know it only by descrip tion, I will refer them to any account of our early campaigns in Sind, where many a European soldier has been taken up stone dead after sleeping an hour or two in the morning su^i. ^ 2 The Zodiacal Light on the Red Sea, and in Bombay, is farXI.— YamhiC. 209 stores the scene to what it was. Again the grey hills and the grim rocks become rosy or golden, the palms green, the sands saffron, and the sea wears a lilac surface of dimpling waves. But after a quarter of an hour all fades once more; the cliffs are naked and ghastly under the moon, whose light falling upon this wilderness of white crags and pinnacles is most strange—most 'mysterious. Night. —The horizon is all darkness, and the sea reflects the white visage of the night-sun as in a mirror of steel. In the air we see giant columns of pallid light, distinct, based upon the indigo-coloured waves, and standing with their heads lost in endless space. The stars glitter with exceeding brilliance. 1 At this hour are ' — river and hill and wood. With all the numberless goings on of life, Inaudible as dreams ' ; while the planets look down upon you with the faces of smiling friends. You feel the ' sweet influence of the Pleiades.'

And with one look at a certain little Star in the north, under which lies all that makes life worth living through—surely it is a venial superstition to sleep with your eyes towards that Kiblah!—you fall into oblivion. Those thirty-six hours were a trial even to the hard- headed Badawin. The Syrian and his two friends fell ill. Omar Effendi, it is true, had the courage to say his falls rapill brighter than in England.

On shore we saw a few wretched-looking beings, Juhaynah 1 or Hutaym, seated upon heaps of dried wood, which they sold to travellers; and three boat-loads of Syrian pilgrims who had preceded us. We often envied them their small swift craft, with their double latine sails disposed in ' hare-ears ' which, about eventide in the far distance, looked like a white gull alighting upon the purple wave; and they justified our jealousy by arriving at Yambu' two days before us. The pilgrims had bivouacked upon the beach, and were engaged in drinking their after- dinner coffee. They received us with all the rights of hospitality, as natives of Al-Madinah should everywhere be received ; we sat an hour with them, ate a little fruit, satisfied our thirst, smoked their pipes, and when taking leave blessed them. Then returning to the vessel we fed, and lost no time in falling asleep. The dawn of the next day saw our sail flapping in the idle air. And it was not without difficulty that in the course of the forenoon we entered Wijh Harbour, distant from Dumayghah but very few miles. Al-Wijh is also a natural anchorage, in no way differing from that where we passed the night, except in being smaller and shallower and less secure. From this place to Cairo the road is safe. The town is a collection of round huts meanly built of round stones, and clustering upon a piece of elevated rock on the northern side of the creek.

They extend from the plains north of Yambu' into the Sinaitic Peninsula. They boast no connection with the great tribe Al-Harb; but they are of noble race, are celebrated for fighting, and, it is said, have good horses. The specimens we saw at Marsa Dumayghah were poor ones, they had few clothes, and no arms except the usual Jambiyah (crooked dagger).

But when friends and acquaintances were hanging on to both heroes so firmly that they could not move hand or arm, their wrath, as usual, rose, till it was terrible to see. The little village resounded with the war, and many a sturdy knave rushed in, sword or cudgel in hand, so as not to lose the sport. During the heat of the fray, a pistol which was in Omar Effendi's hand went off—accidentally of course—and the ball passed so close to the tins containing the black and muddy Mocha, that it drew the attention of all parties. As if by magic, the storm was lulled. A friend recog nised Sa'ad the Demon, and swore that he was no black slave, but a soldier at Al-Madinah—' no waiter, but a Knight Templar.' This caused him to be looked upon as rather a distinguished man, and he proved his right to the honour by insisting that his late enemy should feed with him, and when the other decorously hung back, by drag ging him to dinner with loud cries. My alias that day was severely tried. Besides the Persian pilgrims, a number of nondescripts who came in the same vessel were hanging about the coffee-house; lying down, smoking, drinking water, bathing and pick ing their teeth with their daggers. One inquisitive manXL — 217 ^ ^eteet was always at my side. He called himself a Pathan ' as was; (Afghan settled in India); he could speak five or six 3 ^ e travellei languages, he knew a number of people everywhere, and Sa me IdiKj, he had travelled far and wide over Central Asia. These fel- iuch it was t: lows are always good detectors of an incognito. I avoided sacr 'fice(l 1)| answering his question about my native place, and after kd him telling him that I had no longer name or nation, being a ^ the caft Darwaysh, I asked him, when he insisted upon my having ' low-broweij, been born somewhere, to guess for himself. To my joy wiseunwillinj, he claimed me for a brother Pathan, and in course of ■rthies, after! conversation he declared himself to be the nephew of an 'ther's throafe Afghan merchant, a gallant old man who had been civil nd encourage, to me at Cairo. We then sat smoking together with acquaintance: ' effusion.' Becoming confidential, he complained that lat they coiil he, a Sunni, or orthodox Moslem, had been abused, mal- 4 rose, tilli treated, and beaten by his fellow-travellers, the heretical indedwiMi Persian pilgrims. I naturally offered to arm my party, to in, swoni ci take up our cudgels, and to revenge my compatriot. This During tk thoroughly Sulaymanian style of doing business could not mar Effendn fail to make him sure of his man. He declined, however, and the ba! wisely remembering that he had nearly a fortnight of the le black ail Persians' society still to endure.

About midday we passed by Shaykh Hasan al-Marabit's tomb. It is the usual domed and whitewashed building, surrounded by the hovels of its guardians, standing upon a low flat island of yellow rock, vividly reminding me of certain scenes in Sind. Its dreary position attracts to it the attention of passing travellers; the dead saint has a prayer and a Fatihah for the good of his soul, and the live sinner wends his way with religious refreshment. Near sunset the wind came on to blow freshly, and we cast anchor together with the Persian pilgrims upon a rock. This was one of the celebrated coral reefs of the Red Sea, and the sight justified Forskal's emphatic de scription— lux us lususcjuc iintuviT,, It was a huge ledge or platform rising but little above the level of the deep; the water-side was perpendicular as the wall of a fort; and, whilst a frigate might have floated within a yard of it, every ripple dashed over the reef, replenishing the little basins and hollows in the surface. The colour of the waves near it was a vivid amethyst. In the distance the eye rested upon what appeared to be meadows of brilliant flowers resembling those of earth, only far brighter and more lovely. Nor was this Land of the Sea wholly deso late. Gulls and terns here swam the tide; there, seated upon the coral, devoured their prey. In the air, troops of birds contended noisily for a dead flying fish, 1 and in the deep water they chased a shoal, which, in fright and hurry to escape the pursuers, veiled the surface with i These the Arabs, in the vulgar tongue, call Jarad al-Bahr, ' sea locusts'; as they term the shrimp Burghut al-Bahr, or the sea-flea. Such compound words, palpably derived from land objects, prove the present Ichthyophagi and the Badawin living on the coast to be a race originally from the interior. Pure and ancient Arabs still have at least one uncompounded word to express every object familiar to them, and it is in this point that the genius of the language chieny shows itself.XI.— ToYanthC. 219 spray and foam. And as night came on the scene shifted, displaying fresh beauties. Shadows clothed the back ground, whose features, dimly revealed, allowed full scope to the imagination. In the forepart of the picture lay the sea, shining under the rays of the moon with a metallic lustre; while its border, where the wavelets dashed upon the reef, was lit by what the Arabs call the 'jewels of the deep 1 '—brilliant flashes of phosphoric light giving an idea of splendour which Art would vainly strive to imitate. Altogether it was a bit of fairyland, a spot for nymphs and sea-gods to disport upon: you might have heard, without astonishment, old Proteus calling his flocks with the writhed conch; and Aphrodite seated in her shell would have been only a fit and proper climax for its love liness. But—as philosophically remarked by Sir Cauline the Knyghte— ' Every whyte must have its blacke. And every sweete its soure— ,, this charming coral reef was nearly being the scene of an ugly accident. The breeze from seaward set us slowly but steadily towards the reef, a fact of which we soon became conscious. Our anchor was not dragging; it had not rope enough to touch the bottom, and vainly we sought for more. In fact the 'Golden Wire' was as disgracefully deficient in all the appliances of safety, as any English merchantman in the nineteenth century,—a circumstance which accounts for the shipwrecks and for the terrible loss of life perpetually occurring about the Pil grimage-season in these seas. Had she struck upon the razor-like edges of the coral-reef, she would have melted 1 The Arab superstition is, that these flashes of light are jewels made to adorn the necks and hair of the mermaids and mermen. When removed from their native elements the gems fade and dis appear. If I remember right, there is some idea similar to this among the Scotch, and other Northern people.220 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccak. away like a sugar-plum in the ripple, for the tide was rising at the time. Having nothing better to do, we began to make as much noise as possible. Fortunately for us, the Rais commanding the Persian's boat was an Arab from Jeddah; and more than once we had treated him with great civility. Guessing the cause of our distress, he sent two sailors overboard with a cable ; they swam gallantly up to us; and in a few minutes we were safely moored to the stern of our useful neighbour. Which done, we applied ourselves to the grateful task of beating our Rais, and richly had he deserved it. Before noon, when the wind was shifting, he had not once given himself the trouble to wear; and when the breeze was falling, he preferred dosing to taking advantage of what little wind remained. With energy we might have been moored that night comfortably under the side of Hassani Island, instead of floating about on an unquiet sea with a lee- shore of coral-reef within a few yards of our counter. At dawn the next day (15th July) we started. We made Jabal Hassani 1 about noon, and an hour or so before sunset we glided into Marsa Mahar. Our rest ing-place resembled Marsa Dumayghah at an humble distance ; the sides of the cove, however, were bolder and more precipitous. The limestone rocks presented a peculiar appearance; in some parts the base and walls had crumbled away, leaving a coping to pro ject like a canopy ; in others the wind and rain had cut deep holes, and pierced the friable material with caverns that looked like the work of art. There was a pretty opening of backwood at the bottom of the 1 The word Jabal will frequently occur in these pages. It is applied by the Arabs to any rising ground or heap of rocks, and, therefore, must not always be translated ' Mountain.' In the latter sense, it has found its way into some of the Mediterranean dialects. Gibraltar is Jabal al-Tarik, and ' Mt. Ethne that men clepen Mounte Gy belle ' is ' Monte Gibello,'— the mountain, par excellence.XL—To YamhC. 221 cove; and palm trees in the blue distance gladdened our eyes, which pined for the sight of something green. The Rais, as usual, would have terrified us with a description of the Hutaym tribe that holds these parts, and I knew from Welsted and Moresby that it is a debased race. But forty-eight hours of cramps on board ship would make a man think lightly of a much more imminent danger. Wading to shore we cut our feet with the sharp rocks. I remember to have felt the acute pain of some thing running into my toe: but after looking at the place and extracting what appeared to be a bit of thorn, 1 I dis missed the subject, little guessing the trouble it was to give me. Having scaled the rocky side of the cove, we found some half-naked Arabs lying in the shade; they were unarmed, and had nothing about them except their villainous countenances wherewith to terrify the most timid. These men still live in limestone caves, like the Thamud tribe of tradition ; also they are Ichthyophagi, existing without any other subsistence but what the sea affords. They were unable to provide us with dates, flesh, or milk, but they sold us a kind of fish called in India ' Buibroiled upon the embers, it proved delicious. After we had eaten and drunk and smoked, we began to make merry; and the Persians, who, fearing to come on shore, had kept to their conveyance, appeared proper butts for the wit of some of our party: one of us stood up and pronounced the orthodox call to prayer, after which the rest joined in a polemical hymn, exalting the virtues i It was most probably a prickle of the ' egg-fruit,' or so common in these seas, generally supposed to be poisonous. I found it impossible to cure my foot in Al-Hijaz, and every remedy seemed to make it worse. This was as much the effect of the climate of Arabia, as of the hardships and privations of a pilgrimage. After my return to Egypt in the autumn, the wound healed readily with out medical treatment.222 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah Meccah. and dignity of the first three Caliphs. 1 Then, as general on such occasions, the matter was made personal by informing the Persians in a kind of rhyme sung by the Meccan gamins, that they were the ' slippers of Ali and the dogs of Omar.' But as they were too frightened to reply, my companions gathered up their cooking utensils, and returned to the ' Golden Wire,' melancholy, like disappointed candidates for the honours of Donnybrook. Our next day was silent and weary, for we were all surly, and heartily sick of being on board ship. We should have made Yambu' in the evening but for the laziness of the Rais. Having duly beaten him, we anchored on the open coast, insufficiently protected by a reef, and almost in sight of our destination. In the distance rose Jabal Radhwah or Radhwa, 2 one of the 'Mountains of Paradise 3 ' in which honoured Arabia abounds. It is celebrated by poetry as well as by piety. •' Did Radhwah strive to support my woes, Radhwah itself would be crushed by the weight/* says Antar. 4 It supplies Al-Madinah with hones. I heard much of its valleys and fruits and bubbling springs, but afterwards I learned to rank these tales with the super stitious legends which are attached to it. Gazing at its bare and ghastly heights, one of our party, whose wit was soured by the want of fresh bread, surlily remarked that such a heap of ugliness deserved ejection from heaven,—an irreverence too public to escape general denunciation. We waded on shore, cooked there, and 1 Abu Bakr, Omar, and Osman. 2 I have found both these forms of writing the word in books; Moresby, or rather Mr. Rassam, erroneously spells it ' Ridwah.' 3 In a future chapter, when describing a visit to Mt.

Sa'ad the Demon was especially vicious; his eyes gazed fixedly on the ground, his lips protruded till you might have held up his face by them, his mouth was gar nished with bad wrinkles, and he never opened it but he grumbled out a wicked word. He solaced himself that evening by crawling slowly on all-fours over the boy Mohammed, taking scrupulous care to place one knee upon the sleeper's face. The youth awoke in a fiery rage : we all roared with laughter; and the sulky Negro, after savouring the success of his spite, grimly, as but half satisfied, rolled himself, like a hedgehog, into a ball; and, resolving to be offensive even in his forgetfulness, snored violently all night. We slept upon the sands and arose before dawn (July 17), determined to make the Rais start in time that day. A slip of land separated us from our haven, but the wind was foul, and by reason of rocks and shoals, we had to make a considerable de It was about noon on the twelfth day after our departure from Suez, when, after slowly beating up the narrow creek leading to Yambu' harbour, we sprang into a shore-boat and felt new life when bidding an eternal adieu to the vile ' Golden Wire.' I might have escaped much of this hardship and suffering by hiring a vessel to myself. There would then have been a cabin to retire into at night, and shade from the sun; moreover, the voyage would have lasted five, not twelve, days. But I wished to witness the scenes on board a pilgrim ship,—scenes so much talked of by the Moslem palmer home-returned. Moreover, the hire was exorbitant, ranging from £4.0 to and it would have led to a greater expenditure, as the man who can afford to take a boat must pay in proportion during his land224 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah and journey. In these countries you perforce go on as you begin: to 'break one's expenditure,' that is to say, to retrench expenses, is considered all but impossible. We have now left the land of Egypt. ■011 as n ! 1° say,! ssible, | CHAPTER XII. the halt at yambu'. T he heat of the sun, the heavy dews, and the fre quent washings of the waves, had so affected my foot, that on landing at Yambu' I could scarcely place it upon the ground. But traveller's duty was to be done; so, leaning upon my 'slave's' shoulder, I started at once to see the town, whilst Shaykh Hamid and the others of our party proceeded to the custom-house. Yanbu'a al-Bahr, Yambu' or Fountain of the Sea, 1 identified, by Abyssinian Bruce, with the lambia village of Ptolemy, is a place of considerable importance, and shares with others the title of ' Gate of the Holy City.' It is the third quarter of the caravan road 2 from Cairo to Meccah; and here, as well as at Al-Badr, pilgrims fre quently leave behind them, in hired warehouses, goods too heavy to be transported in haste, or too valuable to risk in dangerous times. Yambu' being the port of Al- 1 Yanbu'a in Arabic is ' a Fountain.' Yanbu'a of the Sea is so called to distinguish it from ' Yanbu'a of the Palm-Grounds,' a village at the foot of the mountains, about 18 or 20 miles distant from the sea-port. Ali Bey places it one day's journey E. J N.E. from Yanbu'a al-Bahr, and describes it as a pleasant place in a fertile valley. It is now known as Yambu'a al-Nakhil. See 'The Land of Midian (Revisited).' 2 The first quarter of the Cairo caravan is Al-Akabah; the second is the Manhal Salmah (Salmah's place for watering camels); the third is Yambu'; and the fourth Meccah. vol. i. 15226 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Madinah, as Jeddah is of Meccah, is supported by a considerable transport trade and extensive imports from the harbours on the Western coasts of the Red Sea; it supplies its chief town with grain, dates, and henna. Here the Sultan's dominion is supposed to begin, whilst the authority of the Pasha of Egypt ceases; there is no Nizam, or Regular Army, however, in the town, 1 and the governor is a Sharif or Arab chief. I met him in the great bazar; he is a fine young man of light complexion and the usual high profile, handsomely dressed, with a Cashmere turband, armed to the extent of sword and dagger, and followed by two large, fierce-looking Negro slaves leaning upon enormous Nabbuts. The town itself is in no wise remarkable. Built on the edge of a sunburnt plain that extends between the mountains and the sea, it fronts the northern extremity of a narrow winding creek. Viewed from the harbour, it is a long line of buildings, whose painful whiteness is set off by a sky-like cobalt and a sea-like indigo ; behind it lies the flat, here of a bistre-brown, there of a lively tawny; whilst the background is formed by dismal Radh- wah, 'Barren and bare, unsightly, unadorned.' Outside the walls are a few little domes and tombs, which by no means merit attention. Inside, the streets are wide; and each habitation is placed at an unsociable distance from its neighbour, except near the port and the bazars, where ground is valuable. The houses are roughly built of limestone and coralline, and their walls full of fossils crumble like almond cake ; they have huge i The Nizam, as Europeans now know, is the regular Turkish infantry. In Al-Hijaz, these troops are not stationed in small towns like Yambu'. At such places a party of Irregular horse, for the pur pose of escorting travellers, is deemed sufficient. The Yambu' police seems to consist of the Sharif's sturdy negroes. In Ali Bey's time Yambu' belonged to the Sharif of Meccah, and was garrisoned by him.XII.— The Hal 227 hanging windows, and look mean after those in the Mos lem quarters of Cairo. There is a 'Suk,' or market- street of the usual form, a long narrow lane darkened by a covering of palm leaves, with little shops let into the walls of the houses on both sides. The cafes, which abound here, have already been described in the last chapter ; they are rendered dirty in the extreme by travel lers, and it is impossible to sit in them without a fan to drive away the flies. The custom-house fronts the land ing-place upon the harbour; it is managed by Turkish officials,—men dressed in Tarbushes, who repose the live long day upon the Diwans near the windows. In the case of us travellers they had a very simple way of doing business, charging each person of the party three piastres for each large box, but by no means troubling themselves to meddle with the contents. 1 Yambu' also boasts of a Hammam or hot bath, a mere date-leaf shed, tenanted by an old Turk, who, with his surly Albanian assistant, lives by 'cleaning' pilgrims and travellers. Some white washed Mosques and Minarets of exceedingly simple form, a Wakalah or two for the reception of merchants, and a saint's tomb, complete the list of public buildings. In one point Yambu' claims superiority most other towns in this part of Al-Hijaz. Those who can afford the luxury drink sweet rain-water, collected amongst the hills in tanks and cisterns, and brought on camel- back to the town. Two sources are especially praised, the Ayn al-Birkat and the Ayn Ali, which suffice to supply the whole population: the brackish water of the wells is confined to coarser purposes. Some of the old people here, as at Suez, are said to prefer the drink to which 1 This, as far as I could learn, is the only tax which the Sultan's government derives from the northern Hijaz ; the people declare it to be, as one might expect at this distance from the capital, liable to gross peculation. When the Wahhabis held Yambu', they assessed it, like all other places; for which reason their name is held in the liveliest abhorrence.228 Pilgrimage toAl-Madincih years of habit have accustomed them, and it is a standing joke that, arrived at Cairo, they salt the water of the Nile to make it palatable. The population of Yambu'—one of the most bigoted and quarrelsome races in Al-Hijaz—strikes the eye after arriving from Egypt, as decidedly a new feature. The Shaykh or gentleman is over-armed and over-dressed, as Fashion, the Tyrant of the Desert as well as of the Court, dictates to a person of his consequence. The civilised traveller from Al-Madinah sticks in his waist- shawl a loaded pistol, 1 garnished with crimson silk cord, but he partially conceals the butt-end under the flap of his jacket. The Irregular soldier struts down the street a small armoury of weapons: one look at the man's countenance suffices to tell you what he is. Here and there stalk grim Badawin, wild as their native wastes, and in all the dignity of pride and dirt; they also are armed to the teeth, and even the presence of the police man's quarterstaff 2 cannot keep their swords in their scabbards. What we should call the peaceful part of the population never leave the house without the ' Nabbut' over the right shoulder, and the larger, the longer, and the heavier the weapon is, the more gallantry does the bearer claim. The people of Yambu' practise the use of this implement diligently; they become expert in delivering 1 Civilians usually stick one pistol in the belt; soldiers and fight ing men two, or more, with all the necessary concomitants of pouches, turnscrews, and long iron ramrods, which, opening with a screw, dis close a long thin pair of pincers, wherewith fire is put upon the chibuk. 2 The weapons with which nations are to be managed form a curious consideration. The Englishman tamely endures a staff, which would make a Frenchman mad with anger; and a Frenchman respects a sabre, which would fill an Englishman's bosom with civilian spleen. You order the Egyptian to strip and be flogged ; he makes no objec tion to seeing his blood flow in this way ; but were a cutting weapon used, his friends would stop at nothing in their fury.XII.— The Hal 229 a head-blow so violent as to break through any guard, and with it they always decide their trivial quarrels. 1 The dress of the women differs but little from that of the Egyptians, except in the face veil, 2 which is generally white. There is an independent bearing about the Yambu' men, strange in the East; they are proud without inso lence, and they look manly without blustering. Their walk partakes somewhat of the nature of a swagger, owing, per haps, to the shape of the sandals, not a little assisted by the self-esteem of the wearer, but there is nothing offen sive in it: moreover, the population has a healthy appear ance, and, fresh from Egypt, I could not help noticing their freedom from ophthalmic disease. The children, too, appear vigorous, nor are they here kept in that state of filth to which fear of the Evil Eye devotes them in the Valley of the Nile. My companions found me in a coffee-house, where I had sat down to rest from the fatigue of halting on my wounded foot through the town. They had passed their boxes through the custom-house, and were now inquiring in all directions, 'Where's the Effendi ?' After sitting for half an hour, we rose to depart, when an old Arab merchant, whom I had met at Suez, politely insisted 1 In Arabia, generally, the wound is less considered by justice and revenge, than the instrument with which it was inflicted.

Who has not remarked this at a masquerade ball ?230 Pilgrimage toAl-MadinaJi Meccah. upon paying for my coffee, still a mark of attention in Arabia as it was whilome in France. We then went to a Wakalah, near the bazar, in which my companions had j secured an airy upper room on the terrace opposite the ! sea, and tolerably free from Yambu's plague, the flies. It had been tenanted by a party of travellers, who were introduced to me as Omar Effendi's brothers; he had by accident met them in the streets the day before their start for Constantinople, where they were travelling to receive the Ikram. 1 The family was, as I have said before, from Daghistan (Circassia), and the male mem bers still showed unequivocal signs of a northern origin, in light yellowish skins, grey eyes fringed with dark lashes, red lips, and a very scant beard. They were broad-shouldered, large-limbed men, distinguished only by a peculiar surliness of countenance; perhaps their expression was the result of their suspecting me; for I observed them narrowly watching every movement during Wuzu and prayers. This was a good oppor tunity for displaying the perfect of a True Believer; and my efforts were, I believe, successful, for afterwards they seemed to treat me as a mere stranger, from whom they could expect nothing, and who there fore was hardly worth their notice. On the afternoon of the day of our arrival we sent for a Mukhavvij? (hirer of conveyance) and began to treat for camels. One Amm Jamal, a respectable native of Al-Madinah who was on his way home, under took to be the spokesman; after a long palaver (for 1 A certain stipend allowed by the Sultan to citizens of the Hara- mayn (Meccah and Al-Madinah).

I told him to hold his tongue, and sharply reproved the boy Mohammed, upon whose manner the effect of finding himself suddenly in a fresh country had wrought a change for the worse. ' Why, ye were lions at Cairo; and here, at Yambu', you are cats—hens! 2 ' It was not long, however, before the youth's impudence returned upon him with increased violence. We sat through the afternoon in the little room on the terrace, whose reflected heat, together with the fiery winds from the Wilderness, seemed to incommode even my companions. After sunset we dined in the open air, a body of twenty: master, servants, children and strangers. All the procurable rugs and pillows had been seized to make a Diwan, and we squatted together round a large cauldron of boiled rice, containing square masses of mutton, the whole covered with clarified butter. Sa'ad the Demon was now in his glory. With what anecdotes the occasion supplied him !

I was astonished to see our Maghrabi fellow-passengers in the bazar at Yambu' cringing and bowing to us, more like courtiers than Badawin.

By the advice of Amm Jamal 3 I dressed as an Arab, in order to avoid paying the a capita tion tax 3 which, upon this road, the settled tribes extort from stranger travellers; and he warned me not to speak any language but Arabic, even to my 'slave,' in the vicinity of a village. I bought for my own convenience a Shugdtif or litter 4 for which I paid two dollars. It is a 1 The night prayer. 2 41 Amm M means literally a paternal uncle. In the Hijaz it is prefixed to the names of respectable men, who may also be addressed ' Ya Amm Jamal!' (O Uncle Jamal!) To say ' Ya Ammi 1' (O my Uncle !) is more familiar, and would generally be used by a superior addressing an inferior. 3 Jizyat properly means the capitation tax levied on Infidels; in this land of intense pride, the Badawin, and even the town-chiefs, apply the opprobrious term to blackmail extorted from travellers, even of their own creed. 4 The Shugduf of Al-Hijaz differs greatly from that used in Syria and other countries. It is composed of two corded cots 5 feet long, slung horizontally, about half-way down, and parallel with the camel's sides. These cots have short legs, and at the halt may be used as bedsteads; the two are connected together by loose ropes, at tached to the inner long sides of the framework, and these are thrown over the camel's packsaddle. Thick twigs inserted in the ends and the outer long sides of the framework, are bent over the top, bower-fashion, to support matting, carpets, and any other pro tection against the sun. There is an opening in this kind of wicker-work in front (towards the camel's head), through which you creep ; and a similar one behind creates a draught of wind. The Mahmil, en deshabille.234 Pilgrimage to Al-Mcidina vehicle appropriated to women and children, fathers of families, married men, ' Shelebis, 1 ' and generally to those who are too effeminate to ride. My reason for choosing a litter was that notes are more easily taken in it than on a dromedary's back; the excuse of lameness prevented it detracting from my manhood, and I was careful when entering any populous place to borrow or hire a saddled beast. Our party dined early that day, for the camels had been sitting at the gate since noon. We had the usual trouble in loading them: the owners of the animals voci ferating about the unconscionable weight, the owners of the goods swearing that a child could carry such weight, while the beasts, taking part with their proprietors, moaned piteously, roared, made vicious attempts to bite, and started up with an agility that threw the half-secured boxes or sacks headlong to the ground. About 3 p.m. all was ready — the camels formed into Indian file were placed standing in the streets. But, as usual with Oriental travellers, all the men dispersed about the town: we did not mount before it was late in the afternoon. I must now take the liberty of presenting to the reader an Arab Shaykh fully equipped for travelling. 2 Nothing can be more picturesque than the costume, and Outside, towards the camel's tail, are pockets containing gullehs, or earthenware bottles, of cooled water. Inside, attached to the wicker- work, are large provision pouches, similar to those used in old- fashioned travelling chariots. At the bottom are spread the two beds. The greatest disadvantage of the Shugduf is the difficulty of keeping balance. Two men ride in it, and their weights must be made to tally. Moreover, it is liable to be caught and torn by thorn trees, to be blown off in a gale of wind ; and its awkwardness causes the camel repeated falls, which are most likely to smash it. Yet it is not necessarily an uncomfortable machine. Those for sale in the bazar are, of course, worthless, being made of badly seasoned wood. But private litters are sometimes pleasant vehicles, with turned and painted framework, silk cordage, and valuable carpets. The often described 'Mahmil is nothing but a Syrian Shugduf, royally ornamented. 1 ' Exquisites.' 2 It is the same rule with the Arab, on the road as at home; the^ mm ih. n ' Others of Orally JQ ^ reason for % taken in Qf lameness and I was :o borrow or 1 camels had the usual inimals voci- he owners ol such weight, proprietors, mpts to bite, i half-secured \bout 3 p.m, Indian file is usual wi )ut the town fternoon, nting to tin r travelling. 1 costume, and lining guilds, n id to the wicker ;e used in oii id the two beds. cultyofkeepiB; )emadetotJi. ■ees,tobeblo*i )t necessarily ai r are, of coiw t private it® ited framewotl ^'Mahmil'' 5 as at bo® 6 ' - m ll IXII,— The Ha 235 it is with regret that we see it exchanged in the towns and more civilised parts for any other. The long locks or the shaven scalps are surmounted by a white cotton skull-cap, over which is a Kufiyah—a large square kerchief of silk and cotton mixed, and generally of a dull red colour with a bright yellow border, from which depend crimson silk twists ending in little tassels that reach the wearer's waist. Doubled into a triangle, and bound with an A akal 1 or fillet of rope, a skein of yarn or a twist of wool, the kerchief fits the head close behind: it pro jects over the forehead, shading the eyes, and giving a fierce look to the countenance. On certain occasions one end is brought round the lower part of the face, and is fastened behind the head. This veiling the features is technically called Lis am : the chiefs generally fight so, and it is the usual disguise when a man fears the avenger of blood, or a woman starts to take her In hot weather it is supposed to keep the Samun, in cold weather the catarrh, from the lungs. more he is dressed the greater is his respectability. For this reason, you see Sharifs and other men of high family, riding or walking in their warm camel's hair robes on the hottest days. Another super stition of the Arabs is this, that thick clothes avert the evil effects of the sun's beams, by keeping out heat. To the kindness of a friend —Thomas Seddon—I owe the admirable sketch of an 'Arab Shaykh in his Travelling Dress.'* 1 Shanfs and other great men sometimes bind a white turband or a Cashmere shawl round the kerchief, to keep it in its place. The Aakal varies in every part of the country. Here it is a twist of dyed wool, there a bit of common rope, three or four feet long. Some of the Arab tribes use a circlet of wood, com posed of little round pieces, the size of a shilling, joined side by side, and inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The Eastern Arabs wear a large circle of brown wool, almost a turband in itself. In Barbary, they twist bright- coloured cloth round a rope, and adorn it with thick golden thread. 2 Generally written ' Thar,' the blood-revenge right, acknow- ledged by law and custom. (See Chapter xxiv. post.)236 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah The body dress is simply a or cotton shirt: tight sleeved, opening in front, and adorned round the waist and collar, and down the breast, with embroidery like net-work; it extends from neck to foot. Some wear wide trousers, but the Badawin consider such things effeminate, and they have not yet fallen into the folly of socks and stockings. Over the Kamis is thrown a long- skirted and short-sleeved cloak of camel's hair, called an Aba. It is made in many patterns, and of all materials from pure silk to coarse sheep's wool; some prefer it brown, others white, others striped: in Al-Hijaz the favourite hue is white, embroidered with gold, 1 tinsel, or yellow thread in two large triangles, capped with broad bands and other figures running down the shoulders and sides of the back. It is lined inside the shoulders and breast with handsome stuffs of silk and cotton mixed, and is tied in front by elaborate strings, and tassels or acorns of silk and gold. A sash confines the Kamis at the waist, and supports the silver-hilted Jamhiyah^ or crooked dag ger : the picturesque Arab sandal 3 completes the costume. Finally, the 1 Gold, however, as well as silk, I may be excused for repeating, is a forbidden article of ornament to the Moslem. 2 The silver-hilted dagger is a sign of dignity: ' I would silver my dagger,' in idiomatic Hijazi, means, ' I would raise myself in the world.' 3 Niebuhr has accurately described this article. It is still worn in the Madras army, though long discarded from the other presi dencies ; the main difference between the Indian and the Arab sandal is, that the former has a ring, into which the big toe is inserted, and the latter a thong, which is clasped between the big toe and its neigh bour. Both of them are equally uncomfortable, and equally injurious to soldiers, whose legs fight as much as do their arms. They abrade the skin wherever the straps touch, expose the feet to the sun, wind, and rain, and admit thorns and flints to the toes and toe-nails. In Arabia, the traveller may wear, if he pleases, slippers, but they areXII.—The Halt 237 Shaykh's arms are a sword and a matchlock slung behind his back; in his right hand he carries a short javelin 1 or a light crooked stick, about two feet and a half long, called a Mas'hah? used for guiding camels. The poorer clans of Arabs twist round their waist, considered townsman-like and effeminate. They must be of the usual colours, red or yellow. Black shoes, though almost universally worn by the Turks at Cairo and Constantinople, would most probably excite suspicion in Al-Hijaz. 1 The Mizrak, as it is called, is peculiar to certain tribes, as the Karashi and the Lahyami, and some, like the Hudayli near Meccah, make very pretty as well as very useful darts. The head is 15 or 16 inches long, nowhere broader than an inch, and tapering gradually to a fine point; its shape is two shallow prisms joined at their bases, and its socket, round like that of all lances, measures a little less than 2 inches. The lower third of the blade only is adorned with bars, lozenges, and cones of brass let into the iron in zig-zag and other figures. The ^haft is of hard pliant wood—I do not know of what tree—well seasoned with grease and use; it is 23 inches long, and strengthened and adorned at distances of half an inch apart by bands of fine brass wire, about one inch and a half long. The heel of the weapon is a blunt spike 14 inches long, used to stick it in the ground, and this, as well as the lower third of the blade, is ornamented with brass work. Being well balanced, the Mizrak is a highly efficient weapon for throwing in hunting, and by its hand some appearance adds not a little to the bearer's dignity. But the stranger must be careful how he so arms himself. Unless he be undistinguishable from a Badawi, by carrying a weapon peculiar to certain clans, he will expose himself to suspicion, or to laughter. And to offend an Arab of Al-Hijaz mortally, you have only to say bluntly, ' Sell me thy spear.' The proper style of address to the man whose necessities compel him to break through one of his ' points d'honneur,' is to say, ' Give me that javelin, and I will satisfy thee;' after which he will haggle for each copper piece as though you were cheapening a sheep. 2 The Mas'hab is of almond, generally brought from Syria; at the thick end is a kind of crook, formed by cutting off a bit of the larger branch from which the stick grows. This crook is afterwards cut into the shape useful to seize a camel's nose-ring, or a horse's bridle. Arabs of all degrees are fond of carrying these sticks. [It is also called Maghin.]238 Pilgrimage to AUMadinah and Meccah. next to the skin, a long plait of greasy leather, to support the back; and they gird the shirt at the middle merely with a cord, or with a coarse sash. The dagger is stuck in this scarf, and a bandoleer slung over the shoulders carries the cartridge-case, powder-flask, flint and steel, priming-horn, and other necessaries. With the traveller, the waist is an elaborate affair. Next to the skin is worn the money-pouch, concealed by the Kamis; the latter is girt with a waist shawl, over which is strapped a leathern belt. 1 The latter article should always be well garnished with a pair of long-barrelled and silver- mounted flint pistols, 2 a large and a small dagger, and an 1 This article, the Silahlik of the Turks, is composed of several oblong pieces of leather cut out to fit the front part of the body; between each fold there is room enough to stick a weapon ; a substan tial strap fastens it round the waist, and it serves to defend the sash or the shirt from iron mould, and the stains of gunpowder. It is made of all kinds of material, from plain Morocco leather to the richest velvet embroidered with gold. 4 2 It is as well to have a good pair of Turkish barrels and stocks, fitted up with locks of European manufacture; those made by natives of these countries can never be depended upon. The same will apply to the gun or rifle. Upon the whole, it is more prudent to have flint locks. Copper caps are now sold in the bazars of Meccah and Al-Madinah, where a Colt's M six-shooter ' might excite attention for a day; but were the owner in a position to despise notoriety, he might display it everywhere without danger. One of our guards, who was killed on the road, had a double-barrelled English fowling-piece. Still, when doubts must not be aroused, the traveller will do well to avoid, even in the civilised Hijaz, suspicious appearances in his weapons. I carried in a secret pocket a small pistol with a spring dagger, upon which dependence could be placed, and I was careful never to show it, discharging it and loading it always in the dark. Some men wear a little dagger strapped round the leg, below the knee. Its use is this: when the enemy gets you under, he can prevent you bringing your hand up to the weapon in your waist-belt; but before he cuts your throat, you may slip your fingers down to the knee, and persuade him to stop by a stab in the perineum. This knee dagger is required only in very dangerous places. The article I chiefly accused myself of forgetting was aXII.— The Halt 239 iron ramrod with pincers inside; a little leathern pouch fastened to the waist-strap on the right side contains cartridge, wadding, and flask of priming powder. The sword hangs over the shoulder by crimson silk cords and huge tassels 1 : well-dressed men apply the same showy ornaments to their pistols. In the hand may be borne a bell-mouthed blunderbuss; or, better still, a long single-barrel gun with an ounce bore. All these weapons must shine like silver, if you wish to be respected; for the knightly care of arms is here a sign of manliness. Pilgrims, especially those from Turkey, carry, I have said, a ' Hamail,' to denote their holy errand. This is a pocket Koran, in a handsome gold-embroidered crim son velvet or red morocco case, slung by red silk cords over the left shoulder. It must hang down by the right side, and should never depend below the waist-belt. For this I substituted a most useful article. To all appearance a ' Hamail,' it had inside three compart ments ; one for my watch and compass, the second for ready money, and the third contained penknife, pencils, and slips of paper, which I could hold concealed in the hollow of my hand. These were for writing and drawing: opportunities of making a ' fair copy' into the diary- book, 2 are never wanting to the acute traveller. He stout English clasp-knife, with a large handle, a blade like an 'Arkansas toothpick,' and possessing the other useful appliances of picker, fleam, tweezers, lancet, and punch. 1 Called 'Habak': these cords are made in great quantities at Cairo, which possesses a special bazar for them, and are exported to all the neighbouring countries, where their price considerably in creases. A handsome pistol-cord, with its tassels, costs about 12 shillings in Egypt; at Meccah, or Al-Madinah, the same would fetch upwards of a pound sterling. 2 My diary-book was made up for me by a Cairene; it was a long thin volume fitting into a breast-pocket, where it could be carried without being seen. I began by writing notes in the Arabic character, but as no risk appeared, my journal was afterwards kept in English. More than once, by way of experiment, I showed the240 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. must, however, beware of sketching before the Badawin, who would certainly proceed to extreme measures, sus pecting him to be a spy or i sorcerer. 1 Nothing so effectually puzzles these people as the Frankish habit of put ting everything on paper; their imaginations are set at work, and then the worst may be expected from them. The only safe way of writing in presence of a Badawi would be when drawing out a horoscope or preparing a charm; he also objects not, if you can warm his heart upon the subject, to seeing you take notes in a book of genealogies. You might begin with, 'And you, men of Harb, on what origin do you pride yourselves ? ' And while the listeners became fluent upon the, to them, all-interesting writing on a loose slip of paper to my companions, and astonished them with the strange character derived from Solomon and Alex ander, the Lord of the Two Horns, which we Afghans still use. For a short trip a pencil suffices; on long journeys ink is necessary; the latter article should be English, not Eastern, which is washed out clean the first time your luggage is thoroughly soaked with rain. The traveller may use either the Persian or the brass Egyptian ink stand ; the latter, however, is preferable, being stronger and less likely to break. But, unless he be capable of writing and reading a letter correctly, it would be unadvisable to stick such an article in the waist-belt, as this gives out publicly that he is a scribe. When sketching, the pencil is the best, because the simplest and shortest mode of operation is required. Important lines should afterwards be marked with ink, as 'fixing' is impossible on such journeys. For prudence sake, when my sketches were made, I cut up the paper into square pieces, numbered them for future reference, and hid them in the tin canisters that contained my medicines. 1 An accident of this kind happened not long ago, in Hazramaut, to a German traveller who shall be nameless. He had the morti fication to see his sketch-book, the labour of months, summarily appropriated and destroyed by the Arabs. I was told by a Hazra maut man at Cairo, and by several at Aden, that the gentleman had at the time a narrow escape with his life; the Badawin wished to put him to death as a spy, sent by the Frank to ensorceler their country, but the Shaykhs forbade bloodshed, and merely deported the offender. Travellers caught sketching are not often treated with such forbearance.XII.— The Halt at 241 theme, you could put down whatever you please upon the margin. The townspeople are more liberal, and years ago the Holy Shrines have been drawn, surveyed and even lithographed, by Eastern artists: still, if you wish to avoid all suspicion, you must rarely be seen with pen or with pencil in hand. At 6 p.m., descending the stairs of our Wakalah,we found the camels standing loaded in the street, and shifting their ground in token of impatience. 1 My Shug- duf, perched upon the back of a tall strong animal, nodded and swayed about with his every motion, impressing me with the idea that the first step would throw it over the shoulders or the crupper. The camel-man told me I must climb up the animal's neck, and so creep into the vehicle. But my foot disabling me from such exertion, I insisted upon their bringing the beast to squat, which they did grumblingly. 2 We took leave of Omar Efifendi's brothers and their dependents, who insisted upon paying us the compliment of accompanying us to the gate. Then we mounted and started, which was a signal for all our party to disperse once more. Some heard the report of a vessel having arrived from Suez, with Mohammed Shiklibha and other friends on board; these hurried down to the harbour for a parting word. Others, declaring they had forgotten some necessaries for the way, ran off to spend one last hour in gossip at the coffee-house. Then the sun set, and prayers must be said. The brief twilight had almost faded away before all had mounted. With loud cries of ' Wassit, ya hu! 1 All Arabs assert that it pains the loaded camel's feet to stand still, and, certainly, the 'fidgettiness ' of the animal to start, looks as if he had some reason to prefer walking. 2 It often strains the camel to rise with a full Shugduf on his back, besides which the motion is certain to destroy the vehicle in a few days. Those who are unable to climb up the camel's neck usually carry with them a short ladder, vol i. l6 ^^ liwigiPWPijMu^Pilgrmage toAl-Mcidincih Go in the middle of the road, O He!' and 'Jannib, y'al Jammal 1 !—Keep to the side, O camel-man!' we threaded our way through long, dusty, narrow streets, flanked with white-washed habitations at considerable intervals, and large heaps of rubbish, sometimes higher than the houses. We were stopped at the gate to ascertain if we were strangers, in which case, the guard would have done his best to extract a few piastres before allowing our luggage to pass; but he soon perceived by my companions 4 accent, that they were Sons of the Holy City,—consequently, that the case was hopeless. While standing here, Shaykh Hamid vaunted the strong walls and turrets of Yambu', which he said were superior to those of Jeddah 2 : they kept Sa'ud, the Wahhabi, at bay in a.d. 1802, but would scarcely, i should say, resist a field battery in a.d. 1853. The moon rose fair and clear, dazzling us with light as we emerged from the shadowy streets; and when we launched into the Desert, the sweet air delightfully contrasted with the close offensive atmos phere of the town. My companions, as Arabs will do on such occasions, began to sing. 1 Wassit means, ' go in the middle of the road' 1 Jannib, ' keep clear of the sides.' These words are fair specimens of how much may be said by two Arabic syllables. Ya hu (O, he) is an address common in Arabia as in Egypt, and Y'al Jammal (O camel-man) is perhaps a little more civil. 2 The rivalry between the Sons of the two Holy Cities extends even to these parts ; the Madanis contending for Yambu', the Mac- cans for Jeddah.-man!' % ^ streets, considerable imes highei gate to !) the guard ^stres before •ercwedbj CHAPTER XIII. of the Hol| ;ss.

By the light of a glorious moon, nearly at the rabs will i full, I was able to see the country tolerably well. Our party consisted of twelve camels, and we trav elled in Indian file, head tied to tail, with but one out- sofhownil r ^ er ' Omar Effendi, whose rank required him to mount a is an addres dromedary with showy trappings.

I vociferated with indignation, and brought the thing home to his feelings, by asking him how he, an Arab, would like to be called an Egyptian, —a Fellah ? The rest of the party was behind, sitting or dozing upon the rough platforms made by the lids of the two huge boxes slung to the sides of their camels. Only one old woman, Al-Sitt Maryam (the lady Mary), return- 1 Alluding to the celebrated mountain, the ' Hindu-kush,' whence the Afghans sallied forth to lay waste India.244 Pilgrimage to Al -Madimh ing to Al-Madinah, her adopted country, after a visit to a sister at Cairo, allowed herself the luxury of a half-dollar Shibriyah or cot, fastened crosswise over the animal's load. Moreover, all the party, except Omar Effendi, in token of poverty, were dressed in the coarsest and dirtiest of clothes,—the general suit consisting of a shirt torn in divers places and a bit of rag wrapped round the head. They carried short chibuks without mouth-pieces, and tobacco-pouches of greasy leather. Though the country hereabouts is perfectly safe, all had their arms in readiness, and the unusual silence that succeeded to the singing,— even Sa'ad the Demon held his tongue,—was sufficient to show how much they feared for their property. After a slow march of two hours facing the moon, we turned somewhat towards the North-East, and began to pass over undulating ground, in which a steady rise was per ceptible. We arrived at the halting-place at three in the morning, after a short march of about eight hours, during which we could not have passed over more than sixteen miles. 1 The camels were nakh'd 2 ; the boxes were taken off and piled together as a precaution against invisible robbers; my little tent, the only one in the party, was pitched ; we then spread our rugs upon the ground and lay down to sleep. We arose at about 9 a.m. (July 19), and after congrat ulating one another upon being once more in the 'dear Desert,' we proceeded in exhilarated mood to light the fire for pipes and breakfast. The meal—a biscuit, a little rice, and a cup of milkless tea—was soon dis patched, after which I proceeded to inspect our position. 1 Throughout this work I have estimated the pace of a Hijazi camel, laden and walking in caravan line, under ordinary circum stances, at , two geographical miles an hour. A sandy plain or a rocky pass might make a difference of half a mile each way, but not more. 2 See Chap. VIII., page 152, note 1, ante.XIII.— From Yamhi' Biv 245 About a mile to the westward lay the little village Al-Musahhal, 1 a group of miserable mud hovels. On the south was a strip of bright blue sea, and all around, an iron plain producing naught but stones and grasshoppers, and bounded northward by a grisly wall of blackish rock. Here and there a shrub fit only for fuel, or a tuft of coarse grass, crisp with heat, met the eye. All was sun-parched; the furious heat from above was drying up the sap and juice of the land, as the simmering and quivering atmos phere showed; moreover the heavy dews of these regions, forming in large drops upon the plants and stones, con centrate the morning rays upon them like a system of burning-glasses. After making these few observations I followed the example of my companions, and returned to sleep. At two p.m . we were roused to a dinner as simple as the breakfast had been. Boiled rice with an abundance of the clarified butter 2 in which Easterns delight, some frag ments of Kahk 3 or soft biscuit, and stale bread 4 and a handful of stoned and pressed date-paste, called 'Ajwah, formed the mem. Our potations began before dinner with a vile-tasted but wholesome drink called Akit,® 1 The reader must be warned that these little villages in Arabia, as in Sind and Baluchistan, are continually changing their names, whilst the larger settlements always retain the same. The traveller, too, must beware of writing down the first answer he receives ; in one of our maps a village on the Euphrates is gravely named 'M'adri,' (' Don't know'). 2 Here called Samn, the Indian ghee. 3 The ' Kahk ' in this country is a light and pleasant bread made of ground wheat, kneaded with milk, leavened with sour bean flour, and finally baked in an oven, not, as usual, in the East, upon an iron plate. The Kahk of Egypt is a kind of cake. 4 -Stale unleavened bread is much relished by Easterns, who say that keeping it on journeys makes it sweet. To prevent its becoming mouldy, they cut it up into little bits, and, at the risk of hardening it to the consistence of wood, they dry it by exposure to the air. 5 This Akit has different names in all parts of Arabia; even in246 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. dried sour milk dissolved in water ; at the meal we drank the leather-flavoured element, and ended with a large cupful of scalding tea. Enormous quantities of liquid were consumed, for the sun seemed to have got into our throats, and the perspiration trickled as after a shower of rain. Whilst we were eating, a Badawi woman passed close by the tent, leading a flock of sheep and goats, seeing which I expressed a desire to drink milk. My com panions sent by one of the camel-men a bit of bread, and asked in exchange for a cupful of 'laban. 1 ' Thus I learned that the Arabs, even in this corrupt region, still adhere to the meaningless custom of their ancestors, who chose to make the term ' Labban 2 ' (milk-seller) an oppro- I brium and a disgrace. Possibly the origin of the preju- Al-Hijaz it is known by the name of Mazir, as well as 'Igt,' (the corruption of Akit). When very sour, it is called ' Saribah,' and when dried, without boiling, 'Jamidah.' The Arabs make it by evaporating the serous part of the milk; the remainder is then formed into cakes or lumps with the hand, and spread upon hair cloth to dry. They eat it with clarified butter, and drink it melted in water. It is considered a cooling and refreshing beverage, but boasts few attractions to the stranger. The Baluchis and wild tribes of Sindians call this preparation of milk ' Krut,' and make it in the same way as the Badawin do. 1 In Arabic and Hebrew, milk; the Maltese give the word a very different signification, and the Egyptians, like the Syrians, confine their use of it to sour milk or curds—calling sweet milk ' laban halib,' or simply ' halib.' 2 In a previous work (History of Sind), I have remarked that there exists some curious similarity in language and customs between the Arabs and the various races occupying the broad ranges of hills that separate India from Persia. Amongst these must be numbered the prejudice alluded to above. Thelamented Dr. Stocks, of Bombay, who travelled amongst and observed the Brahui and the Baluchi nomads in the Pashin valley, informed me that, though they will give milk in exchange for other commodities, yet they consider it a disgrace to make money by it. This, methinks, is too conven tional a point of honour to have sprung up spontaneously in two countries so distant, and apparently so unconnected.ah.

They would have resented this with asperity, had it proceeded from their own people, but the Turkish pilgrim—the char acter in which they knew me, despite my Arab dress is a privileged person. The outer man of these Fight- Sons was contemptible; small chocolate-coloured beings, stunted and thin, with mops of course bushy hair burned brown by the sun, straggling beards, vicious eyes, frown ing brows, screaming voices, and well-made, but atten uated, limbs. On their heads were Kufiyahs in the last stage of wear: a tattered shirt, indigo-dyed, and girt with a bit of common rope, composed their clothing; and their feet were protected from the stones by soles of thick leather, kept in place by narrow thongs tied to the ankle. Both were armed, one with a match lock, and a Shintiyan'* in a leathern scabbard, slung over the shoulder, the other with a Nabbut, and both showed at the waist the Arab's invariable companion, the (dagger). These ragged fellows, however, had their pride. They would eat with me, and not disdain, like certain self-styled Caballeros, to ask for more; but of work they would do none. No promise of 'Bakhshish,' potent as 1 •' Beni-Kalb,' (or Juhaynah, Chap. X.), would mean the 'Dogs'- Sons '—' Beni-Harb,' the ' Sons of Fight.' 2 The Shintiyan is the common sword-blade of the Badawin; in Western Arabia, it is called Majar (from the Magyars ?), and is said to be of German manufacture. Good old weapons of the proper curve, marked like Andrew Ferraras with a certain number of lines down their length, will fetch, even in Arabia, from /y to The modern and cheap ones cost about 10s. Excellent weapons abound in this country, the reason being that there is a perpetual demand for them, and when once purchased, they become heir-looms in the family.

All the camel-men brandished their huge staves, and rushed back vociferating in the direction of the robbers. They were followed by the horsemen; and truly, had the thieves possessed the usual acuteness of the profession, they might have driven off the camels in our van with safety and convenience. 1 But these con temptible beings were only half a dozen in number, and they had lighted their matchlocks, which drew a bullet or two in their direction. Whereupon they ran away. This incident aroused no inconsiderable excitement, for it seemed ominous of worse things about to happen to us when entangled in the hills, and the faces of my com panions, perfect barometers of fair and foul tidings, fell to zero. For nine hours we journeyed through a bril liant moonlight, and as the first grey streak appeared in the Eastern sky we entered a scanty 'Misyal, 2 ' or Fiumara, strewed with pebbles and rounded stones, about half a mile in breadth, and flanked by almost perpen dicular hills of primitive formation. I began by asking the names of peaks and other remarkable spots, when I found that a folio volume would not contain a three months' collection 3 : every hill and dale, flat, valley, and 1 The way of carrying off a camel in this country is to loosen him, and then to hang on heavily to his tail, which causes him to start at full gallop. 2 The Arabic Misyal, Masyal, Masil, or Masilah, is the Indian Nullah and the Sicilian 'Fiumara,' a hill water-course, which rolls a torrent during and after rain, and is either partially or wholly dry at other seasons,—the stream flowing slowly underground. In England we want the feature, and therefore there is no single word to express it. Our ' River' is an imperfect way of conveying the idea. 3 Generalisation is not the forte of the Arabic language. ' Al- Kulzum ' (the Red Sea), for instance, will be unintelligible to the native of Jeddah; call it the Sea of Jeddah, and you at once explain yourself; so the Badawin will have names for each separate part, but no single one to express the whole. This might be explained by their ignorance of anything but details. The same thing is observable, however, in the writings of the Arabian geographers when they come to treat of the objects near home.XIII.—From YamhC Biv 251 water-course here has its proper name or rather names. The ingenuity shown by the Badawin in distinguishing between localities the most similar, is the result of a high organization of the perceptive faculties, perfected by the practice of observing a recurrence of landscape features few in number and varying but little amongst themselves. After travelling two hours up this torrent bed, winding in an Easterly direction, and crossing some 'Harrah,' or ridges of rock, steep descents, 1 ' Kitaah,' patch of stony flat, and bits of ' Sahil,' dwarf plain, we found ourselves about eight a.m ., after a march of about thirty-four miles, at Bir Sa'id (Sa'id's Well), our destination. „ I had been led to expect at the ' Well,' a pastoral scene, wild flowers, flocks and flowing waters; so I looked with a jaundiced eye upon a deep hole full of slightly brackish water dug in a tamped hollow—a kind of punch bowl with granite walls, upon whose grim surface a few thorns of exceeding hardihood braved the sun for a season. Not a house was in sight—it was as barren and desolate a spot as the sun ever 'viewed in his wide career.' But this is what the Arabian traveller must expect. He is to traverse, for instance, the Wady Al-Ward—the Vale of Flowers. He indulges in sweet recollections of Indian lakes beautiful with the Lotus, and Persian plains upon which Narcissus is the meanest of grasses. He sees a plain like swish-work, where knobs of granite act daisies; and where, at every fifty yards, some hapless bud or blossom is dying of inanition among the stones. The sun scorched our feet as we planted the tent, and, after drinking our breakfast, we passed the usual day of perspiration and semi-lethargy. In discomfort man natur- 1 About the classic ' Harrah,' I shall have more to say at a future iime. The word ' Ria ' in literary and in vulgar Arabic is almost synonymous with Alsabah, a steep descent, a path between hills or a mountain road.252 Pilgrimage toAl-Madimh ally hails a change, even though it be one from bad to worse. When our enemy began slanting towards the West, we felt ready enough to proceed on our journey. The camels were laden shortly after 3 p.m., July 20th, and we started, with water jars in our hands, through a storm of Samun. We travelled five hours in a North-Easterly course up a diagonal valley, 1 through a country fantastic in its deso lation—a mass of huge hills, barren plains, and desert vales. Even the sturdy Acacias here failed, and in some places the camel grass could not find earth enough for its root. The road wound among mountains, rocks and hills of granite, and over broken ground, flanked by huge blocks and boulders piled up as if man's art had aided Nature to disfigure herself. Vast clefts seamed like scars the hideous face of earth; here they widened into dark caves, there they were choked with glistening drift sand. Not a bird or a beast was to be seen or heard; their presence would have argued the vicinity of water; and, though my companions opined that Badawin were lurking among the rocks, I decided that these Badawin were the creatures of their fears. Above, a sky like polished blue steel, with a tremendous blaze of yellow light, glared upon us without the thinnest veil of mist cloud. Below, the brass-coloured circle scorched the face and dazzled the eyes, mocking them the while with offers of water that was but air. The distant prospect was more attractive than the near view, because it borrowed a bright azure tinge from the intervening atmosphere; but the jagged peaks and the perpendicular streaks of shadow down the flanks of the mountainous background i Valleys may be divided into three kinds, i. Longitudinal, i .e. parallel to the axis of their ridges; 2. Transversal or perpendicular to the same; and, 3. Diagonal, which form an acute or an obtuse angle with the main chain of mountains.XIII.—From Yavtbu' 253 showed that yet in store for us was no change for the better. Between 10 and 11 p.m., we reached human habita tions—a phenomenon unseen since we left Al-Musahhal— in the shape of a long straggling village. It is called Al-Hamra, from the redness of the sands near which it is built, or Al-Wasitah, the 'half-way,' because it is the middle station between Yambu' and Al-Madinah. It is therefore considerably out of place in Burckhardt's map ; and those who copy from him make it much nearer the sea-port than it really is. We wandered nearly an hour in search of an encamping station, for the surly villa gers ordered us off every flatter bit of ground, without, however, deigning to show us where our jaded beasts might rest. At last, after long wrangling, we found the usual spot; the camels were unloaded, the boxes and baggage were disposed in a circle for greater security against the petty pilferers in which this part of the road abounds, and my companions spread their rugs so as to sleep upon their valuables. I was invited to follow the general example; but I absolutely declined the vicinity of so many steaming and snoring fellow-travellers. Some wonder was excited by the Afghan Haji's obstinacy and recklessness; but re sistance to these people is sometimes and a man from Kabul is allowed to say and to do strange things. In answer to their warnings of nightly peril, I placed a drawn sword by my side 1 and a cocked pistol under my pillow, the saddle-bag : a carpet spread upon the cool loose sand formed by no means an uncomfortable couch, and upon it I enjoyed a sound sleep till day-break. Rising at dawn (July 21), I proceeded to visit the vil lage. It is built upon a narrow shelf at the top of a pre cipitous hill to the North, and on the South runs a sandy 1 This act, by the bye, I afterwards learned to be a greater act of imprudence than the sleeping alone. Nothing renders the Arab thief so active as the chance of stealing a good weapon.254 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah.. Fiumara about half a mile broad. On all sides are rocks and mountains rough and stony; so you find yourself in another of those punch-bowls which the Arabs seem to consider choice sites for settlements. 1 The Fiumara, hereabouts very winding, threads the high grounds all the way down from the plateau of Al-Madinah: during the rainy season it becomes a raging torrent, carrying west wards to the Red Sea the drainage of a hundred hills. Water of good quality is readily found in it by digging a few feet below the surface at the angles where the stream forms the deepest hollows, and in some places the stony sides give out bubbling springs. 2 Al-Hamra itself is a collection of stunted houses or rather hovels, made of unbaked brick and mud, roofed over with palm leaves, and pierced with air-holes, which occasionally boast a bit of plank for a shutter. It appears thickly populated in the parts where the walls are stand ing, but, like all settlements in the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, 8 it abounds in ruins. It is well supplied with provisions, which are here cheaper than at Al-Madinah,—a circumstance that induced Sa'ad the Demon to overload his hapless camel with a sack of wheat. In the village are a few shops where grain, huge plantains, ready-made bread, rice, 1 Probably, because water is usually found in such places. In the wild parts of the country, wells are generally protected by some fortified building, for men consider themselves safe from an enemy until their supply of water is cut off. 2 Near Al-Hamra, at the base of the Southern hills, within fire of the forts, there is a fine spring of sweet water. All such fountains are much prized by the people, who call them ' Rock-water,' and attribute to them tonic and digestive virtues. 3 As far as I could discover, the reason of the ruinous state of the country at present is the effect of the old Wahhabi and Egyptian wars in the early part of the present century, and the misrule of the Turks. In Arabia the depopulation of a village or a district is not to be remedied, as in other countries, by an influx of strangers; the land still belongs to the survivors of the tribe, and trespass would be visited with a bloody revenge.XIII.— FromYamhC to 255 i^rocksanj clarified butter, and other edibles are to be purchased. ;elfin ano| er Palm orchards of considerable extent supply it with dates. 11 tocoasida The bazar is, like the generality of such places in the ^ hereabouts villages of Eastern Arabia, a long lane, here covered with a '' the 'is; matting, there open to the sun, and the narrow streets— during tlu if they may be so called—are full of dust and glare. arr ying%t.

But that sheep proved a ' bone of contention.' The boy Mohammed had, in a fit of economy, sold its head to a Badawi for three piastres, and the others, dis appointed in their anticipations of 'haggis,' lost temper. With the 'Demon's' voluble tongue and impudent countenance in the van, they opened such a volley oi raillery and sarcasm upon the young 'tripe-seller,' that he in his turn became excited—furious. I had some difficulty to keep the peace, for it did not suit my interests that they should quarrel. But to do the Arabs justice, nothing is easier for a man who knows them than to work upon their good feelings. 'He is a stranger in your country—a guest!' acted as a charm; they listened patiently to Mohammed's gross abuse, only promising to answer him when in land, that is to say, near Meccah. But what especially soured our day was the report that Sa'ad, the great robber-chief, and his brother were in the field; consequently that our march would be delayed for some time : every half-hour some fresh tattle from the camp or the coffee-house added fuel to the fire of our impatience. A few particulars about this Schinderhans of Al- Hijaz 2 may not be unacceptable. He is the chief of the Sumaydah and the Mahamid, two influential sub-families of the Hamidah, the principal family of the Beni-Harb tribe of Badawin. He therefore aspired to rule all the Hamidah, and through them the Beni-Harb, in which case he would have been, de monarch of the Holy Land. But the Sharif of Meccah, and Ahmad Pasha, 1 To ' halal' is to kill an animal according to Moslem rites: a word is wanted to express the act, and we cannot do better than to borrow it from the people to whom the practice belongs. 2 He is now dead, and has been succeeded by a son worse than himself?XIII.—From Yambu Bir 257 the Turkish governor of the chief city, for some politi cal reason degraded him, and raised up a rival in the person of Shaykh Fahd, another ruffian of a similar stamp, who calls himself chief of the Beni-Amr, the third sub-family of the Hamidah family. Hence all kinds of confusion. Sa'ad's people, who number it is said 5000, resent, with Arab asperity, the insult offered to their chief, and beat Fahd's, who do not amount to 800. Fahd, supported by the government, cuts off Sa'ad's supplies. Both are equally wild and reckless, and—no where doth the glorious goddess, Liberty, show a more brazen face than in this Eastern ' Inviolate land of the brave and the free both seize the opportunity of shooting troopers, of plundering travellers, and of closing the roads. This state of things continued till I left the Hijaz, when the Sharif of Meccah proposed, it was said, to take the field in person against the arch-robber. And, as will after wards be seen in these pages, Sa'ad, had the audacity to turn back the Sultan's Mahmil or litter—the ensign of Imperial power—and to shut the road against its because the Pashas of Al-Madinah and of the Damascus caravan would not guarantee his restitution to his former dignity. That such vermin is allowed to exist proves the imbecility of the Turkish government. The Sultan pays pensions in corn and cloth to the very chiefs who arm their varlets against him ; and the Pashas, after purloin ing all they can, hand over to their enemies the means of resistance. It is more than probable, that Abd al-Majid has never heard a word of truth concerning Al-Hijaz, and that fulsome courtiers persuade him that men there tremble at his name. His government, however, is desirous, if report speaks truth, of thrusting Al-Hijaz upon the Egyptian, who on his side would willingly pay a large sum to avert such calamity. The Holy Land drains off Turkish gold and blood in abundance, and the VOL. I.258 Pilgrimage to Al-Madina lords of the country hold in it a contemptible position. If they catch a thief, they dare not hang him. They must pay black-mail, and yet be shot at in every pass. They affect superiority over the Arabs, hate them, and are despised by them. Such in Al-Hijaz are the effects of the charter of Gulkhanah, a panacea, like Holloway's Pills, for all the evils to which Turkish, Arab, Syrian, Greek, Egyptian, Persian, Armenian, Kurd, and Al banian flesh is heir to. Such the results of the Tanzimat, the silliest copy of Europe's folly—bureaucracy and centralisation—that the pen of empirical statecraft ever traced. 1 Under a strong-handed and strong-hearted despotism, like Mohammed All's, Al-Hijaz, in one genera tion, might be purged of its pests. By a proper use of the blood feud; by vigorously supporting the weaker against the stronger classes; by regularly defeating every Badawi who earns a name for himself; and, above all, by the exercise of unsparing, unflinching justice, 2 the few thousands of half-naked bandits, who now make the land a fighting field, would soon sink into utter insignifi- 1 The greatest of all its errors was that of appointing to the provinces, instead of the single Pasha of the olden time, three different governors, civil, military, and fiscal, all depending upon the supreme council at Constantinople. Thus each province has three plunderers instead of one, and its affairs are referred to a body that can take no interest in it. 2 Ziyad bin Abihi was sent by Al-Mu'awiyah, the Caliph, to reform Al-Basrah, a den of thieves ; he made a speech, noticed that he meant to rule with the sword, and advised all offenders to leave the city. The inhabitants were forbidden under pain of death to appear in the streets after evening prayers, and dispositions were made to secure the execution of the penalty. Two hundred persons were put to death by the patrol during the first night, only five during the second, and not a drop of blood was shed afterwards. By similar severity, the French put an end to assassination at Naples, and the Austrians at Leghorn. We may deplore the necessity of having recourse to such means, but it is a silly practice to salve the wound which requires the knife.XIII.—From YamhC Bir 259 cance. But to effect such end, the Turks require the old stratocracy, which, bloody as it was, worked with far less misery than the charter and the new code. What Milton calls •' The solid rule of civil government has done wonders for the race that nurtured and brought to perfection an idea spontaneous to their organisation. The world has yet to learn that the admirable exotic will thrive amongst the country gentlemen of Monomo- tapa or the ragged nobility of Al-Hijaz. 1 And it requires no prophetic eye to foresee the day when the Wahhabis or the Badawin, rising en masse, will rid the land of its feeble conquerors. 2 Sa'ad, the Old Man of the Mountains, was described to me as a little brown Badawi; contemptible in appear ance, but remarkable for courage and ready wit. He has for treachery a keen scent, which he requires to keep in exercise. A blood feud with Abd al-Muttalib, the present Sharif of Meccah, who slew his nephew, and the hostility of several Sultans, has rendered his life eventful. He lost all his teeth by poison, which would have killed him, had he not, after swallowing the potion, corrected it by drinking off a large pot- full of clarified butter. Since that time he has lived entirely upon fruits, which he gathers for himself, and 1 These remarks were written in 1853: I see no reason to change them in 1878. 2 A weak monarch, a degenerate government, a state whose cor ruption is evidenced by moral decay, a revenue bolstered up by a system of treasury paper, which even the public offices discount at from three to six per cent., an army accustomed to be beaten, and dis organised provinces; these, together with the proceedings of a ruth less and advancing enemy, form the points of comparison between the Constantinople of the present day and the Byzantine metropolis eight hundred years ago. Fate has marked upon the Ottoman Empire in Europe 'dehnda est': we are now witnessing the efforts of human energy and ingenuity to avert or to evade the fiat.260 Pilgrimage to Al-Madina coffee which he prepares with his own hands. In Sultan Mahmud's time he received from Constantinople a gorgeous purse, which he was told to open, as it con tained something for his private inspection. Suspect ing treachery, he gave it for this purpose to a slave, bidding him carry it to some distance; the bearer was shot by a pistol cunningly fixed, like Rob Roy's, in the folds of the bag. Whether this far-known story be 'true or only well found,' it is certain that Shaykh Sa'ad now fears the Turks, even 'when they bring gifts.' The Sultan sends, or is supposed to send him, presents of fine horses, robes of honour, and a large quantity of grain. But the Shaykh, trusting to his hills rather than to steeds, sells them ; he gives away the dresses to his slaves, and he distributes the grain amongst his clansmen. Of his character, men, as usual, tell two tales: some praise his charity, and call him the friend of the poor, as certainly as he is a foe to the rich. Others, on the contrary, describe him as cruel, cold-blooded, and notably, even among Arabs, revengeful and avaricious. The truth probably lies between these two extremes, but I observed that those of my companions who spoke most highly of the robber chief when at a distance seemed to be in the whilst under the shadow of his hills. Al-Hamra is the third station from Al-Madinah in the Darb Sultani, the 'Sultan's' or ' High Road,' the Westerly line leading to Meccah along the sea-coast. When the robbers permit, the pilgrims prefer this route on account of its superior climate, the facility of pro curing water and supplies, the vicinity of the sea, and the circumstance of its passing through 'Badr,' the scene of the Prophet's principal military exploits (a.h. 2). After mid-day, on the 21st July, when we had made up our minds that Fate had determined we should halt at Al- Hamra, a caravan arrived from Meccah; and the new travellers had interest to procure an escort, and permissionXIII.—From Yamhi' Bir 261 to proceed without delay towards Al-Madinah. The good news filled us with joy. A little after four p.m. we urged our panting camels over the fiery sands to join the Meccans, who were standing ready for the march, on the other side of the torrent bed. An hour afterwards we started in an Easterly direction. My companions having found friends and relations in theMeccan caravan,—the boy Mohammed's elder brother, about whom more anon, was of the number,—were full of news and excitement. At sunset they prayed with unction : even Sa'ad and Hamid had not the face to sit their camels during the halt, when all around were washing, sanding themselves, 1 and busy with their devo tions. We then ate our suppers, remounted, and started once more. Shortly after night set in, we came to a sudden halt. A dozen different reports rose to account for this circumstance, which was occasioned by a band of Badawin, who had manned a gorge, and sent forward a ' parliamentary,' ordering us forthwith to stop. They at first demanded money to let us pass; but at last, hearing that we were Sons of the Holy Cities, they granted us transit on the sole condition that the military,—whom they, like Irish peasants, hate and fear,—should return to whence they came. Upon this, our escort, 200 men, wheeled their horses round and galloped back to their barracks. We moved onwards, without, however, seeing any robbers; my camel-man pointed out their haunts, and showed me a small bird hovering over a place where he supposed water trickled from the rock. The fellow had attempted a sneer at my expense when the fray was impending. ' Why don't you load your pistols, Effendi,' i When water cannot be obtained for ablution before prayers, Moslems clap the palms of their hands upon the sand, and draw them down the face and both fore-arms. This operation, which is per formed once or twice—it varies in different schools—is called Tayammum. iMMWUIWll mm'262 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah he cried, 11 and get out of your litter, and show fight ? 'Because,' I replied as loudly, 'in my country, when dogs run at us, we thrash them with sticks.' This stopped Mansur's mouth for a time, but he and I were never friends. Like the lowest orders of Orientals, he required to be ill-treated ; gentleness and condescension he seemed to consider a proof of cowardice or of imbe cility. I began with kindness, but was soon compelled to use hard words at first, and then threats, which, though he heard them with frowns and mutterings, produced manifest symptoms of improvement. 'Oignez vilain, il vous poindra! Poignez vilain, il vous oindra!' says the old French proverb, and the axiom is more valuable in the East even than in the West. Our night's journey had no other incident. We travelled over rising ground with the moon full in our faces; and, about midnight, we passed through another long straggling line of villages, called Jadaydah, 1 or Al-Khayf. 3 The principal part of it lies on the left of the road going to Al-Madinah; it has a fort like that of Al-Hamra, springs of tolerable drinking water, a Nakhil or date- ground, and a celebrated (dead) saint, Abd al-Rahim al- Burai. A little beyond it lies the Bughaz 8 or defile, where in a.d. 1811 Tussun Bey and his 8000 Turks were totally defeated by 25,000 Harbi Badawin and Wahhabis. 4 1 I write this word as my companions pronounced it. Burck- hardt similarly gives it 'Djedeyde,' and Aii Bey ''Djideida.' Giovanni Finati wrongly calls the place 41 Jedeed Bughaz,' which Mr. Bankes, his editor, rightly translates the 11 new opening or pass.' 2 Al-Khayf is a common name for places in this part of Arabia. The word literally means a declivity or a place built upon a declivity. 3 Bughaz means in Turkish the fauces, the throat, and signifies also here a gorge, or a mountain pass. It is the word now commonly used in Al-Hijaz for the classical 'Nakb,' or ''Mazik.' Vincent (Periplus) errs in deriving the word from the Italian ''Bocca.' 4 Giovanni Finati, who was present at this hard-fought fieldXIII.—From YamhC Biv 263 This is a famous attacking-point of the Beni-Harb. In former timesboth Jazzar Pasha, the celebrated ' butcher' of Syria, and Abdullah Pasha of Damascus, were baffled at the gorge of Jadaydah 1 ; and this year the commander of the Syrian caravan, afraid of risking an attack at a place so ill-omened, avoided it by marching upon Meccah via the Desert road of Nijd. At four a.m ., having travelled about twenty-four miles due East, we encamped at Bir Abbas. as a soldier in Tussun's army, gives a lively description of the disas trous 'day of Jadaydah' in vol. i. of his work. 1 This Abdullah, Pasha of Damascus, led the caravan in a.d. 1756.

During the next season the Harb were paralysed by the blow, but in the third year they levied 80,000 men, attacked the caravan, pillaged it, and slew every Turk that fell into their hands.CHAPTER XIV. from bir abbas to al-madinah. The 22nd July was a grand trial of temper to our little party. The position of Bir Abbas exactly resembles that of Al-Hamra, except that the bulge of the hill-girt Fiumara is at this place about two miles wide. There are the usual stone-forts and palm- leaved hovels for the troopers, stationed here to hold the place and to escort travellers, with a coffee-shed, and a hut or two, called a bazar, but no village. Our encamping ground was a bed of loose sand, with which the violent Samum filled the air; not a tree or a bush was in sight; a species of hardy locust and swarms of flies were the only remnants of animal life: the scene was a caricature of Sind. Although we were now some hundred feet, to judge by the water-shed, above the level of the sea, the mid-day sun scorched even through the tent; our frail tenement was more than once blown down, and the heat of the sand made the work of repitching it painful. Again my companions, after breakfasting, hurried to the coffee-house, and returned one after the other with dispiriting reports. Then they either quar relled desperately about nothing, or they threw them selves on their rugs, pretending to sleep in very sulkiness. The lady Maryam soundly rated her surly son for refusing to fill her chibuk for the twelfth time that morning, with the usual religious phrases, 'Allah direct thee into the right way, O my son! '—meaning that he was going to the bad,—and 'O my calamity, thy mother is a lone woman, O Allah!'—equivalent to theXIV.— From Biv Abb 265 European parental plaint about grey hairs being brought down in sorrow to the grave. Before noon a small caravan which followed us came in with two dead bodies, —a trooper shot by the Badawin, and an Albanian killed by sun-stroke, or the fiery wind. 1 Shortly after mid-day a Caravan, travelling in an opposite direction, passed by us; it was composed chiefly of Indian pilgrims, habited in correct costume, and hurrying towards Meccah in hot haste. They had been allowed to pass unmolested, because probably a pound sterling could not have been collected from a hundred pockets, and Sa'ad the Robber sometimes does a cheap good deed. But our party, i The natives of Al-Hijaz assured me that in their Allah-favoured land, the Samum never kills a man. I 41 doubt the fact.' This Arnaut's body was swollen and decomposing rapidly, the true diagnostic of death by the poison-wind. (See Ibn Batuta's voyage, •* Kabul.') However, as troopers drink hard, the Arabs may still be right, the Samum doing half the work, arrack the rest. I travelled during the months of July, August, and September, and yet never found myself inconvenienced by the ^ poison-wind ' sufficiently to make me tie my Kufiyah, Badawi-fashion, across my mouth. At the same time I can believe that to an invalid it would be trying, and that a man almost worn out by hunger and fatigue would receive from it a coup degrdce, Niebuhr attributes the extraordinary mortality of his companions, amongst other causes, to a want of stimulants. Though these might doubtless be useful in the cold weather, or in the mountains of Al-Yaman, for men habituated to them from early youth, yet nothing, I believe, would be more fatal than strong drink when travelling through the Desert in summer heat. The common beverage should be water or lemonade; the strongest stimulants coffee or tea. It is what the natives of the country do, and doubt less it is wise to take their example. The Duke of Wellington's dictum about the healthiness of India to an abstemious man does not require to be quoted. Were it more generally followed, we should have less of sun-stroke and sudden death in our Indian armies, when soldiers, fed with beef and brandy, are called out to face the violent heat. At the same time it must be remembered, that foul and stag nant water, abounding in organic matter, is the cause of half the diarrhoea and dysentry which prove so fatal to travellers in these regions. To the water-drinker, therefore, a pocket-filter is indis pensable.256 Pilgrimage toAl-M adinali Meccah. having valuables with them, did not seem to gather heart from this event. In the evening we all went out to see some Arab Shaykhs who were travelling to Bir Abbas in order to receive their salaries. Without such it is popularly said and believed, no stone walls could enable a Turk to hold Al-Hijaz against the hill-men. Such was our system in Afghanistan—most unwise, teaching in limine the subject to despise rulers subject to blackmail. Besides which, these highly paid Shaykhs do no good. When a fight takes place or a road is shut, they profess inability to restrain their clansmen; and the richer they are, of course the more formidable they become. The party looked well; they were Harb, dignified old men in the picturesque Arab costume, with erect forms, fierce thin features, and white beards, well armed, and mounted upon high-bred and handsomely equipped dromedaries from Al-Shark. 1 Preceded by their half-naked clansmen, carrying spears twelve or thirteen feet long, garnished with single or double tufts of black ostrich feathers, and ponderous matchlocks, which were discharged on approaching the fort, they were not without a kind of barbaric pomp. Immediately after the reception of these Shaykhs, , there was a parade of the Arnaut Irregular horse. About 500 of them rode out to the sound of the or little kettle-drum, whose puny notes strikingly contrasted with this really martial sight. The men, it is true, were mounted on lean Arab and Egyptian nags, ragged- looking as their clothes; and each trooper was armed i Al-Shark, 'the East,' is the popular name in the Hijaz for the Western region as far as Baghdad andBassorah, especially Nijd. The latter province supplies the Holy Land with its choicest horses and camels. The great heats of the parts near the Red Sea appear pre judicial to animal generation; whereas the lofty table-lands and the broad pastures of Nijd, combined with the attention paid by the people to purity of blood, have rendered it the greatest breeding country in Arabia.XIV.—Fi'oiu Biv A I-Madincili, 267 in his own way, though all had swords, pistols and matchlocks, or firelocks of some kind. But they rode ^ hard as Galway 'buckeens,' and there was a gallant reckless look about the fellows which prepossessed me strongly in their favour. Their animals, too, though notable 'screws,' were well trained, and their accoutre ments were intended for use, not show. I watched their manceuvres with curiosity. They left their cantonments one by one, and, at the sound of the tom-tom, by degrees formed a 'plump' or ' herse '— it could not be called—all huddled together in confusion. Presently the little kettle-drum changed its note and the parade its aspect. All the serried body dispersed as would Light Infantry, now continuing their advance, then hanging back, then making a rush, and all the time keeping up a hot fire upon the enemy. At another signal they suddenly put their horses to full speed, and, closing upon the centre, again advanced in a dense mass. After three-quarters of an hour parading, sometimes charging singly, often in bodies, to the right, to the left, and straight in front, halt ing when requisite, and occasionally retreating^ Parthian- like, the Arnauts turned towards their lines. As they neared them, all broke off and galloped in, ventre a terre, discharging their shotted guns with much recklessness against objects assumed to denote the enemy. But ball-cartridge seemed to be plentiful hereabouts; during the whole of this and the next day, I remarked ragged that bullets, notched for noise, were fired away in mere fun. a 1 I mean a civilised column. 'Herse' is the old military name for a column opposed to ' Haye,' a line. So we read that at far-famed Cressy the French fought en ba the English drawn up en herse. This appears to have been the national predilection of that day. In later times, we and our neighbours changed style, the French preferring heavy columns, the English extending themselves into lines. 2 The Albanians, delighting in the noise of musketry, notch the ball in order to make it sing the louder. When fighting, they often268 Pilgrimage to Al -Madinah Barbarous as these movements may appear to the Cavalry Martinet of the ' good old school,' yet to some thing of the kind will the tactics of that arm of the service, j I humbly opine, return, when the perfect use of the rifle, the revolver, and field artillery shall have made the present necessarily slow system fatal. Also, if we adopt the common sense opinion of a modern writer, 1 and determine that 'individual prowess, skill in single com bats, good horsemanship, and sharp swords render cavalry formidable,' these semi-barbarians are wiser in their generation than the civilised, who never practise arms (properly so called), whose riding-drill never made a good rider, whose horses are over-weighted, and whose swords are worthless. They have yet another point of superiority over us; they cultivate the individuality of the soldier, whilst we strive to make him a mere automaton. In the days of European chivalry, battles were a system of well-fought duels. This was succeeded by the age of discipline, when, to use the language of Rabelais, ' men seemed rather a consort of organ-pipes, or mutual concord of the wheels of a clock, than an infantry and cavalry, or army of soldiers.' Our aim should now be to combine the merits of both systems ; to make men individually adopt the excellent plan—excellent, when rifles are not procurable— of driving a long iron nail through the bullet, and fixing its head into the cartridge. Thus the cartridge is strengthened, the bullet is rifled, and the wound which it inflicts is death. Round balls are apt to pass into and out of savages without killing them, and many an Afghan, after being shot or run through the body, has mortally I wounded his English adversary before falling. It is false philan thropy, also, to suppose that in battle, especially when a campaign is commencing, it is sufficient to maim, not to kill, the enemy. Nothing encourages men to fight so much, as a good chance of escaping with a wound—especially a flesh wound. I venture to hope that the reader will not charge these sentiments with cruelty. He who ren ders warfare fatal to all engaged in it will be the greatest benefactor the world has yet known. i The late Captain Nolan. /XIV.—From BivAbhas Al-Madimh. 269 excellent in the use of weapons, and still train them to act naturally and habitually in concert. The French have given a model to Europe in the Chasseurs de Vincennes,—a body capable of most perfect combination, yet never more truly excellent than when each man is fighting alone. We, I suppose, shall imitate them at some future time. 1 A distant dropping of fire-arms ushered in the evening of our first melancholy day at Bir Abbas. This, said my companions, was a sign that the troops and the hill-men were fighting. They communicated the intelligence, as if it ought to be an effectual check upon my impatience to proceed; it acted, however, in the contrary way. I supposed that the Badawin, after battling out the night, would be less warlike the next day; the others, however, by no means agreed in opinion with me. At Yambu' the whole party had boasted loudly that the people of Al-Madinah could keep their Badawin in order, and had twitted the boy Mohammed with their superiority in this respect to his townsmen, the Meccans. But now that a trial was impending, I saw none of the fearlessness so conspicuous when peril was only pos sible. The change was charitably to be explained by the presence of their valuables; the ' Sahharahs,' like conscience, making cowards of them all. But the young Meccan, who, having sent on his box by sea from Yambu ' i~The first symptom of improvement will be a general training to the Bayonet exercise. The British is, and for years has been, the only army in Europe that does not learn the use of this weapon; how long does it intend to be the sole authority on the side of ignor ance? We laughed at the Calabrese levies, who in the French war threw away their muskets and drew their stilettos ; and we cannot understand why the Indian would always prefer a sabre to a rifle. Yet we read without disgust of our men being compelled, by want of proper training, to 44 club their muskets*' in hand-to-hand fights, when they have in the bayonet the most formidable of offensive weapons,—and of the Kafirs and other savages wresting the piece, after drawing off its fire, from its unhappy possessor's grasp.270 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah to Jeddah, felt merry, like the empty traveller, would not lose the opportunity to pay off old scores. He taunted the Madinites till they stamped and raved with fury. At last, fearing some violence, and feeling answerable for the boy's safety to his family, I seized him by the nape of his neck and the upper posterior portion of his nether garments, and drove him before me into the tent. When the hubbub had subsided, and all sat after sup per smoking the pipe of peace in the cool night air, I re joined my companions, and found them talking, as usual, about old Shaykh Sa'ad. The scene was appropriate for the subject. In the distance rose the blue peak said to be his eyrie, and the place was pointed out with fearful mean ing. As it is inaccessible to strangers, report has con verted it into another garden of Iram. A glance, how ever, at its position and formation satisfied me that the bubbling springs, the deep forests, and the orchards of apple-trees, quinces and pomegranates, with which my companions furnished it, were a ' myth,' whilst some experience of Arab ignorance of the art of defence suggested to me strong doubts about the existence of an impregnable fortress on the hill-top. The mountains, however, looked beautiful in the moonlight, and distance gave them a semblance of mystery well suited to the themes which they inspired. That night I slept within my Shugduf, for it would have been mere madness to sleep on the open plain in a place so infested by banditti. The being armed is but a poor precaution near this robbers' den. If you wound a man in the very act of plundering, an exorbitant sum must be paid for blood-money. If you kill him, even to save your life, then adieu to any chance of escaping destruction. Roused three or four times during the night by jackals and dogs prowling about our little camp, I observed that my companions, who had agreed amongst themselves to keep watch by turns, had allXIV. — FromBir A bias Al-Madinah. 271 Would not fallen into a sound sleep. However, when we awoke in the morning, the usual inspection of goods and chattels showed that nothing was gone. The next day (July 23rd) was a forced halt, a sore stimulant to the traveller's ill-humour; and the sun, the sand, the dust, the furious Samum, and the want of certain small supplies, aggravated our grievance. My sore foot had been inflamed by a dressing of onion skin which the ladyMaryam had insisted upon applying to it. 1 Still being resolved to push forward by any conveyance that could be procured, I offered ten dollars for a fresh dromedary to take me on to Al-Madinah. Shaykh Hamid also declared he would leave his box in charge of a friend and accom pany me. Sa'ad the Demon flew into a passion at the idea of any member of the party escaping the general evil; and he privily threatened Mohammed to cut off the legs of any camel that ventured into camp. This, the boy—who, like a boy of the world as he was, never lost an opportunity of making mischief—instantly communi cated to me, and it brought on a furious dispute. Sa'ad was reproved and apologised for by the rest of the party; and presently he himself was pacified, principally, I believe, by the intelligence that no camel was to be hired at Bir Abbas. One of the Arnaut garrison, who had obtained leave to go to Al-Madinah, came to ask us if we could mount him, as otherwise he should be obliged to walk the whole way. With him we debated the propriety of attempting a passage through the hills by one of the many by-paths that traverse them: the project was amply discussed, and duly rejected. We passed the day in the usual manner; all crowded 1 I began to treat it hydropathically with a cooling bandage, but my companions declared that the water was poisoning the wound, and truly it seemed to get worse every day. This idea is prevalent throughout Al-Hijaz ; even the Badawin, after once washing a cut or a sore, never allow air or water to touch it.272 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. together for shelter under the tent. Even Maryam joined us, loudly informing Ali, her son, that his mother was no longer a woman but a man; whilst our party generally, 1 cowering away from the fierce glances of the sun, were either eating or occasionally smoking, or were occupied ' in cooling and drinking water. About sunset-time came a report that we were to start that night. None could believe that such good was in store for us; before sleeping, however, we placed each camel's pack apart, so as to be ready for loading at a moment's notice; and we took care to watch that our Badawin did not drive their animals away to any distance. At last, about 11 p.m., as the moon was beginning to peep over the Eastern wall of rock, was heard the glad sound of the little kettle-drum calling the Albanian troopers to mount and march. In the shortest possible time all made ready; and, hurriedly crossing the 1 sandy flat, we found ourselves in company with three or four Caravans, forming one large body for better defence against the dreaded Hawamid. 1 By dint of much manoeuvring, arms in hand,—Shaykh Hamid and the ' Demon ' took the prominent parts,—we, though the last comers, managed to secure places about the middle of the line. On such occasions all push forward reck lessly, as an English mob in the strife of sight-seeing; the rear, being left unguarded, is the place of danger, and none seeks the honour of occupying it. We travelled that night up the Fiumara in an Easterly direction, and at early dawn (July 24th) found ourselves in an ill-famed gorge called Shuab al-Hajj, 2 the ' Pilgrimage Pass.' The loudest talkers became silent as we neared it, and their countenances showed apprehension written in legible characters. Presently from the high precipi- 1 Hawamid is the plural of Hamidah, Shaykh Sa'ad's tribe. 2 Shuab properly means a path through mountains, or a water course between hills. It is generally used in Arabia for a ' Valley,' and sometimes instead of Nakb, or the Turkish Bughaz, a ' Pass.'cam XIV,—From Bir Ab Al-Madinah. 273 tous cliff on our left, thin blue curls of smoke—somehow or other they caught every eye—rose in the air ; and in stantly afterwards rang the sharp cracks of the hill- men's matchlocks, echoed by the rocks on the right. My Shugduf had been broken by the camel's falling during the night, so I called out to Mansur that we had better splice the framework with a bit of rope: he looked up, saw me laughing, and with an ejaculation of disgust dis appeared. A number of Badawin were to be seen swarming like hornets over the crests of the hills, boys as well as men carrying huge weapons, and climbing with the agility of cats. They took up comfortable places on the cut-throat eminence, and began firing upon us with perfect convenience to themselves. The height of the hills and the glare of the rising sun prevented my seeing objects very distinctly, but my companions pointed out to me places where the rock had been scarped, and where a kind of rough stone breastwork—theSangah of Afghanistan—had been piled up as a defence, and a rest for the long barrel of the matchlock. It was useless to challenge the Badawin to come down and fight us like men upon the plain ; they will do this on the Eastern coast of Arabia, but rarely, if ever, in Al-Hijaz. And it was equally unprofitable for our escort to fire upon a foe en sconced behind stones. Besides which, had a robber been killed, the whole country would have risen to a man; with a force of 3,000 or 4,000, they might have gained courage to overpower a Caravan, and in such a case not a soul would have escaped. As it was, the Badawin directed their fire principally against the Albanians. Some of these called for assistance to the party of Shaykhs that accompanied us from Bir Abbas; but the dignified old men, dismounting and squatting in council round their pipes, came to the conclusion that, as the robbers would probably turn a deaf ear to their words, they had better spare themselves the trouble of speaking. VOL. I. jg274 Pilgrimage to Al-Madimh Meccah. We had therefore nothing to do but to blaze away as much powder, and to veil ourselves in as much smoke, as possible; the result of the affair was that we lost twelve men, besides camels and other beasts of burden. Though the bandits showed no symptoms of bravery, and confined themselves to slaughtering the enemy from their hill-top, my companions seemed to consider this question able affair a most gallant exploit. After another hour's hurried ride through the Wady Sayyalah, appeared Shuhada, to which we pushed on, 'Like nighted swain on lonely road. When close behind fierce goblins tread.' Shuhada is a place which derives its name, 'The Martyrs,' because here are supposed to be buried forty braves that fell in one of Mohammed's many skirmishes. Some authorities consider it the cemetery of the people of Wady Sayyalah. 1 The once populous valley is now barren, and one might easily pass by the consecrated spot without observing a few ruined walls and a cluster of rude Badawin graves, each an oval of rough stones lying beneath the thorn trees on the left of and a little off the road. Another half hour took us to a favourite halting- place, Bir al-Hindi, 2 so called from some forgotten Indian 1 Others attribute these graves to the Beni Salim, or Salmah, an extinct race of Hijazi Badawin. Near Shuhada is Jabal Warkan, one of the mountains of Paradise, also called Irk al-Zabyat, or Thread of the Winding Torrent. The Prophet named it ' Hamt,' (sultriness), when he passed through it on his way to the Battle of Badr. He also called the valley ' Sajasaj,' (plural of Sajsaj, a temper ate situation), declared it was a valley of heaven, that 70 prophets had prayed there before himself, that Moses with 70,000 Israelites had traversed it on his way to Meccah, and that, before the Resur rection day, Isa bin Maryam should pass through it with the inten tion of performing the Greater and the Lesser Pilgrimages. Such are the past and such the future honours of the place. 2 The Indians sink wells in Arabia for the same reason which impels them to dig tanks at home,—' nam ke waste,'—' for the pur pose of name'; thereby denoting, together with a laudable desireXIV.—From Bir Abb Al-Madinah, 275 who dug a well there. But we left it behind, wishing to put as much space as we could between our tents and the nests of the Hamidah. Then quitting the Fiumara, we struck Northwards into a well-trodden road running over stony rising ground. The heat became sickening; here, and in the East generally, at no time is the sun more dan gerous than between eight and nine a.m . Still we hurried on. It was not before eleven a.m . that we reached our destination, a rugged plain covered with stones, coarse gravel, and thorn trees in abundance ; and surrounded by inhospitable rocks, pinnacle-shaped, of granite below, and in the upper parts fine limestone. The well was at least two miles distant, and not a hovel was in sight; a few Badawi children belonging to an outcast tribe fed their starveling goats upon the hills. This place is called 'Suwaykah'; it is, I was told, that celebrated in the history of the Arabs. 1 Yet not for this reason did my com rades look lovingly upon its horrors : their boxes were safe and with the eye of imagination they could now behold their homes. That night we must have travelled about twenty-two miles ; the direction of the road was due East, and the only remarkable feature in the ground was its steady rise. for posthumous fame, a notable lack of ingenuity in securing it. For it generally happens that before the third generation has fallen, the well and the tank have either lost their original names, or have exchanged them for others newer and better known. 1 Suwaykah derives its name from the circumstance that in the second, or third, year of the Hijrah (Hegira), Mohammed here attacked Abu Sufiyan, who was out on a foray with 200 men. The Infidels, in their headlong fight, lightened their beasts by emptying their bags of 'Sawik.' This is the old and modern Arabic name for a dish of green grain, toasted, pounded, mixed with dates or sugar, and eaten on journeys when it is found difficult to cook. Such is the present signification of the word: M. C. de Perceval (vol. hi., p. 84) gives it a different and a now unknown meaning. And our popular authors erroneously call the aftair the ' War of the Meal- sacks.'Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah We pitched the tent under a villainous Mimosa, the tree whose shade is compared by poetic Badawin to the false friend who deserts you in your utmost need. I enlivened the hot dull day by a final affair with Sa'ad the Demon. His alacrity at Yambu' ob tained for him the loan of a couple of dollars: he had bought grain at Al-Hamra, and now we were near Al-Madinah: still there was not a word about repayment. And knowing that an Oriental debtor discharges his debt as he pays his rent,—namely, with the greatest unwillingness,—and that, on the other hand, an Oriental creditor will devote the labour of a year to recovering a sixpence, I resolved to act as a native of the country, placed in my position, would; and by dint of sheer dunning and demanding pledges, to recover my property. About noon Sa'ad the Demon, after a furious rush, bare-headed, through the burning sun, flung the two dollars down upon my carpet : however, he presently recovered temper, and, as subsequent events showed, I had chosen the right part. Had he not been forced to repay his debt, he would have despised me as a 'freshman, and would have coveted more. As it was, the boy Mohammed bore the brunt of unpopular feeling, my want of liberality being traced to his secret and perfidious admonitions. He sup ported his burden the more philosophically, because, as he | notably calculated, every dollar saved at Al-Madinah would be spent under his stewardship at Meccah. At four p.m. (July 24th) we left Suwaykah, all of us in the crossest of humours, and travelled in a N.E. direction. So . 'out of temper ' were my companions, that at sunset, of the whole party, Omar Effendi was the only one who would eat 1 supper. The rest sat upon the ground, pouting, grumbling, and — they had been allowed to exhaust my stock of Latakia—smoking Syrian tobacco as if it were a grievance. Such a game at naughty children, I have seldom seen played even by Oriental men. The boy MohammedXIV.— FrontBir Abbas 277 privily remarked to me that the camel-men's beards were now in his fist,—meaning that we were out of their kins men, the Harb's, reach. He soon found an opportunity to quarrel with them ; and, because one of his questions was not answered in the shortest possible time, he pro ceeded to abuse them in language which sent their hands flying in the direction of their swords. Despite, however, this threatening demeanour, the youth, knowing that he now could safely go to any lengths, continued his ill words, and Mansur's face was so comically furious, that I felt too much amused to interfere. At last the camel-men dis appeared, thereby punishing us most effectually for our sport. The road lay up rocky hill and down stony vale ; a tripping and stumbling dromedary had been substituted for the usual monture: the consequence was that we had either a totter or a tumble once per mile during the whole of that long night. In vain the now fiery Mohammed called for the assistance of the camel-men with the full force of his lungs: ' Where be those owls, those oxen of the oxen, those beggars, those cut-off ones, those foreigners, those Sons of Flight 1 ? withered be their hands! palsied be their fingers! the foul mustachioed fellows, basest of the Arabs that ever hammered tent-peg, sneaking cats, goats of Al- Akhfash I 2 Truly I will torture them the torture of the oil, 3 the mines of infamy! the cold of countenance! 4 ' The Badawi brotherhood of the camel-men looked at him wickedly, muttering the while,—' By Allah ! and by Allah ! 1 A popular but not a bad pun—'* //arb ' (Fight), becomes, by the alteration of the H, 'Harb ' (Flight). 2 The old Arabic proverb is ' A greater wiseacre than the goat of Akhfash' ; it is seldom intelligible to the vulgar. 3 That is to say, ' I will burn them (metaphorically) as the fiery wick consumes the oil,'—a most idiomatic Hijazi threat. 4 A ' cold-of-countenance ' is a fool. Arabs use the word ' cold ' in a peculiar way. 'May Allah refrigerate thy countenance!' may it show misery and want. 'By Allah, a cold speech !' that is to say, a silly or an abusive tirade.278 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and by Allah! O boy, we will flog thee like a hound when we catch thee in the Desert!' All our party called upon him to desist, but his temper had got completely the upper hand over his discretion, and he expressed himself in such classic and idiomatic Hijazi, that I had not the heart to stop him. Some days after our arrival at Al-Madinah, Shaykh Hamid warned him seriously never again to go such perilous lengths, as the Beni Harb were celebrated for shooting or poniarding the man who ventured to use to them even the mild epithet 'O jackass!' And in the quiet of the city the boy Mohammed, like a sobered man shuddering at dangers braved when drunk, hearkened with discomposure and penitence to his friend's words. The only immediate consequence of his abuse was that my broken Shugduf became a mere ruin, and we passed the dark hours perched like two birds upon the only entire bits of framework the cots contained. The sun had nearly risen (July 25th) before I shook off the lethargic effects of such a night. All around me were hurrying their camels, regardless of rough ground, and not a soul spoke a word to his neighbour. ' Are there robbers in sight ?' was the natural question. ' No !' replied Mohammed ; ' they are walking with their eyes, 1 they will ■ presently see their homes!' Rapidly we passed the Wady al-Akik, 2 of which, ' O my friend, this is Akik, then stand by it. Endeavouring to be distracted by love, if not really a lover,' 3 1 That is to say, they would use, if necessary, the dearest and noblest parts of their bodies (their eyes) to do the duty of the basest • (i .e. their feet). 2 Writers mention two Al-Akik. The superior comprises the 1 v/hole site of Al-Madinah, extending from the Western Ridge, men tioned below, to the cemetery Al-Bakia. The inferior is the Fiumara here alluded to ; it is on the Meccan road, about four miles S.W. of Al-Madinah, and its waters fall into the Al-Hamra torrent. It is called the ' Blessed Valley ' because the Prophet was ordered by an angel to pray in it. 3 The esoteric meaning of this couplet is, ' Man ! this is a lovelyXIV. — From Bir Abha Al-Madinah, 279 and a thousand other such pretty things, have been said by the Arab poets. It was as ' dry as summer's dust,' and its ' beautiful trees ' appeared in the shape of vege table mummies. Half an hour after leaving the ' Blessed Valley ' we came to a huge flight of steps roughly cut in a long broad line of black scoriaceous basalt. This is termed the Mudarraj or flight of steps over the western ridge of the so-called Al-Harratayn. 1 It is holy ground; for the Apostle spoke well of it. Arrived at the top, we passed through a lane of dark lava, with steep banks on both sides, and after a few minutes a full view of the city sud denly opened upon us. 2 We halted our beasts as if by word of command. All of us descended, in imitation of the pious of old, and sat down, jaded and hungry as we were, to feast our eyes with a view of the Holy City. ' O Allah! this is the Harim (sanctuary) of Thy Apostle; make it to us a Protection from Hell Fire, and a Refuge from Eternal Punishment ! O open the Gates of Thy Mercy, and let us pass through them to the Land of Joy!' and 'O Allah, bless the last of Prophets, the Seal of Prophecy, with Blessings in number portion of God's creation : then stand by it, and here learn to love the perfections of thy Supreme Friend.' 1 Al-Harratayn for Al-Harratani. the oblique case of the dual and plural noun being universally used for the nominative in colloquial Arabic. The other one of the Two Ridges will be described in a future part of this Book. 2 The city is first seen from the top of the valley called Nakb, or Shuab Ali, close to the Wady al-Akik, a long narrow pass, about five miles from Al-Madinah. Here, according to some, was the Mosque Zu'l Halifah, where the Prophet put on the Pilgrim's garb when travelling to Meccah. It is also called 'The Mosque of the Tree,' because near it grew a fruit tree under which the Prophet twice sat. Ibn Jubayr considers that the Harim (or sacred precincts of Al- Madinah) is the space enclosed by three points, Zu'l Halifah, Mount Ohod. and the Mosque of Kuba. To the present day pilgrims doff their worldly garments at Zu'l Halifah.280 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. as the Stars of Heaven, and the Waves of the Sea, and the Sands of the Waste—bless him, O Lord of Might and Majesty, as long as the Corn-field and the Date- grove continue to feed Mankind 1 1' And again, ' Live for ever, O Most Excellent of Prophets!—live in the Shadow of Happiness during the Hours of Night and the Times of Day, whilst the Bird of the Tamarisk (the dove) moaneth like the childless Mother, whilst the West-wind bloweth gently over the Hills of Nijd, and the Lightning flasheth bright in the Firmament of Al-Hijaz!' Such were the poetical exclamations that rose all around me, showing how deeply tinged with imagination becomes the language of the Arab under the influence of strong passion or religious enthusiasm. I now under stood the full value of a phrase in the Moslem ritual, 'And when his' (the pilgrim's) 'eyes shall the Trees of Al -Madinah, let him raise his Voice and bless the Apostle with the choicest of Blessings.' In all the fair view before us nothing was more striking, after the desolation through which we had passed, than the gardens and orchards about the town. It was impossible not to enter into the spirit of my com panions, and truly I believe that for some minutes my enthusiasm rose as high as theirs. But presently when we remounted, 3 the traveller returned strong upon me: I made a rough sketch of the town, put questions about the principal buildings, and in fact collected materials for the next chapter. 1 That is to say, ' throughout all ages and all nations.' The Arabs divide the world into two great bodies; first themselves, and, secondly, ' 'Ajami,' i .e. all that are not Arabs. Similar bi-partitions are the Hindus and Mlenchhas, the Jews and Gentiles, the Greeks and Barbarians, &amp;c.

Taken from the Harrah (or Ridge) west of the Town. Burton^ delt sCHAPTER XV. through the suburb of al-madinah to hamid's house. As we looked Eastward, the sun arose out of the horizon of low hill, blurred and dotted with small tufted trees, which gained from the morning mists a giant stature, and the earth was stained with purple and gold. Before us lay a spacious plain, bounded in front by the undulating ground of Nijd : on the left w-as a grim pile of rocks, the celebrated Mount Ohod, with a clump of verdure and a white dome or two nestling at its base. Rightwards, broad streaks of lilac-coloured mists, here thick with gathered dew, there pierced and thinned by the morning rays, stretched over the date groves and the gardens of Kuba, which stood out in emerald green from the dull tawny surface of the plain. Below, dis tant about two miles, lay Al-Madinahat first sight it appeared a large place, but a closer inspection proved the impression to be erroneous. A tortuous road from the Harrah to the city wound across the plain, and led to a tall rectangular gateway, pierced in the ruinous mud-wall which surrounds the suburb. This is the ' Ambari' entrance. It is flanked on the left (speaking as a sketcher) by the domes and minarets of a pretty Turkish building, a ' Takiyah,' erected by the late Mo hammed All for the reception of Darwaysh travellers ; on the right by a long low line of white-washed buildings gam-286 Pilgrimage to A l-Madinah Meccah. ished with ugly square windows, an imitation of civilised barracks. Beginning from the left hand, as we sat upon the ridge, the remarkable features of the town thus pre sented themselves in succession. Outside, among the palm trees to the north of the city, were the picturesque ruins of a large old Sahil, or public fountain; and, between this and the enceinte, stood a conspicuous building, in the Turkish pavilion style—the Governor's palace. On the north-west angle of the town-wall is a tall white-washed fort, partly built upon an outcropping mass of rock; its ramparts and embrasures give it a modern and European appearance, which contrasts strangely with its truly Oriental history. 1 In the suburb ' Al-Manakhah,' the ' kneeling-place of camels,' the bran-new domes and minarets of the Five Mosques stand brightly out from the dull grey mass of house and ground. And behind, in the most Easterly part of the city, remarkable from afar, is the gem of Al-Madinah,—the four tall substantial towers, and the flashing green Dome under which the Apostle's remains rest. 2 Half concealed by this mass of buildings and by the houses of the town, are certain white specks upon a green surface, the tombs that adorn the venerable cemetery, Al-Bakia. From that point southwards begins the mass of palm groves celebrated in Al-Islam as the 'Trees of Al- 1 In the East, wherever there is a compound of fort and city, that place has certainly been in the habit of being divided against itself. Surat in Western India is a well-known instance. I must refer the reader to Burckhardt (Travels in Arabia, vol. ii., page 281, and onwards) for a detailed account of the feuds and affrays between the ' Agha of the Castle ' and the ' Agha of the Town.' Their day has now gone by,—for the moment. 2 Sir John Mandeville, writing in the 14th century, informed Europe that ' Machomet lyeth in the Cytee of Methone.' In the 19th century, Mr. Halliwell, his editor, teaches us in a foot-note that ' Methone ' is Meccah! It is strange how often this gross mis take is still made by respectable authors in France as well as in England^XV.— Through the Hamid's 287 Madinah.' The foreground is well fitted to set off such e sa t upon a view ; fields of black basaltic scoriae showing clear signs thus pre, 0 f a volcanic origin, are broken up into huge blocks and rao ng the boulders, through which a descent, tolerably steep for '^turesquj camels, winds down into the plain. d) between After a few minutes' rest I remounted, and slowly iag-intlie rode on towards the gate. Even at this early hour the • On tk way was crowded with an eager multitude coming out to ite-washej meet the Caravan. My companions preferred walking, rock; its apparently for the better convenience of kissing, em- Europeat bracing, and skaking hands with relations and friends, its trulj Truly the Arabs show more heart on these occasions M' th than any Oriental people I know; they are of a more iomes anj affectionate nature than the Persians, and their manners r out from are far more demonstrative than those of the Indians, id behind. The respectable Maryam's younger son, a pleasant con- emarkabli trast to her surly elder, was weeping aloud for joy as he : four tal ran round his mother's camel, he standing on tiptoe, she Draeundei bending double in vain attempts to exchange a kiss ; and, concealed generally, when near relatives or intimates, or school es of thi companions, met, the fountains of their eyes were 1 surface opened. Friends and comrades greeted one another, Ai-Bakia regardless of rank or fortune, with affectionate embraces, 3 of palir and an abundance of queries, which neither party seemed es of A1 to think of answering. The general mode of saluting was to throw one arm over the shoulder and the other ieT^ate round the side, placing the chin first upon the left and I j — then upon the right collar-bone, and rapidly shifting till L.pageaSi, a 11 jam satis' suggested itself to both parties.

The thoroughfare is by no means remarkable after Cairo; only it is rather wider and more regular 1 than the traveller is accustomed to in Asiatic cities. I I was astonished to see on both sides of the way, in so j small a place, so large a number of houses too ruinous to be occupied. Then we crossed a bridge, a single little round arch of roughly hewn stone, built over the bed of a torrent, Al-Sayh, 1 which in some parts appeared about fifty feet broad, with banks showing a high and deeply indented water-mark. Here the road abuts upon an open space called the 'Barr al-Manakhah, 2 ' or more concisely Al-Barr, ' the Plain.' Straightforward a line leads directly into the Bab al-Misri, the Egyptian gate of the city. But we turned off to the right; and, after advancing a few yards, we found ourselves at the entrance of our friend Hamid's house. The Shaykh had preceded us early that morning, in order to prepare an apartment for his guests, and to re ceive the first loud congratulations and embraces of his mother and the 'daughter of his uncle. 3 ' Apparently he had not concluded this pleasing duty when we arrived, for the camels were kneeling at least five minutes at his door, before he came out to offer the usual hospitable salutation. I stared to see the difference of his appear ance this morning. The razor had passed over his head 1 This torrent is called Al-Sayh,—' the Running Water, — which, properly speaking, is the name of a well-wooded Wady out side the town, in the direction of Kuba. 2 ' Manakhah ' is a place where camels kneel down; it is a deriva tion from the better known root to 'Nakh,' or cause the animal to kneel. 3 Arabs, and, indeed, most Orientals, are generally received after returning from a journey, with shrill cries of joy by all the fair part of the household, and they do not like strangers to hear this demon stration.XV.— Through the Suburb 289 and face 1 ; the former was now surmounted by a fnuslin turband of goodly size, wound round a new embroidered cap; and the latter, besides being clean, boasted of neat little moustaches turned up like two commas, whilst a well-trimmed goat's beard narrowed until it resembled what our grammars call an ' exclamation point.' The dirty, torn shirt, with the bits of rope round the loins, had been exchanged for a Jubbah or outer cloak of light pink merinos, a long-sleeved Caftan of rich flowered stuff, a fine shirt of Ilalaili, 2 silk and cotton, and a sash of plaid pattern, elaborately fringed at both ends, and, for better display, wound round two-thirds of his body. His pantaloons were also of Halaili, with tasteful edgings about the ankles like a ' pantilette's,' while his bare and sun-burnt feet had undergone a thorough purification before being encased in new Mizz* (inner slippers), and Papush (outer slippers), of bright lemon-coloured leather of the newest and most fashionable Constantinopolitan cut. In one of his now delicate hands the Shaykh bore a mother- of-pearl rosary, token of piety ; in the other a hand some pipe with a jasmine stick, and an expensive amber mouth-piece; his tobacco pouch, dangling from his waist, like the little purse in the bosom pocket of his coat, was of broadcloth richly em broidered with gold. In course of time I saw that all 1 An Eastern Barber is not content to pass the razor over hairy spots: he must scrape the forehead, trim the eyebrows, clean the cheeks, run the blade rapidly over the nose, correct the upper and under lines of the mustaches, parting them in the centre, and so on. 2 Halaili is a cotton stuff, with long stripes of white silk, a favourite material amongst the city Arabs. At Constantinople, where the best is sold, the piece, which will cut into two shirts, costs about thirty shillings. 3 The 'Mizz' (in colloquial Arabic Misd) are the tight-fitting inner slippers of soft Cordovan leather, worn as stockings inside the slipper; they are always clean, so they may be retained in the Mosque or on the Diwan (divan or sofa). vol. i. 19ago Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah my companions had metamorphosed themselves in an equally remarkable manner. As men of sense they appeared in tatters where they were, or when they wished to be, unknown, and in fine linen where and when the world judged their prosperity by their attire. Their grand suits of clothes, therefore, were worn only for a few days after returning from the journey, by way of proof that the wearer had wandered to some purpose ; they were afterwards laid up in lavender, and reserved for choice occasions, as old ladies in Europe store up their state dresses. The Shaykh, whose manners had changed with his garments, from the vulgar and boisterous to a certain staid courtesy, took my hand, and led me up to the Majlis 1 (parlour), which was swept and garnished, with all due apparatus, for the forthcoming reception-ceremony. And behind us followed the boy Mohammed, looking more downcast and ashamed of himself than I can possibly describe; he was still in his rags, and he felt keenly that every visitor staring at him would mentally inquire,— 'Who may that snob be?' With the deepest dejectedness he squeezed himself into a corner, and Shaykh Nur, who was foully dirty, as an Indian en voyage always is, would have joined him in his shame, had I not ordered the 'slave' to make himself generally useful. It is customary for all relations and friends to call upon the traveller the very day he returns, that is to say, if amity is to endure. The pipes therefore stood ready filled, the Diwans were duly spread, and the coffee 2 was being boiled upon a brazier in the passage. ^ 1 The Majlis (' the Place of Sitting ') is the drawing or reception room; it is usually in the first story of the house, below the apart ments of the women. 2 The coffee drank at Al-Madinah is generally of a good quality. In Egypt that beverage in the common coffee-shops is,—as required to be by the people who frequent those places,—' bitter as death, black as Satan, and hot as Jahannam.' To effect this desideratum,XV.— Through the Suburb 291 Scarcely had I taken my place at the cool window- sill,—it was the best in the room,—when the visitors began to pour in, and the Shaykh rose to welcome and embrace them. They sat down, smoked, chatted politics, asked all manner of questions about the other wayfarers and absent friends; drank coffee; and, after half an hour's visit, rose abruptly, and, exchanging embraces, took leave. The little men entered the assembly, after an accolade at the door, noiselessly, squatted upon the worst seats with polite conges to the rest of the assembly ; smoked, took their coffee, as it were, under protest, and glided out of the room as quietly as they crept in. The great people, generally busy and consequential individuals, upon whose countenances were writ large the words 'well to do in the world,' appeared with a noise that made each person in the room rise reverentially upon his feet; sat down with importance, monopolised the conversation; and, departing in a dignified manner, expected all to stand on the occasion. The Jihad (Holy War), as usual, was the grand topic of conversation. The Sultan had ordered the Czar to become a Moslem. The Czar had sued for peace, and offered tribute and fealty. But the Sultan had exclaimed— 'No, by Allah ! Al-Islam! ' therefore, they toast the grain to blackness, boil it to bitterness, and then drink scalding stuff of the consistency of water-gruel. At Al- Madinah, on the contrary,—as indeed in the houses of the better classes even in Egypt,—the grain is carefully picked, and that the flavour may be preserved, it is never put upon the fire until required. It is toasted too till it becomes yellow, not black; and afterwards is bruised, not pounded to powder. The water into which it is thrown is allowed to boil up three times, after which a cold sprinkling is administered to clear it, and then the fine light-dun infusion is poured off into another pot. Those who admire the ' Kaimak,' or froth, do not use a second vessel. The Arabs seldom drink more than one cup of coffee at a time, but with many the time is every half- hour of the day. The coffee-husk or 'Kishr ' of Al-Yaman is here unknown292 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. The Czar could not be expected to take such a step without a little hesitation, but ' Allah smites the faces of the Infidels!' Abd al-Majid would dispose of the 'Moskow 1 ' in a short time; after which he would turn his victorious army against all the idolaters of Feringistan, beginning with the English, the French, and the Arwam or Greeks. 2 Amongst much of this nonsense,—when applied to for my opinion, I was careful to make it popular,—I heard news foreboding no good to my journey towards Maskat. The Badawin had decided that there was to be an 'Arab contingent,' and had been looking forward to the spoils of Europe : this caused quarrels, as all the men wanted to go, and not a ten-year-old would be left behind. The consequence was, that this amiable people was fighting in all directions. At least so said the visitors, and I afterwards found out that they were not far wrong. The Samman is a great family, in numbers as in dignity; from 8 a.m . till mid-day therefore the Majlis was crowded with people, and politeness delayed our break fasts until an unconscionable hour. To the plague of strangers succeeded that of children. No sooner did the parlour become, comparatively speaking, vacant than they rushed in e treading upon our toes, making the noise of a nursery of madlings, p ullin g to pieces everything they could lay their hands upon, and using language that would have alarmed an old man-o'- war's-man. 3 In fact, no one can conceive the plague but 1 The common name for the Russians in Egypt and Al-Hijaz. 2 The Greeks are well known at Al-Madinah, and several of the historians complain that some of the minor holy places had fallen into the hands of this race, (Moslems, or pretended Moslems, I pre sume), who prevented people visiting them. It is curious that the impostor Cagliostro should have hit upon the truth when he located Greeks at Al-Madinah 3 Parents and full-grown men amuse themselves with grosslyXV.— Through the Suburb 293 those who have studied the ' enfans terribles ' which India sends home in cargoes. One urchin, scarcely three years old, told me, because I objected to his perching upon my wounded foot, that his father had a sword at home with which he would cut my throat from ear to ear, suiting the action to the word. By a few taunts, I made the little wretch furious with rage; he shook his infant fist at me, and then opening his enormous round black eyes to their utmost stretch, he looked at me, and licked his knee with portentous meaning. Shaykh Hamid, happening to come in at the moment, stood aghast at the doorway, chin in hand, to see the Effendi subject to such indignity ; and it was not without trouble that I saved the offender from summary nursery discipline. Another scamp caught up one of my loaded pistols before I could snatch it out of his hand, and clapped it to his neighbour's head; fortunately, it was on half-cock, and the trigger was stiff. Then a serious and majestic boy about six years old, with an ink stand in his belt, in token of his receiving a literary educa tion, seized my pipe and began to smoke it with huge puffs. I ventured laughingly to institute a comparison be tween the length of his person and the pipe-stick, when he threw it upon the ground, and stared at me fixedly with flaming eyes and features distorted by anger. The cause of this ' bouldness ' soon appeared. The boys, in stead of being well beaten, were scolded with fierce faces, a mode of punishment which only made them laugh. They had their redeeming points, however; they were manly angry boys, who punched one another like Anglo- Saxons in the house, whilst abroad they were always abusing children, almost as soon as they can speak, in order to excite their rage, and to judge of their dispositions. This supplies the infant population with a large stock-in-trade of ribaldry. They literally lisp in bad language.294 Pilgrimage to Al-Madim fighting with sticks and stones. And they examined our weapons,—before deigning to look at anything else,—as if eighteen instead of five had been the general age. At last I so far broke through the laws of Arab polite ness as to inform my host in plain words—how inconceiv ably wretched the boy Mohammed was thereby rendered ! —that I was hungry, thirsty, and sleepy, and that I wanted to be alone before visiting the Harim. The good- natured Shaykh, who was preparing to go out at once in order to pray before his father's grave, immediately brought me breakfast; lighted a pipe, spread a bed, darkened the room, turned out the children, and left me to the society I most desired—my own. I then overheard him summon his mother, wife, and other female relatives into the store-room, where his treasures had been carefully stowed away. During the forenoon, in the presence of the visitors, one of Hamid's uncles had urged him, half jocularly, to bring out the Sahharah. The Shaykh did not care to do anything of the kind. Every time a new box is opened in this part of the world, the owner's gener osity is appealed to by those whom a refusal offends, and he must allow himself to be plundered with the best pos sible grace. Hamid therefore prudently suffered all to depart before exhibiting his spoils; which, to judge by the exclamations of delight which they elicited from femi nine lips, proved highly satisfactory to those most con cerned. After sleeping, we all set out in a body to the Harim, as this is a duty which must not be delayed by the pious. The boy Mohammed was in better spirits,—the effect of having borrowed from Hamid, amongst other articles of clothing, an exceedingly gaudy embroidered coat. As for Shaykh Nur, he had brushed up his Tarbush, and, by means of some cast-off dresses of mine, had made himself look like a respectable Abyssinian slave, in a nondescript toilette, half Turkish, half Indian. I propose to reserveXV. Through the Suburb 295 the ceremony of Ziyarat, or Visitation, for another chap ter, and to conclude this with a short account of our style of living at the Shaykh's hospitable house. Hamid's abode is a small corner building, open on the North and East to the Barr al-Manakhah: the ground floor shows only a kind of vestibule, in which coarse articles, like old Shugdufs, mats and bits of sacking, are lying about; the rest are devoted to purposes of sewer age. Ascending dark winding steps of ragged stone covered with hard black earth, you come to the first floor, where the men live. It consists of two rooms to the front of the house, one a Majlis, and another converted into a store. Behind them is a dark passage, into which the doors open ; and the back part of the first story is a long windowless room, containing a Hanafiyah, 1 or large copper water-pot, and other conveniences for purification. On the second floor is the kitchen, which I did not inspect, it being as usual occupied by the ' Harim. The Majlis has dwarf windows, or rather apertures in the northern and eastern walls, with rude wooden shutters and reed blinds; the embrasures being garnished with cushions, where you sit, morning and evening, to enjoy the cool air. The ceiling is of date-sticks laid across palm -rafters stained red, and the walls are of rough scoriae, burnt bricks, and wood-work cemented with lime. The only signs of furniture in the sitting-room are a Diwan 2 round the sides and a carpet in the centre. A j The Hanafiyah is a large vessel of copper, sometimes tinned, with a cock in the lower part, and, generally, an ewer, or a basin, to receive the water. 2 It is wonderful that this most comfortable, inexpensive, and ornamental style of furnishing a room, has not been oftener imitated in India and the hot countries of Europe. The Diwan it must not be confounded with the leathern perversion which obtains that name in our club smoking-rooms—is a line of flat cushions ranged round the room, either placed upon the ground, or on wooden benches, or on a step of masonry, varying in height according to the fashion of296 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah huge wooden box, like a seaman's chest, occupies one of the corners. In the southern wall there is a Suffah, or little shelf of common stone, sunk under a single arch; upon this are placed articles in hourly use, perfume- bottles, coffee-cups, a stray book or two, and sometimes a turband, to be out of the children's way. Two hooks on the western wall, hung jealously high up, hold a pair of pistols with handsome crimson cords and tassels, and half a dozen cherry-stick pipes. The centre of the room is never without one or more Shishas 1 (water pipes), and in the corner is a large copper brazier containing fire, with all the utensils for making coffee either disposed upon its broad brim or lying about the floor. The passage, like the stairs, is spread over with hard black earth, and is regularly watered twice a day during the hot weather. The household consisted of Hamid's mother, wife, some nephews and nieces, small children who ran about in a half-wild and more than half-nude state, and two African slave girls. When the Damascus Caravan came the day. When such foundation is used, it should be about a yard in breadth, and slope very gently from the outer edge towards the wall, for the greater convenience of reclining. Cotton-stuffed pillows, covered with chintz for summer, and silk for winter, are placed against the wall, and can be moved to make a luxurious heap; their covers are generally all of the same colour, except those at the end. The seat of honour is denoted by a small square cotton-stuffed silk coverlet, placed in one of the corners, which the position of the windows determines, the place of distinction being on the left of the host. Thus in Egypt you have a neatly-furnished room for £5 or 1 The Madinah Shisha is a large cocoa-nut, with a tall wooden stem, both garnished with brass ornaments; some trifling differences in the latter distinguish it from the Meccah pipe. Both are incon veniently mounted upon small brass tripods, and are easily over turned, scattering fire and water over the carpets. The 'lay,' or snakes, are the substantial manufacture of Al-Yaman. Some grandees at Al-Madinah have glass Turkish S and Constantinople snakes, which are of admirable elegance, compared with the clumsy and unsightly Arab inventions. (See page 80, ante.)XV.— Through the Subur Hamid's 297 in, it was further reinforced by the arrival of his three younger brothers. Though the house was not grand, it was made lively by the varied views out of the Majlis' windows. From the East, you looked upon the square Al-Barr, the town walls and houses beyond it, the Egyptian gate, the lofty minarets of the Harim, and the distant outlines of Jabal Ohod. 1 The north commanded a prospect of Mohammed's Mosque, one of the Khamsah Masajid, 2 or the five sub urban Mosques 3 ; of part of the fort-wall; and, when the Damascus Caravan came in, of the gay scene of the ' Prado ' beneath. The Majlis was tolerably cool during the early part of the day : in the afternoon the sun shone fiercely upon it. I have described the establishment at some length as a specimen of how the middle classes are lodged at Al-Madinah. The upper ranks affect Turkish and Egyptian luxuries in their homes, as I had an oppor tunity of seeing at Omar Effendi's house in the ' Barr;' and in these countries the abodes of the poor are every where very similar. Our life in Shaykh Hamid's house was quiet, but not disagreeable. I never once set eyes upon the face of woman, unless the African slave girls be allowed the title. Even these at first attempted to draw their ragged veils over their sable charms, and would not answer the simplest question; by degrees they allowed me to see them, and they ventured their voices to reply to me; still they never threw off a certain appearance of shame. 4 1 From this window I sketched the walls and the Egyptian gate of Al-Madinah. 2 ' Five mosques.' 3 This Mosque must not be confounded with the Harim. It is described in Chapter XV. 4 Their voices are strangely soft and delicate, considering the appearance of the organs from which they proceed. Possibly this may be a characteristic of the African races; it is remarkable amongst the Somali women.298 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. I never saw, nor even heard, the youthful mistress of the household, who stayed all day in the upper rooms. The old lady, Hamid's mother, would stand upon the stairs, and converse aloud with her son, and, when few people were about the house, with me. She never, however, as afterwards happened to an ancient dame at Meccah, came and sat by my side. When lying during mid-day in the gallery, I often saw parties of women mount the stairs to the Gynaeconitis, and sometimes an individual would stand to shake a muffled hand 1 with Hamid, to gossip awhile, and to put some questions concerning absent friend^ ; but they were most decorously wrapped up, nor did they ever deign to deroger, even by exposing an inch of cheek. At dawn we arose, washed, prayed, and broke our fast 2 upon a crust of stale bread, before smoking a pipe, and drinking a cup of coffee. 8 Then it was time to dress, to mount, and to visit the Harim or one of the Holy Places outside the city. Returning before the sun became intolerable, we sat together, and with conversation, Shishas'and Chibuks, 4 coffee, and cold water perfumed with mastich-smoke, 5 we whiled away the time till our 1 After touching the skin of a strange woman, it is not lawful in Al-Islam to pray without ablution.

Hence it is called Fakkur' rik, also Gura and Tasbih: the Egyptians call it ' Al-Fatur.' 3 Orientals invariably begin by eating an ' akratisma' in the morning before they will smoke a pipe, or drink a cup of coffee; they have also an insuperable prejudice against the internal use of cold water at this hour. 4 The tobacco generally smoked here is Syrian, which is brought down in large quantities by the Damascus caravan. Latakia is more expensive, and generally too dry to retain its flavour. 5 The interior of the water jar is here perfumed with the smokeXV.—Through the Suburb IIamid's 299 ' Ariston,' a dinner which appeared at the primitive hour of 11 a.m . The meal, here called Al-Ghada, was served in the Majlis on a large copper tray, sent from the upper apartments. Ejaculating ' Bismillah'—the Moslem 'grace'—we all sat round it, and dipped equal hands in the dishes set before us. We had usually unleavened bread, different kinds of meat and vegetable stews ; and, at the end of the first course, plain boiled rice eaten with spoons ; then came the fruits, fresh dates, grapes, and pomegranates. After dinner I used invariably to find some excuse— such as the habit of a ' Kaylulah 1 ' (mid-day siesta) or the being a ' Saudawi 2 '—a person of melancholy tempera ment—to have a rug spread in the dark passage behind of mastich, exactly as described by Lane, {Mod. Egyptians, vol. i. eh. 5). I found at Al-Madinah the prejudice alluded to by Sonnini, namely, that the fumes of the gum are prejudicial, and sometimes fatal to invalids. 1 Kaylulah is the half hour's siesta about noon. It is a Sunnat, and the Prophet said of it, ' Kilu, fa inna 'sh' Shayatina \k Takil,'— M Take the mid-day siesta, for, verily, the demons sleep not at this hour.' ''Aylulah ' is slumbering after morning prayers (our 11 beauty sleep'), which causes heaviness and inability to work. Ghaylulah is the sleeping about 9 a.m., the effect of which is poverty and wretched ness. i^aylulah (with the guttural kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers, a practice reprobated in every part of the East. And, finally, Faylulah is sleeping immediately after sunset,—also considered highly detrimental. 2 The Arabs, who suffer greatly from melancholia, are kind to people afflicted with this complaint; it is supposed to cause a distaste for society, and a longing for solitude, an unsettled habit of mind, and a neglect of worldly affairs. Probably it is the effect of over working the brain, in a hot dry atmosphere. I have remarked, that in Arabia students are subject to it, and [that amongst their philoso phers and literary men, there is scarcely an individual who was not spoken of as a 41 Saudawi. M My friend Omar Effendi used to com plain, that at times his temperament drove him out of the house,— so much did he dislike the sound of the human voice,—to pass the day seated upon some eminence in the vicinity of the city.300 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah the Majlis ; and there to lie reading, dozing, smoking, or writing, en cachet te, in complete all through the worst part of the day, from noon to sunset. Then came the hour for receiving or paying visits. We still kept up an intimacy with Omar Effendi and Sa'ad the Demon, although Salih Skakkar and Amm Jamal, either disliking our society, or perhaps thinking our sphere of life too humble for their dignity, did not appear once in Hamid's house. The evening prayers ensued, either at home, or in the Harim, followed by our Asha or ' deipnon,' another substantial meal like the dinner, but more plentiful, of bread, meat, vegetables, plain rice and fruits, concluding with the invariable pipes and coffee. To pass our soiree, we occasionally dressed in common clothes, shouldered a Nabbut, 1 and went to the some times on festive occasions we indulged in a Taatumah (or Itmiyah), a late supper of sweetmeats, pomegranates, and dried fruits. Usually we sat upon mattresses spread upon the ground in the open air at the Shaykh's door; receiving evening visits, chatting, telling stories, and making merry, till each, as he felt the approach of the drowsy god, sank down into his proper place, and fell asleep. Whatever may be the heat of the day, the night at Al-Madinah, owing, I suppose, to its elevated position, is cool and pleasant. In order to allay the dust, the ground before the Shaykh's door was watered every evening, and the evaporation was almost too great to be safe,—the boy Mohammed suffered from a smart attack of lumbago, i This habit of going out at night in common clothes, with a Nabbut upon one's shoulders, is, as far as I could discover, popular at Al-Madinah, but confined to the lowest classes at Meccah. The boy Mohammed always spoke of it with undisguised disapprobation. During my stay at Meccah, I saw no such costume amongst respect able people there; though oftentimes there was a suspicion of a disguise.XV.— Through the Suburb Hamid's 301 which, however, yielded readily to frictions of olive oil in which ginger had been boiled. Our greatest inconvenience at night-time was the pugnacity of the animal creation. The horses of the troopers tethered in the Barr were sure to break loose once in twelve hours. Some hobbled old nag, having slipped the headstall, would advance with kangaroo-leaps towards a neighbour against whom it had a private grudge. Their heads would touch for a moment ; then came a snort and a whinny, a furious kick, and, lastly, a second horse loose and dashing about with head and tail viciously cocked. This was the signal for a general breaking of halters and heel-ropes; after which, a ' stampede ' scoured the plain, galloping, rearing, kicking, biting, snorting, pawing, and screaming, with the dogs barking sympathetically, and the horse-keepers shouting in hot pursuit. It was a strange sight to see by moonlight the forms of these ' demon steeds' exaggerated by the shades ; and, on more than one occasion, we had all to start up precipitately from our beds, and yield them to a couple of combatants who were determined to fight out their quarrel a 1'entrance, wherever the battle-field might be. The dogs at Al-Madinah are not less pugnacious than the horses. 1 They are stronger and braver than those that haunt the streets at Cairo ; like the Egyptians, they have amongst themselves a system of police regula tions, which brings down all the upon the unhappy straggler who ventures into a strange quarter of the town. They certainly met in Al-Barr upon common i Burckhardt (Travels in Arabia, vol. ii., p. 268) remarks that Al-Madinah is the only town in the East from which dogs are ex cluded. This was probably as much a relic of Wahhabi-ism, (that sect hating even to look at a dog), as arising from apprehension of the Mosque being polluted by canine intrusion. I have seen one or two of these animals in the town, but I was told, that when they enter it in any numbers, the police-magistrate issues orders to have them ejected.302 Pilgrimage to Al-Madim Meccah. ground, to decide the differences which must arise in so artificial a state of canine society. Having had many opportunities of watching them, I can positively assert that they were divided into two parties, which fought with a skill and an acharnement that astounded me. Sometimes when one side gave way, and as the retreat was degenerating into a some proud warrior, a dog-hero, would sacrifice himself for the public weal, and with gnashing teeth and howls of rage encounter the assaults of the insolent victors until his flying friends had time to recover heart. Such an one my companions called 'Mubariz. 1 ' At other times, some huge animal, an Ajax of his kind, would plunge into the ring with frantic yells, roll over one dog, snap at a second, worry a third for a minute or two, and then dash off to a distant part, where a thicker field required his presence. This uncommon sagacity has been remarked by the Arabs, who look on amused at their battles. Current in Al-Hijaz are also certain superstitions about the dog resembling ours ; only, as usual, more poetical and less grotesque. Most people believe that when the animal howls without apparent cause in the neighbour hood of a house, it forbodes death to one of the inmates ; for the dog they say can distinguish the awful form of Azrail, the Angel of Death, hovering over the doomed abode, whereas man's spiritual sight is dull and dim by reason of his sins. When the Damascus Caravan entered Al-Madinah, our day became a little more amusing. From the windows of Shaykh Hamid's house there was a perpetual succession of strange scenes. A Persian nobleman, also, had pitched his tents so near the door, that the whole course of his private life became public and patent to the boy Moham- i The 'Mubariz' is the single combatant, the champion of the Arabian classical and chivalrous times.XV.— Through the Suhurb Hamid's 303 ar Keiusi med, who amused his companions by reporting all manner of ludicrous scenes. The Persian's wife was rather a pretty woman, and she excited the youth's fierce indigna tion, by not veiling her face when he gazed at her,— thereby showing that, as his beard was not grown, she considered him a mere boy. 'I will ask her to marry me,' said Mohammed, 'and thereby rouse her shame ! ' He did so, but, unhappy youth! the fair Persian never even ceased fanning herself. The boy Mohammed was for once confounded. i Al-MaW ,ni the winte tual success 50, had ptt e course ofle ie boyMoto champion^CHAPTER XVI A VISIT TO THE PROPHET'S TOMB. Having performed the greater ablution, and used the toothstick as directed, and dressed ourselves in white clothes, which the Apostle loved, we were ready to start upon our holy errand. As my foot still gave me great pain, Shaykh Hamid sent for a donkey. A wretched animal appeared, raw-backed, lame of one leg, and want ing an ear, with accoutrements to match, a pack-saddle without stirrups, and a halter instead of a bridle. Such as the brute was, however, I had to mount it, and to ride through the Misrigate, to the wonder of certain Badawin, who, like the Indians, despise the ass. •' Honourable is the riding of a horse to the rider, But the mule is a dishonour, and the donkey a disgrace,' says their song. The Turkish pilgrims, however, who appear to take a pride in ignoring all Arab points of pre judice, generally mount donkeys when they cannot walk. The Badawin therefore settled among themselves, audibly enough, that I was an Osmanli, who of course could not understand Arabic, and they put the question generally, ' By what curse of Allah had they been subjected to ass-riders ? ' But Shaykh Hamid is lecturing me upon the subject of the Mosque. The Masjid Al-Nabawi, or the Prophet's Mosque, is one of the Haramayn, or the ' two sanctuaries ' of Al-XVI. — A Visit to t Islam, and is the second of the three 1 most venerable places of worship in the world ; the other two being the Masjid al-Harim at Meccah (connected with Abraham) and the Masjid al-Aksa of Jerusalem (the peculiar place of Solomon). A Hadis or traditional saying of Moham med asserts, ' One prayer in this my Mosque is more efficacious than a thousand in other places, save only the Masjid al-Harim. 2 ' It is therefore the visitor's duty, as long as he stays at Al-Madinah, to pray there per diem, to pass the day in it reading the Koran, and the night, if possible, in watching and devotion. A visit to the Masjid al-Nabawi, and the holy spots within it, is technically called ' Ziyarat ' or Visitation. 8 An essential difference is made between this rite and Hajj or pilgrimage. The latter is obligatory by Koranic order upon every Moslem once in his life: the former is only a meritorious action. ' Tawaf,' or circumambula- tion of the House of Allah at Meccah, must never be performed at the Apostle's tomb. This should not be visited in the Ihram or pilgrim dress; men should not kiss it, touch it with the hand, or press the bosom against it, as at the Ka'abah; or rub the face with dust collected near the sepulchre; and those who prostrate themselves before it, like certain ignorant Indians, are held to be 1 Others add a fourth, namely, the Masjid al-Takwa, at Kuba. 2 The Moslem divines, however, naively remind their readers, that they are not to pray once in the Al-Madinah Mosque, and neglect the other 999, as if absolved from the necessity of them. The passage in the text merely promises 1000 blessings upon that man's devotion who prays at the Prophet's Mosque. 3 The visitor, who approaches the Sepulchre as a matter of re ligious ceremony, is called 'Zair,' his conductor 'Muzawwir,' H whereas the pilgrim at Meccah becomes a 'Haji.' The Imam theSlltijffl disapproved of a Moslem's saying, 'I have visited the Prophet's tomb,' preferring him to express himself thus—'I have MosquM visited the Prophet.' Others again dislike the latter formula, de- - ' 0 f I daring the Prophet too venerable tp be so visited by Amr and Zayd. 16 VOL. I. 20306 Pilgrimage to Al-Madin Meccah. guilty of deadly sin. On the other hand, to spit upon any part of the Mosque, or to treat it with contempt, is held to be the act of an Infidel. Thus the learned and religious have settled, one would have thought, accurately enough the spiritual rank and dignity of the Masjid al-Nabawi. But man kind, especially in the East, must always be in ex tremes. The orthodox school of Al-Malik holds Al- Madinah, on account of the sanctity of, and the religious benefits to be derived from, Mohammed's tomb, more honourable than Meccah. Some declare that the Apostle preferred his place of refuge, blessing it as Abra ham did Meccah. Moreover, as a tradition declares that every man's body is drawn from the ground in which he is buried, Al-Madinah evidently had the honour of supplying materials for the Apostle's person. Others, like Omar, were uncertain which to prefer. The Wahhabis, on the other hand, rejecting the Intercession of the Apostle on the Day of Judgment, considering the grave of a mere mortal unworthy of notice, and highly disgusted by the idolatrous respect paid to it by certain foolish Moslems, plundered the sacred building with sacrilegious violence, and forbade visitors from distant countries to enter Al-Madinah. 1 The general consensus of Al-Islam admits the superi ority of the Bciyt Allah (' House of God ') at Meccah to the whole world; and declares Al-Madinah to be more venerable than every part of Meccah, and consequently all the earth, except only the Bayt Allah. This last is a juste milieu view by no means in favour with the inhabi tants of either place. In the meanwhile the Meccans claim unlimited superiority over the Madani: the Madani over the Meccans. i In a.d. 1807, they prevented Ali Bey (the Spaniard Badia) from entering Al-Madinah, and it appears that he had reason to con gratulate himself upon escaping without severe punishment.XVI. — A Visit to t Tomh. 307 Passing through muddy streets,—they had been freshly watered before evening time,—I came suddenly upon the Mosque. Like that at Meccah, the approach is choked up by ignoble buildings, some actually touching the holy ' enceinte,' others separated by a lane compared with which the road round St. Paul's is a Vatican Square. 1 There is no outer front, no general prospect of the Pro phet's Mosque; consequently, as a building, it has neither beauty nor dignity. And entering the Bab al-Rahmah 2 —the Gate of Pity, —by a diminutive flight of steps, I was astonished at the mean and tawdry appearance of a place so universally venerated in the Moslem world. It is not, like the Meccan Temple, grand and simple, the expression of a single sublime idea : the longer I looked at it, the more it suggested the resemblance of a museum of second-rate art, an old Curiosity-shop, full of ornaments that are not accessories, and decorated with pauper splendour. The Masjid al-Nabi is a parallelogram about four hundred and twenty feet in length by three hundred and forty broad, the direction of the long walls being nearly north and south. As usual in Al-Islam, it is a hypae- thral building with a spacious central area, called Al- Sahn, Al-Hosh, Al-Haswah, or Al-Ramlah, 8 surrounded by a peristyle with numerous rows of pillars like the col onnades of an Italian cloister. The arcades or porticoes are flat-ceilinged, domed above with the small 1 Nothing in the Spanish cathedrals suggests their Oriental origin and the taste of the people, more than the way in which they are hedged in by secular buildings. 2 The ceremony of Ziyarat, however, begins at the Bab al-Salam. We rode up to this gate only in order to avoid the sun. 3 Haswah is a place covered with gravel: Ramlah, one which is sanded over. Both are equally applicable, and applied to the areas of Mosques. Al-Sahn is the general word; Al-Hosh is occasionally used, but is more properly applied to the court-yard of a dwelling- house.308 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Naranja, or half-orange cupola of Spain, and divided into four parts by narrow passages, three or four steps below the level of the pavement. Along the whole inner length of the Northern short wall runs the Majidi Riwak, so called from the then reigning Sultan. 1 The Western long wall is occupied by the Riwak of the Rahmah Gate; the Eastern by that of the Bab al-Nisa, the ' Women's Entrance. 2 ' Embracing the inner length of the Southern short wall, and deeper by nearly treble the amount of columns than the other porticoes, is the main colonnade, called Al-Rauzah s (the Garden), the adytum containing all that is venerable in the building. These four Riwaks, arched externally, are supported internally by pillars of different shape and material, varying from fine porphyry to dirty plaster. The Southern, where the sepulchre or cenotaph stands, is paved with handsome slabs of white marble and marquetry work, here and there covered with coarse matting, and above this by unclean carpets, well worn by faithful feet. 4 But this is not the time for Tafarruj or lionising. 1 This Riwak was begun about five or six years ago by Abd al-Majid. To judge from the size of the columns, and the other pre parations which encumber the ground, this part of the building will surpass all the rest But the people of Al-Madinah assured me that it will not be finished for some time,—a prophecy likely to be fulfilled by the present state of Turkish finance. 2 This gate derives its peculiar name from its vicinity to the Lady Fatimah's tomb; women, when they do visit the Mosque, enter it through all the doors indifferently. 3 It is so called by the figure synecdoche: it contains the Rauzah or the Prophet's Garden, and therefore the whole portico enjoys that honoured name. 4 These carpets are swept by the eunuchs, who let out the office for a certain fee to pilgrims, every morning, immediately after sun rise.

He leads me to the Bab al-Salam, fighting his way through a troop of beggars, and inquires markedly if I am religiously pure. 1 Then, placing our hands a little below and on the left of the waist, the palm of the right covering the back of the left, in the position of prayer, and beginning with the dexter feet, 2 we pace slowly forwards down the line called the Muwajihat al-Sharifah, or 'the Illustrous Fronting,' which, divided off like an aisle, runs parallel with the Southern wall of the Mosque. On my right hand walks the Shaykh, who recites aloud the following prayer, making me repeat it after him. 3 It is literally rendered, as, indeed, are all the formulae, and the reader is requested to excuse the barbarous fidelity of the translation. ' In the Name of Allah and in the faith of Allah's Apostle! O Lord, cause me to enter the Entering of Truth, and cause me to issue forth the Issuing of Truth, and permit me to draw near to Thee, and make me a Sultan Victorious 4 ! ' Then follow blessings upon the Apostle, and afterwards: 'O Allah! open to me the Doors of Thy Mercy, and grant me Entrance into it, and protect me from the Stoned Devil! During this preliminary prayer we had passed down two-thirds of the Muwajihat al-Sharifah. On the left hand is a dwarf wall, about the height of a man, painted with arabesques, and pierced with four small doors which 1 Because if not pure, ablution is performed at the well in the centre of the hypaethra. Zairs are ordered to visit the Mosque per fumed, and in their best clothes, and the Hanafi school deems it lawful on this occasion only to wear dresses of pure silk. 2 In this Mosque, as in all others, it is proper to enter with the right foot, and to retire with the left. 3 I must warn the reader that almost every ' Muzawwir has his own litany, which descends from father to son: moreover^ all the books differ at least as much as do the oral authorities. 4 That is to say, 'over the world, the flesh, and the devil.'310 Pilgrimage to Al-Madimh and Meccah. open into the Muwajihat. In this barrier are sundry small erections, the niche called the Mihrab Sulaymani, 1 the Mambar, or pulpit, and the Mihrab al-Nabawi. 2 The two niches are of beautiful mosaic, richly worked with various coloured marbles, and the pulpit is a graceful collection of slender columns, elegant tracery, and inscrip tions admirably carved. Arrived at the Western small door in the dwarf wall, we entered the celebrated spot called Al-Rauzah, after a saying of the Apostle's, ^ Between my Tomb and my Pulpit is a Garden of the Gardens of Paradise. 3,, On the North and West sides it is 1 This by strangers is called the Masalla Shafe'i, or the Place of Prayer of the Shafe'i school. It was sent from Constantinople about 100 years ago, by Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent. He built the Sulaymaniyah minaret, and has immortalised his name at Al- Madinah, as well as at Meccah, by the number of his donations to the shrine. 2 Here is supposed to have been one of the Prophet's favourite stations of prayer. It is commonly called the Musalla Hanafi, because now appropriated by that school. 3 This tradition, like most others referring to events posterior to the Prophet's death, is differently given, and so important are the variations, that I only admire how all Al-Islam does not follow Wahhabi example, and summarily consign them to oblivion. Some read 'Between my dwelling-house (in the Mosque) and my place of Prayer (in the Barr al-Manakhah) is a Garden of the Gardens of Paradise.' 1 Others again, 'Between my house and my pulpit is a Garden of the Gardens of Paradise/' A third tradition—'Between my tomb and my pulpit is a Garden of the Gardens of Paradise, and verily my pulpit is in my Full Cistern,' or 'upon a Full Cistern of the Cisterns of Paradise,' has given rise to a new super stition. 'Tara,' according to some commentators, alludes especially to the cistern Al-Kausar; consequently this Rauzah is, like the black stone at Meccah, bond fide, a bit of Paradise, and on the day of resur rection, it shall return bodily to the place whence it came. Be this as it may, all Moslems are warned that the Rauzah is a most holy spot. None but the Prophet and his son-in-law Ali ever entered it, when ceremonially impure, without being guilty of deadly sin. The Mohammedan of the present day is especially informed that on no account must he here tell lies, or even perjure himself. ThusXVI.— A Visit to the ProTomh. 311 not divided from the rest of the portico; on the South runs the dwarf wall, and on the East it is limited by the west end of the lattice-work containing the tomb. Accompanied by my Muzawwir I entered the Rauzah, and was placed by him with the Mukabbariyah 1 behind me, fronting Meccah, with my right shoulder opposite to, and about twenty feet distant from, the dexter pillar of the Apostle's Pulpit. 2 There, after saying the afternoon prayers, 8 I performed the usual two bows in honour of the temple, 4 and at the end of them recited the hundred and ninth and the hundred and twelfth chapters of the Koran— the 'Kul, ya ayyuha'l-Kafiruna,' and the 'Surat al- Ikhlas,' called also the 'Kul, Huw' Allah,' or the Declaration of Unity; and may be thus translated: 'Say, He is the one God! 'The eternal God! ' He begets not, nor is He begot! the Rauzah must be respected as much as the interior of the Bayt Allah at Meccah. 1 This is a stone desk on four pillars, where the Muballighs (or clerks) recite the Ikamah, the call to divine service. It was presented to the Mosque by Kaid-Bey, the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt. 2 I shall have something to say about this pulpit when entering into the history of the Harim. 3 The afternoon prayers being Farz, or obligatory, were recited, because we feared that evening might come on before the ceremony of Ziyarat (visitation) concluded, and thus the time for Al-Asr (after noon prayers) might pass away. The reader may think this rather a curious forethought in a man who, like Hamid, never prayed except when he found the case urgent. Such, however, is the strict order, and my Muzawwir was right to see it executed. 4 This two-bow prayer, which generally is recited in honour of the Mosque, is here, say divines, addressed especially to the Deity by the visitor who intends to beg the intercession of his Prophet. It is only just to confess that the Moslems have done their best by all means in human power, here as well as elsewhere, to inculcate the doctrine of eternal distinction between the creature and the Creator. Many of the Maliki school, however, make the ceremony of Ziyarat to precede the prayer to the Deity.312 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinak 'And unto Him the like is not.' After which was performed a single Sujdah (Prostra tion) of Thanks, 1 in gratitude to Allah for making it my fate to visit so holy a spot. This being the recognised time to give alms, I was besieged by beggars, who spread their napkins before us on the ground, sprinkled with a few coppers to excite generosity. But not wishing to be distracted by them, before leaving Hamid's house I had changed two dollars, and had given the coin to the boy Mohammed, who accompanied me, strictly charging him to make that sum last through the Mosque. My answer to the beggars was a reference to my attendant, backed by the simple action of turning my pockets inside out ; and, whilst he was battling with the beggars, I proceeded to cast my first upon the Rauzah. The ' Garden ' is the most elaborate part of the Mosque. Little can be said in its praise by day, when it bears the same relation to a second-rate church in Rome as an English chapel-of-ease to Westminster Abbey. It is a space of about eighty feet in length, tawdrily decorated so as to resemble a garden. The carpets are flowered, and the pediments of the columns are cased with bright green tiles, and adorned to the height of a man with gaudy and unnatural vegetation in arabesque. It is disfigured by handsome branched candelabras of cut crystal, the work, I believe, of a London house, and presented to the shrine by the late Abbas Pasha of Egypt. 2 The only admirable feature of the view is the light 1 The Sujdah is a single 'prostration' with the forehead touch ing the ground. It is performed from a sitting position, after the Dua or supplication that concludes the two-bow prayer. Some of the Olema, especially those of the Shafe'i school, permit this 'Sujdah of thanks' to be performed before the two-bow prayer if the visitor have any notable reason to be grateful. 2 The candles are still sent from Cairo.XVI.—A Visit to 313 cast by the windows of stained glass 1 in the Southern wall. Its peculiar background, the railing of the tomb, a splendid filigree-work of green and polished brass, gilt or made to resemble gold, looks more picturesque near than at a dis tance, when it suggests the idea of a gigantic bird-cage. But at night the eye, dazzled by oil-lamps 2 suspended from the roof, by huge wax candles, and by smaller illumina tions falling upon crowds of visitors in handsome attire, with the richest and the noblest of the city sitting in con gregation when service is performed,® becomes less critical. Still the scene must be viewed with Moslem bias, and until a man is thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the East, the last place the Rauzah will remind him of, is that which the architect primarily intended it to resemble—a garden. Then with Hamid, professionally solemn, I reassumed the position of prayer, and retraced my steps. After passing through another small door in the dwarf wall that bounds the Muwajihah, we did not turn to the right, which would have led us to the Bab al-Salam; our course was in an opposite direction, towards the Eastern wall of the temple. Meanwhile we repeated, ' Verily Allah and His Angels 4 bles s the Apostle]! O ye who believe, bless him, 1 These windows are a present from Kaid-Bey, the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt, 2 These oil lamps are a present from the Sultan. 3 The five daily liturgies are here recited by Imams, and every one presses to the spot on account of its peculiar sanctity. 4 In Moslem theology 'Salat' from Allah means mercy, from the angels intercession for pardon, and from mankind blessing. The act of blessing the Prophet is one of peculiar efficacy in a religious point of view. Cases are quoted of sinners being actually snatched from hell by a glorious figure, the personification of the blessings which had been called down by them upon Mohammed's head. This most poetical idea is borrowed, I believe, from the ancient Guebres, who fabled that a man's good works assumed a beautiful female shape, which stood to meet his soul when winding its way to judg ment. Also when a Moslem blesses Mohammed at Al-Msdinah, his314 Pilgrimage to A and salute Him with Honour! ' At the end of this prayer, we arrived at the Mausoleum, which requires some descrip tion before the reader can understand the nature of our proceedings there. The Hujrah 1 or ' Chamber ' as it is called, from the circumstance of its having been Ayishah's room, is an irregular square of from fifty to fifty-five feet in the South- East corner of the building, and separated on all sides from the walls of the Mosque by a passage about twenty- six feet broad on the South side, and twenty on the East, The reason of this isolation has been before explained, and there is a saying of Mohammed's, ' O Allah, cause not my Tomb to become an Object of Idolatrous Adora tion ! May Allah's Wrath fall heavy upon the People who make the Tombs of their Prophets Places of Prayer 2 !' sins are not written down for three days,—thus allowing ample margin for repentance,—by the recording angel. Al-Malakayn (the two Angels), or Kiram al-Katibin (the Generous Writers), are mere personifications of the good principle and the evil principle of man's nature; they are fabled to occupy each a shoulder, and to keep a list of words and deeds. This is certainly borrowed from a more ancient faith. In Hermas II. (command. 6), we are told that 'every man has two angels, one of godliness, the other of iniquity,' who endeavour to secure his allegiance,—a superstition seemingly founded upon the dualism of the old Persians. Medieval Europe, which borrowed so much from the East at the time of the Crusades, degraded these angels into good and bad fairies for children 's stories. 1 Burckhardt writes this word Hedjra (which means 'flight ). Nor is M. Caussin de Perceval's ' El Hadjarat' less erroneous. At Madinah it is invariably called Al-Hujrah—the chamber. The chief difficulty in distinguishing the two words, meaning 'chamber' and 'flight,' arises from our only having one A to represent the hard and soft hof Arabic, V and V- In the case of common saints, the screen or railing round the cenotaph is called a'Maksurah.' 2 Yet Mohammed enjoined his followers to frequent graveyards. 'Visit graves; of a verity they shall make you think of futurity!'XVI. — A Visit to Prophet 's 315 Inside there are, or are supposed to be, three tombs facing the South, surrounded by stone walls without any aperture, or, as others say, by strong planking. 1 What ever this material may be, it is hung outside with a cur tain, somewhat like a large four-post bed. The external railing is separated by a dark narrow passage from the inner, which it surrounds ; and is of iron filigree painted of a vivid grass green,—with a view to the garden. Here carefully inserted in the verdure, and doubly bright by contrast, is the gilt or burnished brass work forming the long and graceful letters of the Suls character, and dis posed into the Moslem creed, the Profession of Unity, and similar religious sentences. On the South side, for greater honour, the railing is plated over with silver, and silver letters are interlaced with it. This fence, which connects the columns and forbids passage to all men, may be compared to the baldacchino of Roman churches. It has four gates : that to the South is the Bab al-Muwajihah ; Eastward is the gate of our Lady Fdtimah ; westward the Bab al-Taubah (of Repentance), opening into the Rauzah or garden ; and to the North, the Bab al-Shami or Syrian gate. They are constantly kept closed, except the fourth, which admits, into the dark narrow passage above alluded to, the officers who have charge of the treasures there deposited ; and the eunuchs who sweep the floor, light And again, ' Whoso visiteth his two parents' grave, or one of the two, every Friday, he shall be written a pious child, even though he might have been in the world, before that, a disobedient.' 1 The truth is no one knows what is there. I have even heard a learned Persian declare that there is no wall behind the curtain, which hangs so loosely that, when the wind blows against it, it defines the form of a block of marble, or a built-up tomb. I believe this to be wholly apocryphal, for reasons which will presently be offered.\ 316 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinak Meccah. the lamps, and carry away the presents sometimes thrown in here by devotees. 1 In the Southern side of the fence are three windows, holes about half a foot square, and placed from four to five feet above the ground ; they are said to be between three and four cubits distant from the Apostle's head. The most Westerly of these is supposed to front Moham med's tomb, wherefore it is called the Shubak al-Nabi, or the Prophet's window. The next, on the right as you front it, is Abu Bakr's, and the most Easterly of the three is Omar's. Above the Hujrah is the Green Dome, surmounted outside by a large gilt crescent springing from a series of globes. The glowing imaginations of the Moslems crown this gem of the building with a pillar of heavenly light, which directs from three days' distance the pilgrims' steps towards Al-Madinah. But alas ! none save holy men (and perhaps, odylic sensitives), whose material organs are piercing as their spiritual vision, may be allowed the privilege of beholding this poetic splendour. Arrived at the Shubak al-Nabi, Hamid took his stand about six feet or so out of reach of the railing, and at that respectful distance from, and facing 3 the Hazirah (or pre- 1 The peculiar place where the guardians of the tomb sit and confabulate is the Dakkat al-Aghawat (eunuch's bench) or Al-Mayda —the table—a raised bench of stone and wood, on the North side of the Hujrah. The remaining part of this side is partitioned off from the body of the Mosque by a dwarf wall, inclosing the 'Khasafat al- Sultan,' the place where Fakihs are perpetually engaged in Khitmahs, or perusals of the Koran, on behalf of the reigning Sultan. 2 The ancient practice of Al-Islam during the recitation of the following benedictions was to face Meccah, the back being turned towards the tomb, and to form a mental image of the Prophet, sup posing him to be in front. Al-Kirmani and other doctors prefer this as the more venerable custom, but in these days it is completely ex ploded, and the purist would probably be soundly bastinadoed by the eunuchs for attempting it.XVI.—A Visit to t Prophet''s 317 1.

Peace be upon Thee, O Chief of Prophets ! Peace be upon Thee, O Seal of the Prophets ! Peace be upon Thee, O Prince of the Pious ! Peace be upon Thee, O Apostle of the Lord of the (three) Worlds ! Peace be upon Thee, and upon Thy Family, and upon Thy pure Wives ! Peace be upon Thee, and upon all Thy Companions ! Peace be upon Thee, and upon all the Prophets, and upon those sent to preach Allah's Word ! Peace be upon Thee, and upon all Allah's righteous Worshippers !

Peace be upon Thee ! and Allah bless Thee ! and Allah repay Thee for us, O Thou Apostle of Allah ! the choicest of Blessings with which He ever blessed Prophet ! Allah bless Thee as often as Mentioners have mentioned Thee, and Forgetters have forgotten Thee ! And Allah bless Thee among the First and the Last, with the best, the highest, and the fullest of Blessings ever bestowed on Man; even as we escaped Error by means of Thee, and were made to see after Blindness, and after Ignorance were directed318 Pilgrimage to Al-Madim into the Right Way. I bear Witness that there is no god but the God (Allah), and I testify that Thou art His Ser vant, and His Apostle, and His Faithful Follower, and Best Creature. And I bear Witness, O Apostle of Allah! that Thou hast delivered thy Message, and discharged Thy Trust, and advised Thy Faith, and opened Grief, and published Proofs, and fought valiantly for Thy Lord, and worshipped Thy God till Certainty came to Thee to the hour of death). And we Thy Friends, O Apostle of Allah! appear before Thee, Travellers from distant lands and far Countries, through Dangers and Difficulties, in the Times of Darkness, and in the Hours of Day, longing to give Thee Thy Rights {i .e. to honour Thee by benediction and visitation), and to obtain the Blessings of Thine Inter cession, for our Sins have broken our Backs, and Thou intercedest with the Healer. And Allah said, 1 And though they have injured themselves, they came to Thee, and begged Thee to secure their Pardon, and they found God an Acceptor of Penitence, and full of Compassion.' O Apostle of Allah, Intercession ! Intercession ! Interces sion 2 ! O Allah, bless Mohammed and Mohammed's Family, and give Him Superiority and high Rank, even as Thou didst promise Him, and graciously allow us to conclude this Visitation. I deposit on this spot, and near Thee, O Apostle of God, my everlasting Profession (of faith) from this our Day, to the Day of Judgment, that there is no god but Allah, and that our Lord Mohammed is His Servant and His Apostle. 3 Amen ! O Lord of the (three) Worlds! 1 ' 1 This is the usual introduction to a quotation from the Koran. 2 It may easily be conceived how offensive this must be to the Wahhabis, who consider it blasphemy to assert that a mere man can stand between the Creator and the creature on the last day. 3 This is called the Testification. Like the Fatihah, it is re peated at every holy place and tomb visited at Al-Madinah. 4 Burckhardt mentions that in his day, among other favoursXVI.— A Visit to Tomb. 319 After which, performing Ziyarat 1 for ourselves, we repeated the Fatihahor 'opening' chapter of the Koran. ' In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compas sionate ! ' Praise be to Allah, who the (three) Worlds made. ' The Merciful, the Compassionate. ' The King of the Day of Faith. ' Thee (alone) do we worship, and of Thee (alone) do we ask Aid. ' Guide us to the Path that is straight— ' The Path of those for whom thy Love is great, not those on whom is Hate, nor they that deviate. ' Amen! O Lord of Angels, Jinnis, and Men ! 2 ' After reciting this mentally with upraised hands, the forefinger of the right hand being extended to its full length, we drew our palms down our faces and did alms- deeds, a vital part of the ceremony. Thus concludes the first part of the ceremony of visitation at the Apostle's tomb. supplicated in prayer to the Deity, the following request was made — 'Destroy our enemies, and may the torments of hell-fire be their lot!' I never heard it at the Prophet's tomb. As the above benediction is rather a long one, the Zair is allowed to shorten it but on no account to say less than 'Peace be upon Thee, O Apostle of Allah''—this being the gist of the ceremony. 1 Though performing Ziyarat for myself, I had promised my old Shaykh at Cairo to recite a Fatihah in his name at the Prophet's tomb; so a double recitation fell to my lot. If acting Zair for another person (a common custom, we read, even in the days of Al- Walid, the Caliph of Damascus), you are bound to mention your principal's name at the beginning of the benediction, thus: 'Peace be upon Thee, O Apostle of Allah from such an one, the son of such an one, who wants Thine Intercession, and begs for Pardon and Mercy.' Most Zairs recite Fatihahs for all their friends and relations at the tomb. 2 I have endeavoured in this translation to imitate the imperfect -hyme of the original Arabic. Such an attempt, however, is full of difficulties: the Arabic is a language in which, like Italian, it is almost impossible not to rhyme.320 Pilgrimage toAl-Madimh Meccah. Hamid then stepped about a foot and half to the right, and I followed his example, so as to place myself exactly opposite the second aperture in the grating called Abu Bakr's window. There, making a sign towards the mausoleum, we addressed its inmate, as follows :— ' Peace be upon Thee, O Abu Bakr, O Thou Truth ful One! Peace be upon Thee, O Caliph of Allah's Apostle over his People ! Peace be upon Thee, O Com panion of the Cave, and Friend in Travel! Peace be upon Thee, O Thou Banner of the Fugitives and the Auxiliaries! I testify Thou didst ever stand firm in the right Way, and wast a Smiter of the Infidel, and a Bene factor to Thine own people. Allah grant Thee through His Apostle Weal! We pray Almighty God to cause us to die in Thy Friendship, and to raise us up in Company with His Apostle and Thyself, even as He hath merci fully vouchsafed to us this Visitation. 1 ' After which we closed one more step to the right, and standing opposite Omar's window, the most easterly of the three, after making a sign with our hands, we ad dressed the just Caliph in these words ' Peace be upon Thee, O Omar! O Thou Just One! Thou Prince of True Believers ! Peace be upon Thee, who spakest with Truth, and who madest Thy Word agree with the Strong Book! (the Koran); O Thou Faruk! (the Separator). 2 O Thou Faithful One! who girdedst thy Loins with the Apostle, and the First Believers, and with them didst make up the full Number forty,® and thus causedst to be accomplished the Apostle's Prayer, 4 and 1 It will not be necessary to inform the reader more than once that all these several divisions of prayer ended with the Testification and the Fatihah. 2 Faruk,—the separator,—a title of Omar. 3 When the number of the Ashdb or 11 Companions' was thirty- nine, they were suddenly joined by Omar, who thus became the fortieth. 4 It is said that Mohammed prayed long for the conversion ofam XVI.— A Visit to 321 then didst return to Thy God a Martyr leaving the World with Praise! Allah grant Thee, through his Apostle and his Caliph and his Followers, the best of Good, and may Allah feel in Thee plenary Satisfaction !' Shaykh Hamid, after wrenching a beggar or two from my shoulders, then permitted me to draw near to the little window, called the Apostle's, and to look in. Here my proceedings were watched with suspicious eyes. The Persians have sometimes managed to pollute the part near AbuBakr's and Omar's graves by tossing through the aperture what is externally a handsome shawl in tended as a present for the tomb. 1 After straining my eyes for a time, I saw a curtain, 2 or rather hangings, with Omar to Al-Islam, knowing his sterling qualities, and the aid he would lend to the establishment of the faith. 1 This foolish fanaticism has lost many an innocent life, for the Arabs on these occasions seize their sabres, and cut down every Per sian they meet. Still, bigoted Shi'ahs persist in practising and applaud ing it, and the man who can boast at Shiraz of having defiled Abu Bakr's, Omar's, or Osman's tomb becomes at once a lion and a hero. I suspect that on some occasions when the people of Al- Madinah are anxious for an ' avanie,' they get up some charge of the kind against the Persians. So the Meccans have sometimes found these people guilty of defiling the house of Allah—at which In fidel act a Shi'ah would shudder as much as a Sunni. This style of sacrilege is, we read, of ancient date in Arabia. Nafil, the Hijazi, polluted the Kilis (Christian church) erected by Abrahah of Sanaa to outshine the Ka'abah, and draw off worshippers from Meccah. The outrage caused the celebrated 'affair of the Elephant.' (See D'Herbelot, Bibl. Or., v. 'Abrahah.') 2 Burckhardt, with his usual accuracy, asserts that a new curtain is sent when the old one is decayed, or when a new Sultan ascends the throne, and those authors err who, like Maundrell, declare the curtain to be removed every year. The Damascus Caravan conveys, together with its Mahmil or emblem of royalty, the new Kiswah (or ' garment ') when required for the tomb. It is put on by the eunuchs, who enter the baldaquin by its Northern gate at night time, and there is a superstitious story amongst the people that they guard their eyes with veils against the supernatural splendours which pour from the vol. 1. 2 j322 Pilgrimage to Al-Madim Meccah. three inscriptions in long gold letters, informing readers that behind them lie Allah's Apostle and the first two Caliphs. The exact place of Mohammed's tomb is moreover distinguished by a large pearl rosary, and a peculiar orna ment, the celebrated Kaukab-al-Du or constellation of pearls, suspended to the curtain breast-high. 1 This is described to be a 'brilliant star set in diamonds and pearls,' placed in the dark that man's eye may be able to bear its splendours: the vulgar believe it to be a 'jewel of the jewels of Paradise.' To me it greatly resembled the round glass stoppers used for the humbler sort of decanters ; but I thought the same of the Koh-i-Nur. Moreover I never saw it quite near enough to judge fairly, and I did not think fit to pay an exorbitant sum for the privilege of entering the inner passage of the baldaquin. 2 tomb. The Kiswah is a black, purple, or green brocade, embroi dered with white or with silver letters. A piece in my possession, the gift of Omar Effendi, is a handsome silk and cotton Damascus brocade, with white letters worked in it — manifestly the produce of manual labour, not the poor dull work of machinery. It contains the formula of the Moslem faith in the cursive style of the Suls char acter, seventy-two varieties of which are enumerated by calligraphists. Nothing can be more elegant or appropriate than its appearance. The old curtain is usually distributed amongst the officers of the Mosque, and sold in bits to pilgrims; in some distant Moslem coun tries, the possessor of such a relic would be considered a saint. When treating of the history of the Mosque, some remarks will be offered about the origin of the curtain. 1 The place of the Prophet's head is, I was told, marked by a fine Koran hung up to the curtain This volume is probably a successor to the relic formerly kept there, the Cufic Koran belonging to Osman, the fourth Caliph, which Burckhardt supposes to have perished in the conflagration which destroyed the Mosque. 2 The eunuchs of the tomb have the privilege of admitting strangers. In this passage are preserved the treasures of the place; they are a ' Bayt Mai al-Muslimin,' or public treasury of the Moslems; therefore to be employed by the Caliph the reigning Sultan) fof the exigencies of the faith.

At night, when the lamps, hung in this passage, shed a dim light upon the mosaic-work of the marble floors, upon the glittering inscriptions, and the massive hangings, the scene is more impressive. Never having seen the Tomb, 1 I must depict it from books,—by no means an easy task. Most of the historians are silent after describing the inner walls of the Hujrah. Al-Kalkashandi declares in sepulchra Apostoli,A bubecy et O modumconclavis fere usque ad tec nigra obligatur. This author, then, agrees with my Persian friends, who declare the sepulchre to be a marble slab. Ibn Jubayr, who travelled in a.h. 580, relates that the Apostle's coffin is a box of ebony (abnus) covered with sandal-wood, and plated with silver ; it is placed, he says, behind a curtain, and surrounded by an iron grating. Al-Samanhudi, 1 quoted by Burckhardt, declares that the curtain covers a square building of black stones, in the interior of which are the tombs of Mohammed and of his two immediate successors. He adds that the tombs are 1 And I might add, never having seen one who has seen it. Nie- buhr is utterly incorrect in his hearsay description of it. It is not ' enclosed within iron railings for fear lest the people might surreptit iously offer worship to the ashes of the Prophet.' The tomb is not 'of plain mason-work in the form of a chest,' nor does any one be lieve that it is 'placed within or between two other tombs, in which rest the ashes of the first two Caliphs.' The traveller appears to have lent a credulous ear to the eminent Arab merchant, who told him that a guard was placed over the tomb to prevent the populace scraping dirt from about it, and preserving it as a relic. 2 Burckhardt writes this author's name El Samhoudy, and in this he is followed by all our popular book-makers. Moslems have three ways of spelling it: 1. Al-Samhudi, 2. Al-Samahnudi, and 3. Al-Samanhudi. I prefer the latter, believing that the learned Shaykh, Nur al-Din Ali bin Abdullah al-Hasini (or Al-Husayni) was origin ally from Samanhud in Egypt, the ancient Sebennitis. He died in a.h. 911, and was buried in the Bakia cemetery.324 Pilgrimage to deep holes; and that the coffin which contains the Apostle is cased with silver, and has on the top a marble slab inscribed 'Bismillah! Allahummasalli alayh!' ('Inthe name of Allah! Allah have Mercy upon Him 1 !') The Apostle's body, it should be remembered, lies, or is supposed to lie, stretched at full length on the right side, with the right palm supporting the right cheek, the face fronting Meccah, as Moslems are always buried, and consequently the body lies with the head almost due West and the feet due East. Close behind him is placed AbuBakr, whose face fronts the Apostle's shoulder 2 ; and, lastly, Omar holds the same position with respect to his • » y 1 predecessor. q I;jt The places they are usually supposed d 1 P to occupy, then, would be thus disposed. dip But Moslem historians are not agreed i even upon so simple a point as this. C&gt;r&gt;ai» ■■ ■ &lt;»■ , ^■ i , , , , , ' - 1 Burckhardt, however, must be in error when he says 'The tombs are also covered with precious stuffs, and in the shape of cata falques, like that of Ibrahim in the great Mosque of Meccah. ,, The eunuchs positively declare that no one ever approaches the tomb, and that he who ventured to do so would at once be blinded by the super natural light. Moreover the historians of Al-Madinah all quote tales of certain visions of the Apostle, directing his tomb to be cleared of dust that had fallen upon it from above, in which case some man cele brated for piety and purity was let through a hole in the roof, by cords, down to the tomb, with directions to wipe it with his beard. This style of ingress is explained by another assertion of Al-Samanhudi, quoted by Burckhardt. 11 In a.h. 892, when Kaid-Bey rebuilt the Mosque, which had been destroyed by lightning, three deep graves were found in the inside, full of rubbish, but the author of this his tory, who himself entered it, saw no traces of tombs. The original place of Mohammed's tomb was ascertained with great difficulty ; the walls of the Hujrah were then rebuilt, and the iron railing placed round it, which is now there.'* 2 Upon this point authors greatly disagree. Ibn Jubayr, for in- 'stance, says that Abu Bakr's head is opposite the Apostle's feet, and that Omar's face is on a level with Abu Bakr's shoulder.XVI.— A Visit to the PropTomh. 325 C Many prefer this position, in line j 1 —some thus, in 1 I r —1 CZ3 , . i 1 unicorn r 1 —and others the right angle. 1 r-— 1 It is popularly asserted that in the Hujrah there is now spare place for only a single grave, reserved for Isa bin Maryam after his second coming. The historians of Al-Islam are full of tales proving that though many of their earlier saints, as Osman the Caliph and Hasan the Imam, were desirous of being buried there; and that although Ayishah, to whom the room belonged, willingly acceded to their wishes, son of man has as yet been unable to occupy it. After the Fatihah pronounced at Omar's tomb, and the short inspection of the Hujrah, Shaykh Hamid led me round the south-east corner of the baldaquin. 2 Turning 1 The vulgar story of the suspended coffin has been explained in two ways. Niebuhr supposes it to have arisen from the rude drawings sold to strangers. Mr. William Bankes (Giovanni Finati, vol. ii., p. 289) believes that the mass of rock popularly described as hanging unsupported in the Mosque of Omar at Jerusalem was con founded by Christians, who could not have seen either of these Moslem shrines, with the Apostle's Tomb at Al-Madinah. 2 Some Moslems end their Ziyarat at the Apostle's Tomb; others, instead of advancing, as I did, return to the Apostle's window, pray, and beg pardon for their parents and themselves, and ask all they de sire, concluding with prayers to the Almighty. Thence they repair to the Rauzah or Garden, and standing at the column called after Abu Lubabah, pray a two-bow prayer there ; concluding with the ' Dua,' or benediction upon the Apostle, and there repeat these words: 'O Allah, Thou hast said, and Thy word is true, ' Say, O Lord, pardon and show Mercy ; for Thou art the best of the Merciful,' (chap. 23). O God, verily we have heard Thy Word, and we come for Intercession to Thy Apostle from our own Sins, repenting our Errors, and confessing our Shortcomings and Transgressions! O Allah, pity us, and by the Dignity of Thy Apostle raise our Place, (in the Heavenly Kingdom)! O Allah, pardon our Brothers who have preceded us in the Faith! ' Then the Zair prays for himself, and his parents, and for those he loves. He should repeat, ' Allah have mercy upon326 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah towards the north, we stopped at what is commonly called the MahbatJibrail (' Place of the Archangel Gabriel's Descent with the Heavenly Revelations'), or simply Al-Malaikah—the Angels. It is a small window in the Eastern wall of the Mosque; we turned our backs upon it, and fronting the Hujrah, recited the following prayer:— 'Peace be upon You, O Angels of Allah, the Mukar- rabin (cherubs), and the Musharrifin (seraphs), the pure, the holy, honored by the Dwellers in Heaven, and by those who abide upon the Earth. O beneficent Lord! O Long-suffering! O Almighty! O Pitier! O thou Com passionate One! perfect our Light, and pardon our Sins, and accept Penitence for our Offences, and cause us to die among the Holy! Peace be upon Ye, Angels of the Merciful, one and all! And the Mercy of God and His Blessings be upon You!' After which I was shown the spot in the Hujrah where Sayyidna Isa shall be buried 1 by Mohammed's side. Thee, O Apostle of Allah ! ' seventy times, when an angel will reply, 'Allah bless thee, O thou blesser.' Then he should sit before the Pulpit, and mentally conceive in it the Apostle surrounded by the Fugitives and the Auxiliaries. Some place the right hand upon the pulpit, even as Mohammed used to do. The Zair then returns to the column of Abu Lubabah, and repents his sins there. Secondly, he stands in prayer at Ali's Pillar in front of the form. And, lastly, he repairs to the Ustuwanat al-Ashab (the Companions' Column) the fourth distant from the Pulpit on the right, and the third from the Hujrah on the left; here he prays and meditates, and blesses Allah and the Apostle. After which, he proceeds to visit the rest of the holy places. 1 It is almost unnecessary to inform the reader that all Moslems deny the personal suffering of Christ, cleaving to the heresy of the Christian Docetes,—certain ' beasts in the shape of men,' as they are called in the Epistles of Ignatius to the Smyrneans,—who believed that a phantom was crucified in our Saviour's place. They also hold to the second coming of the Lord in the flesh, as a forerunner to Mohammed, who shall reappear shortly before the day of judgment. Bartema (Appendix 2) relates a story concerning the Saviour's future tomb. fXVI. — A Visit to th Tomb. 327 Then turning towards the West, at a point where there is a break in the symmetry of the Hujrah, we arrived at the sixth station, the sepulchre or cenotaph of the Lady Fatimah. Her grave is outside the enceinte and the curtain which surrounds her father's remains; so strict is Moslem decorum, and so exalted its opinion of the 'Virgin's' 1 delicacy. The Eastern side of the Hujrah, here turning a little Westward, interrupts the shape of the square, in order to give this spot the appearance of dis connection with the rest of the building. The tomb, seen through a square aperture like those above described, is a long catafalque, covered with a black pall. Though there is great doubt whether the Lady be not buried with her son Hassan in the Bakia cemetery, this place is always visited by the pious Moslem. The following is the prayer opposite the grave of the amiable Fatimah:— ' Peace be upon Thee, Daughter of the Apostle of Allah! Peace be upon Thee, Daughter of the Prophet of Allah ! Peace be upon Thee, thou Daughter of Mustafa! Peace be upon Thee, thou Mother of the Shurafa! 2 (seed of Mohammed.) Peace be upon Thee, O Lady amongst Women! Peace be upon Thee, O fifth of the Ahl al-Kisa 8 Peace be upon Thee, O Zahra and Batul! 4 (Pure and Vir- 1 This epithet will be explained below. The reader must bear in mind, that this part of the Harim was formerly the house of Ali and Fatimah; it was separated from the Hujrah—the abode of Moham med and Ayishah—only by a narrow brick wall, with a window in it, which was never shut. Omar Bin Abd al-Aziz enclosed it in the mosque, by order of Al-Walid, a.h. 90. 2 Plural of Sharif, a descendant of Mohammed. 3 The ' people of the garment,' so called, because on one occasion the Apostle wrapped his cloak around himself, his daughter, his son- in-law, and his two grandsons, thereby separating them in dignity from other Moslems. 4 Burckhardt translates 'Zahra' 'bright blooming Fatimah.' This I believe to be the literal meaning of the epithet. When thus applied, however, it denotes 'virginem to Kara/xrivia nescientem,'328 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah Meccah. gin).

We then broke away as we best could from the | crowd of female 'askers,' who have established their Lares and Penates under the shadow of the Lady's wing 5 ' and, advancing a few paces, we fronted to the North, and recited a prayer in honour of Hamzah, and of the martyrs ' who lie buried at the foot of Mount Ohod. 2 We then turned to the right, and, fronting the Easterly wall, prayed | for the souls of the blessed whose mortal spirits repose within Al-Bakia's hallowed circuit. 3 After this we returned to the Southern wall of the Mosque, and, facing towards Meccah, we recited the following supplication:—'O Allah!

Lastly, we returned to the Garden, 8 and prayed another two-bow prayer, ending, as we began, with the worship of the Creator. - ^ 1 The Ya Sin (Y, S), the 36th chapter of the Koran, frequently recited by those whose profession it is to say such masses for the j benefit of living, as well as of dead, sinners. Most educated Mos lems commit it to memory. 2 Or more correctly, 14 There is no Ilah but Allah,' that is, 14 There is no god but the God.' 3 Some Zairs, after praying at the Caliph Osman's niche, leave the Mosque, especially when the ' Jama'at,' or public worship, is not being performed in the Rauzah. Others, as we did, pray alone in the Garden, and many authors prefer this conclusion to Visitation, for the reason above given.XVI.— A Visit to Tomh. 331 Unfortunately for me, the boy Mohammed had donned that grand embroidered coat. At the end of the ceremony the Aghas, or eunuchs of the Mosque, a race of men con sidered respectable by their office, and prone to make themselves respected by the freest administration of club- law, assembled in Al-Rauzah to offer me the congratulation Ziyaratak Mubarak —' Blessed be thy Visitation,'—and to demand fees. Then came the Sakka, or water-carrier of the Mosque well, Zemzem, 1 offering a tinned saucer filled from the holy source. And lastly I was beset by beggars. Some were mild beggars and picturesque, who sat upon the ground immersed in the contemplation of their napkins; others, angry beggars who cursed if they were not gratified; and others noisy and petulant beggars, especially the feminine party near the Lady's tomb, who captured me by the skirt of my garment, compelling me to ransom myself. There were, besides, pretty beggars, boys who held out the right hand on the score of good looks ; ugly beggars, emaciated rascals whose long hair, dirt, and leanness entitled them to charity; and lastly, the blind, the halt, and the diseased, who, as Sons of the Holy City, demanded from the Faithful that support with which they could not provide them selves. Having been compelled by my companions, highly against my inclination, to become a man of rank, I was obliged to pay in proportion, and my almoner in the handsome coat, as usual, took a kind of pride in being profuse. This first visit cost me double what I had intended—four dollars—nearly one pound sterling, and never afterwards could I pay less than half that sum. 2 1 This has become a generic name for a Well situated within the walls of a Mosque. 2 As might be expected, the more a man pays, the higher he estimates his own dignity. Some Indians have spent as much as 500 dollars during a first visit. Others have 'made Maulids,' 1 i. e., feasted all the poor connected with the temple with rice, meat,332 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Having now performed all the duties of a good Zair, I was permitted by Shaykh Hamid to wander about and see the sights. We began our circumam- bulation at the Bab al-Salam, 1 the Gate of Salvation, the South-Western entrance pierced in the long wall of the Mosque. It is a fine archway handsomely encrusted with marble and glazed tiles ; the many gilt inscriptions on its sides give it, especially at night-time, an appearance of considerable splendour. The portcullis like doors are of wood, strengthened with brass plates, and nails of the same metal. Outside this gate is a little Sabil, or public fountain, where those who will not pay for the water, kept ready in large earthen jars by the 'Sakka' of the Mosque, perform their ablutions gratis. Here all the mendicants congregate in force, sitting on the outer steps and at the entrance of the Mosque, up and through which the visitors must pass. About the centre of the Western wall is the Bab al- Rahmah, the Gate of Pity, which admits the dead bodies of the Faithful when carried to be prayed over in the Mosque. There is nothing remarkable in its appear ance ; in common with the other gates it has huge folding doors, iron-bound, an external flight of steps, and a few modern inscriptions. The Bab Majidi, or Gate of the Sultan Abd al-Majid, stands in the centre of the Northern wall; like its portico, it is unfinished, but its present appearance promises that it will eclipse all except the Bab al-Salam. The Bab al-Nisa, or Gate of Women, is in the Eastern wall opposite the Bab al-Rahmah, with which it is connected by the 'Farsh al-Hajar,' a broad band of stone, two or three steps below the level of the portico, &amp;c., whilst others brought rare and expensive presents for the officials. Such generosity, however, is becoming rare in these un worthy days. i This gate was anciently called the Bab al-Atakah, 'of Deliver ance.'XVI. — A Visit to Vomb. 333 and slightly raised above the Sahn or the hypaethral por tion of the Mosque. And lastly, in the Southern portion of the same Eastern wall is the Bab Jibrail, the Gate of the Archangel Gabriel. 1 All these entrances are arrived at by short external flights of steps leading from the streets, as the base of the temple, unlike that of Meccah, is a little higher than the foundation of the buildings around it. The doors are closed by the attendant eunuchs immediately after the night prayers, except during the blessed month Al- Ramazan and in the pilgrimage season, when pious visitors pay considerable fees there to pass the night in meditation and prayer. The minarets are five in number ; but one, the Shikayliyah, at the North-West angle of the building, has been levelled, and is still in process of being rebuilt. The Munar Bab al-Salam stands by the gate of that name : it is a tall, handsome tower, surmounted by a large ball or cone 2 of brass gilt or burnished. The Munar Bab al- Rahmah, about the centre of the Western wall, is of more simple form than the others: it has two galleries, with the superior portion circular, and surmounted by the conical 'extinguisher'-roof so common in Turkey and Egypt. On the North-East angle of the Mosque stands the Sulaymaniyah Munar, so named after its founder, Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent. It is a well-built and substantial stone-tower divided into three stages; the two 1 Most of these entrances have been named and renamed. The Bab Jibrail, for instance, which derives its present appellation from the general belief that the archangel once passed through it, is generally called in books Bab al-Jabr, the Gate of Repairing (the broken fortunes of a friend or follower). It must not be confounded with the Mahbat Jibrail, or the window near it in the Eastern wall, where the archangel usually descended from heaven with the Wahy or Inspiration. 2 By some wonderful process the ' Printer's Devil ' converted, in the first edition, this ' ball or cone' into 4 'bull or cow.'334 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Mcccah. lower portions are polygonal, the upper cylindrical, and each terminates in a platform with a railed gallery carried all round for the protection of those who ascend. And lastly, from the South-East angle of the Mosque, supposed to be upon the spot where Belal, the Apostle's loud-lunged crier, called the first Moslems to prayer, 1 springs the Munar Raisiyah, so called because it is ap propriated to the Ruasa or chiefs of the Mu'ezzins. Like the Sulaymaniyah, it consists of three parts : the first and second stages are polygonal; and the third, a cylinder, is furnished like the lower two with a railed gallery. Both the latter minarets end in solid ovals of masonry, from which project a number of wooden triangles. To these and to the galleries on all festive occasions, such as the arrival of the Damascus caravan, are hung oil-lamps—a poor attempt at illumination, which may rationally explain the origin of the Madinite superstition concerning the column of light which crowns the Prophet's tomb. There is no uniformity in the shape or the size of these four minarets, and at first sight, despite their beauty and grandeur, they appear somewhat and misplaced. But after a few days I found that my eye grew accustomed to them, and I had no difficulty in appreciating their massive proportions and lofty forms. Equally irregular are the Riwaks, or porches, sur rounding the hypaethral court. Along the Northern wall there will be, when finished, a fine colonnade of granite, paved with marble. The Eastern Riwak has three rows of pillars, the Western four, and the Southern, under which stands the tomb, of course has its columns ranged deeper than all the others. These supports of the building are of different material; some of fine marble, others of i Belal, the loud-lunged crier, stood, we are informed, by Moslem historians, upon a part of the roof on one of the walls of the Mosque. The minaret, as the next chapter will show, was the invention of a more tasteful age.XVI.— A Visit totlie Prophefs 335 rough stone, plastered over and painted with the most vulgar of arabesques,—vermilion and black in irregular patches and broad streaks, like the stage-face of a London clown. 1 Their size, moreover, is different, the Southern colonnade being composed of pillars palpably larger than those in the other parts of the Mosque. Scarcely any two shafts own similar capitals; many have no pedestal, and some of them are cut with a painful ignorance of art. I cannot extend my admiration of the minarets to the columns—in their ' architectural lawlessness ' there is not a redeeming point. Of these unpraisable pillars three are celebrated in the annals of Al-Islam, for which reason their names are painted upon them, and five others enjoy the honour of distinctive appellations. The first is called Al-Mukhallak, because, on some occasion of impurity, it was anointed with a perfume called Khaluk. It is near the Mihrab al- Nabawi, on the right of the place where the Imam prays; and it notes the spot where, before the invention of the Pulpit, the Apostle, leaning upon the Ustuwanat al-Han- nanah—the Weeping Pillar 2 —used to recite the Khutbah or Friday sermon. The second stands third from the Pulpit, and third from the Hujrah. It is called the Pillar of Ayishah, also the Ustuwanat al-Kurah, or the Column of Lots, because the Apostle, according to the testimony of his favourite wife, declared that if men knew the value of the place, they would cast lots to pray there: in some books it is known as the Pillar of the Muhajirin or Fugitives, and others mention it as Al-Mukhallak—the Perfumed. Twenty cubits distant from Ayishah's Pillar, and the 1 This abomination may be seen in Egypt on many of the tombs, —those outside the Bal al-Nasr at Cairo, for instance. 2 The tale of this Weeping Pillar is well known. Some suppose it to have been buried beneath the pulpit: others—they are few in number—declare that it was inserted in the body of the pulpit.336 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. second from the Hujrah, and the fourth from the Pulpit, is the Pillar of Repentance, or of Abu Lubabah. It derives its name from the following circumstance. Abu Lubabah was a native of Al-Madinah, one of the Auxili aries and a companion of Mohammed, originally it is said a Jew, according to others of the Beni Amr bin Auf of the Aus tribe. Being sent for by his kinsmen or his allies, the Benu Kurayzah, at that time capitulating to ; Mohammed, he was consulted by the distracted men, women, and children, who threw themselves at his feet, ' and begged of him to intercede for them with the offended Apostle. Abu Lubabah swore he would do so: at the same time, he drew his hand across his throat, as much as to say, ' Defend yourselves to the last, for if you yield, 1 such is your doom.' Afterwards repenting, he bound himself with a huge chain to the date-tree in whose place the column now stands, vowing to continue there until Allah and the Apostle accepted his penitence—a circum stance which did not take place till the tenth day, when his hearing was gone and he had almost lost his sight. The less celebrated pillars are the Ustuwanat al- Sarir, or Column of the Cot, where the Apostle was wont to sit meditating on his humble couch-frame of date- sticks. The Ustuwanat Ali notes the spot where the fourth Caliph used to pray and watch near his father-in- law at night. At the Ustuwanat al-Wufud, as its name denotes, the Apostle received envoys, couriers, and emissaries from foreign places. The Ustuwanat al- Tahajjud now stands where Mohammed, sitting upon his mat, passed the night in prayer. And lastly is the Makam Jibrail (Gabriel's place), for whose other name, Mirbaat al-Bair, ' the Pole of the Beast of Burden,' I have been unable to find an explanation. The four Riwaks, or porches, of the Madinah Mosque open upon a hypsethral court of parallelogramic shape.XVI. — A Visit to 337 The only remarkable object in it 1 is a square of wooden railing enclosing a place full of well-watered earth, called the Garden of our Lady Fatimah. 2 It now contains a dozen date-trees—in Ibn Jubayr's time there were fifteen. Their fruit is sent by the eunuchs as presents to the Sultan and the great men of Al-Islam; it is highly valued by the vulgar, but the Olema do not think much of its claims to importance. Among the palms are the vener able remains of a Sidr, or Lote tree, 3 whose produce is sold for inordinate sums. The enclosure is entered by a dwarf gate in the South-Eastern portion of the railing, near the well, and one of the eunuchs is generally to be seen in it: it is under the charge of the Mudir, or chief treasurer. These gardens are not un common in Mosques, as the traveller who passes through Cairo can convince himself. They form a pretty and an appropriate feature in a building erected for the worship of Him 'Who spread the Earth with Carpets of Flowers and drew shady Trees from the dead Ground.' A tradi tion of the Apostle also declares that 'Acceptable is Devotion in the Garden and in the Orchard.' 1 The little domed building which figures in the native sketches, and in all our prints of the Al-Madinah Mosque, was taken down three or four years ago. It occupied part of the centre of the square, and was called Kubbat al-Zayt—Dome of Oil; or Kubbat al-Shama— Dome of Candles,—from its use as a store-room for lamps and wax candles. 2 This is its name among the illiterate, who firmly believe the palms to be descendants of trees planted there by the hands of the Prophet's daughter. As far as I could discover, the tradition has no foundation, and in old times there was no garden in the hypaethral court. The vulgar are in the habit of eating a certain kind of date, 'Al-Sayhani,' in the Mosque, and of throwing the stones about; this practice is violently denounced by the Olema. 3 Rhamnus Nabeca, Forsk. The fruit, called Nabak, is eaten, and the leaves are used for the purpose of washing dead bodies. The visitor is not forbidden to take fruit or water as presents from Al- Madinah, but it is unlawful for him to carry away earth, or stones, or cakes of dust, made for sale to the ignorant. VOL. I. 2233$ Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah At the South-East angle of this enclosure, under a wooden roof supported by pillars of the same material, stands the Zemzem, generally called the Bir al-Nabi, or 'the Apostle's well.' My predecessor declares that the brackishness of its produce has stood in the way of its reputation for holiness. Yet a well-educated man told me that it was as 'light' (wholesome) water 1 as any in Al-Madinah,—a fact which he accounted for by sup posing a subterraneous passage 2 which connects it with the great Zemzem at Meccah. Others, again, believe that it is filled by a vein of water springing directly under the Apostle's grave ; generally, however, among the learned it is not more revered than our Lady's Garden, nor is it ranked in books among the holy wells of Al-Madinah. Between this Zemzem well and the Eastern Riwak is the Stoa, or Academia, of the Prophet's city. In the cool mornings and evenings the ground is strewed with pro fessors, who teach the young idea, as an eminent orientalist hath it, to shout rather than to shoot. 8 A few feet to the South of the palm garden is a moveable wooden planking painted green, and about three feet high ; it serves to separate the congregation from the Imam when he prays here ; and at the North-Eastern angle of the enclosure is a 1 The Arabs, who, like all Orientals, are exceedingly curious about water, take the trouble to weigh the produce of their wells; the lighter the water, the more digestible and wholesome it is considered. 2 The common phenomenon of rivers flowing underground in Arabia has, doubtless, suggested to the people these subterraneous passages, with which they connect the most distant places. At Al- Madinah, amongst other tales of short cuts known only to certain Badawi families, a man told me of a shaft leading from his native city to Hazramaut: according to him, it existed in the times of the Prophet, and was a journey of only three days! 3 The Mosque Library is kept in large chests near the Bab al- Salam; the only MS. of any value here is a Koran written in the Sulsi hand. It is nearly four feet long, bound in a wooden cover, and padlocked, so as to require from the curious a ' silver key.'XVI.— A Visit to 339 Shajar Kanadil, a large brass chandelier, which completes the furniture of the court. After this inspection, the shadows of evening began to gather round us. We left the Mosque, reverently taking care to issue forth with the left foot, and not to back out of it as is the Sunnat or practice derived from the Apostle, when taking leave of the Meccan Temple. To conclude this long chapter. Although every Mos lem, learned and simple, firmly believes that Mohammed's remains are interred in the Hujrah at Al-Madinah, I cannot help suspecting that the place is doubtful as that of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. It must be remembered that a tumult followed the announcement of the Apostle's death, when the people, as often happens, believing him to be immortal, 1 refused to credit the report, and even Omar threatened destruction to any one that asserted it. Moreover the body was scarcely cold when the contest about the succession arose between the fugitives of Meccah and the auxiliaries of Al-Madinah : in the ardour of which, according to the Shi'ahs, the house of Aliand Fatimah— within a few feet of the spot where the tomb of the Apostle is now placed—was threatened with fire, and Abu Bakr was elected Caliph that same evening. If anyone find cause to wonder that the last resting-place of a personage so important was not fixed for ever, he may find many a parallel case in Al-Madinah. To quote no other, three several localities claim the honour of containing the Lady Fatimah's mortal spoils, although one might suppose that the daughter of the Apostle and the mother of the Imams would not be laid in an unknown grave. My reasons for incredulity are the following ; 1 So the peasants in Brittany believe that Napoleon the First is not yet dead; the Prussians expect Frederick the Second; the Swiss, William Tell; the older English, King Arthur; and certain modem fanatics look forward to the re-appearance of Joanna Southcote. Why multiply instances in so well known a branch of the history of popular superstitions ?340 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. From the earliest days the shape of the Apostle's tomb has never been generally known in Al-Islam, For this reason it is that graves are made convex in some countries, and flat in others. Had there been a Sunnat, 1 such would not have been the case. The accounts of the learned are discrepant. Al- Samanhudi, perhaps the highest authority, contradicts himself. In one place he describes the coffin ; in another he expressly declares that he entered the Hujrah when it was being repaired by Kaid-Bey, and saw in the inside three deep graves, but no traces of tombs. 2 Either, then, the mortal remains of the Apostle had, despite Moslem superstition, 8 mingled with the dust, (a probable circum- 1 The Sunnat is the custom or practice of the Apostle, rigidly conformed to by every good and orthodox Moslem. 2 The reader will bear in mind that I am quoting from Burck- hardt. When in Al-Hijaz and at Cairo, I vainly endeavoured to buy a copy of Al-Samanhudi. One was shown to me at Al-Madinah; unhappily, it bore the word Wakf (bequeathed), and belonged to the Mosque. I was scarcely allowed time to read it. (See p. 102, ante.) 3 In Moslem law, prophets, martyrs, and saints, are not supposed to be dead; their property, therefore, remains their own. The Olema have confounded themselves in the consideration of the prophetic state after death. Many declare that prophets live and pray for forty days in the tomb; at the expiration of which time, they are taken to the presence of their Maker, where they remain till the blast of Israfil's trumpet. The common belief, however, leaves the bodies in the graves, but no one would dare to assert that the holy ones are suffered to undergo corruption. On the contrary, their faces are blooming, their eyes bright, and blood would issue from their bodies if wounded. Al-Islam, as will afterwards appear, abounds in traditions of the ancient tombs of saints and martyrs, when accidentally opened, exposing to view corpses apparently freshly buried. And it has come to pass that this fact, the result of sanctity, has now become an unerring indication of it. A remarkable case in point is that of the late Sharif Ghalib, the father of the present Prince of Meccah. In his lifetime he was reviled as a wicked tyrant. But some years after his death, his body was found unde- composed ; he then became a saint, and men now pray at his tomb Perhaps his tyranny was no drawback to his holy reputation. LaXVI.— A Visit to the stance after nearly nine hundred years' interment), or, what is more likely, they had been removed by the Shi'ah schis matics who for centuries had charge of the sepulchre. 1 And lastly, I cannot but look upon the tale of the blinding light which surrounds the Apostle's tomb, current for ages past and still universally believed upon the authority of the attendant eunuchs, who must know its falsehood, as a priestly gloss intended to conceal a defect. I here conclude the subject, committing it to some future and more favoured investigator. In offering the above remarks, I am far from wishing to throw a doubt upon an established point of history. But where a sus picion of fable arises from popular ' facts,' a knowledge of man and of his manners teaches us to regard it with favouring eye. 2 Brinvilliers was declared after execution, by her confessor and the people generally, a saint;—simply, I presume, because of the enormity of her crimes. 1 Note to Third Edition.—I have lately been assured by- Mo hammed al-Halabi, Shaykh al-Olema of Damascus, that he was per mitted by the Aghawat to pass through the gold-plated door leading into the Hujrah, and that he saw no trace of a sepulchre. 2 I was careful to make a ground-plan of the Prophet's Mosque, as Burckhardt was prevented by severe illness from so doing. It will give the reader a fair idea of the main point, though, in certain minor details, it is not to be trusted. Some of my papers and sketches, which by precaution I had placed among my medicines, after cutting them into squares, numbering them, and rolling them care fully up, were damaged by the breaking of a bottle. The plan of Al-Madinah is slightly altered from Burckhardt's. Nothing can be more ludicrous than the views of the Holy City, as printed in our popular works. They are of the style ^ bird's-eye, 0 and present a curious perspective. They despise distance like the Chinese,— pictorially audacious; the Harrah, or ridge in the foreground appears to be 200 yards, instead of three or four miles, distant from the town. They strip the place of its suburb Al-Manakhah, in order to show the enceinte, omit the fort, and the gardens north and south of the city, enlarge the Mosque twenty-fold for dignity, and make it occupy the whole centre of the city, instead of a small corner in the south-342 Pilgrimage to Al-Madin Meccah. east quarter. They place, for symmetry, towers only at the angles of the walls, instead of all along the curtain, and gather up and press into the same field all the venerable and interesting features of the country, those behind the artist's back, and at his sides, as well as what appears in front. Such are the Turkish lithographs. At Meccah, some Indians support themselves by depicting the holy shrines ; their works are a truly Oriental mixture of ground plan and elevation, drawn with pen and ink, and brightened with the most vivid colours—grotesque enough, but less unintelligible than the more ambitious imitations of European art.CHAPTER XVII. an essay towards the history of the prophet's mosque. I bn A bbas has informed the world that when the eighty individuals composing Noah's family issued from the ark, they settled at a place distant ten marches and twelve parasangs 1 (thirty-six to forty-eight miles) from Babel or Babylon. There they increased and multiplied, and spread into a mighty empire. At length under the rule of Namrud (Nimrod), son of Kanaan (Canaan), son of Ham, they lapsed from the worship of the true God : a miracle dispersed them into distant parts of the earth, and they were further broken up by the one primaeval language being divided into seventy-two dialects. A tribe called Aulad Sam bin Nuh (the children of Shem), or Amalikah and Amalik, 2 from their ancestor Amlak bin Arfakhshad bin Sam bin Nuh, was inspired 1 In Oriental geography the parasang still, as in the days of Pliny, greatly varies, from 1500 to 6000 yards. Captain Francklin, whose opinion is generally taken, makes it (in his Tour to Persia) a measure of about four miles (Preface to Ibn Haukal, by Sir Gore Ouseley). 2 M. C. de Perceval [Essui suv VHistoivc des Avabcs avant rislum- isme), makes Amlak son of Laoud (Lud), son of Shem, or, according to others, son of Ham. That learned writer identifies the Amalik with the Phoenicians, the Amalekites, the Canaanites, and the Hyksos. He alludes, also, to an ancient tradition which makes them to have colonised Barbary in Africa.344 Pilgrimage toAl-M adinah with a knowledge of the Arabic tongue 1 : it settled at Al- Madinah, and was the first to cultivate the ground and to plant palm-trees. In course of time these people ex tended over the whole tract between the seas of Al-Hijaz (the Red Sea) and Al-Oman, (north-western part of the Indian Ocean), and they became the progenitors of the Jababirah 2 (tyrants or ' giants ') of Syria, as well as the Farainah (Pharaohs) of Egypt. 8 Under these Amalik such 1 The Dabistan al-Mazahib relates a tradition that the Almighty, when addressing the angels in command, uses the Arabic tongue, but when speaking in mercy or beneficence, the Deri dialect of Persian. 2 These were the giants who fought against Israel in Palestine. 3 In this wild tradition we find a confirmation of the sound geographical opinion which makes Arabia ^ Une des pepinieres du genre humain ' (M. Jomard). It must be remembered that the theatre of all earliest civilisation has been a fertile valley with a navigable stream, like Sind, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. The ex istence of such a spot in Arabia would have altered every page of her history; she would then have become a centre, not a source, of civilisation. Strabo's Malothes river in Al-Yaman is therefore a myth. As it is, the immense population of the peninsula—still thick, even in the deserts—has, from the earliest ages, been impelled by drought, famine, or desire of conquest, to emigrate into happier regions. All history mentions two main streams which took their rise in the wilds. The first set to the North-East, through Persia, Mekran, Baluchistan, Sind, and the Afghan Mountains, as far as Samarkand, Bokhara, and Tibet; the other, flowing towards the North-West, passed through Egypt and Barbary into Etruria, Spain, the Isles of the Mediterranean, and Southern France. There are two minor emigra tions chronicled in history, and written in the indelible characters of physiognomy and philology. One of these set in an exiguous but perennial stream towards India, especially Malabar, where, mixing with the people of the country, the Arab merchants became the pro genitors of the Moplah race. The other was a partial emigration, also for commercial purposes, to the coast of Berberah, in Eastern Africa, where, mixing with the Galla tribes, the people of Hazramaut became the sires of the extensive Somali and Sawahil nations. Thus we have from Arabia four different lines of emigration, tending N.E. and S.E., N.W. and S.W. At some future time I hope to develop this curious but somewhat obscure portion of Arabian history. It bears upon a most interesting subject, and serves to ex plain, by the consanguinity of races, the marvellous celerity with» XVII.— History of th 345 was the age of man that during the space of four hundred years a bier would not be seen, nor ' keening ' be heard, in their cities. The last king of the Amalik, 'Arkam bin al-Arkam, 1 ' was, according to most authors, slain by an army of the children of Israel sent by Moses after the Exodus, 2 with orders thoroughly to purge Meccah and Al-Madinah of their Infidel inhabitants. All the tribe was destroyed, with the exception of the women, the children, and a youth of the royal family, whose extraordinary beauty persuaded the invaders to spare him pending a reference to the Prophet. When the army returned, they found that Moses had died during the expedition, and they were re ceived with reproaches by the people for having violated his express command. The soldiers, unwilling to live with their own nation under this reproach, returned to Al- Hijaz, and settled there. Moslem authors are agreed that after the Amalik the Benu Israel ruled in the Holy Land of Arabia, but the learned in history are not agreed upon the cause of their emigration. According to some, when Moses was re turning from a pilgrimage to Meccah, a multitude of his followers, seeing in Al-Madinah the signs of the city which, according to the Taurat, or Pentateuch, should hear the preaching of the last Prophet, settled there, and were joined by many Badawin of the neighbourhood who which the faith of Al-Islam spread from the Pillars of Hercules to the confines of China—embracing part of Southern Europe, the whole of Northern and a portion of Central Africa, and at least three-fourths of the continent of Asia. 1 Of this name M. C. de Perceval remarks, Le mot Arcam etait une designation commune a tous ces rois.' He identifies it with Rekem (Numbers xxxi. 8), one of the kings of the Midianites; and recognises in the preservation of the royal youth the history of Agag and Samuel, 2 And some most ignorantly add, ' after the entrance of Moses into the Promised Land.'Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. conformed to the law of Moses. Ibn Shaybab also informs us that when Moses and Aaron were wending; northwards from Meccah, they, being in fear of certain Jews settled at Al-Madinah, did not enter the city, 3 but pitched their tents on Mount Ohod. Aaron being about to die, Moses dug his tomb, and said, ' Brother, thine hour is come! turn thy face to the next world!' Aaron entered the grave, lay at full length, and immediately expired; upon which the Jewish lawgiver covered him with earth, and went his way towards the Promised Land. 3 Abu Hurayrah asserted that the Benu Israel, after long searching, settled in Al-Madinah, because, when driven from Palestine by the invasion of Bukht al-Nasr (Nebuchadnezzar), they found in their books that the last Prophet would manifest himself in a town of the towns of Arabiyah, 3 called Zat Nakhl, or the ' Place of Palm trees.' Some of the sons of Aaron occupied the city; other tribes settled at Khaybar, 4 and in the neigh- 1 In those days, we are told, the Jews, abandoning their original settlement in Al-Ghabbah or the low lands to the N. of the town, migrated to the highest portions of the Madinah plain on the S. and E., and the lands of the neighbourhood of the Kuba Mosque. 2 When describing Ohod, I shall have occasion to allude to Aaron's dome, which occupies the highest part. Few authorities, however, believe that Aaron was buried there, his grave, under 3, small stone cupola, is shown over the summit of Mount Hor, in tha Sinaitic Peninsula, and is much visited by devotees. 3 It must be remembered that many of the Moslem geographers derive the word ' Arabia ' from a tract of land in the neighbourhood of Al-Madinah. 4 Khaybar in Hebrew is supposed to signify a castle. D'Herbelot makes it to mean a pact or association of the Jews against the Moslems. This fort appears to be one of the latest as well as the earliest of the Hebrew settlements in Al-Hijaz. Benjamin of Tudela asserts that there were 50,000 Jews resident at their old colony, Bartema in a.d. 1703 found remnants of the people there, but his account of them is disfigured by fable. In Niebuhr's time the Beni Khaybar had mde-XVII.— History of th 347 bourhood, building ' Utum,' or square, flat-roofed, stone castles for habitation and defence. They left an order to their descendants that Mohammed should be favourably received, but Allah hardened their hearts unto their own destruction. Like asses they turned their backs upon Allah's mercy, 1 and the consequence is, that they have been rooted out of the land. The Tarikh Tabari declares that when Bukht al- Nasr, 2 after destroying Jerusalem, attacked and slew the king of Egypt, who had given an asylum to a remnant of the house of Israel, the persecuted fugitives made their way into Al-Hijaz, settled near Yasrib (Al-Madinah), where they founded several towns, Khaybar, Fadak, Wady al-Subu, Wady al-Kura, Kurayzah, and many others. It appears, then, by the concurrence of historians, that the Jews at an early time either colonised, or sup planted the Amalik at, Al-Madinah. At length the Israelites fell away from the worship of the one God, who raised up against them the Arab tribes of Aus and Khazraj, the progenitors of modern Ansar. Both these tribes claimed a kindred origin, and pendent Shaykhs, and were divided into three tribes, viz., the Benu Masad, the Benu Shahan, and the Benu Anizah (this latter, however, is a Moslem name), who were isolated and hated by the other Jews, and therefore the traveller supposes them to have been Karaites. In Burckhardt's day the race seems to have been entirely rooted out. I made many inquiries, and all assured me that there is not a single Jewish family now in Khaybar. It is indeed the popular boast in Al- Hijaz, that, with the exception of Jeddah (and perhaps Yambu', where the Prophet never set his foot), there is not a town in the country harbouring an Infidel. This has now become a point of fanatic honour ; but if history may be trusted, it has become so only lately. 1 When the Arabs see the ass turn tail to the wind and rain, they exclaim, 11 Lo ! he turneth his back upon the mercy of Allah !

The disgrace of such a scene afforded him a pretext for selling off^is property, and, followed by his thirteen sons,—all borne to him by his wife Tarikah,—and others of the tribe, Amru emigrated Northwards. The little party, thus preserved from the Yamanian Deluge, was destined by Allah to become the forefathers of the Auxiliaries of his chosen Apostle. All the children of Amru thus dispersed into different parts of Arabia. His eldest son, Salabah bin Amru, chose Al-Hijaz, settled at Al-Madinah, then in the hands of the impious Benu Israel, and became the father of the in Saba,m Aus and Khazraj. In course of time, the new comers were made by Allah an instrument of vengeance against the disobedient Jews. Of the latter people, the two tribes Kurayzah and Nazir claimed certain feudal rights (well known to Europe) upon all occasions of Arab marriages. The Aus and the Khazraj, after enduring this indignity fur a time, at length had recourse to one of their kinsmen who, when the family dispersed, had settled in Syria.

Some authors mention two different expeditions by dif ferent Tobbas; others only one, attributing it differently, however, to two Tobbas,—Abu Karb in the 3rd century of the Christian era, and Tobba al-Asghar, the last of that dynasty, who reigned, according to some, in a.d. 300, according to others in a.d. 448. M. C. de Perceval places the event about a. d. 206, and asserts that the Aus and Khazraj did not emigrate to Al-Madinah before a.d. 300. The word Tobba or Tubba, I have been informed by some of the modern Arabs, is still used in the Himyaritic dialect of Arabic to signify ' the Great' or •' the Chief.' 2 Nothing is more remarkable in the annals of the Arabs than their efforts to prove the Ishmaelitic descent of Mohammed; at the same time no historic question is more open to doubt. 3 If this be true it proves that the Jews of Al-Hijaz had in those days superstitious reverence for the Ka'abah; otherwise the Tobba, after conforming to the law of Moses, would not have shown it thisXVII.— History of th 351 for the expected Prophet, he returned to his capital in Al- Yaman, where he abolished idolatry by the ordeal of fire. He treated his priestly guests with particular attention, and on his death-bed he wrote the following tetrastich :— 11 1 testify of Ahmad that he of a truth Is a prophet from Allah, the Maker of souls.

Then sealing the paper he committed it to the charge of the High Priest, with a solemn injunction to deliver the letter, should an opportunity offer, into the hands of the great Prophet ; and that, if the day be distant, the missive should be handed down from generation to generation till it reached the person to whom it was addressed. The house founded by him at Al-Madinah was committed to a priest of whose descendants was Abu Ayyub the Ansari, the first person over whose threshold the Apostle passed when he ended the Flight. Abu Ayyub had also charge of the Tobba's letter, so that after three or four centuries, it arrived at its destination. Al-Madinah was ever well inclined to Mohammed. In 1 mark of respect. Moreover there is a legend that the same Rabbis dissuaded the Tobba from plundering the sacred place when he was treacherously advised so to do by the Benu Hudayl Arabs. I have lately perused 14 The Worship of Ba'alim in Israel,' based upon the work of Dr. R. Dozy, 11 The Israelites in Mecca.' By Dr. H. Oort. Trans lated from the Dutch, and enlarged, with Notes and Appendices, by the Right Rev. John William Colenso, D.D, (Longmans.) I see no reason why Meccah or Beccah should be made to mean ''A Slaugh ter'; why the Ka'abah should be founded by the Simeonites ; why the Hajj should be the Feast of Trumpets; and other assertions in which everything seems to be taken for granted except etymology, which is tortured into confession. If Meccah had been founded by the Simeonites, why did the Persians and the Hindus respect it ? i It is curious that Abdullah, Mohammed's father, died and was buried at Al-Madinah, and that his mother Aminah's tomb is at Abwa, on the Madinah road. Here, too, his great-grandfather Hashim married Salma Al-Mutadalliyah, before him espoused to Uhayhah, of the Aus tribe. Shaybah, generally called Abd al-Muttalib, the352 Pilgrintage to Al-Madinah the early part of his career, the emissaries of a tribe called the Benu Abd al-Ashhal came from that town to Meccah, in order to make a treaty with the Kuraysh, and the Apostle seized the opportunity of preaching Al-Islam to them. His words were seconded by Ayyas bin Ma'az, a youth of the tribe, and opposed by the chiefs of the embassy ; who, however, returned home without pledging themselves to either party. 1 Shortly afterwards a body of the Aus and the Khazraj came to the pilgrimage of Meccah : when Mohammed began preaching to them, they recognised the person so long expected by the Jews, and swore to him an oath which is called in Moslem history the ' First Fealty of the Steep. 2 ' After the six individuals who had thus pledged them selves returned to their native city, the event being duly bruited abroad caused such an effect that, when the next pilgrimage season came, twelve, or according to others forty persons, led by As'ad bin Zarahah, accompanied the original converts, and in the same place swore the ' Second Fealty of the Steep.' The Prophet dismissed them in company with one Musab bin Umayr, a Meccan, charged to teach them the Koran and their religious duties, which in those times consisted only of prayer and the Profession of Unity. They arrived at Al-Madinah on a Friday, and this was the first day on which the city witnessed the public devotions of the Moslems. After some persecutions, Musab had the fortune to convert a cousin of As'ad bin Zararah, a chief of the Aus, Sa'ad bin Ma'az, whose opposition had been of the fiercest. He persuaded his tribe, the Benu Abd al-Ashhal, to break Prophet's grandfather, was the son of Salma, and was bred at A1 Madinah. 1 Ayyas bin Ma'az died, it is said, a Moslem. 2 ' Bayat al-Akabat al-ula.' It is so called because this oath was sworn at a place called Al-Akabah (the Mountain-road), near Muna. A Mosque was afterwards built there to commemorate t e event.XVII.— History of th Prophet's 353 their idols and openly to profess Al-Islam. The next season, Musab having made many converts, some say seventy, others three hundred, marched from Al-Madinah to Meccah for their pilgrimage ; and there induced his followers to meet the Prophet at midnight upon the Steep near Muna. Mohammed preached to them their duties towards Allah and himself, especially insisting upon the necessity of warring down infidelity. They pleaded ancient treaties with the Jews of Al-Madinah, and showed apprehension lest the Apostle, after bringing them into disgrace with their fellows, should desert them and return to the faith of his kinsmen, the Kuraysh. Mohammed, smiling, comforted them with the assurance that he was with them, body and soul, for ever. Upon this they asked him what would be their reward if slain. He re plied, 'Gardens 'neath which the streams flow,'—that is to say, Paradise. Then, in spite of the advice of Al-Abbas, Mohammed's uncle, who was loud in his denunciations, they bade the Preacher stretch out his hand, and upon it swore the oath known as the ' Great Fealty of the Steep.' After com forting them with an Ayat, or Koranic verse, which pro mised heaven, the Apostle divided his followers into twelve bodies ; and placing a chief at the head of each, 1 dismissed them to their homes. He rejected the offer made by one of the party—namely, to slay all the idolaters present at the pilgrimage—saying that Allah had favoured him with no such order. For the same reason he refused their invitation to visit Al-Madinah, which was the prin cipal object of their mission ; and he then took an affec tionate leave of them. 1 Some Moslem writers suppose that Mohammed singled out twelve men as apostles, and called them Nakil, in imitation of the example of our Saviour. Other Moslems ignore both the fact and the intention. M. C. de Perceval gives the names of these Nakils in vol. hi. p. 8. vol. i. 23354 Pilgvimage to Al-MadimJ Meccah. Two months and a half after the events above detailed, Mohammed received the inspired tidings that Al-Madinah of the Hijaz was his predestined asylum. In anticipation of the order, for as yet the time had not been revealed, he sent forward his friends, among whom were Omar,Talhah, and Hamzah, retaining with him Abu Bakr 1 and Ali. The particulars of the Flight, that eventful accident to Al- Islam, are too well known to require mention here; besides which they belong rather to the category of general than of Madinite history. Mohammed was escorted into Al-Madinah by one Buraydat al-Aslami and eighty men of the same tribe, who had been offered by the Kuraysh a hundred camels for the capture of the fugitives. But Buraydat, after listening to their terms, accidentally entered into conver sation with Mohammed ; and no sooner did he hear the name of his interlocutor, than he professed the faith of Al- Islam. He then prepared for the Apostle a standard by attaching his turband to a spear, and anxiously inquired what house was to be honoured by the presence of Allah s chosen servant. ' Whichever,' replied Mohammed, 'this she-camel 2 is ordered to show me.' At the last 1 Orthodox Moslems do not fail to quote this circumstance in honour of the first Caliph, upon whom moreover they bestow the title of ' Friend of the Cave.' The Shi'ahs. on the other hand, hating Abu Bakr, see in it a symptom of treachery, and declare that the Prophet feared to let the ' Old Hyena,' as they opprobriously term the venerable successor, out of his sight for fear lest he should act as spy to the Kuraysh. The voice of history and of common sense is against the Shi'ahs. M. C. de Perceval justly remarks, that Abu Bakr and Omar were men truly worthy of their great predecessor. 2 This animal's name, according to some, was Al-Kaswa ('the tips of whose ears are cropped '); according to others Al-Jada'a ('one mutilated in the ear, hand, nose, or lip'). The Prophet bought her for 800 dirhams, on the day before his flight, from Abu Bakr, who a fattened two fine animals of his own breeding. The camel was offered as a gift, but Mohammed insisted upon paying its price, because, say the Moslem casuists, he being engaged in the work 0call, ibovedetaile^ • n ail ticipaiie! a revealed, it ^marjallali, 1 andAH, ft -cident to fl lention heu; le idinah by ie same tr undredcamd iuraydat,alt :d into lid he hear tk the faith of 11 a standard l] iouslyinqiitii jenceofAllit 1 1 Mohaim Attlielas his circums r they bestow ft the other le and declare tki pprobriouslytt est he shoi f common sets ■ks, that Abu M &gt;decessor. ,s Al-Kaswif* rsAl-Jada'a rophet boai tbuBakr.n The camel paying its F® 3d in ' XVII.— History of t halting -place, he accidentally met some of his disciples returning from a trading voyage to Syria ; they dressed him and his companion Abu Bakr in white clothing which, it is said, caused the people of Kuba to pay a mistaken reverence to the latter. The Moslems of Al -Madinah were in the habit of repairing every morning to the heights near the city, looking out for the Apostle ; and, when the sun waxed hot, they returned home. One day, about noon, a Jew, who discovered the retinue from afar, suddenly warned the nearest party of Ansar, or Auxiliaries of Al-Madinah, that the fugitive was come. They snatched up their arms and hurried from their houses to meet him. Mohammed's she-camel advanced to the centre of the then flourishing town of Kuba. There she suddenly knelt upon a place which is now consecrated ground ; at that time it was an open space, belonging, they say, to Abu Ayyub the Ansari, who had a house there near the abo4es of the Benu Amr bin Auf. This event happened on the first day of the week, the twelfth of the month Rabia al- Awwal 1 (June 28, a.d. 622), in the firstyear of the Flight: for which reason Monday, which also witnessed the birth, the mission, and the death of the Prophet, is an auspicious day to Al-Islam.

C. de Perceval, the Prophet preached from the back of Al-Kaswa the cele brated pilgrimage sermon at Arafat on the 8th March, a.d. 632. 1 The Prophet is generally supposed to have started from Meccah on the first of the same month, on a Friday or a Monday. This dis crepancy is supposed to arise from the fact that Mohammed fled his house in Meccah on a Friday, passed three days in the cave on Jabal Saur, and finally left it for Al-Madinah on Monday, which therefore, according to Moslem divines, was the first day of the Hijrah.' But the sera now commences on the 1st of the previous Muharram, an arrangement made seventeen years after the date of the flight by Omar the Caliph, with the concurrence of Ali. —356 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. first Mosque upon the lines where his she-camel trod, the Apostle was joined by Ali, who had remained at Meccah, for the purpose of returning certain trusts and deposits committed to Mohammed's charge. He waited three days longer ; on Friday morning (the 16th Rabia al-Awwal, a.h. i ,=2nd July, a.d. 622), about sunrise he mounted Al- Kaswa, and, accompanied by a throng of armed Ansar on foot and on horseback, he took the way to the city. At the hour of public prayer, 1 he halted in the Wady or valley near Kuba, upon the spot where the Masjid al-Jum'ah now stands, performed his devotions, and preached an eloquent sermon. He then remounted. Numbers pressed forward to offer him hospitality ; he blessed them, and bade them stand out of the way, declaring that Al-Kaswa would halt of her own accord at the predestined spot. He then advanced to where the Apostle's pulpit now stands. There the she-camel knelt, and the rider exclaimed, as one inspired, 'This is our place, if Almighty Allah please!' Descending from Al-Kaswa, he recited, 'O Lord, cause me to alight a good Alighting, and Thou art the Best of those who cause to alight!' Presently the camel rose unaided, advanced a few steps, and then, according to some, returning, sat down upon her former seat; according to others, she knelt at the door of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, whose abode in those days was the nearest to the halting-place. The descendant of the Jewish High Priest in the time of the Tobbas, with the Apostle's per mission, took the baggage off the camel, and carried it into his house. Then ensued great rejoicings. The Abyssinians came and played with their spears. The 1 The distance from Kuba to Al-Madinah is little more than three miles, for which six hours—Friday prayers being about noon may be considered an inordinately long time. But our author might urge as a reason that the multitude of people upon a narrow road rendered the Prophet's advance a slow one, and some historians relate that he spent several hours in conversation with the Benu SalimXVII. — History of the Prophet''s 357 len, accordu former seal; 3f Abu Ajjl the nearest tij !

And all the wives of the Ansar celebrated with shrill cries of joy the auspicious event; whilst the males, young and old, freemen and slaves, shouted with effusion, 'Allah's Messenger is come! Allah's Messenger is here!' Mohammed caused Abu Ayyub and his wife to remove into the upper story, contenting himself with the humbler lower rooms. This was done for the greater convenience of receiving visitors without troubling the family; but the master of the house was thereby rendered uncomfortable in mind. His various remarks about the Apostle's diet and domestic habits, especially his avoiding leeks, onions, and garlic, 1 are gravely chronicled by Moslem authors. After spending seven months, more or less, at the house of Abu Ayyub, Mohammed, now surrounded by his wives and family, built, close to the Mosque, huts for their reception. The ground was sold to him by Sahal and Suhayl, two orphans of the Benu Najjar, 2 a noble family of the Khazraj. Some time afterwards one Harisat bin al-Nu'uman presented to the Prophet all his houses in the vicinity of the temple. In those days the habitations of the Arabs were made of a framework of Jar id or palm sticks, covered over with a cloth of camel's hair, a curtain of similar stuff forming the door. The more splendid had walls of unbaked brick, and roofs of palm fronds plastered 1 Mohammed never would eat these strong smelling vegetables on account of his converse with the angels, even as modern ' Spirit ualists' refuse to smoke tobacco; at the same time he allowed his followers to do so, except when appearing in his presence, entering a Mosque, or joining in public prayers. The pious Moslem still eats his onions with these limitations. Some sects, however, as the Wah- habis, considering them abominable, avoid them on all occasions. 2 The name of the tribe literally means ' sons of a carpenter ' ; hence the error of the learned and violent Humphrey Prideaux, cor rected by Sale.358 Pilgrimage to Al-Madina Mcccah. over with mud or clay. Of this description were the abodes of Mohammed's family. Most of them were built on the North and East of the Mosque, which had open ground on the Western side; and the doors looked towards the place of prayer. In course of time, all, except Abu Bakr 1 and Ali, were ordered to close their doors, and even Omar was refused the favour of having a window opening into the temple. Presently the Jews of Al-Madinah, offended by the conduct of Abdullah bin Salam, their most learned priest and a descendant from the Patriarch Joseph, who had become a convert to the Moslem dispensation, began to plot against Mohammed. 2 They were headed by Hajj bin Akhtah, and his brother Yasir bin Akhtah, and were joined by many of the Aus and the Khazraj. The events that followed this combination of the Munafikun, or Hypocrites, under their chief, Abdullah, belong to the domain of Arabian history. 8 Mohammed spent the last ten years of his life at Al- Madinah. He died on Monday, some say at nine a.m., others at noon, others a little after, on the twelfth of Rabia al-Awwal in the eleventh year of the Hijrah. When his family and companions debated where he should be buried, Ali advised Al-Madinah, and Abu Bakr, Ayishah 's cham - 1 Some say that Abu Bakr had no abode near the Mosque. But it is generally agreed upon, that he had many houses, one in Al-Bakia, another in the higher parts of Al-Madinah, and among them a hut on the spot between the present gates called Salam and Rahmah. 2 It is clear from the fact above stated, that in those days the Jews of Arabia were in a state of excitement, hourly expecting the advent of their Messiah, and that Mohammed believed himself to be the person appointed to complete the law of Moses. 3 In many minor details the above differs from the received accounts of Pre-Islamitic and early Mohammedan history. Let the blame be borne by the learned Shaykh Abd al-Hakk al -Muhaddis 0 Delhi, and his compilation, the M Jazb al-Kulub ilaDiyar al-Mahhub (the ' Drawing of Hearts towards the Holy Parts '). From the multi tude of versions at last comes correctness.aW XV11.— History of the 359 ber, quoting a saying of the deceased that prophets and martyrs are always interred where they happen to die. The Apostle was placed, it is said, under the bed where he had given up the ghost, by Ali and the two sons of Abbas, who dug the grave. With the life of Mo hammed the interest of Al-Madinah ceases, or rather is concentrated in the history of its temple. Since then the city has passed through the hands of the Caliphs, the Sharifs of Meccah, the Sultans of Con stantinople, the Wahhabis, and the Egyptians. It has now reverted to the Sultan, whose government is beginning to believe that, in these days when religious prestige is of little value, the great Khan's title, ' Servant of the Holy Shrines,' is purchased at too high a price. As has before been observed, the Turks now struggle for existence in Al-Hijaz with a soldier ever in arrears, and officers unequal to the task of managing an unruly people. The pensions are but partly paid, 1 and they are not likely to increase with years. It is probably a mere considera tion of interest that prevents the people rising 1 A Firman from the Porte, dated 13th February, 1841, provides for the paying of these pensions regularly. ' It being customary to send every year from Egypt provisions in kind to the two Holy Cities, the provisions and other articles, whatever they may be, which have up to this time been sent to this place, shall continue to be sent thither.' Formerly the Holy Land had immense property in Egypt, and indeed in all parts of Al-Islam. About thirty years ago, Mohammed Ali Pasha bought up all theWakf (church property), agreeing to pay for its produce, which he rated at five piastres the ardeb, when it was worth three times as much. Even that was not regularly paid. The Sultan has taken advantage of the present crisis to put down Wakf in Turkey. The Holy Land, therefore, will gradually lose all its land and house property, and will soon be compelled to depend entirely upon the presents of the pilgrims, and the Sadakah, or alms, which are still sent to it by the pious Moslems of distant regions. As might be supposed, both the Meccans and the Madani loudly bewail their hard fates, and by no means approve of the Ikram, the modern succedaneum for an extensive and regularly paid revenue. At a future time, I shall recur to this subject.360 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah and re-asserting the liberties of their country.

After that time a fresh revela tion turned them in the direction of Meccah, Southwards: on which occasion the Archangel Gabriel descended and miraculously opened through the hills and wilds a view of the Ka'abah, that there might be no difficulty in ascer taining its true position. After the capture of Khaybar in a.h. 7, the Prophet and his first three successors restored the Mosque, but Moslem historians do not consider this a second founda tion. Mohammed laid the first brick, and Abu Hurayrah declares that he saw him carry heaps of building materials piled up to his breast. The Caliphs, each in the turn of his succession, placed a brick close to that laid by the Prophet, and aided him in raising the walls. Al-Tabrani relates that one of the Ansar had a house adjacent which Mohammed wished to make part of the place of prayer; the proprietor was promised in exchange for it a home in Paradise, which he gently rejected, pleading poverty. His excuse was admitted, and Osman, after purchasing the place for ten thousand dirhams, gave it to the Apostle on the long credit originally offered. This Mosque was a square of a hundred cubits. Like the former building, it had three doors : one on the South side, where the Mihrab al-Nabawi, or the 'Proph et's Niche,' now is; another in the place of the present Bab al-Rahmah; and the third at the Bab Osman, now called the Gate of Gabriel. Instead of a Mihrab or prayer-niche, 1 a large block of stone directed the congre gation; at first it was placed against the Northern wall i The prayer-niche and the minaret both date their existence j from the days of Al-Walid, the builder of the third Mosque. At this age of their empire, the Moslems had travelled far and had seen art in various lands; it is therefore not without a shadow of reason that the Hindus charge them with having borrowed their two favourite symbols, and transformed them into an arch and a tower.362 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah of the Mosque, and it was removed to the Southern when Meccah became the Kiblah. In the beginning the Prophet, whilst preaching the Khutbah or Friday sermon, leaned when fatigued against a post. 1 The Mambar, 2 or pulpit, was the invention of a Madinah man, of the Benu Najjar. It was a wooden frame, two cubits long by one broad, with three steps, each one span high; on the topmost of these the Prophet sat when he required rest. The pulpit assumed its pres ent form about a.h. 90, during the artistic reign of Al- Walid. In this Mosque Mohammed spent the greater part of the day 3 with his companions, conversing, instructing, and 1 The Ustawanat al-Hannanah, or ^ Weeping-Post.' Seepage 335, chapter XVI., ante. 2 As usual, there are doubts about the invention of this article. It was covered with cloth by the Caliph Osman, or, as others say, by Al-Mu'awiyah, who, deterred by a solar eclipse from carrying out his project of removing it to Damascus, placed it upon a new framework, elevated six steps above the ground. Al-Mahdi wished to raise the Mambar six steps higher, but was forbidden so to do by the Imam Malik. The Abbasides changed the pulpit, and converted the Prophet's original seat into combs, which were pre served as relics. Some historians declare that the original Mam bar was burnt with the Mosque in a.h. 654. In Ibn Jubayr's time (a.h. 580), it was customary for visitors to place their right hands upon a bit of old wood, inserted into one of the pillars of the pulpit; this was supposed to be a remnant of the 'weep ing-post.Every Sultan added some ornament to the Mam bar, and at one time it was made of white marble, covered over with a dome of the M eight metals.' It is now a handsome structure, apparently of wood, painted and gilt of the usual elegant form, which has been compared by some travellers with the suggest a of Roman Catholic churches. I have been explicit about this pulpit, hoping that, next time the knotty question of Apostolic seats comes upon the tapis, our popular authors will not confound a Curule chair with a Moslem Mambar. Of the latter article. Lane (Mod.

Hard by were the abodes of his wives, his family, and his principal friends. Here he prayed, at the call of the Azan, or devotion-cry, from the roof. Here he received worldly envoys and embassies, and the heavenly messages conveyed by the Archangel Gabriel. And within a few yards of the hallowed spot, he died, and found a grave. The theatre of events so important to Al-Islam could not be allowed—especially as no divine decree forbade the change—to remain in its pristine lowliness. The first Caliph contented himself with merely restoring some of the palm pillars, which had fallen to the ground: Omar, the second successor, surrounded the Hujrah, or Ayishah's chamber, in which the Prophet was buried, with a mud wall; and in a.h. 17, he ^enlarged the Mosque to 140 cubits by 120, taking in ground on all sides except the Eastern, where stood the abodes of the ' Mothers of the Moslems. 1 ' Outside the Northern wall he erected a Suffah, called Al-Batha—a raised bench of wood, earth, or stone, upon which the people might recreate them selves with conversation and quoting poetry, for the Mosque was now becoming place of peculiar reverence to men. 2 The second Masjid was erected a.h. 29, by the third Caliph, Osman, who, regardless of the clamours of the people, overthrew the old walls and extended the building here, according to some, he lodged Mariyah, the Coptic girl. ^ As pilgrims do not usually visit the place, and nothing of the original building can be now remaining, I did not trouble myself about it. 1 Meaning the Prophet's fifteen to twenty-five wives. Their number is not settled. He left nine wives and two concubines. It was this title after the Koranic order (chap, xxxiii. w. 53) which rendered their widowhood eternal; no Arab would willingly marry a woman whom he has called mother or sister. 2 Authors mention a place outside the Northern wall called Al- SufFah, which was assigned by Mohammed as a habitation to houseless believers; from which circumstance these paupers derived the title of Ashab al-Suffah, 'Companions of the Sofa.'364 Pilgrimage to Al-Madina Meccah. greatly towards the North, and a little towards the West; but he did not remove the Eastern limit on account of the private houses. He made the roof of Indian teak, 1 and the walls of hewn and carved stone. These innovations caused some excitement, which he allayed by quoting a tradition of the Prophet, with one of which he appears perpetually to have been prepared. The saying in question was, according to some, ' Were this my Mosque extended to Safa'—a hill in Meccah—'it verily would still be my Mosque'; according to others, 'Were the Prophet's Mosque extended to Zu'l Halifah 2 it would still be his.' But Osman's skill in the quotation of tra dition did not prevent the new building being in part a cause of his death. It was finished on the first Muharram, a.h. 30. At length, Al-Islam, grown splendid and powerful, determined to surpass other nations in the magnificence of its public buildings. 8 In a.h. 88, Al-Walid 4 the First, twelfth Caliph of the Benu Ummayah race, after build ing, or rather restoring, the noble 'Jami' al-Ammawi' (cathedral of the Ommiades) at Damascus, determined to 1 So I translate the Arabicised word 'Saj.' , 2 A place about five miles from Al-Madinah, on the Meccan way.

As will be seen, he had every advan tage of borrowing from Christian, Persian, and even Indian art. From the first he took the dome, from the second the cloister—it might have been naturalised in Arabia before his time—and possibly from the third the minaret and the prayer-niche.

The governer of the place, Umar bin Abd Al-Aziz, was directed to buy for seven thousand Dinars (ducats) all the hovels of raw brick that hedged in the Eastern side of the old Mosque. They were inhabited by descendants of the Prophet and of the early Caliphs, and in more than one case, the ejection of the holy tenantry was effected with consider able difficulty. Some of the women—ever the most obstinate on such occasions—refused to take money, and Omar was forced to the objectionable measure of turning them out of doors with exposed faces 1 in full day. The Greek Emperor, applied to by the magnificent Caliph, sent immense presents, silver lamp chains, valuable curi osities, 2 forty loads of small cut stones for pietra-dura, and a sum of eighty thousand Dinars, or, as others say, forty thousand Miskals of gold. He also despatched forty Coptic and forty Greek artists to carve the marble pillars and the casings of the walls, and to superintend the gilding and the mosaic work. One of these Christians was beheaded for sculpturing a hog on the Kiblah wall, and another, in an attempt to defile the roof, fell to the ground, and his brains were dashed out. The remainder Islamized, but this did not prevent the older Arabs mur muring that their Mosque had been turned into a Kamsah, a Christian idol-house. The Hujrah, or chamber, where, by Mohammed^s permission, Azrail, the Angel of Death, separated his 1 The reader will remember that in the sixth year of the Hijrah, after Mohammed's marriage with Zaynab, his wives were secluded behind the Hijab, Pardah, or curtain. A verse of the Koran directed the Moslems to converse with them behind this veil. Hence the general practice of Al-Islam: now it is considered highly disgraceful in any Moslem to make a Moslemah expose her face, and she will frequently found a threat upon the prejudice. A battle has been prevented by this means, and occasionally an insurrection has been caused by it. 2 Amongst which some authors enumerate the goblet and the mirror of Kisra.366 Pilgrimage to Al-Madina Meccah, soul from his body, whilst his head was lying in the lap of Ayishah, his favourite wife, was now for the first time taken into the Mosque. The raw-brick enceinte 1 which surrounded the three graves was exchanged for one of carved stone, enclosed by an outer precinct with a nar- ! row passage between. 2 These double walls were either without a door, or had only a small blocked-up wicket on the Northern side, and from that day (a.h. 90), no one, says Al-Samanhudi, has been able to approach the sepulchre. 8 A minaret was erected at each*corner of the Mosque. 4 The building was enlarged to 200 cubits by 167, and was finished in a.h. 91. When Al-Walid, the Caliph, visited it in state, he inquired of his lieutenant why greater magnificence had not been displayed in the erection ; upon which Omar, the governor, informed him, 1 The outer wall, built by Al-Walid, remained till a.h. 550, when Jamal al-Din of Isafahan, Wazir to Nur al-Din Shahid Mahmud bin Zangi, supplied its place by a grating of open sandal woodwork, or, as others say, of iron. About the same time, Sayyid Abu '1 Hayja sent from Egypt a sheet of white brocade, embroidered in red silk with the chapter Y. S., in order to cover the inner wall. This was mounted on the accession of Al-Mustazi bi'Mh, the Caliph, after which it became the custom for every Sultan to renew the offering. And in a.h. 688, Kalaun of Egypt built the outer network of brass as it now is, and surmounted it with the Green Dome. 2 The inner wall, erected by Al-Walid, seems to have resisted the fire which in a.h. 654 burnt the Mosque to the ground. Also, in a.h. 886, when the building was consumed by lightning, the Hujrah was spared by the devouring element. 3 After theProphet'sdeath and burial, Ayishah continued to occupy the same room, without even a curtain between her and the tomb. At last, vexed by the crowds of visitors, she partitioned off the hal lowed spot with a wall. She visited the grave unveiled as long as her father Abu Bakr only was placed behind the Prophet; but when Omar's corpse was added, she always covered her face. 4 One of these, the minaret at the Bab-al-Salam, was soon after wards overthrown by Al-Walid's brother Sulayman, because it shaded the house of Marwan, where he lodged during his visit to Al-Madinah in the cold season.mam XVII.— History of th 367 to his astonishment, that the walls alone had cost forty- five thousand ducats. 1 The fourth Mosque was erected in a.h. 191, by Al- Mahdi, third prince of the Benu Abbas or Baghdad Caliphs—celebrated in history only for spending enor mous sums upon a pilgrimage. He enlarged the building by adding ten handsome pillars of carved marble, with gilt capitals, on the Northern side. In a.h. 202, Al- Ma'amun made further additions to this Mosque. It was from Al-Mahdi's Masjid that Al-Hakim bi 'Amri 'llah, the third Fatimite Caliph of Egypt, and the deity of the Druze sect, determined to steal the bodies of the Prophet and his two companions. About a.h. 4 i2 &gt; I 16 sen t emis saries to Al-Madinah: the attempt, however, failed, and the would-be violators of the tomb lost their lives. It is generally supposed that Al-Hakim's object was to transfer the Visitation to his own capital; but in one so manifestly insane it is difficult to discover the spring of action. Two Christians, habited like Maghrabi pilgrims, in a. h. 550, dug a mine from a neighbouring house into the temple. They were discovered, beheaded, and burned to ashes. In relating these events the Moslem historians mix up many foolish preternaturalisms with credible matter. At last, to prevent a recurrence of such sacri legious attempts, Al-Malik al-Adil Nur al-Din of the Baharite Mamluk Sultans, or, according to others, Sultan Nur al-Din Shahid Mahmud bin Zangi, who, warned by a vision of the Apostle, had started for Al-Madinah only in time to discover the two Christians, surrounded the holy place with a deep trench filled with molten lead. By this means Abu Bakr and Omar, who had run con siderable risks of their own, have ever since been enabled to occupy their last homes undisturbed. In a.h. 654, the fifth Mosque was erected in conse quence of a fire, which some authors attribute to a 1 The dinar (denarius) was a gold piece, a ducat, a sequin.368 Pilgvivicigc to Al'Mudiucih ciud Mccc&amp;h. volcano that broke out close to the town in terrible ■ Duri eruption 1 ; others, with more fanaticism and less proba- Mohamir bility, to the schismatic Benu Husayn, then the guardians wax ca ^ of the tomb.

This building was enlarged and beautified considera by the princes of Egypt, and lasted upwards of two pied b] , , , terrified hundred years. The sixth Mosque was built, almost as it now stands, J™ 111 ) by Kaid-Bey, nineteenth Sultan of the Circassian Mam- luk kings of Egypt, in a.h. 888: it is now therefore more than four centuries old. Al-Mustasim's Mosque had been struck by lightning during a storm; thirteen men were killed at prayers, and the destroying element spared Meccah, nothing but the interior of the Hujrah. 2 The railing and ^pital 8 dome were restored; niches and a pulpit were sent from rebuild Cairo, and the gates and minarets were distributed as anceoft they are now. Not content with this, Ixaid-Bey estab- § r ee lished ' Wakf' (bequests) and pensions, and introduced Two of order among the attendants on the tomb. In the tenth — century, Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent paved with fine white marble the Rauzah or garden, which Kaid-Bey, not daring to alter, had left of earth, and erected the fin^ minaret that bears his name. _____ however, Durri s ' 1 from evei said, for 1 Bur of the W; 2 See 3 My lave bee town ap] 1 I purpose to touch upon this event in a future chapter, when describing my route from Al-Madinah to Meccah. i 2 ' On this occasion,' says Al-Samanhudi, quoted by Burckhardt, — '• the interior of the Hujrah was cleared, and three deep graves were found in the inside, full of rubbish, but the author of this history, ^ who himself entered it. saw no traces of tombs.' Yet in another place he. an eye-witness, had declared that the coffin containing the of ^ n dust of Mohammed was cased with silver.

The present head of Al-Islamis, as I have before said, rebuilding one of the minarets and the Northern colonnade of the temple. Such is the history of the Mosque's prosperity. During the siege of Al-Madinah by the Wahhabis, 1 the principal people seized and divided amongst them selves the treasures of the tomb, which must have been considerable. When the town surrendered, Sa'ud, accom panied by his principal officers, entered the Hujrah, but, terrified by dreams, he did not penetrate behind the curtain, or attempt to see the tomb. He plundered, however, the treasures in the passage, the ' Kaukab al- Durri 2 ' (or pearl star), and the ornaments sent as presents from every part of Al-Islam. Part of these he sold, it is said, for 150,000 Riyals (dollars), to Ghalib, Sharif of Meccah, and the rest he carried with him to Daraiyah, his capital.® An accident prevented any further desecration of the building. The greedy Wahhabis, allured by the appear ance of the golden or gilt globes and crescents surmounting the green dome, attempted to throw down the latter. Two of their number, it is said, were killed by falling 1 Burckhardt has given a full account of this event in his history of the Wahhabis. 2 See Chapter XVI., ante. 3 My predecessor estimates the whole treasury in those days to have been worth 300,000 Riyals,—a small sum, if we consider the length of time during which it was accumulating. The chiefs of the town appropriated 1 cwt. of golden vessels, worth at most 50,000 dollars, and Sa'ud sold part of the plunder to Ghalib for 100,000 (I was told one-third more), reserving for himself about the same amount of pearls and corals. Burckhardt supposes that the governors of Al-Madinah, who were often independent chiefs, and sometimes guardians of the tombs, made occasional draughts upon the generosity of the Faithful. VOL.

Osman When Abdullah, son of Sa'ud, had concluded in a.d. 1815 a treaty of peace with Tussun Pasha, the Egyptian General bought back from the townspeople, for 10,000 Riyals, all the golden vessels that had not been melted down, and restored the treasure to its original place. This I have heard denied; at the same time it rests upon credible evidence.

It is still extensive, because in the first place the principle of divided labour is a favourite throughout the East, and secondly because the Sons of the Holy Cities naturally desire to extract as much as they can from the Sons of other cities with the least amount of work. The substance of the following account was given to me by Omar Effendi, and I compared it with the information of others upon whom I could rely. The principal of the Mosque, or Shaykh al-Harim, is no longer a neuter. 1 The present is a Turkish Pasha, Osman, appointed from Constantinople with a salary of about 30,000 piastres a month. His Naib or deputy is a black eunuch, the chief of the Aghawat, 2 upon a pay of 5000 piastres. The present principal of this college is one Tayfur Agha, a slave of Esma Sultanah, sister to the late Sultan Mahmud. The chief treasurer is called the Mudir al-Harim ; he keeps an eye upon the Khaznadar, or treasurer, whose salary is 2000 piastres. The Mustas- lim is the chief of the Katibs, or writers who settle the 1 The Persians in remote times, as we learn from Herodotus (lib, 6), were waited upon by eunuchs, and some attribute to them the invention. Ammianus Marcellinus (lib. 14) ascribes the origin to Semiramis. In Al-Islam, the employment of such persons about the Mosque is a 11 Bida'ah n or custom unknown in the time of the Pro phet. It is said to have arisen from the following three considera tions : 1. These people are concentrated in their professions; 2. They must see and touch strange women at the shrines; and 3. The shrines are 11 Harim,' or sacred, having adyta which are kept secret from the prying eyes of men, and, therefore, should be served by eunuchs. It is strange that the Roman Catholic church, as well as the Moslem Mosque, should have admitted such an abomination. 2 One of these gentry, if called ' Tawashi,'—his generic name,— would certainly insult a stranger. The polite form of address to one of them is 14 Agha '—Master,^—in the plural 44 Aghawat.' In partibus, they exact the greatest respect from men, and the title of the Eunuch of the Tomb is worth a considerable sum to them. The eunuchs of Al- Madinah are more numerous and better paid than those of Meccah: they are generally the slaves of rich men at Constantinople, and prefer this city on account of its climate.372 Pilgrimage toAl-M adinah accounts of the Mosque; his pay is 1500, and under him is a Nakib or assistant upon 1000 piastres. There are three Shaykhs of the eunuchs who receive from 700 to 1000 piastres a month each. The eunuchs, aboi ■ a hundred and twenty in number, are divided mt ;i three orders. The Bawwabin, or porters, open th ; doors of the Mosque. The Khubziyah sweep the pure parts of the temple, and the lowest order, popularly called 'Battalin,' clean away all impurities, beat those found sleeping, and act as beadles, a duty here which involves considerable use of the cane. These men receive as perquisites presents from each visitor when they offer him the usual congratulation, and for other small favours, such as permitting strangers to light the lamps, 1 or to sweep the floor. Their pay varies from 250 to 500 piastres a month : they are looked upon as honour able men, and are, generally speaking, married, some of them indulging in three or four wives,—which would have aroused Juvenal's bile. The Agha's character is curious and exceptional as his outward conformation. Discon nected with humanity, he is cruel, fierce, brave, and capable of any villany. His frame is unnaturally long and lean, especially the arms and legs, with high shoulders, protruding joints, and a face by contrast extraordinarily large ; he is unusually expert in the use of weapons, and sitting well ' home,' he rides to admira tion, his hoarse, thick voice investing him with all the circumstances of command. Besides the eunuchs, there are a number of free ser vants, called Farrashin, attached to the Mosque ; almost all the middle and lower class of citizens belong to this order. They are divided into parties of thirty each, and are changed every week, those on duty receiving a Ghazi or twenty-two piastres for their services. Their business 1 The ' Sons of the City,' however, are always allowed to do such service gratis; if, indeed, they are not paid for it.XVII.— History of t 373 is to dust, and to spread the carpets, to put oil and wicks into the lamps which the eunuchs let down from the ceil? ,ing, and, generally speaking, diligently to do nothing. Finally, the menial establishment of the Mosque con sists of a Shaykh al-Sakka (chief of the water-carriers), .inder whom are from forty-five to fifty men who sprinkle the floors, water the garden, and, for a consideration, supply a cupful of brackish liquid to visitors. The literary establishment is even more extensive than the executive and the menial. There is a Kazi, or chief judge, sent every year from Constantinople. After twelve months at Al-Madinah, he passes on to Meccah, and returns home after a similar term of service in the second Holy City. Under him are three Muftis, 1 of the Hanafi, the Shafe'i, and the Maliki schools ; the fourth, or Hanbali, is not represented here or at Cairo. 2 Each of these officers receives as pay about two hundred and fifty piastres a month. The Ruasa, 8 as the Mu'ezzins (prayer- callers) here call themselves, are extensively represented; there are forty-eight or forty-nine of the lowest order, pre sided over by six Kubar or Masters, and these again are under the Shaykh al-Ruasa, who alone has the privilege of calling to prayers from the Raisiyah minaret. The Shaykh receives a hundred and fifty piastres, the chiefs about a hundred, and the common criers sixty ; there are 1 Others told me that there were only two muftis at Al-Madinah, namely, those of the Hanafi and Shafe'i schools. If this be true, it proves the insignificance of the followers of Malik, which personage, like others, is less known in his own town than elsewhere. 2 The Hanbali school is nowhere common except in Nijd, and the lands Eastward as far as Al-Hasa. At present it labours under a sort of imputation, being supposed to have thrown out a bad offshoot, the Wahhabis. 3 ' Ruasa ' is the plural of Rais, a chief or president. It is the term generally applied in Arabia to the captain of a vessel, and in Al- Yaman it often means a barber, in virtue, I presume, of its root— Ras, the head.financier Khatibs, inittee, a topensic the nuir sioners. fess, lee Tb Th Th inder the Ah tlose s Oi informi 374 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. forty-five Khatibs, who preach and pray before the con gregation on Fridays for a hundred and twenty piastres a month ; they are under the Shaykh al-Khutaba. About the same sum is given to seventy-five Imams, who recite the five ordinary prayers of every day in the Mosque ; the Shaykh al-Aimmat is their superior. 1 Almost all the citizens of Al-Madinah who have not some official charge about the temple qualify themselves to act as MuzawWirs. They begin as boys to learn tha formula of prayer, and the conducting of visitors ; and partly by begging, partly by boldness, they often pick up a tolerable livelihood at an early age. The Muzawwir will s ' uu ^ often receive strangers into his house, as was done to me, and direct their devotions during the whole time of their stay. For such service he requires a sum of money pro portioned to his guests' circumstances, but this fee does not end the connexion. If the Muzawwir visit the home of his Zair, he expects to be treated with the utmost hos pitality, and to depart with a handsome present. A reli gious visitor will often transmit to his cicerone at Meccah and at Al-Madinah yearly sums to purchase for himself a prayer at the Ka'abah and the Prophet's Tomb. The remittance is usually wrapped up in paper, and placed in a sealed leathern bag, somewhat like a portfolio, upon which is worked the name of the person entitled to receive it. It is then given in charge either to a trustworthy pilgrim, or to the public treasurer, who accompanies the principal caravans. I could procure no exact information about the amount of money forwarded every year from Constantinople and Cairo to Al-Madinah ; the only point upon which men seemed to agree was that they were defrauded of half their dues.

It is equally difficult to define, politically and geo graphically, the limits of Al-Hijaz. Whilst some authors, as Abulfeda, 1 fix its Northern frontier at Aylah (Fort Al- 'Akabah) and the Desert, making Al-Yaman its Southern limit, others include in it only the tract of land lying between Meccah and Al-*Madinah. The country has no natural boundaries, and its political limits change with every generation ; perhaps, therefore, the best distribution of its frontier would be that which includes all the property called Holy Land, making Yambu' the Northern, and Jed- dah the Southern extremes, while a line drawn through Al- Madinah, Suwayrkiyah, and Jabal Kora—the mountain of Taif—might represent its Eastern boundary. Thus Al- Hijaz would be an irregular parallelogram, about two hundred and fifty miles in length, with a maximum breadth of one hundred and fifty miles. Two meanings are assigned to the name of this venerated region. Most authorities make it mean the ' Separator,' the ' Barrier,' between Nijd and Tahamah^ or between Al-Yaman and Syria. According to others, it signifies the 44 colligated,' i .e by mountains. It is to be observed that the people of the country, especially the Badawin, distinguish the lowlands fro m th e high regions 1 To the East he limits Al-Hijaz by Yamamah (which some include in it).

Niebuhr places the Southern boundary at Hali, a little town south of Kunfudah (Gonfoda).

Ill by different names ; the former are called Tahamat al- H Hijaz—the sea coast of Al-Hijaz, as we should say in India, 'below the Ghauts;' the latter is known peculiarly Ij as Al-Hijaz. 1 j Madinat al-Nabi, 2 the Prophet's City, or, as it is i If you ask a Badawi near Meccah, whence his fruit comes, he will reply 'min Al-Hijaz,' 'from the Hijaz,' meaning from the I mountainous part of the country about Taif. This would be an argument in favour of those who make the word to signify a place j tied together,' (by mountains). It is notorious that the Badawin are the people who best preserve the use of old and disputed words ; for which reason they were constantly referred to by the learned in the palmy days of Moslem philology. ' Al-Hijaz,' also, in this signifi cation, well describes the country, a succession of ridges and mountain j chains; whereas such a name as 'the barrier' would appear to be rather the work of some geographer in his study. Thus Al-Nijd was | so called from its high and open lands, and, briefly, in this part of the world, names are most frequently derived from some physical and material peculiarity of soil or climate. 2 Amongst a people, who, like the Arabs or the Spaniards, hold a plurality of names to be a sign of dignity, so illustrious a spot as li Al-Madinah could not fail to be rich in nomenclature. A Hadis declares, 'to Al-Madinah belong ten names': books, however, enumerate nearly a hundred, of which a few will suffice as a speci- j men. Tabah, Tibah, Taibah, Tayyibah, and Mutayyibah, (from the i| r00 ^ Tib, 'good, ' 'sweet,' or 'lawful,') allude to the physical excel lencies of Al-Madinah as regards climate—the perfume of the . Prophet s tomb, and of the red rose, which was a thorn before it blos somed by the sweat of his brow—and to its being free from all moral impurity, such as the presence of Infidels, or worshippers of idols. | Mohammed declared that he was ordered by Allah to change the name of the place to Tabah, from Yasrib or Asrib. The latter, according to | some, wasca proper name of a son of Noah ; others apply it originally ; to a place west of Mount Ohod, not to Al-Madinah itself; and quote the plural form of the word, 'Asarib,' (' spots abounding in palms and ! fountains,') as a proof that it does not belong exclusively to a person. However this may be, the inauspicious signification of Yasrib, whose i root is ' Sarab,' (destruction,) and the notorious use of the name by ;• the Pagan Arabs, have combined to make it, like the other heathen designation, Al-Ghalabah, obsolete, and the pious Moslem who pro nounces the word is careful to purify his mouth by repeating ten times the name 'Al-Madinah.' Barah and Barrah allude to its373 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah usually called for brevity, Al-Madinah, City, is situated ^Jch on the borders of Nijd, upon the vast plateau of high land ca iied obedience and purity; Hasunah to its beauty; Khayrah and Khay- ffliy st yarah to its goodness ; Mababbah, Habibah and Mahbubah, to the at a ( favour it found in the eyes of the Prophet; whilst Jabirah, Jabbarah, accor( ] and Jabarah, (from the root Jabr, joining or breaking), at once denote , its good influence upon the fortunes of the Faithful and its evil effects . upon the Infidel.

In the Taurat or —— Pentateuch, the town is called Mukaddasah, the Holy, or Marhumah the Pitied, in allusion to the mission of Mohammed ; Marzukah, the Fed, is a favourable augury of plenty to it, and Miskinah, the Poor, e 5 hints that it is independent of treasure of gold or store of silver to keep up its dignity. Al-Makarr, means the Residence or the Place ^ of Quiet; Makinat, the Firmly-fixed, (in the right faith); Al-Harim, ^ the Sacred or Inviolable; and. finally, Al-Balad, the Town, and Al- Madinah, the City by excellence. So an inhabitant calls himself Al- £ Madani. whilst the natives of other and less-favoured ' Madinahs' ^ affix Madini to their names.

The limits of the sanctuary called the Hudud al-Harim, as defined by the Apostle, may still serve to mark out the city's plain. Northwards, at a distance of about three miles, is Jabal Ohod, or, according to others, Jabal Saur, a hill somewhat beyond Ohod ; these are the last ribs of the vast tertiary and primitive chine 1 which, extending from Taurus to near Aden, and from Aden again to Maskat, fringes the Arabian trapezium. To the South-west the plain is bounded by ridges of scoriaceous basalt, and by a buttress of rock called Jabal Ayr, like Ohod, about three miles distant from the town. Westward, according to some authors, is the Mosque Zu'l-Halifah. On the East there are no natural landmarks, nor even artificial, like the ' Ala- mayn' at Meccah ; an imaginary line, therefore, is drawn, forming an irregular circle of which the town is the centre, with a diameter from ten to twelve miles. Such is the sanctuary. 2 Geographically considered, the first sight it would appear—the old Guebres had in Arabia and Persia seven large fire temples, each dedicated to a planet. At ' Mahdinah,' as they pervert the word, was an image of the Moon, wherefore the place was originally called the ' Religion of the Moon.' These Guebres, amongst other sacred spots, claim Meccah, where they say Saturn and the Moon were conjointly venerated; Jerusalem, the Tomb of Ali at Najaf, that of Hosayn at Kerbela, and others. These pretensions of course the Moslems deny with insistance, which does not prevent certain symptoms of old and decayed faith peeping out in localities where their presence, if duly understood, would be con sidered an abomination. This curious fact is abundantly evident in Sind, and I have already alluded to it Sind). 1 Such is its formation in Al-Hijaz. 2 Within the sanctuary all Muharramat, or sins, are forbidden; but the several schools advocate different degrees of strictness. The Imam Malik, for instance, allows no nearer to Al-Madinah than Jabal Ayr, a distance of about three miles. He also forbids slaying wild animals, but at the same time he specifies no punish ment for the offence. Some do not allow the felling of trees, alleging that the Prophet enjoined their preservation as an ornament to the city, and a pleasure to visitors. Al-Khattabi, on the contrary, permits people to cut wood, and this is certainly the general practice.380 Pilgrimage to Al-Madimh Meccah. accordi iecting plain is bounded, on the East, with a thin line of low well as dark hills, traversed by the Darb al-Sharki, or the ' East- towards ern road,' through Al-Nijd to Meccah: Southwards, the Wester plateau is open, and almost perfectly level as far as the receive: eye can see. Al-Madinah dates its origin doubtless from ancient times, and the cause of its prosperity is evident in the Water, abundant supply of water, a necessary generally scarce in In the Arabia.

Some say Mohammed preferred the curious former, blessing it as Abraham did Meccah. Moreover, as a tradition ^ declares that every man's body is drawn from the dust of the ground ^ in which he is buried, Al-Madinah, it is evident, had the honour of supplying materials for the Prophet's person. Others, like Omar, that Za were uncertain in favour of which city to decide.

The water-flow is towards Al-Ghabbah, lowlands in the Northern and Western hills, a little beyond Mount Ohod. This basin receives the drainage of the mountains and the plain ; according to some absorbing it, according to others col lecting it till of sufficient volume to flow off to the sea. Water, though abundant, is rarely of good quality. In the days of the Prophet, the Madani consumed the produce of wells, seven of which are still celebrated by the people. 1 Historians relate that Omar, the second Caliph, provided the town with drinking-water from the Northern parts of the plains by means of an aqueduct. The modern city is supplied by a source called the Ayn al-Zarka or Azure Spring, 2 which arises some say at the foot of Mount Ayr, others, with greater probability, in the date-groves of Kuba. Its waters were first brought to Al-Madinah by Marwan, governor in Al-Mu'awiyah's day. It now flows down a subterraneous canal, about thirty feet below the surface ; in places the water is exposed to the air, and 1 These seven wells will be noticed in Chapter XIX., post. 2 I translate Al-Zarka 'azure,' although Sir G. Wilkinson remarks, apropos of the Bahr al-Azrak, generally translated by us the ' Blue Nile,' that, 'when the Arabs wish to say dark or jet black, they use the word 'Azrak.' ' It is true that Azrak is often applied to indeterminate dark hues, but ' Aswad,' not Azrak, is the opposite to Abyaz, ' white.' Moreover, Al-Zarka. in the feminine is applied to women with light blue eyes ; this would be no distinctive appellation if it signified black eyes, the almost universal colour. Zarka of Yamamah is the name of a celebrated heroine in Arab story, and the curious reader, who wishes to see how much the West is indebted to the East, even for the materials of legend, will do well to peruse her short history in Major Price's ' Essay,' or M. C. de Perceval's ' Essai,' &amp;c., vol. i., p. 101. Both of these writers, however, assert that Zarka's eyes, when cut out, were found to contain fibres blackened by the use of Kohl, and they attribute to her the invention of this pigment. I have often heard the legend from the Arabs, who declare that she painted her eyes with ' Ismid,' a yellow metal, of what kind I have never been able to determine, although its name is everywhere known.382 Pilgrimage to A steps lead to it for the convenience of the inhabitants: this was the work of Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent. After passing through the town it turns to the North-west, its course being marked by a line of circular walls breast high, like the Kariz of Afghanistan, placed at unequal distances, and resembling wells : it then loses itself in the Nakhil or palm-groves. During my stay at Al-Madinah, I always drank this water, which appeared to me, as the citizens declared it to be, sweet and wholesome. 1 There are many wells in the town, as water is found at about twenty feet below the surface of the soil: few produce anything fit for drinking, some being salt and others bitter. As usual in the hilly countries of the East, the wide beds and Fiumaras, even in the dry season, will supply travellers for a day or two with an abundance of water, filtrated through, and, in some cases, flowing beneath the sand. The climate of the plain is celebrated for a long, and, comparatively speaking, a rigorous winter; a popular saying records the opinion of the Apostle &lt;£ that he who patiently endures the cold of Al-Madinah and the heat of Meccah, merits a reward in Paradise.' Ice is not seen in the town, but may frequently be met with, it is said, on Jabal Ohod; fires are lighted in the houses during winter, and palsies attack those who at this season im prudently bathe in unwarmed water. The fair com plexions of the people prove that this account of the brumal rigours is not exaggerated. Chilly and violent winds from the Eastern Desert are much dreaded, and though Ohod screens the town on the North and North- East, a gap in the mountains to the North-West fills the 1 Burckhardt confounds the Ayn al-Zarka with the Bir al- Khatim, or Kuba well, of whose produce the surplus only mixes with it, and he complains loudly of the 'detestable water of Madinah.' But he was ill at the time, otherwise he would not have condemned it so strongly after eulogising the salt-bitter produce of the Meccan Zemzem.m, XVI 11.— Al 383 air at times with raw and comfortless blasts. The rains begin in October, and last with considerable intervals through six months; the clouds, gathered by the hill-tops and the trees near the town, discharge themselves with violence, and about the equinoxes, thunder-storms are common. At such times the Barr al-Manakhah, or the open space between the town and the suburbs, is a sheet of water, and the land near the Southern and the South- Eastern wall of the faubourg becomes a pool. Rain, how ever, is not considered unhealthy here; and the people, un like the Meccans and the Cairenes, expect it with pleasure, because it improves their date-trees and fruit planta tions. 1 In winter it usually rains at night, in spring during the morning, and in summer about evening time. This is the case throughout Al-Hijaz, as explained by the poet Labid in these lines, which describe the desolate site of an old encampment:— 'It (the place) hath been fertilised by the first spring showers of the constellations, and hath been swept by The incessant torrents of the thunder-clouds, falling in heavy and in gentle rains. From each night-cloud, and heavily dropping morning-cloud, And the even-cloud, whose crashings are re-echoed from around.' And the European reader will observe that the Arabs generally reckon three seasons, including our autumn, in their summer. The hot weather at Al-Madinah appeared to me as extreme as the hibernal cold is described to be, but the air was dry, and the open plain prevented the faint and stagnant sultriness which distinguishes Meccah. Moreover, though the afternoons were close, the nights and the mornings were cool and dewy. At this season the citizens sleep on the house-tops, or on the ground 1 The people of Nijd, as Wallin informs us, believe that the more the palms are watered, the more syrup will the fruit produce; they therefore inundate the ground, as often as possible. At Al-Jauf, where the date is peculiarly good, the trees are watered regularly every third or fourth day.384 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. outside their doors. Strangers must follow this example with considerable circumspection ; the open air is safe in the Desert, but in cities it causes, to the unaccustomed, violent catarrhs and febrile affections. I collect the following notes upon the diseases and medical treatment of the Northern Hijaz. Al-Madinah has been visited four times by the Rih al-Asfar 1 (yellow wind), or Asiatic Cholera, which is said to have com mitted great ravages, sometimes carrying off whole house holds. In the Rahmat al-Kabirah, the ' Great Mercy,' as the worst attack is piously called, whenever a man vomited, he was abandoned to his fate ; before that, he was treated with mint, lime-juice, and copious draughts of coffee. It is still the boast of Al-Madinah, that the Taun, or plague, has never passed her frontier. 2 The Judari, or smallpox, appears to be indigenous to the countries bordering upon the Red Sea ; we read of it there in the earliest works of the Arabs, 8 and even to the present time it sometimes sweeps through Arabia and the Somali 1 Properly meaning the Yellow Wind or Air. The antiquity of the word and its origin are still disputed. 2 Burckhardt (Travels in Arabi vol. ii.) informs us. that in a d. 1815, when Meccah, Yambu', and Jeddah suffered severely from the plague. Al-Madinah and the open country between the two sea- ports escaped. 3 Conjecture, however, goes a little too far when it discovers small-pox in the Tayr Ababil. the ' swallow birds.' which, according to the Koran, destroyed the host of Abrahat al-Ashram. Major Price (Essay) may be right in making Ababil the plural of Abilah, a vesicle; but it appears to me that the former is an Arabic and the latter a Persian word, which have no connection whatever. M. C. de Perceval, quoting the Sirat al-Rasul. which says that at that time small-pox first appeared in Arabia, ascribes the destruction of the host of Al-Yaman to an epidemic and a violent tempest. The strangest part of the story is, that although it occurred at Meccah, about two months before Mohammed's birth, and. therefore, within the memory of many living at the time, the Prophet alludes to it in the Koran as a miracle.Mmk How this e open aii the X VIII.— A ; ui «asesn 'i 32, Al-Maiu i al-Asfar 1 aid to e ' Great M® whenever a i before tint, ^piousdraDjlt iah, that the ]j r. 1 Thejt to the coiti of it therein en to the bia and the k Theandqiiiija I informs us, tk suffered severelji between thetw far when it fa'' rds,' which, at® at al-Ashram.

In the town of Al- Madinah it is fatal to children, many of whom, however, are in these days inoculated 1 : amongst the Badawin, old men die of it, but adults are rarely victims, either in the City or in the Desert. The nurse closes up the room whilst the sun is up, and carefully excludes the night air, believing that, as the disease is 'hot, 2 ' a breath of wind will kill the patient. During the hours of darkness, a lighted candle or lamp is always placed by the side of the bed, or the sufferer would die of madness, brought on by evil spirits or fright. Sheep's wool is burnt in the sick-room, as death would follow the inhaling of any perfume. The only remedy I have heard of is pounded Kohl (antimony) drunk in water, and the same is drawn along the breadth of the eyelid, to prevent blindness. The diet is Adas (lentils), 8 and a peculiar kind of date, called Tamr al-Birni. On the twenty-first day the patient is washed with salt and tepid water. Ophthalmia is rare. 4 In the summer, quotidian and 1 In Al-Yaman, we are told by Niebuhr. a rude form of inoculation— the mother pricking the child's arm with a thorn—has been known from time immemorial. My Madinah friend assured me that only during the last generation, this practice has been introduced amongst the Badawin of Al-Hijaz. 2 Orientals divide their diseases, as they do remedies and articles of diet, into hot, cold, and temperate. 3 This grain is cheaper than rice on the banks of the Nile—a fact which enlightened England, now paying a hundred times its value for ' Revalenta Arabica,' apparently ignores. 4 Herodotus (Euterpe) has two allusions to eye disease, which seems to have afflicted the Egyptians from the most ancient times. Sesostris the Great died stone-blind; his successor lost his sight for ten years, and the Hermaic books had reason to devote a whole volume to ophthalmic disease. But in the old days of idolatry, the hygienic and prophylactic practices alluded to by Herodotus, the greater clean liness of the people, and the attention paid to the canals and drainage, probably prevented this malarious disease becoming the scourge which it is now.

These are, the nitrous pel) antl and pungent nature of the soil—what the old Greek calls 'acrid jqiientlySfl matter exuding from the earth,'—and the sudden transition from ^stomach extreme dryness to excessive damp checking the invisible perspiration ^ of the circumorbital parts, and flying to an organ which is already | weakened by the fierce glare of the sun, and the fine dust raised by the Khamsin or the Chaliho. Glare and dust alone, seldom cause eye disease. Every one knows that ophthalmia is unknown in the Desert, and the people of Al-Hijaz, who live in an atmosphere of blaze and sand, seldom lose their sight. The Egyptian usually catches ophthal mia in his childhood. It begins with simple conjunctivitis, caused by constitutional predisposition, exposure, diet, and allowing the eye to be covered with swarms of flies. He neglects the early symptoms, and cares the less for being a Cyclops, as the infirmity will most probably exempt him from military service. Presently the sane organ becomes affected sympathetically. As before, simple disease of the conjunctiva passes into purulent ophthalmia. The man, after waiting a while, will go to the doctor and show a large cicatrix in p ? rVi eye, the result of an ulcerated cornea. Physic can do nothing for him; he remains blind for life. He is now provided for, either by living with his friends, who seldom refuse him a loaf of bread, or if industriously inclined, by begging, by acting Mu'ezzin. or by en gaging himself as 'Yamaniyah,' or chaunter, at funerals. His children are thus predisposed to the paternal complaint, and gradually the race becomes tender-eyed. Most travellers have observed that imported African slaves seldom become blind either in Egypt or in Sind. Few Englishmen settled in Egypt lose their sight, except they be medical men, who cannot afford time to nurse the early symptoms. The use of coffee and of water as beverages has much to do with this. In the days of hard drinking our Egyptian army suffered severely, and the Austrian army in Tuscany showed how often blindness is caused by importing Northern habits into Southern countries. Many Europeans in Egypt wash their eyes with cold water, especially a ter walking, and some use once a day a mildly astringent or cooling wash, as Goulard's lotion or vinegar and water. They avoid ^ letting flies settle upon their eyes, and are of opinion that the evening dews are prejudicial, and that sleeping with open windows lays the foundation of disease.

The principal remedies are cooling drinks, such as Sikanjabin (oxymel) and syrups. After the fever the face and body frequently swell, and indurated lumps appear on the legs and stomach. There are also low fevers, called simply Hummah ; they are usually treated by burning charms in the patient's room. Jaundice and bilious complaints are common, and the former is popularly cured in a peculiar way. The sick man looks into a pot full of water, whilst the exerciser, reciting a certain spell, draws the heads of two needles from the patient's ears along his eyes, down his face, lastly dipping them into water, which at once becomes yellow. Others have ' Mirayat,' magic mirrors, 1 on which the patient looks, and looses the com- to bathe and to wipe the eyes and forehead as a preparation for change of atmosphere. During my short practice in Egypt I found the greatest advantage from the employment of counter-irritants,— blisters and Pommade Emetise,—applied to the temples and behind the ears. Native practitioners greatly err by confining their patients in dark rooms, thereby injuring the general health and laying the foundation of chronic disease. They are ignorant that, unless the optic nerve be affected, the stimulus of light is beneficial to the eye. And the people by their dress favour the effects of glare and dust. The Tarbush, no longer surrounded as of old by a huge turband, is the least efficient of protectors, and the comparative rarity of ophthalmic disease among the women, who wear veils, proves that the exposure is one of its co-efficient causes. i This invention dates from the most ancient times, and both in the East and in the West has been used by the weird brotherhood to produce the appearances of the absent and the dead, to discover treasure, to detect thieves, to cure disease, and to learn the secrets of the unknown world. The Hindus called it Anjan. and formed it by applying lamp-black, made of a certain root, and mixed with oil to the palm of a footling child, male or female. The Greeks used oil poured into a boy's hand. Cornelius Agrippa had a crystal mirror, which material also served the Counts de Saint Germain and Cagliostro. Dr. Dee's ' show-stone ' was a bit of cannel coal. The modern Sindians know the art by the name of Gahno or Vinyano; there, as in Southern Persia, ink is rubbed upon the seer's thumb-nail.

In selecting subjects to hold the ink, they | dietetic observe the right hand, and reject all who have not what is called in Jjyrobalai palmistry the 'linea media naturalis' straight and deeply cut. Even the barbarous Finns look into a glass of brandy, and the natives £ of Australia gaze at a kind of shining stone. Lady Blessmgton s crystal ball is fresh in the memory of the present generation, and most men tmai haveheard of Electro-Biology and the Cairo magician. Upon this latter mnion! subject a vexed one, I must venture a few remarks. In the first itYambl account of the magician by Mr. Lane, we have a fair and dispassionate • recital of certain magical, mystical, or mesmeric phenomena, whic ' excited considerable curiosity and interest thoeghout the avd«d world •' As usual in such matters, the civilised world was wholly le wort ignorant of what was going on at home; otherwise, in London, Paris, ro and New York, they might have found dozens studying the science. ^ ^ But a few years before. Dr. Herklots had described the sam ® jpjg in India, filling three goodly pages ; but he called his work Qanoon- i -Islam ' and. consequently, despite its excellencies, it fell s 1 - or from the press. Lady H.

According 7' in ; 1844. Mr. Lane, aided by Lord Nugent and others, discovered that a •&lt; coarse and stupid fraud ' had been perpetrated upon him by Osman A1 . HlJa , Effendi. the Scotchman. In 1845. Sir G.

The popular treat ment is by the actual cautery; the scientific affect the use of drastics and astringent simples, and the Bizr al-Kutn (cotton-seed), toasted, pounded, and drunk in warm water. Almost every one here, as in Egypt, suffers more or less from haemorrhoids ; they are treated by dietetics—eggs and leeks—and by a variety of drugs, Myrobalans, Lisan-al-Hamal (Arnoglossum), etc. But the patient looks with horror at the scissors and the knife, so that they seldom succeed in obtaining a radical cure. The Filaria Medinensis, locally called ' Farantit,' is no longer common at the place which gave it its European name. At Yambu', however, the people suffer much from the Vena appearing in the legs. The complaint is treated here as in India and in Abyssinia: when the tumour bursts, and the worm shows, it is extracted by being gradually wound round a splinter of wood. Hydrophobia is rare, and the people have many superstitions about it. They suppose that a bit of meat falls from the sky, and that a dog eating it becomes mad. I was assured by respectable persons, that when a man is bitten, they shut him up with food, in a solitary chamber, for four days, and that if at the end of that time he still howls like a dog, they expel the Ghijl (demon) from him, by pouring over him boiling water mixed with ashes—a certain cure I can easily believe. The only description of leprosy known in Al-Hijaz is that called 'Al-Baras': it appears in white patches on the skin, seldom attacks any but the poorer classes, and is considered incurable. Wounds are treated by Marham, or ointments, especially by the 'Balesan,' or Balm of Meccah; a cloth is tied round the limb, and magic to be an ' affair of mesmerism.' Melancholy to relate, after all this philosophy, the herd of travellers at Cairo is still divided in opinion about the magician, some holding his performance to be ' all humbug,' others darkly hinting that ' there may be something in it.'■ 390 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. not removed till the wound heals, which amongst this people of simple life, generally takes place by first inten tion. Ulcers are common in Al-Hijaz, as indeed all over Arabia. We read of them in ancient times. In a.d. 504, the poet and warrior, Amr al-Kays, died of this dreadful disease, and it is related that when Mohammed Abu Si Mohammed, in a.h. 132, conquered Al-Yaman with an army from Al-Hijaz, he found the people suffering from sloughing and mortifying sores, so terrible to look upon that he ordered the sufferers to be burnt alive. Fortunately for the patients, the conqueror died suddenly before his inhuman mandate was executed. These sores here, as in Al-Yaman, 1 are worst when upon the shin bones; they eat deep into the leg, and the patient dies of fever and gangrene. They are treated on first ap pearance by the actual cautery, and, when practicable, by cutting off the joint; the drugs popularly applied are Tutiya (tutty) and verdigris. There is no cure but rest, a generous diet, and change of air. By the above short account it will be seen that the Arabs are no longer the most skilful physicians in the world. They have, however, one great advantage in their practice, and they are sensible enough to make free use of it. As the children of almost all the respectable citizens are brought up in the Desert, the camp becomes to them a native village. In cases of severe wounds or chronic diseases, the patient is ordered off to the Black Tents, where he lives as a Badawi, drinking camels' milk (a diet for the first three or four days highly cathartic), and doing nothing. This has been the practice from time immemorial in Arabia, whereas Europe is only beginning to systematise the adhibition of air, exercise, and simple living. And even now we are obliged to veil it under the garb of charlatanry—to call it a 'milk-cure' in Switzer- 1 They distinguish, however, between the Hijaz'Nasur' and the ' Jurh al-Yamani,' or the ' Yaman Ulcer.'Mtcal as -w.

Al-Madinah consists of three parts,—a town, a fort, and a suburb little smaller than the body of the place. The town itself is about one-third larger than Suez, or nearly half the size of Meccah. It is a walled enclosure forming an irregular oval with four gates. The Bab al-Shami, or 'Syrian Gate,' in the North-West side of the enceinte, l eads towards Jabal Ohod, Hamzah's burial-place, and the mountains. In the Eastern wall, the Bab al-Jum'ah, or Friday Gate, opens upon the Nijd road and the cemetery, Al-Bakia. Between the Shami and the Jum'ah gates, towards the North, is the Bab al-Ziyafah (of Hospitality); and Westwards the Bab al-Misri (Egyptian) opens upon the plain called the Barr al-Manakhah. The Eastern and the Egyptian gates are fine massive buildings, with double towers close together, painted with broad bands of red, yellow, and other colors, not unlike that old entrance of the Cairo citadel which opens upon the Ramayliyah plain. They may be compared with the gateway towers of the old Norman castles — Arques, for instance. In their shady and well-watered interiors, soldiers keep guard, camel-men dispute, and numerous idlers congregate, to enjoy the luxuries of coolness and of companionship. Be yond this gate, in the street leading to the Mosque, is the great bazar. Outside it lie the Suk al-Khuzayriyah, or greengrocers' market, and the Suk al-Habbabah, or the grain bazar, with a fair sprinkling of coffee-houses. These markets are long masses of palm-leaf huts, blackened in the sun and wind, of a mean and squalid appearance, detracting greatly from the appearance of the gates. Amongst them there is a little domed and whitewashed building, which I was told is a Sabil or public fountain. In the days of the Prophet the town392 Pilgrimage toAl-Mcidiiiah Meccah. was not walled. Even in Al-Idrisi's time (twelfth cer tury), and as late as Bartema's (eighteenth century), tl J fortifications were mounds of earth, made by order *«| Kasim al-Daulat al-Ghori, who re-populated the to | and provided for its inhabitants.

Inside, the streets are wha they always should be in these torrid lands, deep, darl and narrow, in few places paved—a thing to be deprecatd —and generally covered with black earth well watereii and trodden to hardness. The most considerable line radiate towards the Mosque. There are few public build ings. The principal Wakalahs are four in number one is the Wakalat Bab Salam near the Harim, anothe the Wakalat Jabarti, and two are inside the Misri gate they all belong to Arab citizens. These Caravanserai are used principally as stores, rarely for dwelling-place like those of Cairo; travellers, therefore, must hire house at a considerable expense, or pitch tents to the detrimei of health and to their extreme discomfort. The oth( public buildings are a few mean coffee-houses and a excellent bath in the Harat Zarawan, inside the town far superior to the unclean establishments of Cairo, i borrows something from the luxury of Stambul. Th houses are, for the East, well built, flat-roofed and double storied; the materials generally used are a basaltic scori : burnt brick, and palm wood.

Al-Madinah fell rapidly [ under the Wahhabis, but after their retreat, it soon rose again, and now it is probably as comfortable and flourish- i ing a little city as any to be found in the East. It contains between fifty and sixty streets, including the alleys and I culs-de-sac. There is about the same number of Harat or quarters; but I have nothing to relafe of them save their [names. Within the town few houses are in a dilapidated | condition. The best authorities estimate the number of habitations at about 1500 within the enceinte, and those bin the suburb at 1000. I consider both accounts exag gerated; the former might contain 800, and the Manakhah perhaps 500; at the same time I must confess not to have counted them, and Captain Sadlier (in a.d. 1819) de clares that the Turks, who had just made a kind of census, reckoned 6000 houses and a population of 18,000 1 souls. Assuming the population to be 16,000 (Burck- hardt raises it as high as 20,000), of which 9000 occupy j the city, and 7000 the suburbs and the fort, this would give a little more than twelve inhabitants to each house, a fair estimate for an Arab town, where the abodes are large and slaves abound. 1 The castle joins on to the North-West angle of the city enceinte, and the wall of its Eastern outwork is pierced for 1 I afterwardsreceived the following information from Mr. Charles j Cole, H.B.M.

Meccah contains about 45,000 inhabitants, Yambu' | from 6000 to 7000, Jeddah about 2500 (this I think is too low), and Taif 8000. Most, of the troops are stationed at Meccah and at Jeddah.

The outer wall resembles that of the city, only ^ 110 its towers are more solid, and the curtain appears better jjf ir ce calculated for work. Inside, a donjon, built upon a rock, e . , bears proudly enough the banner of the Crescent and the , 6 ^ ^ Star ; its whitewashed walls make it a conspicuous object, im ' e ° ng ' y and guns pointed in all directions, especially upon the su ur s ^ CU P' town, project from their embrasures.

Southwards they are separated from the enceinte by a wide road, called the Darb al-Janazah, the Road of Biers, so called because the corpses of certain schismatics, who may not pass through the city, are carried this way to their own cemetery near the Bab al-Jumah, or Eastern Gate. Westwards, between Al-Madinah and its faubourg, lies the plain of Al-Manakhah, about three-quarters of a mile long, by three hundred yards broad. The straggling suburbs occupy more ground than the city : fronting the enceinte they are without walls; towards the West, where open country lies, they are enclosed by mud or raw brick ramparts, with little round towers, all falling to decay. A number of small gates lead from the suburb into the country. Ihe only large one, a poor copy of the Bab al-Nasr at Caii'o, is the Ambari or Western entrance, through which we passed into Al-Madinah. The suburb contains no buildings of any consequence, except the Khaskiyah, or official residence of the Muhafiz (governor), a plain building near the Barr al-Manakhah, and the Khamsah Masajid, or the Five Mosques, which every Zair is expected to visit. They are The Prophet's Mosque in the Manakhah. Abu Bakr's near the Ayn al-Zarka. Ali s Mosque in the Zukak al-Tayyar of the Manakhah. Some authors call this the ' Musalla al-Id,' because the Prophet here prayed the Festival Prayer. Omar's Mosque, near the Bab Kuba of the Manak hah, and close to the little torrent called Al-Sayh. Belal's Mosque, celebrated in books; I did not see it, and some Madani assured me that it no longer exists. A description of one of these buildings will suffice, for they are all similar, Mohammed's Mosque in the Manakhah stands upon a spot formerly occupied, some say, by the Jami Ghamamah. Others believe it to be founded upon the Musalla al-Nabi, a place where thePilgvwtcigc to A l-Mctdiucih ctud Mccccth* Apostle recited the first Festival prayers after his arrival at Al-Madinah, and used frequently to pray, and to address those of his followers who lived far from the Harim, 1 or Sanctuary. It is a trim modern building of cut stone and lime in regular layers, of parallelogramic shape, surmounted by one large and four small cupolas. These are all whitewashed; and the principal is capped with a large crescent, or rather a trident, rising from a series of gilt globes: the other domes crown the several corners. The minaret is of the usual Turkish shape, with a conical roof, and a single gallery for the Mu'ezzin. _ An Acacia- tree or two on the Eastern side, and behind it a wall-like line of mud houses, finish the the interior of this building is as simple as is the exterior. And here I may remark that the Arabs have little idea of splendour, either in their public or in their private architecture. Whatever strikes the traveller's eye in Al-Hijazis always either an importation or the work of foreign artists. This arises from the simple tastes of the people, combined, doubtless, with their notable thriftiness. If strangers will build for them, they argue, why should they build for themselves ? Moreover, they have scant inducement to lavish money upon grand edifices. Whenever a dis turbance takes place, domestic or from without, the principal buildings are sure to suffer. And the climate is inimical to their enduring. Both ground and air at A - Madinah, as well as at Meccah, are damp and nitrous in winter, in summer dry and torrid : the lime is poor; palm- timber soon decays: even foreign wood-work suffers, and a few years of neglect suffice to level the proudest pile with the dust. .

These enclosures contain the cattle of the inhabitants; they have strong wooden doors, shut at night to prevent 'lifting,' and they are capable of being stoutly defended. The inhabitants of the suburb are for the most part Badawi settlers, and a race of schismatics who will be noticed in another chapter. Beyond these suburbs, to the South, as well as to the North and North east, lie gardens and extensive plantations of palm-trees.CHAPTER XIX. a ride to the mosque of kuba. The principal places of pious visitation in the vicinity of Al-Madinah are the Mosques of Kuba, the Cemetery Al-Bakia, and the martyr Hamzah's tomb, at the foot of Mount Ohod. These the Zair is directed by all the Olema to visit, and on the holy ground to pray Allah for a blessing upon himself, and upon his brethren of the faith. Early one Saturday morning, I started for Kuba with a motley crowd of devotees. Shaykh Hamid, my Muzaw- wir, was by my side, mounted upon an ass more miserable than I had yet seen. The boy Mohammed had procured for me a Meccan dromedary, with splendid trappings, a saddle with burnished metal peaks before and behind, covered with a huge sheepskin died crimson, and girthed over fine saddle-bags, whose enormous tassels hung almost to the ground. The youth himself, being too grand to ride a donkey, and unable to borrow a horse, preferred walking. He was proud as a peacock, being habited in a style somewhat resembling the plume of that gorgeous bird, in the coat of many colours—yellow, red, and golden flowers, apparently sewed on a field of bright green silk—which cost me so dear in the Harim. He was armed, as indeed all of us were, in readiness for the Badawin, and he anxiously awaited opportunities of dis charging his pistol.

Outside the town, in this direction. South ward, is a plain of clay, mixed with chalk, and here and there with sand, whence protrude blocks and little ridges of basalt. As far as Kuba, and the Harrah ridge to the West, the earth is sweet and makes excellent gugglets. 1 Immediately outside the gate I saw a kiln, where they were burning tolerable bricks. Shortly after leaving the suburb, an Indian, who joined our party upon the road, pointed out on the left of the way what he declared was the place of the celebrated Khandak, or Moat, the Torres Vedras of Arabian History. 2 Presently the Nakhil, or palm plantations, began. Nothing lovelier to the eye, weary with hot red glare, than the rich green waving crops and the cool shade, the 'food of vision,' as the Arabs call it, and 'pure water to the parched throat.' For hours I could have sat and looked at it. The air was soft and balmy; a perfumed breeze, strange luxury in Al-Hijaz, wandered amongst the date fronds; there were fresh flowers and bright foliage; in fact, at Midsummer, every beautiful feature of Spring. Nothing more delightful to the ear than the warbling of the small birds, that sweet familiar sound; the splashing of tiny cascades from the wells into the wooden troughs, 1 The Baradiyah or gugglets of Al-Madinah are large and heavy, of a reddish-grey colour, and celebrated for cooling water, a property not possessed by those of Meccan fabric. 2 I afterwards found reason to doubt this location. Ibn Jubayr (12th century), places it an arrow-shot from the Westward wall of Al- Madinah, and seems to have seen it. M. C. de Perceval states, I know not upon whose authority, that it was dug to protect the North west, the North, and the North-eastern sides of the town: this is rendered highly improbable by the features of the ground. The learned are generally agreed that all traces of the moat had disap- peared before our 15th century.400 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah and the musical song of the water-wheels. Travellers— young travellers—in the East talk of the ' dismal grating,' the ' mournful monotony,' and the ' melancholy creaking of these dismal machines.' To the veteran wanderer their sound is delightful from association, reminding him of fields and water-courses, and hospitable villages, and plentiful crops. The expatriated Nubian, for instance, listens to the water-wheel with as deep emotion as the Ranz desVaches ever excited in the hearts of Switzer mercenary at Naples, or ' Lochaber no more,' among a regiment of Highlanders in the West Indies. The date-trees of Al-Madinah merit their celebrity. Their stately columnar stems, here, seems higher than in other lands, and their lower fronds are allowed to tremble in the breeze without mutilation. 1 These enormous palms were loaded with ripening fruits ; and the clusters, carefully tied up, must often have weighed upwards of eighty pounds. They hung down between the lower branches by a bright yellow stem, as thick as a man's ankle. Books enumerate a hundred and thirty-nine varie ties of trees; of these between sixty and seventy are well known, and each is distinguished, as usual among Arabs, by its peculiar name. The best kind is Al-Shelebi; it is packed in skins, or in flat round boxes covered with paper, somewhat in the manner of French prunes, and sent as presents to the remotest parts of the Moslem world. 2 The fruit is about two inches long, with a small stone, 1 In Egypt, the lower branches of the date are lopped off about Christmas time to increase the flavour of the fruit; and the people believe that without this ••Taklim,' as it is called, the tree would die. In Upper Egypt, however, as at Al-Madinah, the fronds are left un touched. 2 The visitor from Al-Madinah would be badly received by the women of his family, if he did not present them on his return with a few boxes of dates, some strings of the same fruit, and skins full of henna powder. Even the Olema allow such articles to be carried away, although they strictly forbid keepsakes of earth or stone. and has a ] eaten by varies froi moreover, the other i because a breaketh . fruits, nee kind, Al-1 from its e: relate th: few minv Al-Birni, depart, ai one occas as he ate turns ea because 1 happene( the Prin Pious, a: Of cour; hold hig were in i the stom named I ripe; it; is the co 1 This of dates, ■ Ajwah. 1 Cairo, dec particular] 2 So i Superstitu VOL i.i ' s '. tenets, 1 dismal ftatiit' veteran reminding! ible villages, a] | ' ai1 ) for inst®, : P emotion as fc hearts of Siila ) more,' amoij! idies. it their celetrlj ms higher thii These ; and thecta 3tween the k thick as a mi : 1 thirty-nine ra d seventy aien' ual among M s Al-Shelebi;it nines, and sat: e Moslem it vith a ! are fruit; ed, the tree wis the fronds®'-- badly receiv monhisreti inut,an(l articles to ^ XIX.—A Ride to th Mosque 401 and has a peculiar aromatic flavour and smell; it is seldom eaten by the citizens on account of the price, which varies from two to ten piastres the pound. The tree, moreover, is rare, and is said to be not so productive as the other species. The Ajwah 1 date is eaten, but not sold, because a tradition of the Prophet declares, that whoso breaketh his fast every day with six or seven of these fruits, need fear neither poison nor magic. The third kind, Al-Hilwah, also a large date, derives a name from its exceeding sweetness : of this palm the Moslems relate that the Prophet planted a stone, which in a few minutes grew up and bore fruit. Next comes Al-Birni, of which was said, 'It causeth sickness to depart, and there is no sickness in it.' The Wahshi on one occasion bent its head, and 'salamed' to Mohammed as he ate its fruit, for which reason even now its lofty tuft turns earthwards. The Sayhani (Crier) is so called, because when the founder of Al-Islam, holding Ali's hand, happened to pass beneath, it cried, ' This is Mohammed the Prince of Prophets, and this is Ali the Prince of the Pious, and the Progenitor of the Immaculate Imams. 2 ' Of course the descendants of so intelligent a vegetable hold high rank in the kingdom of palms, and the vulgar were in the habit of eating the Sayhani and of throwing the stones about the Harim. The Khuzayriyah is thus named because it preserves its green colour, even when ripe ; it is dried and preserved as a curiosity. The Jabali is the common fruit: the poorest kinds are the Laun and 1 This fruit must not be confounded with the enucleated conserve of dates, which in Arabia, as in Egypt, is known by the name of Ajwah. The Arabs infinitely despise the stuff sold at Alexandria and Cairo, declaring that it is fit only for cows. The Ajwah of the Oases, particularly of Siwah, is of excellent quality. 2 So in a.d. 1272 the Crucifix spoke to St. Thomas Aquinas. Superstitions are of no age or country. vol 1. 26402 PilgmMge toAl-Madinah the Hilayah, costing from four to seven piastres per mudd. 1 I cannot say that the dates of Al-Madinah are finer than those of Meccah, although it is highly heretical to hold such tenet. The produce of the former city was the favourite food of the Prophet, who invariably broke his fast with it : a circumstance which invests it with a certain degree of relic-sanctity. The citizens delight in speaking of dates as an Irishman does of potatoes, with a manner of familiar fondness: they eat them for medicine ao well as for food; ' Rutab,' or wet dates, being held to be the most saving, as it is doubtless the most savoury, of remedies. The fruit is prepared in a great variety of ways : the favourite dish is a broil with clarified butter, extremely distasteful to the European palate. The date is also left upon the tree to dry, and then called ' Balah . this is eaten at dessert as the ' Nukliyat '—the mendiants of Persia. Amongst peculiar preparations must be mentioned the ' Kulladat al-Sham 2 ' (necklace of Sham). The unripe fruit is dipped in boiling water to preserve its ^ gamboge colour, strung upon a thick thread and hung out in the air to dry.

The ' Nakhwali,' as he is called, opens the female flower, and having inserted the inverted male blossom, binds them together : this operation is performed, as in Egypt, upon each cluster. 2 The fruit is ripe about the middle of May, and the gathering of it forms the Arabs' ' vendemmia.' The people make merry the more readily because their favourite diet is liable to a variety of accidents : droughts injure the tree, locusts destroy the produce, and the date crop, like most productions which men are imprudent enough to adopt singly as the staff of life, is often subject to complete failure. One of the reasons for the excellence of Madinah dates is the quantity of water they obtain : each garden or field has its well; and even in the hottest weather the Persian wheel floods the soil every third day. It has been observed that the date-tree can live in dry and barren spots; but it loves the beds of streams and places where moisture is procurable. The palms scattered over the other parts of the plain, and depending solely upon rain water, produce less fruit, and that too of an inferior quality. Verdure is not usually wholesome in Arabia, yet invalids leave the close atmosphere of Al-Madinah to seek health under the cool shades of Kuba. The gardens are divided by what might almost be called lanes, long narrow lines with tall reed fences on both sides. The graceful branches of the Tamarisk, pearled with manna, and cot toned over with dew, and the broad leaves of the castor plant, glistening in the sun, protected us from the morning 1 This is a translation of the Arab word ' Tazkir,' which is cer tainly more appropriate than our ' caprification ' applied to dates. 2 The male tree is known by its sterility. In some countries only the fecundating pollen is scattered over the female flower, and this doubtless must have been Nature's method of impregnating the date.404 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah rays.

Little can be said in favour of the fruit, which has been compared successively by disappointed ' Lotus eaters 2 ' to a bad plum, an unripe cherry, and an insipid apple. It is, however, a favourite with the people of Al-Madinah, who have reckoned many varieties of the fruit : Hindi (Indian), Baladi ('native'), Tamri (date-like), and others. There are a few peaches, hard like the Egyptian, and almost tasteless, fit only for stewing, but greedily eaten in a half-ripe state ; large coarse bananas, lime trees, a few water-melons, figs, and apples, but neither apricots nor pears. 8 There are three kinds of pomegranates : the best is the Shami (Syrian) ; it is red outside, very sweet, and costs one piastre : the Turki is large, and of a white colour : and the Misri has a greenish rind, and a somewhat sub-acid and harsh flavour ; the latter are sold at one-fourth the price of the best. I never saw in the East, except at Meccah, finer fruits than the Shami : almost stoneless like those of Maskat, they are delicately perfumed, and as large as an infant's head. Al-Madinah is celebrated, like Taif, for its ' Rubb Rumman,' a thick pomegranate syrup, drunk 1 This thorn (the Rhamnus Nabeca, or Zizyphus Spina Christi) is supposed to be that which crowned the Saviour's head.

These 'Houris of Jahannam' were habited in long night-gowns dyed blue to conceal want of washing, and the squalid children had about a yard of the same material wrapped round their waists for all toilette. This is not an overdrawn portrait of the farmer race of Arabs, the most despised by their fellow-countrymen, and the most hard-favoured, morally as well as physically, of all the breed. Before entering the Mosque of Al-Kuba 1 it will be necessary to call to mind some passages of its past his tory. When the Apostle's she-camel, Al-Kaswa, as he was approaching Al-Madinah after the flight from Meccah, knelt down here, he desired his companions to mount the animal. Abu Bakr and Omar 2 did so ; still she sat upon the ground; but when Ali obeyed the order, she arose. The Apostle bade him loose her halter, for she was directed by Allah, and the Mosque walls were built upon the line over which she trod. It was the first place of public prayer in Al-Islam. Mohammed laid the first brick, and with an ' Anzah,' or iron-shod javelin, marked out the direction of prayer 8 : each of his successors fol lowed his example. According to most historians, the 1 I believe Kuba to be about three miles S. S. E. of Al-Madinah ; but Al-Idrisi, Ibn Haukal, and Ibn Jubayr all agree in saying two miles. 2 Osman, the fourth Companion, was absent at this time, not having returned from the first or Little Flight to Abyssinia. 3 Some believe that in this Mosque the direction of prayer was altered from Jerusalem to Meccah, and they declare, as will presently be seen, that the Archangel Gabriel himself pointed out the new line. M. C. de Perceval forgets his usual accuracy when he asserts 14 le Mihrab de la Mosquee de Medine, qui fut d'abord place au Nord, fut transfere au Midi: et la Mosquee prit le nom de 1 Masjid-el-Kiblatayn,' Mosqu^e des deux Kiblah.' In the first place, the Mihrab is the in vention of a later date, about ninety years; and, secondly, the title of Al-Kiblatyn is never now given to the Mosque of Al-Madinah #408 Pilgrimage to Al -Madinah land belonged to Abu Ayyub the Ansari, the Apostle's host; for which reason the 'Bayt Ayyub,' his descen dants, still perform the service of the Mosque, keep the key, and share with the Bawwabs, or porters, the alms and fees here offered by the Faithful. Others declared that the ground was the property of one Linah, a woman who was in the habit of tethering her ass there. 1 The Apostle used to visit it every Saturday 2 on foot, and always made a point of praying the dawn-prayer there on the 17th Ramazan. 8 A number of traditions testify to its dignity: of these, two are especially significant. The first assures all Moslems that a prayer at Kuba is equal to a Lesser Pilgrimage at Meccah in religious efficacy; and the second declares that such devotion is more ac ceptable to the Deity than prostrations at the Bayt al- Mukuddas (Jerusalem). Moreover, sundry miracles took place here, and a verset of the Koran descended from heaven. For which reasons the Mosque was much respected by Omar, who, once finding it empty, swept it himself with a broom of thorns, and expressed his wonder at the lukewarmness of Moslem piety. It was originally a square building of very small size ; Osman enlarged it in the direction of the minaret, making it sixty-six cubits each way. It is no longer 'mean and decayed' as in Burckhardt's time: the Sultan Abd al-Hamid, father of 1 This degrading report caused certain hypocrites to build a Kind of rival chapel called the Mosque Zarar. It was burnt to the ground shortly after its erection, and all known of it is, that it stood near Kuba. 2 Some say on Monday, probably because on that day Mohammed alighted at Kuba. But the present practice of Al-Islam, handed down from generation to generation, is to visit it on the Saturday. 3 There is on this day at Kuba a regular Ziyarat or visitation. The people pray in the Harim of Al-Madinah, after which they re pair to the Kuba Mosque, and go through the ceremonies which in religious efficacy equal an Umrah or Lesser pilgrimage.

XIX.—A Ride to t 409 the Sultan Mahmud, erected a minaret of Turkish shape and a neat structure of cut stone, whose crenelles make it look more like a place of defence than of prayer. It has, however, no pretentions to grandeur. To the South a small and narrow Riwak (porch), with unpretending columns, looks out Northwards upon a little open area simply sanded over; and this is the whole building. The large Mastabah or stone bench at the entrance of the Mosque was crowded with sitting people : we there fore lost no time, after ablution and the Niyat ('the Intention ') peculiar to this Visitation, in ascending the steps, in pulling off our slippers, and in entering the sacred building. We stood upon the Musalla al-Nabi (the Prophet's place of Prayer) 1 : after Shaykh Nur and Hamid had forcibly cleared that auspicious spot of a devout In dian, and had spread a rug upon the dirty matting, we performed a two-bow prayer, in front of a pillar into which a diminutive marble Mihrab or niche had been inserted by way of memento. Then came the Dua, or supplica tion, which was as follows : ' O Allah ! bless and preserve, and increase, and per petuate, and benefit, and be propitous to, our Lord Moham med, and to his Family, and to his Companions, and be Thou their Preserver ! O Allah! this is the Mosque Kuba, and the Place of the Prophet's Prayers. O Allah ! pardon our Sins, and veil our Faults, and place not over us one who ( feareth not Thee, and who pitieth not us, and pardon us, and the true Believers, Men and Women, the Quick of them and the Dead : for verily Thou, O Lord, art the Hearer, the near to us, the Answerer of our Supplications.' After which we recited the Testification and the Fatihah, and we drew our palms as usual down our faces. We then moved away to the South-Eastern corner of the edifice, and stood before a Mihrab in the Southern wall. 1 This is believed to be the spot where the Prophet performed his first Rukat, or prayer-bow.410 Pilgrimage to A l-Madinah Meccah. It is called ' Takat al-Kashf ' or ' Niche of Disclosure,' by those who believe that as the Prophet was standing undecided about the direction of Meccah, the Archangel Gabriel removed all obstructions to his vision. There again we went through the two-bow prayer, the Supplica tion, the Testification, and the Fatihah, under difficulties, for people mobbed us excessively. During our devotions, I vainly attempted to decipher a Cufic inscription fixed in the wall above and on the right of the Mihrab,—my regret however, at this failure was transitory, the character not being of an ancient date. Then we left the Riwak, and despite the morning sun which shone fiercely with a sickly heat, we went to the open area where stands the ' Mabrak al-Nakah,' or the ' Place of kneeling of the she-Drome dary. 1 '* This, the exact spot where Al-Kaswa sat down, is covered with a diminutive dome of cut stone, supported by four stone pillars : the building is about eight feet high and a little less in length and in breadth. It has the appearance of being modern. On the floor, which was raised by steps above the level of the ground, lay, as usual, a bit of dirty matting, upon which we again went through the ceremonies above detailed. Then issuing from the canopy into the sun, a little out side the Riwak and close to the Mabrak, we prayed upon the ' Makan al-Ayat, 2 ,' or the ' Place of Signs.' Here was revealed to Mohammed a passage in the Koran especially alluding to the purity of the place and of the people of Kuba, ' a Temple founded in Purity from its first Day ;' and again : ' there live Men who love to be 1 ' Mabrak ' is the locative noun from the triliteral root 'Baraka—he blessed, or he (the camel) knelt upon the ground.' Perhaps this philological connection may have determined Moham med to consider the kneeling of the dromedary a sign that Allah had blessed.the spot. 2 'Ayat' here means a verset of the Koran.

' when the people offered him an explanation of their personal cleanliness which I do not care to repeat. The temple of Kuba from that day took a fresh title— Masjid al-Takwa, or the ' Mosque of Piety.' Having finished our prayers and ceremonies at the Mosque of Piety, we fought our way out through a crowd of importunate beggars, and turning a few paces to the left, halted near a small chapel adjoining the South-West angle of the larger temple. We there stood at a grated window in the Western wall, and recited a Supplication, looking the while reverently at a dark dwarf archway under which the Lady Fatimah used to sit grinding grain in a hand-mill. The Mosque in consequence bears the name of Sittna Fatimah. A surly-looking Khadim, or guardian stood at the door demanding a dollar in the most authoritative Arab tone—we therefore did not enter. At Al-Madinah and at Meccah the traveller's hand must be perpetually in his pouch: no stranger in Paris or in London is more surely or more severely taken in. Already I began to fear that my eighty pounds would not suffice for all the expenses of sight-seeing, and the apprehension was justified by the sequel. My only friend was the boy Mohammed, who displayed a fiery economy that brought him into considerable disrepute with his countrymen. They saw with emotion that he was preaching parsimony to me solely that I might have more money to spend at Meccah under his auspices. This being palpably the case, I threw all the blame of penuriousness upon the young Machiavel's shoulders, and resolved, as he had taken charge of my finances at Al-Madinah, so at Meccah to administer them myself. After praying at the window, to the great disgust of the Khadim, who openly asserted that we were ' low412 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah fellows,' we passed through some lanes lined with beggars and Badawi children, till we came to a third little Mosque situated due South of the larger one. This is called the Masjid Arafat, and is erected upon a mound also named Tall Arafat, because on one occasion the Prophet, being unable to visit the Holy Mountain at the pilgrimage season, stood there, saw through the intervening space, and in spirit performed the ceremony. Here also we looked into a window instead of opening the door with a silver key, and the mesquin appearance of all within prevented my regretting the necessity of economy. In India or in Sind every village would have a better Mosque. Our last visit was to a fourth chapel, the Masjid Ali, so termed because the Apostle's son-in-law had a house upon this spot. 1 After praying there—and terribly hot the little hole was !—we repaired to the last place of visitation at Kuba—a large deep well called the Bir al-Aris, in a garden to the West of the Mosque of Piety, with a little oratory adjoining it. A Persian wheel was going drowsily round, and the cool water fell into a tiny pool, whence it whirled and bubbled away in childish mimicry of a river. The music sounded sweet in my ears ; I stubbornly refused to do any more praying—though Shaykh Hamid,for form's sake, reiterated with parental emphasis, ' how very wrong it was,'—and I sat down, as the Prophet himself did not disdain to do, with the resolution of enjoying on the brink of the well a few moments of unwonted ' Kayf.' The heat was over powering, though it was only nine o'clock, the sound of the stream was soothing, that water-wheel was creaking a lullaby, and the limes and pomegranates, gently rustling, shed voluptuous fragrance through the morning air. I fell asleep, and—wondrous the contrast!—dreamed that I was once more standing 41 By the wall whereon hangeth the cruci fied vine/* i Ibn Jubayr informs us that Abu Bakr, Ayishah, and Omar had habitations at Kuba.XIX.— A Ride to t 413 looking upon the valley of the Lianne, with its glaucous seas and grey skies, and banks here and there white with snow. The Bir al-Aris^so called after a Jew of Al-Madinah, is one which the Apostle delighted to visit. He would sit upon its brink with his bare legs hanging over the side, and his companions used to imitate his example. This practice caused a sad disaster. In the sixth year of his caliphate, Osman, according to Abulfeda and Yakut, dropped from his finger the prophetic ring which, engraved in three lines with 'Mohammed—Apostle—(of) Allah,' had served to seal the letters sent to neighbouring kings, and had descended to the first three successors. 4 The precious article was not recovered after three days 1 search, and the well was thenceforward called Bir al-Khatim—of the Seal Ring. It is also called the Bir al-Taflat—of Saliva 8 —because the Prophet honoured it by expectoration, as, by-the-bye, he seems to have done to almost all the wells in Al-Madinah. The effect of the operation upon the Bir al-Aris, says the historians, was to sweeten the water, which before was salt. Their testimony, however, did not prevent my detecting a pronounced medicinal taste in the lukewarm draught drawn for me by Shaykh Hamid. In Mohammed's days the total number of wells is recorded to 1 Some authors mention a second Bir al-Aris, belonging in part to the Caliph Osman. According to Yakut, 'Aris' is the Hebrew or Syriac word for a peasant; he quotes the plural form Arisun and Ararisah. 2 Others assert, with less probability, that the article in question was lost by one Ma'akah, a favourite of Osman. As that ill-fated Caliph's troubles began at the time of this accident, the ring is gener ally compared to Solomon's. Our popular authors, who assert that Mohammed himself lost the ring, are greatly in error. 3 According to some authors, Mohammed drew a bucket of water, drank part of the contents, spat into the rest, and poured it back into the well, which instantly became sweet. Ibn Jubayr applies the epithet Bir AI-Taflat peculiarly to the Aris well: many other authors are not so exact.414 Pilgyimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. have been twenty : most of them have long since disap peared ; but there still remain seven, whose waters were drunk by the Prophet, and which, in consequence, the Zair is directed to visit. 1 They are known by the classical title of Saba Abar, or the seven wells, and their names are included in this couplet : ,, Aris and Ghars, and Rumah and Buza^t And Busat, with Bayruha and Ihn.' 2 1 The pious perform the Lesser Ablution upon the brink of the seven wells, and drink of the remnant of the water in 11 Tabarruk ' or to secure the blessings of God. 2 Some alter the 3rd, the 5th, and the 7th names to Bir al-Nabi, a well in the Kuba gardens, Bir al-Ghurbal, and Bir al-Fukayyir, where the Prophet, together with Salman the Persian and others of his companions, planted date trees. The Bir al-Aris has already been described. The Bir al-Ghars, Gharas or Ghurs, so called, it is said, from the place where it was sunk, about half a mile N.E. of the Kuba Mosque, is a large well with an abundance of water. Moham med used to perform ablution on its brink, and directed Ali to wash his corpse with seven skins full of the water. The Bir Rumah is a large well with a spring at the bottom, dug in the Wady al-Akik, to the north of the Mosque Al-Kiblatayn. It is called 11 Kalib Mazni M (the old well of Mazni), in this tradition ; 41 the best of old wells is the old well of Mazni. M And ancient it must be if the legend say true, that when Abu Karb besieged Al-Madinah (a.d. 495), hewas relieved of sickness by drinking its produce. Some assert that it afforded the only sweet water in Al-Madinah when the Prophet arrived there. The town becoming crowded by an influx of visitors, this water was sold by its owner, a man of the Benu Ghaffar tribe, or according to others, by one Mazni, a Jew. Osman at last bought it by paying upwards of 100 camels. The Bir Buza'at, or Biza'at, or Bisa'at, is in the Nakhil or palm plantations, outside the Bab al-Shami or North western gate of Al-Madinah on the right of the road leading to Ohod. Whoever washes in its waters three times shall be healed. The Bir Busat is near the Bakia cemetery, on the left of the road leading to Kuba. The Prophet used to bathe in the water, and he declared it healthy to the skin. The Bir Bayruha, under whose trees the Prophet was fond of sitting, lies outside the Bab Dar al-Ziyafah, leading to Mount Ohod. The Kamus gives the word M Bayruha upon the measure of Fayluha.' Some authorities upon the subject of Ziyarat, write Bayruha, 11 Bir Ha,'—the well of Ha, and variously supposeXIX.—A Ride to th 415 After my sleep, which was allowed to last until a pipe or two of Latakia had gone round the party, we remounted our animals. Returning towards Al-Madinah, my com panions pointed out to me, on the left of the village, a garden called Al-Madshuniyah. It contains a quarry of the yellow loam or bole-earth, called by the Arabs, Tafl, by the Persians, Gil-i-Sarshui, and by the Sindians, Metu. It is used as soap in many parts of the East, and, mixed with oil, it is supposed to cool the body, and to render the skin fresh and supple. It is related that the Prophet cured a Badawi of the Benu Haris tribe, of fever, by wash ing him with a pot of Tafl dissolved in water, and hence the earth of Al-Madinah derived its healing fame.

On the morning of Sunday, the twenty-third Zu 'l Ka'adah (28th August, 1853), arrived from Al-Sham, or Damascus, 1 the great Caravan popularly called Hajj al- Shami, the 'Damascus pilgrimage,' as the Egyptian Cafila is Al-Misri, 2 or the Cairo pilgrimage. It is the main stream which carries off all the small cur rents that, at this season of general movement, flow from Central Asia towards the great centre of the Islamitic world, and in 1853 it amounted to about seven thousand souls. The arrival was anxiously expected by the people for several reasons. In the first place, it brought with it a new curtain for the Prophet's Hujrah, the old one being in a tattered condition; secondly, it had charge of the annual stipends and pensions of the citizens; and thirdly, many families expected members returning under its escort to their homes. The popular anxiety was greatly increased by the disordered state of the country round about; and, moreover, the great caravan had been one day late, generally arriving on the morning of the twenty-second Zu'l Ka'adah. 8 1 This city derives its names, the ' Great Gate of Pilgrimage,' and the ' Key of the Prophet's Tomb ' from its being the gathering- place of this caravan. 2 The Egyptians corruptly pronounce 'Al-Misr,' Cairo, as *• Al-Masr.' 3 Note to Fourth Edition.—I reprint the following from the 11- lustraUd, News in proof that the literati of England have still something During the AO had enten siodenly to the y not a mom feing,embraci ii the morning,: lajlis.

It is composed of two solid wooden cots about four feet in length, slung along the camel's sides and covered over with cloth, in the shape of a tent. They are nearly twice as heavy as the Hijazi litter, and yet a Syrian camel-man would as surely refuse to put one of the latter upon his beast's back, as the Hijazi to carry a Syrian litter. See p. 223, ante. 2 This is the Arabic modern word, synonymous with the Egyptian Hajin, namely, a she-dromedary. The word ' Nakah,' at present popular in Al-Hijaz, means a she-dromedary kept for breeding as well as for riding. - ; :XX.— The Visitation Hamzah's party of fine old Arab Shaykhs of the Hamidah clan, preceded by their varlets, performing the Arzah or war dance,—compared with which the Pyrenean bear's per formance is grace itself,—firing their duck-guns upwards, or blowing the powder into the calves of those before them, brandishing their swords, leaping frantically the while, with their bright coloured rags floating in the wind, tossing their long spears tufted with ostrich feathers high in the air, reckless where they fall; servants seeking their masters, and masters their tents, with vain cries of Ya Mohammed 1 ; grandees riding mules or stalking on foot, preceded by their crowd-beaters, shouting to clear the way ; here the loud shrieks of women and children, whose litters are bumping and rasping against one another , there the low moaning of some poor wretch that is seeking a shady corner to die in : add a thick dust which blurs the outlines like a London fog, with a flaming sun that draws sparkles of fire from the burnished weapons of the crowd, and the brass balls of tent and litter; and—I doubt, gentle reader, that even the length, the jar, and the confusion of this description is adequate to its subject, or that any ' word-painting ' of mine can convey a just idea of the scene. This was the day appointed for our visiting the martyrs of Ohod. After praying the dawn prayers as directed at the Harim, we mounted our donkeys j and, armed with pistols and knives, we set out from the city. Our party was large. Sa'ad the Demon had offered to accompany us, and the bustle around kept him in the best of humours ; Omar Effendi was also there, quiet-looking and humble as usual, leading his ass to avoid the trouble of dismounting every second minute. 3 I had the boy 1 One might as sensibly cry out ' John ' in an English theatre. 2 Respectable men in Al-Hija.z, when they meet friends, 3,0 quaintances, or superiors, consider it only polite to dismount from a donkey.420 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Mohammed and my 'slave,' and Shaykh Hamid was attended by half a dozen relations. To avoid the crush of the Barr al-Manakhah, we made a ^^estwards, over the bridge and down the course of the torrent-bed ' Al-Sayh.' We then passed along the Southern wall of the castle, traversed its Eastern outwork, and issued from the Bab al-Shami. During the greater part of the time we were struggling through a living tide; and among dromedaries and chargers a donkey is by no means a pleasant montuve. With some difficulty, but without any more serious accident than a fall or two, we found our selves in the space beyond and northward of the city. This also was covered with travellers and tents, amongst which on an eminence to the left of the road, rose con spicuous the bright green pavilion of the Emir Al-Hajj, the commandant of the Caravan. 1 Hard by, half its height surrounded by a Kanat or tent wall, stood the Syrian or Sultan's Mahmil (litter), all glittering with green and gilding and gold, and around it were pitched the handsome habitations of the principal officers and grandees of the pilgrimage. On the right hand lay ex tensive palm plantations, and on the left, strewed over the plain, were signs of wells and tanks, built to supply the Hajj with water. We pass two small buildings, one the Kubbat Al-Sabak, or Dome of Precedence, where the Prophet's warrior friends used to display their horseman- i The title of the Pasha who has the privilege of conducting the Caravan. It is a lucrative as well as an honourable employment, for the Emir enjoys the droit d'aubaine, becoming heir to the personal property of all pilgrims who die in the Holy Cities or on the line of march. And no Persian, even of the poorest, would think of under taking a pilgrimage by this line of country, without having at least ^80 in ready money with him. The first person who bore the title of Emir Al-Hajj was Abu Bakr, who, in the ninth year of the Hijrah, led 300 Moslems from Al-Madinah to the Meccah pilgrimage. On this occasion idolaters and infidels were for the first time expelled the Holy City. 1Vmi # Hainid 0 avoid tb cr- '^wWestvait ^ the torreIlt.t|■ 1 Southern ! i and issueiilj, r part of the fc tide; and s by no i hut without aj WO, we foiadiul ward of ind tents, :he road, rosed Hard by, hali nt wall, stood Ij all gli nd it were ncipal officers s ri left, stn ks, built to i| [nallbuili%i cedence. s® ,cl|i arable employ®^* 0 heir to the Cities , wou rithout ion ith year of W 1 the first time if XX-—The Visitation 421 ship; the second the Makan, or burial-place of Sayyidna Zaki al-Din, one of Mohammed's multitudinous descend ants. Then we fall into a plain, resembling that of Kuba, but less fertile. While we are jogging over it, a few words concerning Mount Ohod may not be misplaced. A popular distich says, ' Verily there is healing to the eye that looks Unto Ohod and the two Harrahsi (ridges) near.' And of this holy hill the Apostle declared, ' Ohod is a Mountain which loves Us and which We love: it is upon the Gate of Heaven 2 ;' adding, 1 ' Harrah ' from Harr (heat) is the generic name of lava, porous basalt, scoria, greenstone, schiste, and others supposed to be of igneous origin. It is also used to denote a ridge or hill of such forma tion. One Harrah has already been mentioned in Chapter XV. The second is on the road to Ohod. There is a third Harrah, called Al- Wakin or Al-Zahrah, about one mile Eastward of Al-Madinah. Here the Prophet wept, predicting that the last men of his faith would be foully slain. The prophecy was fulfilled in the days of Yazid, when the people of Al-Madinah filled their assembly with slippers and turbands to show that on account of his abominations they had cast off their allegiance as a garment. The 'Accursed' sent an aged sinner, Muslim bin Akbah al-Marai, who, though a cripple, defeated the Madani in a battle called the ' Affair of the Ridge,' slaying of them 10,000 citizens, 1700 learned and great men, 700 teachers of the Koran, and 97 Karashi nobles. This happened in the month of Zu'l Hijjah, a.h. 63. For three days the city was plundered, the streets ran blood, dogs ate human flesh in the Mosque, and no fewer than 1000 women were insulted. It was long before Al-Madinah recovered from this fatal blow, which old Muslim declared would open to him the gates of Paradise. The occurrence is now forgotten at Al-Madinah, though it will live in history. The people know not the place, and even the books are doubtful whether this Harrah be not upon the spot where the Khandak or moat was. 2 Meaning that on the Day of Resurrection it shall be so treated. Many, however, suppose Ohod to be one of the four hills of Paradise. The other three, according to Al-Tabrani from Amr bin Auf, are Sinai, Lebanon, and Mount Warkan on the Meccan road. Others suppose Ohod to be one of the six mountains which afforded materials for the Kaabah, viz., Abu Kubays, Sinai, Kuds (at Jerusalem), Warkan and422 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah 'And Ayr 1 is a Place which hates Us and which We hate; it is upon the Gate of Hell.' The former sheltered Mohammed in the time of danger; there fore, on Resurrection Day it will be raised to Para dise: whereas Jabal Ayr, its neighbour, having been so ill-judged as to refuse the Prophet water on an occasion while he thirsted, will be cast incontinently into Jahannam. Moslem divines, be it observed, ascribe to Mohammed miraculous authority over animals, vegetables, and minerals, as well as over men, angels, and jinnis. Hence the speaking wolf, the weeping post, the oil-stone, and the love and hate of these two mountains. It is probably one of the many remains of ancient paganism pulled down and afterwards used to build up the edifice of Al-Islam. According to the old Persians, the sphere has an active soul. Some sects of Hindus believe 'mother earth,' upon whose bosom we little parasites crawl, to be a living being. This was a dogma also amongst the ancient Egyptians, who denoted it by a peculiar symbol, —the globe with human legs. Hence the ' Makrokos- mos ' of the plagiaristic Greeks, the animal on a large scale, whose diminutive was the ' Mikrokosmos '—man. Tota natura, repeats Malpighi, Amongst the Romans, Tellus or Terra was a female deity, anthropomorphised according to their syncretic system, which furnished with strange gods their Pantheon, but forgot to append the scroll explaining the inner sense of Radhwah near Yambu'. Also it is said that when the Lord con versed with Moses on Sinai, the mountain burst into six pieces, three of which flew to Al-Madinah, Ohod, Warkan and Radhwah, and three to Meccah, Hira (now popularly called J?tbal Nur), Sabir, (the old name for Jabal Muna), and Saur. i ' Ayr ' means a ' wild ass,' whereas Ohod is derived from Ahad, 'one,'—so called because fated to be the place of victory to those who worship dm God. The very names, say Moslem divines, make it abundantly evident that even as the men of Al-Madinah were of two parties, friendly and hostile to the Prophet, so were these mountains.XX.— The Visitation 423 the symbol. And some modern philosophers, Kepler, Blackmore, and others, have not scrupled to own their belief in a doctrine which as long as ' Life ' is a mere word on man's tongue, can neither be proved nor disproved. The Mohammedans, as usual, exaggerate the dogma,— a Hadis related by Abu Hurayrah casts on the day of judgment the sun and the moon into hell fire. Jabal Ohod owes its present reputation to a cave which sheltered the Apostle when pursued by his enemies 1 ; to certain springs of which he drank, 2 and especially to its being the scene of a battle celebrated in Al-Islam. On Saturday, the nth Shawwal, in the third year of the Hijrah (26th January, a.d. 625), Mohammed with seven hundred men engaged three thousand Infidels under the command of Abu Sufiyan; ran great personal danger, and lost his uncle Hamzah, the 'Lord of Martyrs.' On the topmost pinnacle, also, is the Kubbat Harun, the dome erected over Aaron's remains. It is now, I was told, in a ruinous condition, and is placed upon the 'pin nacle of seven hills 3 ' in a position somewhat like that of certain buildings on St. Angelo in the Bay of Naples. Alluding to the toil of reaching it, the Madani quote a facetious rhyme inscribed upon the wall by one of their number who had wasted his breath:— ' Malun ibn Malun Man tala'a Kubbat Harun ! M Anglice, 'The man must be a ruffian who climbs up to Aaron's dome.' Devout Moslems visit Ohod every Thursday morning after the dawn devotions in the i This Cave is a Place of Visitation, but I did not go there, as it is on the Northern flank of the hill, and all assured me that it con tained nothing worth seeing. Many ignore it altogether. 2 Ohod, it is said, sent forth in the Prophet's day 360 springs, of which ten or twelve now remain. 3 Meaning that the visitor must ascend several smaller eminences. The time occupied is from eight to nine hours, but I should not advise my successor to attempt it in the hot weather.424 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Harim; pray for the Martyrs; and, after going through the ceremonies, return to the Harim in time for mid-day worship. On the 12th of Rajab, Zairs come out in large bodies from the city, encamp on the plain for three or four days, and pass the time in feasting, jollity, and de votion, as is usual at pilgrimages and at saints' festivals in general. After half an hour's ride we came to the Mustarah or resting-place, so called because the Prophet sat here for a few minutes on his way to the battle of Ohod. It is a newly-built square enclosure of dwarf whitewashed walls, within which devotees pray. On the outside front ing Al-Madinah is a seat like a chair of rough stones. Here I was placed by my Muzawwir, who recited an insignificant supplication to be repeated after him. At its end with the Fatihah and accompaniments, we re mounted our asses and resumed our way. Travelling onwards, we came in sight of the second Harrah or ridge. It lies to the right and left of the road, and resembles lines of lava, but I had not an opportunity to examine it narrowly. 1 Then we reached the gardens of Ohod, which reflect in miniature those of Kuba; and presently we arrived at what explained the presence of verdure and vegetable life,—a deep Fiumara full of loose sand and large stones denoting an impetuous stream. It flows along the Southern base of Ohod, said to be part of the plain of Al-Madinah, and it collects the drainage of the high lands lying to the South and South-east. The bed becomes impassable after rain, and sometimes the torrents over flow the neighbouring gardens. By the direction of this Fiumara I judged that it must supply the Ghabbah or 'basin' in the hills north of the plain.

The Visitation 425 ties, however, informed me that a large volume of water will not stand there, but flows down the beds that wind through the Ghats westward of Al-Madinah, and falls into the sea near the harbour of Wijh. To the south of the Fiumara is a village on an eminence, containing some large brick houses now in a ruinous state; these are the villas of opulent and religious citizens who visited the place for change of air, recreation, and worship at Ham- zah's tomb. Our donkeys presently sank fetlock-deep in the loose sand of the torrent-bed. Then reaching the Northern side, and ascending a gentle slope, we found ourselves upon the battle-field. This spot, so celebrated in the annals of Al-Islam, is a shelving strip of land, close to the Southern base of Mount Ohod. The army of the Infidels advanced from the Fiumara in crescent shape, with Abu Sufiyan, the general, and his idols in the centre. It is distant about three miles from Al-Madinah, in a Northerly direction. 1 All the visitor sees is hard gravelly ground, covered with little heaps of various coloured granite, red sand stone, and bits of porphyry, to denote the different places where the martyrs fell, and were buried. 2 Seen from this point, there is something appalling in the look of the Holy Mountain. Its seared and jagged flanks rise like masses of iron from the plain, and the crevice into which the Moslem host retired, when the disobedience of the archers in hastening to plunder enabled Khalid bin Walid to fall upon Mohammed's rear, is the only break in the grim wall. Reeking with heat, its surface pro- 1 Most Arab authors place Ohod about two miles N. of Ai- Madinah. Al-Idrisi calls it the nearest hill, and calculates the distance at 6000 paces.

I was glad to turn away my eyes from it. To the left of the road North of the Fiumara, and lead ing to the mountains, stands Hamzah's Mosque, which, like the Harim of Al-Madinah, is a Mausoleum as well as a fane. It is a small strongly built square of hewn stone, with a dome covering the solitary hypostyle to the South, and the usual minaret. The Westward wing is a Zawiyah or oratory, 1 frequented by the celebrated Sufi and Saint, Mohammed al-Samman, the 'Clarified Butter-Seller,' one of whose a!

On the right of the road opposite Hamzah's Mosque, is a large erection, now in ruins, containing a deep hole leading to a well, with huge platforms for the accommodation of travellers. Beyond, towards the moun tains, are the small edifices presently to be described. Some Turkish women were sitting veiled upon the shady platform opposite the Martyrs' Mosque. At a little distance their husbands, and the servants holding horses and asses, lay upon the ground, and a large crowd of Badawin, boys, girls, and old women, had gathered around to beg, draw water, and sell dry dates. They i A Zawiyah in Northern Africa resembles the Takiyah of India, Persia, and Egypt, being a monastery for Darwayshes who reside there singly or in numbers. A Mosque, and sometimes, according to the excellent practice of Al-Islam, a school, are attached to it.XX.— The Visitation 427 were awaiting the guardian, who had not yet acknow ledged the summons. After half an hour's vain patience, we determined to proceed with the ceremonies. Ascending by its steps the Mastabah subtending half the Eastern wall, Shaykh Hamid placed me so as to front the tomb. There standing in the burning sun, we repeated the following prayer: 'Peace be upon Thee, O our Lord Hamzah! O Paternal Uncle of Allah's Apostle! O Paternal Uncle of Allah's Prophet! Peace be upon Thee, O Paternal Uncle of Mustafa! Peace be upon Thee, O Prince of the Martyrs! O Prince of the Happy! Peace be upon Thee, O Lion of Allah! O Lion of His Prophet!' After which, we asked Hamzah and his companions to lend us their aid in obtaining for us and ours pardon, worldly prosperity and future happiness. Scarcely had we finished, when, mounted on a high-trotting dromedary, appeared the emissary of Mohammed Kalifah, descend ant of Al-Abbas, who keeps the key of the Mosque, and who receives the fees and donations of the devout. It was to be opened for the Turkish pilgrims. I waited to see the interior. The Arab drew forth from his pouch, with abundant solemnity, a bunch of curiously made keys, and sharply directed me to stand away from and out of sight of the door. When I obeyed, grumblingly, he began to rattle the locks, and to snap the padlocks, opening them slowly, shaking them, and making as much noise as possible. The reason of the precaution—it sounded like poetry if not sense—is this. It is believed that the souls of martyrs, leaving the habitations of their senseless clay, 1 are fond of sitting together in spiritual i Some historians relate that forty-six years after the battle of Ohod, the tombs were laid bare by a torrent, when the corpses ap peared in their winding-sheets as if buried the day before. Some had their hands upon their death wounds, from which fresh blood trickled when the pressure was forcibly removed. In opposition to this Moslem theory, we have that of the modern Greeks, namely,428 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah Mcccah. converse, and profane eye must not fall upon the scene, What grand pictures these imaginative Arabs see!

On the walls are a few modern inscriptions and framed poetry, written in a calligraphic hand. Beneath the Riwak lies Hamzah, under a mass of black basaltic stone, 1 resembling that of Aden, only more porous and scoriaceous, convex at the top, like a heap of earth, without the Kiswah, 2 or cover of a saint's tomb, and railed round with wooden bars. At his head, or westward, lies Abdullah bin Jaysh, a name little known to fame, under a plain whitewashed tomb, also convex ; and in the courtyard is a similar pile, erected over the remains of Shammas bin Osman, another obscure Companion. 8 We then passed through a door in the Northern part of the Western wall, and saw a diminutive palm plantation and a well. After which we left the Mosque, and I was under the ' fatal necessity ' of paying a dollar for the honour of entering it. But the guardian promised that the chapters Y. S. and Al-Ikhlas should be recited for my benefit, the latter forty times ; and if their efficacy be one-twentieth part of what men say it is, the reader can not quote against me a certain popular proverb concern ing an order of men easily parted from their money. Issuing from the Mosque, we advanced a few paces towards the mountain. On our left we passed by—at a respectful distance, for the Turkish Hajis cried out that their women were engaged in ablution—a large Sahrij or tank, built of cut stone with steps, and intended to detain 1 In Ibn Jubayr's time the tomb was red, 2 In the common tombs of martyrs, saints, and holy men, this covering is usually of green cloth, with long white letters sewn upon it.

I do not know what has become of the third martyr, said to have been interred near Hamzah. Possibly some day he may reappear: mean while the people of Al-Madinah are so wealthy in saints, that they can well afford to lose sight of one.430 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah Meccah. r the overflowing waters of the torrent. The next place we prayed at was a small square, enclosed with dwarf whitewashed walls, containing a few graves denoted by ovals of loose stones thinly spread upon the ground. This is primitive Arab simplicity. The Badawin still mark the places of their dead with four stones planted at the head, the feet, and the sides; in the centre the earth is either heaped up Musannam like the hump of a camel), or more generally left Musattah (level). I there fore suppose that the latter was the original shape of the Prophet's tomb. Within the enclosure certain martyrs of the holy army were buried. After praying there, we repaired to a small building still nearer to the foot of the mountain. It is the usual cupola springing from four square walls, not in the best preservation. Here the Prophet prayed, and it is called the Kubbat al-Sanaya, ' Dome of the Front Teeth,' from the following circum stance. Five Infidels were bound by oath to slay Mo hammed at the battle of Ohod: one of these, Ibn Kumayyah, threw so many stones, and with such good will, that two rings of the Prophet's helmet were driven into his cheek, and blood poured from his brow down his mustachios, which he wiped with a cloak to prevent the drops falling to the ground. Then Utbah bin Abi Wakkas hurled a stone at him, which, splitting his lower lip, knocked out one of his front teeth. 1 On the left of the Mihrab, inserted low down in the wall, is a square stone, upon which Shaykh Hamid showed me the impression of a tooth 2 : he kissed it with peculiar reverence, and so did I. But the boy Mohammed being by me objurgated—for I 1 Formerly in this place was shown a slab with the mark of a man's head—like St. Peter's at Rome—where the Prophet had rested. Now it seems to have disappeared, and the tooth has suc ceeded to its honours. 2 Some historians say that four teeth were knocked out by this stone.

Already he had appeared at the Harim without his Jubbah, and with ungirt loins—in waistcoat and shirt-sleeves. More over, he had conducted himself indecorously by nudging Shaykh Hamid's sides during divine service. Feeling that the youth's 'moral man' was, like his physical, under my charge, and determined to arrest a course of conduct which must have ended in obtaining for me, the master, the reputation of a 'son of Belial,' I in sisted upon his joining us in the customary two- bow prayers. And Sa'ad the Demon, taking my side of the question with his usual alacrity when a disturbance was in prospect, the youth found it necessary to yield. After this little scene, Shaykh Hamid pointed out a sprawling inscription blessing the Companions of the Prophet. The unhappy Abu Bakr's name had been half effaced by some fanatic Shi'ah, a circumstance which seemed to arouse all the evil in my companion's nature; and, looking close at the wall I found a line of Persian verse to this effect: ' I am weary of my life (Umr), because it bears the name of Umar.'i We English wanderers are beginning to be shamed out of our 'vulgar' habit of scribbling names and nonsense in noted spots. Yet the practice is both classical and oriental. The Greeks and Persians left their marks everywhere, as Egypt shows; and the paws of the Sphinx bear scratches which, being interpreted, are found to be the same manner of trash as that written upon the remains of Thebes in a.d. 1879. And Easterns appear never to 1 In Persian characters the word Umr, life, and Umar, the name of the hated caliph, are written in the same way; which explains the pun.432 Pilgrimage to A l-Madinah Meccah. enter a building with a white wall without inditing upon it platitudes in verse and prose. Influenced by these con siderations, I drew forth a pencil and inscribed in the Kubbat al-Sanaya, jcJJI i n ^ ' Abdullah, the servant of Allah.' (a.h.) 1269. Issuing from the dome, we turned a few paces to the left, passed northwards, and thus blessed the Martyrs of Ohod : 44 Peace be upon Ye, O Martyrs ! Peace be upon Ye, O Blessed ! ye Pious ! ye Pure ! who fought upon Allah's Path the good Fight, who worshipped your Lord until He brought you to Certainty. 1 Peace be upon You of whom Allah said (viz., in the Koran), Verily repute not them slain on God's Path (?.^., warring with Infidels); nay, rather they are alive, and there is no Fear upon them, nor are they sorrowful !' Peace be upon Ye, O Martyrs of Ohod ! One and All, and the Mercy of Allah and His Blessings.' Then again we moved a few paces forward and went through a similar ceremony, supposing ourselves to be in the cave that sheltered the Apostle. After which, return ing towards the torrent-bed by the way we came, we stood a small distance from a cupola called Kubbat al- Masra. It resembles that of the ' Front-teeth,' and notes, as its name proves, the place where the gallant 1 That is to say, ' to the hour of death.'inditing ■nscribed iir| a few paces til sedtheMartjiiil who fougltf .hipped you U 'eace m),' Verily rii ing with Inii' i is no Fearf :e be upoa le ; forward aaJE ifter way we ca»l , called K# Frontrf 3 where r deatb. 1 XX.— The Visitation 433 Hamzah fell by the spear of Wahshi the slave. 1 We faced towards it and finished the ceremonies of this Ziyarat by a Supplication, the Testification, and the Fatihah. In the evening I went with my friends to the Harim. The minaret galleries were hung with lamps, and the inside of the temple was illuminated. It was 1 When Jubayr bin Mutim was marching to Ohod, according to the Rauzat al-Safa, in revenge for the death of his uncle Taymah, he offered manumission to his slave Wahshi, who was noted for the use of the Abyssinian spear, if he slew Hamzah. The slave sat in ambush behind a rock, and when the hero had despatched one Siba'a bin Abd al- Ayiz, of Meccah, he threw a javelin which pierced his navel and came out of his back. The wounded man advanced towards his assassin, who escaped. Hamzah then fell, and his friends coming up, found him dead. Wahshi waited till he saw an opportunity, drew the javelin from the body, and mutilated it, in order to present trophies to the ferocious Hinda (mother of Mu'awiyah), whose father Utbah had been slain by Hamzah. The amazon insisted upon seeing the corpse : having presented her necklace and bracelets to Wahshi, she supplied their place with the nose, the ears, and other parts of the dead hero. After mangling the body in a disgusting manner, she ended by tearing open the stomach and biting the liver, whence she was called ' Akkalat al-Akbad.' When Mohammed saw the state of his father's brother, he was sadly moved. Presently comforted by the inspirations brought by Gabriel, he cried, ' It is written among the people of the seven Heavens, Hamzah, son of Muttalib, is the Lion of Allah, and the Lion of his Prophet,' and ordered him to be shrouded and prayed over him, beginning, says the Jazb al-Kulub, with seventy repetitions of ' Allah Akbar.' Ali had brought in his shield some water for Mohammed, from a Mahras or stone trough, which stood near the scene of action (M. C. de Perceval translates it ' un creux de rocher formant un bassin naturel'). But the Prophet refused to drink it, and washed with it the blood from the face of him *' martyred by the side of the Mahras.' It was of the Moslems slain at Ohod, according to Abu Da'ud, that the Prophet declared that their souls should be carried in the crops of green birds, that they might drink of the waters and taste the fruits of Paradise, and nestle beneath the golden lamps that hang from the celestial ceiling. He also for bade, on this occasion, the still popular practice of mutilating an enemy's corpse. VOL I. 28434 Pilgrimage to Al-Madina Meccah. crowded with Hajis, amongst whom were many women, a circumstance which struck me from its being unusual. 1 Some pious pilgrims, who had duly paid for the privilege, were perched upon ladders trimming wax candles of vast dimensions, others were laying up for themselves rewards in Paradise, by performing the same office to the lamps; many were going through the ceremonies of Ziyarat, and not a few were sitting in different parts of the Mosque apparently overwhelmed with emotion. The boys and the beggars were inspired with fresh energy, the Aghawat were gruffer and surlier than I had ever seen them, and the young men about town walked and talked with a freer and an easier demeanour than usual. My old friends the Persians—there were about 1200 of them in the Hajj Caravan—attracted my attention. The door keepers stopped them with curses as they were about to enter, and all claimed from each the sum of five piastres, whilst other Moslems were allowed to enter the Mosque free. Unhappy men ! they had lost all the Shiraz swagger, their mustachios dropped pitiably, their eyes would not look any one in the face, and not a head bore a cap stuck upon it crookedly. When ever an ''Ajami,' whatever might be his rank, stood in the way of an Arab or a Turk, he was rudely thrust aside, with abuse muttered loud enough to be heard by all around. All eyes followed them as they went through the ceremonies of Ziyarat, especially as they approached the tombs of Abu Bakr and Omar,—which every man is bound to defile if he can,—and the supposed place of Fatimah's burial. Here they stood in parties, after praying before the Prophet's window : one read from a book the pathetic tale of the Lady's life, sorrows, and i The Prophet preferred women and young boys to pray privately, and in some parts of Al-Islam they are not allowed to join a congre gation. At Al-Madinah, however, it is no longer, as in Burckhardt's time, 41 thought very indecorous in women to enter the Mosque.'ccah, musiial, 1 &gt; r the privilege selves rewarls ofZiyarat,^ of the The gy. seen them, ai d usual.

Sometimes their emotion was too strong to be repressed. ' Ay Fatimah! Ay Muzlumah! Way ! way !—O Fatimah ! O thou injured one ! Alas ! alas !' burst involuntarily from their lips, despite the danger of such exclamations ; tears trickled down their hairy cheeks, and their brawny bosoms heaved with sobs. A strange sight it was to see rugged fellows, mountaineers perhaps, or the fierce Iliyat of the plains, sometimes weep ing silently like children, sometimes shrieking like hysteric girls, and utterly careless to conceal a grief so coarse and grisly, at the same time so true and real, that I knew not how to behold it. Then the Satanic scowls with which they passed by, or pretended to pray at, the hated Omar's tomb ! With what curses their hearts are belying those mouths full of blessings ! How they are internally canonising Fayruz—the Persian slave who stabbed Omar in the Mosque—and praying for his eternal happiness in the presence of the murdered man ! Sticks and stones, how ever, and not unfrequently the knife and the sabre, have taught them the hard lesson of disciplining their feelings ; and nothing but a furious contraction of the brow, a roll of the eye, intensely vicious, and a twitching of the muscles about the region of the mouth, denote the wild storm of wrath within. They generally, too, manage to discharge some part of their passion in words. ' Hail Omar, thou hog !' exclaims some fanatic Madani as he passes by the heretic—a demand more outraging than requiring a red- hot, black-north Protestant to bless the Pope. ' O Allah! hell him !' meekly responds the Persian, changing the benediction to a curse most intelligible to, and most delicious in, his fellows' ears. 1 i I have heard of a Persian being beaten to death, because in stead of saying 'Peace be with thee, Ya Omar,' he insisted upon saying 'Peace be with thee, Ya Humar (O ass!)' A favourite trick is to change ' Razi Allahu anhu—may Allah be satisfied with him!'—V 436 Pilgrimage toAl-Madinah An evening hour in the steamy heat of the Harim was equal to half a dozen afternoons; and I left it resolved never to revisit it till the Hajj departed from Al-Madinah. It was only prudent not to see much of the 'Ajamis; and as I did so somewhat ostentatiously, my companions discovered that the Shaykh Abdullah, having slain many of those heretics in some war or other, was avoiding them to escape retaliation. In proof of my generalistic quali ties, the rolling down of the water jar upon the heads of the Maghribi Pilgrims in the ' Golden Thread ' was quoted, and all offered to fight for me I took care not to contradict the report. to ' Razi Allahu Aan.' This last word is not to be found in Richard son, but any 'Luti' from Shiraz or Isfahan can make it intelligible to the curious linguist.

'Commander Robinson, whose able work, 'The British Fleet,' was reviewed in these columns in November, 1894, has now undertaken the editing of a series of handbooks, each of which will deal with one particular subject connected with that great creation, the Royal Navy. Our national literature has certainly lacked much in this respect. Such bpoks as have heretofore been produced have almost invariably been of a character too scientific and technical to be of much use to the general public. The series now being issued is intended to obviate this defect, and when completed will form a description, both historical and actual, of the Royal Navy, which will not only be of use to the professional student, but also be of interest to all who are concerned in the maintenance and efficiency of the Navy.'— Broad Arrow. ^he series of naval handbooks edited by Commander ^ Robinson has made a most hopeful beginning, and may be counted upon to^ supply the growing popular demand for information in regard to the Navy, on which the national existence depends.'— Times* 'Messrs. Bell's series of 'Royal Navy Handbooks' promises to be a very successful enterprise.

'T'HE inauguration of this series of copyright works was the first attempt on the part of English publishers to provide good literature at a low price. It was commenced in 1847 by Mr, H, G. Bobn with the issue of his Standard Library, which consisted of reprints and translations of the classical literature of England, Germany, France, and Italy. The success which attended this was so great that Mr. Bohn was encouraged to extend the field, and he started the various ' Libraries' known as The Scientific, The Illustrated, The Classical, The Antiquarian, &amp;c. In every case the works were admirably printed on good paper, and furnished with illustrations, portraits, and maps of the highest quality. So important an influence has this series obtained in the advancement of English education, that there is hardly a library, public or private, the nucleus of which is not founded in ' Bohn.' THOMAS CARLYLE said of it: '/ may manner of books, Bohn's Publication Series is the usefullest thing I knowj' and his friend EMERSON recognised its admirable purpose when he said: 4 The translation Bohn's Library done for literature what railroads hav In 1864 Messrs. Bell &amp; Sons acquired the series, and from time to time added new works, until to-day it includes over 770 volumes in all departments of literature, art, and science. With the progress of scholarship and research, Messrs. Bell &amp; Sons have found that new editions and new translations were necessary, and these they have initiated, with the result that Bohn's Libraries are unrivalled for accuracy of text. As for the editorial work, the chief literary organ of America—the New York CRITIC—considers ' the Bohn's Standard Library is a guara Within late years the publishers have so far improved the paper, printing, and binding, that the volumes form handsome as well as essential additions to every library.1 An important body of cheap literature, for which every living worker in this country who draws strength from the past has reason to be grateful.' Professor Henry Morley. * Messrs. Bell 8c Sons are still energetically pursuing their task of adding to and improving the famous series of Bohn's Libraries, which Thomas Carlyle pro nounced to be ''the usefullest thing I know,' and are . . . constantly adding to the Libraries, in the new and certainly pleasanter form, reprints of Standard Works which no gentleman's library should be without.*—Mr. Frederic Harrison in the Daily Chronicle.

(N.Y.) ' This new and attractive form in which the volumes of Bohn's Standard Library are being issued is not meant to hide either indifference in the selection of books included in this well-known series, or carelessness in the editing.' St. 'Messrs.
