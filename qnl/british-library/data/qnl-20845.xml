His Highness Shaikh Hamad died on 20th February at Rumaitha where he was staving in one of his hunting lodges. He made his last public appearance four days Lore his death at a ceremonial parade of the State Forces wh.ch was held at the Manamah Palace to celebrate the tenth anniversary of h.s accessmn. His health had given cause for anxiety for some time, for many &gt; ears 1 suffering from diabetes. He was buried in the cemetery on the plam below Rafaa. Shaikh Hamad was the second son of the late Ruler Shaikh Isa bin Ah, who • pfl for about sixty years. His elder brother, Shaikh Salman, died when e xvnfcomparatively young. Shaikh Hamad was appointed Heir Apparent by his father ^n i896. When Shaikh Isa retired from active part.c.paUou .n puW.c affairs Shaikh Hamad became Deputy Ruler and he succeede to t ic ai on his father's death in 1932. In 1921 Shaikh Hamad received the C.S.I, and m 1935 he was crea ^ K.C.I.E He was made a Knight of the Grand Cross of the Sacred Order of the Pope Saint Silvester by His Holiness the Pope. He went to England twice, in 1925 and 1936, on the second occasion he was the guest of the British Government. He frequently vis.ted India and in 1937 did the pilgrimage to Mecca. When Shaikh Hamad became Deputy Ruler conditions in Bahrain were erv different to what they are now, there was a lack of law and order and fre- tlv Shaikh Hamad was confronted with disturbances and disorders. Once r Sr ~ assination. During his rule he successfully introduce Lnv wise reforms and instituted a stable and lasting administration. He devoted a great part of the revenue towards improving the lot of Ins people by provi ing social services and establishing public security. He set up ^nicipaht.es, courts and public departments and he built schools, hospitals, roads and bridges he lived 'ihtcXI—.p-p.™-dfro'*— remembered in Bahrain and in the other States around the Gulf as a just and tolerant ruler.

The year 1361 brought a closer realisation of the war to the people of Bahrain owing to various rules and restrictions which directly affected their lives. During the first half of the year the black-out was intensified, A.R.P. measures were undertaken and rationing was introduced. The efforts and propaganda of an active A.R.P. committee produced little co-operation from the public, the only noticeable result being that many of the wealthy townsfolk who might have set an example spent the summer months in barasti camps along the coasts. Towards the end of the year the black-out and A.R.P. measures were relaxed. Rationing was accepted without any demur and was welcomed by the poorer people who having no hoarded supplies had been the first to suffer. When rationing began they found themselves enjoying equal rights to the upper and wealthier classes. The introduction of rationing among the illiterate inhabitants of the country was simplified by a census having been taken for the first time in 1941. The sale of rationed foods at controlled prices in Government shops in towns and villages struck a blow at the credit system. Formerly most people were in debt to their local shopkeeper but with rationing in force debts were no longer possible. The presence of British and Indian troops in Bahrain for the first time in history was accepted with complete equanimity by the Arab population and owing to the admirable behaviour of the troops no undesirable incidents of any kind occurred during the year. The provision of fresh supplies for the troops put an additional tax on the markets but this was partly compensated for by the money which the troops spent in the country on labour and purchases. His Highness's Government gave all possible assistance and co-operated fully in all things connected with the furtherance of the war. The Government enlisted for the Royal Air Force two companies of Levies which were recruited in a very short time, twice this number could have been obtained had they been required. Land for camps and aerodromes and other military purposes was provided freely by the Government in various parts of Bahrain. Two large wards on the first floor of the State Hospital with ancillary services were provided for services patients and the hospital was used during the year by officers and other ranks of the Navy, Army and Air Force. The State Public Works Department, never very heavily staffed, was employed throughout the year almost entirely upon military works such as camps and temporary and permanent military buildings and aerodromes. Military work was also done by the Electric Department and the Government Garage. The most urgent problem which faced the Government throughout the year was to ensure a steady flow of essential foodstuffs into Bahrain from outside. Apart from fish and a small proportion of the dates locally consumed all supplies were imported from abroad. One of the first acts of His Highness Shaikh Salman when he succeeded was an attempt to purchase from India a large stock of rice but unfortunately he was too late as owing to restrictions on the export of rice it was unobtainable. In the beginning the Bahrain Government relied upon local mer chants to import foodstuffs from India but owing to the controlled prices in Bahrain and the limited, though not ungenerous, amount of profit allowed to importers the244 merchants were more interested in importing goods from where no control existed and profiteering was not restricted. I he local mer cha ^, most of them foreigners or of foreign origin, with one or two exceptions faded com- nletelv in this emergency and made no attempt to co-operate with the Gov ernm o he coun' wluch most of them had made their fortunes. My. m the invests of the public, not with any wish to compete with the mercantile commu- nitv the Bahrain Government was compelled to become the purchaser, the - d the S eller of most of the essential foodstuffs, such as wheat, sugar d It ™ t— '... by th«. mean, suppl.e. wo,, ob^n.d and could be sold to the public at reasonable cost. For this reason the surplus rev enue L' year which would normally have been added to the Reserve Fund was kept available for purchasing food for the country. There was no time during the yca Xn eienlial food was not available, though sometimes one commodity was unobtainable, but in spite of controlled prices the cost of llv »g most cases the incomes of the purchasers remained statio ^ obv iously of the vear the condition of the poor, especially in some of the v dlag- deteriorated and cases were reported in which people were said to ^ 0 * starvation The food position in the villages would not have been so bad if Ba landowners had not deliberately hoarded most of the date crop in the hopes making great profits at the end of the season. Lack of employment and difficult conditions among the people was respon sible for an increase of crime but not of a serious type. Most of the eases which were dealt with were thieving and pilfering. Frequently people on trial in com asked to be sent to jail because they were unable to feed themselves. The cheap ness of food in Bahrain, especially sugar, in comparison to prices in neighbouring States was a powerful incentive to smuggling. The Police were responsible for detecting tnany cases of smuggling food out of Bahrain which were severely punished by the Bahrain courts. Smuggling into Bahrain ecame a mg ( JTS JLwto. concentrated tl.oie skill and Ing.nni.y on eo.nocng ***. from Bahrain to Kuwait or Iraq. There were no important changes in local administration d-ng ^ yea. Medical work and anti -malaria measures continued to develop. The last of the State Hospital was completed and a new Lady Doctor was appointed to Women s Hospital. The schools had a successful year and was transferred to new quarters. The Municipalities co-operated actively wit Government in rationing and food control. There was a decrease in revenue during the year and an increase in t e cos of administration owing mainly to the general lisc in pi ice The Budget for 1362 contains no abnormal items ; the revenue, especially from customs sources, has been estimated on a very conserva^^ the uncertainty of imports. Expenditure consists almost recurrent items and no public works of any magnitude have been contemplate . C. DALRYMPLE BELGRAVE, C.B.E., v Adviser to the Government of Bahrain. Bahrain, ) Dated, 19^ May 1943 •)11 REVENUE 1361. The anticipated revenue for 1361 was Rs. 37,00,000. The actual revenue was Rs. 39,81,000. The difference was mainly customs revenue which I estimated at Rs. 7,00,000 but which produced Rs. 8,77,000 ; most of the other sources of revenue produced slightly more than was expected. Last year's total revenue was Rs. 44.^,500. Comparing the revenue of 1361 with that of 1360 it would appear that there was a falling off in revenue of about 4^ lakhs. In 1360 however there were two abnormal receipts, profit on transfer of the Reserve Fund from England to India (Rs. 1 ,76,000) and Depreciation Reserve on deposit with the Government, which was shown as a receipt (Rs. 1 ,00,000) therefore the decrease in normal revenue was approximately Rs. 1 ,75,000. The increase of approximately one lakh in customs receipts in 1361 was due not to a larger volume of imports but to the greatly increased prices of imports. The oil royalty in 1361 was almost 3J lakhs lower than in 1360. Judicial receipts were three times the amount which was budgetted owing to heavy fines imposed by the Court on food hoarders and in smuggling cases. Bridge tolls amounted to Rs. 37,600 which was Rs. 7,000 more than was estimated. This revenue would have been greater if the difficulty in obtaining tyres and spare parts had not reduced the number of public vehicles plying between Manamah and Muharraq and elsewhere. Education receipts were Rs. 10,000 as against Rs. 15,000 last year as fees due for foreign students were not received before the end of the year. Medical receipts included payments on account of members of the British Forces treated in the Government hospital. The sum of Rs. 57,649 was realised by the sale of £$0,000. 3h 0 /o India War Loan, held in the Eastern Bank, Limited, London, which was sold out and the proceeds re-invested in 3% Savings Bonds. EXPENDITURE 1361. In the Budget for 1361 the estimated recurrent expenditure was Rs. 27,20,000, excluding the amount which it was hoped would be added to the Reserve Fund. The actual expenditure during the year was Rs. 30,17,800 of which about 50,000 was recoverable from the Royal Air lorce being expenditure by the Public Works Department on building works undertaken on behalf of the Royal Air Force. The actual expenditure in the previous year was Rs. 31, 53. 000 - The payment to the Ruling Family from oil revenue was governed by the royalty received, the Civil List was Rs. 6,000 less than in the previous year. Expenditure under most headings was higher than in 1360 and in some cases. Public Health, Public Protection and Public Works, expenditure exceeded the budgetted amounts. In general the reasons for this were the increased cost of all commodities, the special war allowance which was drawn for 7 months of the year by all employees earning less than Rs. 150 per month and the expansion of medical services and education. Public Health budget was overspent by approximately Rs. 60,000. This expenditure included (about Rs. 28,000) purchase of extra drugs and surgical sundries, ordered in 1360, which were bought as a precautionary measure. In many cases they are now unobtainable. Part of the expenses were incurred in order to make the hospital suitable for European patients. Owing to the rise m food prices the cost of diets increased considerably and no provision was made for feeding a large number of persons for many months in the Quarantine Station throughout the small-pox epidemic. As they could not supply food they had to be fed at Government expense. Public Protection exceeded its budget by approximately Rs. 32,000. Most of the difference was due to the greatly increased cost of rations of men and animals, the war allowance paid to the natur force, cost of clothing and the expense of the British personnel from the Indian 1 olice which exceeded the amount which was refunded to the state by the Bahrain I etroleum Company. The works done by the Public Works Department included a number of items which were not included in the 1361 budget.12 Relief measures included Rs. 20,500 contributed by the Government to the two Poor Relief Committees. In 1360 a sum of one lakh of rupees was transferred from the Electrical Department account to the Consolidated Fund account. This represented the ' Depreciation Reserve ' shown in the Electrical Accounts for the year 1360, and this amount was placed on deposit with the Government. In 1361 this lakh of rupees was repaid into the Electrical account with the intention that this department should invest it in Government of India securities. Owing to the fact that the Government was in need of all available funds for purchasing food supplies, this investment has been postponed until 1362. The Government took over the interests which the Manamah and Muharraq municipalities had in the Electrical Scheme and repaid them the amount of capital which they had originally subscribed. By the end of the year the Government had spent Rs. 7,73,000 on food supplies which were held by the Government. These supplies will be sold during 1362 and have been shown on the revenue side of the 1362 budget. This sum is part of the amount which normally have been added to the Reserve Fund during the year. PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT. Throughout the year 1361 this department has been mainly occupied in carrying out a big programme of building work for the Royal Air Force. With no addition to the small normal staff, construction of camps, buildings, aerodrome works, etc., etc., amounting to about 2^ lakhs of rupees have been completed. The possibility of the Bahrain Government being asked to undertake work for the military authorities was considered when the budget for 1361 was made and this was one of the reasons why no important new projects were contemplated in the budget. At the end of 1361 more R.A.F. work is under consideration and the Public Works Department will probably be occupied with this during the first half of the year 1362. Almost all the expenditure on R.A.F. works consisted of payments for labour and for local purchases which provided useful employment for Bahrain workmen. It became necessary during the year for the Government to make a small increase in rates of wages and the cost of local building materials, stone, wood, lime, etc., was also raised. Apart from special work for the R.A.F. the following Government works were completed or commenced :— Government Hospital.— Completion of Surgery Block, Staff Sisters' quarters, new European Ward with kitchens, bath-rooms, etc., etc. Manama Sea Road.— Beginning of extension of the road past the Government Hospital. This work is being done on behalf of the Government by the Manama Municipality. Manama-Muharraq Road.— Completion of surfacing the road, alterations to Muharraq Naturs Station, construction of a roundabout and removal of Muharraq flag pole to another site. Manama Palace.— Conversion of two rooms into one to be used as a dining-room. New tank in the Palace garden with drainage to cultivated ground on the west of the garden. Fire Engine Station near the Adviserate. Camp for Special Police. Reclaiming swamp at Budeya. In addition to the usual upkeep of roads and buildings the department made furniture for schools and carried out a number of minor works.(z4r 13 The P.W.D. budget for 1362 provides for the completion of the Sea Road Extension, a wall surrounding the Government Hospital with gates, some improvements to the Fort including a new Clothing Store and magazine, enlargements to the jail at Jida, a dhobi ghat near the Palace Garden, further alterations to the Manama Palace, a guard room at the Adviserate, rebuilding the Fort stables, additions and alterations to Government Hospital Dispensary and a Mortuary. The total amount allocated for new works is Rs. 50,000. Upkeep of roads and bridges is estimated at Rs. 15,000 and annual repairs to Government buildings at Rs. 15,000. THE DIVING INDUSTRY. Although the price of pearls was higher than last year, especially at the end of the season, yet the season as a whole was a bad one. Divers, Nakhudas and the shore merchants who financed the boats in most cases made no profits. Out of 188 boats whose accounts were dealt with by the Government clerks only 45 boats made a profit. One important pearl was found which was sold for Rs. 6,000 and in this boat divers received Rs. 282 and pullers Rs. 188. At one time prices in the pearl market dropped suddenly by 25% but recovered after some weeks and then rose at the end of the season. This fluctuation was due to the disturbances in India which caused the Bombay market to close down for some time. The reason for the unsuccessful season was the great increase in the price of foodstuffs and the increase in the amounts of the diving advances which were decided upon at the usual meeting of diving Nakhudas and merchants soon after the previous season. The 1360 season was good and the merchants and Nakhudas optimistically assumed that the 1361 season would be still better. There was an increase in the number of diving boats, in 1360 the number of licensed diving boats was 222, in the year under review 298 boats went to the banks. I estimate that the value of the catch in 1361 was Rs. 10,35,000, about 28% more than in 1360. This represents the amount received by divers and Nakhudas and is considerably less than the final value of the pearls when they leave Bahrain after changing hands. The biggest buyers in 1361 were Seth Kishni and Seth Gendmal, Hindu merchants of Bombay, Messrs. Dhamanmal Isardas, Shaikh Mustafa bin Abdul Latif, Shaikh Mohamed Ah Zarnal and Haj Abdul Rehman Mohamed Taher Khunji. A new and useful market, though not at present very important, for medium and low grade pearls developed in Iraq where Jewish merchants have begun to interest themselves in pearls. The following table shows the fluctuations in prices in Bahrain during the season 1360 per chow Rs. Rs. 70 to 15 to ! 25 to 5 to 1361 per chow Sherin Golwa Na'am Badla 90 20 30 7 Rs. 120 30 40 to to to to Rs. 150 35 45 10 The following is a summary of the account of a typical diving boat . 15 divers 16 pullers 1 Nakhuda Receipts Sales of pearls Rs. a. p. 2,302 0 o Payments Government tax 1/5th share of Nakhuda and financier Cost of food Shares of divers @ Rs. 37 ..

It is difficult to estimate the quantity of pearls found during the season but it appears that the catch was smaller than last year, in spite of more boats diving ; but it was more valuable owing to higher prices being paid for pearls. The price of pearls in Bahrain unfortunately does not depend upon the expenses of finding them but it depends entirely upon the demand for pearls in the Bombay market. POLICE AND PUBLIC SECURITY. Strength. The strength of the State Police at the end of the year was 339 officers, N.C.Os.. and other ranks. During the year five men died, six men obtained their discharge and six were dis missed, eighteen recruits were enlisted. Camp followers including gardeners and launch crew amounted to 36. The strength of the Special Police was 150. The Natur strength was 186. The total strength of trained armed men in the service of the State was 675, an increase of thirty men over the previous year. Promotions. Head Havildar Ali Mirza was promoted to Sub-Inspector, Naik Pirran Ditta, one of the Indian Instructors, was promoted to Havildar and nafar Zaid bin Juma was promoted to L/Naik. Routine. It was found necessary to increase the number of Police on duty in the town at night as a deterrent against thieving. Owing to more men being on night patrols fewer men were a\ ailable for dail\ parades which averaged about 50 N.C.Os. and men on those days of the week when the Police Station personnel were not on parade. The experiment of appointing a certain number of N.C.Os.' and men as permanent town Police, stationed in the two Police Stations, which was tried during the previous year was not found to be a success. A permanent staff of town Police N.C.Os. were appointed but the men on this duty were changed occasionally. All sections took part in the annual musketry course. The section which won the shooting shield obtained an average score of 75.3. The average score of the whole force was 65.5 and the highest individual score was 97 out of 100. Ten men obtained between 88 and 92 out of 100. About half of the total strength of the State Police were granted leave during the year but not more than 29 were on leave at any one time. Leave outside Bahrain was discouraged except in the case of Indian Instructors. Several Guards of Honour were provided by the State Police during the year and usual cere monial Parade was held at the Palace in honour of the late Ruler a few days before he died. Daily parades, route marches and exercises took place on the Kort parade ground and in the neighbourhood of Manamah. The police were trained in A. R. P. exercises and took part in numerous air raid practices, the members of the band attended first aid and stretcher work lectures and lessons during the first half of the year. Mounted sections, horsemen and camelmen, patrolled the coasts and the country from Manamah, Bude} a and Jaw and w ere successful in detecting parties of people making illegal landings in Bahrain. The mounted section carried out night patrols on Moharraq island and on the coast near Manamah. Members of the State Police contributed to the recruitment of the two companies of Levies by bringing in likely recruits for enlistment. Owing to the extreme difficulty in obtaining material for uniforms the sartorial appearance of the Police deteriorated noticeably during the year. At the end of the year arrangements were made by the Defence Officer in the Persian Gulf for the Bahrain Government to purchase uniforms, etc., from military sources and earlier in the year the Bahrain Government was allowed to buy dry rations! rice flour, etc., from the military stores. This assistance was very greatly appreciated by the Bahrain Government and the Police themselves. The health of the Police was better than in the previous year there being fewer attendances at sick parade. The five men who died all suffered from T.B.15 Jail. There was an increase in the number of prisoners. During the year 536 persons were admitted to jail. Prison labour was used for building a pier at Jaw into the deep water and a similar pier was commenced at Budeya. The feeding of prisoners, which was done by contract, costs the State Rs. 7/8 per head monthly, in many cases nowadays imprisonment is not regarded as a thing to be avoided but is sought after by people who find it difficult to feed themselves. Crime. No serious crime occurred during the year. In Muharram a small fracas took place on one of the nights when the processions from the vari ous matems went out into the town. Two processions met in a narrow lane, each refused to give way, and there was a brawl between the two parties. The Police who were accompanying the processions were caught between two fighting mobs. Reinforcements arrived and order was restored. A few heads were broken and some arrests were made. Guarantees for the good behaviour of the partici pants in the procession on the 10th of Muharram were taken from the leading Shia notables and no further incidents occurred. Traffic accidents increased. Three men, two women and a child were run over and killed during the year ; four men and two children were seriously injured. Considering that there were less than 500 motor vehicles on the road in Bahrain during the year this percentage of fatalities was exceedingly high. There was a considerable increase in the number of criminal cases ; 503 prosecutions were made by the Police of which 291 were against foreigners. Last year only 336 cases were dealt with. The increase was due mainly to the large number of persons who were prosecuted for receiving stolen pro perty and for offences against food control and rationing regulations and for traffic offences. A traffic offence which was constantly repeated for some months after the Shaikh Hamad Bridge was opened was the smashing of the shadoof gate by cars whose brakes failed to stop them as the vehicle approached the bridge. During the year 356 Bahrain subjects were convicted and 257 foreigners. One reason for the overwhelmingly high proportion of foreign criminals was that a large proportion of the foreigners had no means of livelihood and were reduced to stealing and other criminal practices.

Owing to ihe war situation during most of the past year and the possibility of air raids A.R.P. measures were taken by the Government in conjunction with the municipal authorities, the police and the state and other medical authorities. An A.R.P. committee was set up representing various local and foreign communities which gave valuable assistance by making useful suggestions and by explaining to the people the need and the object of the various measures which were imposed by the Government. Among the precautions which were taken were the removal of all the inflammable matting roofs which covered the narrow streets in the bazaars. This action has improved the appearance of the bazaar and is more hygienic though in summer time during the middle of the day it may be in convenient. The straw roofs in the past were occupied by hordes of dogs which infested the bazaars at night. Numbers of trenches were dug in all parts of the two towns to provide shelter for the public in case of raids, they were in most parts shallow owing to the surface water existing a few feet below the ground. First aid services were organised and practices were carried out by the personnel of the Government hospital, the police band and members of the Mission and Victoria Memorial hospitals augmented by local volunteers. Electric sirens for air raid warnings and fire bells were established in Manamah and Muharraq. The state police, naturs and fire services were trained in their duties in case of an air raid and boys and girls in the government schools were taught what they should do in case of bombs being dropped. Practices were held on various occasions. In spite of propaganda through articles in the local newspaper and by broadcast and by leaflets the attitude of the general public was incredulous and apathetic. Many people considered that the authorities were for some reason attempting to create a state of alarm. When air raid practices were held the towns appeared devoid of inhabitants as all the people remained indoors in order to avoid having to enter the trenches. At one time however the course of the war and the local propaganda appeared to have some slight effect on the imagination of the people and a number of local notables mostly people who owned cars, removed their households from their town houses and established barasti camps at various points along the coast. Towards the end of the year black out restrictions were relaxed and A.R.P. activities decreased as the danger of air raids appeared to recede.17 PUBLIC HEALTH. Men's Hospital. [By Dr. R. H. B. Snow— State Medical Officer.) Once, two years ago. His Highness Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah visited the new Men's In-patient Block. It was hoped then that only another twelve months would elapse before he would be asked to declare the whole hospital open. Some delay occurred over the completion of the last building, the Administration Block. Nearly two years passed. Two months before its completion His Highness Shaikh Hamad, the Ruler of Bahrain, died. Great bereavement throughout the island was caused by his death, and especially in the hospital where the influence of his friendly interest was always felt. To those who knew him intimately he has been a real loss as a friend, and he will long be remembered for his kindness and simplicity. During that same month of Safar (February) the beginnings of a chain of events were being forged connecting the hospital with the war. At the very time of his death, a scheme was propounded by the Bahrain Government with the Royal Air Force whereby in-patient and out-patient treatment would be provided as far as the hospital would allow. Air Headquarters, Iraq, agreed and approxi mately 50 beds were promised by the Government and the American Mission Hospitals. Events moved rapidly. The Japanese menace was near enough to make it likely that large Defence Units, especially the R.A.F., would shortly be arriving. The remainder of the existing work was pushed forward and completed on May 1, 1942 (Rabi-al-Thany 1361). Further buildings were embarked on—a new house for the Assistant Matron, and accommodation for the R.A.F., a ward of 12 beds, kitchen and ancillary rooms. By June, a similar agreement on a smaller scale was made with the Navy, and a few special patients were admitted from that month onwards. July saw the European kitchen installed and one ward was opened for R.A.F. and Navy personnel. Non-European Army, Navy and R.A.F. patients were also being taken into the hospital. On October i, 1942 {20th Ramadhan 1361) all wards were ready and open for use. One was new, facing the sea on the first floor and the expenses of building were met by Air Headquarters. A few refinements await to be done, and a mortuary will shortly be constructed. Finally the R.A.F. generously conceded still further to our requests by allowing four European Nursing Sisters to come and run the two wards, thereby relieving the already overworked Matron of some very exacting responsibility. They arrived in December. An R.A.F. Medical Officer was also sent to assist medically and has proved to be invaluable. Looking back and reviewing the dovetailing of these events from such small beginnings into an organisation which is running satisfactorily as a routine thing, it is with a certain wonder that so much has been done without hindering the main work among the people of the country for which the hospital is primarily intended. We are greatly indebted to the guidance and ready co-operation of the R.A.F. in so quickly realising the potential value of the hospital which was fortunately just completed to take on this war work. Eventually all Services were embraced in this scheme and admissions were regulated in proportion to the various units. By the end of the year a maximum of twenty were taken in at one time and about 120 patients had passed through our hands. Turning to the other side of this year's work, the chief events of note have been installing a permanent school doctor from Muharram (January) and the opening of the X-ray department. The arrival in April of Miss I. Rodrigues as Assistant Matron and Theatre Sister and t\vo months later the new Lady Medical Officer. Dr. I. M. A. Doeg. The opening of the Administration Block released two valuable operating theatres for use. We were fortunate in obtaining the services of Dr. Doeg and Miss Rodrigues during war time. Both have had a good deal of experience and thoL 18 Women s Hospital which had suffered considerably without a resident lady doctor for six months, has now taken a big step forward again. We have to thank Dr. E. Bamy of the American Mission Hospital and the others who gave their services to keep it going in the interval. The year was a better one for public health. The smallpox epidemic was practically eliminated by Jamad Al-Thany (June) largely owing to Dr. Steele's efforts and only sporadic cases now occur. There was a lower incidence of malaria and some improvement in ophthalmia. Amoebic dysentery and venereal disease remained the same. Towards the end of the year the war was just beginning to affect the health of the poorer classes. A.R.P. work was intensified in the summer months and special classes were held, Dr. Steele again assisting, and the medical organisation for air raids was made more perfect. The hospitals and dispensary were begun towards the end of 1356 (1937) and completed in 136 1 (1942) after nearly five years. It will eventually be named after His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah. The present Ruler, His Highness Shaikh Sir Sulman, has already shown great interest in this work and it is not without a certain pride that he has kindly allowed the hospital to be used for the Services during the war.

The death of His Highness Sheikh Sir Hamad bin Easa A1 Khalifa, K .C .I .E., C.S.L— At 4-0 p.m. on February 17th, 1942 (30th Moharram 1361) I paid my last medical visit to His Highness at Romaitha, when he was exceptionally cheerful and glad to relax there after his recent accession day duties in Manama. I left him after an hour, serene and contented, and very much as he always was. During his prayers at 8-0 o'clock he fell down with a stroke from which he never regained consciousness. After two hours some of his sons, Sheikh Sulman and I had arrived. It was evident that he was in coma due to a cerebral haemorrhage, and a consultation took place at midnight when Dr. Holmes and Dr. Harrison had arrived. Knowing his age to be about 70 and that he was a chronic diabetic with myocarditis only partly compensated, the outlook was considered very serious. It was decided to treat him symptomatically there for at least three days, the three doctors taking turns day and night using his compounder and a trained nurse. The following day a right hemiplegia developed, and the coma continued. Dr. Kennedy of Awali Hospital also came and confirmed the prognosis. The next day passed with no change except a rising pyrexia pulse and respiration rate which eventually rose to 103°. 114°. and 40 respectively. At 12-15 midday on February 20th (3rd Safar 1361), after twenty minutes warning, he passed peacefully to his end. The Administration Block.— This was finished on May 1st, 1942 (14th Rabi/Thani 13^ I )- The ground floor contains all essential offices, a well equipped laboratory with annexe, an air-condi- tioned X-Ray room of ample size and a large air conditioned drug store, and the Matron s store with adjoining sewing room. The first floor is solely a surgical unit and the most successfully planned section of the whole hospital, it is reputed to be the best of its kind between Karachi and Basra. The main theatre is air -conditioned with walls and floor of green chipped marble, and a spacious large panelled frosted glass window facing north. Opening into it on all sides are the essential rooms—sterilising, anaesthetic, and ' scrub-up.' Off the main passage on the other two sides are surgeons' and nurses' changing rooms equipped with bathrooms, the Theatre Sister's office, a nurses utility room with linen store, and another large theatre facing south with most of the attributes of the other, and reserved for septic operations. The whole block is the centre piece between the men s and women's hospitals, united by passages on both floors, allowing surgical cases to be wheeled through with ease, and preserving a certain degree of purdah. The Services.— 25 beds have been put at their disposal. These were obtained from one existing ward of 12 beds, supplemented by a new ward built similarly, but facing the sea and mosquito proofed. One private ward air -conditioned was also handed over. The total aggregate could be expanded to 28 beds if necessary. Two wards, one private ward. Sister's office, sterilising room, a modern sanitary annexe, kitchen and pantry, comprise now the whole European section of the Hospital mainly on the first floor. Permanent hot and cold water, a full number of fans, and some air-conditioning units are also included. Inpatients came in from June onwards, increasing rapid y during August and September, and on October 1st when all was complete, it became a settled regime that beds should be allotted in the ratio of 10. 10. and 5. for the R.A.F. Army, &amp; Navy respectively^ Inpatients were also admitted from Sharjah, Jask, Masirah, and Kor Kawai. 120 were admitted by the end of the year, the chief diseases being, malaria, prickly heat, ulcers and heat exhaustion, jaundice, and amoebic dysentery. Two deaths occurred— one from heat hyperpyrexia from H.M^s ' Alaunia ' and the other from acute cerebral malaria in a gunner from the refinery camps. Su - tertian malignant malaria was seen in its extreme forms there ; 14% were affected out of about 350 with several cerebral cases, only saved by heroic doses of intravenous and intramuscular quinine. The camp sites are close to highly malarial breeding date gardens, which can only be partial y controlled. This outbreak constituted the only serious medical problem. Anti-Malarial Work— About Rs. 30,000 was spent using 25-30 Jamedars, and 80-120 coolies according to the work. All existing work was maintained except that of Sitra which was in March, due to the slackness of the people there. A20 The chief items of note were :— 1. The formation of a sub-committee to lend their practical advice over examining local problems. 2. The closing of house wells in Manama continued. 3. The deepening of the 'Ain Khadhra channel for about 2 miles, which is now draining a large area of waterlogged land between the 'ain and the sea. 4. The old wireless pool drain to the sea was deepened, lined and roofed over by the State Engineer and Baladiya. 5. A large area of land between the Mission and the European cemetery was filled in, to prevent further accumulations of seepage water. f&gt;. One coolie gang worked in conjunction with those of the Refinery in combating the spread of malaria fiom the nearby villages of ' Akar, Neuidrat, Barbar, and Sanad. 7. After the establishment of a force of British gunners in camps round the refinery, the army authorities were advised to take it over. This was done. 70 coolies were employed and several of our experienced Jamedars were lent. A large amount of prevention work was done, but despite this, 14% of the gunners went down with malaria with several severe cases, and one death. On the whole this was a reasonably good year. The incidence was 10% over the whole year m Manama, and 16% during the peak months of May and June. Last year's figures were 11% and 20% respectively. The Schools. Total boys seen. 23870.

Cupboards for drugs were installed m each school, from which in emergencies certain essentials could be taken by a master in- charge. The chief diseases were abscess and ulcer, malaria, coughs and colds, and ophthalmia. This work is of untold value for the next generation, and far reaching results will be manifested in five to ten years time. The Police. 1730 new cases were seen and 3128 return cases. Health was good, except for V. D. and Malaria. The chief outpatient diseases were—abscess and ulcer 240; malaria 233; ophthalmia 134; V. D. 90. Owing to a few cases of phthisis which arose, a chest examination of most of the police was carried out using X-Rays in suspicious cases.

Miss Inez Rodrigues was appointed Assistant Matron and Theatre Sister and has proved extremely useful. She received her general training at the Medical College Hospitals, Calcutta and her midwifery training at the Elsie Inglis Maternity Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland. Her position before her appointment here was that of Matron of the Eden Sanatorium, Darjeeling. The following nursing and domestic staff entered or left the hospital during the year. Female. Male. Trained nurses Probationer nurses Female servants Trained nurses Dressers Probationer nurses Cooks and bearers . Sweepers i entered. 4 3 M 2 left, i », i .. The dressers and male and female probationers all showed great improvement and promise, and it is hoped to start lectures on Nursing, Hygiene, Anatomy and Physiology during next year. Unfortunately some difficulty is being experienced in replacing trained nurses who have left, due to large numbers joining the army nursing services in India. In addition it is difficult to persuade local girls of the right type to take up nursing as a profession. They still cling to the idea that hospital nursing is servant's work.

Ward Equipment. The new European ward and kitchen were opened, equipped, staffed and handed over to the R.A.F. Sisters in good running order. This department is now being used for Services. All were glad of the opportunity to help to further the war effort. LAND REGISTRATION DEPARTMENT. The total number of registrations during the year was 774 which included the registration of about 1,000 properties ; of these one-half were sales and the remainder were registrations of titles, wakf, gifts, exchanges etc. Fees collected by the department amounted to Rs. 10,500, this included the charge of Rs. 10 on every sale conducted by the department by order of the Bahrain Court. The fee covers the expense of surveying the property and preparing plans which are handed to the government auctioneers who obtain bids for the properties.err 27 During the last two or three years there has been a rise in the value of property in Bahrain, this was especially noticeable during 1361. Very high prices were paid for house and shop property in Manamah and for date gardens ; land values increased in Moharraq but not to the same extent as in Manamah. In some cases values improved owing to the construction of new roads or widening of old roads by the municipality. It appears that some of the local merchants who have made money during the war invested it in land and the high price of dates has made purchase of date gardens a more attractive investment than it used to be. Claims for ownership of state land by virtue of long occupation are still frequent. The proclamation issued by the government in 1360 clarified the position but in many cases it is difficult for the courts to decide whether ownership should be granted as the witnesses are not called upon to give their evidence on oath, this being contrary to shara practice, and much of the evidence is worthless. Several claims by the Shia Wakf Department are outstanding as they too are unsubstantiated by documentary or reliable evidence. Bahrain subjects owning only one house are forbidden to sell it to foreigners ; it appears that some people in order to circumvent this rule sell their house to another Bahrain subject who having thus become possessed of two houses is at liberty to sell one of them to a foreigner. Over three hundred parcels of land are leased out by the department from which Rs. 3,600 was collected in rents. Sales of small pieces of government land, usually adjacent to the purchaser s property, brought in Rs. 1,770- The Land Department assisted the military authorities in arranging for leases or for compensa tion for sites occupied or used by troops in various parts of Bahrain and the Bahrain Government afforded facilities for military camps and for the expansion of the aerodrome to the Royal Air Force on Moharraq Island. JUDICIAL. The Bahrain Courts. During the year 572 cases were dealt with, of these 156 were criminal, 177 land cases and the remainder were civil suits. At the end of the year 126 cases were still pending. An arrangement was made by which the court devoted certain days each week to hearing certain types of cases and the two younger magistrates took turn to sit one day a week for hearing petitions for registration of sales and titles of immoveable property. This has reduced the delay which used to occur over registration of land. Most of the criminal cases of importance were offences against food control regulations and cases against persons attempting to smuggle food out of Bahrain. Severe punishments which included confiscation of goods, fines and in some instances imprisonment were inflicted by the court in cases of this types. There was a noticeable increase in juvenile crime consisting mainly of petty thieving by small boys from villages around Manamah who were driven to stealing by hunger. Bahrain Small Court. Over 1,500 cases were heard during the year and about two-thirds of them were finally disposed of. Civil claims heard in this court are for amounts not exceeding Rs. 400. Out of the 1,500 cases only 160 were criminal. Shara Courts. There was a slight speeding up in the disposal of cases by the Sunni Court which gave judgments in 156 cases out of 276. The need for a Sunni Appeal Qadi increases but no suitable person has yet been found. None of the local Aalims are competent or acceptable. Only 47 cases were heard by the Shia Qadis of which 40 were settled and seven were pending at the end of the year. Six cases were referred to the Shia Appeal Qadi who gave judgment in all of them. Since the appointment of the Appeal Qadi, Shaikh Abdulhusain Alhilli, the constant intrigues and agitations which used to centre around the Shia Qadis have ceased. Majlis Tijara. This committee submitted reports on 62 cases which were referred to it by the Bahrain Court.28 Appeal Court. I en appeal cases from the Bahrain Court were heard by the Appeal Court of which six were disposed of. In most cases the judgment of the Bahrain Court was upheld. The amount of court fees collected during the year was Rs. 9,520 and fines amounting to Rs. 7,887 were imposed. Most of the fines were paid by offenders against food control regulations. Comparing the work of the courts in 1361 to previous years it appears that there was a decrease in important civil claims and an increase in petty criminal cases and small civil suits. MUNICIPALITIES. Manamah Municipality. The revenue for the year was Rs. 1,09,000 and the expenditure was Rs. 96,000. The Municipal Reserve Fund at the end of the year amounted to Rs. 1,32,500. The revenue was very slightly more than in 1360. The most important work done by the Municipality, which was paid for by a special grant by the Government, was the extension of the Manamah Sea Road from its western end to beyond the Government Hospital, a distance of about 327 yards. In addition to constructing the road, which is 40 feet wide, a piece of land in front of the hospital inside the road was reclaimed by stone filling and a road from the shore to the new road, with a slipway for boats on the sea side, was built. The new road was still under construction at the end of the year. This wide sea road ten feet above the water which skirts the seafront of Manamah from one end of the town to the other, which crosses the mile and a half of sea that divides the two islands and extends along the shore of Moharraq town till it reaches the open country has now a total length of about 3$ miles. Hundreds of thousands of tons of coral stone cut from the sea have been used for its construction. Other road work done by the Municipality during the year included making new raised roads on the low land south of the town which used to be a swamp. This area which is now reclaimed, has been divided into sections crossed by wide roads and provides the only ground close to the town which is available for town expansion. A number of streets in the bazaar were widened and street surfaces were covered with oil patch. The compound of the Lunatic Asylum was extended and some improvements were made to the ui ding. A low lying area on the south of the Naim district was filled in with town rubbish covered with sand. The Municipality co-operated with the Government in various A.R.P. measures especially by building another 90 trenches in various parts of the town and by removing all thatch roofs from the Manamah bazaar. The usual Municipal services were carried out, fish, meat and vegetable bazaars were kept clean dead animals were removed and burned at Suk-al-Khamis, physical inspections of 20,000 head of eP and I 800 head of cattle were made during the year at the abattoir, repairs were carried out on sewers and drams and the town was kept clean and streets swept daily. The Municipality, principally through its Secretary, gave valuable help to the Government by dealing with the rationing of the Manamah public and by assigning authorised shops for selling rations. The Secretary also assisted in making the arrangements for selling dates in the villages near Manamah m small quantities to poor people, K m 51 ^ 0f f 6 ''r 65 ^ the 8reat inCreaSe in pauper buria,s ' over a hundred persons were buried clothes flrThem ' eS Unng the year aS their reIations ' if an y. could not afford to buy grave29 ^ f The Municipality continued to administer the fund provided by the Government for feeding destitute old men and women and persons genuinely without means of support. Many hundreds o these people received a small amount of food every morning at the gates of the Municipal garden. to The Counc ii met twenty times during the year and the Sub-Committees earned out nineteen inspections. Dur i ng the recent years the Manamah Municipality has increased in liveliness and activity. Besides the successful administration of Municipal affairs, which is reflected in the outward appearance of Manamah town, the Municipality has co-operated with the Government in many things which are not essentially Municipal such as A.R.P. work and rationing measures and in these and other matters it has been of great value. Moharraq MunicipaUty. The opening of the Shaikh Hamad Bridge linking the towns of - Manamah and Moharraq brought before the eyes of public the noticeable difference between Mumc.pal activity in Manamah and in Moharraq. Although Moharraq is a newer administration with less income than Manamah, its area is considerably smaller and it has fewer responsibilities and commitments. It was decided that a more active and up-to-date Secretary was required to cope with the new problems by introduced into Moharraq by the opening of the bridgeand recent developments around the aerodrome he Shaikh Mohamed Saleh who worked in the Education Department before he held the post of Municipal is Secretary was transferred back to the Education Department and arrangements were made to appoint a ' a younger and more active official in his place. In Bahrain the success of Municipalities depends to a far greater extent upon the work of the Municipal Secretaries than in other places where the members er of the council take a more active interest in public matters, id es Municipal revenue during the year amounted to Rs. 49,500 and the expenditure was Rs. 57,000, al th i s included Rs. 11,500 which was spent upon widening the main street from the pier to the Ruler s Moharraq residence. Unfortunately the widening of this important street has been carried out by frequent nibbles and with much expense for small results. It is however now possible for two cars to is pass in most parts of the street. ! S I Improvements to the Naturs office and the head of causeway were made by the Public Works Department, the flagstaff was moved, a roundabout was constructed and the dangerous cross roads at the entrance of the bazaar were made safer by a traffic island on which a traffic Policeman is stationed during the day. e Nothing except routine work, town cleaning, road repairs, street lighting, etc. was accomplished ^ by the Municipality during the year. After his accession His Highness Shaikh Salman appointed his brother Shaikh Abdulla bin y , Hamad as President of the Moharraq Municipal Council, His Highness himself previously held this e post. WAKF DEPARTMENTS. ' f The revenue of the Sunni Wakf Department was Rs. 28,000 of which the greater part was paid to the beneficiaries of the wakfs. Some repairs were done to wakf property and a few gardens were planted with young date palms. During the year there was a certain amount of agitation among some of the Aalims serving in mosques whose property was administered by the Qadis. One or two well known agitators interested themselves in attempts to stir up public feeling about the maladministra tion of wakf funds by the Sunni Qadis. 1 The administration of Shia wakfs continued satisfactorily in the hands of the elected Shia wakf committee consisting of members representing groups of Shia villages throughout Bahrain. Towar s the end of the year the committee, which had sat for over four years, was dissolved and elections were held throughout the country to appoint new members for the committee. The elections were no completed before the end of the year. The revenue for the year amounted to Rs. 25,200.31 A new spirit is evident among the pupils and staff. The school is looked upon with pride and all are keen to suggest, introduce and carry out improvements, A debating club has been instituted, games are well organised, picnics and outings are arranged and the first number of a school magazine is in preparation. The public are beginning to take an interest in the schools. The first Monday in the month is set aside for visitors. Any one wishing to see the school may do so. Normal work is not interrupted. Articles are published regularly in the local newspaper and broadcast from the radio station keeping the public informed of what is happening in the schools. On the 22nd Jamad A1 Awal (18th May 1942) the boys of the Secondary School gave a play entitled ** Salah A1 Din and Richard the Lion Heart.' This was the first time that a play has been given entirely by school boys. It was a great success. Rs. 2,001 was raised and presented to the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund. Early in the year four school boys from Muscat were sent to study at the Bahrain Secondary School and to live in the hostel. Formerly they had been at school in Baghdad. They did not take kindly to the discipline of the hostel and declared themselves too advanced to study at the school. After causing considerable trouble they were sent back to Muscat. As is so often the case, life in Baghdad had so spoilt them that they will always be discontented. Manamah Primary School. The first four classes are in duplicate with an average of over 40 boys in each section. Class 5 has 49 pupils. The maximum in any class is 86. The school was built for eight classes. Two passages and the central hall are now being used as classrooms owing to lack of space. It is now necessary to divide it into two separate schools. Muharraq Primary School. A kindergarten class of 40 was started in Ramadhan. Instead of the usual benches and desks four children sit at each table. Apparatus for teaching is being made by the staff and the director. Classes 1—4 are in duplicate. The maximum number in any class is 40. Hedd Primary School. A kindergarten section of class I has been started here too but owing to lack of space they share a classroom with class I. The maximum number in any class is 40. Repairs were made to this school in the Autumn. The surrounding wall was completed and one of the classrooms enlarged. All the rooms are small and badly lit. Village Schools. Two new rooms have been added to Sooq Alkhamis School and a passage (formerly used as a classroom) converted into a Head Master's Room. This has vastly improved the building. At Sitra the single room used last year has been divided into two and two additional classrooms and a Head Master's room have been built. A latrine has also been provided. At Budeya two of the existing rooms have been partitioned off making five classrooms in all. A latrine has been built there too. No extension was made at Rafaa school. A partition was put in one classroom. As yet there is no Head Master's room. A station waggon daily takes the staff to the Sooq Alkhamis, Rafaa and Sitra schools. All Budeya staff now live near the school. The schools' doctor visits each of the schools twice a week, with the exception of Budeya owing to transport difficulties. Staff. During the year a Palestinian teacher was dismissed for using physical violence on pupils. At the end of the summer term two other Palestinians resigned for family reasons. This left two of the original 8 Palestinians recruited in 1940. A Palestinian from Kuwait, a Syrian from Syria and a Persian from Iraq were engaged for the Secondary School at the beginning of the new term.m fi I i»t|i None of the teachers are above matriculation standard and very few of them have more than a poor elementary education. Classes in teaching methods have been held throughout the year with 'r^rk 0n ! he teaChing 0f En8liSh ' ArabiC and Arithmetic - The progress in English is most ed. There is also a general improvement of teaching methods throughout the four big schools. Books.

Arithmetic books are now on order. Syllabus. The syllabus for Arabic, Religion, Geography and English is now in use in the primary schools. As yet it has not been possible to devise a History and Arithmetic syllabus owing to tack of books and in the case of the latter subject lack of knowledge on the part of the teachers most of stTd 'Tb r; g m0re . a&lt;Wed than the A course for Arithmetic teachers has been ted as the first step in raising the appallingly low standard. The average mark of all classes of all schools on very simple papers at the end of last term was 33%. . . ., Examinatlons - Half-term and end-of-term examinations were held and promotions were The idea that merit and not * d — ~ * From the month of Ramadhan monthly mark sheets were introduced for the primarv and secondary schools These are proving a great incentive to continuous effort. In the Wdar^ School special pocket badges are worn by the first three boys in each class. Games A games committee of masters from the large schools has been formed and a programme of mter-school football and volley ball matches arranged. much so'that ^sort's' f'f 'TV' 0 ' emphasis is laid on the disgrace of losing a match. So much so that al sorts of foul play are resorted to and efforts are made to cancel or abandon a match y s.de which fears it will take a beating. This spirit is fostered by most of the staff who themselves have never discovered the benefits of the discipline of losing a game Only the example of tho' tho are more enlightened can alter this and we were fortunately not entirely lack.ng in thefe Isa the^Im^r ^ ^ HiS Shaikh 'in schools' host el on ^ t if Rato ATTh ^ a , V1S '!; T ' Manamah Primary and Technical -d the taken ^ ^ ^ that S - h a expressed their appreciatT y ' ^ ' in ^ that the y were given regularly at the'sch^s by tie ^RZo^Offitr-'thrire In November 1942 the Director of Education paid a three weeks visit If. &gt; v v inspected the government schools.

These were a little under the estimated figure of Rs. 5,200 because four students left unexpectedly at the beginning of the The cost of educating 1,200 boys for one year thus works out at Rs. 105,000 or Rs. 87/8 per boy per year. The progress made in the girls' schools during the year was satisfactory but no new schools were opened. There was a large increase in the number of students in the Manamah and Muharraq schools, which are now full to their capacity; in each of these towns about a hundred girls were refused admission owing to lack of accommodation and teaching staff. Until more qualified teachers are obtained from abroad the enlargement of these schools cannot be considered and war conditions make it almost impossible to recruit women teachers from Syria. The local teachers are keen and hard working but they are neither old enough nor sufficiently experienced to carry out their duties without constant supervision. All who are capable are already employed. In Muharraq school the new kindergarten classes have been very successful. The school was provided with special kindergarten furniture and the children are taught handwork and suitable subjects. The possibility of making a separate kindergarten school in Manamah for small children is under consideration. A needlework exhibition in which work from all the schools was shown was held at the Palace, Manamah, by kind permission of His Highness Shaikh Sulman. This was the first occasion in which all the schools combined in one exhibition. Ladies were admitted on one day and men on another day. Large numbers of people saw the exhibition and everything that was for sale was disposed of. Some of the work was of an extremely high quality. Manamah and Muharraq schools both presented plays for the Pighter Fund from which they raised Rs. 745. Muharraq school also organised a play in aid of the local orphanage which produced ^ s - 435 an d both schools raised funds for buying clothes for very poor students which amounted to Rs. 485.

This has proved a very satisfactory arrangement from the point of view of discipline and the general welfare of these students. The Muharraq group contains the largest proportion of good all-round boys of all those from the Bahrain schools. Those from Hedd, on the whole, are the least adaptable to the conditions of technical training. The Kuwait students generally have been highly satisfactory, suggesting that much care has been given to the matter of their selection as scholarship holders. The payment of a maintenance allowance of Rs. 5 per month to all Bahrain students has been continued. The payment of Technical School students originated as a wage system related to the output of contract work from the school shops. Remuneration for such work is now separately provided for, but it would not be desirable to abolish the small maintenance wages at the present time. The general standard of the school has improved considerably, due partly to the elimination of backward boys unable to sustain their courses of instruction, and also to the second selective recruit ment (October 1942) in which 27 new students were chosen by examination from among some 50 applicants. The rapid progress now being made by the 2nd year students demonstrates the advantages of rigorous selection in regard to age, ability and physical fitness of applicants. The majority of those who have survived to this stage in their second year are keen, manly, well balanced youths, deriving much benefit from every side of their training. It is fortunate that they are so, for selection is costly in trouble and money. A good deal of success is needed to compensate for the care of the quite large number of boys who in the end prove unfitted for technical training and leave the school after a time, either as failures or by reason of the prospect of immediate remuneration in the less satisfactory kinds of employment. Staff. One of the five Syrian teachers, Jamaluddin, left in the summer after five years service in the school. The work of the Syrians is in most ways very satisfactory and the keenness of the students is largely due to their influence. Their teaching methods still leave much to be desired, but first-rate teaching can hardly be expected from men who probably have never themselves worked under skilful and inspiring teachers. In addition to the Syrians there is one teacher of Bahrain nationality who is responsible for English teaching and part of the physical training. His work is fairly good. A third Workman-Instructor, like the others an ex-student of the school, was added to the staff towards the end of the year. He had worked for a few years in the shops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and is a skilful metal craftsman. The workman-instructors are not given any regular class teaching. They work in the shops side by side with the students sharing the more difficult operations and helping on the beginners. Their presence is highly beneficial. Equipment. New tools and machines to the value of approximately Rs. 26,000 have been brought into the school during the year. Most of this plant was purchased in Bombay at high prices in an extremely difficult market. The machines which it was possible to obtain for the engineering shop are not ideal for their purpose, but they will satisfy the requirements of the instructional courses for some time to come. They are not unit driven in accordance with most modern practice and the erection of the necessary line shafting for them is delaying their operation. This work is being done by the students and instructors and it is very slow and laborious on account of the use of heav \ timber in the structural work instead of steel, which is now unobtainable. It is providing useful experience, however, and exercising the resourcefulness of those engaged in it. It is unfortunate that the acute shortage of metals is limiting the range of practical work in the engineering shop to a \er\ inadequate series of small exercises. A number of basic engineering processes will remain unknown to the students, except through theoretical instruction until the deficiencies in material and equipment aic made good. One of the principal lacunae in the shop is welding equipment. In addition to workshop plant and tools the school has added considerably to its furniture and classroom equipment. This has nearly all been manufactured on the premises at the expense of some Rs. 3,000 in materials and wages. Contract work and standard of craftsmanship. An increased amount of contract work has been done in the school shops during the year. This was mostly furniture and othei woodwork supplied36 Rs t ooo Jo/ r t h prlvate customers - Its totaI vaIue '-as approximately Rs. 3,000, 40 /„ of wh.ch represents cost of materials, 35% cost of labour, overhead charges and t T '} e SyStem haS been introduc '=d ^d is working satisfactorily.

This defect is now being remedied and in the case of the older workers it is proposed to introduce a system of payment by results for all straightforward production work. exercised inThe ^ pzrt in contract work as soon as they have completed a course of preliminary xe m the use of tools and methods of construction. The greater part of the production work e^cr is done by the workman-instructors and probationers. The employment of the latter has effectively raised the standard of craftsmanship in the shop and made possible the manufacture of a larger quantity and variety of trade work. The general standard would be described as that uropean commercial quality of joinery and cabinet making. It is greatly superior to most of the work done m the local market.

Thirteen new estates were dealt with during the year the most important being that of the late Shaikh Qasim Al-Mehza. one time Qadi of Bahrain who left property valued at Rs. 1 ,30,000. The department took over the administration of the share of minor heirs and purchased property for them to the value of about Rs. 42,000. Another estate was that of Salim bin Yusuf Waswasi in which the share of the minors was administered by the department. The increase in rents and leases is due to the additional number of properties which are being administered, these now amount to 300 plots and 40 houses inhabited by orphans and minors. Money is lent by the department after approval by the president and the committee to reliable persons secured by mortgages of immovable property or gold ornaments at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum. During the year loans of over Rs. 36,000 were repaid and interest on loans amounted to about Rs. 4,000. One of the duties of the department is to recover debts which are owing to the estates which are being administered. Approximately Rs. 18,000 was collected, much of this represented diving debts and in almost every case payments were obtained without resort to the courts. Expenditure. Maintenance allowances are paid to 153 beneficiaries from the income of their property. During the year 19 new properties were purchased including shops, houses and gardens. Cash payments represent sums paid to minors on their attaining their majority. Approximately Rs. 55,000 was paid out in loans at interest and Rs. 34,000 was outstanding in loans from the previous year. AGRICULTURE. Difficulties in obtaining food supplies from abroad especially dates and cereals, directed public attention towards the possibilities of growing more crops in Bahrain. The Bahrain date crop provides about a third of the dates which are consumed yearly in the country, the remainder used to be imported from Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Dates are one of the staple foods of the people and the inferior kinds are used for feeding cows and donkeys. Apart from a small patch of corn which is cultivated on the Rafaa plain, and which is of uncertain success because it depends on rain, no cereals are cultivated locally. During the year the Government purchased a quantity of Manitoba wheat, for use as food, from Canada. Some seed wheat from seed farms in India was ordered for planting. The seed wheat was late in arriving so the Canadian wheat, which had been tested with satisfactory results by the agricul tural department in Cairo, was used for sowing. About 400 acres were sown mostly with Canadian seed but a little Indian seed was used on land not already sown when the Indian seed eventually arrived. His Highness Shaikh Sulman and several members of the ruling family planted large areas with wheat especially in the island of Om al Naasan and down the south west coast. In all these places the wheat was watered by irrigation. Numbers of small landowners and villagers bought a few pounds of seed and grew it in plots in their gardens. The results of this experiment will not be apparent till the spring.38 The date crop was good and no cases of date disease were reported. The Government restricted the sale of fresh dates in order to increase supplies of dry dates and forbade the export of dates or date juice. In the Government garden at Budeya various crops were grown successfully on a small scale, these included European vegetables, garlic, millet, maize and lucerne. The lucerne beds were levelled and replanted with very good results. Lack of careful levelling in local gardens is one of the most frequent cause of poor lucerne crops. Grape Vines have been cultivated for some years at Budeya with successful results. About two hundred cuttings, taken during the previous year, were planted out on the Espalier system along stretched wires. There seems no reasons why grape cultivation should not be developed in Bahrain. Lucerne crops suffered from the cotton worm (sihlah) which attacked various districts durine ic summer. \ illagers were taught by the Government agriculturist methods of dealing with this pest. The agriculturist superintended the work in His Highness's estates and in the gardens of many members of the ruling family and visited all the cultivated districts in Bahrain giving advice to the people about such things as manure, water, drainage, crops, etc. Small progress has been made in growing fruit trees. Most of the large numbers of trees which were introduced into Bahrain during recent years have now died, the few species which flourish are those winch are said always to have grown in Bahrain such as citrus, catulpa, limes and kanar Figs used to be grown extensively but a disease swept off most of the trees some years ago and few now remain. The following fruit trees exist but produce indifferent results : peaches, apricots, mulberries, bananas, oranges, chiko, cocoanuts and guavas. Gold Mohur trees were grown from seed at Budeya and have been planted along some of the roads in Manamah. 6 ^ ui mc Ih- ^ f 0 ™ rn, ™ nt ac( I ui, ed 'he military authorities some European vegetable seeds most of which unfortunately arrived late for sowing. Some of the seed was sold to local gardeners who sent eir produce to the Manamah vegetable market where it was available for purchase by the contractors who supply the military forces with vegetables. This seed produced good results though certain pccies were sown too late m the year. Every year more small gardens cultivate beds of European vegetables which they send to market but none of the growers eat these vegetables themselves.

He was a loyal discreet and hardworking official and rendered valuable service to the State The wni r i i ■ department, Ebrahim Ali Khalfan has been appointed Acting Passport Officer.

Revenue from passports which used to amount to over Rs. 20,000 a year is now insufficient to pay for the cost of the department. The number of passengers who landed in Bahrain during the year was 13,743. was due to the new arrangement by which destitute imnii - , ^i m ^ 1360 t0 I0 . ln ^ 1301 were repatriated to their countries immediately without lengtryprlLZgs ^ the 00^° Ba '' rain Bahrain has 8 b^TX^ n f~tod^t pIXr'who'att ''''tT ^ fo0dS0,ne P' 4 * of Q 8 '' number of Qattar nakhudas make a ^ 0 ' A b y carrying Persians to the Bahrain coast and unloading39 them out at sea some distance from the shore so that the boat can sail away before it is caught. The Persians swim ashore and make for the nearest town, when they reach the Persian quarter they usually find friends or relations who conceal them until the chances of detection become remote. To combat this nuisance the Bahrain Government employs police patrols on horses and camels and frequent sea patrols by police in launches. Imprisonment is no deterrent to these Persian refugees from famine who would gladly spend three or four months in jail being well fed at the cost of the Bahrain Government. FOOD CONTROL. In spite of many difficulties there was at no time during the year an actual shortage of essential foodstuffs in Bahrain and prices, being controlled, were considerably lower than in neighbouring countries. At the beginning of the year the Government tried to buy from India a supply of rice, wheat and sugar to form a food reserve. This rice with the stocks then in hand would have lasted for a year and would have cost about fifteen lakhs of rupees. The effort was made too late. By March it was impossible to obtain these supplies from India. This failure was particularly unfortunate because the Government's intention had been given much publicity and was the chief point in the speech made by His Highness Shaikh Sulman on the day of his accession celebrations. During the first half of the year difficulties in obtaining supplies from India were due mainly to lack of shipping space. During the latter part of the year, owing to supplies from Burma being cut off and because abnormal demands were made on the food supplies of India, exports from India to Bahrain were restricted. In the earlier part of the year merchants had to obtain export permits in India in order to export most commodities to Bahrain. In Bahrain they were allowed 10 per cent clear profit on their imports of essential foodstuffs. The difficulties in obtaining permits were exaggerated by merchants into excuses for not importing foodstuffs into Bahrain, the real reason being that it was more profitable to trade in Saudi Arabia and the Trucial Coast where no price control existed and big profits were certain. The Bahrain merchants, almost all foreigners, showed a complete lack of esprit de patrie and from the beginning abstained from co-operation with the Government seeking big profits outside Bahrain and working sometimes against the interest of their country of adoption. Lack of shipping space in steamers could not be made up by the use of local sailing craft, as was done to a certain extent in Kuwait, because Bahrain possessed only some half dozen big dhows suited for trading between India and Bahrain. The owners of these vessels found it more profitable to carry cargo between India and Basrah than to use them for bringing supplies to Bahrain. Owing to a series of bad pearling seasons there was a slump in boat building before the war and the supply of timber had sunk so low that no new craft could be built. Iii the spring Bahrain had sufficient food supplies to last for about six months, though rationing had not been introduced prices and sales were controlled. When the diving season began the quantity of provisions to be taken out by the diving fleet was restricted to a certain quantity per head. The rice ration which was allowed to divers was so generous that a large proportion of it was bought b^ nakhudas, not used for diving but sold very profitably later in the &gt;ear in the black market. Because shopkeepers were reluctant to sell sugar to the public, sugar N\as sold in small quantities in a number of authorized shops controlled by the municipalities. From the stock icturns which had for some time been submitted weekly by merchants and shopkeepers the Gov ernment was able to keep itself informed as to the food position but as only traders were compelled to submit returns was not possible to keep any check of the large supplies held by private individuals who had begun hoarding when the war started. During the early part of the year the export of coffee, tea and piece-goods was allowed, by permission of the Food Controller, as Bahrain was well stocked with these goods. Enterprising Kuwaiti traders, who have always been smarter and more shrewd in business than the merchants, descended upon Bahrain and bought up large quantities of piece-goods which they exporte40 from Bahrain, usually in the name of local merchants who had already sold the goods to the Kuwaitis, and sold at huge profits in the war inflated markets of Basrah and Baghdad. When the Kuwaitis had been exploiting this trade for some time the Government tightened control of piece-goods exports some of which were of Japanese make, as the local market would have to be restocked from India and all shipping space was required for foodstuffs exported from India to Bahrain, Piece-goods of the type used in Persia continued to be exported in Persian craft which brought meat on the hoof, wood and charcoal to Bahrain. At first exports amounting to half the value of the imports were allowed, this was revised later and exports equal to the imports were allowed. Owing to the difficulties in maintaining food supplies through local merchants at reasonable prices the Government began to purchase foodstuffs either direct from India or from the importers in Bahrain. In April the Government ordered 10,000 bags of wheat from Canada which arrived in August, supplies of sugar sufficient to last about six months were also bought. There were incessant complaints from merchants that 10 per cent profit on imported foodstuffs was not sufficient. They argued that the money which they were compelled to pay out in India in order to obtain export permits and facilities, which could not be shown on invoices, reduced the profit to a negligible amount. When the quota system, allocating definite quantities of foodstuffs from India for Bahrain, was being introduced the Government allowed 20 per cent profit on goods outside the quota and 10 per cent profit on quota goods. This arrangement was revised again before the end of the year when merchants who imported under the quota were allowed 5 per cent profit and 10 per cent profit on goods outside the quota. Rationing began in June. It became necessary in order to ensure that people could buy their food at the controlled price and to prevent hoarding and profiteering by selling in the ' blac k market In the beginning the use of ration cards was optional, later it became universal in the towns of Manamah, Muharraq and Hedd. Until the end of the year the ration card system was not applied in the villages. Rationing was based upon the population as determined by the census which was taken in 1941 and upon the amount of foodstuffs allowed out of India under the quota for Bahrain. Unfortunately the quota for cereals was less than the actual consumption as the figure for the quota was based upon an inaccurate estimate. The introduction of rationing in Bahrain was not such a difficult matter as might have been expected. The census provided the information which enabled the authorities to issue ration cards to householders with only slight adjustments, price control was an accepted thing and people were already accustomed to buying sugar at Government shops. Rice, sugar, flour and wheat were rationed. Only certain shops were permitted to sell these commodities and each month the shops were changed giving all shopkeepers, in rotation, the chance to trade. Shops were stocked either from Government supplies or by direct importers who were ordered by the Food Controller to sell to retail merchants. Ration cards were issued on application to all householders ; they showed the number ot residents, one adult being equal to two children. With each ration card a sale order was issued showing the total quantity of rationed foodstuffs which the householder was entitled to buy in one month. The sale card was endorsed by the seller and retained by the shopkeeper when he had sold the authorized quantity. Eventually the sale cards were checked against the shopkeeper's stock and were also used to check the entries in the shopkeeper's ledger. For a short time rations were issued on the scale of the police rations, 22% lbs. rice, 14 lbs. flour and 2 lbs. sugar per head per month but this was soon reduced to 12 lbs. rice, 8 lbs. of flour or wheat, the sugar ration was increased to 4 lbs. It became evident that this ration was sufficient as bakers and sweetmakers in Manamah and Muharraq have always been able to purchase sugar and flour from people who do not use all their rations in order to make bread, cakes and sweets which they sell to the public. Ration cards were not issued in villages. An authorized shop in each village was supplied with foodstuffs from Manamah according to the requirements of the inhabitants of the village. Until the end of the year this method appeared to be satisfactory. Before the war only three or four of the largest villages possessed shops, country people were accustomed to doing their shopping either in Manamah or at the weekly village markets. The opening of shops in the villages will decentralise trade from2^5 41 Manamah and will make the country people less dependent on the town. Another advantage o rationing is that it strikes a blow at the credit system by which almost every householder used to be permanently in debt to his grocer. The rationing system is a ready money system. In August a Food Control Committee consisting of several leading notables not personally interested in the import trade or retail business was appointed to help the Food Controller. The committee was afterwards increased and His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa was made President. Weekly meetings were held and a sub-committee was elected especially to deal with village supplies. At the end of the year the Government had taken to buying most of the rationed food supplies not from any wish to compete with the merchants but because this method was in the public interest. In November the Manamah Municipality took over the work of issuing ration cards from the Food Controller and later the Muharraq Municipality undertook the same work in Muharraq. Tins arrangement was more satisfactory and resulted in fewer complaints. The only exception to the rationing rules were the members of the Ruling Family who were allocated monthly quantities, on a generous scale, by the Ruler who also appointed a junior Shaikh to deal with their requirements. One of the results of price control in Bahrain was that certain goods could be sold in neighbouring countries at ten times the Bahrain price. Successful smuggling out of Bahram produced big profits and various ingenious methods were employed to smuggle out tea and sugar to ersia an Iran Before the war the Customs authorities were constantly concerned with preventing smugg mg of goods into Bahrain with the intention of evading payment of import duty. Exports from Bahram, nof being liable for duty, were not so closely scrutinised. Today the position has been entirely reversed Persons who manage to import goods do not attempt to smuggle them into the country but the police and customs staff are busily engaged in catching smugglers who try to remove foodstuffs from Bahrain in order to sell them where prices are high. In spite of the severe senten which are imposed by the Bahrain Courts successful smugglers make so much money that y risk fine, imprisonment and confiscation of goods.

His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester's Visit. His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester visited Bahrain on his way to India in June 1942. He travelled incognito and his visit was private. He was welcomed at the aerodrome by His Highness Shaikh Sulman and Shaikhs Mohomed and Abdullah and a Guard of Honour was provided by the State Police. His Highness Shaikh Sulman accompanied His Royal Highness to the Political Agency where he stayed the night. His Royal Highness visited His Highness at the Palace where the senior members of the Ruling Family were presented to him. His Royal Highness accepted from His Highness Shaikh Sulman, as a memento of the visit, an ancient Arab sword in a gold scabbard and some Bahrain pearls. The Motor Racket. The excessively high prices paid for motor vehicles in Iraq and Persia and the shortage of tyres and spare parts in Bahrain was responsible for an abnormal boom in second hand cars. Old cars changed hands at fantastically high prices and many of them were exported to Kuwait or Iraq in spite of the fact that it was known that new cars could not be procured from abroad. As a result of the decreasing number of vehicles, especially lorries, on the roads the use of horse and donkey carts, with old tyres fitted on the wheels increased during the year. Poor Relief Measures. Local Sunni and Shia notables decided early in the year to raise funds for the poor. The need for public relief measures was very urgent. Towards the end of the year it was apparent that conditions bordering on starvation existed in many villages especially those not dependent on agriculture. In Manamah and to a lesser extent in Muharraq the poor were better cared for, until rationing was introduced, because wealthy households distributed generous amounts of food to their destitute neighbours ; when rationing was introduced this form of charity ceased. It was suggested that one committee should be formed to deal with the matter but the Sunnis and Shias found it impossible to combine, so a Sunni committee under the presidency of Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad was set up and a Shia committee presided over by Haj Mansur A1 Arayadh. The Sunnis collected Rs. 32,000 from the public and the Shias collected Rs. 15,000. The Government gave Rs. 10,000 to each committee. Unfortunately dissensions and disagreements arose about the methods of collecting money which threatened to develop into a serious sectarial dispute. This was averted by the Government insisting on there being one central committee under the presidency of His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Alkhalifah with two sub-committees, one Sunni and one Shia. The Shias organised the distribution of the food which they bought with their funds in a careful and satisfactory manner, the Sunnis however laid themselves open to charges of favouritism and mismanagement. Gift of Dates from His Majesty King Ibn Saoud. Soon after the date harvest the export of dates from Saoudi Arabia was forbidden by the Government. The Bahrain Relief Committees had before this sent money to Qatif to buy dates. Owing to the embargo they were unable to get permission to export the dates to Bahrain. His Majesty King Ibn Saoud instead of allowing the export, which would have set up a precedent, presented to His Highness Shaikh Sulman 15.000 baskets of dates worth about Rs. 60.000 for distribution to the poor of Bahrain, a gesture which was very greatly appreciated by the people of Bahrain. His Highness Shaikh Sulman divided most of this gift among the two committees who distributed it among the people. At the same time the Bahrain Government waived the payment by the Saoudi Government of the price of 3,000 bags of Canadian wheat which had been supplied to Saoudi Arabia. Bahrain Levies. Two companies of local levies were enlisted by the Bahrain Government and then taken over by the officers of the Royal Air Force Levies. For some time the police fort was used as their headquarters and the men were housed in the old palace west of the fort which was lent for this purpose by His Highness Shaikh Sulman. N.C.O.s from the State Police were provided for training the recruits until the Levy personnel arrived from Iraq. In order to facilitate the enlistment o( ™7 ° f , ,he men , w t ho w ; er f d lvers the Bahrain Government repaid to the nakhudas the advances which had been made to enlisted men for the diving season on the understanding that this sum, about Rs. 3.000 would be recovered from the recruits by monthly instalments. Had this not been done the diving nakhudas would have made a justifiable protest to the Government. The camps in which the Levies were finally stationed were among the many military building works carried out by the Bahrain Government Public Works Department. g43 STATE ENGINEER'S DEPARTMENT. [Report by Mr. W. B. Steele, State Engineer.) Electricity. Units generated for the year 1361 showed an increase of 73,508 over 1360. Units sold for the year 1361 showed an increase of 66,887 over 1360. The extra load connected amounted to 41 KW. The nature of the new load connected during 1361 was as follows :— Lights and fans (336 points) 16,0 Power (motors etc.) .. • • • • • • • • I 7' 0 Hospital appliance 4'° A. C. units .. .. •• •• •• •• •• Refrigerators .. • • • • • • • • • • 1 ' 0 41*0 Revenue from units sold during 1361 amounted to Rs. 1,42,460 as compared with Rs. 1,24,198-14 in 1360. Increase Rs. 18,261-2-0. The increase in demand was chiefly due to increased Naval and Military load. Black-out restrictions were in force during 1361, which very considerably reduced the lighting load. 56 new consumers were connected during 1361. In Manamah .. • • • • • • • • 5 1 In Muharraq .. • • • • • • • • 5 Total consumers connected to date 1673. Maximum load recorded 189 KW. Capacity of generating plant, including standby, 400 KW. Wiring Contracts. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued, 336 points being wired during 1361 as compared with 461 points in 1360. The falling off was due to general trade depression and to some extent to the fact that wiring material is difficult to obtain. Premises wired by the registered contractors were as follows . Haj Salman Zayani 7 premises. Mr. Yusuf al Moayed I 9 Haj Abdulrehman Zayani 2 Messrs. Kohji Bros. .. • • • • • * I 7 The department carried out the wiring of Government and certain other premises as follows Government Hospital-Surgery Block (first floor and European ward). Muharraq Royal Air Force Camp. Technical School—additional load. Air Liaison Officer's house— additional quarters and Offices. Jufair Naval Base^—additional buildings. Main Extensions. («) A high tension (3300 volts) underground cable was run from the Electricity Department's substation near Muharraq causeway to a point adjacent to e u arraq Boys' School at Muharraq. From this point a high tension overhead line was run to 1 c cas 51 e of the Royal Air Force camp, where a 3300/400/230 volts 50 KW substation was erected to supply the Royal Air Force on a two years' contract.44 (b) A low tension 400 volts 3/phase overhead line was run from the Gudhaibia substation to the premises of Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited at Hoorah. This feeder is to meet the new requirements of Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited, approximately 15 KW. Air Conditioning. 43 air conditioning units were in operation during the year in public and private buildings. Air conditioning was again very much appreciated during the hot season, and additional machines were ordered by local consumers. Continuity of Supply. The electricity undertaking has been in operation since May 1930 and the failure of supply due to Power House faults has been practically nil. There has been no failure of main underground distribution feeders or of substation equipment. Financial Position. After meeting all charges a surplus of Rs. 48,761-13-1 was shown for the year 1361. On the original allocations and depreciation rates, this surplus would be approximately Rs. 28,760. As the old rates may possibly have to be reverted to, it is advisable to put the surplus to ' Operating Reserve.' Electricity Charges. In my opinion, no further reduction in the electricity charges can be made at present, as very few extra consumers can be expected during 1362. Notwithstanding the present world situation and the general increase in prices, the electricity charges were not increased during 1361. Prospects for 1362. It is difficult to forecast what will happen in 1362, but if the war situation remains as it is now, very little surplus may be expected. Telephones. The number of subscribers connected to date is 93. The proposed laying of underground mains to assist communication was not carried out, due to difficulty in obtaining material. The present overhead system is working as satisfactorily as can be expected in the very humid atmosphere of Bahrain. The Department is self-supporting. A new 50 line switchboard has been ordered, to allow for the natural expansion of the system. Owing to transport difficulties this item is not expected to arrive for at least six months. Transport Department. The Government maintenance garage carried out the repairing and servicing of all Government \ehicles (29) including those of the Defence Forces and the Royal Air Force. Considerable difficulty is being experienced in repairing and servicing the vehicles due to the lack of spare parts and tyres. Old tyres are being patched and vulcanised as far as possible. Fire Section. The Government Lire Engine extinguished 19 fires during the year 1361—No major outbreaks occurred. 1 4 suction pits fed from artesian wells, have been placed at suitable points throughout the town of Muharraq. Owing to the narrow streets it is not possible to construct as many as could be desired. Traffic Section. • u. I', 16 . 5 '?' 0 f'® 1 ' 6 '' 5 Dc P artment Continued to carry out the registration of all motor vehicles in the State (554) ar,d the testing of brakes, lights, speed, etc. (in accordance with the Bahrain Government Motor Veh.cles Proclamation of 1357). The licensing and relicensing of all drivers was ako carried out by this department, 90 drivers being examined during ^61, out of which 70 passed. Ihe number of licenses issued during the year 1361 was 144. arc St ' li fifed to the carburretors of all vehicles plying for hire to limit the speed to 30/33 miles per hour. Although the standard of driving has improved, this is still a necessity. AU public vehicles were personally inspected by the State Engineer, fn a number of cases the standard black-out of headlamps has been somewhat modified, as certain vehicles, particularly buses and taxis would be dangerous to drive, with so little road illumination.45 The loading of all public vehicles was as usual inspected by the State Engineer, t.e. legal affidavits from the makers were referred to, to determine the safe load that should be carried after taking into consideration the weight of the vehicle and the locally built bodies. Oil Royalty and Government Inspection. The whole of the oil produced by the Bahrain Petroleum Company's field, amounting to 848,325-223 tons, was gauged and sampled by the State Engineer's Department. Also 43 cargoes of refined oil amounting to 344-529'5^9 tons were sampled, tested and inspected. The State Engineer is responsible for this work, and personally carried out all refined oil inspections referred to above. The crude oil shipped from California Arabian Standard Oil Company to Zellaq and Sitra was also gauged, amounting to 5^7793 tons - Records, curves, etc., showing oil produced by the field, and used on the island and refinery are kept at the State Engineer's Office. From the Revenue Curve in this report it will be observed that the revenue from this source showed an increase over 1360 (1942). Financial Position. (Oil Gauging Section). The cost of gauging and inspecting all crude oil and refinery products amounted to Rs. 9,918-1-6. Fees paid to the Government by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on account of services rendered by the State Engineer amounted to Rs. 23,950-4-0 leaving a balance on the credit side of Rs. 14,032-2-6. General. Water Scheme. The Municipal water scheme is held in abeyance owing to the war situation. Until this is carried out, including suitable draining, the breeding of mosquitoes will continue in the Manamah city area. Shaikh Hamad Bridge. The Manamah /Muharraq Swing Bridge (Shaikh Hamad Bridge) continued to operate successfully during 1361. The total revenue amounted to Rs. 37,671-8-0. Total operating cost, etc.. including all charges, amounted to Rs. 8.884-11-0. leaving a surplus of Rs. 28,786-13-0. A statement is attached showing the present financial position. Staff. Since the Department was started in 1349 every effort has been made to train Bahrainis in the work of the various sections. The Department has 82 employees of all classes, out of which only 10 are foreigners (British subjects). SHAIKH HAMAD BRIDGE. Financial Position, 1361. I.

The revenue collected by the Customs Department from all sources, including boat and pearling licenses, exceeded last year's revenue by Rs. 1 ,45,000 and exceeded the amount which was anticipated in the budget for 1360 by Rs. 2,19,000. The higher revenue does not represent an improvement in trade or a larger quantity of imports, it is due to the higher prices of the goods which were imported. It is evident from the ' comparison of principal commodities ' that considerably less rice and flour, both staple foodstuffs, were imported during 1361 than in 1360 but the value of rice and flour imported in 1361 was only very little less than the value of the 1360 imports. Cotton piecegoods imported in 1361 were worth almost twice the value of the 1360 imports but the quantity imported in 1361 was less than in 1360. 1361: Actual Receipts, compared with Budget Estimates.

Throughout the year the Bahrain market retained a fairly large stock of cotton piece goods much of which was imported some time ago. Merchants however hoarded these goods in the expec tation of being permitted to export them and selling at inflated prices took place privately among piece goods dealers. Government restrictions on the export of piece goods caused prices to become lower but throughout the year many of the public were unable to buy small quantities of piece goods at reasonable prices.

Another export which at one time appeared to have possibilities of developing was the export of coral stone which was required for military purposes in Basrah. Staff. The customs personnel was increased during the year owing to the need for more clerks to work on Food Control and rationing. All the persons employed on this work are Bahrain subjects most of them being young men from the Government schools with no previous government service. viz., Number of clerks (Customs) ,, ,, (Food Control) Menials: Customs ..

The total number of Bills of Entry dealt with during the year was 4,521, Steamers Craft Passengers' baggage 2,371 1.635 515 4.521 Shipping Bills. The total number of Shipping Bills dealt with during the year was 7,191, as follows:— Direct Transhipment Over-carried cargo Export shipping bills .. 848 68 6,275 7.I9I55 BUDGET—1362. The total revenue of the State in 1361 was Rs. 39,81,000 of which Rs. 26,21,000 came from oil royalties. For the year 1362 the revenue has been estimated at 36^ lakhs of which 26 lakhs is to be obtained from oil royalty. Receipts from customs, including pearling licenses, are estimated at Rs. 6,10,000 which is about 2J lakhs less than the amount collected in the previous year. Owing to the decline of trade it cannot be assumed that customs collections will amount to as much as they did last year. Revenue from all other sources, amounting to about 4^ lakhs, is expected to produce approximately the same sum as in 1361. The expenditure in 1361 apart from three abnormal items, cost of food supplies and refunds to the Electric account and the two municipalities, amounted to Rs. 30,17,000. In the Budget for 1362 the total expenditure has been estimated at Rs. 36,57,000. This includes the sum of Rs. 6,16,000 which is to be added to the Reserve Fund. The value of food supplies held by the Government at the end of the year was Rs. 7,73,000. This has been shown as a suspense account. It is probable that these funds will be required during 1362 for purchasing further supplies of food but should this not be necessary this sum will be added to the Reserve Fund together with any surplus revenue that is available. There are no unusual items on the expenditure side but owing to the increased prices of goods and the high cost of living the expenditure on administration is generally higher than it was last year. The increase of Rs. 14,000 in cost of Customs and Food Control is due to the expense of main taining a large staff of clerks, salaried shopkeepers in Government shops and transport of food supplies which became necessary owing to the development of rationing and Government owned or controlled shops throughout Bahrain. The expenditure on medical services is expected to be less mainly because the hospitals have in stock a sufficient supply of drugs to last throughout the year. Defence and Protection are expected to cost almost one lakh more than in 1361, allowance has been made for purchase of over a year's supply of uniforms and equipment from the British Army for which Rs. 65,000 has been allocated. Owing to the impossibility of obtaining suitable uniforms or material during the last twelve months the Police towards the end of the year were in a condition of extreme raggedness. In the 1361 Budget Rs. 11,000 was allowed for public relief measures, over Rs. 31,000 was actually spent. In 1362 the sum of Rs. 35,000 has been set aside for this purpose and this will be supplemented by the contributions which are made by the two municipalities from their own funds. Public Works include the building of a new and larger jail at Jidda and some minor works at the Fort and in the hospital compound. As the Public Works staff is almost entirely occupied with military work it is doubtful whether all the proposed Government work will be carried out during the year.n ^ The Times of India Press, Bombay</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024152683.0x000003_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/750/7</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024152683.0x000003</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/750/7</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Government of Bahrain Annual Report for Year 1361 (February 1942 - January 1943)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1943/1943</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-24T00:34:54</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (37 folios)</extent><extent>This file contains an index (folio 240r) which references pages of the report.</extent><extent>Foliation: Folio 238-275.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume is the Annual Report of the Government of Bahrain for the year 1361 AH (1942-1943) and gives te details of the Revenue and Expenditure of the Bahrain State and contains notes on the activities of the various Government departments, as well as the budget 1362 and some particulars of importance which took place in Bahrain during the year.
