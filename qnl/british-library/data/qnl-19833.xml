The ' Atlantic.'' Statement of Claim. [Title of Action.] Writ issued ,19 . 1. Shortly before 7 p.m. on the 31st January, 1900, the brig ' Anthes,' of 234 tons register, of which the plaintiff, George De Garis, was then owner, whilst on a voyage from Cardiff to Branville, in France, laden with coals, and manned with a crew of nine hands, all told, was about 15 miles S.E. ^ E. from the Lizard Light. 2. The wind at that time was about E.N.E., a moderate breeze, the weather was fine, but slightly hazy, and the tide was about slack water, and of little force. 1 he ' Anthes was sailing under all plain sail, close hauled on the port tack, heading about S.E. and proceeding through the water at the rate of about 5 knots per hour. Her proper regulation side sailing lights were duly placed and exhibited and burning brightly, and a good look-out was being kept on board of her. ^ c ... , 3. At that time those on board the ' Anthes' observed the red light of a sailing vessel, which proved to be the ''Atlantic,' at the distance of about 1^ miles to 2 miles from the 'Anthes,' and bearing about one point on her port bow. The 'Anthes ' was kept close hauled by the wind on the port taek. The ' Atlantic' exhibited her green light and shut in her red light, and drew a little on to the starboard bow of the ' Anthes,' and she was then seen to be24 approaching and causing immediate danger of collision. The helm of the ' Anthes was there upon put hard down, but the ''Atlantic,' although loudly hailed from the 'Anthes,' ran against and with her stem and starboard bow struck the starboard quarter of the 'Antbes' abaft the main rigging, and did her so much damage that the 'Anthes' soon afterwards sank, and was with her cargo wholly lost, and four of her hands were drowned. 4. There was no proper look-out kept on board the ' Atlantic.' 5. Those on board tlie ''Atlantic' improperly neglected to take in due time proper measures for avoiding a collision with tlie ' Anthes.' B. The helm of the ' Atlantic' was ported at an improper time. 7. The said collision, and the damages and losses consequent thereon, were occasioned by the negligent and improper navigation of those on board the ' Atlantic.' The plaintiff claims— 1. A declaration that he is entitled to the damage proceeded for. 2. The condemnation of the defendants [and their bail] in such damage and in costs. 3. To have an account taken of such damage with the assistance of merchants. 4. Such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require. Dated the day of , 19 . (Signed) A.B., Plaintiff. Defence and Counter-claim. [ Title of Act ion.\ 1. The defendants are the owners of the Swedish barque 'Atlantic,' of 988 tons register, carrying a crew of nineteen hands all told, and at the time of the circumstances hereinafter stated bound on a voyage to Cardiff. 2. A little before 6*30 p.m., of the 31st January, 1900, the 'Atlantic' was about 15 miles S.E. by S. of the Lizard. The wind was E.N.E. The weather was hazy. The 'Atlantic,' under foresail, fore and main topsails, main topgallant sail, and jib, was heading about W .S .VV., making from 5 to 6 knots an hour with her regulations light duly exhibited and burning, and a good look-out being kept on board her. 3. In these circumstances, the red lights of two vessels were observed pretty close together, about half-mile off, and from two to three points on the starboard bow. The helm of the 'Atlantic' was put to port in order to pass on the port sides of these vessels. One, however, of the vessels, which was the ' Anthes,' altered her course, and exhibited her green light, and caused danger of collision. The helm of the 'Atlantic' was then ordered to b^e steadied, but before this order could be completed was put hard-a-port. The ' Anthes,' with her starboard side by the main rigging, struck the stem of the ' Atlanticand shortly afterwards sank, her master and four of her crew being saved by the ' Atlantic.' 4. Save as is hereinbefore admitted, the several statements in the Petition are denied. b. The ' Anthes' was not kept on her course as required by law. 6. The helm of the ' Anthes' was improperly starboarded. 7. The collision was caused by one or both of the things stated in the fifth and sixth para graphs hereof, or otherwise by the negligence of the plaintiffs, or of those on board the ' Anthes.' 1. The collision was not caused or contributed to by the defendants, or by any of those on board the ' Atlantic.' And by way of Counter-claim, the defendants say— They have suffered great damage by reason from the collision. And they claim as follows :— 1. Judgment against the plaintiff [and his bail] for the damage occasioned to the defendants by the collision, and for the costs of this action. 2. To have an account taken of such damage with the assistance of merchants. 3. Such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require. Dated the day of , 19 .

Dated the dav of , 19 (Signed) A.B., Plaintiff.Vai -'4k &amp; 25 (b.) The ' Julia David.' Statement of Claim. [Title of Action.] Writ issued ,19 . ^ 1. At about 2 a.m . on the 4th day of September, 1900, the steam-ship ' Sarpedon,' of 1,556 tons register, and 225 horse-power, of which the plaintiffs were owners, whilst on a voyage from Shanghae, and other ports to London, with a cargo of tea and other goods, was about ^0 miles south-west of Ushant. 2. The- wind at such time was about south-west, the weather was a little hazy and occasionally slightly thick, and the ' Sarpedon ' was under steam and sail, steering north-east, and proceeding at the rate of about 10 knots per hour. Her proper regulation masthead and side lights were duly exhibited and burning brightly, and a good look-out was being kept. 3. At such time the masthead and red lights of a steam-vessel, which proved to be the above- named vessel, 'Julia David ' was seen at the distance of about 2 miles from and ahead of the ' Sarpedon,' but a little on her port bow. The helm of the ' Sarpedon.' was ported and hard-a- ported, but the ' Julia David ' opened her green light to the ' Sarpedon,' and although the engines of the 'Sarpedon' were immediately stopped, and her steam-whistle was •blown, the 'Julia David ' with her stem struck the ' Sarpedon ' on her port side, abreast of her red light, and did her so much damage that her master and crew were compelled to abandon her, and she was lost with her cargo. The '.Julia David' went away without rendering assistance to those on board the ' Sarpedon,' and without answering signals which were made by them for assistance. 4. Those on board the 'Julia David' neglected to keep a proper look-out. 5. Those on board the 'Julia David' neglected to duly port the helm of the 'Julia David.' H. The helm of the ' Julia David '' was improperly starboarded. 7. The 'Julia David' did not duly observe and comply with the provisions of Article 16 of the ' Regulations tor Preventing Collisions at Sea.' ♦ 8. The said collision was occasioned by the improper and negligent navigation of the ' Julia David.' The plaintiffs claim— 1- A declaration that they are entitled to the damage proceeded for, and the condemnation of the said steam-ship 'Julia David,' and the defendants therein, and in costs. 2. To have an account taken of such damage with the assistance of merchants. 3. Such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require. Dated the day of , 19 . (Signed) A.B., (be., Plaintiffs. Defence and Counter-claim. [Title of Action.] 1. The defendants are the owners of the Belgian screw steam-ship 'Julia David,' of about 1,274 tons register, and worked by engines of 140 horse-power nominal, with a crew of thirty hands, which left Havre on the 2nd September, 1900, with a general cargo, bound to Alicante and other ports in the Mediterranean. 2. About 2*45 a.m . of the 4th September, 1900, the 'Julia David,' in the course of her said voyage, was in the Bay of Biscay. The weather was thick with a drizzling rain, and banks of fog and a stiff breeze, blowing from S.S.W ., with a good deal of sea. The ' Julia David,' under &gt;&gt; « steam alone, was steeling S.S.W . ^ W. by bridge steering compars, or S.W. i W. magnetic, and ^ was making about 5 knots an hour. Her regulation lights were duly exhibited and burning brightly, and a good look-out was being kept on board her. .3. In the circumstances aforesaid those on board the ' Julia David ' saw the green and mast head lights of a steam-ship, the ' Sarpedon,' about two miles off, and about two points on the ,% starboard bow. I he ''.lulia David was kept on her course. But after a short time the 'Sarpedon' opened her red light and caused danger of collision. The helm of the ' Julia David' was there upon put hard a-port, and her engines stopped and almost immediately reversed full speed, but, nevertheless, the 'Sarpedon ' came into collision with the 'Julia David, ' striking with the port side her stem and port bow, and doing her considerable damage. 4. i he vessels separated immediately. The engines of the ' Julia David' were then stopped, and her pumps sounded. She was making much water, and it was found necessary to turn her head away from the wind and sea. As soon as it could be done without great danger, she was steamed in the direction in which those on board her believed the ' Sarpedon ' to be, but when day broke and no traces of the ' Sarpedon ' could be discovered, the search was given up, and the ' Julia David, being in a very disabled state, made her way to a port of refuere. [427] H A26 5. Save as herein-before appears, the several statements contained in the petition are denied. H. A good look-out was not kept on board the ' Sarpedon.' 7. The helm of the 44 Sarpedon ' was improperly ported. 8. Those on board the ' iSarpedon' improperly neglected or omitted to keep her on her course. 9. Those on board the 'Sarpedon' did not observe the provisions of Article 16 of the ' Reerulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.' 10. The collision was occasioned by some or all of the matters and things alleged in the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th paragraphs hereof, or otherwise by the default of the 'Sarpedon,' or those on board her. 11. No blame in respect of the collision is attributable to the 'Julia David' or to any of those on board her. And by way of counter-claim the defendants say that the collision caused great damage to the ' Julia David.' And they claim— I. The condemnation of the plaintiffs [and their bail] in the damage caused to the ' Julia David ' and in the costs of this action. 2. To have an account taken of such damage with the assistance of merchants. 3. Such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require. Dated the • day of ,19 . (Signed) C .D , dt'c..

[Title of A cticm.] Writ issued ,19 . 1. 1 he ' Asia ig an iron screw steam-ship of 902 tons net register tonnage, fitted with engines of 120 horse-power nominal, is of the value of 15,000/., and was at the time of the services hereinafter stated manned with a crew of twenty-three hands under the command of George Hook Bawn, her master. 2. At about 9 a.m . on the 29th April, 1900, while the 'Asia' — which was in ballast proceeding on a voyage to Nikolaev to load a cargo of grain—was between Odessa and Ochakov, those on board her saw a steam-ship ashore on a bank situated about ten miles to the westward of Ochakov. T he ' Asia ' immediately steamed in the direction of the distressed vessel which made signals for assistance. 3. On nearing the distressed vessel, which proved to be the ' Crosby,' one of the ' Asia's ' boats was sent to the ' Crosby.' in charge of the second mate of the ' Asia,' and subsequently the master of the 'Crosby' boarded the 'Asia,' and at the request of the master of the 'Crosby ' the mastdr of the 'Asia' agreed to endeavour to tow the 'Crosby' afloat. 4. 1 he 'Crosby ' at this time was fast aground, and was lying with her head about N.N.W. 5. 1 he master of the ' Asia ' having ascertained from the master of the ' Crosby' the direction in which the 'Crosby had got upon the bank, the 'Asia ' steamed up on the starboard side of the 'Crosby' and was lashed to her. 6. The ' Asia ' then set on ahead and attempted to tow the ' Crosby ' afloat, and so continued towing without effect until the hawser which belonged to the ' Asia ' broke. 7. 1 he masters of the two vessels being then both agreed in opinion that it would be necessarv to lighten the ' Crosby ' before she could be got afloat, it was arranged that the cargo from the 'Crosby' should be taken on board the 'Asia.' 8. The 'Asia'* was again secured alongside the 'Crosby,' and the hatches being taken off cargo was then discharged Irom the 'Crosby' into the ' Asia,' and this operation was continued until about 6 p.m ., by which time about 100 tons of such cargo had been so discharged. 9. A\ hen this had been done both vessels used their steam, and the 'Asia ' tried again to get the ' Crosby off, but without success.

Just before midnight on the 22nd July, 1900, when the 'Emu' was lying in Whitby Harbour, her master was informed that a screw steam-ship was ashore on Kettleness Point. Pie at once got up steam, but was not able, owing to the tide, to leave the harbour till about 1-45 a m of the 23rd. 3. About 2 a.m. the ' Emu reached the screw steam-ship, which was the ' Newcastle,' which was fast upon the rocks, with a kedge and warp out. The wind was about N., blowing fresh • the sea was smooth, but rising; the tide was flood. 4. 1 l ie master of the ' Emu ' offered his services, which were at first declined by the master of the ' -Newcastle ; shortly afterwards the kedge warp broke, and the ' Newcastle ' swung square28 uuon the land and more upon the rocks. The master of the 'Newcastle'' then asked the masti r of the 'Emu' to tow him off, and after some conversation it was agreed that the remuneiation should board the ' Emu ' got a rope from the ' Newcastle ' on board and beean totow After some towing this rope broke. The tow line of the Newcastle then got on board the ' Emu,' and the 'Emu' kept, towing and twisting the - unable to set her off till about 5 a.m., when it was near high water. 1 he mastei ot .he l-mu thon saw that it, was necessary to try a click or jerk in order to get the ' Newcastle oil. and accordingly, at the risk of straining his vessel, he gave a strong click in a northerly duection, and f,&lt;&gt;t '^Th^master of the 'Emu' then asked if the 'Newcastle' was mukmg water, and was told a little onlv, but as he saw that the hands were at the pumps he kept the •hum by the ' Newcastle ' until she was abreast of Whitby. He then inquired again if any assistance was wanted, and being told that the ' Newcastle ' was all right, and should pioceed on hei \ agi, he steamed the ' Emu' back into Whitby Harbour about 7 a.m. 1 , ' 7.

[Title of Action.] 1 At about G-45 p.m. on the 22nd July, 1900, the iron screw steam-ship 'Newcastle,' of 211 tons reoister propelled by engines of 45 horse -power, and manned by twelve hands, lier master Imdudcd^ whilst proceeding on a voyage from Newcastle to Hull with cargo and Dassensrers, ran aground off Kettleness Point, on the coast ot i oiksiuie. 2. The tide at this time was the first quarter ebb. the weather was calm, and the sea was smooth, and the 'Newcastle,' after grounding as aforesaid, sat upright and lay quite sti , heading about E.S.E. Efforts were then made to get the ' Newcastle again afloat by working her engines, but it was found that this could not be done in the then state of the tide. S Ivt about 10 p.m. of the said day a kedge, with a warp attached to it, was earned out fiom the 'Newcastle' by one of her own boats and dropped to seaward and such warp was afterwards hove taut and secured on board the 'Newcastle with the view of its being hove upon when the flood tide made. Several cobles came to the ' Newcastle from Rimswick, and the men in them offered their assistance, but their services, not being required, weie ( ^ eC 4/ At about 2 A.M. of the following morning the steam-tug ' Emn, who owners, master, and crew are the plaintiffs in this action, came to the ' Newcastle ' and offered assistance, which was also fJ 00( j t - c j e wa g then making, and by about 2*45 A.M. the ' Newcastle had floated forward, and attempts were made to get the stern of the 'Newcastle also afloat, and the warp attached to the aforesaid kedge was attempted to be hove m, but the said warp having parted, the master of the 'Newcastle' endeavoured ineffectually to make an agreement with the master of the 'Emu' to assist in getting the 'Newcastle afloat, and at about .3 a.m. a rope was given to the 'Emu' from the port bow of the 'Newcastle, and directions were dven to the 'Emu' to keep the head of the 'Newcastle' to the eastward in the same way as it had been kept by the aforesaid kedge anchor and warp, ihe 'Emu then set ahead, and almost immediately the said rope w^as broken. A coir hawser was thereupon given the ' Emu,' and those on board her were directed not to put any strain on it, but to keep the 'Emu' paddling ahead sufficiently to steady the head of the 'Newcastle and to keep her head to the eastward. This the 'Emu' did and continued to do until about 4*45 A. m ., when the 'Newcastle,' by means of her own engines, was moved oft from the ground, and the 'Emu' was brought broad on the port bow of the 'Newcastle, and the ' Emu had to stop towing and to shift the rope from her port bollard, where it was fast to her towing hook, but the ' Newcastle' continuing to go ahearl, the said rope had to be let go on board the '• Emu,' and it was then hauled in on board the ' Newcastle.' The ' Newcastle, under her own29 [427] steam, then commenced proceeding south, the wind at the time being N.N.W. and light, and the weather tine. It was afterwards ascertained that the ' Newcastle was making a little water in her afterhold. and her hand pumps were then worked, and they kept the 11 Newcasth; 'free. ^ 6. The ' Emu ' proceeded back with the ' Newcastle ' as far as Whitby, and the ' Newcastle then continued on her voyage and arrived in the Humber at about '2-45 p.m. of the same day. 7.

As I read ths F.O. letter the aarae rules haf;e got to meet the requirements not only of ourselve but also of Constantinople, China, Zanzibar, Siam etc. Any amendftents made should, therefore, presumably be of as £eneral a nature as possible ? Taking Superintendent's note seriatim Para 1. I ar. not sure how far th^ addition of ^he words f, or the Judicial Assistant' are necessary. Para 4 of P. J. Order in Council laying Town that the Courts which have jurisdiction are those held by the Consul General or by the Judicial Assistant. The Chief Judge of a Court held by the latter is presumably the Ju dicial Assistant. Perhaps however, it would be be|tter to refer the question. Paraa 6 to 9. Yes, are missing. Paras 15 5- 77, Yes may be extended as sugpesteid Para 88. Yes, I think the addition of the wordjs suggested would be useful. Para 90. 1 do not think so. If the same rules to apply to other part^ of the world L.S.D. will b the simplest for all. Fees collected under these rules will, 1 tabe it, be credited to the Home not to the Indian Government ? The only reason for Lie tloring the PeroIan ^• and I Order in Council in J. Order in Council is presumably to indicate t Limits of the various courts concerned under Ifitter Drder. It has nothing really to do with the India Government 7 Para 92. Ist January 1P1Q would.. I think, be nearer the right date i.e. the date by which the rules are at all likely to be ready. As r^pard? the remaining paras mentioned by Superintendent, I thjnk the proponed changes wcul; perhaps be specializing the rules too much. It in 6,400-3-1° true are ti the ne n(Continuation ot Note, Precis or Draft.) true we have no registrar or marshal but there re no reason why we should not provide ourselves wit (?5) 37 n nrnj h these officials forthwith. I suggest that Ur.Gandhy ^n name be submitted to the Secretary of State as Registrar. 1 do not think the Judicial Assistant could be pro posed as 1 am rot sure how far his functions as a Judge and Registrar under the Rules might not cla?h. //^ Marshal we can apparently appoint at ary time ourselves. k Cc^iy9 ' i - Air-a kZaX' £ /fr / yy j/i 'l j! .a^&gt; PP . fi,4eo-3-if % ^7//.

I do not see how -the course referred 'to by P.R, can be found worliable under 'this new -table of fees which is quite distinct froin it and is fixed in Rupees. As the Government of India instructions relate to Consular fees we need not consider them as applying to this rule of Court and simply retain the fees wherever allowed * without sing any stamp for them especially as no portion of the fees 50es to Government.Under the Consular fee table a portion does ^o to Govt hence a stamp is necessary. P. J.G. 25/9/12 v.c. PloaB© see P .R.'a note (b) and E.A^ note above. I agree with latter to extent that I do not eee how ycu can work fees paid ty Indian stamps into your P.O. aocount. But as regards suggestion that we should take fees without stamps, this seems to re open to objection. What is your own view as to fees under this order, i.e. supposing you were a F .C. Consul on your own, would you consider them to be personal or payable to Go^t. Do any of the Consular regulations bear cn the question. L.B.26/9/124-2 s- H.a.o. f/?. ^ Z^&gt; Ct^-^ F»A. 26/9/12. ^To : Rupee fees could not come in the Consular Account. Secondly,there is no provision in the Con sular Fees Order in Council for any of these fees,or services rendered. They are judicial services and fees. I find nothing in the Consular Regulations as to the Foreign Jurisdiction (Admiralty) order in Council. Some fees w ithout stamps are taken vide Consular Ins tructions pape 69 and 70. I should not consider the fees personal until the Foreign Office had stated whether fees are due to the Judge personally,or to Government. If you do not like to raise this- question officially to F.O.,presumably The Chief Judge,Zanzibar could be written to Ij/0,or I could ask the C.G. at Constanti nople to find out how they would deal with such fees, if taken in L.s.d. in their Jurisdiction. y. /\ 9 ^ y/ f-tfc 9 ''5- British Reoldency and Consulate-General, Bunhire, 6th October 1912* 4^ LL No. Q ■ c v Sir, In reply to your despatch No»7 (22537/11) dated August 17th 1912 f on the subject of Rules ©f Court in the Persian Coast and Islands under the Foreign Juris diction (Admiralty) Order in Council 1910 t I have the hotiour lo otc,ts that I see no objection to the adoption ®f a rupee basis for the aosle of fees prescribed in connection therewith# I have the honour to be f with the highest respect.

At that time those on board the ' Anthes' observed the red light ot a sailing vessel, which proved to be the ''Atlantic,' at the distance of about 1^- miles to 2 miles tiom the 'Anthes,' and bearing about one point on her port bow. The 'Anthes' was kept close hauled bv the wind on the port tack. The ' Atlantic ' exhibited her trreen light and shut in her red light, and drew a little on to the starboard bow of the ' Authes, and she was then seen to bu18 approaching and causing immediate danger of collision. Hie helm of the ' Anthea was thcic- upon put hard down, but the 'Atlantic,' although loudly hailed from the 'Anthes., i an again s and with her stem and starboard bow struck the starboard quarter of the 'Anthes abatt the main rigging, and did her so much damage that the 'Anthes' soon afterwards sank, and ^v&lt;i^ •\\ith her cargo wholly lost, and four of her hands were drowned.^ ^ 4.

The defendants are the owners of the Swedish barque 'Atlantic, of Obb tons legistci, carrying a crew of nineteen hands all told, and at the time of the ciicumstances heieinaftei stated bound on a voyage to Cardiff. , . i ^ m 2. A little before 6-30 P.M., of the 31st January, 1900, the 'Atlantic was about 15 miles S.E. by S. of the Lizard. The wind was E.N.E. The weather was hazy. The ' Atlantic, under foresail, fore and main topsails, main topgallant sail, and jib, was heading about \\ .S.W making from 5 to 6 knots an hour with her regulations light duly exhibited and burning, and a good look-out being kept on board her. . , . 3. In these circumstances, the red lights of two vessels were observed pretty close together, about half-mile oft', and from two to three points on the starboard bow. The helm of the 'Atlantic' was put to port in order to pass on the port sides of these vessels. One, however, of the vessels, which was the ' Anthes,' altered her course, and exhibited her green light. Hud caused dangGr of collision. The helm of the u A'tlcintic was then oidcicd to bo steadied, but before this order could be completed was put hard-a-port.

At about 2 a.m. on the 4tli day of September, 1900, the steam-ship ' Sarpedon,' of 1,556 tons register, and 225 horse-power, of which the plaintiffs were owners, whilst on a voyage from Shanghae, and other ports to London, with a cargo of tea and other goods, was about 60 miles south-west of Ushant. 2. The wind at such time was about south-west, the weather was a little hazy and occasionally slightly tiiick, and the ' Sarpedon' was under steam and sail, steering north-east, and proceeding at the rate of about 10 knots per hour. Her proper regulation masthead and side lights were duly exhibited and burning brightly, and a good look-out was being kept. 3. At such time the masthead and red lights of a steam-vessel, which proved to be the above- named vessel, 'Julia David' was seen at the distance of about 2 miles from and ahead of the Sarpedon,' but a little on her port bow. The helm of the 'Sarpedon.' was ported and hard-a- ported, but the ' Julia David ' opened her green light to the ' Sarpedon.' and although the engines of the 'Sarpedon' were immediately stopped, and her steam-whistle was blown, the 'Julia David 'with her stem struck the 'Sarpedon 'on her port side, abreast of her red light, and did her so much damage that her master and crew were compelled to abandon her, and she was lost with her cargo. The 'Julia David' went away without rendering assistance to those on board the ' Sarpedon,' and without answering signals which were made by them for assistance. 4. Those on board the 'Julia David' neglected to keep a proper look-out. 5. Those on board the 'Julia David' neglected to duly port the helm of the 'Julia David.' (5. The helm of the ' Julia David ' was improperly starboarded. 7. The 'Julia David' did not duly observe and comply with the provisions of Article 16 of the ' Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.' 8. The said collision was occasioned by the improper and negligent navigation of the ' Julia David.' The plaintiffs claim— 1. A declaration that they are entitled to the damage proceeded for, and the condemnation of the said steam-ship 'Julia David,' and the defendants therein, and in costs. 2. To have an account taken of such damage with the assistance of merchants. 3. Such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require. Dated the day of , 19 . (Signed) A.B., &amp;c.. Plaintiffs. Defence and Counter-claim. [Title of Action.'] 1. The defendants are the owners of the Belgian screw steam-ship ' Julia David,' of about 1,274 tons register, and worked by engines of 140 horse-power nominal, with a crew of thirty hands, which left Havre on the 2nd September, 1900, with a general cargo, bound to Alicante and other ports in the Mediterranean. 2. About 2-45 a.m . of the 4th September, 1900, the 'Julia David,' in the course of her sriid voyage, was in the Bay of Biscay. The weather was thick with a drizzling rain, and banks of fog and a stiff breeze, blowing from S.S.W., with a good deal of sea. The ' Julia David,' under steam alone, was steering S.S.W. ^ W. by bridge steering compass, or S.W. 1 W. magnetic, and was making about 5 knots an hour. Her regulation lights were duly exhibited and burning brightly, and a good look-out was being kept on board her. 3. In the circumstances aforesaid those on board the ' Julia David ' saw the green and mast head lights of a steam-ship, the ' Sarpedon,' about two miles off, and about two points on the starboard bow. The ' Julia David ' was kept on her course. But after a short time the ' Sarpedon' opened her red light and caused danger ot collision. The helm of the •' Julia David' was there upon put hard a-port, and her engines stopped and almost immediately reversed full speed, but, nevertheless, the ' Saroedon ' came into collision with the 'Julia David,' striking with, the port side her stem and port 1)0w, and doing her considerable damage. 4. The vessels separated immediately. The engines of the ' Julia David ' were then stopped, and her pumps sounded. She was making much water, and it was found necessary to turn her head away from the wind and sea. As soon as it could be done without great danger, she was steamed in the direction in which those on board her believed the 'Sarpedon'' to be, but when day broke and no traces of the ' Sarpedon ' could be discovered, the search was given up, and the Julia David,' being in a very disabled state, made her way to a port of refuge.

The ' Asia ' then set on ahead and attempted to tow the ' Crosby afloat, and so continue to wine: without effect until the hawser which belonged to the' Asia broke. „ QC , 0 .„. Tr 1. The masters of the two vessels being then both agreed in opinion that it would be necu s&lt; i to lighten the 'Crosby' before she could be got afloat, it was arranged that the cargo from the ' Crosbv' should be taken on board the ' Asia.' , , . , . x i ^ 8 The 'Asia' was again secured alongside the 'Crosby,' and the hatches being taiv n &lt; cargo was then discharged from the 'Crosby' into the ' Asia,' and this operation was continued until about 6 p.m ., bv which time about 100 tons of such cargo had been so dischaiged ^ 9 When this had been done both vessels used their steam, and the 'Asia tried again o get the ' Crosby ' off, but without success.

The ' Asia ' steamed after the ' Crosby' and again hauled alongside of her and com menced putting the transhipped cargo again on board the 'Crosby/' and continued doing so until about G a.m. of the i30th April, by which time the operation was completed, and the '• Crosby and her cargo being in safety the 'Asia ' proceeded on her voyage. 11. By the services of the plaintiffs the 'Crosby' and her cargo were rescued from a very dangerous and critical position, as in the event of bad weather coming on whilst she lay aground she would have been in very great danger of being lost with her cargo. 12.

The 'Emu ,, is a steam-tug belonging to the Whitby Steam-boat Company, ot 6 tons register, with engines of 40 horse-power nominal, and was at the time of the circumstances hereinafter stated manned by a crew of five hands. 2. JustTaefore midnight on the 22nd July, 1900, when the 'Emu' was lying in Whitby Harbour, her master was informed that a screw steam-ship was ashore on Kettleness Point. He at once got up steam, but was not able, owing to the tide, to leave the harbour till about 1'45 a.m. of the 23rd. 3. About 2 a.m. the ' Emu ' reached the screw steam-ship, which was the ' Newcastle,' which was fast upon the rocks, with a kedge and warp out. The wind was about N., blowing fresh; the sea was smooth, but rising; the tide was flood. 4. The master of the ' Emu' offered his services, which were at first declined by the master ot the ' Newcastle ' ; shortly afterwards the kedge warp broke, and the ' Newcastle ' swung square22 upon the land and more upon the roek«. Tl,e master of the 'Newcastle' then nsked the master of the ' Emu ' to tow him oif, and after some conversation it was agreed that the remuneration should be settled on shore. „ - T ,1 „ i j 1 5. About 3 a.m. those on board the ' Emu ' got a rope from the ' Newcastle on board and beffan to tow. After some towing this rope broke. The tow line oi the ' Newcastle ^then got on board the ' Emu.' and the 'Emu' kept towing and twisting the 'Newcastle but was unable to get her off till about 5 a.m., when it was near high water. 1 he master ot Jie hmu then saw that it was necessary to try a click or jerk in order to get Hie ' .N ewcastle off, and accordingly, at the risk of straining his vessel, he gave a strong click in a northerly direction, and erot the ' Newcastle' off. , ^ . i (5 The master of the u Emu' then asked if the 'Newcastle was making water, and Mas told a little onlv, but as he saw that the hands were at the pumps he kept the 'Emu by the ' Newcastle ' until she was abreast of Whitby. He then inquired again it any assistance was wanted, and being told that the ' Newcastle ' was all right, and should proceed on her voyage, he steamed the ' Emu' back into Whitby Harbour about 7 A.M. 7. About 8 a.m . a gale from N.E., which continued all that day and the next, came on to blow with a high sea. If the 'Newcastle' had not been got off before the gale came on, she would have gone to pieces on the rocks. xi i- rxi i i 8. By the services aforesaid the 'Newcastle' and her cargo and the lives of those on board her were saved from total loss. ,,. XT i).

The tide at this time was the first quarter ebb, the weather was calm, and the S3a was smooth and the ' Newcastle,' after grounding as aforesaid, sat upright and lay quite still, heading about E.S.E. Eftorts were then made to get the 'Newcastle' again afloat by working her engines, but it was found that this could not be done in the then state of the tide. 3 At about 10 P.M. of the said day a kedge, with a warp attached to it, was carried out from the 'Newcastle' by one of her own boats and dropped to seaward, and such warp was afterwards hove taut and secured on board the ' Newcastle with the view of its being hove upon when the flood tide made.

The 'Emu' then set ahead, and almost immediately the said rope was broken. A coir hawser was thereupon given to the ' Emu,' and those on board her were directed not to put any strain on it, but to keep the 'Emu' paddling ahead sufficiently to steady the head of the 'Newcastle.' and to keep her head to the eastward. This the '* Emu ' did and continued to do until about 4*4.) A.M., when the 'Newcastle,' by means of her own engines, was moved off from the ground, and the 'Emu' was brought broad on the port bow of the 'Newcastle,' and the ' Emu ' had to stop towing and to shift the rope from her port bollard, where it was fast to her towing hook but the'• Newcastle ' continuing to go ahead, the said rope had to be let go on board the •' Emu,' and it was then hauled in on board the ' Newcastle.' The ' Newcastle,' under her own2.3 steam, then commenced proceeding sonth, the wind at the time being N.N.W. and light, and the weather fine. Jt was afterwards ascertained that the ' Newcastle' was making a little water in her afterhold. and her hand pumps were then worked, and they kept the ' Newcastle free. ^ 6. The ' Emu ' proceeded back with the ' Newcastle ' as far as Whitby, and the ' Newcastle then continued on her voyage and arrived in the Humber at about 2*45 p.m. of the same day. ^ 7.

Trevor, T ,A., Firdt Assistant Resident ( T n ^har^e of Residene: ) Bxshire, Sir, 'With, reference to your endorsement I T o: S045 dated the oOth November 1909, I have the honour to return herewith the enclosures and to make the follow ing observations, 2, If considered advisable with regard to possible future eventualities. Article 1 may read I,This' order may be cited as ' The Bahrein Order in •» Council, 19-'. The limits of this Order are the % islands of Bahrein, including the territorial waters thereof, and any islets within those waters, and all other territories and islands which are the property of the Sheikh of Bahrein together with their terri- torial waters, which lands islands and waters are in this Order ( except when the context requires a different i7 ,0 ^&gt; f. K ' cLifferent, construction ) included in tb.e expression 'Bahrein '. It will be considered a stretch, of the imigination to consider the northern parts of Katar in the expression ' Bahrein and it should not be expressly alluded to , neither should the other island as Zakhnuniah, Ilowar etc; but if allusion this land and islands ^ is omitted in the definition, it night pos ibl3 r tend to raise difficulties in future^ &gt; ■ o • In Article 2 parts should be set aside for powers of Registration and those of a Totary Public VW- 1 t r-; - \jsy I and also for Admiralty natters, 4c ' In Article 5 in the definition of ' The Court ' the words ,, or by the person temporarily act ing for either ' should be added, 5. In Article 6 (3) after the word service in the first line ' British Subjects or Foreigners ' should be inserted. 6. In Article C, (4) after ' said linits ' should read ' of British Subjects, Foreigners and Bahrein Subjects in the regular service of British Subjects or Foreigner^whether suc^ persons are within the said limits or noi' • The exemption for Foreigners during their absence would lead to trouble, and I see no- ♦ I o'S $&amp;) no reason why 'they should be more preferentially treat/ed 'than British Subjects in this respect, I have included Bahrein Subjects in service of British Subjects or Foreigners although in general practice the Political Agent would not take any steps against 'Cheir property except in coimmmication with the Sheikh, 7. In Article 7 and otherwise were used through out this Order the words ' the islands of ' should be X omitted v ( vide definition in Article I Part TI ) • 3, In Article 15 (2) ' or by any British Subject should read ' or by any British or Bahrein Subject', I an diffident about this suggestion but it appears to me it should enable us to prevent jurisdiction over Bahrein Subjects going out of our ha^ids. After claiming Jurisdiction the Bahrein Subject :o'ild al ways handrd ov r -o the S^cikb Fa rrin for action, 9, In Art!clr 19 (4), I am o' opinion t^at the deportee might often be conveniently sent to the country of his origin. Most of the bad characters in Bahrein are Foreigners and especir.lly people from Basrah , Ka.tif, Nejd BJid Persia, Owin^ to the want of efficient Police it is frequently found advisable to expel people from the&lt;BS ■ IbQ, | the ifslands, e:ic\ to senc 1 tliem to 8. Britisli ass ion wot i 1c irifortimate both for the posses? ion anc^, for the deportees. 10. In Article 19 (7) and hereafter where dollar exchange is mentioned, I would be inclined to omit ' ( 459.77 dollars )' as it is preferable to keep rupee coinage as far as possible intact in Bahrein. 11. 'n Article 83, T think the words ' to the ft G Sheiidi oi Bahrein ' raa,y be omitted. The Sheikh aside certain duties for the benefit of certain rela tions, and these relations are authorised to collect what they can ( upto specified limits ) in respect to these goods. The words do not ma.ke the reading of the Article^ any clearer; but the point is trifling. ''n the same articles the words ' the import ant! on etc by law ' may be omitted,, or else a fresh article may be introduced to provide foi TurC smuggling of goods whose import or export is prohibited b: law. IS. ' think a new Article Ho: 31 should be introduced allowing the Court to send accused Iuh.ammadans to the Shara Court. ' have gone into the advisability ol this more full: para ' v , and there''or^ here onl: insert how T think the article r 5 !• might-j. 0* • / - K^) Tnik'lit be worked. .''i Article 51. ' Mienever boint-j a Britie Subject or. Foreigner ^is accused oi sr. offence, the Court i!ia3 r / if it tilings fit deal with the case, or it jpBr r senc 1 the accused for trial tcillhe Oazi. T n such /V cases the final order of discharge or p^iishment if sz'Z y will be issued br the Court. An A^enc:, representative wo^.ld attend the Court of the Qazi. Tf it is not considered advisable to allow British Subjects to ^o, ~ would still most a stromal: advise that this or similar sectio:: ua^, be at least made applicable to Toreigners. 13. In Article 41 (?.) , ' Consular Seal ' should ■ r. •V read ' Court Seal 11 • 14. In para I have discussed the Lo^al Majlis for Civil Cases, and here I would only note * that some provision should be lade to enable t-e Court to send -ases for decision to this Lo~al Majlis, T would suggest a new Article after tbe ^present Article No: 41 worded approximately ' ^ Civil Suits vjic X otber matters pertain- p. ;■ fr'y &amp;v. - .thereto filed in the Court of the Politi-al Agent &lt; by British Subjects or Foreigners against other British Subjects or Foreigners^.maj be taken up and determined07 [ j 1 / determined hz r or may he cent by rHb® to tlie a Lo^al 'ajlic or Qazi for determination.

The Court may then sign and seal its assent to the -onseusus of opinion, or nar write a fresh judgement if it differs. Su^h signature or su^h fresh dc&amp;icLy' judgement shall be considered for all purposes„the • same p . s if the Court had heard and determined the suit itself. ' Note r have inserted or ' .^azi ' for ^ases of inheritance and other similar ^ases in whi^h Muhammadan opinion is in favour of the ^ase being s settled b' Shara Law. An extra Article in fallowing strain may be added. 15. ' Cases between }avers and ITakhudas, and generalI3' all ^ases -onne^ted with pearl fishing, ma^' 0( 1 &lt; y be sent to the Salifa Court '. c- : 0'-e The Salifa Court is the recognised Court for settlement of all pearling disputes between T asters, rivers, and Saibs ( people who pull up the divers. ) The10% The Sal if n. Law Iz not, laid down in my particular hook, and Iz nore 'traditional 'than any thing elce. Although it i. generally in favour of the ^Taster, yet the rule : are fairly well understood by * all parties, and the presence of an Agency Represent ative prevents unjust depJL'Lna-- . A report of ea^h ^ase is given the Poii 'i ^ a 1 Agent who order a JT^trial 4 (tf an^^thlng improper appear to have o^-nirred. Any change in these natters would meet with serious opposition and dr. content. To British Subject are involved, the foreign Mvers being Persipjis, TTajdis, Koweitis, and Easris, 16. In Article 42 (1), a ^omm.a should be intro duced after ' or foreigner ' in the second line. I do not thinly that 5^' Article 42 (S) is ne^escary. 17. It 'wr.s stipulated in the letter of Shei 1 - 7 :! 1 Esa dated the loth July 1909, whi^h wac forwarded wit rr^' letter 'To: C 2 dated the 17th T uly 1009 that -ases between Eabreinic and Poreignerc should be settled jointly. If therefore the Sheilsh does not give his 'oncent in writing as proposed in Article 42 (2), I assume the Political Agent will ma'ce su-h arrangement as seems most feasible for the particular 'ase.I wm ? i0 \ 18. I read Ar^i'-le 42 (2) ac referring a t 1 I; ^ Eal^reln Subject, whether in 'the ^apa^ity of Plaintiff ^afir^nv or Vl efen(iant f when-Brvtii^ Subje^te are plaintiffc there i f :. lecc lively to be difficulty than when they r.re »defend?nte. pjid I think Sheikh Eza would pra^t i-^all^ pvlwac^- give hi f : ^onrj.ent. He likec hie cub J e ^tc to go through him ac it enhancec hie dignity and at the came time enables him to levy toll on the proceeds in Civil Suite.

The Bahrelnls who have taken up their abode in Lingah,Mahoramerah,Basrah and Baghdad 0 and who stll keep up their connection with Bahrein and have property and other interests here,arel considered as Bahrein subjects,but all other nationalities come under our protect ion and can in no way be touched by the Sheikh, or by any of his officials. In criminal cases,Foreigners are brought to the Agency for orders, and in Civil suits no orders can be passed against them without the concurrence of the Agency. They cannot be taken to the Sheikhs Courts without permission neither can oukhra (forced labour) be levied on them nor in fact can anything to their detriment be done by any of the Sheikhs or their officials. It has been my opinion that such complete jurisdiction cannot fail to have made a bad impression in Koweit, as Colonel P.2.Cox,C.S.I.C.I.E. Political Resident,Bushire.i uK: from outsiders point of view this juriscliction only means the beginning of final annexation, ana Shaikh is,I think, /i looked upon by them as having no independence whatever. S. The difficulty is however to differentiate between foreigners. I would make the following proposals, but you will probably first like to see the actual status at your next visit. &lt;cC) complete jurisdiction over non Asiatics,and over British Indian subjects or other British proteges including manumitted slaves. I believe that a system of Registration would be advisable provided this would not be objectionable to J 4 (( Io ' e lsn lowers, but In any case such Registration may stand over until our protection has been formally declared after Issue of the Orde? In Council. (b) oomplete Jurisdiction over Asiatic Turkish sub- jeats and over Persians,provided that are reglter- A j* ed In the Agency as such. Those who are not re gistered will be entitled to our good offices / ould t-u^, a., ply for such,but whene they do not apply we cannot be expected to force It In any way (c) (rood offices to Oman,Katar,and Kowelt subjects. (d) .0 protection to Independent Arab tribesmen. 3. There are no doubt objections to this system,and I think the chief Is the retrogression In our present powers.i-'- 1^3 | is yjhether or not our prestige would be effected thereby much better known, to you and I would refrain giving any opinion. f^i'CctUa Secondly there would be trouble with the Sheikh's until the regime was fully understood,but I anticipate no serious difficulties. 4. I think that the only other principal point is that whatever happens^ Shara Law should interfered with as little as^pp^sible by our assumption of jurisdiction,but I have gone more fully into this in my official letter. With reference to Article 31 of the liraft Order,as far as I know/original jurisdiction with a Id strict Judge is MO,000. I am about certain it would be acceptable to the merchants if there were no limit to the value of the Political Agent's original jurisdiction,as otherwise it would necessitate their filing suits in Bombay. I do not make this suggestion in order to invest the Political Agent with higher powers than is intended,but big pearl cases can,with due respect to the High Court,be more profitably compromised to both parties satisfaction in Bahrein than^ 15^ Confidential - , x VO POLITICAL AGENCY Bahrein,S3rd April 1910, With reference to my D /0 dated the 9th April regard ing jurisdiction in Bahrein,! am,on still further consider ation, of opinion that it will be advisable to allow our .jurisdiction over foreigners to remain complete as at preset I think there is a good deal to be said from both points of view,and undoubtedly jurisdiction over a mass of low class foreigners is a great nuisance. Still on the other hand it would seem a great pity to break down the system which Prideaux spent so many years jC in building up,and I thin now that whatever harm has been done in other parts of the Gulf by this action,has fully sunk in and would not be altered by a partial laxation of jurisdiction. It has now probably been accepted as a 'fait accompli' Colonel P.Z.COX,C.S.I.,C.I.B. Political Resident,Bushire.rv r gjid has ceasecl 'to call for any special no'ticfc!. With regard to the difficulty you foreshadowed about being responsible for collection of debts from other places I see no reason why we should be responsible for any except those of British, and Bahrein subjects,and our good offices in these cases would not I think be altered in any way by our assumption of jurisdiction over foreigners when in Bahrein. As regards internal influence over the Chief of Bahrein,complete .jurisdiction is certainly preferable, I regret offering these conflicting views, and hope S,' you will excuse me #J \ ^io..3134 of 1910.

Sir, i hava the honour to refer to tha oorretspondance ending with Forei^ Department Letter Ho. 1-G dated 16th November 1909, enclosing a preliminary draft of the proposed Order in Council for Bahrain, for examination and commjnt. -. with the concurrence of the foreign Department, tha subject was held over pending ray return from leave in the Gprinfe and subsequently the dissection of the draft disclosed so many points requiring full discussion between the Political Agaftt and myself that a great deal of time lias necessarily been ex pended and I am only now able to submit the result to Govern ment for favour of further scrutiny. It comprises the joint views of myself. Captain Mackenzie and :-ajor Prideaux who, as Agent at Bahrein from 1904 to 1909 has been chiefly and credit ably identified -vith the marked consolidation of our position wiiich has taken place since tha presentation of the Ultimatum to shaikh jisa in February 1905. i5. it will be remarked tiiat a good many alterations hnva been suggested, but I trust that I am not mistaken in thinking that II5T %) in 1 or warding th .0 drsit for comnient the (iovarnnant of India ■&gt; realised that considerable modifioations might be necessary in order to meet peculiar local conditions; and in that belief I have ventured to regard the draft rather as having been sent us as a wording basis than as a definite assertion of the views of Government even in regard to fundamental points, 4. As regards most of the alterations suggested, I beg that thei annotated copy now submitted with this letter may be accepted as ■ in itself supplying the needful explanation^ of our views in points 01' detail. There are certain primary questions, however, • which it is necessary tliat I should touch upon here, including the two subjects specially referred to in the Foreign Department communication abovementioned, namely the question of the position • or foreigners as regards jurisdiction undel? the Order, and the need for Registration, 5. In the Foreign Department draft the definition of 'Foreigner' 1 jaa worded, 'A subject or citizen of a state in amity with His Majesty, other than Bahrein'. It is now suggested that it be al tered to, 'Any person not a subject of Bahrein'; the reason for the suggestion being that there are denominations among the in habitants and frequenters of Bahrein of whom it can hardly be said that they come within the former category. Under present conditions the term 'Foreigner' in Bahrein em- oraces the following denominations in practice (i) Subjects of Christian Powers, (ii)SubjeGts of Turkey and Persia and other non -Christian Powers, ^ili) Dependents of petty uohammedan Rulers on the shores or hinterland of the Uulfs of Persia and Oman, such as the rrucial ooa^t siiaikhs and the Ruler of i^oweit, enjoying a greater or less measure of protection from the British Government, ^ J v ^ Natives O j . ivatar or other semi-independent tracts ntt enjoying any measure of British protection outside Bah rein. Since the events of the winter of 1904-1905, ending with the 1. o Z uij to Shaikh Ksa and the deportation of his nephew shaikh • Ali bin Ahmed, the protection or good offices of the Agency have beenn been extended when aeJted to persona of all the above oatefcorles, and the uaage has so far received the rjoognition and aoqules- cenoe the iihaikh, that his officials are now in the habit of bringing members of them spontaneously to the British Agency for the investigation and adjustment of thjir claims. This development operates greatly in our favour, as enhanc ing our gooa name and influence among the trading classes of the Oulf and enabling the latter to obtain a measure or even- nanded justice which otherwise they could hardly hope to get. it operates especially in favour of the diving fraternity, an oppressed and deserving class, who can now count upon getting 'air treatment at the hands of the Salifah Court, which, but for our good offices, would often be denied them. it -ill be understood, however, that under this comprehensive doixnition or the term Foreigner, the onus of protection which has gradually been forced upon us and of which we can hardly now divest , ' S ourselves, becomes a somewhat heavy one, and necessitates in Ey judgment, the provision of a system of Registration for the res- '.riction and control of it. un these grounds a set of regulations for f ,i Oration has been included under which a Foreigner, while in any case subject to j a.' I:., , ict , ion or the Agency when necessary, ./ill not be ontitled 10 olaim it unless registered, m paragraph u or the Foreign Department coimaunlcation under reply it ./as stated that reference to jFegistration had provision- ally been omitted on the ground that the Political Agent does not * ,rJr ' ° G Uon3ular powers, but as my opinion was asJced on the sub- x presume that the application of regulations for'geftistra- tion by a political Agent is not considered wholly impracticable , on any tedinical grounds. The third fundamental modification vfhlch has been suggested //hioh needs explanation here concerns the quarter to which -PPaals shall lia from the Court of the Political Agent at Bah- rein. -xi -iiij oonneotion it will be noted that in lett x.\( I ' 1 V / l/S or a5th i^abruary 1900 and in Governnont of India Letter Uo.l-G 188 (Secret iixternal) of 14th November 1907 to uis majesty's becretary or State, it was suggested that the District Court at Bahrein should be subordinate to the High Court at Bombay. -lose examination or this question, however, from all points of view has brought the Political Agents and myself to the unanimous opinion that it will be against the interests of the Bahrein community and our political Interests, that Appeal should lie to the high Court, and it is therefore hoped that thu uovernment or India will see their way to recommend that i. Court oi the Resident in the Persian (iulf be constitiited the 'Chief Court' for purposes of appeals under this Order♦ x submit that the grounds in favour of the adoption of this c-urse are cogent. firstly, it may be claimed under .article 4 of friendly Con vention of 1661 with Bahrein, and by right of well -established usage since, that disputes between British subjects and de pendants (now including foreigners since the ultimatum of 1905), ind Baiireinis on the other hand, are subject to the decision of ihe political Resident should the British Agent and Local Autho rities fail to settle them satisfactorily. secondly, the general understanding prevailing among the iiari- time Arabs is that the Resident is the Chief Authority empowered -o settle all ti^eir dispmtes in the Gulf. Reference to the Bombay uigh Jourt with the contingent possibility of the Resident's de- cision being upset will tend to lower the prestige of the powers Ox intervention -vhich he exercises by dispensation from Govern- munt. The high Court is greatly disliked by uulf Arabs on ac- /tpimt of the long delays involved in settlement of suits therein; the heavy expenses entailed by the eiaployment of Pleaders, and the practical impossibility for principals to attend in person. Xhe distance separating Bahrein and Bombay and the slowness of communication would inevitably nilitate against the ends of prompt justice which is the only form of the commodity which the commu- ioy appreciates. Great difficulty, expense and loss of time would bebe incurred by sending wltneases and partiee from Bahrein to -embay, in faot It would very often be practically impossible to obtain the attendance of witnesses. Appeal to the High Court might not be so fraught with object ion wore British subjects the only people involved, as the Hindoo Firms often have representatives in Bombay, but it Is nciesirable to force such procedure on Bahrein subjects and Foreigners, and were it done, the native public would undoubtedly prefer the crude and uncertain Jurisdiction of the Shaikh to our own. 7. in dealing with the section of 'Bahrein subjects and Tri- bunala' it has been no easy matter to devise articles which will locallj, ./oiiwd.ole in practio», be compatible with the exi gencies of an order in Council. - need only say here that the articles now suggested are the result or much deliberation between the Political /.gents and uyself ind will we believe amy meet requiramenta. respectfully commending the draft now submitted to the wise - i a or at ion of Government,Ho.

To The Right Hon'ble the EARL of CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla; the 8th June^ 191U My Lord, With reference to Lord Morley's Secret despatch, No, 11, dated the 21st May 1909, we have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty's Government, the correspondence detailed in the annexed schedule in regard to the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. 2 The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has procured from the Sheikh of Bahrein a request in writing Tide enciosnre No. 2. , be re ii e yed by the British Government of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his territory. We consider the document valid enough for the purposes for which it is required, as it distinctly surrenders all civil and criminal jurisdic tion over foreigners in Bahrein to the British Government. We, therefore, recommend that the Political Resident may be empowered to inform the [ Sheikh that following thereon, the needtui provision has been made by His Majesty's Government. 3 We also submit, for Your Lordship's consideration, a draft of the proposed Order, and would draw attention to the following specific recommend- ations made bv our Political Resident Vide enclosure No. 4. in the -pevsinn Gulf, VIZ. : — (а) the definition of the expression ' Foreigner (б) the need for a set of regulations for Registration, and (c) the necessity for the Court of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf being constituted the ' Chief Court' for purposes of Appeals under the proposed Order. As we agree in substance with the views expressed by the Political Resident the Order has been drafted to include provision covering the points detailed above. But in respect of the grant of the powers of a ' Chiet Court to the Political Resident, in preference to subordinating the Bahrein Courts to the Hi^h Court at Bombay, we would, in drawing attention to the views expressed on a similar consideration in connection with Somanland in naraffraph 4 of Lord George Hamilton's Political despatch, ^o. 28, dated the 8th April 1897, mention that the Political Resident will be instructed by letter that. when exercising these powers he must hold his Court within the limits of -the Order. Similarly the Judicial Assistant to the Consul-General for Ears and the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf, and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to whom special powers are to be given, will hold his Court,when required, within the limits of the Order. We do not consider that any inconvenience will arise by the adoption of this course as it is not likely that either of the officers will he absent from Bushire together, or that they will be required to hold their respective Courts in Bahrein frequently. 4. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has further intimated that it would be advisable, if possible, to extend the provisions of The Foreign Jurisdiction (Admiralty) Order in Council, 1910 to Bahrein. The point is accordingly submitted for the orders of His Majesty's Government, as also are the views expressed by the same officer, in his telegram No. 367, dated the 19th Vid. enclosure No. 6. April 1911, that the Political Agent, Bahrein, should be empowered to perform the functions of a Notary Public, as was recommended by the Government of the Right Hon'ble the Earl of Minto in paragraph 5 of their Secret despatch No. 188 (External), dated the 14th November 1907. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) HARDINGE of PENSHURST. O'M. CEEAGH. GUY FLEETWOOD WILSON. J. L. JENKINS. R. W. CARLYLE. S. H. BUTLER.

Sir, In continuation of previous correspondence ending with the letter of this Office dated the 18th April last, communicating copy of the Viceroy's telegram of 13th April 1911, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter^ from the Government of India submitting a draft of the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein.

J - that Government were requested to prepare the draft in the first instance. As regards what is said in the second paragraph of their letter, r I am to observe that the Marquess of Crewe sees no reason to question the capacity of the Sbeik to divest himself of his responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his territory, or the effective ness for its purpose of the document that he has signed as between the Sheikh and the British Government. But the question still remains whether the jurisdiction could safely be exercised over subjects of foreign civilized powers without the assent given generally or in the particular case of the power concerned. On this point the Secretary of State will be glad to receive the opinion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs before he proceeds further. The terms of the draft Order will, doubtless, receive the careful attention of Secretary Sir E. Grey, but Lord Crewe, as at present advised, sees no reason why they should not be agreed to, and he accepts the conclusions of the Government of India on the special points referred to in paragraph 3 of their letter. He would also suggest that, if Sir E. Grey sees no objection, ' the Foreign Jurisdiction (Admiralty) Order in Council 1910,' be extended to Bahrein, and the Political Agent be empowered to perform the functions of a Notary Public. Sir E. Grey will be able to judge whether this power will be best conferred on the Agent by the Order in Council or by separate notification.

Sir t I am diractcd 'by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to aoknow- - V* ledge the receipt of your lettersof Hay 83rd and June 15th, relative to the proposed amendment of the Persian Coast and Islands Order- in -Counoil and of the 24th ultimo, relative to the proposed Bahrein Order in Council* As regards the former of these two questions, while Sir S* Orey recognises that the suggestions of His Majesty^ Consul Oeneral at Bushire, if carried into effect would greatly simplify the complicated system by which British Jurisdiction is at present exercised in those regions, he nevertheless considers them msrsly as palliatives which will leave the situation improved indeed, but still far from ^ 9 simple or satisfactory. There is, in Sir BL Grey*s view, little to be gained in the long run by such partial amendments to a system which requires more drastic treatment if it is ever to be made to work smoothly and efficiently. The lines on which, in his opinion, this question \ should The Under Secretary of State, India Office.. -n,: should d«»lt with ar« to r«nder tho political and judicial spii^res o.t th# Political Rssidsnt in tha Persian Gulf coin** cident by putting in force a Paraian Gulf Ordar in Council proriding for tha axaroiaa of juriadiction in all tha tarri** toriaa bordaring upon tha Oulf in ^hich adninifltrativa con ro 1 is ^rsa ed in tha Haaidant and oonaa^uantly aupar^ ^ 3 existing Saraian Coaata and Xalanda/Muacat Ordara and randaring auparfluoua tha oontamplatad aaparata Ordar I for Bahrain.

' W m E, Grey would Da glad to receive an expression of | the■ e v u the Marquw of Creweopinion on thia suggestion. As regards the proposed Bahrein Order t X am to state that Sir M. Orey will abstain from obserrations on points of detail pending a decision of the question shether a oom- prehensiTS Order on the lines suggested abore is feasibls* With referenoe however to the point raiaed in the saoond paragraph of your latter, Z an to state that, In Sir 1. Orey'a rlew, Bahrein, apart from the treatiae into which it haa entered with Hia Majesty's GrOTernment, is a Bovereign and independent ^tate and the Sheikh is thus entitled to exercise jurisdiction oyer foreigners within its boundaries. He Id atao entitled to delegate to His Majesty's Government m by treaty, jurisdiction oyer auoh foreignersjand that treaty 7ould Qoome operative and would transfer suoh Jurisdiction whether acquiesced in or accepted by or notified to foreign Oovemmenta or not% Sir K. Grey considers that the Sheikh has already, by his letter of July 16th, 1909, the terns of which are quite clear, transferred to His Majesty^ Government jurisdiction over foreigners in his dominions and that, if the Government of any foreign Power object, the only ground on which they i lc case their objection would be the ground that thia juriadiction waa not the Sheikh 's to grant, while if they failedvs&gt; failed to show that they thamselves had received by treaty a grant of Jurisdiction over their own subjects in Bahrein, they could not, it appears, claim that the Jurisdiction did not belong to the Sheikh and that he had no po^er to grant it to His Majesty's 'yovemment. I am to add that Sir Grey would be glad to be furnished with copies of such treaty provisions as exist giving His Majesty^ Government the right to exercise Jurisdiction over British subjects in Bahrein.

The British representative is in regard to all these practically in the position of an Agent of xxpkh the Protecting Power rather than the head of a Diplomatic Mission to one or more foreign Courts*. On Persian side the British representative is merely a Consular Officer acredited amongst others to a nominally civilized foreign Government in direct relations with the Great Powers. In my judgment the dissimilarity of local administrative condition will ma^e it impracticable to devise a common order to embrace both the Persian and Ara- biap. littoral 7 ile such an arrangement would, from a political point of view, be open to strong objection. The proceedings in the current Abu Musa dispute for example demonstrates clearly enough the importance of maintaining the distinct and unassailable position of the Government of India and their representative in relation to the other * principalities. Secondly• I know of no further authority but submit that the fol- lowing is sufficient. Our right of jurisdiction over British subjects at Bahrein rests on the prescriptive right of generations unchallenged by the SheiJth and confirmed by,the Convention / Cry^ o£ 31at May 1861; and also indirec 7that Bahrein has • 1 been^ybllcly declared by us to be itself under a form of 'iriti^h protection.
