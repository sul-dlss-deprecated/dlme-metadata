There are two letters near the end of the file which are written by Mirza Mehedy Ally Khaun's successor, Jonathan Lovett.

All of the letters in this volume are stated as being true copies, signed by William Bruce, Assistant Resident, Bushire.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Resident, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Recovery</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ternate, sloop-of-war</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Resident, Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight John Malcolm</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000159.0x0003d9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
