V. 1The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited Awali Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, May 2E, 1941 C01J-Q16 His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear Sir, In the preemption clause, Paragraph 9, of the Political Agreement, His Majesty’s Government has, briefly in effect, the right to preempt all crude oil gotten under the Concession, to require the Company to refine oil fuel to Admiralty specifications, or to take over operations. Under certain possible international developments the Government might exercise their prerogative under these clauses. Naturally we would wish to cooperate if this step is taken and to expedite operations of such a plan. this move would necessitate some drastic changes in refinery operation, as well as disruptions in the delivery of products to various parts of the Empire. Therefore in the event that Government should make such an important decision, we should like to have a suitable period of notice in which to effect the change-over. In this connection will you inform us as to the procedure that would be followed, and what Government authority is competent to exercise the preemption clauses. Inasmuch as the local General Manager does not have the authority to consent to such matters on behalf of the Company, we should like to be assured that preemption would only come through formal written I political channels', so that he can submit the preemption orders Doubtless it is unnecessary to explain to you that r-v .1 to his directors THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LTDTHE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED w /v/, CON-817 Awali Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf. May 22, 1941 His Britannic Majesty’s Political Bahrein. Dear Sir, In another letter written to you today we have asked on whose authority we should act in fulfillment of the preemption clause. In this letter we should like to enquire by whose authority acting through what channels might the refining or producing installations be rendered less useful to the enemy. It appears possible that under some exigency of the moment a military officer might order that the Company’s property be damaged or destroyed. We should like to know whether the military would be the proper authority in such a case, or whether only a written order signed by the Political Agent and/or the Political Resident should be recognized.

The following is our position today:- 1. We received 250 drums of T.E.L. weighing 99 tons, 6| cwt. on March 20th shipped by Shell Company, Suez. The Bill of Lading dated 4th March states 'Consigned to Army stocks' 'Caltex, Bahrein (as agents for W.D.)'. On April 4th we received a second Bill of Lading dated March 29th for 250 drums T.E.L. weight 96 tons 0 cwt. indicating the Shell Company as shippers and Caltex, Bahrein, as consignee. Both Bills of Lading are signed by or for G.G.Jackson/ Maj. Gen. DST. This latter shipment is probably the one to which Mr. Bowlby refers in his letter. We have had no other advice on these shipments and therefore are unable to state from where the orders for shipment originated but have already written to Mr. Bowlby and to our New York Office in an effort to clarify the matter. The position of stocks of T.E.L. at Bahrein from the first of the year were given to Mr. Bowlby in our letter to of 12th April as follows:- Equiv. drums of CCS. 120,000 ccs.

We received advice from our New York Office on February 6th that they had placed an order for 3,299 drums which would approximate 1,267 tons but we have received no advice of shipping dates. We will appreciate your passing this information to Mr. Bowlby. CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM C CMP ANY LIMITEDOffice of the Petroleum Division Representative.

The T.E.L. Agreement can come into force on 1st April, 1943, and on this basis, assuming that quantities in excess of 520 drums were received during April, your telegram to London, despatched by the Political Agent, Bahrein, should read as followsi- Foreign Office Elfu No..... repeated Bagdad (Saving) From Petroleum Division Agent, Bahrein.

With regard to your (3), I have no knowledge of the arrange ments at home for placing orders for T.E.L.. but you will be in order in keeping your New York office au fait with your stock position, and your New York office should keep in touch with the Petroleum Division, London.
