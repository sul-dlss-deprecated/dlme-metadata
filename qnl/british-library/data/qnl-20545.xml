Holmes acts as ^e^otiator on behalf of the syndicate, but fails to secure concession from Shaikh.He undertakes in the meanwhile to bore 3 water wells for the Shaikh at cost of Hs.1,00,000. Failure to strike water prejudices Shaikh against company's liklinood ol linding oil. Holmes remains active and submits three revised drafts all of which are turned down by the Shaikh H.M.G. asks A.P.O.C. to try their hand but they refrain from doing so as they are of opinion that oil is not likely to be discovered in commercial quamtities.

The Shaiich has shown me a draft Agreement for an Oil # Concession, which Major Holmes has submitted to him, I gather that he has only been persuaded to consider it m 11 at all by the promise of a Lincoln motor car&gt; and I do not d think there is much lil^lihood of his granting the concession, as he told me that he considered the Eastern &amp; General Syn dicate a very 'weak' concern. He added that in any case he would have several other conditions of his own to lay down which they might well not accept. The failure of the water drilling operations,although they still say that they hope to get water any day, has un- doubtedly detracted from the prestige of the Syndicate in Kuwait, In fact a good many people in Kuwait think that they were never trying for sUjufrBftli water, but were secretly ti trying for oil instead, I of course do not know what the Shaikh thinks about this, but he certainly must have heard the suggestion. The actual draft Oil Concession is based on the Bahrain Oil Concession, but is very much more generous to the Shaikfc ^ j f tH l , I enclose herewith a note showing such differences as exist ff ^ V between it and the Bahrain Oil Concession. If the Shaikh should wish to grant the Concession, I . can see no grounds on which we should object - except in so far as the last clause of Article IX is concerned. This • clause reads that 'All imported native labour will be sub ject to and obey the Laws of the State of Kuwait',! presume this wasthis was Inserted as the result of previous negotiations, but, as Imported native labour would probably be largely Indian, it could not hold, and in any case is quite outside the sphere of a coaunercial Agreement. Political Agent, Kuwait*H s i NOTE on the OIL OONOESSION FOR KUWAIT, sugfeeeted by Major P. Holmes of the Eastern &amp; General Syndl' cate Limited in July 1928. This draft concession is the same as the Bahrain Oil Concession signed on the 2nd December 1925 (of which a copy was forwarded to this Political Agency under Residency en dorsement N0.78 -S dated the 3rd March 1926), with the fol lowing exceptions:- fij Article Y.

MEMORANDUM. / Reference my telegram No.34 dated the 7th February 1929 Major Holmes has apparently advised the Shaikh that it is useless to drill any deeper for water at the east of the town owing to the nature of the rock which has now been reached, and that it is in His Excellency's interests to abandon the well, as it has w reached the 7CC feet limit which the Syndicate undertook to dig, and the Shaikh will have to pay an additional Rs.5C/- a foot if he wish them to go any deeper. Major Holmes is most mysterious regarding the nature of the rock which they have reached, and told me that he would very much like to get Mr. Mayo (the head geologist of the A#P»0»C) to come and look at it, and that he had written to him about it* I asked him if he intended to renew negotiations with the Shaikh for an Oil Concession on his present visit,and hm replied that he had not yet decided definitely, but thought that he probably would not do so# He hinted that his decis ion depended on what the rock referred to above proved to be, He has now sent me his passport and asked for a visa for Bahrain, so presumably means to leave by the next 'down' steamer.

Kuwait Gil Concession &amp; Artesian Wells. 6 /f '1 Reference my memorandum N0.65 -S of 14th February 192^. Major Holmes left here by yesterday's mail steamer for Basrah en route for Baghdad, saying that he had been asked to 50 there again to discuss some water drilling project# It nas now been decided to abandon the well at the east of the town. As you are aware, by the original contract the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate undertook to sink two wells within the area surrounded by the town wall to a depth of seven hundred feet each, unless sweet water were obtained at a lesser depth, for Rs.100,000/*, of which Rs«40,000/» was to be paid in advance, Rs#30,000/- on completion of the first well, and Rs«30,000/- on completion of the second well. Of this the Shaikh has only paid the initial Rs.40000/ It appears that Major Holmes has now asked him for the Rs.30,000/- due on completion of the first well, but the Shaikh has demurred against paying, saying that the Syndi cate undertook to find water and have not done so. What Major Holmes or his unscrupulous coadjutor, Muhammad al- Yatfrn of Bahrain, may have told the Shaikh verbally I of course do not know, but there is naturally no such condition in the written Agreement. In it, moreover, it is laid down that in case of dispute, I am to arbitrate. In spite of this Major Holmes has apparently agreed, subject to the Syndi cate's concurrence, to waive this, and all other claims, against the Shaikh and to consider the Agreement cancelledo He has, moreover, offered to drill another well in another place ^ outside the town wall, as I understand from Major Holmes himself, though the Shaikh thinks it is to be inside) entirely9' entirely at the Syndicate 's expense, and to rely on the Shaikh's generosity in the event of finding good water. This certainly does not seem to be in accordance with the methods of ordinary business, and, from this and from what Major Holmes said about wanting to get Mr. Mayo*6 opinion about some rock, I think there can be no manner of doubt that he at any rate thinks he has found some formation which suggests the presence of oil, and that it is worth the Syndicate s while to drill at their own expense in another place in order to carry out further investigations. Major Holmes did not apparently mention the word 'oil' to the Shaikh during this visit. Political Agent, Kuwait.nr No. 88-S. To ♦Vf' CONFIDENTIAL.

''he curlouo feature is that, uespite the fact that under the agreemefnt this payment is not conditional on uucoess, and that any point in dispute is to be referred to the ''olitical A^ent for arbitration, Major Holmes has apparent ly not only agreed, subject to he flyndicate^ concurrence, to waive this ana all other claims against the fliaikh under the agreeiaent, but iias also offered to drill another vv^ll elaewhere entirely at the fvndicate's expense and to rely on the rhaikh'a generosity in the event of finding good water.

I-Iajor Holmes* draft agreement for an oil concession in Kuwait. Sir, I have the honour to forward one copy of the agreement for an oil concession which Major Holmes proposes to negotiate with H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait. The second copy furnished has been retained by me here. 2. Major Holmes apparently left Kuwait on 20th August and is reported to have flown from Baghdad to Paris. Before his departure he left instructions that the two copies above mentioned should be sent to me to Karachi but as I returned earlier than expected, they were given me here, 3. Although Major Holmes in his letter to me dated Basrah 20th August (sent you in original yesterday the 31st August 1930) stated that the agreement in general followed that made with Bahrain, I find several points of difference. Also I do not think British interests are sufficiently safeguarded, for instance,I think, we ought to get a clause inserted preventing his company in any way getting hold of the valuable 'Shuwaick' property with its deep water close inshore^and formerly leased to us as a prospective Naval base and coaling station, and which might quite easily again be required by the Navy or the Royal Air Force. For the same reasons I should like to see the Ras al-Ardh promontory including the village of Dimna denied to Holmes* Company, also other specified areas close to Kuwait that in the days to come might bebe required by troops as camping grounds or aerodromes etc. I would particularly draw your attention to paragraph 8 of the draft agreement which Major Holmes ap parently hopes will serve instead of the 'nationality' clause required to be inserted by the Colonial Office, vide Residency's confidential No. 290-3 dated 4th august, and which was duly communicated to the Shaikh by my predecessor on 16th November 1928 and to Major Holmes on 29th November 1928, and once again by me on 8th August of this year 1930. .&lt;ith regard to the clause in question, the Shaikh has intimated his profound gratitude that H .lvI .Govern- ment have thought good to advise him to insert it in any agreement come to wi th Llajor Holmes* Company. He recognized he said that H.LI.Government were merely trying to make things secure for him, and save him from getting mixed up with foreign concerns and individuals in future, which might ultimately bring in foreign interference. This attitude is satisfactory, I think, and ii the Jhaikh is to be believed, and I think he is sincere, he will himself insist on the introduction of what he calls the 'God sent clause', whatever the future may bring, and without any further pressure from E.M.Government. / Should you desire me to comment on the various clauses of the Draft Agreement, especially having in view H.M.Government 1 s interests, I am prepared to do so.

'* Sir, \ In reply to your telegram Ko*818 dated 9th Septemher, and in continuation of my confidential despatch $P Ho.294 dated 2nd September and paragraph 9, I have the i , \\ v »K OA&gt; • - vV &lt;A honour to forward in the form of an attached statement .certain corrections and additions which I think: with ad- h vantage be incorporated in Major Holmes* draft oil conces sion which he proposes negotiating with His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait, 2. I would also suggest that before any final agreement is signed, i-lajor Holmes* draft together with my suggestions be examined by a person possessing le^al know ledge with a view to insuring that none of its articles run contrary to the provisions of the Kuwait Order in Council of 1925. 5. I would also venture to suggest, if you see no objection to such course, that similar action be taken with Air Headquarters, Baghdad, with a view to safeguarding all possible present and future requirements of the Royal Air Force. 4. In particular, I would lay stress on para graph (5) above^as in my humble opinion the principality of Kuwait with its excellent climate and land-locked harbour, is bound to become a point of great strategic importance to the Empire as time goes on, and especially after 1932, when I ii ^ fo)'Iraq will obtain her independence. I even go so far as to assert that in Kuwait, we possess what is destined to become our leading Naval and Air Base in the Gulf. For it is evident that a force established at Kuwait will be able to dominate the Gulf, protect our Eastern air route (both that portion which passes down the Euphrates and also the portion down the Arabian shore), and last but not least, will give us a secure 'pied a terre' from which to threaten Basrah, the Euphrates valley and Kejd. 5. The Kuwait 'wedge' penetrating deeply as it does into, and dividing the boundaries of Nejd and ^raq where they meet near the Persian Gulf, will further give us^all important dominating advantage over Nejd and ^raq and put us in the position of being able to strike at the flank of either State should they ever be at war Y ;ith each other, and it is to our advantage to come to the assistance of one or the other. 6. To my mind the advantages of creating the future Gibraltar of the Gulf at Kuwait, are so obvious that I think a form of military occupation of the Prin cipality is not an improbability in course of time, which if tactfully arranged with the Ruler by means of suitable treaty, to include such things as generous subsidy, the guaranteeing of all his frontiers, the placing of any military force in cantonments well away from the town area, and complete assurance of non-interference in internal matters, will be welcomed rather than resented, provided always the matter is approached with tact and diplomacy. 7 • This brings me to paragraph 1 of Major Holmes 1 agreement and the safeguarding clauses which I think should be inserted. The Shuwaikh area and coaling station as recently leased by us from the Huler, and given up when we occupied T Iraq and thought we were going to stay there, is of great value because it possesses a good deep water ai^d anchorage, a few hundred feet from the mainland,which anchorage is cccipletely protected from the strongest 'shamals 11 or North West wind by the island of Grain, T/ith this area safeguarded for the future ^se of the Royal Navy and Royal Air ]?orce, we retain the principal asset for a future Air and Naval Base in our hands from the fltart and deny it to any oil or other coup any that may come along, ^imilagly, if not secured beforehand, it will be the first spot to be seized upon by a commercial concern# Similarly the on^y suitable site for future cantonments having regard to the intense summer heat of Kuwait, is the laud lying along the Northern shore of the Ras al^rArdh peninsula, starting from al-Shaab to the Ras al-Ardh point* In this area the summer temperature is always 7^ to 10° cooler than anywhere further inland, be cause both North Western and South Eastern winds which prevail blow across water. It is necessary therefore in my opinion to deny this area and to a depth of 1 mile, to Major Holmes* company who will be the first to build barracks etc. etc. for their staff on the site. similar reasons, I have also included the aerodrome, and camping grounds of al-Dasmah and al- x,igara, 1 and 2 miles respectively South East of Kuwait and on the road to the reserved area mentioned in (8). I do not propose to discuss other proposed additions and alterations in the agreement of Major Holmes suggested in the attached statement, as each bears an • obviously important meaning, and speaks for itself. Para graph 8 and subheads (a) and (b) must of course come out and the 'British nationality' clause as laid down by the Colonial Gj.^ice must replace it. i. 1 his to me is an obvious and ne cessary precaution and one which the Shaikh himself desires. Lastly if Major Holmes* company agrees to the 'British nationality' clause being inserted in the Agreement, the next step will be to decide on the best way of getting-4- | the other various clauses suggested by me / put in, always of course provided they are approved. In my opinion and especially as the Shaikh has not as yet seen the proposed agreement, it would be simplest and quickest if His Llajesty^a Government were to instruct Llajor Holmes to make the correct ions required, before he returns to the charge, and opens discussions with the Shaikh. This can be done either in London or by letter from you to me. The other way, but not so good, is to Y^ait for Llajor Holmes to start negotiations and then when the Shaikh asks our advice, to require him to get Lajor Holmes to insert our clauses, I have the honour to be.

Mo* 42 of 1950 My Lord # In continuation of ay despatch 40• 38 # dated 17th September 1930, I have the honour to sutetit for the consideration of His Majesty's uoTerraaent souc further coaments regarding ihe draft concession which the Eastern and ueneral Syndicate desire tu negotiate with the nhaikh of Auwait. 2. Ihe first point which X think should be decided is whether the eastern and General syndicate are prepared to accept the insertion of the nationality cXause. ftroBi the terms of the draft concession it is evident that they do not propose to work the concession theaselTes but to transfer it to another coapany. and there can be but little duubt that this will be the Bahrain Petroleun Coapany or another subsidiary coapany of the Standard uil Company of California formed for the express purpose of working this concession. Ihe rhaiick of Kuwait has informed Colonel Dickson definitely that he is not prepared to grant the concession to Aaerican in terests. 1 personally consider it aost undesirable that he/ The Might Honourable Lord ass field, His Majesty's Secretary of state for the Colonies, Colonial office, ijOHDOB.- 3 - • ■ /v^ he should do 00: although they have obtained a con- ce«8ion In Bahrain, it vould oeera deaxrablo, if poss* ible, to excluda then from otier ^lacea in the Persian Gulf. If the nationality clause is inoisted upon, it seens nut improbable that the isartern and General Syndicate will abandon the attempt to obtain a concession and then these will be no need to consider the maLter further. lihouid they however desire to obtain a con cession and be willing to accept the nationality clause then 1 submit for consideration the ^ollowin(; points which have been brought to my notice by Colonel Dickson. 3. The first point the rolitxcal A ^ent lias raised is the question of what ars known as the Bandar ahuwaik lands. In my despatch jio. 20 oC ti e 50th April 1^30 (copy to Uovernment of India unuer endorsement Ho* r 196-u of same date;, I expreseed the view that on strategic grounds it was desirable to maintain the in dependence of Kuwait and I understand that thiv view is shared by the Air liinistry and possibly also by the Admiralty. As His Majesty's uovemment ars aware, the Shuwaik area was fonxrly leased by us from the ^ler and given up in 1922. It is of great value because it possesses a good deep water anchorage a few hundred fest from the mainland completely protected from the iorth-wtst wind by the island of arain. Colonel uxckson consiuers that should it at any time be considered desirable to establish an air or naval base in Kuwait this vould be the place for it and that unless steps were taken to prevent its occupation, this ttoulct be the first piace to be seised upon by any commercial concern desirous of establishing a harbour in iuiYvait. similarly, in the itolitical Agent's opinion the only suitable site for future cantonments, having regard to t e intense sumner' 3 ' heat of Kuwait, 1 b the land lying along the northern shore of the las-al ^Ardh peninoula. starting from Al-t &gt;haab to the Hae»al«Ardh point. In this area the suuraer temperature 1 b always 7 to 10 degrees cooler than anywhere further inland because both the Morth«vest and ;jouth-eaet winds whioh preTail %lo« across water. he coneiaers therefore that it is desirable to exclude this area to a depth of one aile fron the shore from the tenas of the concession and also the aero drome and encamping grounds of Al-i^aama and jll~ttlgara 9 one and two mileB res .ectiveiy aouih-eattt of Kuwait and on the road to the reserved area mentioned abore. 1 agree genera lly with these views and consider it eseential that any areas which way subsequently be required for ifiilitary a naval or air force purposes should be excluded from the concession. I attach herewith a note giving the amendments which Colonel Dickson considers should be made to the existing agreement to give effect to the above proposal. 4. Xt *111 be seen that the powers sought by the company are exceedingly ilMH0 extensive. In Article 9(b) they seelc power to establish telegraph lines. This 1 do not think should be granted te them. should the oom^ny at any time desire to establish telegraph conmunication between any of their offices or works it would doubtless be possible to arrange with the administration then running the Kuwait yele graphs to construct a telegraph line for them at their cost. jT Paragraph t(s) authorises them to use any water * within the territory of the Hhaikh and with the assistance of the 3haikh to make water courBes t etc. This seems to me to be very vaguely worded. She term # any water within the territpyy of the shaikh** la exceedingly wide and ml^ht enable the coEipaa^ to take over wells in Kuwait territory for their own exeluelve use which are reiiulred by ihe Kuwait tribes* in, i do not umerut ntt tit. BeiuiiBg of/t\v -4- ojf tht nord® the assistance oi the ahaiJch'. Doee this impose any liability on him or not ? / 4 Again, rurther on, the company acquire all surface rights, easements and priviliges over Kuwait territory which it may find netessary for any of the purposes of the concession; though Tillage areas are sub- •equently excluded. I am not aware or the exact meaning of the above words v but they seem to confer exceedingly extensive rights which, I think, should be more clearly defined. y. In paragra^J^the company seek the right to l^r down buoys and erect lighthouses* This I consider should not be granted to them. it is desirable xo have a unilorm system of lights and buoys throughout the uulf, and I con* ) sider that,the power ol putting down buoys and erecting lighthouses, etc., should remain in the hands of one authority, and that the company should have no rights xn this respect. should they consider the lights and buoys inadequate for their purposes it seems improbable that they would experience any difficulty in obtaining from the Conservancy Board or other authority responsible for the lighting and buoying of the (rulf additional buoys or lights provided they were prepared to pay the bill. fr. In Article 4 the company seek the right to establish coal and oil stations along the coast. Ihers would seem to be serious objections to this if the company is to be an American one but possibly not the same objec tions if it is to remain British. ^ In Article &amp; the shaikh is accorded the right ts keep a general eye over the doings of the company. Shis seems to me a somewhat meaningless phrase capable of almost any interpretation that one may care to put on it. I'hs right 4/-6- Sa rights of the Shaikh In this respect should, 1 think, be much more closely defined. /0 t W ot the reasons stated above Articles B(a) and (b) should* I consider, be replaced by the nationality clause. It will be seen that Major Holmes proposes to be Chief Local Representative at Kuwait as well as at i^ahrain. I do not see how this is possible. The intention of appointing Major Holmes chief local representative at Bahrain was to have someone more or lees permaaently on the spot with ihom any questions that arose could at once be diocuteed. it would seem impoasible for Major iiolmes to fulfil this function in two separate places. In this connection I may mention that I gained the impression when talking to Major Holmes that it was by no means his intention to resxae permaneiitly at Bahrain and this impression has been strengthened by the present concession. I would venture to suggest therefore that an enquiry should be made from the Astern and General s. ndicate as to Major Holmes* intentions in this respect and that some arrangement should be come to under which he should reside for some stipulated period, say, nine months in each year 9 at Bahrain. I am sending a copy of this despatch and of its % enclosure, to the Foreign secretary to the uovermient of India. I have i.he honour to be, My juord. Your ijordship's most obedient, humble servant.

I have the honour to inform you that Mr .Adams, Secretary of the Eastern and General Syndicate, in his letter dated the 19th August 1930 to the Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, -yftpa. makes a quite inaccurate statement in the first paragraph of his letter. Major Holmes never discussed the draft treaty in any way with me, nor did I see same until after he had left for Basrah, when he instructed his clerk to send me two copies.

His Kxcellency Shaikh Sir /hmad discussed the matter with me during recent visit to Kuwait. He began by saying that Major Holmes had not shown him the draft agreement and that he did not know what terms he proposed to offer. His .excellency however was extremely emphatic regarding what is known as the nationality clause and said that under no conditions whatsoever would he grant a concession to any concern that was not entirely and al together British. 3* He stated that while he had no more dislike to increasing his income than anybody else, money could toe too dearly purchased, and he was not prepared to ototain wealth at the sacrifice of his personal dignity. If the concern was entirely British and difficulties arose with it or with its employes he could always seek redress from his Political Agent, but he would certainly not allow a lot of foreigners . •.

Dear Sir, APPLICATIQIT FOR lOTAlT OIL QOITQaaSIOIT. Ifith reference to the letter received by you from the Colonial Office, dated the 4th instant, the following was the position of the proposed Kuwait Oil Concession when I left Kuwait on the 20th August 1930 ■I had informed the Political Agent Kuwait that I intended negotiating an oil concession covering Kuwait Territory with H.JS. Sir Ahmed 'bin Jabar Al Subar, Ruler of Kuwait. The Political Agent told me that there was no objection to my doing so, but that he would have to inform Sir Ahmed, acting under instructions from the Hon. fee Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that in any concession agreement dealing with oil, the British Nationality Clauses would have to be inserted. The Sheik informed me that he was willing to discuss immediately a concession, but beyond referring briefly to the suggested terms of the concession to the Sheikh's Secretary of State, I did not go into details with the Sheikh, as I wished first to consult my Directors as to whether it would not be preferable to ask the Colonial Office to accept, in place of the British Nationality Clauses, the clauses that were agreed in the case of the Bahrein Oil Concession. I informed the Political Agent that it was my intention to return to London to confer with the Directors and at the same time told him that 1 would have two copies ofof the proposed draft concession agreement inade, one copy for the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and one copy for the Political Agent Kuwait. The two copies were handed to the Political Agent Kuwait on the 29th August 1930, with a request that one copy he sent to the Political Resident Bushire. This I did so that the Political Resident and the Political Agent Kuwait could forward their views on the subject to the Colonial Office and so save time in the forthcoming negotia tions with them here. Yours faithfully. Sd/- Prank Holmes.

A further complication, which did not arise in the case of the Bfihrein oil oonceRFlcci, is that the concession as drafted would cover the hinterland of Koweit, The international difficulties which might arise from an attack on, or the murder of, foreign prospectors by tribesmen need no errphasis, 4. The liecretary of iitate dees not overlook the fact that the iastern and Oeneral syndicate, if it is decided to insist on the proposed nationality restrictioti, will not improbably represent to the 'ulf company Ui^t thiB restriction is one which was suggested in the first place ^b' 1 to the aheikh by His Jajesty'c oovemment (see paragraph 1 of njor iiolmejeixletter of 16th i eptember, copy enclosed in Colonial Office letter of 4th October, No.79198/30), and that in any case the ;.heikh would probably respond to pretisure from His Majesty's Govemment, and would be prepared to agree to provision 1 or the •ssigiiment of the concession if he could be sure that is la^sty's Oovemnent saw no objection. In these circumEtftnceBt the possibility that precsure may be brought to bear through the diplomatic channel to facilitate a settlement on the lines accepted in the case of Bahrein cannot be overlooked, and it is desirable to consider the general position of His Majesty's Govemnent as regards the 'open door' in the matter of oil concessions, 5. u the United atates Government His I ajesty's Govemnent are uncommitted on the principle of exclusion in territories such as Koweit. The reply given to a reauest by the United Gtates Government for a statement of oili / Ac- / oil policy in Bimilar territories in May 1929 was that 'Hie Majesty 's Government feel bound to reserve to themselves th» right to consider on its merits and in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time, each proposal for the holding or operation of petroleum concessions by foreigners in such territories, and that they find themselves unable to make any such general statement of their policy' (Foreign Office letter to United States Smbassy of 29th May, 1929). The general ^ v question of the policy to be adopted ininegard to the grant of oil conceBFione in British territory has recently been reviewed by His Majesty 's Govemrnent in the United Kingdom, who have decided subject to various reservations, to approve in principle the policy of the open door in oil matters in territories under their administration: but it is clearly necessary to consider oil policy in any of the Gulf states • the position of which is qui^e peculiar as a separate matter from that adopted in British territory; altogether different considerations are involved, and the general decision in regard to British territory is of course not applicable in cases such as that of Bahrein and Koweit. 6. The Secretary of State is strongly of opinion, in the circumstances referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, that there is no reason why any pressure should be brought to bear on the Sheikh of Koweit to modify his attitude in the present case. No valid argument can, in his view, be based on the attitude adopted by His i^ajesty's Government in the matter of the Bahrein oil concession. In Bahrein the position was already compromised by the fact that a concession had actually been granted to and taken up by the Sastern and General Syndicate, and that it contained o nationality bar. In the case of Koweit not only has no Ano concepeion bean nerotlated, but tfie ^hellcb 1 b unwilling to 'rant one save to a bona-ride British Corrpanj', or to agree to a eubsequent tranefer to American Interests, If the Eastern and General ::yndlcate have led the Gulf Oil Company to believe that their negotiations with the shellch of Kowelt had advanced further and hsd a greater prospect of success than was altogether Justified by the facte/ . His ajesty's Covennent cannot be expected to take responsibility for the etatements made by the iyndlcate: nor Is there any reason why, In fact of the strong objections to the admittance of a foreign Interest In the present Instance, they should allow their hands to be forced a second time. 7. fir. Bonn would therefore strongly urge that the eastern and General Syndicate should be Informed that the bheUch sf Kowelt Is not prepared to grant an oil concession, save to a bona fide British co.ipany, or to agree to its transfer In any circumstances to a concessionaire of other than British nationality. The correspondence which has passed with the eastern and General syndicate in connection with the oil concession in Bahrein suggests that Its financial position is weak, and that it Is perhaps unlikely to proceed with its negotiations for a coacession in Koweit If it has reason to believe that provision for transfer will not be accepted by the sheikh. ahould, however, the *yndicate In fact prove willing to accept the proposed nationality bar in the concession, it will be necessary to consider In greater detail the terras of the concession itself. fhe Secretary of State is in general agreement with the criticismscrltlciras of that concesBion on points of detail advftnced by the Politleol Heeident and the Political Agont, i 'oweit., and Mt out In Colonel b I bcoo'h deoratcii to the secretary for the Colonies, So,42, Anted tith October/ 1930.

'N I have recently been prowling round the state y and trying to find out what has made Holmes so keen on getting an oil concession from the Sheikh of Kuwait. 2, As I think the results of my investigations will interest you I give them below. 3, Also they will be useful for you as weapons should you meet Holmes in Baghdad, where I hear he is at the present moment• 4, Briefly, and as already mentioned in my Intelligence Report No.333 Dated 27th December, I found &amp; most inter esting eprir:^ of pure Pitu - ,n or tar, oozing out of the ground in the crater like depression formed by the 'Burgan ' hills Ac miles south of Kuwait. Though the arra is now heaviljr covered with a deposit of sand, I believe if properly examined the whole place would divulge a series of Bitumen springs which I presume is a bi-product of oil. The stuff was oozing out in a soft glutinuous state, and I brought back samples. Actually these springs have been reported in Knox's time I believe, but the report may have quite easily been (f] overlooked. Holmes certainly visited Burgan Hills and examined the springs. ' // 5 # At War a, the ciirious sugar loaf shaped 1 ill, 1C niler r crtl of Burgan, I found a piece of stone covered with Bitumen deposit. I brought back a sample. No deposit of this mineral has ever teen reported as far as I know to exist at this place. Holmes also visited 'Wara 7 ' Hill and examined it. 6,On the 9th I visited and examined the area due north of Kuwait Town on the opposite side of the bay. Tear 'l/ughatti' where the whole country side is a mass of red sandstone, I found in the low lying salty depression known as the The Honble. Lt.Gol. K .V.Blscoe a/0 H.E. The High Commissioner for Iraq, Baghdad.\1^ the ' Bahra' , two obviously fair!7 recen'.l r excavated holes in the ground out of which crude oil was slowly oozing and trying to mix with the salty puddles that lay about after the recent rains. It was quite obvious what the stuff was from its strong smell. My bedouin escort told me that in Hamiltons time a Euro pean had paid the place a visit from Basra, but to his disappointment had almost immediately been recalled. They said Holmes did not see the place, butI happen to know that in Holmes' absence in England his mining Engineer Armstrong did do so on the quiet. My informant also tells me that he reported very favourably on what he found to London, It is significant that the so called ''water bore' which Armstrong put down near the Sheiks Palace, and which went down 700 feet and more, lay exactly on the straight line drawn between the oil spring mentioned in (6) above and the 'Burgan' hill to the south; Also samples of some kind of black deposit of the consistency of putty, and strongly impregnated with crude oil were brought up to the surface, I got this from a person who saw it, and I know the sample Y\ T as never shown to the Sheikh, According to Armstrong who openly told me this in private conversation, there are traces of oil also in the form of surface ooze 5 miles east of Jahara on the sea shore(south side of Bay) • These I have not yet visited, Armstrong also gave a friend of mine to understand that he thought the oil bearing Zone moved in a S.Westerly direction from A.P.O.C's main fields at Maidan Naphtun, and that the most likely place to find it in Kuwait territory was towards the South West, All the above facts I give for what they are worth, as you may think it worth while passing my letter on to the A.P.C.G or to H,M ,Gr. It is quite p»tent to me that there are strong 'surface' oil indications in Kuwait, but whether the 'strata' lies the right way is another matter: Holmes ^uite obviously thinks it does, or he would not be so anxious to get his agreement through.

It is observed from Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe's 4 despatch No .43 of the 20th October, that Major Holmes f 7/3 '' has stated that his principals, the American Gulf Company, would certainly object to the inclusion in the Concession of a clause stipulating that the Concession shall only be worked by British interests.

Lord Passfield fools considerable hesita tion in adopting this si^. .estion. In the first place he finds it difficult to believe that in the event of representations bein, , received fro ithe Irovem ent of the United utates of ^ erica, a reply from ; is ajesty's Gotem mt b.ised on categorical information 1 S :c i -JT -M Ci ^ A F0H3I&amp;i&lt; OmCJC. ^ u -f\'inlormation received from their representative in the Persian Gulf would not be accepted, at any rate so far as the fact® of the case were concerned. In this connection attention is invited to despatch ^ Ko. 40 T of t e 9th of i ovemuer fro i the liesident in the Persian rulf, (a copy of rhich was sent to the Forei^i Office under cover of Colonial Office letter of the 8th of December) from which it will be observed that at an interview with Colonel Biscoe the Shaikh of Kuwait expressed in forcible terms his refusal to grunt a concession to any concern that was not entirely Briti h. 5. In the second place the Secretary of iState is disposed to doubt the wisdom of taking any step at this sta&amp;e which might unduly embarrass the Shaikh in ohe future, should he desire to recede from the attitude which lie hat now seen fit to adopt. In the present instance it nas been agreed that His ajesty^ Grovem »ent need make no effort to persuade the Shaikh to grant a Concession to the Eastern and general Syndicate, who have made no secret of their intention to&lt;56 to transfer it to forei. 71 interests at tiie first opportunity. On the other hand, if in the future some non-British concern of adequate standing should apply to the Shaikh for the grant of a concession with the definite intention of d «veloping the oil resources of his territory, His Majesty's U-ovemment might welcome a change In the Shaikh's attitude. Such a change would not be made easier by the existence of a document of the nature pro osed in your letter, 4. In all the circumstances, therefore, Lord Passfield trusts that after reconsideration of the matter I'r. Bendersonwill a^ree with his view that matters should be allowed to remain as they aro.

They endeavoured in 1921 to obtain a concession but without success, and the present condition of the oil market and the discovery of further large resources of oil in Irak have not tended to strengthen the case for expending any more capital on oil exploration in Koweit.

Dear Colonel Biscoe, Please refer to our despatch 6^ Confidential M A ,, of the 6th of February, and previous correspondence about the application of the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, for an oil concession in Kuwait. I think you should know that, with a view to ascertaining whether there are any prospects of British interests being willing to undertake exploration for oil in the Kuwait area. Sir John Cadman has been asked ; tnrough trie Mines Department here, whether either the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or the Iraq Petroleum Company would be prepared to consider the matter. A reply has now been received from him to the effect that the available geological information does not encourage the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to take any further steps in the matter. ^MNT COLONEL H, V. BISCOE. Thehe Com any point out that they endeavoured in 1921 to obtain a concession without success. and the present condition of the oil market and the discovery of further large resources of oil in Iraq, nave not tended to strengthen their case for expending any more capital on oil exploration in Kuwait. Moreover the country of Kuwait appears to be entirely covered with alluvium and rocks of recent geological age, which would involve drilling of a very speculative type. I snould add that, before replying definitely on the point Sir John Cadraan expressed a wiSii to know the character of the terms which the Eastern and General Syndicate were prepared to offer in Kuwait, and also the terms on which the concession in Bahrein was actually concluded. No objection was felt to supplying Sir John with a copy of the Bahrein Concession, wnicn is a fait accompli, and this was done, me case of Kuwait, however, was, of course.different. As the Syndicate's application was at tmt time still under coiisideration. Sir John Cadman and the groups which hehe represents had to be regarded as commercial competitors, and It was thought Inadvisable to disclose to one competitor the terms which had been offered by another. He was, therefore told no more than that the proposed Kuwait Concession was on generally similar lines to the concession already granted in Bahrein, with variations as to payment. I did not want to put this into a despatch and hence rave resorted to a semi-official letter. Yours sincerely, vAf. n jt h.confidential. K No. F .282 -N/28.

I for Juu, h*. lint/So Palestine and Cyprus, I think it my duty to write and tell /U . /o S~S &amp; 3A you that the activities of Major Holmes in Kuwait rather fill me with concern, and I do not feel exactly happy at the thought that he will rem in in Kuwait after my de parture, and will probably start a fresh 'attack' on the Shaikh, over his precious oil concession. 3. Holmes is, I am convinced, not playing straight by this Agaicy and is trying to short circuit to the st cf 'lis pcver and generally keep us in the dark as to his activities. His various moves on his present visit are given below. 4. He arrived in Kuwait on 16th April i931, with a flourish of trumpets, informing the Shaikh by wire from different places on route that he was coming. His passport was endorsed in Baghdad for as many journejT-s as he chose to make to Kuwait during the year. 5. On final arrival at Kuwait he called on me and told me IttE he had only come to close down his so called water boring plant and pay the Shaikh compensation of Rs 10,000/- for not finding water. In reality the plant is I i! To The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel H.V.Biscoe, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e. •y-2' .^O) is an oil ^or ing raa chine of the usual type and I have every reason to believe he never contempfeted from the first trying to find water but merely was putting down a trial 'oil' bore. I have also good reason to believe that results have been highly satisfactory from his point of view. 6. Cn the 1st May the Shaikh told me that Holmes had given him 'notes' for Rs 10,000/- and had asked permission to remove the 'water' boring plant, which was to be sent to Bahrain. The Shaikh highiy praised Eolmes 'generosity' which he said was most unexpected. 7. The machinery was then dismantled, but under the excuse that existing pipes could not be withdrawn, only 10 tubes out of a pipe depth of 750 feet (approx.) were removed. The rest have been left in situ, and the whole thing has been covered over with earth. The boring machine now awaits shipment to Bahrain. 8. On the 7th May the Shaikh informed me con fidentially that Eolmes had called and given him two draft •§. oil agreemoits for consideration, but that he the Shaikh li had had no time to see them, 9. Thinking that Holmes would come round and discuss matters vath me or at least send me a copy of the agreemait, I waited patiently till the 15th May without results. I then visited the Shaikh and asked if he could let me see the copies sent to him. This was readily done and they were sent round to me. The Shaikh at this interview assured me 'that holmes had in no way discussed the drafts with him, nor mentioned anything at all about the 'British Nationality Clause' which both he (the Shaikh) and we had required to be included. 10. At this and a subsequent interview the Shaikh made it quite clear to me that he would look at no agreement unless it contained the 'British Nationality Clause', in accordance wi 1ii his wish expressed to you and me.-3- 11. Having read both Holmes draft agreements sent me by the Shaikh, I found that the first was exactly a facsimile of the one he had put in to the Shaikh last yax year, and which he had been told was not acceptable. The second was an entirely new one. attached) and asked him to send me a copy of the draft which I understood he had given to the Shaikh and on the same day he forwarded me a copy of the second and new agreement only. He followed up his covering note by call ing and apologizing for not having sent it before, and talked Irery big about what the Colonial Office had said to him, and he to the Colonial Office. I for my part adopted a guarded attitude and refused to be drawn. 13. After his departure I examined the new agreement, and found that it contained no clause what soever that complied with the 'Nationality Clause' we stood out for, instead clause 8 had been inserted which as you will see for yourself in no way meets the case, and to my mind is even more objectionable than that in serted in the 1920 draft agreement. I also found certain differences between the Arabic and English texts raiaich I have marked. 14. I rather suspect that Holmes hopes to push his present draft through by judicious palm-oiling of certain high dignataries here after I am gone, I do not of course believe the Shaikh will succumb to such an attack - I have far too much confidence on his sense. 15. I enclose with this the copy of the draft agreement in question, with a request that should you desire to give me any special instructions in the matter, these might be sent me by telegram. 16. I shall of course explain to Greenway before I go how the local 'oil' situation stands, but beyond this and advising him to be on his guard I do not myself counsel any particular action at presento 12.
