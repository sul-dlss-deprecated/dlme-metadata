She describes a small student body (such that the bawaab at AUC’s gate recognized every student), and how campus social life operated with women students making up a small proportion of the total. She recalls positive aspects of the American style of education, such as the system of academic advising and counseling, visiting professors from universities in America, and faculty who expected students to ask questions and who interacted with them outside of class. She spent her junior year as a study abroad exchange student in California, and completed AUC’s required senior thesis and oral examination. The role of extracurricular activities, including sports like basketball, as well as the criteria for the Miss AUC competition, which she won in 1949.
