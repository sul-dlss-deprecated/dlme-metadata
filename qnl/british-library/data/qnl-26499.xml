The Shaikh of Kuwait and ? leading members of the Al Subah sent telegraphic messages of condolence to H.M. the King at Kiath, as well as letters. Ibn Jiluwi was of the House of Al Saud, his grandfather being younger brother of the great Faisal, grandfather of the present King. He was one of the famous forlorn hope of 20 who taking their lives in their hand entered Hiath with their Chief Abdul Aziz and by a remarkable coup de main seized the Town f rom tha Rachid forces, after slaying their leader, f Ajlan, as he fled for refuge to the Kut or fort. It was actually Bin Jiluwi 1 s sv/ord which struck down Ajlan after Abaul Aziz*s spear which he nurled at the fleeing ‘Ajlan had missed its mark. Ibn Jiluwi was famed throughout Saudi Arabia for his courage and loyalty to his madier, also for his remarkable aptitude for instilling fear into the Badawin, and incidentally for the heaviness of his hand. Many stories are extant of his Solomon like justice, and for the fact that he never had the slightest mercy on an evildoer. Through the death of Ibn Jiluwi, Bin Saud has lost a great administrator and faithful supporter, while the Bedawin world, notably the Ajman are to-day rejoicing and thanking God for removing a man they considered their greatest enemy.

Mr. Hope Gill to Sir John Simon.—(Received October 4.) (No. 384.) Sir, Jedda, September 8 , 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that Hajji Abdullah Ali Riza, the octogenarian Governor of Jedda, died at Taif on the 24th August after an illness of about two months. 2 . His death caused some emotion in Hejazi circles, for he was a well-known and popular figure, and had enjoyed, at various times, considerabie influence in the country. He had been Kaimakam (Governor) of Jedda since the early days of King Hussein’s regime, and was confirmed in the post by Ibn Saud, when the latter entered Jedda at the end of 1925. 3. Of Persian origin, he came to the Hejaz as a young man and with his brothers built up an important trade with India and the Persian Gulf. He died a wealthy, wise and witty old man, hard of hearing but very bright of eye, a personality head and shoulders above the sorry, stunted humanity of the Hejaz. His relations with successive British representatives were uniformly good. 4. The late Governor was the last holder of the old Turkish title of Kaimakam. The foreign representatives were informed on the 30th August by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that a Royal decree had been issued for the title of Governor of Jedda to be changed to that of Amir, thus bringing Jedda into line with all the other towns of importance in the kingdom. Hajji Abdullah’s successor is a Nejdi named Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, who was previously Amir of Yanbu. He is a young man of good Nejdi stock, his grandfather being, 1 believe, Governor of Riyadh in the days of the Rashidi rule. 5 . The change in title has no great significance. The change in the person of Governor, however, may well prove to have a far-reaching effect. The appoint ment of a Nejdi to a post held for so long by one who, in spite of his Persian origin, had succeeded in identifying himself with the Hejaz and its interests has caused misgiving in Jedda. For one thing, it accentuates the Nejdi domination of the Hejaz. For another, the new Amir, though well spoken of in certain circles, is an official pure and simple, and it is to be expected that he will be much more amenable to the influence of Mecca and Riyadh than was Hajji Abdullah, who was known frequently to have opposed the central authority in the interests of Jedda and the Hejaz generally and to have been extremely outspoken on occasions with Ibn Saud himself. 6 . The new Amir is nevertheless welcomed by the European shipping agencies in Jedda, for he has no personal interest in shipping and is unlikely therefore to use his official position to further private interests as a shipping agent, to the detriment of rival firms, as was the frequent practice of the late and sagacious Hajji Abdullah. ' 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Senior Naval Officer in Red Sea sloops and the Acting Commissioner at Port Sudan. I have. &lt;&amp;:c. C. G. HOPE GILL.(E 2484/282/25) 1 &gt; 7 . 31 58 JEDDA, No. 148. 17th April, 1931. Sir With reference to my telegram No. 19 of February 2, I have the honour to state that Fuad Bey Hamza returned to Jedda on April 13 and informed me by a personal letter of April 15 that he had resumed his duties i.e. those of Under secretary for Foreign Affairs. 2. Although Fuad Bey’s illness in December and January was undoubtedly genuine, many people thought him unlikely to return to the Hejaz. Now that he has come back, it remains to be seen what balance will be established between him and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, whose position with the King is strong and who has since the beginning of February been thrust into close contact with the foreign representatives. It will also be interesting to see how much of his time Fuad Bey will spend in Jedda, either as a visiting representative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or as head of a properly organized local branch of the Ministry. 3. It has been evident during the last two or three months that the Amir Faisal himself plays no effective role as Minister for Foreign Affairs. He does not appear to have had anything to do with the recent negotiations with Iraq except when texts had to be signed. I doubt whether he has even followed the correspondence about Trans-Jordan. On one occasion when I suggested to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that certain gpitish protected persons on whose behalf I had made oral representations to him had been rebuked by the Hejazi Government for appealing to the Legation, he said that there could/ His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.could be no connection because only he, the King, my inter preter and myself had had knowledge of our conversation. It did not occur to the Sheikh to include in his list the Minister whose acting Under Secretary he theoretically was at the time. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioners for Iraq and Trans-Jordan, The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department.

I accepted this in deference to tlie hair’s royal standing and for reasons of practical policy and visited hin by arrangeiftent on tile morning of the 29th. This visit was formal and in the course of it we arranged that I shou ld again see him to talk business at 5.30 on January 30, an hour fixed by the prince after I had expressed readiness, as it was Bsmadhaa, to call on him at any hour of the day or night except my din; er hour, biieikh Yusuf Yasin was present at the formal visit and it was clear that he was taking on Fuad bey's work. 5. hen I arrived at the Palace at the hour fixed on January 30 , there was no one in attendance and no sign that I was expected. X made .ay way to the upper floor and finding the door of the ante?-hicsuber to the reception room open, I went in there while ray interpreter nude enquiries.

I added that I had already written to the ■lair and that I could not consider a visit by two subordinates as ade-iuate satisfaction but would gladly listen to tliesu.

I said that as the Prince was ill, I should accept a visit froa Yusuf Yasin, if he caiae to convey a suitable apology in the course of the evening. Otherwise I si jo old send the King next day a copy of ray letter to the Prince. 7. jm hour later, Yusuf Yasin announced a visit, he tendered an apology which left nothing to be desired# We had a raost friendly conversation, in the course of which X said that I was fully satisfied and regarded the incident as closed# It was clear froru the various convert tlons that it was due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances, tlue Prince and presumably Ills servants having been overcome by Raraadhan ruid Yusuf Yusin having been delayed owing to Puad 3ey*s departure.British legation, JWDA, January 30th, 1931# Your Royal Highness, After Coaapliaents, I cannot hut express to Your Royal Highness lay extreme murprl&amp;e at the manner in which I was treated this afternoon when I went to the Green Palace at the hour which you had fixed to receive me for the discussion of important business# I learnt with regret that Your Royal Highness had been overtaken by a sudden illness but the information given to me by an officer of your household who appeared after I had waited a short time did not suffice to explain (a) why no official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was deputed to receive me, or (b) why, if no such official was available I was not warned by telephone that I could not be received* I shall be grateful if Your Royal Highness will bring this imxixtmnt to the noties of His Majesty the King in order that S TCeive suitable satisfaction for the treatment tWo ccccowUiL (a the representative of His Majesty King With highest respect.

ISO? IT My dear Laithwaite, You will, I thinlc, he interested to see the enclosed copy of a semi-official letter from Ryan about Fuad Hamza. I am asking Lloyd to try to get us con firmation of the story referred to in the second paragraph. Yours ever, ^ * ^7, J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office. /I am anxious to improve our supply of iniormatian on 'xersonalitlee”. What we have is fairly good but very incomplete. for instance Ihilby told me that before he came to this country Fuad Hamaa had been employed in a subordinate post in Palestine; that he had involved himself in a highly revolutionary plot against our administration; and that he skipped over the border to .Egypt only .lust before the police came down on the store of arras etc, accumulated by the plotters* Can you confirm this yarn? If true, it is of the highest interest to a person like myself who has to talk to Fuad about 'Political offendere'* h propos of extradition arrangements with Iraq* I might perhaps have put this question to Jerusalem but I have no personal attaches there of a suitable xind* As for ruad, he grows on me. I still don't trust him rauoh t but he is pleasant and on his best behaviour with me. A Minister for Foreign Afiairs who can think and express himself precisely, and talk English to boot, is not to be sneezed at. But 1 want to know all there is to know about him/ G.R*Warner Esq. C.M.G.*0 £1 him. I do not think his present position with Ibn Saud is strong but he is probably considered necessary. Another of Philby’.e yarns is tltfit he has twice tendered hie resignation during the last month but allowed himself each time to be persuaded to stay in office. The story that the mir Ifelaal is to be Minister for foreign Affairs with fuad as assistant is still going the rounds but lacks confirmation.

WITH reference to this agency’s despatch No. 60 of the 20th April, 1928, transmitting a list of Arab personalities, I have the honour to enclose biographical notes on Abdulla Suleiman and Tewfik-esh-Sherif for addition to the list. 2 . No circulation of this despatcli and its enclosure is being made from this post. I have, &amp;c. W. L. BOND. Enclosure in No. 1. Abdulla Suleiman. Biographical Notes. A Nejdi, probably from Riyadh, who started life as coffee boy to Qnsaibi, the Bahrein pearl merchant, in whose service he subsequently spent ten years in Bombay as Arabic clerk on 30 to 40 rupees a month. He was at one time a broker, but as such was declared insolvent. On the death of his brother, who was a correspondence clerk employed by Ibn Sand, Abdulla Suleiman, on the recommendation of Qusaibi, entered the royal service in his brother’s stead. He had no position of standing until the fall of Jeddah, when, in the general distribution of posts, he was appointed Reis-ed-Diwan. He gradually enlarged the scope of his activities to include charge of all household, Bedouin and finally financial affairs. His financial control has since last autumn been absolute. He seizes every penny that enters the revenue-earning departments, | and his omnipotence in the Ilejaz is unchallenged except perhaps by Fuad Hamza. He travels with a larger retinue and in greater state than Ibn Sand himself. (June 1929.) Tewfik-esh-Shcrif. He is sometimes called Tewfik Bey Sherif. Comes of a Yemeni family said to be of a certain importance, which has been established for the last century at Damascus. He is a graduate of the Turkish Military College and was a captain in the Turkish army. He was for many years the secretary of the Great Senussi, and accompanied Syed Senussi to Nejd and later to Mecca. Here he became appointed Rais-ed-Diwan of Naib-el-Am in Mecca. This post, however, he surrendered in favour of employment as Ibn Sand’s propagandist and unofficial agent abroad. In this capacity he visited India in 1926, afterwards visiting Germany, where he is reported to have had relations with Soviet agents. Apparently owing to the King’s distrust of his activities at this juncture, or possibly considering it expedient to disown him, a notice was published in the “ Um-el-Qura ” stating that Tewfik Bey Sherif was in Germany as a merchant, and had no connexion with the Hejaz Government. The local Hejaz officials, however, had no doubts as to the fact of his employment, especially as Tewfik Bey Sherif was known to be still sending confidential reports to the King and to the Emil Faisal at Mecca. Although a Syrian, he has privately declared himself to be opposed to Fuad Hamza, l ussuf \assin and the other Syrian opportunists in the country whom he accuses of dishonesty and whom he considers to have a malevolent influence on the King, particularly so far as Ibn Saud’s relations with His Majesty’s Government are concerned. He professes great concern for the future of Arabia and regret at the neglect of the country’s real interests under the Saudian regime, which, he declares, is now no better than that of King Hussein. He has a fair knowledge of French and some slight acquaintance with English, and has been spoken of as an alternative Foreign Minister to luad Hamza. Is small, gentle almost to timidity, and has a certain quiet charm. Physicially he is a weakling. (June 1929.) [927 a —1]J V 'T (fa tu ^0.

He Uvea in Jedda avowedly for preference, finding perfection in its notorious climats and maintaining that his frequent illnesses art attributable to a short stay in England in 1927. As a recent visitor to Jedda pertinently reinarked he trades on a spurious reputation as an expert on Arabia gained by his haring written three unreadable books on Hojd. He has to a marked degree that over^eeni.ng conceit and self assertion which he Is the first to object to in others. He seems always to have been unbalanced and middle age has intensified his intolerance and his offensive saorit de contradiction . socially he is a nuisance owing to his unfailing capacity for dropping oriels, of which the most notable recent example was his irunkenly toasting the fall of Bagdad at a general dinner party given by the Turkish representative in Jeula on the occasion of the Turkish National Fete. Politically he is a menace through his modest assumption of what he styles him/ i / N !hi8 'duty to do all in his powsr to prersnt His Majesty's Government from making a mess of their Arabian policy 11 * During the recent Hejd - Iraq troubles he strongly supported the Hejd point of view and criticized His Majesty's Government's policy both in speech and in the local press. There is a strong reason to believe that he continually urged on Ibn Saud an intransigeant attitude during the recent conversations of Sir Gilbert Clayton's mission and so may be held largely responsible for their adjournment. As a renegade living on a government pension he loudly denounces imperialism^ particularly British and Italian, as retarding the consummation of the Arab renaissance which is one of the fictions of his craay imagination. He is credited with the ambition to be the first man to cross the Hub el Khali. Such commercial success as he has achieved in Jedda he owes to his unholy alliance with Damluji (q*v.) He is agent for American oils, Ford and Studebaker oars and Singer Sewing Machines. (June 1928.)In any further communication on this subject, please quote _ r f&gt;A.

WITH reference to Lord Monteagle’s letter of the 11th February, I have the in Palestine and Transjordan, Delhi, Aden, Beirut, Damascus, Singapore, Khartum, through Port Sudan, Lagos (2). Hejaz and Nejd. Apparently a man of prepossessing appearance and strong character. (April 1928.) Emir Feisal ibn Abd-el-Aziz ibn Saud. Aged 27. Third surviving son of Ibn Saud and Viceroy of the Hejaz. Visited England in 1917 and 1926. Has not justified early hopes. His appearance bears out seems to be in keeping his masterful and ambitious tutor, Hafiz Wahba, the assistant Viceroy, at arm’s length. Is friendly with Mr. Philby, whom he met in Nejd in 1917-18 as a young boy. (April 1928.) Abdulla Damluji. Minister for Foreign Affairs. Formerly called Abdulla Said Effendi. A native of Mosul, he became a student in the Turkish Medical College at Constantinople, and is said to have stayed in Paris for a time. Styles himself “doctor,” but is reported not to have completed his studies before being expelled for unnatural vices, which are commonly considered to remain with him. He seems to have been serving in the Turkish army when Ibn Saud took Hasa in 1913, when he transferred his allegiance to the King. He was appointed to his present position on the fall of Jeddah. He attended the Uqair Conference in 1922 and signed the protocol as Ibh Saud’s representative. Took part in the negotiations leading to signature of the Treaty of Jeddah in 1927. He is on closest terms of intimacy with Mr. Philby, whom he met and accompanied in 1917, and whom there is reason to believe he consults on most questions of foreign policy. He is, moreover, in close business relations with Philby, for whose firm (Sharqieh, Limited) he has obtained certain Government contracts with large pecuniary benefit to himself. He is thoroughly mercenary. In 1926 he accompanied the Emir Feisal to London and brought back an increased delight in strong drink and cards. He is unpopular in Mecca, especially with stricter Moslems. He speaks French and a little English ; has pleasant manners and appearance and generally a European outlook; he can thus claim to be considered the best available man for his post. He exercises little independent authority in the absence of the honour to transmit herewith a first list of Arab personalities. 2. Copies of the enclosure to this despatch are being sent to Cairo, Bagdad, Jerusalem (2), Jerusalem for transmission to the Royal Air Force Officer Commanding I have, &amp;c. F. H. W. STONEHEWER-BIRD. Enclosure in No. 1. Arab Personalities. Emir Saud ibn Abd-el-Aziz ibn Saud. SECOND surviving son of Ibn Saud and his heir apparent. Governor of Nejd&gt; which he rarely leaves. In 1926 paid a short visit to Egypt to obtain eye treatment. Reported in March 1928 to have been proclaimed in Riyadh heir to the joint thrones of the current report that most of his time is devoted to the ladies of his household rather than to his official duties ; he has recently earned the contemptuous nickname of “ bint.” As Viceroy he has made no mark, and his chief official preoccupation [455 g—1]King, and the latter when in the Hejaz is his own Foreign Minister. Is Anglophile in * sentiment and would be more actively so if freed from the influence of his associate Philby. (April 1928.) Fuad Hamza. Assistant to Dr. Damluji. This young Syrian was educated at the Beirut Mia^Lni College and has a fair knowledge of English. He came to the Hejaz towards the^Jfl of 1926. He first gave English lessons to sons of Indian merchants residing in Mecca, and then secured an appointment in the Foreign Office through his compatriot Yusef Yassin, who was acting Foreign Minister in the absence of Dr. Damluji. He apes the strict Wahabi and scarcely conceals his contempt for his chief. During the negotiations which preceded the conclusion of the Treaty of Jeddah he supported the obstructions of Yusef Yassin. (April 1928.) Hafiz Wahba. Assistant Viceroy of the Hejaz. An Egyptian who maintains the closest relations with the Egyptian consul in Jeddah and travels on an Egyptian passport. Educated at El Azhar, he took an active part in the pan-Islamic movement. Was strongly anglophobe during the Great War and was deported from Egypt and India, where he was in touch with the Khalifat movement. Established himself in Koweit, where he opened a school. Followed Ibn Saud to Riyadh and in the subsequent Hejaz campaign. After the fall of Jeddah he became sole administrator of Mecca. In the Hej azhe is jmglopfeile and a strong opponent of the Syrian group in Mecca Was one of the King’s counsellors during the negotiations at Bahra in 1925 and at Jeddah in 1927. He incurred royal displeasure late in 1927 owing to an incident in connexion with the negotiations regarding the Egyptian “ Mahmal.” His nomination to represent Ibn Saud at the abortive Koweit Conference of 1927 was generally accepted to be a device for his temporary removal from the Hejaz. His practice as Assistant Viceroy of working independently and without instructions has caused him to be cordially detested by the Emir Feisal. (April 1928.) Yusef Yassin. Apparently of Syrian origin. Former pupil of Rashaid-el-Riza, editor of “ El Mnar,” of Egypt. An ardent Wahabi and religious fanatic with strong anglophobe and stronger francophobe tendencies. Editor of the “ Um-el-Qura,” the Mecca newspaper, and has acted as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the absence of Dr. Damluji. Was one of the King’s counsellors during the negotiations resulting in the Bahra and Hadda agreements, 1925. He was extremely obstructive throughout the conversations • which preceded the signing of the Treaty of Jeddah. In all his dealings with the British Agency has proved himself an arch-obstructionist and hair-splitter. Of unpleasant appearance and boorish manners. He accompanied Ibn Saud to Nejd in October 1927. (April 1928.) Abdulla Fadl. Native of Qasim (Anaiza) and formerly subject of Ibn Rashid. Became Jeddah manager of Ibn Sand’s favourite business house of Messrs. Ibrahim Mohammed Salih- el-Fadl, of Bombay and Karachi. Rendered many services to Ibn Saud, for which he suffered imprisonment at the hands of King Hussein. Earned Ibn Saud’s gratitude, but was for long the butt of all cheap local wit. Was present at the discussions preceding conclusion of the Treaty of Jeddah. Was appointed Ibn Saud’s delegate for the discussions on the subject of the Italian recognition of Ibn Saud, and proceeded to Asmara, where he achieved conspicuous unsuccess. His appointment as Acting Assistant Viceroy of the Hejaz in November 1927, in the absence of Hafiz Wahba, seems to have brightened up his wits and his appearance. (April 1928.) Mohammed Abd er Uahman-el-Fadl. Half-brother of Abdulla from whom he took over the management of the Jeddah branch of Messrs. Ibrahim Mohammed Salih-el-Fadl. A simple man with no apparent interest in politics. Has some influence with Ibn Saud. (April 1928.) Haji Zeinal Ali Heza, Elder half-brother of the Kaimakam of Jeddah. Came to the Hejaz as a domestic servant in a Persian household and peddled his way into commerce. As a member ofone of the wealthiest houses in Jeddah he suffered considerably under King Hussein’s practice of raising forced loans. Is over 75 years of age and rapidly breaking up, a process accelerated by the death in Constantinople in 1927 of his son Kasim. His son Yusef manages the Bombay branch of the business, the Jeddah direction of which isnow in the hands of the Kaimakam. The other surviving son, Mohammed Ali, is a ^i^piuent pearl merchant in Bombay where he is a member of the Haj Committee. s son also gives monetary support to a school in Mecca and one in Jeddah (Mudrasset-el-Fulal). (April 1928.) Abdulla Ali Ueza. Kaimakam of Jeddah. Followed his half-brother Haji Zeinal to the Hejaz and helped him to build up the present business. Married well and then spent fifteen years in commerce in Bombay. On his return to Jeddah he assumed control of the Haji Zeinal business. Appointed Kaimakam of Jeddah under King Hussein and has held the post ever since. Probably the richest man in Jeddah. Agent for the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company (Limited) and the Oriental Navigation Company (Limited). Has been known to use his official authority to further his commercial interests but enjoys the almost unique distinction of being incorruptible. A man of sterling qualities and deservedly general popularity. (April 1928.) Mohammed Husein Nasif. Grandson of Omar Nasif of Egyptian origin who came to Jeddah to work as a coolie, advanced in position under the Turks and obtained a post in the Sultan’s household in Constantinople before finally returning to the Hejaz to become the richest property owner in Jeddah. Mohammed Husein Nasif has some reputation as an Arabic scholar, and claims to have the only library in Jeddah. He is an ardent Wahabi, thus incurring the enmity of the ex-King Hus^ien, who did not hesitate to exact frequent loans from him. He houses Ibn Saud when the latter comes to Jeddah. Is said to be untrustworthy and for that reason to have been given no office, but has a fine air of mingled wisdom and benevolence. (April 1928.) Suleiman Aman Gabil. lakes his name from the now extinct Jeddah Gabil family who emancipated his father, a slave of Abyssinian origin. Worked as a shop assistant, and finally became a merchant with connexions in Medina. Made Reis-el-Beledia, a minor and paid appoint ment, under the Turkish regime, and continued to hold that office under the ex-King Hussein, with whom he was a great favourite. He made hay while the sun shone, and is now probably the third richest man in Jeddah. Agent for the Shustari Line. Managing director of the Shirket-es-Saudia, the pilgrim motor transport company inaugurated by Ibn Saud. A lively and entertaining host. (April 1928.) Abd-el-Qadir Gabil. Younger brother of Suleiman Gahil, by whom he is completely outshone. A quiet charming man with a boyish face. He helps in his brother’s business, and is credited with no political interest. Suleiman Shejiq Pasha. formerly Turkish Military Governor of Basra, from which post he was withdrawn at the outbreak of the Great YYar. Became Minister for War in Damar Ferid Pasha’s Cabinet. Fled to Egypt from Mustapha Kemal. Came to the Hejaz early in 1926, and acted as chief organiser of the Islamic Conference that &gt; ear. Appointed Inspector- General of Government Offices, but met with some opposition in this office, so became chief engineer of the Jeddah-Mecea road. Of the latter he has in six months covered with sand two kilom. of small and large boulders at a cost of £16,000. Arthur Van de Poll. Apostate Dutchman who has assumed the Moslem name of Haji Mohammed Husein-el-Mahdi. Said to be the younger son of a good Dutch family and is one of the richest men in Jeddah. Married as his second and probably bigamous wife an i\byssinian, whom he maintains in dusky splendour in Monte Carlo. Agent for the Holt Line.
