Prepared by the Arab Bureau, Cairo. FIRST EDITION, JANUARY 15, 1917. CAIRO. Government Press. 1917.PREFATORY NOTE. This Handbook has been compiled by Major K. Corn- wallis and Lieut.-Commander D. G. Hogarth, R.N.V.R., from information obtained in Cairo (especially about Tribes and Personalities), and from material prepared for the Arabia Handbook, issued by the Admiralty War Staff, Intelligence Division. The latter material (Chapters I-VII, XI, and XII) has been supplemented by native information, and, to some extent, recast. For some of the Tihamah tribes and two Route Reports, the compilers are indebted to notes, supplied from Aden by Col. R.A. Wauchope, R.E. In a subsequent edition or supplement it is hoped to add to the Route Reports schedules and descriptions of more cross roads in the interior of Yemen, information about which is now being collected in Cairo. The outline map, published herewith, takes account of a manuscript staff map, captured from a Turkish officer, made prisoner in Hejaz. This covers Central Yemen be tween north latitudes 16 0 '15 and 14 o '30, and between west longitudes 42° and 44 o '30. From its appearance and such tests as we have been able to apply, we conclude tlmt it is a more reliable map than the Turkish staff maps of Yemen previously known. It is being reproduced in Cairo. The sketch map of Southern Yemen, issued by Aden, has also been compared.cD CONTENTS. Page.

I.—AREA. This district lies between Asir {v. ' Asir Handbook') and the Aden Protectorate, i .e. roughly, between north latitude 17° and north latitude 13°; but neither its northern nor its southern boundary is drawn at anything like right angles to the Red Sea coast line, and, while the general trend of both these boundary-lines is north-eastward, neither runs at all straight. The northern limit, which, in the interior, is determined by a religious criterion (the population to the north of it is Sunni of the Shafe i school and that to the south is Shiah of the Zeidist sect), makes a sharp elbow almost due north after starting north-eastward from Wadi c Ain, above Loheiah (Lahiyah). Then it resumes its eastward direction, crossing longitude 45° east (the some what indefinite inland or eastern limit) north-east of Sa dah. The southern boundary, starting from Sheikh Said, runs east-north-east to Qa'tabah, and then north-east till it crosses the 45th meridian. It is determined by political considerations combined with religious, but it is not a satisfactory line of distinction, though the only one in Arabia duly delimited according to treaty (in 1902-1905). The total area thus enclosed is about 225 miles long, north to south, and 150 miles broad, with a content of about 33,750 square miles. It constitutes the major part of the theoretical Turkish province of Yemen ; the remainder lies m Asir, which is considered a scm^cik of the vilayet of San ? a. The Porte lays claim to the hmteilcind, as far back as the Red Desert (Er-Raml or Ruba el-Khali), but since nothing to the east of the San a plateau has ever been effectively held or administered by the Turks, the 45th meridian may be taken as the boundary of Yemen.n._pHYSICAL CHARACTER. Relief. Yemen is the south-western angle and culmination of the tilted land-shelf which makes Arabia. This shelf slopes up from north-east till it attains, on the San a plateau, a general elevation of over 7,000 feet, and, in masse ®. ^ the southern extremity of the Mam Gable Ridge, whic defines the whole shelf on the west, summit heights ot over 9 000 feet. From these the land falls steeply on botli faces of the angle to the sea. Therefore, not only the Red Sea slope, but that to the Indian Ocean is geographically part of Yemen; but since the latter is politically distinct, and has a special interest for us as the Aden Protectorate, it is not included in this Handbook. _ The longitudinal zones of Hejaz and Asir are con tinued in Yemen. These are (1) Tihamah, or low littoral belt; (2) Maritime Range ; (3) Intramontane uplands; (4) Main Ridge ; (5) Plateau, sloping away north-eastward towards the great central desert. The last has a less even decline than in Asir and Hejaz, being at first a table-land which breaks down rather abruptly amid low ridges and foothills, enclosing habitable basins without outlets (such as those of Mareb and Jauf), before it merges into the Ruba' el-Khali. (1) The Tihamah resembles that of Asir in character, having a comparatively regular, low, and coralline coast-line, behind which rises a long, dusty, and even slope, attaining about 600 feet at the base of the Maritime Range. But it is less uniformly barren. The incidence of the monsoon, and the large 'catchment area provided by the complex highland system behind it, cause this Tihamah to hold moreground-water and receive more surface flow down its wddis. Consequently it supports, not only far more village life than the Asir and Hejaz littorals, but also considerable urban communities, beside port-towns. There is nothing in Asir (still less in Hejaz) to correspond to the inland towns of the Yemen Tihamah, Beit el-Faqih, Zebid, and Hais, besides several large villages like Zeidiyah, Marawah, Mansuriyah, etc., which are all but towns. Some islands lie off this coast; but, except the Kamaran group, about ten miles south of Loheiah, and Perim, off Sheikh Sa'id, no one island of any importance is near enough to the mainland to be reckoned to Yemen. The Yemen Tiha mah varies in breadth from some thirty miles in the north, about Hodeidah, to a few hundred yards in the south, near Sheikh Sa'id. (2) The Maritime Range again is a feature which Yemen has in common with the rest of the West Arabian littoral. It once more attains the elevation it reached in Midian, Mount Shibam, above Menakhah, being nearly, if not quite, 9,000 feet high. But it is a more complicated and extensive system in Yemen than in Hejaz, and betrays more clearly its derivation from the wasted western edge of the main shelf. It throws out long spurs into the Tihamah, and encloses long wddis, the greater of which originate behind it, and give access by their valleys to the Main Ridge. Such, ior example, is the Wadi Siham, which debouches south of Hodeidah. The Maritime Range is extensively cultivated in terraces. (3) The Intramontane Uplands lie at an average eleva tion of some 4,000 feet. They have a valley, rather than plateau, character, and are intersected by foothills and ridges and studded with solitary hillocks. (4) The Main Ridge varies in altitude from 7,000 to 9,000 feet, and occasional swells (rather than peaks) rise yet another 1,000 feet or more. It is seamed with deep ravines and valleys which often are lined with cultivation and dotted with villages, especially in the southern part near the Aden border.(5) The Plateau zone, being all that lies beyond the Main Ridge, is, as has been said above, of table-land character at first, and following the general trend, slopes up to the southward till it reaches its culmination (9,000 feet) south of Tbb. At San'a its level is about 7,500 feet. In the western part it is not unfertile, though less productive than the fourth and third zones, and it is interspersed with more frequent barren areas. . As it declines in the eastern part, it becomes predominantly a dusty steppe with occa sional oases in low-lying basins which immediately precede the Great Desert. The edge of the latter, like that of the Northern Nefud of Arabia, rises high above the level of the steppe, and springs and wells are found near the border-line of the two tracts. This eastern zone does not send, like the corresponding zones of Asir and Hejaz, any large drainage channels into Central Arabia, its waters, mainly carried by the adi Kharid, being unable to pass the great obstruction of the Red Desert. But from the extreme north (Nejran) a con siderable wddi flows north by east to an unknown destination. The characteristics of the landscape in these five zones will be dealt with later in greater detail under the different districts. Climate. The climate of Yemen naturally varies very greatly, both in temperature and rainfall, according to altitude and district. The coast is extremely damp, and, though sea-breezes lower the temperature, excessive humidity makes the heat very trying. Heavy winds are prevalent from the sea, from the north-west in summer and the south-west in winter, both being uncomfortably damp. Winds from the east usually bring sandstorms. Rain seldom falls on the coast. The inner Tihamah is fiercely hot by day andfairly cool by night, but it is comparatively free from the enervating dampness of the coastline. The rainfall is scanty and irregular. The Maritime Range and Intramontane Uplands have a feverish climate with close, muggy nights,_ especially in the rainy season among the foothills ; but in proportion as the elevation increases, the air becomes more healthy and bracing. The chief rainfall occurs in _ spring; but, on the higher ground, there is some precipitation in summer as well, chiefly in thunderstorms. On the Mam Ridge, at 5,000 feet elevation and above, winter fogs are prevalent. The mists come up from the ravines in the earlv afternoon, and lie thick till next morning and sometimes all next day. They are not, however, without their advantage, as they favour the growth and development of the coffee plant. This zone, with its regular rainfall, due to the influence chiefly of the south-west monsoon, may be considered the most favoured district of Arabia. It has indeed two rainy seasons, one in early spring and another in late summer with the north-west monsoon. The inland Plateau has a much drier climate, of which that of San'a may be taken as fairly typical. Here it is cool and pleasant all the year round ; the nights are cold in winter, but the' days warm, and in the summer the heat, though considerable, is not oppressive, owing to the dryness of the air, a difference of more than 20° being sometimes observed between the wet and dry bulb thermometer readings in May. It is not, however, necessarily a healthy climate, high altitude in tropical countries involving anaemia and other peculiar disadvantages. The eastern slope, however, has much smaller and less certain rainfall than the west. The bulk of it is expected in summer, but the wet periods are often short, and local droughts are not uncommon.III.—POPULATION. High estimates are to be distrusted for Yemen as for Asir.* Judging by the urban total (not above 150,000 inhabitants in all, in some twenty principal towns) and by the highest figures ever given for a levy en masse by the Imam, when Yemen has been most united against the Turks, one may doubt if the gross population exceeds a million. It is almost all more or less settled, three fourths of it living 'in villages, hamlets, or farms. Except in the north-east, • there is only a comparatively small nomadic element, and that mainly in the Tihamah. Jews. —In contrast to Asir and Hejaz, however, Yemen holds a considerable body of inhabitants of non-Moslem creed, namely Jews, said to number nearly 100,000, if the distant inland oasis of Nejran be reckoned to Yemen. They are most numerous in Hodeidah and San'a, where they have their own quarters ; but they are found recognized, tolerated, and despised, in all the towns and in some villages. Mainly noted as craftsmen, they have secured for themselves much tolerance ; for they are acknowledged, by Turk and Arab alike, to be an important and useful economic factor in the development of the country. At Menakhah, for example, the best smiths and carpenters are all Jews. Theirs is, however, in general, a rather harried existence, and now that the Imam's influence is coming to the fore again and the Shari'a Law is predominant, their position promises to be in jeopardy. Jews are subject to certain disabilities. Though not interfered with in their religious practices, they are not * ihe figures given by native estimates- for Asir and repeated in 'Asir Handbook' (one and a half millions) are, beyond question, exag gerated. The half would be a liberal estirdate.allowed to have schools or synagogues, but assemble for worship at private houses and their children are taught at home. Nor may they build their houses more than two storeys high. They are outwardly distinguished from the Arabs by their dress—an ungirded tunic of print or cotton reaching only to the knees and a close-fitting skull ca p— anc l by the absence of weapons. They dress their hair after a peculiar fashion, with plaits hanging down on each cheek. They are not allowed to ride in the towns, and even outside them they must dismount when passing a Moslem. Nevertheless, it would not be correct (at least for the present) to describe them as a persecuted community. The law has been administered fairly with regard to them, and, being remarkably industrious, they are on the whole prosperous and contented. But, of late years, there has been a tendency among them to emigrate, largely, it appears, to Jerusalem. Every male adult pays a capita tion tax of one riydl. Other aliens include about 1,000 British Indians, and a few Greeks and other Levantines mainly resident in the coast towns. ' Arabs. —This population varies a good deal in type in different districts, thanks partly to differences of origin, partly to climate influences. (1) The Tihdmah. —Along this belt the natives are slightly built and dark, and betray a strong negroid taint ' due to mixture with the negro slave element. Once this strain was established, intermarriage with the pure Arabs became regular within certain limits. Quadroon girls are frequently married by Arabs, but no girls of pure Arab stock would 'be given in marriage to a mulatto, still less to a negro. The countrymen are almost exclusively agricultural. The Arab merchant class in the towns of this belt (or for that matter in all parts of Yemen) is chiefly of the tall Ishmaelite type.(2) The Highlands. —On the mountain ranges and massifs we find the true mountaineer type, taller and bigger- limbed than the lowlander and of lighter complexion. There is no negroid taint in the Yemen hills, but there has been some amount of intermarriage (confined to the mechan ical and menial classes) with women of the serf class of (possibly) Abyssinian or Persian origin. (3) The Maritime Range, which skirts the Tihamah, is peopled by a type intermediate between (1) and (2). Here one observes the swarthy complexion of the plainsmen, but without any negroid taint, except in the towns and large settlements, where the tribal types have been merged. (4) On the Eastern Plateau, towards the south-west edge of the Great Red Desert, there is a taller race again, showing every trace of the Ishmaelite immigration, which probably came from Jauf. These eastward dwellers are known collectively, by the Yemenis, as Ahl el-Mashriq, and are feared for their dour fanaticism and fierce impetuous character. As in the adjoining province of Hadhramaut, the Arabs are divided into four main classes, viz. (1) Seyyids or Ashrdf, descendants of the Prophet, forming; a religious aristocracy ; (2) tribesmen or Qabeil, belonging to the Qahtan, or original South Arabian stock, who form the bulk of the population and are the only class habitually carrying arms ; (3) the trading classes ; and (4) the servile class, mostly of mixed African descent and including the Jews. Religion. The Central Yemen follows the Zeidi sect, a survival of Arabian Shiism, called after Zeid a great-grandson of the Caliph r Ali. It was established in the Yemen by the Imam Yahya el-Hadi, a.d . 901. Through him the present Imam of Yemen claims descent from Fatimah, daughter of the Pro phet. The Zeidists approach the Orthodox Sunni more nearly, perhaps, than any other Shiah sect. They are, ina sense, 'trimmers.' They hold that a true leader of the faithful must be of the Prophet's own seed; for only so can he have the esoteric knowledge and supernatural qualities such as infallibility, which their instinct for incarnationism and desire to worship their ruler as semi-divine demand. The first three Caliphs were not such leaders, but Zeidists accept them on the principle that leaders, worthy of reverence, but not of worship, can be appointed now and then for reasons of expediency. An Imam who is a true leader and a Caliph who is 1 a political expedient can, therefore, co-exist. The dwellers on the eastern plateau are all Orthodox Moslems, who regard the Sunna as canonical, and guide their conduct thereby. There is no love lost between the two great sects in Yemen. In the Tihamah also, the Sunni (Shafe'i) doctrine is paramount. At Hodeidah, however, a few Zeidis from up country may be found. The Sunni creed and practices extend in some parts (Hajjeilah, for instance) some distance back into the maritime range. The .Yemeni is not particularly fanatical. Seeing the sects into which his own people are divided, he realizes that there are two sides to every question. Hence his not unfriendly attitude to the Jews. Tribes. Tribal Organization is dealt with more fully in Section IX. Practically all the native Yemenis, settled as well as nomad, are members of tribes, and think and fight as such. Enumerated from north to south, first in the Tihamah then in the Highlands, the chief tribes with their localities are :— 1. Tihamah. In the extreme north are the Wa'azat immediately above Loheiah and in touch and continual feud with Idrisi and the Beni f Abs. Consequent favour and support accorded to them by the Turks have unduly magnified them and theirchiefs. Below them, inland and south of Loheiah, lies a group of small tribes, the Jami , Beni Qeis, Beni Mohammed, and Zahliyah. Uncertainty about their allegiance has led to the most numerous of these tribes, the Beni Qeis, being courted by the Turks ; more especially since the caravan trade up Wadi Mur is, more or less, in its hands. In the Hodeidah hinterland and the administrative district of Zeidiyah, we find the more considerable Suleil, who, with two lesser (and perhaps not distinct) tribes, the Manari and Hashabiri, form a strong pro-Turk wedge extending back to the foothills. The powerful and com paratively wealthy Quhrah, their southern neighbours, who lie along the first part of the main Hodeidah-tSan' a road, share their pro-Turk sympathies, but are not their friends ; though, in common also with the next group in order to the south, the 'Absiyah, they hang together in religious matters, all looking to an influential Shafe'i Seyyid of Mansuriyah as their spiritijal leader. Approaching the district of Beit el-Faqih, we meet the largest and most notorious, though not the most united, of the Tihamah tribes, the Zaraniq, divided into two great sections, northern and southern (Sham and Yemen). They hold a broad belt right across the Tihamah, encircling Beit el-Faqih and Zebid and cutting all communications between Hodeidah and Mokhah. They extend also into the foothills of the Maritime Eange. South of them lie none but unimportant tribelets, such as the Kokhah near Mokhah, until the limit of the Aden hinterland is reached in the Subeihi country. The Tihamah tribes are, in general, Sunnis of the Shafe'i school, exceptions being confined to a few small sub-sections and families. 2. Highlands. (a) In Northern Yemen, i.e. above a line drawn from Hodeidah to 'Amran, we find, on the Asir border : first, in the Maritime Range and filling the large district of— 11 — Hajur, a group of some eleven small agricultural tribes of mixed Zeidi and Sunni (Shafe'i) profession and divided in their allegiance between the Turks, the Imam, and Idrisi [see p. 54 for names); and then, beyond them, a section of the great Hashid federation {see below). Beyond these again, towards the north-east above Sa'dah, lie the Hamdan esh-Sham, the detached northern section of a very large Zeidi tribe, whose other section is settled on the central highlands near San'a. The northern Hamdan are, by themselves, very numerous and formidable. They extend to the almost desert country of the Yam tribes, centred on Nejran, and lying outside the proper limits of Yemen, as treated here. West and south-west of the Hamdan come important Zeidi tribes, filling up the space between Sa^dah and Hajur, viz. the Beni Juma/a, the Ahl Razah (of Jebel Razah) and the Khaulan esh- Sham, the last being one of the sheet-anchors of the Imam's power, and a detached section of a large tribe, of which the remainder lies in the eastern part of the central high lands. Immediately about Sa'dah itself, and ranging eastward, are smaller, but not unimportant, Zeidi tribes, the Beni Murran, the Sahar (many nomads), the A1 Ammar, and A1 Damaj ; and then, as we leave Sa'dah for Khamir, we encounter the greatest tribal and territorial unity in Southern Arabia, the Hashid wa Bekil, a group or confederation which lies right across the high lands from near the Hajur boundary to the easternmost oases, envelopes Khamir, and almost touches 'Amran. This is the realm of Nasir Ibn Mabkhut, the most powerful person in the Yemen after, perhaps, the Imam. On the nature and constituents of this great federation, see page 62. The chief tribe of the Eastern Oases, the Dhu Husein, lies outside the geographical limits of the Yemen, as pre scribed for this Handbook, but is included on page 71,. because of its intimate connection with the Hashid and the politics of Northern Yemen. In the rest of North Yemen, i.e. on the western fringe below Hajur, we have a group of small settled Zeidi tribes.in the Hajjah district, viz. the Zufeir, Beni Marhab, and Hajjah; and, on the west, in and near the Kaukeban district, the Beni Husein, 'Udhaqah, Beni Aw warn, and Serbih, all adherents of the Imam. (6) The high road from Hodeidah to San ? a passes through some of the richest and also most difficult country in Yemen. The tribes settled in the Maritime Range and Intramontane Uplands along this main artery (after the Quhrah country has been left near ? Obal), are: first, in and about Jebel Milhan, the Hufash, Mahweit, and Sari, all Zeidi and pro-Imam; secondly, on the opposite side of the road, in and about Jebel Bura/a, the Bura/a of Sunni profession, and the Ahl Reimah, in the massif of that name, which trends away southward, and is the richest agricultural district of Yemen. Two small remnants of earlier Isma'iliyah domination in this region, the Makarimah and Ya'aber, and, after them, the Beni Isma'il, who are Sunni, bring us to Menakhah. Round the latter town lies a group of small tribes profes sing Dawudiyah tenets. On account of their isolation among Zeidists or Sunnites they tend to stand with the Turks, unless so strongly ensconced in the hills as to dare to turn their hand against every man. Extending as far as Mefhak, they have served, at moments of Zeidist rebellion, to save the Turks from losing Menakhah and the most difficult stretch of the San'a road. Of these tribes, the Metwah and Beni Safan lie north and west of Menakhah; the Beni Khotab, south; and the Beni 'Ahlas, Muqatil, and Beni Murrah, eastward. (c) In Southern 1 emen we meet, on either flank of San'a itself, to the north-east, the Hasheish, and to the north west, the Hamdan el-Yemen, the last the other part of the great tribe whose northern section has been mentioned a Dove. Ihese two restless tribes, both secretly disaffected, are a source of uneasiness to the Turkish headquarters. About Kibs and on the eastern plateau lies a considerable— 13 — and important tribe, the Khaulan et-Tawal, anti-Turk and pro-Imam ; and west of San'a are some small Zeidist units, the Beni Hebeish, Kama'lah, and Senhan. The main tribal unit, however, in this region, is the Anis, a very ancient settled tribe, which occupies a large block of territory west of the main north-south road and embracing all the main ridge from near Mefhak down to the latitude of Dhamar. This tribe, with all its immediate neighbours, is Zeidist. The rest of Southern Yemen, from Dhamar to Qa'tabah, is held by three large tribes, the Ahl ' Ammar, the Ahl Sha'ir, and the Ahl el- 'Ud, all settled agricul turists, with some smaller units here and there, e.g. the Rada 5 a, in and about the town of that name, and the Mekhadir, near Jiblah. Domestic Life and Appliance. A sharp line must be drawn between the life of the littoral population and that of the highlanders. (i) In the loivlands pastoral clans range and settle as grazing and water dictate. The black goat-hair tents of the more inland desert-dwellers are rarely seen, but the natives raise huts of matting on poles, with an entrance covered with a piece of matting and no other aperture. Furniture is scant and light, so that movement may be easy : a wooden bed laced with palm cord, a few gourds for sour milk, some conical-lidded baskets for stores, a primitive water-pipe made out of an empty cocoa-nut, and several vessels of crude green-glazed earthenware, complete the domestic apparatus ; and one family one hut is the rule, with no attempt to separate the sexes. Food rarely includes meat, and the staple diet consists of round flat unleavened cakes, eaten with liquid butter or sesame oil, and dates. The corn is not ground by querns of the ordinary type, which would be heavy to carry; it is moistened and then crushed on a concave stone with a stone pestle grasped with both hands and rubbed to and fro, a process requiring much effort and patience and— 14 — usually performed by the young girls when they are not engaged in bringing water from the often distant well. The favourite beverage is a liquor made of coffee-husks, ginger, and cardamon. A stew of meat, made in an earthen jar, with plentiful addition of hovaij —a mixture of pepper corns, cinnamon, and nutmeg—is a favourite dish. Clothes are unusually scanty in this torrid climate. The characteristic dress of the men is a coloured cotton kilt, belted round the waist, and the sole garment of the boys is a piece of cotton fabric. Females of all classes wear a long slip of navy-blue cotton, which they also sleep in, merely removing their necklaces of beads, and covering their feet with the shawl which serves as a hood during the day. Along the inner edge of the Tihamah and among the foothills, where more settled agricultural pursuits are followed, little stone tower-like huts, gathered in scattered groups, take the place of mat huts; but the food, clothing, and habits are not dissimilar to the foreo-oin» O O (ii) On the highlands, native life contrasts very sharply with that prevailing in the lowlands; arable spots are much more extensive and frequent, and fixed settlements become the rule. All villages are fortresses, often perched eyrie like on hills at the very edge of awesome abysses, and many well away from any recognized route. All the towns and villages have certain features in common. They stand usually on a difficult crest of bare rock, from which rises a lofty rampart of towers, the gaps between being filled by curtains of stone masonry ; the keep of the chieftain rears its battlements above all.. Even villages have mas sive mam gates ; the streets, usually steep, are often of slippery rock and bordered by loop-holed houses and towers. The only civilians are the artizan, mechanical, and servile classes. The houses in general are either entirely stone-built or have at least their lower storeys of well-hewn dark basalt, e oge er without mortar, and the superstructures of— 15 — sun-dried brick. The larger houses are very tall and have a tendency to taper upwards, which often gives them the appearance of truncated pyramids. The fagades are usually of stucco, whitewashed and ornamented with a chevron pattern. They are rambling structures with bewildering passages, spiral stone staircases, tiny casements adorned with stained glass, and loopholes everywhere in the lower storeys. The interiors are usually divided into long narrow rooms with many windows. All large houses have massive embossed doors of acacia wood, with solid wickets set in them, the latter so arranged that the bolt can be raised from above. The dwellings of the wealthy are sometimes well, not to say luxuriously, furnished. The dress of the highland Yemen Arabs is peculiar to themselves. The town-bred natives of San 5 a wear silk robes, girdled at the waist, large white turbans, and square- toed sandals. They nearly all carry a shoulder-cloth which they wrap around their heads in cold weather, and they seldom wear the jihbah. This costume, though it is soupposed to denote an educated man {i.e. one versed in the religious law), is assumed in practice by any one who can afford it. The dress of the countryman, the moun taineer, and the poorer class of townspeople, is more striking and picturesque. It consists of a black turban fastened in a peculiar manner, a black shirt reaching to the knees, with sleeves as wide as the shirt itself, and over it, in full dress, a coloured loin-cloth and most voluminous sash. These cloths are made in the Yemen, and are coarse and very strong. The dye is indigo and is not fast. Nor does its volatility matter, since the Yemenis like to smear it over their faces and hands. This habit, and their long black curls carefully oiled, give them an appearance that is sometimes scarcely human. The Turkish women are dressed in black and thickly veiled. The Arab women are wrapped in coloured clothes and like wise closely veiled in towns. In the country they go un covered, and in some parts they wear tightish trousers. 0— 1G — Boots, of red or yellow colour, not sandals, are usually worn. The weapon of the Yemen highlander is the jambiyah, a short dagger with a broad curved blade, which fits into a Y-shaped sheath worn at the waist. The handle is generally of horn ornamented with silver, and the whole weapon, including the blade, is made locally. No male, after boyhood, would be seen abroad without his jambiyah. The Arabs are very expert in its use; they hold it with the point downward and the curve inward, and in attacking always aim for the supra-sternal notch. If this blow is rightly placed, it splits open the whole chestwall, and is instantly fatal. Another weapon is the sabikah, nearly as long as a sword-bayonet and worn cross ways in the belt; this latter needs a powerful man to wield it effectively. The Yemen Arabs drink coffee made of the husk rather than of the bean. These husks locally fetch a higher price than the berry; in taste the beverage, known as Jcishr, is said to remind one of hot barley-water. But their chief indulgence is in the leaf of the kat tree {see p. 34). u ^ ens ^ 8 are often of copper or brass, and are skilfully made ; copper and brass used to be much worked at ban a in particular, but the art has declined in recent years.IV.—DISTRICTS AND TOWNS. North Yemen. Above a line drawn from Hodeidah to 'Amran, little is known precisely of the interior. Only the town of Loheiah and some other points on the coast have been visited by European travellers. The highland part of North Yemen (as here defined), forming five-sixths of the whole, is distinguished socially and politically as having been the original home of Zeidism and the stronghold of the Zeidi Imams against the Turks. First we have, as lowland, a rather sterile wedge of Tihamah broadening back from the sea for about twenty-five miles. From the Asir boun dary to Wadi Mur this is the home of the Wa'zat and smaller Sunni tribes, and is cultivated only in patches. But as we ascend the great Wadi Mur into the foothills, we soon reach the fertile country of Hajur el-Yemen, the value of which the Turks have recognized by maintaining in its midst the fortified post of Qufl. It lies for the most part in the intra- montane region, between the Maritime Range, here mainly pastoral, and the Main Ridge, and on the right bank slopes of the Mur basin. The best country is in Mikhlaf esh-Sham. which is noted for coffee, hat, and fruits, and covered with terraced cultivation. Jebel Murran, lying north of this, is also rich coffee country; and fertility is maintained east ward to Jebel Razah and through Hajur esh-Sham to the Khaulan country, where, however, as the elevation increases and the down-like Main Ridge is reached, wheat begins to take the place of coffee and kat. Near the mouth of Wadi Mur lies the one important coast town of North Yemen, Loheiah, and, on the watershed above its northerly headwaters, the main inland centre, Sa'dah. Between the two passes a brisk caravan trade which follows the Mur valley for a while on its way up to Khamir isee Route No. 14), and goes thence to Sa'dah by Route No. 8.(1) Loheiah is a fair-sized Red Sea port, situated on the northern side of a small shallow bay, with poor anchorage for small craft only, and difficult of approach because of reefs. It has dhow traffic with Jiddah, Hodeidah, and Aden, exports small quantities of coffee, and imports grain. The population is about 5,000, and seems to have risen in recent years, for in 1881 the number of inhabitants was estimated at 2,000 only. There are several hillocks at the back of the town, on one of which (alt. 150 feet) is a fort of some strength where some modern guns are mounted. Loheiah is used as a base of operations in Asir ; the garrison, normally, however, is a battalion. Water is scarce and brackish. There is telegraphic communication, south with Hodeidah, and north with Midi. (2) Sa dah is the northernmost town in Yemen, the focus of Zeidism and the seat of the original Zeidist dynasty. It is said to be as large as the native (Arab) quarters of San'a; to be surrounded by an old and ruinous wall and to be in a plain wider than that of San f a, with much cultivation and irrigation from very shallow wells. The gates are five: suq and government buildings are in the south quarter, as is also the chief mosque (El Hadi). Eastward of Sa dah the tribes [see pp. 11, 57) soon begin to be reported semi-nomadic or wholly nomadic, a sure sign that down-like pastoral country prevails. This region has the reputation of being bleak and inclement and appar- entlj it deteriorates to steppe and even desert, till the great depression of Nejran, the settled centre of the semi-nomadic Yam clans, is reached. South of Wadi Mur, as far as Hodeidah, the littoral is v® r &gt; unfertile and almost desert, but fertility begins with the first foothills; and from these lands and the control of the caravan traffic up Wadi Mur come the means of existence of the Beni Suleil, who own one village almostof urban rank, Zeidiyah. The Quhrah, who own Bajil, ? Obal, and Hajjeilah, important settlements on the Hodeidah-San'a road, are in similar case. Following up the left bank slopes of the Mur basin without turning up the valleys of its main tributaries, the Wadi La'a and A\adi Dhubawa, we are soon in the Hashid country, which, from the descriptions given of that federation, must be less fertile than the right bank slopes, and only intermit tently cultivated. Probably the down-like region spreads westward here. On the Main Ridge here lie the Hashid urban centres, Khamir, Huth, and Qafilat f Udhr. (3) Khamir (Khamr), situated about ninety miles east by north of Loheiah, is a large Hashid town at a high eleva tion on the Main Ridge at the head of Wadi Dhibin, and is exposed to an unusually bleak climate for Yemen. It is surrounded by a ruined wall and is said to have a population of 6,000, but very little is known about it, as it has never been described by any European traveller, though one (Glaser) has visited it. It is the present capital of the Imam; but, after the establishment of the entente with the Turk, it was garrisoned by Turkish troops. It has a busy weekly market. Sheharah, the hill-fort of the Imam (also at one time garrisoned by Turks), lies above Qafilat c Udhr, about twenty miles north-west, in the wildest Hashid country. These fighting tribes admit neither the Imam's nor any other outside authority, except under constant pressure. Sheharah is practically impregnable, being approa ched by only one very steep and easily defended road. (4) Huth is a walled town about fifteen miles north of Khamir on the main road to Sa'dah. It is largely inhabited by Seyyids and Ashrdf and is the rival of Sa'dah and San'a in learning. (5) Qafilat c Udhr is a walled town ruled from Huth, and dominated by the castle of Sheharah, belonging to the Imam, in which he spends a certain portion of eachyear. It is the Imam's chief garrison town and training centre, and is said to have a civil population of about 6,000. The valley of the Wadi Dhubawa, the uppermost of the two great left bank tributaries of Wadi Mur, leads into the fertile intramontane district of Hajjah, occupied by the Turks, who have a Kaimakam at the town of that name. It lies due west of 'Amran and therefore does not vitiate the statement made on page 40 that the Turks do not hold effectively any of the highland country north of the latter town. (6) 'Amran itself, which we take as the dividing point of North and South Yemen, is a considerable town lying at a height of some 7,800 feet on the uppermost eastern slope of the Main Ridge, which parts the plateau from the head waters of the Wadis Dhubawa and La/a (the latter valley lies properly in South Yemen). Though it was visited by Glaser, we have no account of the place. It is just outside the Hashid country on the south. South Yemen. Below north latitude 15°, the Yemen improves in fertility. The Tihamah, which is at its broadest in the northern part of South Yemen, is able to support the largest urban centre in the province, Hodeidah, and lesser, but considerable, towns, the two of the name Beit el-Faqih, Zebid, Hais, and Mokhah. The 'Absiyah and the powerful Zaraniq tribe, which hold all this Tihamah, own also several large village settlements. Immediately inland from Hodeidah, the country, rising very gradually some 500 feet, is very lean and sandy; but although a belt along the coast, about ten miles wide on an average, continues to be little better than coralline waste, the steeper inland slope, which begins south of the mouth of Wadi Siham, encloses for some distance a succession of comparatively fertile valleys running westward. The richest valley is that which passes Zebid. South of this, sterility resumes till the projection of the Wasab el-Asfal— 21 — spur from the Maritime Range almost to the coast alters conditions immediately behind Mokhah and causes the latter, though a coast town, to have abundant (though brackish) water and gardens. The well-water along the littoral strip, from end to end, is bad. The urban settlements in the Tihamah are the following : (1) Hodeidah, the most populous Yemen town, is situated on the Red Sea in latitude 14° 47 north. In 1897 the population was estimated at over 50,000 ; but no census has been ever taken. Bury, 1913, estimated it at 42,000, including a British Indian community of about 1,000 and 100 Europeans, mostly Greeks, who have shops. Somalis, Abyssinians, and Arabs from the Hadhramaut are very numerous ; but Arabs from the inland highlands are surprisingly few. Hodeidah has no cjuay or wharfage, nor any of the conveniences of a trading port; the old primitive wooden pier has fallen into decay. There is a small harbour, available only for the smallest craft, with two projecting moles of stone (each bearing a light about fifteen feet high at the end) and a breakwater with two entrances, of which the northern is slightly the easier of access. After the moles were constructed, it was found that the water was not deep enough .to allow loaded lighters to come alongside ; so the stevedores have to wade, and merchandise is dumped on the beach. Large vessels anchor about two and a half miles off in four fathoms; merchandise is transferred in native craft. Landing is difficult, and, at times, impossible, with the wind between south and west. The Ottoman Government conceived a scheme for con structing a harbour for Hodeidah, about ten miles to the north, where there is a deep natural inlet protected by a long spit known as Ras el-Katib. This was part of a larger undertaking known as the Hodeidah-San a Railway. The harbour was to be linked up with Hodeidah by a metre- gauge line along the spit. Construction commenced at Ras el-Katib, and about five miles of track were laid; but no adequate means for landing and handling materialwere provided. The war between Italy and Turkey, and, since then, the European war, have put an end to the scheme for the present, with the net result that what material was not destroyed by the Italian bombardment now lies rusting. Hodeidah has two forts, north and south, both falling into ruin, but conspicuous from seaward. The houses are tall and are usually of stone or brick, almost every one having its characteristic wattle shelter on the flat roof where the inhabitants seek the cool air at night. The town is divided into two quarters by a semi-circular wall which reaches the shore at both ends. The old town, in the space towards the sea, consists of tall stone houses, narrow streets, and covered bazaars ; outside the wall lies a large area of thatched houses, sheds, and compounds. The town in general is dirty, unsanitary, and unhealthy. There is an open market for the exchange of the natural products of the country—coffee, hides, skins—on an expanse of sand outside the town ; whilst the bazaars within the walls are considerable and well stocked with supplies of a general kind. In the immediate vicinity of the town are extensive areas of palm-groves and gardens, but immediately beyond these the surrounding country is extremely sterile. The local water supply is poor ; there are some brackish wells m the neighbourhood, but pure water has to be brought from a distance of some miles. Telegraph lines to (a) San f a, Dhamar, Yerim, Ibb, Ta iz, and Mokhah ; (6) Beit el-Faqih, Zebid, Mokhah, and Perim s an (c) Loheiah and Midi, with a branch to Kamaran Island (not working). is an ancient seat of learning, situated about thirty miles south by east of Hodeidah. The popu ation is about 5,000, but was greater formerlv when the centre of the coffee trade was here. It is garrisoned norma } y a luridsh battalion, designed to overawe the aramq ri esmen, whose contumacious independence has23 it«4 1 tik ruined the town's trade. It was, like Zebid, formerly also a centre of cotton and indigo production and of the weaving and dyeing industries. (There is a village of the same name, distinguished as Beit el-Faqih el-Kebir, about equidistant from Hodeidah on the north, on the Loheiah road.) (3) Zebid, the ancient capital of the lowlands, has always been, and still is, one of the most considerable towns of Yemen. The population was given by Manzoni, in 1880, as 15,000 ; Bury (1913), however, computed it at 8,000, and this latter figure probably is the more correct estimate at the present moment. The town, quadrilateral in form, is surrounded by strong walls, restored in recent times and in good condition. There are four gates ; to north, the Bab es-Siham, leading to Beit el-Faqih ; east, the Bab esh-Shiabariq, to Hais and Ta'iz; south-west, the Bab en-Nekhil; and south, the Bab el-Qurtub. Zebid is still famous for its university and Sunni (Shafe'i) College, which is located in the great mosque ; and there are three other large mosques, besides a number of smaller ones. The bazaar is characterized by Manzoni as the finest in Yemen, and is conspicuously well stocked with local produce of vegetables and fruits, besides imported supplies. Out side the walls are El-Beshi fort and the barracks. The town is on the Hodeidah-Beit el-Faqih-Mokhah telegraph line. In the extensive inland delta-like tract of Wadi Zebid, cotton and indigo are cultivated as special products, but not to the same extent as formerly ; and the weaving and dyeing industries, for which at one time Zebid was famous, have been largely transferred to Hodeidah. Zebid is the administrative centre of the Turkish districts of Wasab el-Asfal and Wasab el-'Ali. The turbulent Zaraniq tribesmen, occupying the district to the north, with the headquarters of one of their chiefs, Mohammed Yahya Fashik, at Huseiniyah, nine miles dis tant, much disturb the communications of Zebid.(4) Hais, 'situated about twenty miles south-east of Zebid, at the junction of two main roads, to Ta f iz and to Ibb, and on the telegraph line from Hodeidah to Mokhah, is a small town much decayed. Population now, probably, not above 2,000. (4) Mokhah, once the chiel centre of the Yemen coffee trade, lies in a small bay between two low points about one and a quarter miles apart, on each of which are the ruins of a fort. Between the forts extends a wall which allows access to the town by one gate, called the Bab esh-Shadli. Opposite this gate, on the sea front, is a stone jetty which is, however, in a state of decay. The town covers about half a square mile of ground, and, in its pros perity, must have had rather an imposing appearance from seaward. The houses are stone-built and were originally large and whitened, but are now mostly in ruins; the only buildings of any importance still standing intact are the mosques, of which some have lofty conspicuous minarets, the highest in the eastern part of the town, 118 feet high, being a good landmark. The streets are very narrow, and in places have become impassable from the debris. Mokhah no longer holds any position as a trading port. In 1824 it contained about 20,000 inhabitants ; in 1882 the inhabitants within the walls had dwindled to 1,500. A floating popu lation, composed of Arabs, Somalis, and Jews, lives in huts outside the walls, and with this reckoned in, the total popu lation within and without will be between 5,000 and 8,000. The country round Mokhah is a sterile plain, without fresh \v ater; good water is brought from Musa by a conduit; brackish water may also be obtained from wells at Beilili and Suweif, five miles to the east. Normally, a small urkish garrison is kept to serve three batteries. On the ^ ® , 0 j 1 ® south port stands a framework iron tower, eet igh, with a flashing light, visible nineteeen miles. Telegraph to (a) San'a, via TViz; (6) Hodeidah, via Zebid; (c) erim, overland to Sheikh Sa'id, and thence by cable (it wnrLnnrA J25 i now, (5) Sheikh Sa'id is important only as a telegraph station situated on the extreme south-westerly point of Arabia, on the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb, opposite the island of Perim, with which latter place it is connected by a short cable. The telegraph station stands on the west side of a small promontory and about three miles from a fort, which latter is situated at the point at which the Anglo-Turkish frontier between the Aden Protectorate and Yemen meets the sea. There are but few houses; and the port consists of an inlet running about two miles inland, fifty yards broad at the mouth, and widening to nearly a mile. There is a good landing-place just south of Cape (Eas) Sheikh Sa'id. Proceeding inland from Hodeidah by the main San ! a highway, the traveller enters the foothills at Bajil, and after J 6bal ascends the Maritime Range itself, through the rich Harraz district, to Menakhah. Both left and right of him stretch other districts not less fertile and elaborately terraced and cultivated. Jebels Milhan north, and Bur a/a andReimah south, of Wadi Siham, are typical Yemen coffee hill-country of the aspect described on pages 14, 34, and long rendered familiar by the descriptions of travellers from Niebuhr onwards. Valleys of verdure, stepped upwards to their heads, hills terraced from base to top and crowned into castellated villages, succeed one another. Jebel Reimah is reckoned the pick of this agricultural hill-country, which thence stretches southwards with fertility diminishing for a while to improve again in the Ta iz district. In this maritime hill-region and the intramontane district behind it there are numerous very large villages, and many chains of hamlets and farms, succeeding one another so closely as almost to rank as one long settlement. But there are only two places of acknowledged town rank, Me nakhah and Ta'iz, (6) Menakhah, 7,500 feet above sea-level, on the Hodeidah-San c a road, is about forty miles crowfly from the latter. In addition to occupying a naturally strongsite, the town is in itself a collection of forts and stone -built fortress-like houses. It stands on a steep ridge formed by an offshoot from Jebel Shibam, and is guarded by a number of outstanding forts and armed posts occupying the heights around, of which the two principal are forts Hadar and Beh (with one or more heavy howitzers), both situated on the south-east, and commanding the town as well as the ap proaches to it. The streets are steep and often lead' over bare and slippery rock. The normal population is about 5,000, including 1,000 Jews. The place would be well able to stand siege, for fertile gardens with good crops overhang the precipices which fall sheer from the town on one side, and orchards and fields of fodder cover the slopes of Jebel Miibam on the other side. The military hospital is at the upper end of the town, and somewhat lower down are the tall oblong barracks and magazine ; the government buildings, and post office, are substantial buildings All these are supplied with a very excellent water laid on to hem by a covered conduit leading from a good spring in a ravme in Jebel Shibam. There are also a number of other perennial springs of good water which adequately supply the town. 1 J in a va l Ie yof considerable fertility aWe i Jebel Sabor, and at an elevation of 4,000 feet ll 1 f he t0 ™. quadrilateral in plan, is sur- n | ^ :t u '' fiom twenty-five to thirty feet in thiek- of l:!^.^ ™ ' hiKh ' cons tracted in the main the exterin 11u ''' 1 a layer of fire-baked bricks on intervak Th tower8 risin S «ght or ten feet at great eastern j® 8 Ve : the Bab el-Kebir, the Ihetkh Mflsn ft. . ng ^ San ' &amp; and Mawiyah ; the Bab towards Tebel ^l K 8 » d Hais ' «&gt;• Bab 'Ain Dnnnnah, Kahrah Th' ? abor V 1 and conn ecting the town with the s b o a xtTi: b0our ^ fortress with barracks which ^onn^nd ^l ^^ft ^ai^'wouldbe very strong except against artillery, were it not itself commanded by the mountains round. The present popu lation probably does not reach 4,000 (Zwemer's estimate is 5,000) ; but formerly Ta f iz was a large city, owing import ance to its situation in the centre of a comparatively fertile district at the junction of several trade routes. Now it is largely ruin. Near the Bab Sheikh Musa is the suq, or market, which is fairly well supplied with fresh vegetables, rice, butter, dates, bananas, lemons, and other fruits. The water is good and plentiful, and is brought by pipes from Jebel Sabor. Of the five main mosques, the principal one, Esh-Sherifiyah, is now closed ; the Muzafferiyah has three big cupolas and several small ones and three rows of columns in a good state of preservation and is the ' cathedral ' of Ta'iz ; the Mukhdebiyah, a large square construction of mixed Byzantine and Arab architecture, is used as a military hospital. Outside the city is the fine and well preserved mosque of Sheikh Afdal. The climate is reputed unhealthy. Telegraph to San'a, Mokhah, and Qa'tabah. The Main Ridge in South Yemen is less down-like and more mountainous in character than in North Yemen. While its crest is bleak and bare, and in places, e.g. about Dhamar, almost of harrah character, the heavy precipitation upon its lofty masses has caused deeper and wider valleys to be eroded on its flanks; its eastward slopes, especially, compare favourably with those of the North Yemen Ridge. Its succession of oases contains, therefore, a chain of con siderable towns from Raudhah in the north to Qa f tabah on the Aden frontier. (8) Raudhah is a small town with large gardens eight miles north of San'a, with which it is connected by a track possible for wheels. It is a grape-growing centre. There was no garrison in 1913. (9) San'a, the old capital of the Imams, the Ottoman capital, and the residence of the Yali of Yemen, lies about 100 miles crow-fly east-north-east of Hodeidah. It is situatedon a broad open plain, 7,600 feet above sea-level. The plain has an almost imperceptible decline towards the north, and is surrounded by low barren hills, of which the highest eminence is Jebel Nuqum, 1,000 feet, the crest of which is surmounted by a Turkish fort and observation post with two big howitzers which command the town. To reach it takes some two hours' journey up a steep winding track. The population is very variously estimated. Harris, in 1891, computed it at 50,000; Manzoni, in 1880, at about 25,000 ; the consular report for 1905 gave it as 20,000, and A\ avell (1910) as 18,000. In any case the chronic commer cial depression and the number of emptv houses (remarked by various authorities) seem to indicate a rapidlv decreasing population. About 6,000 (according to one authority) are Jews. Ihe town is divided into three distinct quarters : the old Arab town proper containing the shops and Government buildings ; the Bir el-'Azab, on the west, a spacious suburb of modern official and private residences and walled gardens; and the Qa at el-\ahud, or Jewish quarter, to the west again. Fhe old town is surrounded by a forty-foot wall of stone and mud flanked with ancieni towers at frequent intPivals, to which the Turks have in more modern times acded defences at the gates, notably the sally-port from the. ci a el, a zigzag outlet of massive strength through which ere is no public admittance. The original town-wall has een extended in modern times to include the two nearer quar eis the whole having a perimeter of seven to eight nu es. here are several outlying fortified posts on the spurs of the surrounding hills which help to guard the city ™ 1 There are ei g ht gates in all.

At the eastern angle of the town is the QaVah (citadel), a considerable pile covering several acres, on a slight but not very commanding elevation. Tn the Arab quarter are situated^ the Government offices, and the Post and Telegraph office. The barracks, handsome stone buildings, lie south of the town, outside the walls ; and near the northernmost outlet of the Bab es-Sabah is situated the well-equipped military hospital. The Midan esh-Sherarah is the city square, having the residence of the Vali in a vast walled garden on one side and the Government school for resident scholars on the other. There are many mosques, both Arab and Turkish, the principal Arab one, built on the site of a church, being of considerable architectural merit, and consisting of a high wall with colonnades on the inner sides; in the middle of the enclosure is a small cubical building known as the Lesser Ka bah, and somewhat resem bling the Ka bah at Mecca. The Turkish mosque is known as the Bakili. The streets in the native quarter are mostly narrow and sombre, owing to the height of the houses. In the Jewish quarter the latter are of mud, not more than two storeys in height and closely packed together. The bazaars of the native quarter are plentifully stocked with local food produce, especially with almost every variety of fruit and vegetables, but otherwise almost entirely with goods of European origin, beside a few objects of native brass and copper work. The Jewish quarter has its own bazaar, and there are some fairly good shops. The water of Saiva is good and plentiful ; a perennial stream runs through the plain, and there are, in addition, [j,,,,,,.., many good wells, both within and without the walls, is tk The purest source, however, is a spring on the lower slopes t |e8o: of Jebel Nuqum. A stream called the Alaf also rises from a spring within the city and flows out under the north wall round Jebel Nuqum, to join eventually the Kharid. Along the course of this, towards the north, is the most extensive tract of irrigated and cultivated land round— 30 — San a, extending to Raudhah. There are other consider able tracts of fertility in the vicinity, and clumps of trees, chiefly tamarisk, give variety to the landscape. In spite of its good water supply and elevated situation, San'a is far from a healthy town, the inhabitants suffering from fevers and a form of anaemia. The heat is never excessive even in summer, and the winter is cold. Manzoni gives the following thermometric observations; November, mean maximum 70°, Fahr., mean minimum 52°; January 62° and 40°; March, 73° and 52°. (10) Dhamar, a large scattered town, is situated in a flat plain, at an altitude of about 8,000 feet above sea-level. It is not walled, as are most of the highland towns, but is more or less defended by a series of small and, for the most part, mud-built forts. There is a look of prosperity about the place, many of the houses beino - commodious and well built of stone, while in the centre of the town there is a wide and rather handsome open square. The government offices are here, and near the square is the principal mosque in a walled enclosure which is entered by three large gates. The population of Dhamar is about 5,000, including the Jews who have a quarter entirely to themselves, separated from the native town by a large open space. The bazaars are notably pictu resque, but contain little in the way of supplies ; there clean W0 PUbllC bat ^ S ' and tlie streetiS are comparatively (11) Yerirn, built partly on level ground and partly on the slope of Jebel Samarah, at an elevation of about / 000 feet above sea-level, is enclosed by strong ri ir. f n gates ' tw( J towards south, one east, and west It has a population of from 3.000 to 4,000 and jltiTmi!

The population is about 4,000, and there is a small garrison. It is on the San'a-Ta'iz telegraph line and has also a direct line of communication with Qa'tabah. (13) Qa'tabah, eighty-one miles north-north-west of Aden, consists of a few stone ddrs and many crowded mud houses. Of the mud town-wall only the south side is standing. A large white mosque and the court house on the east side are the only important buildings. Population is only about 1,500. A stone and mud fort stands half a mile west and has a barrack adjoining. (14) 'Udein lies about fifteen miles west of Ibb, on a direct road to Beit el-Faqih. It is a Turkish merkaz; but we have no information at present about its character or population. Nor are we in a position to say more of the other smaller highland towns, e.g. Doran, Jiblah, Sudah, than appears in Route Reports at the end of this volume.v.— AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIES. The inhabitants of Yemen are in the main settled and in great part occupied in cultivation, and the climatic con ditions which favour the pastoral or Bedouin type do not exist generally, except in parts of the littoral plain and on the eastern plateau. Yemen has ever been noted for its agriculture and general fertility; but this fame is due chiefly to the Highlands not to the Tihamah, which is mostly dusty steppe, except where great wddis cut their way through to the sea. The principal crops of the region as a whole are coffee, maize, red and white millet, bearded wheat and barley, sesame, indigo, and cotton. The distribution of crops,, according to zone, is much as follows :— The Tihamah is, in the main, sterile and saline ; but gardens may be maintained near some of the larger sea ports by constant irrigation, while further inland towards the foothills there are broad arable tracts formed of detritus brought down from the heights. The crops of this belt are red and white millet, maize, sesame, cotton, and indigo (around Beit el-Faqih and Zebid), but neither of the two last in any great quantity. These crops, as a whole, depend on the spring rains and will ripen three months after sowing.. On the inner edge of the Tihamah, where they get the margin of the summer storms, as many as three crops of millet can be obtained from one sowing. Along the hills of the Maritime Range little cultivation is possible (except in those valleys of considerable size wh^te flood-water comes down and can be utilized). The country is well bushed, but there is little soil to cultivate, the surface drainage water is not enough for irrigation purposes, and the population is scanty. The crops, such as they are, are grown in the spring, as the rain falls inthe foothills in April. Millet is the staple, with maize and sesame next in importance, and grass grows plentifully after rain. The Main Ridge, including the Intramontane Uplands (though their soil is not naturally so fertile as in the lowlands and must be artificially renewed from time to time), is the most productive part of Yemen, the rainfall, as shown in a previous section, being more abundant and regular, and the inhabitants, comparatively speaking, more virile, active, and industrious. The staple product is coffee ; then follow bearded wheat and barley, and fodder and garden produce. Coffee as an Arabian crop is peculiar to the Yemen high lands. The plant flourishes at any altitude between 4,000 and 8,000 feet, and is first met between Hodeidah and San c a soon after one leaves Hajjeilah. It is not indigenous to Arabia, but was introduced from Abyssinia during the Ethiopian invasion before the dawn of Islam. The berries used for seed purposes are first placed in the sun to dry until the husk cracks of itself and can be easily opened, care being taken in so doing not to injure the inner skin of the bean. To produce young plants, the -farmer selects a patch of ground free from stones with at least one foot of good soil ; he damps this and smooths it down, presses each bean to a depth of a few inches into the prepared ground, and covers it with a further inch or so of loose fine soil. Artificial shade is then provided, usually of branches, with an aperture at the top so that sunlight may fall for an hour or so daily on each part of the planted surface. The bed is watered every two or three days and the shoots appear in about a month. The seedlings may be planted out about four months after they appear and the plant reaches maturity in five years, attaining a height of from eight to ten feet, and it will be too old to be profitable after about t wenty years. The plantations are laid out in terraces up the hill-sides and follow their curves ; they are faced with stones which sometimes enclose a strip a few feet wideand sometimes an acre or so ; the soil often is only a foot or two deep. Great care has to be taken to prevent the destruction of the terraces by accidental water-courses caused by thunderstorms. Every accessible and suitable spot on the mountain-side is utilized. Many of these terraces were constructed centuries ago, and they give a peculiar and characteristic aspect to the Yemen landscape. The watering is done from cisterns of cemented masonry built in every cleft or ravine where surface-water can be intercepted. Some centres are comparatively sterile and devoid of plantations, since cisterns are not practicable. The harvest is generally in autumn ; but the berries ripen at different intervals, according to their position on the tree and the amount of sun to which a plantation is exposed. The Harraz district produces the coffee of highest quality, and that grown by the Anis and Beni Matar (tribes in the Siham basim) is also well known. Ta'iz is the centre of the southern coffee district. Coffee is still undoubtedly the most important crop of the Yemen, in spite of prices having fallen owing to the competition of Brazil and to the present insecurity and difficulty of transport. Local consumption is enormous, but the thrifty Arabs use (and seem to prefer) the husk, keeping the berry for market. The outlets for the marketable berries are Hodeidah and Aden, but increasingly the latter, because of the compara-. tively greater security of the trade routes. The other main crops of the highlands are barley, bearded wheat, millet, vegetables, and kat. The latter calls for a passing notice. The plant, Katha edulis, resembling the spindle-tree, is cultivated in Yemen over limited areas in such districts as suit it, at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. It is tended with zealous care in walled enclosures, and is perhaps the most profitable of all the Yemen products. The tender leaves^ and twigs are the valuable part of the plant, and are chiefly in demand. The habit of chewing these, for their exhilarating and stimulant properties, is almost universal among the inhabitants of south-west Arabia. The only implements used by the highland farmerare a hoe, a mattock, a reed basket (the latter for tran sporting soil), and an empty kerosene tin for watering purposes. Farther eastward the country becomes less and less fertile, and cultivation gives way almost entirely to pastoral occupations. The farmers in Yemen in general time their operations by the stars. They watch, for example, the movement of Pleiades, which they call Thariyah (from a word meaning wealth) ; and when the cluster swings low in the west they know the spring rains are at hand. Produce has to be transported locally from the farms, by hand or in absurdly small loads on donkeys, because of the extreme difficulty of some of the mountain ravine paths. When the produce reaches a main caravan route, the husband man is faced by exorbitant transport costs, often greatly enhanced by the difficulty of obtaining fodder. The caravan routes, too, are beset by marauders, most often near the coast, where the best, though remotest, markets are. Faced by all these obstacles, production is often restricted to local requirements. Yemen is fertile enough and will produce most generous harvests ; but that it is not self-supporting seems to be shown by the fact that the country imports more than £100,000 worth of foodstuffs even in years of plenty. Most industries are either moribund or languishing from various causes ; but in former days they were not unimpor tant. The following surviving local industries are the only ones worth mentioning :— (1) Dyeing. —The indigo plant is still cultivated round Zebid and Beit el-Faqih ; but the dyeing which was formerly carried on at these places has been dislocated by tribal • disturbances (by the Zaraniq in particular), and has been transferred to Hodeidah, where there was already a small similar industry. There it continues to maintain itself in spite of an increasing tendency to use synthetic dyes.— — (2) Weaving. —There is a colony of weavers at Hodeidah&gt; many of whom have come from the disturbed area just mentioned. They weave a coarse cotton cloth with stripes of colour, and this is retailed in lengths suitable for shawls, etc., as worn by the natives. Ta'iz was once famous for weaving. (3) Tanning. —Hides are dressed and made into sandals- at Hodeidah, Zebid, Beit el-Faqih, and some other centres. Shedpskins are also soft-tanned in some of the larger up- country centres, chiefly for making into boots, which are there worn more often than sandals, because of the cold. (4) Grinding. —There is a small flour-mill at Menakhah, built by the Turks. Elsewhere grinding is done entirely by the hand-quern. (5) Metal-working. —San'a was once famous for its ornamental work in brass and copper; but the industry is now confined to the making of domestic utensils. (6) Production of i¥merak—There is a small amount of coarse brittle native iron, but the scarcity of fuel makes smelting impracticable. Petroleum has long been known to exist in the i arsan Islands, and a concession was granted to an Ottoman subject; but the results of the experimental borings proved of doubtful value. Rock-salt occurs at i on the mainland opposite the Kamaran Islands and the flourishing salt-works there are under the control of the Ottoman Public Debt; the bulk of the salt coes to India, but large quantities are also sent inland Fine stones of onyx, agate chalcedony, and cornelian, are found m the hills round San a.r ers at Hodeial. turbed area just ^ I-—TRADE. Jott with strip r table for stawk Mce-famous for The trade of Yemen has declined in recent years, fot reasons stated elsewhere. The only port of any real com mercial importance is Hodeidah ; but, even there, trade is ie into sandals not so brisk as formerly, or was not, up to the outbreak i other centres, of war. Till then Aden was found a surer outlet for products, tie larger up- largely because the caravan routes leading thither were )ts, which are less liable to tribal disturbances and raids. The conditions 3 of the cold. may, however, be entirely changed now. Nearly all the coffee went to Aden. Mokhah, once the centre of the ,t Menikkh, coffee trade, no longer holds any position as a trading lone entirely port. The other local coasting and fishing villages are: Loheiah, Salif, Ras Katib, Ghuleifakah, El-Jah (a landing place for slaves), Mersa el-Majalis (a good harbour for small, us for to boats), Yakhtul, and Musa. In 1909 the value of imports ae industry at Hodeidah was £650,000, and that of exports £400,000. mils. Before the blockade, the chief articles of export—in fact, the only ones worth considering—were hides, skins, coffee, aall amount and fuller's earth. Coffee, which used to be the mainstay, f fuel makes j s now ousted by hides and skins. For coffee, France was been known the best customer ; then the United States, with Great was panted Britain as a bad third. Hides and skins (the latter largely jxperimental from Asir) went chiefly to New York, Marseilles, and t occurs at London. The imports were cereals, rice, and other food- :an Islands, stuffs from India ; and a long way behind these come the control sheetings, cotton piece-goods, and yarn from the United salt goes to States and Manchester, petroleum from the United States iland. Fine and Russia, iron and steel for smithy purposes from Ger- n, are foimd many, and general stores, silk, and condiments from Italy and Austria. Imports pay, under the Turkish regime, an eleven per cent ad valorem duty, of which eight per cent may be paid in kind with a rebate of ten per cent if cash is paid ; the remaining three per cent must be paid in cash, without rebate. Exports pay one per cent duty, either in cash or in kind.Currency. Currency in Yemen is in a chaotic state. Little infor mation regarding it is available at present, but it appears that both the coins current and their exchange value vary greatly at different times and in different localities. Gold. —The Turkish Lira should be the standard gold coin of the country, but it is rare and becoming rarer. The English Sovereign is readily accepted (=10 Maria Theresa dollars or riydls ; the usual quotation in Turkish piastres is 112 P.T.). The French Napoleon is also in circulation. Silver. —There are two opposition silver standards :— (а) The Maria Theresa dollar, or riydl ( = 12 piastres). (б) The Turkish Mejidieh dollar (=17 piastres). The latter used to be the only legal tender in silver, and the importation of the Maria Theresa dollar was prohibited for some time ; but the prohibition was withdrawn in 1910. The Mejidieh dollar will only be accepted by the Arabs of the towns, and even there the riydl is accepted more readily. The smaller silver coins in use are 5-piastre and 2-piastre pieces. The 1-piastre is a nickel coin=4 hildl (copper). The merchants of Hodeidah make general use of Indian rupees as currency and base their exchange calculations on the value of 100 riydls in that currency, the rate of exchange being guided by the rate at Aden/ Weights and Measures. The weights in common use are ;— 1 Okeh—11 kilogrammes. 8 ,, =1 faras. 45 „ =1 qantar. 300 ,, =1 bukhar (for coffee only). The linear measure is :— Dra t a=65 csntimetres.VII.—POLITICAL. Government. The Government of Yemen is multiplex and variable. In the Tihamah it is in the hands of the Turks, except in the territories of certain rebellious tribes, of which the Zaraniq, occupying a belt from the coast to the hills south of Hodei- dah, are 0 the most important. In the Maritime Range authority is about equally divided between the Turks and the Imam, the former prevailing where, as in Hajur, they have fairly open country to deal with and posts like Qufl can command a wide radius; or again where anti-Zeidist tribes are established, as about Menakhah. Of the Highlands (third to fifth zones), the southern part, from about 'Amran, is under a condominium, the Turks having the supreme military and administrative control, but the Imam retaining legal powers, religious and civil [see Icitev), which amount^to a social jurisdiction; he has also the private allegiance of the principal tribes, e.g. the southern Hamdan and^Khaulan, and the Anis. In the northern part, from 'Amran up to the Asir border, the Imam's is the only power ; but it is impaired by the exacting independence of certain great tribes, especially the Hashid wa Bekil, by the permanent detachment of the heretical Yam, and by the influence of Idrisi of Asir on border clans. On the eastern plateau no law runs but that of the local chiefs of the Jauf (Dhu Husein), and other oases, the Yam controlling Nejran. The Turks, who first established themselves in Yemen early in the sixteenth century, lost their hold on the high lands a hundred years later; and these, falling into the hands of the Zeidi Imams of Sa'dah, who had previously been supreme in the north only, remained independent till well on into the latter half of the nineteenth century. Nor did the Tihamah remain in Turkish power much longer, and throughout the eighteenth century was ruled in the— 40 — main by its own local sheikhs, under a vague suzerainty exercized by the Imams of San'a, and hardly effective except in Mokhah. But in 1819, Mohammed 'Ali of Egypt occupied the coast towns, and prepared the way for the resumption of direct Turkish rule. The Egyptians with drew in 1840, and, at last, to counteract the efforts of Sherif Husein of Abu f Arish in South Asir to dominate the Tihamah, a Turkish expeditionary force re-appeared in Yemen in 1849, took Hodeidah and other parts of the Tihamah from Sherif Husein, and advanced on to the high lands. But though it entered, it was unable to retain San'a, where the Imams were still strong despite the treacherous conduct of the latest of the dynasty; and it was not till 1872, when his successors had displayed their incompetence for nearly a quarter of a century longer, that the Turks established themselves in the central highlands on an invitation from the notables of the capital itself. The titular Imams relapsed into subsidized obscurity. 4 he Tihamah and the central and southern highlands, inclusive of Asir, were consti tuted a Vilayet, which nominally extended northwards to the Hejaz border ; but the only part of the highlands north of Amran which was effectively held or really adminis tered by the Turks was the central district and coast line of Asir,^ all the intervening highland region, about Khamir and Sa'dah, remaining independent and without Ottoman administrative posts. Turkish efforts to hold the oases of the eastern plateau resulted in no permanent occupation • nor were their intermittent attempts to extend their rule southwards into the Aden hinterland, as certain Imams had done before them, more successful. The head centre of Ottoman government was San^a, where the Vali and the v 111 ( ; Y rl' 1 U ! K ! er 11 were fou1 ' Sanjaks, the Merkaz (\ e me n) Asir, Hodeidah, and IViz, governed bv Mutessarifs. Ot these the three in Yemen proper were divided into tT^ 0l S iah ' Ha ^ r (Q llfl )' Zeidiyah, Bajil, 7ebM • S k 5 ?r a] - J ' ah ' Tawilah ' D oran, Reimah, Eadk V^ 11 ' a Hajjah. Anis, Dhamar, Kacla a, \erim, and Qa'tabah.— 41 — Never long quiet under alien rule, impatient of taxation, and disgusted at the spectacle of lands falling out of cultivation and trade passing to Aden, the Yemenis, especi ally the highlanders, gave continual trouble to the Turks. In 1891, a great rising (the first of a series) took place, but was suppressed after a costly campaign, and San'a was wrested from the rebels by Ahmed Feizi Pasha. Yahya Hamid ed-Din (a descendant of the Rassite House, but not of any recent Imam), in whose name the revolt had been proclaimed, fled on its actual outbreak to Sa'dah, leaving the headship of the actual fighting forces to his cousin, Ahmed esh-Sherai. Another general rising followed in 1904 on the death of the son of Yahya Hamid ed-Din, viz. Moham med el-Mansur, Who had been recognized outside Turkish jurisdiction as Imam. The latter's son, Yahya, succeeding to the Imamate, marched south. San'a capitulated through famine, and all the posts inland of Menakhah surrendered to the rebels, who took more than seventy pieces of artillery and a considerable quantity of small arms and ammunition. Ahmed Feizi Pasha, who had shown such firmness and ability in the previous rising, posted overland from Basra to take command of an expeditionary column which had been collected on the coast, and eventually fought his way up to San 5 a and re-established order, but only after a great expenditure of blood and money. The Imam utterly refused to surrender any of the weapons and stores he had captured, and it was only on the Turks giving way on this point that a patched-up peace was made. In 1911, San'a (under Mohammed ? Ali Pasha) was again beleaguered by the insurgent tribes in the name of the Imam Yahya. 'Izzet Pasha, who relieved the place and became military governor, proceeded to inaugurate a rapproche ment with the Imam ; for he saw that the military diffi culties of the situation (especially in view of hostile Italian action against the coast) demanded some such policy, if Turkey was to preserve even nominal sovereignty in Yemen. At first the Porte refused even to consider such a policy, and 'Izzet had to go himself to Stambul in order to press hisviews, leaving Mahmud Nazim Bey (a civilian) to carry on the negociations with the Imam, and administer the Vilayet. 'Izzet Pasha, however, obtained his desire at Stambul, and on September 22, 1913, an Imperial Firman was read publicly at San'a, proclaiming a mediatized status, or entente with,^ the Imam ' for the sake of peace among Mos lems. The term of this firman established that civil and criminal law should be based no longer on the Turkish judi cial code {Qanun) but on the old Islamic code or Sheria, which should be administered by nominees of the Imam. J he latter was to draw from the provincial Treasury a substantial annual subsidy for himself and his vassal chiefs (L.T. 1,000 per mensem for his own Civil List and L.T. 1,500, in addition, for his vassals). Under this entente the Imam has the religious and social control in the Kazas of Hajur, Tawilah (Kaukeban), Doran, Hajjah, Yerim, and Ibb , and he appoints and removes judges and magistrates, subject to the veto of the Ottoman authority. Zeidi districts pay no tithe, and no one is liable to punishment for past acts of rebellion under the Imam's flag. Octroi and transit duties were abolished. Actually, the only taxes since levied (and these only when opposition has not been too great) are {a) the tithes {hishur, in non-Zeidi districts) on agricultural produce and stock, and (6) market dues (ten per cent on all produce sold, one Turkish piastre for every goat slaughtered and ten Turkish piastres for every bullock), an (c) customs dues.^ Tribesmen, under the Imam, are exempt rom all taxation, but give military service instead, n called upon. Imamate dates back to the establishment of the Shi ah Rassite dynasty of A lids at Sa'dah in the early tenth century ; but it only became more than a very local power under the Imam Qasim in the seventeenth century. It has great prestige m Yemen ; but the faith of the people hoklprf 11 ' mdermi 'f d h y the incompetence and venality of holders of the office, and especially by the treacherous— 43 — s, orf though abortive betrayal of San 5 a to the Turks in 1849 by the Imam Mohammed Yahya. The direct influence of the Imams is confined almost entirely to the Zeidist districts of Yemen. On the coast and in the highlands of the Aden hinterland, where the population is predominantly Sunnite of the Shafe'i school, it goes for little or nothing. The office is elective, like the Ibadhi Imamate in Oman ; but, in practice, a son of the last Imam is usually, and a scion of the original Rassite stock is invariably, preferred. In recent elections there has been a good deal of intrigue and substitu tion of one house for another. The Qasim family of Sheha- rah is at present in power ; but other houses, e.g. the Hadi Lidin Allah and the Shehari, hold themselves equally entitled to it. Once elected, the Imam becomes essentially a sacred personage, and for some generations back, the holder of the title has lived more or less in seclusion, a mysterious being, little seen by the people, though, behind the veil, more than one Imam has been notoriously addicted to very secular vices. To this Shiite conception of their office the Imams owe it that they have never obtained the dominant position among Moslems, accorded to the Alids of Mecca. Recent Politics. Yahya Hamid ed-Din el-Mutawakkil Ibn Mohammed el-Mansur Ibn Yahya Hamid ed-Din, who has been ruling Imam since 1904, is now (1916) about forty years of age. He is a short thick set man of fair complexion. When he accepted ijvice instw a mediatized status in 1913, and Khamir became the Imamite capital, he took up his residence in the fortress of Sheharah, north-east of that town, and admitted Turkish garrisons both stablisli®® 1 there and at Khamir. Having become friendly with Mahmud i in the earl, 1 Nazim Pasha after c Izzet Pasha's departure, he became anti- Turk after the latter's supersession, and disapproved of the attack on Aden in 1915, as an infringement of his prero gative. But on Mahmud's re-instatement late in 1915, he returned to allegiance. On the whole, however, he may be safely said to be hostile to Ottoman military rule in Yemen.# ft — 41 — Though bound by his position to administer the Sheri'a and maintain a religious character, Yahya is more lax m observance than his father, and lives less in religious seclusion. He appears to take no very active part in^ov- ernment, beyond receiving reports from his nominees and adherents and is said to be an intelligent man of shifty haT Tinf 11 ^ n ? 1 C ^ iaracter ' W ^ 0 ' ow i n g to his parsimony, has not much hold oyer the tribesmen of the north-east. He greatly weakened his position by releasing, in accord- ance with the terms of the peace of 1911, 400 hostages kept and not ' T l ^ . He is 8tr0n ^ 0 PP 08ed c d not very likely either to head another revolt or to enter into relations with Great Britain; but he could on occasmn, marshal and arm a large force, and he has ^uns and munitions.

Since then he has kept fairly quiet witThWlf W'nV the Sherif int0 an active alliance W i/ T S , into one with Id risi, though he has kept more or less faithfully, his truce with the Tatter since the late autumn of 1915. His chief activity has been to send emissaries and troops into the north-east Men hinterland (spring 1916) to win over the tribes of the Beda . ulaqi districts to his suzerainty and to tamper with those of Hadhramaut.

During the Turko-Italian war Ibn el-Heij wavered in his allegiance and took money from the Italians; but m the past two years he has been most active on the Turkish side. In September 1915 he raided the Beni 'Abs and was wounded. Idrisi retaliated by cutting off his supplies, and Ibn el-Heij, finding himself short of food, and his followers beginning to desert, appealed to the Imam for help. The latter sent the discouraging reply that he would send troops if they were fed. T he \\ a azat are reported to number between 1 500 to 3,000 fighting men. Sheikh ( Ali Ibrahim is the most important Sheikh after Ibn el-Heij. 2.—Jami'. A Shafe'i tribe living just north of Loheiah and east as far as Zahirah, which is their chief village. In 1911 thev ought the Turks on behalf of Idrisi, but they are now close allies of [bn el-Heij of the Wa 'azat. The chief Sheiffli is Mohammed Zeid, who comes from the Ashraf of Sabiyah tt M ; idl ; Zahirah.

A small tribe east of Kamaran settled south of the Beni Qeis between Zeidiyah and the hills. Chief Sheikh: 'Ali Saghir. They number about 250 fighting men. 5.—Zaliyah. A small tribe living immediately to the south of Loheiah and the Wadi Mur down to the Beni Suleil. They are independent of the Wa'azat, their northern neighbours. Sheikh Hadi f Ali, living at Dar el-Muhannab, is their chief Sheikh. They number 400 men. 6.—Suleil, Beni. The Beni Suleil occupy a large area from the coast opposite Kamaran to the foot of the hills below Jebel Milhan. On the north they border on the Bu'ajah, Za'liyah, and Beni Qeis ; on the east are the Beni Qeis, and on the south the Hashabiri, who are perhaps really only one of their sections. The main road which runs north and south through the Tihamah near the foot of the hills passes through their country, as well as that of those tribes already mentioned ; and they and the Beni Qeis control the caravan trade going up to the Wadi Mur. Estimates of their numbers vary from 1,500 to 10,000 fighting men. The western part of their territory is desert, but they have a good deal of arable land under the foothills in the east. The tribe supports the Turks, and their chief Sheikh, 'Abdullah Kauzi, has received the title of Pasha and been appointed Mudir of Kenawuz. They are friendly with the Wa'azat, but independent of them. Towards the Quhrah they are always hostile. Their chief villages are : Zeidiyah (Sheikh c Ali Nukar), Kenawuz, Ibn 'Abbas, and Salif on the coast. There are important salt works at the latter, and a jetty, where sea-going ships come alongside.7.—Manari. The mercantile tribe of the district between Loheiah and Hodeidah ; peace-loving and settled. Their chief village is Munirah ; Seyyid Mohammed en-Nihah is their principal Sheikh. They come under 'Abdullah Pasha Boni, and possibly are a section of the Beni Suleil. 8.—Hashabiri. A small Sunni tribe living a few miles south of the Turkish post of Zeidiyah east of the Kamaran Islands, and coming under the jurisdiction of 'Abdullah Pasha Boni. To their south is the Quhrah tribe. They number between 250 to 300 fighting men. Their chief Sheikhs are Isma'il 'Ah and Abdullah Mash-hur. Their chief villages are Qariyah, Dar el-Bahri, and Mahal. 9.—Jarabih. A small tribe of about 1,000 men settled in Wadi Sirdud, whose chief village is Dhahi (Sheikh Yahya 'Izzan). They number about 400 fighting men and their chief Sheikh is Hasan Ahmed Es-Sulh. They are under the jurisdiction of the Kaimakam of Bajil. Their fighting reputation is good and they are hostile to the Beni Suleil and Quhrah, their northern and southern neighbours. 10.—Quhrah. An important tribe on the first stages of the Hodeidah- k an a road, extending from the sea for about fifty miles north-east to Hajjeilah. Their neighbours on the north are the Jarabih, on the east the tribes of Jebel Harraz and Jebel Bura'a, and on the south the Absiyah. Between the coast and Bajil,a distance of twenty-five miles, the country is mostly desert, and the inhabitants live in temporary huts in the Khabt; east of Bajil there is cultivation. The Quhrah own large numbers of camels, and the caravan transport between Hodeidah and Hajjeilah is mainly in their hands. They can put from 3,000 to 4,000 men in the field and gave valuable assistance to the Turks in 1911, when the former occupied the Lahab heights. They are generally at feud with the Beni Suleil. The chief Sheikh is Mu'afah Sheraf. Others are Hasan 'Abdullah and Ibrahim ; Ali. Chief villages are Bajil (Sheikh c Ayad Ibn f Ali Humeidah), Buhah, 'Obal, and Hajjeilah (Seyyid Husein 'Ali). 11.— ? Absi or Absiyah. The f Absi or 'Absiyah extend from the coast south of Hodeidah to the foot of Jebel Bura'a, about,thirty miles from west to east and about fifteen miles from north to south. The eastern half of their country is fertilized by the Wadi Siham, one of the principal wddis of Yemen, which rises within a few miles of San a, and by the southern part of the Wadi Ghadir, rising in Jebel Reimah. Their numbers are estimated at 5,000 to 6,000 men. ihey are divided into the following sections : the Rabasah, round Hodeidah; the Munafirah, east of them; the Hawwak, round Mandar on the coast ten miles south of Hodeidah ; the Beni Salih, under Jebel Bura/a ; the Ahl el-Khalifah and Ahl esh-Sha'rah, east of Marawah, Dar ed-D6m; and the Ahl es-Sabt el-Haradah, near Jebel Bura'a. The principal Sheikh is Suleiman Hasan of Mahad. There are impor tant settlements of Seyyids at Marawah and at Mansuriyah. Principal villages are: 'Asal (Sheikh Yahya Harisah, of Rabasah); Mahad (Sheikh Suleiman Hasan); Mukaiminiyah (Sheikh Yusuf 'Ali, of Munafirah); Mandar (Sheikh 'Ali Wahhaban, of Hawwak); Khalifah (Sheikh Mohammed 'Atiyah); Shar'ah (Sheikh Mohammed Suleiman); Kadubah;Marawali (Seyyid 5 Abd el-Bari); Mansuriyah (Sherif Ahmed Yahya Balir and Mohammed Haidar); Quti' (Sherif Moham med Hamud); Ghanamiyah. Sherif Ahmed Yahya Bahr has great influence over all the Tihamah north and south of Hodeidah, and is looked on by the Beni Suleil, Quhrah, 'Absiyah, and Zaraniq, as their religious leader. 12.—Zaraniq. A powerful and warlike tribe, divided into two sections, the Zaraniq esh-Sham and Zaraniq el-Yemen, and occupying the country between the sea and the hills from a few miles north of Beit el-Faqih almost to Zebid. The Zaraniq have long been a thorn in the side of the Turks, and were particularly troublesome during the Turco-Italian war. Repeated expeditions have failed to subdue them, but latterly there have been reports that the highland section, under Sheikh ? Ali Ibn Hamud, has succumbed to Turkish bribes. Mohammed Yahya Fashik, the chief of the lowland section and paramount over the whole tribe, living at IIus- einiyah, nine miles north of Zebid, has, however, continued to hold out stoutly. In November 1915 he made common cause with Idrisi by taking active measures against the Turks, and has succeeded in effectually cutting all com munications in the Tihamah from north to south. At the beginning of 1916 he was attacked by an irregular force from Mokhah, increased by 300 Arabs under the leadership of Abela Effendi, the brother of Elias ^Osman, Kaimakam of Mokhah, but unsuccessfully. In May 1916 he again took the offensive and looted the Turkish Serai in Beit ol-Faqih. 1 he two most important Sheikhs, after Sheikh -Fashik, and closely allied with him, are Esh-Shami and Munasar Saghir. Other Sheikhs, of whom nothing is known save their names, are 'Abdullah Munasar, of Huseiniyah; Nasir Jurmush; Ismail Ahmed, Sheikh of Qaramshah; 'Abdullah Duneidinah, of Zebid; Ahmed Risqallah, of A1— 53 — © 'Ali; Hasan Rish, of El-Jiz; Samud, of A1 Musa; Hasan Mubarak, of Um Fa'za 5 ; and Ibrahim Dhumbi, of Doreihimi. Ta'if, on the Khor Ghulaifikah, is their chief port. They own many sea-going dhows, and have much of the trade be tween Aden and the important towns of Zebid and Beit el-Faqih in their hands. Formerly Khor Ghuleifakah was the chief port of the Yemen coffee trade ; but it has silted up, and been superseded first by Mokhah, and more recently by Hodeidah. Jahbah, a clan of the northern section, occupies the north west corner from Shurain to Doreihimi, and the Mujamilah are at Jebel Kahmah in the north. The Wadi Reimah, which rises in Jebel Doran, runs through the Zaraniq country and irrigates a large area of fertile land, The chief town is Beit el-Faqih {see p. 22). The principal villages are Ta'if (Sheikh Munasar Saghir); Shurain, (Jahbah, 'Abasi Jahbah); Doreihimi (Jahbah and Sa'dah); El-Kahmah (Mujamilah); Mohammed Jabir, Lawiyah (Jahbah); El-Huseiniyah (Mohammed Yahya Fashik); El-Mahad. The Zaraniq are estimated at 20,000 men, two-thirds of whom belong to the Yemeniyah or southern division. / 13.—Kokhah. A tribe near Mokhah, which fired on a ship's cutter of H.M.S. 'Lama' and killed two men late in 1915. The Sheikh was made prisoner but disavowed complicity, and after being takfen to Aden was released. Commerce between Aden and the Kokhah was forbidden. The Sheikh is a figurehead and powerless, but inimical to the Turks.rrf — 51 — II.—INLAND (NORTH). H ajur. 14.—Aflah.

Formerly they were counted as in the Turkish Merkaz of Qufl. but, after the treaty of 1911 between the Turks and the Imam, they came under thfi jurisdiction of the latter. They are Zeidis, good fighters, and allied with the neigh bouring Zeidi tribes of Beni Jill and Beni 'Aziz. 22.— 'Aziz, Beni. A small Zeidi tribe of Hajur el-Yemen living at Hubur Meili just to the south of the Beni Zafer and Beni Jill, with whom they are allies. They were formerly under the Turkish Merkaz of Qufl, but came under the Imam by the treaty of 1911. They have a good fighting reputation and are noted for their cultivation of fruits, coffee, and kaf. 23.—Jemeimah. A small Zeidi tribe, living round Jebel Jemeimah about fifteen miles east of Qufl in Hajur. They are outside Turkish jurisdiction and are ruled by the Imam's nominee, Seyyid Ahmed Ibn el-Qasim. Their chief Sheikh is Ali Ibn Nasir. 24.—Mesruh. A small Zeidi tribe under the Imam, just to the south of the Khamsin, in the mountains about thirty miles east of Midi.Highlands. 25.—Juma'a, Beni. A powerful and independent Zeidi tribe, partly nomad but^ chiefly settled, living in the country north-east of Abu Arish almost to Jebel Razah. Eight years ago the im portant Sheikh, Seyyid Ahmed ed-Dahiani, at that time Emir of Sa'dah and district, quarrelled with the Imam and fled to the Beni Juma/a for protection. Since then he has lived with them and established a firm place for himself amongst them. He is a great friend of Idrisi, whom the Beni Juma/a also support. 26.—Razah, Ahl. A Zeidi tribe living round Jebel Razah to the west of the Khaumn esh-Sham and Sa'dah. They are supporters ox idnsi, and their country was the scene of the first fighting between Idrisi and the Imam in 1912.

The Imam owns a fortress at their chief village, Saqein. from which his representative and one of his chief military leaders, Seyyid Qasim Seifi, governs the tribes of the district. Here also lives the paramount chief. Sheikh Juma'an Ibn Safiq. Their country is said to contain gold deposits and is rich in wheat and coffee ; a large quantity of the latter is exported into Asir through Dahran. Chief divisions: Beni Quteim (Sheikh el-Ja 'afari) ; AI Thureim (Sheikh El-Hajj); Beni Kumamah (Sheikh Abu Qutabab); Beni Junia'a (Sheikh Juma'an Ibn Safiq); Al Fudhah and Beni Qobab (Sheikh ^Abdel-'Aziz Ibn Fudhah); Beni Hashim (Sheikh 'Abdullah ^Adham); and 'Anazah (Sheikh Dab wan). Chief villages ; Saqein, Tawilah, and Shibah. 28.—Murran, Beni. The Beni Murran inhabit the rich coffee producing country round Jebel Murran, which lies a few miles to the west of Sa'dah. Their chief village is Tawilah, situated on the slopes of Jebel Murran. The tribe, which is reported to be a strong one, supports the Imam and fought for him against Idrisi in 1911. Hizam Ibn Qaid et-Tawafi is the paramount chief. The Imam's representative is Seyyid Qasim Ibn Yahya. The chief divisions are the Beni Sa'd, Beni Dheiba'i, El-Hawazim, El-Hijrah, and El-Hadahidah. 29.—Hamdan esh-Sham. A large Zeidi tribe almost entirely Bedouin and roaming over the country which lies a day and a half to the north east of Sa'dah. They are bounded on the north by the Yam tribes of Nejran, east by the Bekil, west by Bedouintribes, and south by Bekil nomads. At present they are on had terms with the Imam, They are quite independent and will fight for any one who pays them. Their chief Sheikh is Sherif Salih Ibn c Ali. They are of the same stock as the Hamdan el-Yemen (No. 61), but are too far off to be in touch. 30.—Yam. The \ am tribes form a powerful confederation, stretching from the northern boundary of the Bekil in Barat up Wadi Nejran and Wadi Habunah far to the north in the direction of Tathlith and Wadi Dawasir. Joseph Halevy, the only European who has visited their country, found it in 1870 a fertile and productive region inhabited^ by a well-to-do population. In religion they are Isma'iliyah and are known to the rest of Yemen as the Mutazeilah or isolated sect; but, since Wadi Nejran was the last refuge of Christianity and has remained far removed from external influence, it is possible that the Isnia ih creed contains traces of the ancient worship, Halevy was not long enough in the country to verify this suppos^ion, but the tolerance and even favour which he found extended to the Jews in Makhlaf were hardly in the spirit of strict Mohammedanism. The religious chiefs are probably more orthodox than the bulk of the inhabitants, since they are m communication not only with the chief he^d' 8, 0 f&gt;men , but with the Agha Khan, their spiritual The ruling family is that of Makrami, descended from a famous ancestor who, in the middle of the eighteenth century, preached his reforming Gospel from Nejran toHasa. About the middle of the nineteenth century they developed meas of expansion, and in I860 obtained from the Imam TW + Emirate of Heimah, Harraz, and Menakhah. ho y i ever ' was ^ort lived, for, in 1872, they re defeated and banished to their own country by Mukhtar— 59 — mdepeDieitf- i same steh Pasha. There is still a small remnant of the tribe, calling themselves the Makarimah, in the Harraz district {see No. 50). The present Emir of Nejran is Isma/il el-Makrami. He owes no allegiance, but his tribesmen are as a rule willing to serve as mercenaries with either Imam or Turk, if well paid. They have a reputation for ruthless bravery. Idrisi has been in negotiation with them at various times during the present war with a view to forcing the Imam's hand against the Turks, but nothing has resulted up to the present. 31.—Sahar. The Sahar are a fairly numerous tribe, of w T hich the settled portion lives in and round the town of Sa'dah and is engaged in agriculture and trading. Owing to internal disunion and absence of tribal feeling, it does not possess the political importance which its numbers should secure to it. The villagers are all under the authority of the Imam, but the nomads are almost completely independent and are accus tomed to range far afield to the north and east in the direc tion of Nejran and Barat. As a rule the tribe keeps on good terms with its neighbours, the Hashid and the Arabs of Khaulan esh-Sham. 'Ali Ma'awad is the chief Sheikh of the settled portion. Seyyid Ahmed and Qasim el-Hashimi are the representa tives of the Imam. Settled portion. —Chief clans ; Beni Hazim (Sheikh Tabran Muqbil) ; Beni Sa'ad (Sheikh Taheir) ; Beni Hamdan and Ahl Nuqeim (Sheikh Hamdan el-Jirbi); Beni Dhufeir (Sheikh 'Abdullah Dahmi); Beni Sineidar (Sheikh Ahmed Sineidar) ; Beni Huran and Beni 'Umarah (Seyyid el-Qasim) ; Beni Jurman (Ahmed el-Hashimi) ; Beni juma'a (Sheikh Dah- mash).

In the south they go down the AVadi ' Amashiyah to the country of the Hashid, with whom they are on good terms. They are excellent fighters and firm adherents of the Imam, whose representative at Sa'dah is Mohammed Abu Nuweibah. The Al ? Ammar are allied with the Sahar and generally at feud with the Al Damaj.

Their chief Sheikh is Sa'ad Ibn Sa'ad ; the chief Seyyids in their country are Seyyid f Ali ed-Damaji and Seyyid Husein Merza/a. Chief clans are Al Wadi (Sheikh 'Abdullah). Al 'Utuf, and Al Awadah (Sheikh Qahtan Damaji). Hashid wa Bekil. ft is not clearly established whether the Hashid wa Bekil are a of the same descent and therefore one tribe, or whether t ey are a confederation of two tribes of differing origin. Availabfe evidence seems to show that the Hashid trace their descent back to Himyar, and the Bekil to Qahtan; but whatever may be the truth of this, there is no doubt- 61 11 ') that their names are commonly linked together by natives in the Yemen, that they are on terms of close friendship and have been so for many generations, and that together they form one of the most powerful tribal bodies in Southern Arabia. The home country of the Bekil is to the east in Marashi and Barat, but, as will be seen from the description given below, there are also tribal units living in the midst of the Hashid country, and even so far south and west as Hajjah, Wadi Shiris, and Mahweit. The Hashid occupy the country roughly from a few miles north of Amran almost to Sa'dah and to the west extend almost to Hajur. To the east they are settled in Bilad el-Kharf and round Dhibm; but their nomads wander far afield to the north and towards Barat and Jauf. For many generations the fortunes of the Hashid wa Bekil have been intimately connected with those of the Imams of Yemen, and such must always -be the case, both on account of common tenets and because some^ of ^the chief strongholds of the Imam, e.g. Sheharah, Qafilat 'Udhr, and Madan, are set in the midst of the Hashid country. The Imams drew largely on the confederation for their fighting material, and in return rewarded its chief men by governorships in different parts of the country. Thus before the Ottoman conquest, the chief family of the Himran section of the Hashid ruled all the count n from Nejran to Wadi La/a and Kaukeban, and the head of the Wada/a governed Mekhadir just south of Jiblah. The leading Bekil Sheikhs were equally powerful and the family of Awsat held the overlordship of Ibb, Suhul, Udein, Nadrah, and Ta iz, while the family of Sha if were Emirs of Hajjah and Zufeir. The conquest of the Yemen by Mukhtar Pasha in 1^72, and the consequent restriction of the power of these Sheikhs, left them with a strong hatred of the Turks and a lasting desire to regain their lost territories ; and they have alwaj s taken a leading part in the many revolts against Otto man authority during the last forty years. They bitterly— 62 — resented the declaration of peace in 1911 and the Imam's treachery towards the Idrisi; and his proposition that they should pay taxes to the Turks caused Nasir Ibn Mabkhut, the chief of the Himran and paramount Sheikh of the Hashid, to withdraw his tribes and enter into relations with Idrisi. A truce was arranged in the following year, but there is still bad feeling between the two which is not likely to cease until the Imam declares definitely against the Turks. The defection of so powerful a body of sup porters has of course reacted in favour of Idrisi who during the last few years has been steadily working to make the feeling permanent. He has, however, to contend against an allegiance which has been handed down for many genera tions, and his lack of ready cash has prevented him from doing more than keep relations between the Imam and the Hashid strained. He has been in constant touch with their chief Sheikhs for the last few years, and has said that money is the only thing required to bring them on his side. The outstanding figure of the Hashid wa Bekil confe deration is Nasir Ibn Mabkhut. This Sheikh, a man of forcible and ruthless character, has gained almost complete ascendency over the Hashid tribesmen and largely influences the Bekil chiefs. He is cruel and unscrupulous and will join whichever side pays him most. His power is such that given adequate material help he can in all probability force the Imam to what terms he likes. No attempt has been made to estimate numbers in the account which follows, but the confederation is said to have put over 50,000 men in the field against the Turks in 1911. 34.—Hashid. The boundaries of the Hashid have already been de scribed. The tribe is largely an agricultural and pastoral one, but certain sections, especially the Himran, are engaged in trade.The most important sub-tribes are the Himran, Dhu 'Udhrah, and Dhu Fari', and most of the tribal policy seems to be guided by Sheikhs Salih Ibn Muslih, Salih Ma'id, Mas'ud el-Barak, and Dirhem Ibn Yahya, under the direc tion of Sheikh Nasir Ibn Mabkhut. The only sections which have stood out against them and solidly supported the Imam are the Ahnum, A1 Ahim, Zuleimah, and the southernmost tribes, the Beni Surih and Arhab. The country of the Hashid is by no means uniformly fertile, and in consequence there are many nomad sections. Theoretically taxes are payable to the Imam, but of late years they have mostly found their way into the coffers of Nasir Ibn Mabkhut. The Seyyids are very powerful in the Hashid country, Huth being their most important centre in the Yemen after San'a and Sa'dah. They are with the Imam or against him according to the favours • they receive from him. His meanness and parsimony seem to have sent the majority into Nasir Ibn Mabkhut's camp. The sub-tribes which follow are placed in the order of what is believed to be their numerical and political importance, irrespective of their geographical position. I.—Himran. Chief Sheikhs ; Nasir Ibn Mabkhut and Salih Ibn Muslih, his nephew and most important lieutenant. His chief strongholds are at Hamri, Habur, and Dhofir. Range :— (a) The majority live in villages between Khamir and Huth. (h) There are several small sections in Wadi La a and Hajjah. The Himran traders travel over most of the Yemen. There are many of them in San'a and Hodeidah.69 35.—Bekil. The Bekil are mainly settled in the oases of Barat, Ruhub, -and Khabb, which lie some days to the north-east of the Hashid territory, and they are engaged chiefly in the rais ing of horses and sheep. The most powerful tribe both in numbers and in military prowess is the Dhu Moham med, whose Sheikhs have nearly all followed the fortunes of Nasir Ibn Mabkhut. The Bekil tribesmen do not find their home country sufficient for all their needs and many have emigrated to Jauf and different parts of the Hashid country. Thus whole tribes are found in the latter, such as the Beni Malik, near Sheharah, and the Beni Jabr round Sudah, while there are still, in Hajjah, Wadi Shiris, and Mahweit, survivors from the old days when the Bekil Sheikhs were all powerful in those districts. The Bekil and Hashid Sheikhs are on terms of close friendship with the Dhu Husein of Jauf, so much so that the latter are sometimes spoken of as a part of the Bekil. But there is no doubt that the Dhu Husein are descended from the Ashraf (Sherifs) and they are therefore dealt with separately. The chief Sheikhs of Bekil are: Abdullah Ibn Ghazeilan, Yahya Ibn Yahya esh-Sha'if, Naji' Ibn Yahya, and Abu Harbah. No personal details are known about them except that they rose with Nasir Ibn Mabkhut, in 1911, against the Imam, and have followed his fortunes ever since. The influence of the Seyyids of Huth is almost as strong amongst the Bekil as amongst the Hashid. The Emir, Seyyid Ibrahim Muhsin er-Rusas of Huth, is also chief Hakim Shera/i and he has agents all over their country collecting tithes. The chief Bekil tribes are as follows ;— I.—Dhu Mohammed. Chief Sheikhs; 'Abdullah Ibn Ghazeilan, of Dhu Ghazeilan; Yahya Ibn Yahya Sha/if, of Esh-Sha if; Naji Ibn Yahya, of A1 Awsat; Abu Harbah.— 71 — V.—Beni Malik. Chief Sheikhs ; Ibn 'Ajman, Mohammed el-Kamarani. Range. —Settled south of Beni 'Arjalah in Hashid country. Chief villages are ; Rahabah, Harfah, Saiat, Heifah. Sub-tribes :— (a) Settled. —Beni Sinan, Beit el-Haddi, Ed-Da'udah, Beni 5 Askar, Beni Iswid, Beni Thaqafah, Beni Kenanah. (b) Nomads. —Beni Da/ud, Beni Fadl, Beni Misbah. 36.—A c amariin. A small Zeidi tribe, living round Jebel Qarah on the boundaries of the Hashid country, about twenty miles north west of Sheharah. They own fifteen or twenty small villages, of which the largest is Beit Jashish. Their chief Sheikh is Sheikh Daghshar, a man of about fifty-five who has consi derable influence in the country round. He is a great friend of the Imam and has frequently tried to make peace between him and Idrisi. 37.—Dhu Husein. The Dhu Husein are a powerful tribe of Sherifial descent inhabiting the fertile oasis of Jauf. Although somewhat isolated by reason of the distance which separates them from the main centres of the Yemen, they have always kept in close political and commercial touch and have played an important part in its history.^ Their relations have always been intimate with the Hashid and Be i, ^ so much so that they are sometimes spoken of as forming an integral part of that confederation. The troubles between the latter and the Imam have had their effect on the Dhu Husein and drawn them into two opposing camps, of which the larger seems to have remained faithfu to its old allegiance. .ill— 73 — There are several Sheikhs who appear to rank equally in importance. Of these, Sherif Ahmed Ibn Husein has always supported the Imam and gave him valuable help against the Turks in 1911. Sherif Muhsin Ibn 'Abdullah is also a trusted friend and was sent by the Imam to Aden on a political mission in August 1914. Previously he had commanded an army against Idrisi. The chief opponent of the Imam and a close friend of Nasir Ibn Mabkhut is Husein Ibn Thawabah. The tribe is noted for its fighting qualities, and its Sheikhs are better educated than is commonly the case in Yemen; their capital, Matamah, being a well known centre of learning. The Dhu Husein go in largely for horse-breeding and own perhaps the best pedigree stock in Southern Arabia. The chief sub-tribes are: A1 Thawabah (Sheikh Husein Ibn Thawabah); Beni Furyan (Sheikh Suleiman Ibn Ahmed); Dhu Gheilan; A1 Wajhah (Sheikh Nasir el-Akhram); Dhu 'Akam; Beni 'Aseian ; Beni Hashim. 38.—Zufeir. A small Zeidi tribe five miles north of the Hajjah with whom they are allied. They come under the Kaimakam Hajjah, but are said to dislike the Turks and to have lost confidence in the Imam. 39.—Marhab, Beni. A small Zeidi tribe immediately to the west of Zufeir, who come under the Kaimakam of Hajjah and are of no political importance. 40.—Hajjah. A small Zeidi tribe in and round the town of Hajjah. Since there is a Kaimakam in Hajjah, they come under the direct jurisdiction of the Turks, whom they dislike and against whom they fought in 1911. Since the Imam made peace with the Turks, their relations with him have been strained. The paramount Sheikh is 'Ali Ibn Hizam. The tribe is descended from the Beni Temim.41.—Husein, Beni. A small Zeidi tribe just to the north-west of Husn Jemei- mah. and west of the Beni Udhaqah and Jebel Meswar, paying allegiance to the Imam. Their chief Sheikh is Ahmed Husein. Formerly they were under Seyyid Ahmed Ibn Mohammed el-Kaukebani, Emir of Kaukeban and the surrounding country. Seyyid Ahmed was defeated by Mukhtar Pasha and died in captivity at San'a. His family, Beit Sheraf ed-Dm, fled to Huth. There is a small Turkish garrison at Husn Jemeimah. 42.—'Udhaqah. A small tribe who claim descent from the 'Anazah and 'Adnan and live round Jebel Meswar to the west of Amran, where there is a strong fortress at present occupied by the Turks. Their Emir is Seyyid Mohammed Ibn el-Hadi, a servant of the Imam. 43.— Aw warn, Beni. A small Zeidi tribe south-west of the Beni Husein and Wadi La'a, and about fifty miles due east of Loheiah in the mountains. Their chief Sheikhs are Ah Da am and Husein Ibn Hasan. They come under the suzerainty of the Turks, but are said to be discontented with them and with the Imam. 44.—Serbih. A small tribe whose stronghold is Da'an, three hours north of 'Amran. Their chief is Sheikh Rajeh ? who was granted the grade of Mirmiran before the Constitution and was made Pasha to secure his loyalty; but he remained staunch to the Imam and fought ^ against the Turks in 1911. Peace was signed at Da'an between Izzet Pasha and the Imam in 1911.III.—HODEIDAH—SAN A ROAD. 45.—Milhan, Ahl. Jebel Milhan is a mountain district north of the Wadi Sirdud, and extending east to the Suleil country. It is small in extent, but very fertile and populous, the inha bitants being estimated at 10,000. The principal Sheikh is Ibrahim Hasan es-Sujaf of Khuslah. The sections or clans are ; Ma zibah, Habba't, Beni IJseifri, Hamdan Beni 'Ali, Jubah, Yamamiyah, Beni Waihab, A1 f Asabah, A1 Khushlah, Surub, and A1 Mahras. 46.—Hufash. A tribe between Jebel Milhan and Bajil. They are Zeidis and belong to the Imam, though they come imme diately under the authority of the Turks whom they hate. They are allies of their northern neighbours the Sari and Mahweit, and also of the Bura ! a of Jebel Bura c a. Their chief Sheikh is 'Ali Ibn Yahya. 47.—Mahweit. A Zeidi tribe just south of Jebel Milhan.

Chief Sheikh is Seyyid Husein Ibn 'Abd er-Kahim el-Bura'i, who is on unfriendly terms with the Imam and hates the Turks, under whose immediate jurisdiction he is. He is a friend of Nasir Ibn Mabkhut of the Hashid. The tribe is allied to the Hufash, Sari, and Mahweit. I hey are a peace-loving people, r and number about 2,000 men, Yahya 'Abad is the Sheikh appointed by the Turks over Bura'a, Hajjeilah, and 5 Obal. He is about sixty-five years old and lives in Hajjeilah, The latter place and Obal muster about 400 men between them. Chief villages are ; Manwab, Kamah, Fayish, and Rukab, 50.—Makarimah. A small remnant, numbering about 2,600 men, of the house of Makrami, the ruling family of ^ am, still left in the district of Harraz. For twelve years the Makramis held the Emirate of Heimah, Harraz, Menakhah and district by gift from the Imam Muhsin, but they were expelled by Mukhtar Pasha in 1872, Their followers who remained behind have little political importance now and are chiefly engaged in trade. Like the rest of their tribe they are of the Isma'iliyah sect. In 1911 they fought for the Turks against the Imam. They occupy the villages of Mugharibah, Safiyah, Beit el-Hud, Khiyam, Beit el-Gheil, Beit el-Akbari, and Qushamin. Their chief Sheikh is Qaid el-Luf, who lives at Mugharibah. They are continually at odds with the Shafei, Zeidi, and Da udiyah tribes of the neighbourhood. 51.—Ya'aber.

Chief villages: Seihan, Marabah, Rabitah, Rubeidah, and Musna'. 58.—Muqatil. A warlike tribe in the hilly country between Menakhah and Mefhak, Husn 5 Awad being their chief fortress. During the siege of Menakhah in 1911 their country was overrun by the Imam's troops and they fought against him in self-de fence. They bear no love for the Turks, but on that occasron were glad to receive arms and food from the Kaimakam of Menakhah in return for their help. They are of the Da'udiyah sect and are markedly hostile to their Zeidi co -religionists, such as the Anis.

The Sheikh is Murshid ibn Mohammed El-Jabi who is also Turkish Kaimakam. The Mudir is Seyyid Mahmud. There are said to be seventy Sheikhs and seventy districts in Reimah, with a total strength of over 50,000 men.

He fought for him in 1911 and captured the Turkish Kaimakam of Doran, Zakari Bey. In August 1916, however, he was reported to have quarrelled with the Imam and to have closed the— 82 — road against him. The Imam accused him of collecting revenues for himself and despatched the Arabs round Dhamar against him, with what result is unknown. The tribe numbers from 8,000 to 10,000 men, but not more than 3,000 can take the field owing to lack of rifles. Their country is fertile, wheat, oats, barley, and dura being the principal crops. They are on good terms with their northern neighbours the Beni Matar. They dislike the Arabs of Jebel Reimah and also the Khaulan, whom they fought twelve years ago. With the Beni Muqatil, who are of the Da/udiyah sect and opposed to the Imam, they have a long standing feud. There is a well-known Seyyid at Doran, their chief town, by name Seyyid 'Ali Ibn Isma'il.

It passes over the usual open sterile country of the iihaina.h but is reported supplied with sufficient water, fuel, and fodder for small caravans. Food supplies can be obtained at Loheiah, Zahirah, and Zeidiyah. In addition to the ordinary traffic, it is frequently used by Turkish troops and convoys, and is certainly passable by 500 Turks with four to six guns in one party. The road from Hodeidah to Mokhah (Route No. 3) joins up the starting points of the two main routes leading from the coast to the interior (Routes Nos. 5 and 6). It is, however, not more than a track and little travel led nowadays owing to the insecurity produced on its northern stages by the recalcitrant Zataniq tribesmen. Comparatively few details are available about it. It traverses or skirts the Tihamah plain throughout, and lies accross barren desert nearly all the way. The actual track is not infrequently lost to view on account of shifting sand-drifts, and wide detours have sometimes to be made in consequence. Some parts are exceedingly heavy going. There is, in general, a sufficient supply of water from wells, but it is neither plentiful nor good. Fodder is scarce, and other supplies, except at Beit el-Faqih and Zebid, are practically nil. Route No. 4 (Sheikh Sa'id to Mokhah) is suited only to mounted parties, preferably camel sowars, or to convoys, on account of the distance between some of the wells/ It is mostly heavy going over sandy desert, but offers no special difficulties to laden camels.— 108 — Water is plentiful, but mostly brackish and only fit for animals. There is good water from springs at one or two places. Forage is scanty along the route, but there is sufficient grazing for camels as a rule. Two-thirds of Route No. 5, from Mokhah to Ta'iz, lie across the flat and sterile Tihamah plain ; the remainder is a difficult ascent to Ta c iz but practicable for transport and animals. The road crosses and recrosses the Mokhah- Ta'iz telegraph line all the way and, at Ta'iz, it joins the longitudinal route along the axis of the highlands which is described under Route No. 10. Water is sufficient at all seasons. After rain it is abundant beyond the first stage, but even then the mountain torrents become lost in the Tihamah, and but little water reaches the coast. Fodder is very limited on the first stage, but plentiful thereafter. Small quantities of foodstuffs (cereals and vegetables, cattle, sheep, and goats, milk and eggs &gt; and some poultry) are obtainable when the mountains are reached. Route No. 6, from Hodeidah to San'a, is by far the most important, in the present political state of Yemen. It is the only made road of any considerable length in Arabia. It divides itself roughly into a desert and a mountain section, the former, across the Tihamah, being often very heavy going, and the latter made up of difficult and trying ascents and descents. In 1913, the state of the road was reported to be 'bad on the mountain stages' and indifferent everywhere,' but the revetments and culverts were generally in good order. In 1915 it was said to be very bad as far as Menakhah, but fair going eyond. The Turks have often marched large forces and ransported guns (including heavy howitzers) over this road, e.g. m 1.311. It can be used for ordinary wheeled traffic on \ on the last stage between Bo'an and San'a, where even mo ors could pass. The mails are usually carried sta es U 68 with office at most of the principal— 109 — Water is plentiful and good throughout, except on the desert stages. Other supplies, such as fodder and grain, are plentiful. Our account of Route No. 7, from San'a up to Makhlaf, depends on native report alone, and distances and details in connexion with it must be accepted with all reserve. It is said to be a regular caravan track. The Yemen section of the route is mountainous. The continuation north-eastward from the plateau about Makhlaf to Riyadh is at first a purely desert route, and throughout traverses some of the least known parts of Arabia. The journey would be a severe one both in the mountains and the desert sections, and suitable for the most part for Dhelul (female camel) riders only. The road from San'a to Dahran (Route No. 8) was traversed by Glaser in 1884 as far as Khamir ; but from there onwards only native information is available, and the details and distances given are unreliable. This is the main highland road from the Yemen to the Hejaz, and is much used by pilgrims. There is also considerable export of coffee for Asir which passes along it, chiefly from the districts of Jebel Razah and Khaulan. Little is known about its supplies ; but indigent pilgrims are said to be able to beg their way from San'a to Ebhah 'without any difficulty. Route No. 9 is the trunk road up to the Yemen highlands and along their axis to San'a from Aden. From Qa'tabah to Yerim it lies through wild broken country with sudden steep ascents and descents and gener ally is bad going ; it is suitable for most part for mules only. Harris describes this section of the route as 'of the greatest difficulty ; wild broken country; road grows rougher as it proceeds.' From Yerim to San'a there is a succession of high plains divided by rough but not very elevated ridges. The going is good on the whole, but with some difficult ascents and descents. I 1 he last stage, after Wa'alan, is quite easy.— 110 — Water is plentiful throughout, except perhaps in some parts between Qa'tabah and Yerim ; fodder and foodstuffs are easily obtainable, except in some stages of the same section. Route No. 10 (Dareijah to Yerim) is suitable as far as Ta iz for all arms except wheeled artillery. It is a fairly easy and safe road, with no serious obstacles to transport except in time of flood. From Ta iz to Yerim it is more difficult than on the previous section owing to the steep and tortuous ascents and descents encountered in places; but it offers no very great obstacle to transport animals. Water is good throughout, and there is sufficient in all seasons. P odder is plentiful, or easily obtainable at most stages ; good grazing for camels all along the route; and foodstuffs (grain, cattle, chickens, eggs, etc.) are plentiful, if notice is given beforehand. Route No. 11 (San c a to ^Amran and Khamir) is easy and well supplied. Route No. 12 (Wadi Siham) has not been followed by any European traveller; it touches the Anis coffee-country, among the richest in Yemen. . ^ ] ou ^ e No. 13 is fairly well known, and was followed by the French Railway surveyors. After Hais it passes through a rich country, and up to Ramadah has easy gradients. Routes Nos. 14 and 15 are very ill-known and are tabulated here experimentally only. Both are very difficult m eir middle stages, and No. 15 is, probably, a pedestrian's rac not one for caravans. Both, however, seem to be well supplied with water and forage and to be safe; and in their upper courses they pass through well settled country. 0 er i rou tes in Yemen, given in Indian Government nnf^n i S ^^ rabl V No - 127 &gt; Hodeidah to Ibb) are C U j . ^ lere ' because we have not been able to check m or o improve upon the schemes there given.— 128 —— 151 I— 159 —STOP PRESS SUPPLEMENT.- 165 - 0 a</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000239.0x0001df_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/16/14</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x0001df</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/16/14</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Handbook of Yemen'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1917/1917</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-31T16:13:55</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (91 folios)</extent><extent>There is a list of contents at the front of the volume (f 5).</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at 1 on the front cover and terminates at 93 on the inside back cover.
