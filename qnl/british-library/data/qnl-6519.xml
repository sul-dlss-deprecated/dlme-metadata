In May 1889 the Secretary of State for India proposed that the charges of the Persian Mission should be equally divided between tbe Indian and the Imperial Governments. The total of these charges was 34,67U a year, of which India paid 24,000/., viz.:— £ 14.000 on account of Agencies at Meshed and Bushire, and miscellaneous charges under heading of “ Persian Legation ” : and 10.000 paid in England. The amount borne by the Imperial Government was stated to be— £ Mission - . - 18,491 Consulates - - 2,080 £20,571 But as India, as above shown, contributed 10,000/. towards this Imperial charge, the actual division of the cost of the Mission was— India - 24,000 England - . . - 10,571 £34,571 In making this proposal for an equal division of the charges, Lord Cross furnished data showing that the trade of England wdth Persia exceeded in value that of India with that country, and showed that Imperial political interests predominated in Persia. The Treasury (23rd August 1889) declined the proposal. They disputed the contention that the commercial interests of the United Kingdom in Persia were greater than those of India, and while not controverting the statement as to the pre dominance of Imperial interests in Persia, they desired that the contribution of India in England should continue to be 10,000/. a year. In his rejoinder of the 20th November 1889, the Secretary of State for India urged that the question should be determined mu6h more on political than on commercial considerations, and argued that the Teheran Legation was maintained chiefly for the management of the political relations between Her Majesty’s Government and Persia. Lord Cross then offered to admit as debitable to India the items of expenditure above mentioned as amounting to 14,000/. There remained the cost of the Legation establishment, and towards this Lord Cross was 19535 . 1 . 659 . ▲willing to contribute 5,000Z., thus making the total annual payment from Indian revenues 19,000/., out of a total of 34,570/. The official correspondence ends here. Since that date there have been pourparlers on the sub ject between the Foreign Office and this Office, of which the following is a brief summary :— In December 1889, a proposal was submitted by the Foreign Office to the effect,— (1) . That the cost of the Agencies in Khorassan and at Buskire should be eliminated from the Indian side of the account, and that of the Consulates (Resht and Tabriz) from the British side. (2) . That a charge for telegraphing should be assigned to each side, based on an average of their respective telegraph bills for the last three years. (3.) And that the remaining charges should be equally divided between England and India. This equal division gives 7,425/. as India’s share, and is thus arrived at:— £ Mission Charges - - - - 18,491 Deduct,— Average cost of telegrams sent by Legation to Lon- £ don - 3,007 Cost of telegrams to Teheran 2,500 5,507 Add, India’s Legation (Mis cellaneous) Charges - 4,000 Deduct, India’s telegrams - 2,133 12,984 1,867 £14,851 Sum for equal division being 7,425/. each. The total cost for each Government would thus be:— India. Moiety of 14,851/. Telegrams Agencies * Total - England. £ 7,425 2,133 - 10,600 - £20,158 Moiety of 14,851/. - Legation telegrams to Foreign Office - - - _ Foreign Office telegrams to le gation - Consulates - £ 7,425 3,007 2,600 2,080 Total £15,012.•r* iuMir ~ Kflk. / • j he i \ ndia 0ffice already agreed to proposal 1 (^rfe letter of 20th November 1889), and proposal 2, that each side should hear the cost of its own telegrams, was fair and reasonable. As some of the payments are made in rupee currency, the mean of two rates of exchange has been taken, with the result that the present pro posal works out as follows:— England would pay 15,940/., or 42 per cent. India „ „ 22,011/., or 58 „ „ Taking the total expense at 37,950/., or, say 38,000/., an equal division would give 19,000/., or 5,000/. beyond the payments in India, that is to say, the same amount of Indian contribution as was officially offered on the 20th November 1889. The Secretary of State was, however, advised to raise the Indian contribution to 20,000/. a year, so as to provide for probable additions to the Legation and Consular Staff, that is to say, the annual payment in England by India might be fixed at 6,000/. for a term of 10 years, at the expiration of which the question could be re considered. But Sir P. Currie is of opinion that a contri bution in England of less than 7,000/. would he unacceptable to the Treasury. The Political Department is not inclined to re commend that the total amount of the Indian subsidy towards the establishments in Persia shall exceed 20,000/. a year. There is no reason to expect that reductions can be effected in the cost of the agencies at Meshed and Bushire. On the contrary, the Khorassan Agency is increasing in importance, and an augmentation of charges in that quarter, rather than a diminution, is to be anticipated.
