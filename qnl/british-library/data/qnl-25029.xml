Sir o Eoheign Office May f . 1906 I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to ac knowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th. ultimo with regard to the appointment of Mirza Ali Akbar Khan as Vice-Consul and Acting Consul of Persia at Bombay. T am to state, in reply, that His Majesty's Charge d‘Affaires at Teheran has been instructed to report what are the powers of the Persian Consul-General at Calcutta in regard to the appointment of permanent Vice- Consuls, and has also been asked to furnish any general observations which he may have to offer on the subject. As regards the question of the Consul-General's powers to appoint Acting Consular Officers, I am to inform you that, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, the ruling laid down in the letter from this Department of January 20th. 1886, should still hold good. The Under Secretary of State, India Office. op'o n. No. 38 of 1906. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. POREIGN DEPARTMENT. GENERAL. To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Port William, the 22 nd March 1906. Sir, We have the honour to report that, at the request of the Consul-General for Persia at Calcutta, we have recognised, “ subject to the confirmation of His Majesty’s Government”, the appointment of Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, B.A., Barrister-at-Law, as Vice-Consul and Acting Consul for Persia at Bombay. 2. Prom the correspondence of which a copy is enclosed and which is detailed in the attached list, you will observe that the Consul-General for Persia at Calcutta claims, on the authority of Article 8 of the Persian Consular Regul ations of 1901, to have the authority to appoint Vice-Consuls in this country with the previous sanction of the Shah’s Government. He states moreover that His Imperial Majesty the Shah does not grant a firman for the appoint ment of Vice-Consuls, and he has, in fact, claimed the right to make such appointments without exhibiting the authority for his action. The acceptance of this claim would involve a departure from the practice hitherto followed in regard to these appointments in India, since it has been customary to recognise them (subject to confirmation by His Majesty’s Govern ment) only on production of a copy of a firman from His Majesty the Shah authorising the appointment in question. We are disposed to doubt whether, regard being had to the fact that Consuls-General in India have no diplomatic status, that the Persian Consul- General is not recognised as Consul-General for India but only as Consul- General at Calcutta, and that there is no Legation through which the matter can he referred to us, the section of the Consular Regulations to w r hich the Consul-General for Persia refers in his letter of the 24th January 1906 can be regarded as applicable to Consular appointments in India.«i¥p«/aBBg£ m 3. The point is not perhaps of much significance, but we have thought it desirable, while meeting the wishes of the Persian Consul-General in this particular case, to report the circumstances to His Majesty’s Government, so that a ruling may be obtained as to the practice to be adopted in such cases for the future. We have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, r. yy. 1 A¥ List of Enclosures in Despatch No. 38 (General), dated the 22nd March 1906, from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.

From— Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, B.A., Barrister-at-Law, Acting Vice-Consul for Persia at Bombay, To—The Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart* mOnt. I have the honoiir to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 1215 G.*B., dated the 8th * June, informing me of the recognition by Government of my appointment as Acting Vice-Consul for Persia at Bombay. The Consul-General for Persia had given me to understand that my appointment as Vice-Cohsul was permanent and that I should act as Consul in Bombay pending the appointment of a permanent Consul. Since my appointment has been gazetted I have written to the Consul- General, who is at present on furlough in Europe, and have received a reply that, so far as the Persian Government are concerned, my appointment as Vice- Consul is permanent, and that I am in charge of the Consulate at Bombay as Acting Consul. Under the circumstances may I ask whether the Consul-General has not made himself sufficiently clear in his letter to Government notifying my appointment, or whether (jovernment will not recognise my appointment as permanent without an authorisation from the Foreign Office in London ? i 3£NCLOStj !

I am to say that before the Government of India can provisionally recognise your permanent appointment as Vice-Consul for Persia in Bombay, it is°necessary that they should receive a copy of the firman of His Imperial Majesty the Shah confirming your appointment. If this document is now in your possession, I am to request that a copy of it may he forwarded for perusal. 3. With regard to your appointment as Acting Consul, I am to inform you that the Consul-General, in his letter dated the 4th May 1905, merely stated that you were temporarily in charge of the Consulate, and not that you were acting as Consul.

I am, however, to observe, with reference to your remark that His Imperial Majesty the Shah does not grant a firman for the appointment of a Vice-Consul^ that &amp; firman was granted in the case of Mr. C. D.

The case has, therefore, been reported to His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India with a view to a ruling being obtained as to the procedure which should be followed in future.
