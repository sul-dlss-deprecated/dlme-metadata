This memorandum seeks to provide an update to a previous memorandum of the same title which was issued by Montagu on 5 July 1920 (IOR/L/PS/18/B345). The memorandum is followed by an appendix in the form of a letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office on 2 November 1920 and its enclosure, 'note on the Christian communities in and around Mesopotamia'. The letter details the French and British spheres of influence in Mesopotamia and explains how the refugee crisis should be handled. The note details the different types of Christian groups in the area, and explains the initial reasons for the emigration of these communities from Urmia. The final folio is a copy of Montagu's initial memorandum dated 5 July 1920.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Urmia</geographic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of France, Third Republic</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Repatriation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Refugees</topic></subject><subject><topic>Assyrians</topic></subject><subject><topic>Armenians</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00035c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
