February 1918. SECRET. G.T.-3917. ■?' -r i ^ s %J 1 1 / Synopsis of our pbligMiosis to;our Allies and Others. (This Synopsis deals only with pledges given by us to foreign Powers or Nationalities, and not with any obligations into which we may have entered with our Dominions or with British commercial firms or companies.) TO FRANCE We are bound— 1. By the Pact of London (5th September, 1914), whereby we undertook not to make peace separately nor to formulate peace terms without the consent of the other signatory Powers. 2. By the Anglo-French Agreements of April-May1916 (incorrectly called the Sykes-Picot Agreement), under which we agreed, l&lt; provided the Arabs fulfil the conditions, and that they obtain the towns of Homs, Hama, Damascus, and Aleppo ’ (N.B. This reservation is to some extent invalidated by our recent assurance to the French that we had no intention of departing from the Agreement), that— (i.) France should have priority of enterprise and local loans, and supply advisers and public functionaries in the zone marked “A” on Map I in return for similar privileges being accorded to His Majesty’s Government in the zone marked “ B.” Both the zones were in theory to be included within the territory ol the future Arab State. (ii.) France should establish such administration or control as she should desire to arrange with the Arabs in the blue area on Map I in return for similar privileges to His Majesty’s Government in the red area. (iii) The brown area to be internationalised under a regime to be decided on after subsequent discussion. (iv.) We undertook not to cede Cyprus to a third Power without the consent of France. (v ) Haiffa, which is attributed to England, to be a free port and French goods to have free transit through the red area in return for similar assurances as regards Alexandretta and transit of British goods through the blue area. . , , (vi.) We also undertook not to acquire, or to consent to a_third party acquiring, any possessions in the Arabian Pemnsu a and not to cede to any but the Arab State our rights m the red area in return for a similar assurance on the (vii.) (viii.) part of France. ^ -n u We undertook not to push the Bagdad Railway in area “ B ” north of Samarra until the completion of a railway from Bagdad to Aleppo, and then only with the con- currence of France. In return France promised on similar conditions not to extend the railway m area A south of Mosul. . . The existing Turkish customs tariff was to remain m force throughout the red and blue areas for a period o twenty years. B [238]2 the enemy. Unions Delegates, 5th January, 1918). 6. In addition to the above, there are two agreements at present under negotiation with France w hich may shortly be completed (a.) A Supplementary Agreement is being negotiated whereby we would recognise that the Holy Places of Arabia ano. their immediate vicinity are open to foreign enterprise, the French recognising in return our predominant interests in the rest of Arabia. (6.) Discussions are proceeding for a mutual agreement by which in substance France will recognise for us a free hand in Egypt, and we for them a free hand in Morocco. We are bound— 1. By the Pact of London (see under France (i)). 2. By the Italian Agreement of the 26th April, 1915, whereby we pledged ourselves, subject to Italy employing the totality of her forces against all our enemies (a condition which has technically not been observed), that— (i.) Italy should obtain the territory in the Trentino and on the (u.) Italy should have sovereignty over Vallona and the Island of ^ Sasseno with sufficient territory to secure their defence. (hi.) Italy may undertake the charge of the foreign relations of the future State of Albania (i.e., establish a practical Protectorate); (iv.) And annex the Dodecanese ; (v.) And abolish the rights retained by the Sultan of Turkey • over J ri P o11 an d Cyrenaica (he., complete annexation), (vi.) that m a general way” we recognise the interest of Italy m the maintenance of the balance of power in the Mediterranean, and that, in the event of the partition or partial partition of the Ottoman Empire, or even the redistribution of zones of interest in Turkey, Italy should obtain an “ermirnklo ok™,.” j-l.. __ • *0 TO ITALY Adriatic as marked blue on Map II. (The portion marked red to be neutralised, and those marked yellow to go to Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia.) (N.B.—This does not entail a contractual obligation towards the last three.)3 (vii.) That if we or France obtained an increase in our colonial possessions in Africa, Italy might in principle claim equitable compensation, particularly in the shape of a favourable settlement of questions affecting the frontiers between Erythrea, Somaliland, and Tripoli and the adjacent British and French Colonies; (viii.) And share in any war indemnity. (ix.) We also promised to support the objections of Italy to any proposal for papal representation at the Peace Conference or anv similar negotiations. 3. Under the Agreement with Italy respecting Asia Minor (8th August, 1917), we pledged ourselves, “subject to the consent of Russia” (which has not been obtained), that— (i.) Italy might administer the zone coloured green on Map 1, and appoint functionaries, &amp;e., in the zone marked “C” on the same terms as France and Great Britain were allowed to administer or appoint functionaries in the blue and red zones and the zones “ A ” and “ B ” under the Sykes-Picot Agreement^ (ii.) Italy to enjoy reciprocal commercial privileges in the Allied zones. (iii.) If, as a result of the war, it were found impossible to partition the Ottoman Empire to the full extent contemplated in the above agreements, then the principle of the balance of power in the Mediterranean will be observed in any distribution which takes place. 4. By the decisions of the Paris Economic Conference (see France (iii) ), which, however, the Italian Government signed but have not yet ratified. 5. By the Senoussi Agreement (July 1916), under which we agreed not to conclude an arrangement with the Senoussi without a previous understanding with the Italians. TO RUSSIA We are bound (if bound at all)— 1. By the Pact of London. 1 - By the Constantinople Agreement (March 1915) under which we pledged ourselves “subject to the war being brought to a successful conclusion and to the desiderata of France and Gieat Britain in the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere being realised To agree to the incorporation in the Russian Empire of the city of Constantinople and the dependent territory as shown m yellow on Map I. 3. By the Sykes-Picot Agreement under which we agreed that— (i.) Russia might annex the portion of Asia Minor coloured yellow on Map I. , • (ii) That Powers annexing portions of the Ottoman Empire 1 should assume a proportionate charge of the Ottoman Public Debt. q -\r B The Russian Government refused to ratify the decisions of theParis Economic Conference ( [1916]. See under France (m) ), except on certain terms, and no reply has been received to alterna, tive proposals which were put before the Russian Government last year by the British and French Governments.4 TO ROUMANIA We are bound (if bound at all) ^ L B y the Roumanian Agreement (17th A = which we undertook — . , ■ t .; tv . 0 f Boumania.

TO THE KING OF THE HEDJAZ We are bound— 1 By the Anglo-French Agreements of 1916, which have been communicated to the King. . ,i tz ;„ ( , n v fkp 2. By various written assurances given to the King by the High Commissioner in Egypt, namely ° ( a ) (L7th December, 1917) that “His Majesty’s Government 1 had no intention of concluding any peace m the terms of which the freedom of the Arab people from German and Turkish domination did not form an essential condition. That His Majesty’s Government were prepared to “ recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within territories bounded on the west by the lied Sea, on the south by the Indian Ocean, on the east by the Persian Gulf and the Turco-Persian frontier. The northern and north-western to be left for subsequent discussion. As regards Mesopotamia the Ring ^ was warned that “ The established interests of Great Britain would necessitate special measures of administrative control.” That Great Britain would guarantee the Holy Places (b.) (c.) against external aggression. We are also bound by subsidiary treaties to Ibn Sand and the Idrissi Saiyid, but these obligations are of a local rather than an international character. TO JAPAN W e are bound— 1. By the Pact of London. 2. By the Assurance of the 14th February, 1917. By which we undertook that His Majesty’s Government would support at the Peace Conference Japan’s claims in regard to the disposal (i) of Germany’s rights in Shantung (Kiaochow), (ii) of the German possessions in the Pacific Islands north of the Equator. In return for which Japan will support the claims of Great Britain to the German Islands south of the Equator. 3. By the Paris Economic Conference (1916) (see under France (hi)). In ratifying the resolutions of the Conference the Japanese Government reserved considerable liberty of action, and His Majesty’s Government made similar reservations vis-d-vis of the Japanese Government.5 TO CHINA, 1. At the time when we were obtaining Chinese coolies for work in France we gave the Chinese Government an assurance (30th December, 1916) to the effect that “His Majesty’s Govern ment would protect China against any aggressive action taken by an enemy Power on the ground of a supposed breach of neutrality arising out of the engagement of these coolies.’’ 2. On the occasion of China’s entry into the war we agreed— (a.) To the raising of the Tariff to an effective 5 per cent. (b.) To the postponement of the Boxer indemnity for a period of five years. TO BELGIUM. 1. Declaration of the 14th February, 1916, by which we assured the Belgian Government that “ Belgium will be invited to take part in the Peace Conference, and the guaranteeing Powers will not cease hostilities unless Belgium is reinstated in her political and economic independence and largely indemnified for wrongs suffered.” The guaranteeing Powers at the same time undertook to lend Belgium their assistance to secure her commercial and financial recovery. 2. By the Assurance of the 9th April, 1916, we promised the Belgian Government that we would support them at the Peace Conference with a view to maintaining the present territorial limits of the Belgian Congo and to securing for that colony a special indemnity for losses suffered during the war. 3. Lord Grey, in May 1916, indicated to the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs that if the Netherlands Government after the war desire to enter into any general agreement with us, His Majesty s Government might be prepared to use their good offices to secure a solution of the Scheldt question in a sense favourable to Belgium. The above intimation, however, can scarcely be regarded as a promise. 4. The Belgian Foreign Minister endeavoured subsequently to elicit from Lord Grey an assurance that His Majesty s Government would support the claim of Belgium for a customs union wit h Luxem bourg, Lord Grey merely replied that this was a question that concerned France more than us, but that “if the Allies won the war they ought to secure the independence and integrity of Luxembourg. ^ 5. We are also bound to Belgium under the decisions of the Paris Economic Conference. (See under 4ranee (3).) 6. By the resolutions of the Conference (Paris, October 1917), whereby the so-called policy of the bloc was ^ decided upon, i.e., enemy private property and interests in Allied or occupied territory at the end of the war is to be held as a pledge for Allied private property and interests in enemy or enemy-occupied territory. (See under France (4).) _ 7. Assurances have been given that wc will do our utmost to help in tire industrial reconstruction of Belgium, and an Inter-Allied Commission has been formed in London to consider ways and means. TO SERBIA We are bound— 1. By the decisions of the Paris Economic Conference. (See France (3).) .. b 2. By several public statements regarding restitution and reparation, and by the references to Serbia in the Allies reply to President Wilson s Peace Note. a u* ' N.B. In August 1915 we guaranteed to Serbia Bosnia, Herzegovina, Slavonia, and Syrmia, with portions of the Dalmatian [2381 °6 victory of the Allies would secure re the 6th May, 1915 that “the tor Serbia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina y nothing of what Montenegro and Croatia would have. TO PORTUGAL wide access to the Adriatic, to say 111 Portuguese claim to this district. TO GREECE We are bound only— 1. By the Treaty of 1863, which re-affirmed our position as a Power guaranteeing Greece as an independent and Constitutional Monarchy. 2. Our moral obligations towards M. Yenizelos are naturally oi^ a very binding nature, although the previous offer of Cyprus has, of course, lapsed. Moreover, under the Sykes-Picot Agreement we are bound not to cede Cyprus to any third Power without French consent. Under the Convention of 1856, to which, however, Sweden is not a party, we agreed that the Aland Islands should not be fortified by Russia. In 1915 the Germans attacked one of these islands, and the Russians then decided on placing the islands in a state of defence. They therefore assured the Swedish Government that the measures taken were defensive only, and for the period of the war. As signatories of the 1856 Convention, His Majesty’s Government have officially associated themselves with this assurance. TO HOLLAND We are bound— 1. By the official assurance, given at the beginning of the war, that if Holland maintained her neutrality we would not violate her territory. 2. By public statements (e.g., Lord Robert Cecil, House of Commons, 13th December, 1917) : “ There is not now, and never has been, any intention to interfere in any way with the independence or integrity of Holland or her possessions.” By the assurance of the 17th December, 1917, to the effect that we would respect the integrity and neutrality of Switzerland so long TO SWEDEN. TO SWITZERLAND We are bound—- and by our enemies.7 (H TO THE POLES We are not. ot course, bound by any contractual obligation, although we have ofhcially associated ourselves with the Russian declaration of March 1917' in the following terms: “ His Majesty’s Government are happy to give their complete adherence to the principle of an independent and united Poland ” {Cf- the Asquith- Briand telegram of the 16th November, 1916. ’ Reaffirmed in Mr. Lloyd George’s War Aims speech, 5th January, 1918). TO THE JEWS We are bound only by the limited assurances given to Lord Rothschild in Mr, Balfour’s letter. TO THE JUGO-SLAYS We are bound by public statements and by the reference made to their aspirations in the Allied reply to President Wilson’s Peace Note. It should be noted also that on the 30th August, 1915, Sir E. Grey assured M. Supilo that “ after the war Bosnia, Her zegovina, Southern Dalmatia, Slavonia, and Croatia shall be free. They can decide their own fate.” TO THE CZECHO-SLOYAKS We have committed ourselves only by a vague reference In the Allies’ reply to President Wilson’s Peace Note. TO THE ALBANIANS We are bound only by vague assurances of sympathy. Our obligations to Albania, incurred by the decisions of the Ambassadors Conference of 1913, and by the Florence Protocol, being of an inter national character, are presumably regarded as having lapsed with the outbreak of war, and they have in any case been superseded by our commitments under the Italian Treaty of 1915. We have been very careful to incur no obligations whatsoever towards Essad Pasha. TO THE ARMENIANS We are not bound by any valid contractual obligations, although we are morally committed to the Armenians not only by article 61 of the Berlin Treaty of 1878, but also by the many public statements made on their behalf. (See Appendix, section 8.) TO PERSIA We are not as yet bound by any definite agreements. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has, however, just been authorised to intimate to the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared, in certain circumstances, to regard the Anglo- Russian Convention of 1907 as being in suspense. We have also concluded (16th February, 1916) a local arrange ment with the Bakhtiari Khans. . . , ^ , In connection with Persia it should be borne m mmd that our responsibilities towards the Anglo-Persian Oil Company amount almost to an obligation. * TO AFGHANISTAN. The Ameer was assured in the summer of 1916 that— 1. No proposal affecting the interests of Afghanistan will be made or agreed to at the Peace Conference. 2 That if, as a° sequel to the Peace Conference, any such question should arise, nothing will be decided without the Ameer being consulted.
