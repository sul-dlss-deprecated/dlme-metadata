(K.C.2042). !• The Conwittee appointed in the early part of 1917 to consider the future adrainietration of Mesopotamia reconmended 'the amalgamation of the 'Serrice (i.e. the future Ciril Service of Mesopotamia) 'with that of the Sudan and possibly that of the Lerant •also, recruitment to these Services beinp by the «?yse 'method, and the personnel interchangeable••. In making; this recotrtdendation, however, the Committee had in view, not the immediate requirements of the Occupied districts, but the ultimate settlement after the war, under which the control of Mesopotamia was to rest, not with the Grovemment of India, but with the Foreign Office in London. The introduction of the new arrangements during: the continuance of the war does not appear to have been contemplated. 2. At present the political service in the Occupied Territories in Mesopotamia is staffed from a variety of quarters. The Indian Political Department is stronfrly represented; a certain number of officers with special qualificationo have been importert from Ertypt, and the Sudan; while the eadre aleo includeea number of military officer# (permanent and temporary) from the British and Indian Armiee, as well as one lady (yiss Bell), n The whole of the ciril staff is under the orders of an officer of the Indian Political Department (Captain Wilson) as Civil Contaissioner, who in turn is subject to the supreme authority of the General Officer Corfinandin#-ineChief. The Civil Cornrflissioner, in his political capacity, is in somewhat ill-defined subordination to the Government of India, and has the ritfht of reporting direct to His Majesty's Government, through the Secretary of State for India, on all matters relating to his special province. The General Officer Cornroandin^-ineChief is under the orders of the Array Council. 3. This arrangement may be open to criticism on general principle; but the problem of its readjustment during the continuance of the war presents considerable difficulty. The War Office advocate the formation of a 'political organisation' to deal with the affairs, not ♦Defined in only of Mesopotamia, but of the whole Middle Fast*; anjl the first para, of the they cite as precedents the Indian Political Department /ar Office Note as 'thw and the Levant Consular Service. It is clear that, so 'area about '(?between) long: as the war lasts, it would be impossible to provide 'the Adriatic 'and the the personnel for a new service. The most that could 'Caspian'. be done for the time bein^; would be to place the existing political staff in the various localities affected under a single supreme control. So far as Mesopotamia is concerned, this would presumably mean the transfertransfer of the Civil Conraiasioner and his etaff from the control of the (rovemraent of India and the India Office to that of the Poreipn Office. The affairs of Arabia, including Mejd (Bin Saud) Koweit. Bahrein and Haakat, would presumably follow suit. In every case the political officers now in char/re (the majority of whom are members of the Indian Political Department) would remain at their posts, but would thenceforward report to, ana take their orders from, the Foreign Office, instead of the Qovemment of India, as at present. 4. It may be doubted whether such a change, introduced in the middle of the war, would brin^ sufficient advantages to counterbalance the inevitable dislocation that would be caused. If the object is to secure uniform and consistent political action throughout th« whole area, it is to be feared that the effects of a mere unification of control in London, while the political officers on the spot, with their diverrrebcies of training, outlook, etc., remained unchanged, would be largely illusory. On the other hand, it would mean, at any rate so far as Kesopotamia and the E. Arabian coast are concerned, the withdrawal of the direct influence of t the Government of India from regions in which it has lory?: predominated, and which are united to India by close cornnercial and other ties. It is true that lesopotamia is to be divorced from India after the war. But there is much to be said for maintaining the Indian connection during; the period of transition. The whole British occupationoccupation is bssed upon India, and it is to India that it must look for its civil and military requirements so 1 onp 1 ts tne wir lists. The Government of India have suffered by their associstion Tith military failures in the early part of the c-unpaipji; but the work of political reconstruction, as carried out first by Sir Percy Cox and subsequently by Captain Wilson, but throughout under the puidance and inspiration of the fiovemment of India, may well challenfl» comparison with anything accomplished durinp* the war. It recently won unstinted praise from an American Relief Mine ion passing throuf^i Baghdad on its way to Persia. To eliminate the Government of India at the present »ta^:e would not only be an undeserved slur upon the Viceroy and his advisers, but mirht tend to discourage the Political Officers themselves, who could hardly be expected to welcome removal from an authority under which the majority of them have lon/^ been accustomed to serve and with which their future prospects are intimately bound up. 5. The statement of the War Office that division of political control ' has led to the rivalry between the 'Sherif and the Emir of liejd ,, cannot be accepted without qualification. As has been pointed out by ^ir R. finrrate and others, the differences between Kinp; Husain and Bin Saud are deep-rooted and of lon^ standing, and have their origin in acute personal and sectarian prejudices. The most that can be said ie that the situation has been a^pravated by the difference of outlook betweenbetween cairo, on the one liand f and India on the other. This point haa already been brou/^t to the notice of the Corrraittee, and remedial action is about to be taken. The case seems hardly to afford /TTounds for drastic rtarranfreraents on the lines advocated by the War Office, 6, It is understood that a separate Department of the Foreign Office is in process of creation to deal with the refdon covered by the War Office note. The Secretary of State for India has already offered to co-operate in every way consistent with the maintenance of the present constitutional position of the Government of India and the India Office, in order to ensure that the views of East and West, when divergent, may be harmonised as far as possible, and with the minimum of delay and friction.
