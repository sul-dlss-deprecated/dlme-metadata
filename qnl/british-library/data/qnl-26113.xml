(^y dear Reilly), You may oe itildly intereste i in the enclosed minutes Dy my Indian Vice-consul recording certain oack-chat in Mecca about affairs in the Hadhramaut. I should explain (a) that I do not f now wh it real importance attaches to Osman 4 vl-Amouii, sal 1 to be a leader of the Irshad party in Java, who has been here for some months; and ffc; that my ind an Vice-Consul, though vary familiar with Hadhramis h re, Knows very little about the Hadhramaut itself. * /hen I reed Khan Bahadur Ihaanmlah* a first minute it appeared to me that there were too many discordant not a in it. crestly a.a I bn Baud has evolved in the lirection f religious moderation, I could r;ot #ec him definitely promoting non-Wahhabi schools. It ae me i awsurd to combine talit of a ^au ii drive in the iiadfiramaut ^ith tal* of Legation control of Hadhrarai affairs here. oreover, Iheanullah seemed to have got quite an exaggerates iuea of Ibn baud’s interest in the tribes based on the Haahraroaut, whom he iocs not seem to wish to max dependent on hims.if though he might prefer to see them under Ya eni influence rather than ours. I therefore delayed sending you the first airute on the chance of hearing more. It is now supplemented by the second minuta enclosed, which records a conversation with Osman al Amoudi himself. This seems to show that ho has made little headway in ?ecea. 1 / dir Bernard Reilly, KC.‘ .0., G.I.K., .B.

Osman al jnoudi declares that the schools when start ;d will be run on liberal lines and will have no connection with the ahnabi te; chingu. He is also trying to enlist the co-operation and support of th sur &gt;oun i ng tribes, who will give word that the ichool boys belonging to all races* caste; and ere ;d* ven during the time of the war* will not be molest d by any of ths fighting trices. It Is bel tsved that he will ultimately succeed in his mission. It is also atat^a that he has got the support of the Sauai aovernment (3h ykh Abdullah Suleyman) at hie back. hsykh Abuullah has p/omlsed to supply him with all such docks required for the bo s* and it is quite probabl# th t he may also get some financial support from the .audi Govci’nm nt. In order to acquaint myeelf with morv; information, I wanted to b &amp; ai;h;r Osman al Amoudi or his close fri nd &gt;heyJch All Abdullah da Gagauo, the only *ahhabi Hsdhraml in/In tfecca.

As regards the books, he aid that there are a large number of valuable religious books with the ,audi Government and which the Government . uulishe i on tneir own expenses and are not available in the ro rket. He affirmed that dheykh ^b&amp;u iah has promised to supply such cooks, in Sufficient number, to ..h^ykh al imsdi. during hito talk, ihoykh All give ne an important and a n sw point.

It is true that Ibn gaud wild not int rfere with any territory under the British influence, but the case of Hadhramouth is diff rent.

Yeates, wq.. Carrieterns t-haw, caiho.(J 1407/704/16) Ivo. 406. (694/3/31) Sir, April 24th, 1931. I have the honour, with reference to your despatch No. 336 (J 968/704/16) of the 9th April, to transmit to you herewith a copy of a note by the Judicial Aavi&amp;er regarding the jurisdiction of Hie l&amp;ijesty 1 © Consular Courts in Egypt over subjects of Hadraaaut. I also enclose a copy of the memorandum by His Uajesty’s Consul-cene:al at Cairo to which reference is made in paragraph l of kr. Booth&amp;a note. 2. Mr. Yeatee* question was prompted by the fact that he was appearing before His Majesty’s Suprwe Court in a case to which one of the parties was a iiadramauti. While the case was before the Court Mr* Yeates addressed an enquiry regarding the competency of the Court both to the Kesidency and to the Qonsulate-Ceneral . In vievi of the fact that the Foreign Jurisdiction Act laid down the procedure for deciding the queat on Mr. Yeatee v&amp;s advised to submit the point to the Court. He refrained however from taking this course and after judgement on the merits had been given against hie client an amicable settlement w* s reached between the parties to the case. 3. You will observe from Mr. habino’s memorandum that Hie Majesty’s Courts have hitherto - and without objection by the Egyptian Government - exercised jurisdiction in probate, criminal and civil matters over Hadramsutls in accordance The Night Honourable Arthur Henderson, H.P*, etc. , etc., etc.accordance with the piowieions of Chapter 22 of Cona lar Instmctiona, which specifically includea them among Hritieh Protected Pereona# It is not eaay to reconcile thie state of affairs with the observation in paragraph 2 (4) of your despatch under reference that it would he difficult to show any grant t usage or sufferance as a ground for a claim to exercise capitulatory rights in their respect. 4. Moreover, if it is decided to reply to Mr* f^ates in the sense proposed it will he necessary to instinct His Majesty’s Consular Officers to cease to extend capitulatory protection to Hadramautis* uich a step could not long remain urknown to the native Arah lulers and it seems to me that the unfavourable effect caused thereby in Southern Arabia might he no less embarrassing than the question mentioned in paragraph 2 (5) of your despatch* /urtheraore the logical extension of the principle to other British Protected Persons of Persian Gulf origin would augment the possibility of unfortunate reactions in that part of the world where the people will be quite unable to understand the existence of two distinct connotations of tie term M British Protected Person”• 5. In all the circumstance© therefore I recommend that matters he left as they are and I suggest that as the question has no longer any practical interest for Mr. Yeates his attention should he called to Article IV of the foreign Jurisdiction Act and that he should be informed that you will give a decision on the point if and when it is referred to you by one of His Majesty’s Courts* I have etc. , (Sd* ) P&amp;kCY LOHAIHE HIGH QQWSX&amp;ZIQMte*20th April, 1931. J .1/2 -•■U-Bt -ocrytan.- . 694/1/81 . 1. I agz^ee with the reasone given by the Foreign Office for thinking it undesirable to claim consular jurisdiction in Kgypt over natives of tlie Kedraaawt. The legal possibility of doing so oepends no doubt upon the precise relations between His Majesty and the Arab Kulers of Southern Arabia of util oh I have no precise knowledge. I am inclined to think however that as a matter of usage end eufferaice the exercise of consular jurisdiction both by Great Britain and other countriea has been established on a very wide basis, and if I had to decide against the making of such a claim in respect of natives of the Hcdramawt I should endeavour to find a ground for ay decision which would limit me as little aa possible in respect of other cases which might arise. 2. I find that in a note foxwarded to you by Mr. Babino with hie letter* of the 30th October 1930 (253/36/30) he refers t.j the relations formerly existing between the Ottoman Porte and tue Kedramawt tribal chiefs. 3. It has been agreed by both the French end British Governments that consular jurisdiction rhall not be claimed in Egypt over natives df former territories of the Ottoman Edpire now under their mandate. I think it is worth while to suggest the possibility that similar ground might be usken as the basis of decision in respect of natives of the Hedraa&amp;vt. 4. As regards the 3rd paragraph of F.O. despatch Ho. 338 of the 9th of April 1931, in my opinion the question whether an individual ie a British protected person within thethe meaning of Articles 8 &amp; 4 of the i'igypt Order in Council 193^ is a queetion of law for the final ecieion of the Court* Assuming Art* 4 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act lt90 to be applicable to the Courts themselves r»et up under the Act, it appears to me, first that the application to the secretary of htate therein provided for is not obligatory an i secondly vthat it is at least doubtitil \diether it ^ae &lt;jjjr int*nd«4 tyr the uoe of the word 'decieion' to malic the * '' i-eoretary of ttate a Judge of wi^at might be a;i intricate point of la*. The argumentation in hir /rancia Piggott'e ' .xtarrltorialitj'' 1907 Ed. pp.61-64 on thia subject is no doubt known to the Foreign Office legal advieera. ^ do not think that it can have been intended to make the Secretary of State the final Judge of every plea to the Jurisdiction put forward in a consular court but that would sseem to be the effect of interpreting Art. 4 of tue roreign Jurlmilction Act in tire way wnich appears to be suggested in the despatch unaer notice. ■ (Sd.) 0. AETHUB t. BOOTH JOirlCIAL A.iVI; £K.Jurisdiction of H.M. Court© in . gypt over British Iroteoted Persons. In ©ccordmce with the Order in Council of 28th June* 1950^ pei*t If section 4 (tl) «- w foreignersf when within the limits of this •’order, who are the nationals of, or protected ••hy, any state or government which, hy treaty w or otherwise, has agreed with iiis Majesty for, ’•or consents to, the exercise of power or ’’authority in regai'd to them hy Hie Majesty, M or to the extent of such agreement or consent.'' As you will see, this paragraph is very loosely worded. There are many classes of British Protected Persons: I. Locally nrotected nersons . Persons enjoying British protection owing to tiudr employment, i.e. dragomans etc. , in foreign consulates, (e) actually employed. The Court exercises jurisdiction according to the reglement relatif aux coneulats dtrenger© of 1st August , 1865. (fc) Persons employed in foreign consulates in an honorary edacity. I do not consider that the Court can exercise jurisdiction over such persons if its competence is contested. XI. Locally pi-o tecteci persons, (a) Protected in view of aei'vices rendered by a relative of theirs (ass for instance the descendant© of the late Hen eh consular agent and Mme. d'Avierlno* ©o-called px^ineess, widow of an ex-dragoman). I have always heen of opinion thatin 1923, that £;uch protection was not ^uetiiisd, and, I BUggSstsd that the names of persons in this class should he removed from our register or British protected pei^sons. r J?he residency alter consulting Sir Sheldon ^mos and acting, I believe, on his advice instructed me to maintain their names on the registers. This decision was erroneous and was reversed a few years later. I do not believe that there are at present any persons in tuis class and the Question therefore does not arise* (b) Persons bom in ^gypt who were registered at the time of their ^i-ta British subjects but whose name was removed later from the register of British subjects on its being proved that they were illegitimate children, hverjl question in this class in this Consulate-General has been submitted to the foreign Office and authority obtained to extend protection to the person concerned. The Court exercises jurisdiction over such persona, but if it© competence is questioned it will no doubt have to declare itself Incompetent, and possibly the name of the interested British protected person till have to be i emoved from the register of British protected persona. X have made a point oi wai’ning pereons in this class of the poesibiliti of such action. III. i ntlveB of cou:.ti les Ui.uer -JrlUfi.4 P- (a; Countries that have never been under Ottoman rule. The Court exercises jurisdiction, but if its competence is contested the matter w &gt;uld have to be carefully examined a© it is very doubtful whether the subject of such cou;'tries are entitled to enjoy capitulatory rights* In the event of the competence of th© Court being questionedquestioned I would suggest that endeavouis be made to obtain for persons in this class the privileges which were enjoyed by Persian subjects in Kgypt before the %ar« These privileges are* I believe, the subject of a note exchanged with the Sublime Porte in view of the contradictory clauses in various treaties, but I have never perused this note. I believe Mr. Wadsworth, of the American Legation, has a copy of the original note. Disputes between Persians, questions of statut personnel and administration of estates of Persians were entrusted to the Persian consular authorities whilst criminal cases were referred to the local authorities, (b) Natives of countries that X’ormerly were part of the Ottoman inspire as for instance Cyprus, Palestine, Iraq etc. The Porte and Lgypt have always maintained that the natives of such countries are not entitled to capitulatory rights, and the Court never exercised jurisdiction over Cypriots before the annexation of the Island and, rlnce the war, over alestinian© and Irakians* I cannot say definitely whether natives of Kadramaut come under this class owing to the fact that no part of the country has ever been really incorporated in thv Ottoman empire, nor has the Porte ever imposed taxes, sent troops or officials, or exercised any form of sovereignty although the Hadraraaut tribal chiefs nominally recognised supremacy of the Sublime Porte and processed to be its prot^g&amp;s (see handbook of Arabia, vol.I p.229 D.1128). The fact H.M* Courts in Kgypt have always exercised jurisdiction in probate, criminal and civil matters over British protectedprojected per tone oca Hadramaut end the protection afforded to them fcy the British consulates in hgypt has never been questioned. If the competence of the Court were questioned* the Jud^e would either declare himself competent in the matter or refer the question to you for advice. IV.

No. 338. (,1 ^8/7 04/16 ) FOHEICN OFFTOE, S.W.l. 9th April, 1931. Sir, I transmit to you a copy of a latter received from Mr. R.B. Yeates, Barrister-at-Law,Cairo, enquiring whether subjects of the countrycf Hadramaut (South-jrn Arabia) enjoy capitulatory rights in Egypt, and if they have the right or not to apply to British Consular courts in Egypt for relief or to be sued therein in civil matters. Subject to any observations which you may have to make after consulting the Judicial Adviser, I propose to reply to Mr. Yeates * letter to the effect that I am not of the opinion that capitulatory rights can be claimed in Egypt for natives of the Hadramaut. 2. The grounds upon which the reply in this sense can be justified appear to me to be the following; (1) Under Article 4 of the Egypt Order-in-Council 1930 which determines the jurisdiction of His Britannic Majesty’s Supreme Court for Egypt and the Provincial Courts, the jurisdiction of these courts extends in sc far as b y Treaty, Grant, Usage, Sufferance or other lawful means His Majesty has jurisdiction in rela ti on thereto to ’’British subjects”, an expression which is defined in Article 3 (b) of the Order as including ’’British Protected persons”. (2) The expression ’’British protected persons” is not an expression with a very precise legal meaning, and appears to be used on different occasions in at least two different senses. In Sir Percy Loraine, Bart., K.C.M.C., etc•, etc ., etc ., CairoIn certain connexions the expression is used as including all persons who (in addition to British subjects) may apply to His Iv'a jesty 1 s Diplomatic and Consular Representatives abroad for assistance in foreign countries, and, in this sense of the term, it would appear that natives of the Hadramaut might be included. On the other hand, the expression is also used in a narrower sense, which perhaps more or less corresponds to the sense in vfoich “Bujets” is used in French to designate the classes of A persons who may be said to be French nationals( n ressortissants”) / although not French citizens, and, in this narrower sense, I consider that the expression ft British protected persons” covers the class of persons who, although not British subjects under the British nationality and Status of Aliens Act, are neverthe less, in international law, n ressortissants” of His Majesty: into this class of persons, for example, natives of the Malay States or of the Indian native states would certainly fall, but I do not consider that the relations of His Majesty with the Arab rulers of the Hadramaut are such as to render natives of the Hadramaut British nationals ('ressortissants”) and therefore to bring them within the class of British protected pe rsons in the narrower sense of the term. (3) It is in this narrower sense of the term that I think that the expression 'British protected persons” in the Ugypt Order- in-Council should be construed. (4) The right to exercise capitulatory rights in Egypt is derived from treaty, grant, usage and sufferance, and in the Treaty of Peace with Turkey of 1809, which is the foundation of British ex-territorial rights in Egypt, the expressions 'Englishmen” and 'subjects of England” are used, and it wouldseem to be probable that,in the expression ’’subjects of England” in this Treaty, the word ’’subjects” is used rather in the sense of the French word ”sujets n , to which reference has been made above, than in the sense of ’’British subjects” under the nationality law of the United Kingdom, the expression f ’’Englishmen” being probably intended to cover the other class of persons who would now be described as British subjects. The terms of the treaty of 1809 are at least a relevant considera tion in the interpretation of the provisions of the order-in- Council with regard to jurisdiction, though the rights of His Majesty under the Treaty may be extended by usage or sufferance. It would be difficult, however in my opinion, to show any grant, usage or sufferance as a ground for a claim to exercise capitulatory rights in respect of natives of Hadramaut. (5) If a claim to exterritorial rights were made in respect of natives of the Hadramaut and were to be disputed by the Egyptian Government, the dispute would turn upon the apprecia tion of the nature of the relations existing between His Majesty and the native Arab rulers of Southern Arabia, which would be embarrassing to His Majesty’s Government and it would on this basis be difficult to make out a convincing case for the right so claimed. (6) Finally, in view of the race and religion of the natives of the Hadramaut, the Egyptian native courts would appear to be far more suitable tribunals to exercise jurisdiction over them than either the British Consular courts or the Mixed Courts. 3. If the point should arise for decision in a British court in Egypt, for instance, by reason of a claim made by a native of the Hadramaut that he was a British protected person within the meaning of the Order-in-Council, and that the court had jurisdic tionjurisdiction on this ground the case would be one to which section 4 of the F.J. Act 1890 would sp ply and the court would under that section refer the question to me and my decision thereon would be final. If this were done, a reply would be returned in the same sense as that which it is proposed to return to Mr. Yeates' enquiry, and there would therefore be no conflict on this point between the opinion expressed by the court and that expressed in the reply to Mr. Yeates 1 letter.

YKATHS.3 6621/6661/16 V February 1 v m i r Percy juor&amp;.ine.Bkrt* t Sir, K•J tM*G*, His Lajosty's High Oommissioner, i transmit to you a copy of a letter Oairo* received from Lr* a.B* Yates, Barrister-at-I^re, Oairo, enquiring whether subjects of the country of H&amp;dramaut (Southern Arabia) enjoy capitulatory rights in Egypt, and if they have ! the right or not to apply to British Jonsular courts in %ypt for relief or to be sued there!*, l! in olvll matters* Subject to any observations 1 which you may hare to make after consulting the Judicial Adviser, I propose to reply to Lr* Yates letter to the effect that I am not of tho opinion that capitulatory rights can be claimed in Sgypt for natives of the Hadramaut* 2* She grounds upon which the reply in this sense can be justified appear to me to be the following: (1) Under Article 4 of the iSgypt Order-in-Oounoi 1930 which determines the Jurisdiction of Els Britannic/v Britannio Majesty’s Supreme Court for Egypt and the Provincial Courts, the jurisdiotion of these oourts extends in ao far as by freaty. .t, Usa^Ot Sufferance or other lawful means His Majesty has jurlsdiotion in relation thereto to 'British subjects', an expression which is defined in Article 3 (b) of the Order as including 'British Protected 'Persons'. (£) flae expression ^British protected persons' is not an expression with a very precise legal meaning, and appears to be used on different occasions in at least two different senses* In certain connexions the expression is used as including all persons who (in addition to British subjects) may apply to His kajesty's Diplomatic and Consular Hepresentativea abroad for assistance in foreign countries, and, in this sense ©f the term, it would appear that -T* ^ natives of the Badramaut might be included. On the other hand, the expression is also used in a narrower sense, which perhaps more or less corresponds to the sense in which 'Bujets'/^ -l sajots” le used In frenoh to designate ths olaeses of persons who my he said to be JPrenoh nationals ('ressortlss&amp;nts*), although not i'renoh oitizens, and, in this narrower sense, I consider that the expression 'British protected ^persons' oorers the class of persons who, although not British subjects under the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Aot, are nevertheless, in international law, 'ressortissants' of His Inujesty: into this class of persons, for example, nutires of the kalay states or of the Indian native states would certainly fall, but 1 do not consider that the relations of His Majesty with the Arab rulers of the Hadramaut are such as to render natives of the Hadramaut British nationals ('reesortissants'), and therefore to bring them within the class of British protected persons in the narrower sense of the tens* (3) It is in this narrower sense of the term that I think that the expression 'British 'protected persons' in the Jgypt Order-in-Gooneil i should be construed*\fr\ (ui) (^) Tbe right to exerolsa oapltul&amp;tory rights in JSgypt is deriTad fjrom treaty, grant, usage and su£:fer&amp;noa 9 and in the Treaty of ,-N Pe^te with Turhay of 1009, whioh is the foundation of British ex-territorial rights in iSgypt, the expressions 'jSnglishmen' and n subjects of istogland' are used, and it would seem to be probable that, in the expression ’’subjects of England” in this treaty, the word 'subjects* is used rather in the sense of the Prenoh word 'sujets', to whioh reference has been made shore, than in the sense of 'British subjects' under the nationality law of the United Kingdo*. the expression ^^ngll^hjaen' being probably intended to oover the other class of persons who would now be described as British subjects, the terms of the treaty of 1809 are at least a relerant consideration in the interpretation of the prorisions of the Crder-in-Counoil with regard to jurisdiction, though the rights of His Majesty under the treaty may be extended by usage or sufferance. It would be difficult, howerer in my opinion, to/to show any grant, usage or sufferenoe as a ground for a olalm to exercise capitulatory rights in respect of natires of Hadramaut• (5) If a claim to exterritorial rights were made In respect of natlres of the H&amp;dramaut and were to be disputed by the ifigyptlan Oorernment, the dispute would turn upon the appreciation of the nature of the relations existing between His Majesty and the native Arab rulers of Southern Arabia 9 which would be embarrassing to His Majesty's Government and it would on this basis be difficult to make out a convincing case for the right so claimed* (6) finally, in view of the race and religion of the natives of the Hadramaut, the Egyptian native courts would appear to be far more suitable tribunals to exercise jurisdiction over them than either the British Consular courts or the Mixed Courts* 3* If the point should arise for decision in a British court in gypt, for instance, by reason of a claim made by a native of the Hadramaut/fiadramaut that he was a British protested person within tho meaning of the Crder-ln- Counoil, and that the court had jurisdiction on ground the case would he one to which section 4 of the Act 189C would apply and the cowrt would under that section refer the question to me and my decision thereon would be final. If this were done, a reply would be returned in the same sense as that which it is proposed to return to Mr. Yates* enquiry, and there would therefore be no conflict on this point between the opinion expressed by the court and that expressed in the reply to Mr. Yates letter.InCi.AS C~FICE y WHITsS^ti., • S.J/i. 17th June, 1924. Dear Mr. v akely, Referring to ray telephone conversation v.lth you yesterday on the subject of the Aden Protectorate, I may sa.y that the ^oint arises in the following circuiustances. vas passed recomnaending that residence in a (British) mandated territory and in a British Protectorate should be treated as equivalent to residence in His Majesty’s Dominions for the purpose of qualifying for a grant of an Imperial Certificate of naturali zation under the British nationality and Status ot Aliens Act, 1914, as amended. The original proposal which led up to this resolution came from the Australian Commonwealth and related to mandated territories only. It vas considered, however, that it would be invidious to allow persons to qualify for naturalization by residing in mandated territories and at the same ti::ie to with hold such facilities to persons residing in British Protectorates. been prepared, a copy of which I enclose. I also enclose on a separate sheet the schedule containing the list of the various territories to which the new Act will apply. The Colonial Office who have furnished this list, feel some doubt as to whether the Aden Protectorate ought to be included, ana they suggest that as At the Imperial Conference last year a resolution To ;ive effect to this resolution a draft Bill has the India Office should/should he consulted. I do not know how important the question may be but the position, as I understand it, is that even if it is proper to call the territory in question a British Protectorate there .nay be reasons why it is unnecessary or undesirable to enable aliens by residing in that territory, and intending to continue to reside there, to qualify for an Imperial Certificate. views on the point. I am writing semi-officially in order to avoid unnecessary delay as the Bill has already for various reasons been hung up for considerable time. I shall be grateful if you will let :ne have your Yours sincerely1.

Yeates enquires as to whether subjects of the Hadramaut enjoyed capitulatory rights in Egyptian courts. The correspondence consists of a detailed legal discussion of the various definitions of 'British Protected Persons'. In the end it is communicated to Yeates that a decision regarding the jurisdiction of Consular Courts in Egypt over Hadramaut subjects will be provided by the Secretary of State, but only in the event that such a question is addressed to him through one of the courts.The papers dated 1936 (folios 2-8) consist of minutes made by Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, Indian Vice-Consul at Jedda. The first minute concerns meetings in Mecca with a Hadramaut subject named Seyyid, and a separate meeting with Shaikh Ali Abdullah Ba Dagaub. They discussed attempts by Osman al Amoudi, leader of the Irshadiya movement in Java, to open schools in the Hadramaut. Al Amoudi is said to have the backing of the Saudi Government. Shaikh Ali also discussed Saudi relations with tribes in the Hadramaut. The second minute documents a meeting with Shaikh Osman el Amudi and Shaikh Ali Badgaish, where they discussed the Qaity dynasty, Saudi intentions towards Hadramaut territories, and dissatisfaction with British involvement in the Hadramaut.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Vice-Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Legal status</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Hadramaut Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Jurisdiction</topic></subject><subject><topic>Nationality</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
