Secretary, Bahrain General Merchants 1 Association, Bahrain, Dear Sir, This is to acknowledge your letter dated 87th September 1960, containing a list of members and the rules of your association. Regarding the question of a Bahrain Chamber of Commerce, I think it would 'be desirable and Ieneficial that there should be a Chamber of Coim .ierce in Bahrain out it appears that your committee is under the impression that a'Chamber of Commerce can be formed merely by adopting the name. Chambers of Commerce all over the world are lir ^ ed a r ' international organisation which has a cental body and which meets in various countries, these meetings are attended by representatives from different parts of the world. I have, at the moment, the Chairman of the Aden Chamber of Commerce staying as a guest in my house I h f ve arranged for him to obtain and send to me ^ ^ v! £ 0r:ns etc * ' relatin K to the formation of a Chamber of Commerce. In connection with your letter, I would point out one fact and that is that neither of the banics or any of the British firms appear to he members of your organisation. As banking is one of the most important features of trade it is obvious that should a Chamber be represented. inauguratea in ^ain the banks should .V ca n provide you with further particulars about the formation of such an organisation you should ?
