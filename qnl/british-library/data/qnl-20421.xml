[E 4734/279/91] No. 1. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf — India Office, July 19.) (Confidential.) Vo\ No S^lf 3 ^ ir ' , Bushire, June 28, 1934, IN continuation of my telegram dated the 27th June, 1934, I have the honour to enclose four chronological tables showing Wahabi relations with Hasa (west of the blue line), and Qatar, the Trucial Coast and the Sultanate of Oman (east of the blue line). These, I think, dispose of any ' ancestral ' claims by Ibn Saud to any part of the territories in question, at all events to the three last named. His occupational claims to Hasa are not in dispute. 2. The submission of vague ancestral claims is a favourite device of Arab rulers, and I recollect that the Imam of the Yemen, when I was at Aden, based his claim to the Aden Protectorate partly on ancestral grounds, which on examina tion proved to be entirely fictitious. Sometimes the chaotic and tribal conditions of Arabia make it difficult to refute oiich pretentions, but in the present case the task has been comparatively simple. Hasa: (Table 'A.') 3. It will be seen from the table that, prior to Ibn Saud's occupation of Hasa in 1913, the Wahabis had only occupied that province for two comparatively short periods, i.e., twenty-three years, from 1795 to 1818. and eight years, from 1830 to 1838. This hardly comprises an ancestral claim, and Hasa is no more naturally Wahabi because they have occupied it for the last twenty years than Riyadh and Central Nejd can be said to be naturally Shammar because the latter held it from 1888 to 1902 The ancestral home of the Wahabis is, of course, Central Nejd; where they hold sway elsewhere in Arabia, it is merely by virtue of their very recent conquests. However, the point is of an academical nature. Qatar: (Table ' B.') * ^^ - 4. Ibn Saud has certainly no claims on Qatar. The Wahabis only occupied it, more than a century ago, for two years, i.e., from 1809 to 1811. On occupational grounds, the Turks, who occupied it from 1871 to 1914, would have the strongest claim, but their claim was never recognised by His Maiestv's Government, and in 1914 was renounced. Trucial Coast: (Table ' C.') 5. More than a century ago, from 1800 to 1820, Wahabi influence was strong m this area, but they have never been in occupation of on any point on the coast or in the interior with the exception of Baraimi, from which the Trucial 18, Coast sheikhs have made various efforts to eject them. Such influence as thev exercised has been retrograde, and their allies at one period were the notorious Qawasimi pirates. As British influence increased Wahabi influence waned and at present any direct influence which they have left is confined to Baraimi ,81, though the Trucial Coast sheikhs may from time to time pay Ibn Saud some sort ot tribute m order to prevent the latter inciting his^ tribes to raid their nmterland territories. (Table ' D.') ■ t i, 6 T, A - v ? rious , i™ 68 in the P a st (the last occasion being in 1865) the Wahabis with Baraimi as their centre, have ravaged the Sultanate with fire and sword' • fvwu tnbute more than one S^tan. No place in Oman however (with the exception of Baraimi), has been in occupation of the Wahabis and no tribute has been forthcoming from Muscat for manv vears [156 t—1] 5,179,T Txhlhtf} 7. In the course of this letter and in the attached tables mention has been made of ' tribute ' ( &lt;c zakat ') paid to the Wahabis. There are two sorts of tribute which are paid to Ibn Saud. There is {a) that which is paid by e inhabitants of an area under Wahabi occupation, which is of the same nature as taxes paid to any Government, and which is a recognition of Wahabi rule. (h) There is also the ' tribute ' which is exacted by Ibn k^aud from sheikhs outside his kingdom under threat of raids or other unpleasantness. This, 01 course, is the modern blackmail, or the ancient Danegeld, and is in no way a sign of submission to Wahabi rule. Such tribute as is exacted by Ibn Saud in the territories east of the blue line is Danegeld, pure and simple. , • I am sending'copies of this letter, with enclosures, to His Majesty s Minister at Jedda and the Government of India. / I* J (P* L~ - .

Wahabis maintained an agent at Baraimi until he was killed in 1869, when Wahabi influence disappeared for the time being. In connection with Baraimi, it is interesting to note that in 1904 (see p. 771) the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi took Baraimi temporarily from the Bani Naim, i.e., from the local tribes, not from the Wahabis. Exclusive agreements made by the Trucial sheikhs with His Majesty's Government. In 1905 Wahabis propose to interfere in Trucial affairs, but desist on a hint by British Government to Ibn Saud that such interference would meet with disapprobation of His Majesty's Government. In 1915 treaty concluded between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud (see under '^atar '). In 1927 (p. 89, paragraphs 14 and 15) an increase of Wahabi influence was noticed, which it was thought might interfere with the air route. Conclusion of Treaty of Jedda with Ibn Saud -(see under ' Qatar '). Air route initiated in October 1932, and has since been operating without interference. Wahabis still exercise some little influence over Baraimi, and it is possible that some of the Trucial chiefs pay some sort of tribute to Ibn Saud from time to time to prevent his inciting his tribes to raid their hinterland territories. Speaking generally however, it may be said that at the moment direct Wahab.' influence on the Trucial Coast is of little practical importance. 1 r4 D.' Reference. Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.

Note on Aerial Reconnmssances of May 9 29, 1934, obtained from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Isa of Bahrein the Residency A gent, Sharjah, and others. 1. General. IT is said that there are no settlements, other than Sakak and Ambak in the area east of the blue line as far as Abu Dhabi. This is confirmed by the aerial reconnaissances (vis'hility 4 to 7 miles) along the line Zakhnuniyah Island-Salwa n i ^ vn01 a \^ ( ^ ai( i ^ a bakhah Matti-Yas Island. There are, however desert wells here and there. 2. Sakak and Amhak. , . • ^ rcules south-east of the sea at Salwa near a conspicuous flat-topped i 1 ) con sists of a couple of stone and mud-houses, eight or nine reed huts and a gaiden oi fifty to seventy palms with wells. There are two groups of about five wells situated 3 miles south-east of Sakak. Ambak is said to be about the same size. Sakak is said to be inhabited in the summer (it was on the 29th June) but is vacated m the winter, when the people take their animals away to graze The people are A1 Morrah and pay zakat to Ibn Saud. 3. Khor-al-Odaid. Ihe Khor-al-Odaid is a fine stretch of water forming a good flyino--boat anchorage, and is connected with the sea by a channel passable for motor launches. 4. Sabakhah Matti. The ^abaknah Matti is, as the term Sabakhah implies, a saltv waste It is said to be uninhabited, but a frail from Oman to Hasa, usable by motors passes acioss it inland. On the 29th June wells (no trees or cultivation) with a few Joedoum tents, were seen some 15 miles inland on the west edge of the Sabakhah Ine coast is low and beset with shoals and reefs. 5. Dhafrah. Dhafrah (an area in the hinterland south of Abu Dhabi, not to be confused with Jafurah area south-west of Qatar) is almost entirely Manasir country and there are very few persons from other tribes (except the Awamir) there The tract is fertile, with a lot of trees and plenty of water. There are no built houses but palm branch huts are used. Water is particularly plentiful at Uqailah which is consequently used as a tribal gathering place by the Muzakis (tax-gatherers). [156 ee—IJ\i The Manasir are under a number of petty sheikhs. Rashid-bm-Mana is sal d to be the leading sheikh, but it is doubtful whether he has any real influence. 1 he Awamir, whose area is beyond Dhafrah up to Baraimi (® a ^ 1 and . a J Qitab), have a more powerful head, Hamad-bin-Rakadh. Both the Manasir a d Awamir at present pay zakat to Ibn Saud, but only, it is stated, during t e ast four or five years. The Manasir, at any rate, are said to have paid zakat to Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifah of Abu Dhabi (who died about 1918), and the history of Trucial Oman tends to confirm this. So far as can be traced none ot the tribes in this area have furnished men for the Yemen campaign. 6. Muzakis. Each year lately a party (who may number some thirty armed men with some servants) of Muzakis (tax -gatherers), has been sent to Dhafrah by the Amir ot Hasa (Abdullah-bin-Jilouwi) about April. In 1933 the head of the party was Badr-al-Utaibi, but as there were complaints of his harshness to the people, Muhammad-al-Sahali was sent in 1934. i i i p Zakat is charged at the rate of 1 dollar for each full-grown camel, halt a dollar for each young camel, and 1 dollar for every five sheep. In 1934, 10,000 dollars are said to have been collected from the Manasir in Dhafrah. If a man cannot pay in cash, it is alleged that the Muzakis take one of his best camels and assess its value at one-fifth of what it should be (this is possibly exaggerated). The Muzakis sometimes go as far afield as Baraimi (where Ibn Saud has no agent) and Oman, where, however, they do not press for fixed rates, but take what is given to them; in practice the payments vary, less if Ibn Saud is engaged in war or other preoccupations, more if he is free to deal with the matter. No zakat is paid by the Trucial chiefs to Ibn Saud, but courtesy presents of five to ten camels are sent yearly to the Amir of Hasa 'by way of friendship ' and the bearers receive presents in return. These presents do not imply any suzerainty. 7. The position seems to be that the Trucial chiefs and the tribes fear aggression from Ibn Saud and to try to placate him, the former by presents of courtesy and by listening to representations, for example, in cases affecting his nationals, and the latter by paying zakat to him. But these arrangements are of recent standing and merely indicate that for the moment Ibn Saud is sufficiently powerful to make the payment of blackmail to him an appropriate insurance. r I i' cTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT yj/! ASTERN (Arabia). 'yhh August 3, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 5063/2429/25] No. 1. i Record of Conversations during Sir A. Ryan's Visit to Taif, July 12-14, 1934.— (Received in Foreign Office, August 3.) WHEN Sheikh Yussuf Yasin met me outside the town on the 12th July, he spoke to me briefly about the King's reasons for wishing to see me. In the first place, the King had received other foreign representatives in Taif, and he wished to see also the British representative. Indeed, he hoped for an opportunity of receiving me at Riadh as well, where he had seen no British representatives for a long time, although he had met them elsewhere. The King also wished to take this opportunity of explaining his views on certain matters, notably the position to the north of his country, with special reference to Iraq, and the question of his frontiers. I expressed my gratitude to His Majesty for having enabled me to see him at Taif, and said that I had taken the instructions of my Government immediately on receiving his invitation, and had been directed to ascertain the King's views on the matters that interested him, in order to be able to report on them at home. My Government had drawn my special attention to two matters, one of which Sheikh Yussuf had mentioned, viz., frontiers, the other that of Saudi relations with Koweit. 2. My audience with the King in the evening of the 12th July was almost entirely formal. On my thanking the King for his invitation and all the kindness I had been shown, he referred very pointedly to his hope of seeing me in Riadh also, perhaps after next Ramadan, if the rains were good. The only other matter of interest mentioned was the fact that the return of the heir apparent was delayed, as Seyfal Islam Ahmed had been prevented from completing the return of hostages by trouble with rebellious Yemeni tribes. I gathered from Mr. Philby later in the evening that the news of trouble inland in the Yemen had created some stir in high Saudi circles. Incidentally, Mr. Philby spoke as an unrepentant critic of the recent peace settlement and a non-believer in its permanence. He believed still that the King had got some money payment and an assurance that the administration of the Yemen Tihama would be left in the hands of Abdullah-al-Wazir for not less than a year. 3. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin called on me at 8 a.m . on the 13th July, in accordance with my suggestion that we should have a talk before I discussed serious affairs with the King. I gave him a general outline of my instructions, emphasising the readiness of His Majesty's Government to cement their relations with Ibn Sand, their belief that a closer relationship could best be attained by the friendly settlement of outstanding questions, of which the most important were those mentioned above; their willingness to engage in conversations about these questions; and their wish to be informed as to the King's desiderata. I tried to sound Sheikh Yussuf as to whether Euad Bey could be empowered to hold conversations in London, saying that, if so. His Majesty's Government had expressed readiness to hear him, or whether the Saudi Government would prefer that the questions should be discussed on my return, after preparation in the interval. Sheikh Yussuf thanked me for my statement and my assurances of the friendly dispositions of His Majesty's Government, but said that, as the King wished to see me early and could not keep me after 10 a.m ., he preferred not to comment on what I had said. He delivered a message from the Kin^ asking me to convey to His Majesty's Government and the naval authorities an expression of his appreciation of the helpful attitude of the commanders of the Red Sea sloops during the occupation of Hodeida. I responded suitably sayine- that the reports of the officers in question had contained mnstnnt. £ [181 c—1] b C,* ■ 9^ 4 ^ f « G' A. ^ f2 4. The King received me at 9 a.m . I was accompanied as before by Mr. Furlonge and Ismail Effendi, who interpreted. Sheikh Yussuf Yasm was in attendance. 1 . ■ A 5. After compliments, I said that my Government had wished me to ta^e the first opportunity of expressing to the King in person the great pleasure witn which they had heard of the Saudi-Yemen settlement and their sense o e wisdom which His Majesty had shown in dealing with that matter, ine King observed that he desired peace with all his neighbours, firstly, because they were Arabs, and secondly, because there was nothing to divide them Relying, as he always did, on the friendship of His Majesty's Government, he had sought their advice. It accorded with his own views, and he had acted on it. I said that His Majesty's Government believed the settlement to be in the best interest ot Arabia and gave the credit for it to the King, who had shown firmness, and had known how to show moderation as well in the last phase. . . , 6. The King's repeated affirmation of his friendship for His Majesty s Government gave me the opportunity of saying that it was a primary point in my instructions that I was to reaffirm their friendly dispositions, which were unchanged and unchangeable, towards him and his country. I referred to the importance of removing all possible obstacles to complete friendship by settling certain questions, and to the wish of His Majesty's Government to be informed as to the desiderata of the King. 7. The King started with the subject of Iraq. His statements were long and involved, but his drift was clear. He thought that all the Arab States needed some outside Power to rely on, and, though there were other friends, that Power should be Great Britain, who was in close relations with all of the States concerned. He was worried lest Iraq, the strongest of the Arab States, should be attacked by Turkey and/or Persia, and lest he should be menaced through Iraq as a result. He observed that he was currently supposed to be hostile to the ruling family of Iraq, but the truth was that he had nothing against them. He desired their interest as well as his own. If the arrangements between His Majesty's Government and Iraq were such as to secure Iraq against the attacks he feared, he would be easy in his mind. When Fuad Bey had spoken of an Arab alliance, he had had in mind some arrangement between Iraq and Saudi Arabia to ensure their mutual safety. The King intimated that he would like to see some such arrangement arrived at under the auspices of His Majesty's Government, the friend of both. 8. I explained that my conversations with Fuad Bey, which had not been completed owing to his illness, had not carried us quite as far as the King suggested, e.g., he had not used the word ' alliance ' in connexion with Iraq. I was all the more anxious to ascertain the King's exact meaning, in order that I might convey his ideas in a definite form to my Government. I gathered from his statement that he had in mind three possible things in connexion with the dangers he feared : (a) He had said that he would be easy in his mind, if assured that the arrangements between His Majesty's Government and Iraq sufficed to safeguard the latter; (b) he had spoken of the possibility of some sort of alliance or defensive treaty between him and Iraq ; (c) he had spoken as though he contemplated some sort of an alliance to which His Majesty's Government could be a party. 9. The King did not demur to my analysis. After some further exchanges, I observed that point (c) was the only one on which I could speak. His Majesty's Government were animated in regard to the Arab States by a desire to see them prosper and by the friendly sentiments of which we had spoken, but it was contrary to their general policy to enter into alliances except in very special cases. Their treaty with Iraq was defined as a ' Treaty of Alliance,' but that alliance was the resultant of a process by which Iraq had evolved from her Turkish provincial status, through British occupation and subsequent dependence on His Majesty's Government, to her present position. This was a special case, and that of Saudi Arabia presented no analogy, for the simple reason that Ibn Saud had never been dependent on Great Britain. Great Britain had created Iraa The King had created himself. q ' 10. The King said that he was not insisting on an alliance with His Majesty's Government. Their firm friendship was as good as any alliance He redefined his ideas m terms which amounted to this : that he would like to come to an arrangement with Iraq, under the auspices of His Majesty's Governmentby which they would stand together, and which would be supported by an under taking, to be subscribed to by both the parties, that they would not stand against Great Britain or support any Power who went against her. He considered that such an arrangement would achieve his own object and would serve the interests of His Majesty's Government. 11. At 3-30 I called on the Amir Khalid, as Acting President of the Council. This visit was purely formal. The Prince was shy but self-possessed, and made mild efforts at conversation. 12. The King received me again at 4 p.m . After compliments, I said that I hoped for a further expression of his views. He replied that he had nothing more to say. In view of what Sheikh Yussuf had told me, this was obviously merely a device for throwing on us the onus of initiating the discussion of the frontier question.^ I therefore said that one of the outstanding questions which His Majesty's Government desired to see settled was that of his eastern boundaries. I explained how convinced His Majesty's Government were that the only legal basis was that resulting from the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-14. The King, I said, now ruled what had been a part of the Ottoman Empire, and had succeeded to the position of the former Turkish Government. If this thesis, to which His Majesty's Government held strongly, was admitted, they would be prepared to consider modifications of the legal frontier. I must, however, make it clear that what they had in view was minor modifications, a qualification rendered necessary by the comprehensiveness of the claims put forward in the last Saudi note in regard to Qatar and the country towards Muscat and Oman. 13. This started the King in a most vehement statement. Catching on to the mention of Qatar, Muscat and Oman, he said that he might well claim all these places as really his. He scouted the idea that the coastal principalities represented true sovereignties. They owed their existence to people who came from over the sea for trading purposes. He was not, however, he explained care fully, claiming them now, as he had entered into an agreement with His Majesty's Government regarding them. He was not going back on that agreement, even though his rule would be welcomed in the coastal areas themselves. He merely cited the moie extensive claims, which would be justified but for that agreement, in support of what he did claim, viz., authority over tribes like the Murra, an authority extending from Dhafra all the way, I gathered, to the hinterland of Oman. He denied the justice of the attitude of His Majestv's Government, even though they should insist on it, and he should be compelled to yield. 14. I cannot reproduce in an exact form what the King said but the foregoing paragraph gives the main lines of his thesis, which, as regards his ancestral claims, he supported by the following arguments, interspersed in his discourse :— (tt) His histoi ical claim to Qatar, Muscat and Oman, which he had renounced, was borne out by what had passed between one of his predecessors and Colonel Pelly. He spoke of a treaty or agreement as having been reached at that time. He was obviously speaking from general recollection, and was not even certain of Colonel Pelly's exact name, but he was quite positive that Colonel Pelly had recognised a verv extensive Saudi authority. (6) When Jasim and Ahmed-bin-Thani of Qatar had quarrelled (perhaps some forty years ago, but no exact date was mentioned), one of them had appealed to the then Ibn Saud for assistance, and the then Ibn Saud had composed the quarrel. (e) He admitted that in his early days, Ibn Rashid had held Riadh and the Tmks Hasa. Even then Turkish authority did not extend further They had never mled the Murra, &amp;c., and had at one moment requested him to use his authority over the tribes, whereupon he had sent persons whom he named, to control them. He denied absolutely the right of the Turks to alienate his ancestral rights. rp ^ observed that the King had himself come to an agreement with the tw ! he recogrused their sovereignty. He did not deny this, but said that what he had done had been done under British advice given bv uaptam fehakespear, presumably under instructions [181 o-l] B 24 16. Towards the end the King expressed his surprise on learning that the Turks had agreed to alienate rights, which were not in their lawful disposal. He denied all knowledge until recently of the Anglo-Turkish conventions. I said that surely the Saudi Government had been aware of the Anglo-Turkish Con vention of 1913, which, if I remembered rightly, was referred to specifically in the Koweit-Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922. Both the King and Sheikh Yussuf were positive that they had no previous knowledge of the con ventions of 1913-14, and made the point that they were not among the treaties communicated to Ibn Saud after the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda. Sheikh Yussuf recalled a reference to the old Koweit boundary in the Koweit- Nejd Boundary Agreement of 1922, but did not think that the Anglo-Turkish Convention as such was referred to (I subsequently verified my own recollection, which was correct). 17. I did not feel that I could invite the King to make a further com munication to His Majesty's Government during my absence on leave, as suggested in my instructions, having regard to the fact that the last official note of the Saudi Government remains unanswered, and to the extreme vigour of the King's personal reaction. I promised to report all that he had said. The audience ended at 5-30 p.m. 18. Shortly after 6 Sheikh Yussuf called on me to break the news that the King wished to give us presents. I am dealing separately with this. 19. We dined with the King at 6 • 30. He was in the best of form before and during dinner; chaffed Mr. Philby over his unwillingness to adopt the Royal suggestion that he should take a wife; expounded his own views as to the excellence of matrimony up to the extreme limits allowed by the holy law; and spoke freely of the way in which he was served by the sons of his former enemies. He laughed at reports in the press that one of the Beni Rashid was raising the Shammer against him, when the person named and others of that family were with his sons at the front. All the sons of Dawish, he said, were also at the front. 20. He started on business again about 7-30. I broached the question of the King's relations with Koweit, the adjustment of which was strongly desired by His Majesty's Government with special reference to the desirability of ending the present restriction on trade between Koweit and Nejd. A proposal, I observed, had been made quite a long time ago to seek a basis of settlement, but it had been held up by the question of the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit, a matter which also required settlement. The King expressed eagerness for a settlement of the blockade question on a basis of reciprocity. I asked what he meant; whereupon he developed, not very clearly, various views as to the effect of different prices for commodities in Nejd and Koweit and of smuggling. He said that he could not agree to customs posts on the frontier, as they would cost more than they would produce in the way of revenue, and smuggling'would still go on, I suggested that the control exercised by his blockade officer, A1 Bagawi, seemed to be pretty eftective, and that A1 Bagawi might be better employed in collecting revenue than in stopping trade. The King was not impressed by this, but, finally, said that he would welcome a meeting of representatives of himself and the sheikh to devise a settlement. He did not revert to the question of the sheikh's claims. I preferred not to carry the discussion further in view of the sheikh's attitude since the meeting of commissioners was first proposed. 21. I asked the King generally how he wished our discussion to be followed up. I was not very clear, I said, as to the plans of Fuad Bey Hamza. If Fuad Bey was coming to London and was authorised to express His Majesty's views he would have an opportunity of doing so, while I was at home. Alternatively' the ground might be prepared during my absence for the final handling of the questions on my return from leave. The King said that Fuad Bey was to spend a month in Pans and would be able to speak for him in London. He su^ffested that I should report our discussions at Taif and that any expression of H?s Majesty's Government's views should be conveyed to his Government, whereupon Fuad Bev would be instructed. I pointed out that this would take time and the Kino- presently agreed to my counter-suggestion that Fuad Bey should be acquainted with what had passed at Taif, and should be instructed at once as to the line on which he should pursue the discussion in London. 22. At this point I said that, although there were other outstanding questions, I did not wish to trouble His Majesty personally with them, and I5 proceeded to make a suitable little speech of farewell. After hearing it, the King said he had something further to speak about. His Majesty's Government were worried about restrictions on trade with Koweit. What of restrictions on trade with Nejd ? I asked what he meant and found that he referred to the action taken at Bahrein in regard to direct shipments to the Hasa Coast, and was under the impression that 'the Government' had prohibited such shipments. On my asking whether he meant His Majesty's Government or the Bahrein Government he laughed scornfully at the mention of the latter. I said that I knew of only one incident, in which the Bahrein Government had taken action to prevent an abuse of the facilities afforded by Bahrein, by a ship which had tried to take advantage of these facilities to land cargo at Bahrein and so lighten herself sufficiently to be able to land cargo on the Hasa coast, where the ports were not equipped to receive cargoes in the ordinary way. I observed that the ship had proceeded before the matter could be referred to higher authority, but that His Majesty's Government had subsequently proposed a discussion of the whole subject of transit, including that of direct shipments to the mainland. The Saudi Govern ment had rejected this proposal, and, on receipt of a further communication from the Legation, had transferred the negotiations to London, with the result that I had not been concerned in them for nearly two years. 23. The King was insistent that no obstacles should be placed in the way of direct shipment to his ports. If it was a question of port equipment, he said, he could complete the equipment in two months, but what would be the good, if ships were prevented from taking cargo to Ras Tanura ? And why should that port be treated differently from Debai, Basra or any other port? He asked for an assurance that, if he did equip Ras Tanura, ships should not be prevented from going there. Indeed, at one moment he asked that they should be told to go there, to which I replied that His Majesty's Government could not in normal times direct the movements of ships. I pressed him on the subject of the alleged prohibition and at last elicited the admission that he could not substantiate the allegation, though he still evidently thought that an adverse attitude was being taken up. I promised to report what he said, but adhered to my own view that the Saudi Government would have done better to fall in with the proposal of His Majesty's Government for a general discussion with the object of reconciling the interest of Bahrein and the mainland by an agreement, which could, if necessary, be made operative for a fixed time. 24. The chief interest of this discussion was the revelation it afforded of the King's bitter personal resentment. He threw out references which I did not understand, to other countries like Japan, &amp;c., and their attitude towards similar problems. He clung to his grievance long after the latest hour at which he told me he could say his prayers. It was well after 9 when I was able to leave him. 25. Shortly before 10, Sheikh Yussuf called again to deliver the Arab clothes, which I had consented to receive. At 4 a.m . next day he was on the spot once more to see me off. I delayed my departure a short time for a final word about the Bahrein question. I said I had been impressed by the King's anxiety to treat the question of direct shipments as a separate issue. I did not wish His Majesty to think that I had been difficult the previous evening, and assured him that on my return to London I would go into the whole matter. 26. The foregoing account of my conversation at Taif is accurate on all main points, but is not an exact record of all that passed, e.g., as regards the sequence of the individual discussions. For one thing my interpreter was far from well, and the King tried him very high, by delivering long speeches, impossible to render in all their details after he had let himself go. I have omitted various non-essentials, e.g., the King, when foreshadowing future trouble in Northern Arabia, referred to conversations with Captain Shakespear, in which he had similarly foreshadowed the Great War; and, in professing his friendship for His Majesty's Government, he described his confidence in them as being unaffected by the suggestion of Turks and others that His Majesty's Government were, in reality, hostile to him. 27. The general impression I derived was that the King is genuinely desirous of consolidating his position vis-a-vis of His Majesty's Government, but is extremely bitter over certain recent aspects of their policy, notably their attempt to impose on him the 'blue line.' He is almost equally bitter over the Bahrein question, because all that he has grasped of it is the appearance in his eyes of an attempt to boycott his endeavours to develop Ras Tanura and to keephim in a sort of dependence. I gathered from conversations with Mr. Philby on my return journey the next day that the King had sat up rather later than usual with his intimates after my departure, and had spoken at large, in a tone of excited indignation, about those two questions. Mr. Philby, himself rather excited, said that the King had expressed his firm determination not to give way on the ' blue line ' question. He emphasised the unfortunateness of the moment at which the 'blue line ' doctrine had been propounded and begged me to avert a further war. ANDREW RYAN. Foreign Office, July 30. 1934. OTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT 1 M EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 5064/2429/25] \/vO F tV \ July 30, 1934. Section 2. No. 1. M V\ (a l /6/w Memorandum respecting Anglo-Saudi Relations, as seen hy Sir A. Ryan in July 1934. IN my despatch No. 233 of the 20th June, 1931, I discussed Ibn Saud's attitude in regard to his relations with His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, in the light of long conversations which I had had with Fuad Bey Hamza and the King himself. At that time he sought a rapprochement with His Majesty's Government. He was obsessed by suspicion of the Hashimite rulers and one of his objects was the impossible one of ousting them from the position of special favour accorded to them by His Majesty's Government. 2. When I returned to England in February 1932 in the special circum stances of the Bakhit slavery case, I attempted to review generally, but systematically, the position as between Ibn Saud and His Majesty's Government in a memorandum submitted at home on the 23rd February, 1932. Many of the statements and conclusions in that memorandum now call for revision, not so much, I think, because they were erroneous at the time (except in one particular, to which I will revert), as because of many changes in the situation in Arabia since it was written. In one respect, however, the position is similar to that of June 1931. Ibn Saud still sees in His Majesty's Government the most important foreign factor in the world about him and he again seeks a rapprochement in a spirit of anxious misgiving. I again attempt a general review in the light of my recent conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza and then with the King at Taif, which I am recording separately. 3. I cannot do better than use the same structure as in my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, with which I hope that this paper may be compared. (A) Position as regards Various Questions of Interest to His Majesty's Government. 4. In my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I enumerated these questions under twelve heads as follows :— (1) Transjordan frontier question. (2) Persian Gulf questions. (3) Arabian air route. (4) Shell benzine. (5) Other money matters. (6) Pilgrimage. (7) Slavery. (8) Deportation of British subjects and protected persons. (9) Aqaba and Maan. (10) Hejaz Railway. (11) Naval visits. (12) Treatment of foreign representatives in Jedda. 5. Subject to important modifications, the above list of headings still covers all outstanding matters of sufficient importance to affect, or to be capable of anecting, the general relations between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud I he present position in regard to each may be briefly and roughly summed ud as lollows :— 1 (1) Transjordan Frontier. This has ceased to create any serious difficulty since the conclusion of the Saud 1 Transjordan Treaty of July 1933. The attitude of the Saudi authorities ^ lves rise tf) some iocal complaint, but there has been no renewal of [156gg-2] B if /I i fo* ,**** wnifiltftffc vil controversy with the Saudi Government and there is no reason to anticipate any recrudescence of serious trouble, so long as Ibn Saud adheres to his present policy and the Amir Abdullah refrains from embroiling himself in the internal affairs of Saudi Arabia. (2) Persian Gulf Questions. These, on the other hand, have assumed major importance and may now be classified under the following four heads, the last of which is of capital importance to our relations with Ibn Saud :— (a) Koweit Blockade. —No substantial progress has been made with the solution of this problem since February 1932. Now that the Transjordan frontier is out of the way, His Majesty's Government would like to press for a removal of Ibn Saud's embargo on trade between Koweit and Nejd. Their action has been hampered by the attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit, notably in regard to his old claims against Ibn Saud. (b) 'Bahrein Transit Dues. —This question, which is eminently one for a rational business settlement, has been singularly complicated by the Ahmedi incident of about October 1932 and the growth in Ibn Saud's mind of a'~beiie^ that His Majesty's Government are determined, in the interests of Bahrein, to boycott direct trade with the Hasa Coast. The personal resentment shown by the King during my recent visit to Taif gives this aspect of the general question of transit a special importance. (c) Oil. —This has become an important factor in the whole situation in North-Eastern Arabia since the grant of the Hasa Oil Commission to the Standard Oil Company of California. The most immediate matter of common concern to His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud is the proposed concession for the Koweit neutral zone. It is firmly believed by the British authorities in the Persian Gulf that Ibn Saud is also taking a hand in the business of the proposed Qatar concession. (d) The Blue Line. —The oil question was mainly instrumental in directing attention last year to uncertainty in regard to the frontier of Qatar and by inference to the whole question of the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia. After much consideration His Majesty's Government decided to take their stand on Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, as establishing a legal position which must be the basis of any discussion with the Saudi Govern ment, to whom they would be prepared to make some concessions, but only minor concessions. Ibn Saud's reaction has been not less violent than was to be expected. He has begun by asserting, on legal and historical grounds, claims to territory far beyond the blue line established by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions. (3) Arabian Air Route. Further efforts since February 1932 to obtain certain facilities from Ibn Saud in respect of the Hasa Coast ended last year in a deadlock. Ibn Saud was prepared in principle to grant the facilities, but on exorbitant money terms. The amount which His Majesty's Government was prepared to pay was not such as could possibly attract a ruler so jealous of his sovereign rights. We have been living from hand to mouth, reducing what are technically violations of his territory by forced landings and flying over to a minimum and apologising for them before the Saudi Government have time to protest. This has worked well enough in the conditions of the last year, as it has not suited Ibn Saud to be sticky with His Majesty's Government over small matters. He cannot, however, count indefinitely on his continued complaisance. (4) and (5) Pecuniary Claims in regard to Shell Benzine, &amp;c. The Shell benzine affair was settled by a commercial agreement in 1932 and this has panned out satisfactorily for feheil. I he E.T.C. cable account with the Saudi Government continues to fall into arrear, but the debit balances have not of late been such as to alarm the company. Other private claims are not so important as to affect relations between the Governments. The only claims which stiU call for notice in this connexion are what has now become a'joint claim of His Majesty s Government and the Government of India for the cost of arms supplied to Ibn Saud by the latter in 1929 and the claim of His Majesty's Govern-3 ment in respect of the Saudi share in the cost of the MacDonnell enquiry in 1930. No progress has been made towards the recovery of these claims since February 1932. Strong efforts made at the instance of the Treasury last autumn failed, and the matter was subsequently left in abeyance pending the liquidation of the Saudi \emen situation. I returned to the charge early this month, but the prospect of any early recovery of the amounts is still poor. (6) Pilgrimage. No action was taken on my tentative suggestion in February 1932 that, if a fa\ourable opportunity offered, we might attempt a general agreement regarding temporal matters affecting British pilgrims. I no longer think that such an attempt would serve much useful purpose, as pilgrimage conditions in the Heiaz have been slowly improving and I think that further improvement can be left to the Saudi Government's sense of self-interest, Ibn Saud's not insincere desire to do his duty by pilgrims, even though they must be exploited, and to outside Moslem influences. I should like, however, to arrive at a reasonable settlement of the question of the Government of India dispensaries, which I brought up to date in a recent despatch. (7) Slavery. I have recently submitted elaborate reports on this question. Broadly speaking, the position is that, if Fuad Bey Hamza can be trusted, Ibn Saud might be induced to promulgate a public act imposing severe restrictions on the traffic in slaves, but is as keen as ever on getting His Majesty's Government to abandon the right of manumitting and repatriating slaves taking refuge in the Legation at Jedda. My despatches set forth the pros and cons of a deal on those^lines, which, on the whole, I favour. Nothing can usefully be done at present to promote the larger object of securing a general suppression of slavery in Saudi Arabia. (8) Deportation. Deportation cases, as such, have given less trouble of late than they did three years ago. 1 his heading may now be replaced by the additional heading- at (13) below. (9) A qaba and Maan. There has been no essential change since February 1932 in regard to this question. It looked last year as though Ibn Saud might seek to reopen it as soon as the Treaty of Jedda became denunciable in March 1934. More recent indications have shown that, while anxious to maintain the reservations he made in 1927, he realises that it would be useless and impolitic to reopen the question at present. On the other hand, the completion of new maps of the frontier area may create an awkward situation for His Majesty's Government, if it should be found necessary to seek Ibn Saud's consent to a modification of the de facto frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz. This question might by extension affect also the position in regard to the frontier between Transjordan and Nejd. (10) Hejaz Railway. The Saudi Government have recently reopened the question of reconditioning this railway as a whole. They seem ready to shelve indefinitely, bv a reservation^ the questions of the ownership and alleged Wakf character of the railway His Majesty's Government are considering the matter sympathetically in consultation with the French Government. (11) Naval Visits. There has been no change in the position since February 1932. The Red Sea sloops continue to visit Jedda four or five times a year, after the Legation has notmed the Saudi Government, without, however, asking for permission for the visits. They do not attempt to visit other ports, including, by an elucidation of standing instructions, anchorages in the Farsan Islands/ This limits the [156 gg—2] B 2freedom of action of the sloops, but is not attended by any serious disadvantages Last year the Saudi Government spoke of enacting general regulations on naval visits, but they have not so far taken any definite action in this sense. (12) Treatment of Foreign Representatives. The position described in my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, remains unaltered in essentials, but there has been some improvement in matters of detail. The Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs has been somewhat strengthened, and, though its remoteness from Jedda still causes inconvenience, opportunities for oral discussion are afforded more frequently and somewhat more regularly. There had been breaches in the practice of confining European foreign representatives to Jedda, the most important being my recent visit to Taif by invitation, and the King's expression of hope that he would be able to receive me in Riadh also. There has been less inclination to head the Legation off representations on behalf of British Moslems. On the other hand, the Saudi Government are again playing with the idea of making distinctions between diplomatic and consular officers. I gathered this from a personal conversation with Fuad Bey some weeks ago, when he was inclined to insist that the distinction must be made, though he inferred that non-diplomatic officers would not necessarily be deprived of certain privileges, e.g., customs immunity. I urged him to let well alone, and his illness deprived me of any opportunity of exploring the matter further. We must be prepared, sooner or later, for attempts to curtail the very extensive privileges at present enjoyed by all members of the Legation staff, attempts which it may be difficult to resist, but which, in the conditions of Jedda, would have extremely inconvenient consequences. I add one general heading in substitution for (8), viz. :— (13) Attitude of the Saudi Government towards Moslem British Subjects and Protected Persons. This problem has grown in importance since 1932, owing to the increasing indications of a drive on the part of the Saudi Government to reduce certain foreign elements in their country, especially su'ch as tend to over-populate the towns, and, in particular, Mecca, with nondescripts. Broadly speaking, it may be said that their policy is less open to criticism than the methods employed in their spasmodic attempts to give effect to it. The growth of xenophobia, however, directs attention to the lack of any droit d'etahlissement whatsoever. I have dealt with the whole subject at length in a recent despatch to the Foreign Office. 6. If any general settlement of outstanding questions with the Saudi Government was attempted, it would be necessary to ensure the completeness of the above list, but it certainly omits nothing of first-class importance bearing on their relations with His Majesty's Government. So far as British interests are concerned, the most important at present are those under heads (2), (3) and (7); and, in a less degree, (6), as regards dispensaries, (12) as regards diplomatic and consular privileges, and (13). Ibn Saud, on his side, attaches supreme importance to (2) (d), and considerable importance to (2) (b) and (c), to (7) as regards manumission, and to (10). (B) Position of Ibn Saud. 7. In my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I said that ' Ibn Saud is almost certainly on the down grade.' This estimate has been falsified by his good luck on various occasions since then, and still more by the '-ood management which has enabled him to take advantage of his luck. Were his nnancial position more assured, he would now be in a very strong position, thanks to his repression of the revolts in the Northern Hejaz and Asir in 1932 his success in avoiding serious trouble with elements which might be temrited to turn against him in Nejd, and by his conduct of his quarrel with the Imam Yahya, in the last stages of which he renounced any idea of conquerino- the Yemen, but established a legal title to the whole of Asir and Neiran and sterilised, probably for a long time to come, if not for ever, the influence of the1 itages i s worth while to run through the reasons I gave in my memorandum Dava! oi the 23rd February, 1932, for the then apparent deterioration of Ibn Sand's political position ; — {a) The administration of the Hejaz has not become less efficient, and has peinaps somewhat rmproved. There are fewer internal signs of discontent with toon t e Saudi regime than there were in 1931. It cannot be called popular, but some a least oi the tribes are too broken to think of resistance, the townsmen seem moie resigned, and some of them have an increasing interest in the stability of the present regime. J {h) Such general indfcations as afford a criterion suggest that Ibn Sand has stiengthened his position vis-a-vis the extreme Wahhabi opponents of modern ideas It is impossible to form any exact estimate, but the King has shown foo 1 ? f 010111688 if prions directions, and less is heard of the Ulama of Neid.

Care- lully nurtured sympathy with him seems to abound in Palestine and in Syria perhaps also m more independent Arab countries. The unexpected death of mg Jjeisal last year has removed his most conspicuous rival in the Arab world Mis display of moderation in his final settlement with the Imam has advertised un as a man who is first and foremost a good Arab, all the more so as other good Arabs, like the would-be mediators, headed by the Grand Mufti of Palestine have been enabled to claim an unearned share of the credit. He has, in fact, discreetly avoided any appearance of a desire to dominate the Arab world too exclusively and nas beaten with all the more effect the Moslem Arab drum * ,^) Refining himself a good but not extreme Wahhabi, Ibn Saud has tended to show greater tolerance towards Moslems of other denominations both bunm and bhia. He divides the sympathies of non-Arab Moslems generally, but he has probably more admirers in countries like India, and perhaps the Dutch Jiast Indies, than he had some years ago. Even in Egypt, the third largest contributor to the pilgrimage, there is a strong tendency to criticise King Fuad's policy of holding him at arm's length. gru^us (e) Ibn Saud is still isolated from the general life of the family of non- Moslem nations. Even here, however, there are signs of a readiness on liis part to increase his intercourse with individual nations; and, though the signs are small they may foreshadow a process capable of considerable acceleration in the more favourable conditions which would result from a consolidation of his position in Arabia. He has realised that he must look west for any serious help in developinc his resources, witness the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to the Americans and his readiness to treat with Europeans for the grant of other concessions (/) He is still poor m competent advisers on other than purely Arab affairs 1 here have been no notable additions to the list, but the men he has have grown i. Minister of Finance has learnt the useful lesson that, e old debts may be put on the long finger, current liabilities must be met if credit is to be maintained. Payments in respect of immediate transactions have been much more punctual of late. Euad Bey Hamza is a doubtful factor.

Should he remain in it and retain his health he is capable of rendering much service as a liaison between Saudi Arabia and the modern world Even Sheikh Yussuf Yasin has achieved more elasticity. Some othei less well-known men have also come on, like Muhammad Tawil a Heiazi whom Ibn Saud has used successfully in Hasa, and perhaps the Ibn Muammar a Nejdi, who represents him in Bagdad.

Britain has a sphere of influence in Eastern Arabia, except m the sense that her influence extends to the coastal principalities up to their territorial limits, what- 14 It appears to me further that the Anglo-Saudi 1 reaty of December 1915 destroyed the validity of the ' blue line ' by substituting a new criterion for the determination of Ibn Saud's boundaries. He was to be recognised as independent within his ancestral limits. These limits may conceivably have am west of the ' blue line ' This appears to be Colonel Fowle s latest contention, but i ha\ e not seen his paper on the subject. The limits may have lam east of the blue line ' as Ibn Sand contends, invoking in support of his claim the proceedings o the Pelly mission, the records of which I have not seen either. My point is that the 1915 treaty imposed on His Majesty's Government an obligation to accept the ancestral limits in due course as determining the boundary and implied that the coastal principalities extended up to this boundary. I have toyed with the argument that the treaty of 1915 imposed limitations on Ibn Saud's sovereignty and that the treatv of 1927, which removed those limitations, again altered the whole position and re-entitled His Majesty's Government to rely on the 'blue line.' on the ground that Ibn Saud was no longer negotiating as a rebel against Turkish authority, but as the ruler of a succession State. _ 15. This argument, however, carries no conviction in my own mind. It ^ corresponds with what His Majesty's Government believed to be the position in 1927, they might well have been expected to make it clear, instead of which they made no reference to the 'blue line,' and again treated the coastal principalitiesas though they were Ibn Saud's neighbours. The argument would be stronger, if it could be shown that when the Nejd-Koweit frontier was redrawn in 1922, Ibn Sand explicitly admitted the validity of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as a starting-point, but I have no record in Jedda of the negotiations regarding the Nejd-Koweit boundary. 16. Whatever the legal position, the political considerations are of much greater moment. I am convinced that Ibn Saud will never admit that the Turks had any right to dispose of territories over which, he affirms, his Arab ancestors ruled, and which had, in his view, been simply usurped, partly by the Turks and partly by Ibn Rashid. Hatred of the Turks is in his blood, and he will accept no position, however sustained by legal argument, which rests on an ex post facto recognition of their rights. One might as well expect Mr. de Valera to swallow Pope Adrian's bull. 17. Nor will Ibn Saud waive his claim to jurisdiction over tribes like the Murra, who may or may not have submitted to his ancestors, but who have been within his sphere of influence and no other for many years. However great his desire for a rapprochement with His Majesty's Government he will be at least as insistent on his claim to a great part of the hinterland of the Trucial coast as he has been on his claim to Najran, which, until the Imam admitted it, rested on similar foundations. He may accept a compromise, but not a compromise turning on a minor modification of the 'blue line,' or a compromise involving the recognition of a British sphere in the interior of Arabia, distinct from their sphere as quasi-protectors of the coastal States. If he recognised the existence of such a distinct British sphere, he would go down to Arab history as one of the lost leaders. 18. I do not think I exaggerate when I say that the future relations of His Majesty's Government with Ibn Saud will depend very largely on their attitude in regard to this question. If we take the possible course of shelving it on the basis that each side reserves its position, he will remain with a rankling sense of injury. In my opinion the issue must be faced, and His Majesty's Government must choose between a more or less open breach with Ibn Saud or a generous settlement with him. 19. I have throughout regretted the unwillingness of His Majesty's Govern ment to admit frankly to Ibn Saud that their interest in the area in dispute is due largely to its oil potentialities. He himself undoubtedly realises this, but has been too canny to raise the question of his own initiative. His interest is to assert territorial claims over an area which has been left indeterminate. That of His Majesty's Government, as I see it, is to show cause why it has become important to define the position in that area, and the best way to do so would be to discuss frankly the economic reasons for doing so. 20. In Part (C) of my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I reviewed three possible policies in regard to the questions then outstanding between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud. ^ They were in a nutshell: {a) positive support; {h) friendly laissez-faire; and {c) stiffness all along the line. On the whole, I favoured laissez-faire, and, on the whole, that policy has been followed, except as regards the Transjordan frontier question. I am now inclined to favour a more constructive policy, the corner-stone of which would be a generous settlement of the 'blue line' question. The expiration of the original period of the Treaty of Jedda and Ibn Sand's recent expression of a desire for conversations'' provide an opportunity for seeking a fairly comprehensive understanding with him, if it should suit His Majesty's Government to enter into one. 21. The form and scope of such an understanding would require careful consideration. As regards the form, we might contemplate a treaty and annexes to be substituted for the Treaty of Jedda, a supplementary treaty or a series of exchanges of notes. As regards the scope I suggest tentatively the following points for consideration :— (i) His Majesty's Government very naturally ruled out any sort of an alliance, and would presumably find it equally impossible to guarantee the security of Ibn Saud. They have, however, fore shadowed, subject to a satisfactory settlement of certain questions, a formula giving expression to the special nature of their relations with him. It might achieve his object to some extent, if the suggestedunderstanding were made operative for a longish period, say teen or twenty years, and affirmed the readiness of His Majesty s Govern ment to use their endeavours to preserve the status quo m Arabia, subiect to their undertaking no military commitment and not inter vening, except by way of good offices, in any dispute between Arabian rulers, neither party to which was in special relations with them as regards its foreign relations. Whether they would go further and meet Ibn Saud to the extent of promoting a security pact ot some sort between him and Iraq is a question beyond my competence. (ii) The understanding might define the boundaries within wnicn His Majesty's Government recognise the sovereign independence of Ibn Saud, subject to any agreements which may be entered into between the Arab Governments concerned. These boundaries would be: The present frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq; the present boundary between Nejd and JTransjordan, with, peihaps, some definition of the status of places close to it like, e.g., ITazim; a readjusted de facto or, if possible, de jure frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan; the boundarv recently established by treaty between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen; a line corresponding to the Anglo-Turkish violet and blue lines, but well to the south-east and east of them, so as to include in Ibn Saud's territories the Diras of the Murra, Manasir and other named tribes, and to avoid the creation of a distinct British sphere behind the States on the Persian Gulf coast, whose authority would be held to extend up to the new line, subject to any arrangements arrived at between these States under the auspices of His Majesty's Government; and the existing Nejd- Koweit boundary, modified, perhaps, by a division of the neutral zone. (iii) It might be agreed, though it would be difficult to obtain Ibn Saud's consent to this, that economic concessions between the blue and violet lines and the new line should be granted only to groups composed in equal parts of interests nominated by His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud respectively. (iv) Assurances might be given to Ibn Saud that His Majesty's Govern ment and the Government of Bahrein will not attempt directly or indirectly to impede direct shipments of goods to the Hasa coast, subject to the unfettered right of the Bahrein Government to levy transit dues at such rates as they may decide on goods for Nejd landed in Bahrein or transhipped in Bahrein waters, (v) A settlement of the Koweit blockade question might be made an essential condition of the understanding. (vi) The understanding might bind Ibn Saud to give reasonable facilities for landing in and flying over the coastal strip of Hasa in case of need, subject to an undertaking not to fly inland without special sanction from Ibn Saud and to payment of a reasonable annual rent, in recognition of Ibn Saud's sovereign rights. If the understanding were for fifteen or twenty years, this rent might possibly be met in anticipation by a remission of the Saudi Government debts to His Majesty's Government. (vii) His Majesty's Government might abandon the right of manumission as from the promulgation by Ibn Saud of a public act on lines to be communicated to His Majesty's Government, unofficially, but for their approval, in the course of the negotiations. (viii) The understanding might define the position in regard to the Hejaz Railway in the light of any arrangements that may be contemplated, in consultation with the French Government, during the next four months. 22. The above suggestion would not, except as regards head (i), involve any real departure from the principle hitherto followed by His Majesty's Government of dealing with each outstanding question on its merits. What it amounts to is a proposal that we should explore the possibility of effecting a simultaneous settlement of the longish number of individual questions of importance, which are now outstanding.9 23. Whether the understanding should cover any other points like Govern ment of India dispensaries, diplomatic and consular privileges, treatment of British subjects, most-favoured-nation treatment, &amp;c., would depend a good deal on whether it took the form of a new general treaty or some other form, which would leave the main text of the Treaty of Jedda intact, though not all of the annexed letters.

It is probable that on Ryan's return to Jedda he will enter on negotiations in an endeavour to secure an agreement by which all major outstanding questions between Sa^di Government and His Majesty^ Government could be settled mutual satisfaction, and friendship between the two Powers could be publicly ■ - » ... . reaffirmed* Certain preliminary discussions have taken place with Fuad Hamza in London* 3* One desideratum of Ibn Sa^d to which he attaches utmost importance is to secure modification of attitude hithert^adopted by His Majesty , s Government that Blue Line of Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 necessarily constitutes ^astern boundary of Sa'udi Arabia* Foreign Office are now advised that while these Conventions and Ibn Sa f ud , s position as successor to ^urkey give us a bargaining asset of some value, never- -theless territory to east of Blue Line, so far as it c anno t *. *2» ft v cannot be claimed for Trucial Shaikhs or Muscat, is a res nullius in which Ibn Sa'ud is entitled to ac- -quire rights by occupation or prescription. In any case it is a matter of great political importance not to allow prospects of a general settlement ?/hich would be of advantage to Hi a Majesty^ Government to break down over question of Blue Line. it has there- -fore been decided that in Hyan's negotiations whole question of Eastern frontier of Sa'udi Arabia should be discussed without pre-conditions, and that as part of a new general settlement giving His Majesty's Government their main desiderata in other directions His Majesty's Government should be prepared to make concessions in re- — gard to the i ^astern limits of Sa'udi Arabia as generous as is consistent with their own strategic and other re- -quirements in .ii »astern Arabia and the legitimate claims of Trucial Shaikhs and Sultan of Muscat. Defence Departments of His Majesty's Gov- -ernment will be consulted regarding strategic requirements. In the meantime, as first step tov/ards consideration of nature and extent of concessions v/hich might be offered I should be glad if the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf could let me have as expeditiously as may be, information on the following questions. (1) what are existing boundaries inter se of each Trucial Shaikhdom and Muscat ? It is de- -sirable to ascertain whether information in Lorimer is up to date. (2) what are regarded as boundaries, if any, of Trucial i3iiaikhdoms and Muscat tov/ards hinter land or what is extent of claim of Shaikhs and«•«a 3. and Sultan in respect of Sovereignty (*&amp;&amp;»&gt;. payment of zakat or control of or influence over tribes in the direction of the hinter- -land ? In the case of Muscat the land- -laard extent of Sultan's control and influence should, if possible, be stated right round to the point where his coast line Joins that of the Hadramaut» (3) what are views of Political Hesident as to degree to which such claims are Justi- -fiable and ought to be supported either in our ov/n interests or in legitimate interests of Rulers concerned ? 5# Information under (i) above is desirable because it is, of course, clear that whatever concessions in hinterland might be offered it would be contrary to our political and other interests to allow Ibn Sa'ud to extend his dominions to coast anywhere east of ^atar aad the Hadramaut. It is therefore necessary to make sure whether or not there are any unclaimed gaps of territory on coast between boundaries of various States. So far as coast is concerned the only possible concession would appear to be territory between Blue Line and head of Dohat es Salwa. 6 * It is possible it may be decided that any concession of Ibn Sa'ud in hinterland should be based on a ^£i^L3 ther t]ian on a strict geographical basis. This would mean that instead of defining on the map the of a salient of territory stretching eastwards from Blue Line•..4, Line it might be found preferable merely to acknow- -ledge that Ibn Sa'ud's authority extended over cer- information requested above Political Resident should give particular attention to habitats and allegiances of various tribes both settled and migratory e.g. in the case of each Ruler it should be stated what tribes or sections of tribes are settled in area controlled by Rulers and what migratory tribes or sections visit such areas. It appears that Ibn Sa , ud is particularly in terested in questions of Murra and Manasir# -tain tribes living in hinterland In collecting SEGR3TARY OF STATE FOR IHDIA.Telegram From To Repeated to H.M's Secretary of State for India, London.

These latter, who owned the districts of Hasa and latif, though forced to tribute, have always been hostile to the Ibn oaouds, and are so at the present uay.' ^ven if a claim based on such grounds coula be admitted, it is very doubtful whether this contention (sidelined at 0 of the Ibn Sa'uds can be maintained* After the fall of the Abbaside Caliphate and the tarmathian revolt with its centre round bahraln and ^atar, about the beginning of the i.lth century, Arabia fell into chaos for some two centuries# ( Oman, ^atar and liasa were organised for a time into a kind of monarchy under the Kabhan, and later ♦ Ya'aribah tribes (both ♦Oman tribes).

In what place and to whom was the 7 jakat paid^ That is the number of the camels and the goats for which every trihe or every suh-trihe paid'the -jakat and how much Zakat was taken on every camel and every head of goat 9 lo what extent does the King Ihn Saud exercise infulence in that wilderness 0 '/hat happened to the payment of the Zakat during the interval between the death of Zayid bin Khalifah and the present time. I 0\ U B. Answer s* y !• Ihe tribes which paid the Zakat to the Amir o/f Ahsa are Manasir and Bani Yas. 2. ihe years during which the Zakat was paid, ,Extend over a period oi nine years and the first payment/took, place during the rule of Sultan bin Zayid in 1343 / A.H. If5. Tlie Zakat oolleotor hiraself aoraes to tiie tripos an(i stays as their guest. Tiie Zakat oolleotors are Munammad 'bin Mansur, an orrioial of Abdullah Mn Jalawi, and Muhurnmad As^Sahll. 4* On every head of oamel Hial one is taken: there are no goats with them. 5* King I'bn ^aud and Ahdullah 'bin Jalawi exeroise no full influence in Ohufrah country except on A Manasirj* while Bani Yas claim to he Ahu Dhahi subjects. ^• Regarding what happened during the interval 'between the death of Zayid and the present day. After the demise of Zayid during the rule of Snaikh Haradan 'bin Zayid over Ahu Dhabi, a fighting took place 'between the Manasir and Bani Yas residents oi TDhufrah and the Southern Bedouins of Awamir and Duru' and it lasted for sometime. 'Che Shaikhs of the Manasir and Mazari' trihes went from Dhufrah to Ansa, oxfered the presents of camels to the Amir Abdullah oin Jalawi, sought his protection and left their camels in Ahsa desert. Abdullah hin Jalawi accepted their presents, gave them clothes and money in return and consent -ed to their coming under the aegis of the King I'bn 3aud. The Manasir stayed there with their camels as did some of the Mazari. As for the rest of the tribes of Bani Yas, A1 TTawamil, Qibyat, A1 Maharihah and Marar they left their camels in the oouthern halting places and Braimi counrty, migrating to Ahu Dhabi and the islands under it. After the dispersion of these trihes from Dhufrah Shaikh Hamdan # X 'bin Zaid came to Braimi and 'brought ahout a reconciliation amongst the lighting elements. After peace was effected the Bani Yas tribes returned one hy one to Dhufrah, repair ed tneir nouses and rennQ|%,ted their date groves. So did tne remaining Mazari tribe in Ansa with their camels and taus nad no connection left in Ahsa. with regard to the Manasir trihe some of them returned to Dhufrah with their cattle, others spend th&lt;? winter in Ahsa and summer in7 ■ otilers are • Dnufrah, while/still staying in Ahsa witti t^ieir aattle^ going and oorning from Ansa to Dnufrah. .y itfterwards Sultan 'bin ^aid killed his 'brother Siiaikn Hamdan bin ^ayid in txie year 1340 and 'beoarae the Shaikh of Abu ^habi. fne King I'bn Saud and the Arnir of Ansa turned nis enemy on aooount of the murder of his brother Hamdan bin ^ayid as he was their friend and confederate and, when the time for oolleoting ^akat from the Bedouin subjects of the King ^bn 3aud came, the Amir of Ahsa appointed his man Said with a number of others. They came to Baynunah west of Dhufrah. country and collected Zakat from the Manasir, Ma sari r and all the tribes .subject to -Dhufrah country, ohaikn. Sultan bin Zayid wanted to prevent the Zakatcollector from taking Zakat from the inhabitants of Dhufrah but was not able to do so- '.Then Shaikh Saqar bin Zayid murdered his brorher Shaikh Sultan bin Zayid in 134 5 A»H. and became the Shaikh of Ab it Dhabi, tnere grew up friendsnip and unity between him and tne King Ibn'Saud and the Amir of Ansa Abdullah bin Jalawi afraid as ne //as of tne sons of Sultan bin Zayid overthrowing him with the help of the King Ibn Saud and the Amir of Ahsa. T -re used to try to pay the Zakat collect Saqar ed from the people of Dhufrah and, Braimi. Shaikh/bin Zayid was also killed at the hands of the ^anasirs and a servant of Sultan bin Zayid,and Shakhbut bin Zayid became \he Shaikh of £bu Dhabi. In tne eiarly rule of Shakhbut bin Sultan over Abu Dhabi tne payment of Zakat became rather slow as compared with mat it was, as mentioned above, in the days of the two Shaikhs. For instance, when the Zakat-collector came to Baynunah west of Dhufrah country and '/anted to levy ^akat on the Liana sir tribes whose- camels were in Baynunah, or, when he arrived at Liwa south of Dhufrah country, levied Zakat on tne Ma^ari* tribe^and wanted to collect tie ^akat of the'^carnels from the rest of the Bani8 a 50 ;! 33. Yas tribes, they would aide their oamels and pretend that they had no oamels and that they /ere divert, and thus the Sakat-oolleotor would not insist . Similar is the oase with the. Manasirs living in Liwa south or Dhufran oountry, who, now siaoe four years, ao not pay any ^akat with the exoeption of tne A1 3u Mannar trihe whose Shaikh is in Ahsa» The reason for the tardiness in the payment of ^akat in 1349 A..11. was a fight 'between the TTawamil trihe of Bani Yas and the officials of the Amir of Ahsa in '/hlih offioial Muhammad aS 'Sahli and hi s/cjolleagues received serious 'blows and none of the four trihes paid the Zakat/vhioh was. also refused 'by the Manasirs whose oamels were in the halting plaoes of the south. The Bani Yas trihes launohed a oomplaint 'before Shaikh Shakhhut 'bin Sultan. The Shalkl: wrote letters to the Amir of Ahsa about it and the reply oame that a misunderstading had taken-plaoe between the offioials and tne Shaikh*s suhjeots. Sinoe that oase up harsh uill now trie ^akat'oo 11 eouor makes no/demands/ioon trie iaaabiaants of tne souta of Jhufrah aountry but ask?them still politely and/they do not pay any taing. The Bani Yas tribes assert taey are Abu Dhabi subjeots, all of them are divers, they go a-diving in Abu Dhabi and the islands under it and tae bhaika takes parts of their diving earnings as well as the ale at on the fruit of the date gardens in Liwa. As for the Kanasir tribes they themselves wish to remain under the .. . aegis of the King Ibn 3aud and/him ^akat beoause the latter 1 power is inorcasing \.hile the Ghaikh of.

The difficulties which have recently arisen in connection with the eastern Dun'dary of the Saudi Kingdom, the claims advanced by Ibn Saud to ancestral ghts east of the Blue Line laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 r id the suggestions put forward by him that at some period in the past arrange- ents were entered into with his ancestors, the Wahabi Amirs, by the representatives ; H.M. Government, which afforded some recognition of those claims, have made desirable to examine in some detail the history since 1800 of the connection ; the Wahabi power with the Trucial Sheikhdoms and their hinterland and with uscat; the relations between H.M. Government and the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn ind himself; and tinally the extent to which either the Wahabi Amirs or Ibn ind in the pre-war period can properly be regarded as Turkish vassals or have imitted or claimed Ottoman nationality. 2. The period to be covered falls into the following sections :— (1) 1745 to 1800.—First development of the Wahabi sect. (2) 1800 to 1870-71.—From the first expansion of the Wahabis in Eastern Arabia to the fall of Baraimi and the Turkish occupation of Hasa. (3) 1871 to 1901.—From the Turkish occupation of Hasa to the capture of Riyadh by Ibn Sand. (4) 1901 to 1914.—From the capture of Riyadh to the outbreak of the Great War. (5) 1914 to 1934.—From the outbreak of the Great War to the opening of the Blue line discussions. I.—Rise and Development of the Wahabi Power, 1745 to 1800. Origin of the Wahabi Sect. 3. It is unnecessary to examine in detail the sources and early history of the Vahabi movement. The sect appears to have been founded by Abdul Wahab and is son, Mohamed Ibn Abdul Wahab, in the early part of the eighteenth century in ^ejd, and to have advocated a return to the primitive simplicity which prevailed mong the early followers of Islam in the lifetime of the Prophet. The founders f the sect connected themselves with the Sheikhs of the Saudi family, who then |j tiled at Deriyah in Nejd ; and the movement, originally religious in character, apidly assumed a political complexion. The Saudi Sheikhs, with the assistance of he impetus given them by the Wahabi movement, rapidly extended their local afluence under the Amir Mohamed, who ruled from 1745 to 1765, at the expense irst of the neighbouring rulers of Riyadh and then of the Beni Khalid, who had, ince the middle of the seventeenth century, been the principal tribe in Hasa. 4. The first Wahabi Amir died in 1765 and was succeeded by his son, Abdul ^ziz, who ruled till his assassination in October or November of 1803. Riyadh vas captured in 1772 and the whole of Nejd came under Wahabi rule. The )rovince of Hasa was subdued for the first time in 1792 and finally in 1795, and he power of the Beni Khalid broken. Attempts by the Ottoman Government to 'e-establish its control failed, and a truce for six years, under which the Wahabis remained in possession of Hasa, was concluded in 1799. Lor. I, 1053-6. Ross : Nejd, pp. 38-9. Lor. 1, 1059. The Political Situation in Arabia in 1800. 5. With the conquest of Hasa the Saudis commenced to turn their attention to jjjhe east and south. The occasion is a convenient one briefly to review the political ^situation in Arabia in the year J 800. It was as follows :— 6. Turkey held Iraq; exercised what appears to have been a controlling influence in Koweit, and maintained a claim to Hasa and its ports. The Hejaz was also held by a Turkish vassal, the Sherif of Mecca.&gt; Lor. I, 789- 90. Lor. I, 842. Bombay Selections XXIV, 303, 429. Lor. I, 1054, 1067. Lor. I, 421. Lor. I, 429. 7. The Wahdbi Amirs held Hasa and Nejd. 8. Bahrein was in the possession of the Uttabi Sheikhs, who, originally settle ou the mainland of Arabia at Zubarah in Qatar, had expelled the Persians fro Bahrein in 1783. The Bahreini Sheikhs, apprehensive of attack by Muscat, had! 1799 made overtures to Persia and paid her tribute. In 1800 they were tem™wi subdued by Muscat. ™ 9. Qatar. —The Uttabi Sheikhs of Bahrein had hereditary possessions in QatJ and took refuge there on their expulsion from the islands by'Muscat in 1800. ' 10. The present-day Trucial Coast, then know^n as the Pirate Coast, wasrJ by Arab Sheikhs, the ancestors of the present Trucial Sheikhs. Of these SheilJ only two were of real importance, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and tlierirj Jowasimi Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, whose capital was later removed to Sharrai Ihese rulers were separated by a secular enmity, and belonged to the opposio religious factions of the Hinawi and the Ghafari. The fact that the Rulers of Muscji also belonged to the Hinawi faction formed a link between Muscat and Abu Dhail Ihe Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast held a fringe of varying depth along the coast I do not appear to have exercised any real influence in the remoter hinterland w'lut was in the possession of Bedouin tribes. 11. At the eastern end of Arabia was the independent Sultanate of Muscat this time ruled by the able and vigorous Saiyid Sultan, who succeeded in 1792 ano who had m 1794 extorted a lease of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies W ersia. Phe Sultan had m 1798 entered into an alliance with the British Govei ment and had m 1800 agreed to receive a British Political Representative. In same year he succeeded in establishing his dominion over Bahrein. 12.

Saiyid Badr, to whom they lent their leptt along|mpport, was finally elected Sultan in 1805. The new Sultan, who in 1806 co-operated Lor. I, 1076. rjjvith the British expedition against the Jowasimi pirates (paragraph 24 below), ruled he Sultanate till his assassination by Said bin Sultan in 1807. Said bin Sultan vho was to rule till 1850, was hostile to Wahabi influence, although he continued Lor. I, 1075 ,o allow a Wahabi Political Agent to reside at Muscat, and in 1809 he conducted 442. in abortive expedition against the new Wahabi Sheikh of the Jowasimis. In the same year the Wahabis delivered a successful attack upon the Sultan from Baraimi Reoir • ind the P unitive expedition sent in 1809 by the Government of India against the Bahrein aSiml f )irates (P ara g ra ph ^ below) had as an incidental object the easing of ihe pressure on the Sultan. In 1810-11, on the withdrawal of the British expedition, inent ofM-urther successful attacks were made from Baraimi by Syed bin Mutlak, the Wahabi f affairs for f ieutenant there, in face of which the Sultan appealed, but unsuccessfully, to the nmeteentir^ oveniment Iridia for assistance. These attacks in 1812-13 penetrated to the the Persia# 0ut k- east of Muscat at Sur and Jaalan ; and in the latter place the Beni bu Ali reedomfflrlF ibe w ? re permanently converted to Wahabism.

Trucial Oman and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 17. During most of the period from 1800 to 1814 the Wahabis appear to have Jt)ul - reld a dominating position in Trucial Oman and its hinterland. Their Agent attentioii established himself in 1800 in the oasis of Baraimi, which he fortified and used id occupas a base for attacks on Muscat or for bringing pressure on the Trucial Sheikhs. iingtlief s In 1803 the Jowasimi of Ras-al-Khaimah were compelled to co-operate in a Wahabi biSheis^attack on Muscat; but in 1806 a British punitive expedition sent against the Lor I ■epulsed ^Jowasimis ignored the Wahabi connection with them, and a convention concluded 1074.' ^ed unfewith the Jowasimis in that year was concluded without reference to the Wahabi ^ and afo-Amir and without protest from him. In 1808 Sultan bin Suggar, the hereditary lole coastfehief of the Jowasimi Arabs at Ras-al-Khaimah, was deposed by the Wahabis, and in n reduced'the following year a Wahabi nominee, the Sheikh of Rams, was substituted for him. ^ DC ]Jfi^The fallen Jowasimi chief was subseniifintlv Inrprl tn N aiVI nr.r! —i hem, 105' ptured The fallen Jowasimi chief was subsequently lured to Nejd and there imprisoned, but he escaped and returned through the Yemen to Muscat bearing overtures to the Sultan from the Pasha of Egypt for co-operation against the Wahabis. In Lor. 1, 1809 the Jowasimi responded to a Wahabi request for co-operation against Koweit, 445 - though nothing seems to have come of this. 18. Piracy broke out in an aggravated form after the deposition of the Jowasimi jp, ^^j.ikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and a further British expedition, with which Muscat e , co-operated, was sent in 1809-10 which reduced the pirates to submission. The 1075, gf i Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and a further British expedition, with which Muscat co-operated, was sent in 1809-10 which reduced the pirates to submission. The [ujv,'- ^S'ent at Baraimi is alleged to have proceeded to the assistance of u jj/jof] ^ a ®' a ^~-^^ a ^mah , but, if he did so, he did not arrive until after the departure of the 110 e 3076 I81i Bi i i Lor. 1,1076. punitive expedition. Shinas, which was held by a Wahabi Governor, was forced to surrender. The Government of India, anxious to avoid involving the® selves in any way with the Wahabis, turned a blind eye so far as possible to Wahab responsibility (as to the degree of which there is room for difference of opinion) for the activities of the pirates and gave stringent instructions to the Political Residem to avoid involving himself in any way with the Wahabi power. 19. The Wahabi Lieutenant in Baraimi, Syed bin Mutlak, proceeded to Nejdi 1813, whereupon his successor, Ibn Azdakah, was murdered by the Beni Yas o Dhafrah. On Syed bin Mutlak's return later in the same year, he was himsel •.1,445, killed in action against the Hajriyin of Oman, and was succeeded by Ibn Mazr u ' 0 ' • In 1813, and again in 1814, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Aba Dhabi, who appears to have been more independent of Wahabi inHuence than the Jowasimis, on two occasions combined with Muscat against the Wahabis. In the autumn of 1814 the Wahabi Amir associated himself with explanations and assurances furnished by the de facto Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima to the Resident in regard to the piracies of the Jowasimis, consequent on which a preliminary agreement, immediately violated by the Jowasimis, was reached in October 1814.

The Wahabis assisted the Sheikhs to regain possession of Bahrein from Muscat in 1801, but the islands thereupon came under the influence of the Wahabi Amir, to whom they offered tribute in 1803, and with whom they co-operated L that year and again in 1805 against Muscat.

The Sultan of Muscat subsequently claimed that Bahrein had then accepted a liability to pay tribute to him, and in 1816 he made an attack upon the islands which, thanks to the assistance of the Wahabis, with whom and with the Jowasimis the Sheikhs now again allied themselves, was, however unsuccessful.

Despite the fact that the Wahabis were suspected of kbi,. being the moving force behind the activities of the Jowasimis, the instructions e Jowasimji gi vei1 1° the Resident were to refrain from proceedings which might be displeasing to the Wahabi Amir.

In the course of 1813, on a Wahabi envoy to Muscat announcing his arriva at that place to the Government of Bombay with the object of restoring 'tlie relations of amity between the two powers, 1 ' the Governor of Bombay wrote in reply : ' Entertaining, as I have always done, the most friendly disposition towards your master, I conceived it my duty even previously to the receipt of your letter to instruct Mr. Bruce, the British Resident at Bushire, to communicate with His Highness Sand bin Abdul Aziz, and to establish such an amicable intercourse witi him as cannot fail to be equally advantageous to both countries as well as for tie general benefit of their respective neighbours,-and it is with feelings of particular satisfaction I observe Your Excellency has stated that a corresponding desire i sincerely entertained by His Highness Saud bin Abdul Aziz, and I shall therefore look forward with confidence to the speedy attainment of our reciprocal wishes.

In the same year, however, Bahrein repudiated the agreement of 1831 and maintained itself against the Amir, whose coast it blockaded, until 1836, when peace was made. It is recorded in 1830 b 0 g e i that, while pretending to be free and independent, 'Turki had agreed, and XXIV, 439. continued, to pay a small annual tribute to Mehemet Ali Pasha, who approved of e ^ rlt , his proceedings which he took care to represent in a favourable light.' r close 1 3076 c their Ff1' n 8 38.

In 1840 the Egyptians again withdrew from Hasa, leaving the puppet Amir Khalid as its tributary Governor. 39. The principal events in the relations between the Wahabi Amirs and Hll Government and the rulers of Eastern Arabia during this period are describe! below. Wahabi Relations with Muscat, 1824-1840. 40. Between 1824 and 1830 the Sultan of Muscat was principally busied with unsuccessfu] endeavours to reduce the Sheikhs of Bahrein. In 1^29 he suffered 3 severe defeat at the hands of the Bahreinis and made peace with them. In 1831 Lor. 1, 1096. in the hope of forwarding his designs in Bahrein, he sent an embassy with presents to the Wahabi Amir. 41. In 1833 the Sultan, with the encouragement of the Government of India made a general agreement with the Wahabis, by which he undertook to pav a Lor. I, 456. zakat of 5,000 dollars a year. A condition of the agreement was that each should hold possession of his coast according to the limits then existing ; the Muscat coast extending to Jaalan, and the coast of the Amir to Qatif. Reciprocal assistance was also promised in putting down rebellion. There is nothing to show for how 1 the tribute continued to be paid. 42. No other events of importance affecting Muscat took place until 1839. In face of the Egyptian invasion and the threat which is constituted to Eastern Arabia, the Sultan of Muscat, with a view to promoting his designs in Bahrein, which he had never abandoned, was then at first disposed to co-operate with the Egyptians, but Lor. I, 457. on becoming aware of the hostility to Egyptian advance of the British Government, he associated himself with the views of the latter and refused a demand for assistance made upon him by the Egyptian Commander in Nejd. Wahabi Relations with Trucial Oman, 1824-1840. Wahabi Overtures, 1824. 43. Immediately on the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824, the Wahabi Amir opened correspondence with all the feheikhs of the coast, inviting them to renew the relations which had existed prior to the overthrow of the Wahabis by Ibrahim Fasha.

In May 1830, consequent on the defeat of the Beni Khalid of Hasa, the !e with [i vahabi Amir and his policy became a matter of acute importance in Trucial Oman. sentaii p'he bulk of the Jowasimis, and especially the Sheikhs of Ajman and Umm al Bo.

The Sheikh of Shargah, who had in 1821 abjured Wahabi wastbts )ue . ts ' I10 ^ v ' while outwardly professing sympathy with the Wahabis, wrote to the s %; fe|;' es ^ ent i n 1830, 'expressing his earnest desire to co-operate with the British eciprocalass' overnment ^.checking their.further progress, and went so far as to declare that gtoshowfe e was determined to oppose them even in the event of his not receiving any npport.' In reply he was informed that the British Government were solely aterested in the suppression of piracy and could not interfere in the internal 'k place ratil {fairs of the Arab States. But the Wahabi Amir soon made it clear that he was tutedtoEasfeot prepared to encourage any revival of piracy, and that he proposed to look upon Bahrein, wli he Sheikh of Shargah and the Sultan of Muscat as the heads of all the Arabian T ith tlieEgjp-ibes in Oman. The Sheikh of Ajman, who had asked for a body of troops to Lor -^ 688 ' heBritisi(knable him to throw off his dependence on Shargah, or even to attain the refused a fcscendancy in Shargah territories, and who had also suggested that he should 'ejd. ruise against the enemies of the Wahabis in the Gulf, met with a refusal on the ground inter alia that the English being the masters of the sea, the Wahabi Amir yas not able to contend with so powerful a nation.

By 1833 the Wahabi ruler had established his influence throughout the e MDis Crucial Coast, and in that year a direct demand by the Resident on the Sheikh of rith to i! lhargah for redress for a piracy led to an intemperate letter from the Wahabi [ttempt to lieutenant at Baraimi to the Residency Agent at Shargah. As* the Wahabi it.'

The Wahabi representative replied XXIV, 442, jedings, ^hat Amir Turki ' was now the only authority on the continent of Arabia, and that nment, )oth citizens and Bedouins, maritime as well as inland tribes, having all icknowledged his supremacy, he was in fact the ruler of the country, including . . ,ji9|.! ; ^ a i ar ' Oman, and the coast from Jaalan to Qatif, and that, therefore, on the 1 - Occurrence of any piracy it should be reported to the Wahabi Chief, or, in the iculties arc ;c)vent of his being at too great a distance, to his Agent at Baraimi.' tlic had apP arfE Dhabi submits to the Wahabis, 1833. jfall of tfe 1 47, Later in the same year the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was murdered by his ' 1 ' mother, who, anxious to consolidate his position, tendered his allegiance and an Dhak^ annual payment of tribute to the Wahabi Amir, The Amir in return informed aI . had ta^hargah that Abu Dhabi was under his protection and that he would permit of no Bo - SeL ^he Kesi^'ession upon them. Despite this, and the very categorical assertion of suzerainty heikh oi^|^ er f ec | to in paragraph 46 above, the threats of the Wahabi representative at Baraimi proved insufficient to overawe Shargah, and in 1834 peace was concluded ^between Shargah and Abu Dhabi, one condition of which was that Debai should Lor.

The Wababis about this time were still blockaded by the Sheikh of Bahrei and called in the assistance of Shargah against the Sheikhs of that island. On the murder in 1834 of Amir Turki this question, however, dropped, and the effect the murder is stated to have introduced such confusion and discord into Wahak affairs as to counteract the operation of any ambitious views of late entertain by the murdered chief, and for a time, at least, to leave the maritime tribes in same relative position as before.' In 1836 the preponderating influence of Meheme; Ali in the west began to afford a salutary check on Wahabi encroachments towards the coast of the Persian Gulf. In that year the AVahabi agent at Baraimi failed to secure the maritime assistance of Muscat and the coastal tribes against Bahrein and by 1838 the Wahabis had lost Baraimi to the local tribe of the Beni Nairn though in what circumstances is not clear. Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1824-1840. 49. In 1830-31 Bahrein, apprehensive of a coalition between the Wahahi Ami: and the Sultan of Muscat, who had made overtures to the Wahabis with a view securing Wahabi support in the reduction of Bahrein, formally submitted to tk Wahabi Amir, acknowledged his supremacy and undertook to pay tribute. 1833, however, the Sheikhs of Bahrein felt sufficiently strong to defy the Amir and between 1834 and 1836 they blockaded the coast of Hasa and caused sufficien inconvenience to the Wahabis to lead the latter to call in the assistance (which was not, in fact, accorded) of the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah. In 1836, however, alarmed by indications of an active assertion of the Persian claim and by possibility of a coalition between Muscat and Persia, Bahrein reached a friendli agreement with the Amir, under which the Sheikh was to pay a nominal tribute 2,000 dollars, while the Amir undertook to supply troops for the defence of Bahrein against external attacks, and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh for inariDr transport in the event of a Wahabi attack on Muscat by sea. In 1839 the Wahali Lor. 1, 1098. general, Umr bin Ufeysan, took refuge at Bahrein on the fall of the Amir FeisuL Qatar and the Wahabis, 1824-1840. 50. Little of moment happened in Qatar between 1824 and 1840. During muct of this period the authority of the Sheikh of Bahrein was paramount. In 1835 Lor. I, 857. the people of Huwailah rebelled against Bahrein and entered into correspondence with the Wahabis. A settlement was, however, reached by the mediation of son of the Sultan of Muscat. Koweit and the Wahabis, 1824-1840. 51. Ihe solidarity of the Uttabi rulers of Koweit with those of Bahrein anil Qatar was apparently maintained throughout this period. Koweit continued' 1006-10 on the whole successfully, and latterly under the protection of the Turks, t enorts of the Wahabi Amirs to incorporate it with their dominions. During t ^gjptian occupation of Hasa in 1838-40 an Egyptian agent was appointed Aoweit and appears to have remained there during the period of Egypti^ ascendancy. H .M.

Resident but Colonel Pelly reached the conclusion that it was open to question whether the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, in the support he had given to the Chief of Rostack, was acting under instructions from the ahabi Amir, ^transpired that the differences which had arisen had a two-fold aspect. the lust the rebellion of the Chief of Rostack ; the second and more important, a demand on the part of the Wahabi Amir for an increased annual tribute fiom tiie ouitan, coupled with a threat of invasion in the event of non-compliance. 67. In August 1865 the Beni ba Ali and the Jenabah tribes of south-east Muscat, both of them Wahabi by religion, captured bur, inflicting considerable damage on British Indian subjects. A protest was at once made to the AA ahabi Amir and to his deputy at Baraimi on behalf of the British Government and the Resident was authorised to take, in consultation with the Senior Naval Officer, such measuies as they might think likely to promote an arrangement between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan.

Phe discussions wbict subsequently took place were unfruitful It proved necessary to bombard and destroy the forts of Sur, and to destroy a Wahabi tower at Ajman and certain Wahabi warships which were lying at Qatif; and the Wahabi Amir, faced witt these evidences of a positive British intention to support the Sultan of Muscat anc to secure reparation for the injuries which had been inflicted, sent an envoy to Bushire early in 1866, who requested the Resident, on behalf of the Amir, to mediate between the Amir and the British Government, and gave undertakings that no attack would be made upon British subjects residing in territories under the authority of the Amir or upon the territories ' of the Arab tribes in alliance witli the British Government, especially of the Kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zakat that has been customary of old.

In October 1841, on the Amir Khalid threatening to send a force into Oman, a British officer was deputed to inform him, both orally and in writing, that 11.M. Government would disapprove of such a measure. The Amir disavowed any intention of adopting it and would apparently in any event have lacked the force to give effect to it. This was perhaps as well, ' as the maritime Arab chiefs though outwardly professing their determination to maintain their independence, were known to be secretly carrying on intrigues and correspondence with him.' Overtures of the Amir Ahdulla to the Trucial Sheikhs, 1842. 70. In February 1842 the Amir Abdulla addressed letters to the Sheikhs ot Oman intimating his intention of sending Sa'ad bin Mutlak as his deputy to then and requesting them to afford him every aid and assistance. The originals of these letters (save in the case of Abu Dhabi, where the Sheikh refused to surrender the letter addressed to him) were obtained by the Political Resident, Colonel Robertson, who thereupon formally protested to the Wahabi Amir against his attempt to briiU the 1 rucial Sheikhdoms under Wahabi influence, on the ground of the ill -effects which had hitherto resulted 'from the establishment of Wahabi interests araoi^ the pirate chieftains, which had led to their chastisement by the British Government. Ihe Amir, in reply, declared his intention of co-operating with the British Government to stamp out piracy and added that he had promulgated this to the people of Oman, whom he referred to as his subjects. The correspondence droppf a with the overthrow of the Amir Abdulla in May-June of 1842, but it maybe noted that in their published reply to the letters received from the Amir, the kdieikhs of Baraimi claimed a species of connection with the British Governme^ (no doubt based on the encouragement given them in 1839—paragraph 59 above, although there was reason to believe that secret letters of a different tenour had also been despatched to the Amir by the Wahabi partisans among them.15 ^ 0 Pen to 1(: igivenii- Overtures of the Amir Feisul to the Trucial Sheikhs, 1843.

In I853 the Government of Bombay were authorised to afford every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabis (who were now nominally subject to the Turkish Government). In 1859 a Wahabi attack was again averted by British intervention, but the Amir formally asserted his authority over Bahrein, declaring that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey (see paragraphs 91 and 105 below); in 1801 it proved necessary to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh to discontinue a blockade of the Wahabi ports which he had instituted, and, later in the same year, to take forcible action for the removal of the Bahreini pretender from Qatar despite the support accorded to him by the Wahabis. Koweit and the Wahabis, 1840-1870. 89. In 1841 the ex-Amir Khalid took refuge in Koweit. In 1863 relations between the Sheikh of Koweit and the then Wahabi Amir were friendly, but no tribute was paid to the Wahabis. In 1866 the Wahabi Amir, ' who maintained an agent at Koweit for political purposes, as his father too had done even so early as 1851. 1 'was prepared to assist the Sheikh in a quarrel between the latter and the Turks. The Wahabis and Turkey, 1840-1870. Wahabi Tribute to Turkey. 90. In 1862 the Consul-General at Bagdad stated that since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1839-40 ' Amir Feisul has remained tributary to the Tnrldst authorities at Mecca, his tribute being regarded probably as an offering- to the head of the religion.' Amir professes to be a Turkish Dependent, 1855. Turkish Claim to Suzerainty, 1862. 91. In 1841 the Porte, having received presents from the puppet Amir Khalid advanced claims to authority over Islejd and appointed him Wali of Nejd on their behalf. In-1851 the Amir was understood to pay tribute to the Porte, despite tb fact that accredited envoys of the Pasha of Egypt were present in his camp aiic the Wahabi agent at Koweit professedly supporled Egyptian interests.'' In ISoa (see paragraph 105 below) the Amir stated in terms, in writing, that he was?, dependent of the J urkish Government and that the dependence of Nejd 011 Turkey a jeen made cleai to Mehemet Ali in 1839. In 1859, again in writing, lif reierred to treaties between Nejd and the Porte (paragraph 106 below).

In October 1841 the Government of Bombay deputed a British officer to In jg| visit Khalid at his camp in Hasa, consequent on rumours that he contemplated the rere fn e v invasion of Oman. He gave satisfactory guarantees that he had no such intention. 'whonit: 96. In 1842 overtures made to the Trucial Sheikhs by the Amir Abdulla, who Lor. 1,1108. ione evenhad overthrown Khalid in February 1842, drew a formal protest from the Resident. e D thelafetn 1843 the Amir Feisul, having overthrown the Amir Abdulla, intimated to the Irucial and inland Sheikhs of Oman that he proposed to bring that area under his authority. British Assistance refused to Beni Nairn of Baraimi, 1843. 97. The Chiefs of Baraimi thereupon in November 1843 applied for the aid of the British Government. They were informed in reply that ' the communications since tie^ ormer ^y entered into with them by the British Government had reference solely lutarytolfito the advance of the Egyptian troops and the connection subsisting between H.H. Muhammad Ali Pasha with Nejd, but that these circumstances being now altogether changed and the impending danger removed by the departure of the troops under Khurshid Pasha from that province, it was now the intention of the British Government to withdraw from all interference in the internal affairs of Arabia.' Overtures hy Amir Feisal, 1843. 98. At about the same time the Wahabi Amir on his side informed the Resident aiToBV [) f k* 8 anx i et y ; fo r renewal of the amicable relations which had formerly existed [e Porte, te between his father, Turki, and the British Government. An appropriate response entinlii- was ma ^ e to communication, and the Amir was also informed that the sole ; i]r , . object of the British iiovernment in this quarter was the suppression of plunder ■ iU i and bloodshed on the seas and the security of all well-disposed inhabitants on the cfNS&gt; hores of the Gulf - rain in ^ Policy of Government of India and Government of Bombay, 1843-1845. 99. The Government of Bombay, having at about this time suggested doubts as on tkf to whether the Wahabi Amir should be allowed to obtain a preponderating influence ^ejd,' it®at Bahrein and over the Arab chiefs who were in treaty relations with H.M. apli 108 ^Government, were informed by the Government of India that it was 'not at present necessary or expedient to interfere with the proceedings of the Chief.' 100. The Government of Bombay reverted to the subject on 26th August 1844, lyisl^and pointed out that in the ' now certain event of the Amir Feisal, the legitimate niisb* Wahabi Ruler, extending his authority over the chiefs of Oman, and especially if offieiaif he endeavoured to effect this object by sea,' British relations with Oman and the ^ gimaritime Arab Chiefs might be affected and the resumption of piracy facilitated, jj^issd; 5 They suggested the possibility of an arrangement with the Amir ratifying and Jtli^ 1 securing existing engagements at sea; 'In other words, that as the price of ! o | ]].. forbearance on the part of the British Government this chief should become a nee ba^T )art y to mar i t i me engagements, whereby commercial interests may be secured.' a ^ f.The Government of India took no action on this suggestion. liiiac ■ 101. Early in 1845, consequent on the re-establishment of the Wahabi Agent ■xteDtfe'l^ ara i m i and his inroads into Muscat, the Bombay Government again consulted ^pende- Government of India as to the action to be taken if Muscat asked for British Quiiitnl help against the Wahabis. The Government of India replied that if 'the mere establishment of the Wahabi power in Oman and the reception of the willing allegiance of the maritime chiels, whom, on a former occasion, we took under our erea| ter ; protection and encouraged to resistance, were to be the only result of the present outi' expedition . . . the Governor-General in Council would see no occasion to modify tliatfr 0 the opinion given in the letter from this office of 7th October 1843, that our 3076 P Bo.

Nejd Precis, §56.( 20 interference is not called for.' 1 If, however, the Amir's purposes appeared to be to encroach on Muscat, or if ' the result of these proceedings is found detrirnenj to our relations with the maritime Arabs and our measures for the suppressio Of piracy,' a case for interference would arise, and in such an event it m'mh be desirable that the Government of Bombay should warn the Amir that our forbearance would be extended no farther. Such an expression of the vier of the British Government would probably be sufficient to cause him to desist from active operation against Muscat. At any rate, a demonstration by sea b the British naval forces would produce the desired effect. If the Government of Bombay considered ' that the mere declaration of our views or naval operations alone would in all probability effect what is desired ' they were ai veil discretion to proceed accordingly. Otherwise, they should refer for further instructions to the Government of India. A strong naval demonstration was subsequently made, and forcible remonstrances addressed by the Political Resident both to the Amir and to his Lieutenant at Baraimi resulted in the conclusion of an understanding between Muscat and the Amir. 102. In 1846 the Wahabi Amir was refused permission by the Government of Inuia to borrow aid against Bahrein from Trucial Oman, a correspondino' remuxt Lor. 1, 881. from Bahrein being likewise refused. ^ j Bahrein supported against Wahabis, 1851.

In 1859, the Wahabi Amir threatening to support the Balireini pretender, L If the Muhammad bin Abdulla, against the de facto chief, the Persian Gulf Squadron .^r was despatched to Bahrein, with the result that the Wahabi Governor of Qatif wed'tli e j t .' abandoned his designs and begged for pardon.

The Resident replied that the British Government recognised Bahrein as an independent Sheikhdom and was prepared to oppose all foreign agency, including that of H.H. the Amir, by every means in its power. He added that the Amir's claim to be a dependant of Turkey w T as inconsistent with the piracies which were at the same time being committed by his Lieutenant interveDiioi at Qatif on vessels bearing the Turkish flag. Bombardment of Damman, 1861. 1852. 107. In June 1861 the Amir was required to eject the Bahreini pretender from iir, enterir I-^amman in Qatar, and was advised to enter into a peaceful convention with the naiitimei rulin g Sheikh. No answer having been returned, the Persian Gulf Squadron forcibly compelled the Pretender to flee from Da mm an in November 1861. The Wahabi garrisons took no steps to molest the Squadron. Turkish Protest and British Reply, 1862. 108. A Turkish protest against the bombardment of Damman—a place which, Ne - d p r6eis as lying within the territory of ' Feisul Beg, the Kaimakham of Nejd,' ' was part of § 67. the hereditary dominions of the Sultan '—was received from the Turkish WaH dent Powi of Bagdad at the end of 1861. The British Consul-General at Bagdad replied that i depends! H.M. Government had hitherto always maintained direct relations with Amir Sultan tor Feisul as well as with all the chiefs and principalities situated on the shores of the when lie Persian Gulf.' In the prosecution of our pacific policy in the Gulf, which was dearer® well known, we 'have never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of any yests inrK other State—an authority and jurisdiction, moreover, which assuredly the Porte )ia and to fit neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter.' The Consul-General, i depends in reporting the correspondence to the Ambassador at Constantinople, remarked : Ba dad to it effect, let' 'Although it may not be denied that since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in Const! ponwarki 1839-40 Amir Feisul has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, 1.1.62.' ereofdolp his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion, it is rejoiced ^ certain that the Porte has never exercised any jurisdiction or attempted to extend ^ ttefflioe its authority over that country. ... In point of fact the Porte has not the power to punish or coerce its tributary; not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country, and to judge from my own experience of the duties of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, I feel assured that, were the relations of that officer with the mlarities Amir oj Nejd to be disturbed in a manner to withdraw the Wahabi coast from his nfrement^ immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudicial to the policy which (rone W h as hitherto obtained under the orders and' sanction of Her Majesty's Indian ,: Government in that quarter.'

Colonel Felly's Visit to the Wahabi Amir. P.R. to Bo., 14.2.65. Bo. to S. of S., No. 14, 28.3.65, para. 3. 110. In February 1865 Colonel Felly decided to visit the Wahabi Amir at M capital. This visit is of some importance, as Ibn Saud has tended to suggest (both recently, in 1911 (paragraph 148 below) and in 19 L3 (paragraph 152 below) that an agreement (in 1911 alleged to have been oral) was reached between Colonel Felly and his ancestor on this occasion. It may, therefore, be recorded P.R to Bo., that the Resident's visit, though subsequently formally approved ? by both the 8.465 ' Government of Bombay and the Government of India, was undertaken on his own initiative and without any previous reference to or sanction of either Government' and that the Resident had no instructions on the basis of which he could have conducted negotiations. The Despatch reporting that he was proceeding to Riyadh lemaiks : I hope that I shall leave the Wahabi Frovinces on polite terms 'with Lor. 1,1118- the people, and with the prospect of more friendly relations with the Wahabi Government. It is possible, also, I may find an opportunity for a casual and friendly office towaids smoothing the present differences between the Sultan nf Muscat and the Wahabis.' No Agreement concluded with the Amir. 111. Colonel Felly's report on his visit makes it clear that there was no discussion with the Amir regarding the conclusion of any treaty or understandins, 1 owards the end of the visit, however, the Amir's Secretary (elsewhere described as a frivolous and vindictive mongrel') intimated that he (the Secretary) 'was veiy desirous that I should enter into some treaty whereby the Arabs of Oman, ■ 'j. the ! er ® lau Gulf should be exempted from our slave piracy (sic) ■ and receive from us the same consideration which we had accorded to the Sultan of Zanzibar m entering into a treaty with His Highness confirmatory of the slave ra - e * secretary added that he was empowered by the Amir to offer an exchange treaty binding him to prevent the Arabs of Oman and the Gulf from committing depredations or injuring our telegraph establishments.

From the Fall of Baraimi and the Turkish Occupation of Hasa enrov to the Capture of Riyadh by Ibn Saud. Abortive Wahabi Plans to recover Baraimi, 1870-1871, at olr 124. It is unnecessary for the purpose of the matters now specially under interfeif consideration to examine the history of this period in any very great detail, a flj.j Suffice it to say that in 1870-71 active steps were in contemplation by the Wahabi c: , s j Amirs for the restoration of Baraimi, which at one time caused some apprehension . , t to the Government of India and to the Trucial Sheikhs. In 1870 the Trucial Sheikhs, having been approached by the Wahabi Amir with a view to an attack P.R. to Bo., I on the fort, returned conciliatory answers, with the exception of Abu Dhabi. The 10.2.70. l : internecine quarrels of the Wahabi ruling family, closely followed by a Turkish ^• of *- to expedition into Nejd in 1870 to assist the Amir Abdulla against his brother Saud, ^esp 17 led to the abandonment of the prosecution of the war against Oman.

It may, however, be recorded that in 1870 the Amir Abdulla, having ' , ^ been defeated by his brother, himself appealed to the Turks, with the result that a Turkish expedition occupied Hasa in 1871. In the same year the Turks ceased, even in appearance, to act on behalf of the Amir Abdulla, and a notification was issued that the ' El Saud has ceased to reign ' and that a Turkish official was Pr ® cis ' Kir 1 1 '; appointed Governor of Nejd, and the Amir Abdulla fled to Riyadh. ^ 0 ' Wahabi Appeals to Great Britain, 1871-1873. ^ 126. In September of 1871, Saud bin Feisal protested to the Political Resident mi against the activities of the Turks in the Gulf waters. He urged, that the peace of Secret those waters was under British protection and begged for British arbitration, a Proceedings, , request which was refused. Between 1871 and 1873 no fewer than four letters Mar. 1872, ' were received by the Resident from Saud, in which he represented that he had 249,252, 1 ' ' been 'easy as regards the sea coast in reliance to your answer, the sea being in 257 ' 2o9 ^ 66 - your charge and protection. . . . The sea is under charge of the Resident, and I was careless about the sea owing to his word.' . . . 'The Sircar' ... is 1:1,1 'bound to keep peace.' The Government of India informed the acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, with reference to these letters, that unless Saud ' was a party r 1 to the so-called maritime truce or had otherwise received assurances from the British Government he was mistaken in supposing that the British Government had undertaken to protect his territories from attack by sea.' The Resident was p^ ret ,j- instructed to report whether anything had been said or done at any time to OctTs^'' commit the British Government, directly or indirectly, to defend him or to use No. 441. their influence to prevent attacks being made upon him by sea. The report when received showed that Saud was not a party to the maritime truce and that the British Government had in no way been committed to protecting him by sea. Later communications from Saud showed that he now understood the position and Nejd Precis, merely hoped for the good wishes and friendship of the British Government, and it § 144-9. was left to the Resident in these circumstances to answer Saud's latest letter, either then or afterwards, in general terms, expressive of goodwill. 'Should he again I26 refer to the existence of any such assurance of security matters were to be explained to him in such a way as to remove any existing misunderstanding which he might display and prevent the possibility of misunderstanding in the future.' Amir Saud and the Turks, 1872-1873. 127. A brief reference may be made to the relations between Saud and the Turks as bearing on the question of the relation of the Saudi dynasty to the Turkish Nejd Precis, power. In 1872 it was reported that the terms of the understanding contemplated §150-6. were to be his recognition as the Chief of Nejd on condition of his paying the Turkish war expenses and the same yearly tribute as had been paid by the Amir Feisnl. There were certain supplementary conditions which are immaterial. Both he and the Turks professed their anxiety for a settlement on this basis, but no conclusion was reached. In 1872 a letter from Saud offered to invest the Resident with full power of mediation with the Turks, but the negotiations which succeeded again came to no conclusion. In 1873 Saud, now in a stronger position in Nejd, sent Abdul Rahman, the father of the present Saudi King, to Bagdad, with a view to the reaching of an agreement. Abdul Rahman was treated as a hostage and Pol. A. detained until 1874, but negotiations proved unfruitful. In 1875 Saud died and Sept. 1875, Abdul Rahman was elected Amir of the kingdom of Riyadh ' by the general consent of the people.' Internecine quarrels between members of the Saudi family continued from 1875 to 1880, but in the latter year it was reported that Abdulla and his nephews (including Abdul Rahman) were living in peace and friendship. The nephews possessed Kharj, Hotah, Harik, Aflaj, &amp;c., and had followers of the Ajman, Murra and Dowasir tribes. Rise of the Ihn Rashid Family. 128. In 1881, however, the Ibn Rashid dynasty, assisted by the divisions among the Saudis, gradually established themselves in control in Nejd, and the Saudis, who in 1879 had been reported to exercise control only in Riyadh and the district round it, sank into obscurity for 20 years. The Ibn Rashid dynasty of Hail had from 1832 occupied the Jebel Shammar and its Sheikhs had paid homage to the Nejd Precis, Saudis. The homage to the Saudis was gradually abandoned with the decay of § 201. the Wahabi State, and in 1876 Ibn Rashid is described as the greatest prince iu Nejd.' In 1888 Ibn Rashid decisively defeated the Saudis and captured Riyadh, and his dynasty remained in complete control in Nejd until 1901. It may be recorded, however, that in 1890-91, on the Saudis regaining Riyadh, both parties Nejd Precis, wrote to the Mutasarrif of Hasa, Ibn Rashid to denounce Abdnl Rahman as §217. meditating an attack on Hasa; Abdul Rahman complaining of Ibn Rashid 'and Extl. A; professing his obedience to the Turkish authorities, who were disposed to listen 40 O _9 18 Feb f avoura bly to him.' The Ibn Rashid family throughout professed allegiance to the 1891, 63-4 Turkish Government, though Turkish influence in their dominions appears to have been of the smallest; and even on the occasion of his capture of Riyadh in 1888 Ibn Rashid posed as the officer or lieutenant of the Ottoman Government. ■ Consolidation of British Position on the Arab Littoral of the Gulf, 1870-1901. 129. Between 1870 and 1901 H.M. Government had substantially strengthened their position on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. In 1880 they had entered into an exclusive agreement with the Sheikhs of Bahrein ; in 1887 corresponding agreements were concluded with the Trucial Sheikhs. In 1892 the agreements both with Bahrein and with the Trucial Sheikhdoms were confirmed and strengthened and control of the foreign relations of all the rulers in question passed into the hands of the British Government. Muscat, which had entered into a revised Commercial Treaty with Great Britain in 1891, in 1899 agreed never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Govern ment, any portion of its territories—an understanding which had at an earlier stage been secured from the Trucial Sheikhs and Bahrein. In 1899 the British Government for the first time established relations on the basis of a positive written engagement with the Sheikh of Koweit and laid the foundations of the situation which emerged 14 years later in the acknowledgment by Turkey under the Anglo -Turkish Convention of 1913 of the autonomy of the Sheikhs of that principality. Turkey established herself in Qatar in 1871 and remained in control throughout the period 1871-1901. Her claim to the principality was never recognised by H.M. Government, and considerable correspondence with the Turkish Government took place during this period in connection with it.iv.— 1901-1914. From the Capture of Riyadh by Ibn Saud to the outbreak of the Great War. ftotW g COltfij Hspsjil lidkl stielg iicl m mm 130, Between 1901 and 1913 Ibn Smid considerably reduced the importance of the Ibn Rashid family and established himself in Nejd. In 1913 he drove the Turkish garrisons out of Rasa. During almost the whole of this period he was in frequent contact with H.M. Government, his object being to secure their protection against the Turks. It may perhaps be well, in the interests both of ilhistratW the terms which he was prepared to offer in return for British protection and of placing on record the various statements made by him during this period as to his maximum ambitions, his attitude towards the area to the east of the Neid-Hasa border, and to the States of the Arab littoral, and his view of his position vis-d-vis the Turks, to record in greater detail than would otherwise be justifiable the sequence of events and the more important correspondence which passed. 131. In January 1901 Ibn Saud took Tbn Rashid by surprise and conquered Riyadh. He appears to have made overtures to the Political Resident late in 1903 with a view to ascertaining whether he could look for British protection in the event of his conquering Hasa. The Government of India thereupon took up the question of sending a European officer to Riyadh for the purpose of collecting intelligence. They were instructed by H.M. Government that no steps should betaken to enter into closer relations with Nejd or to send an Agent there without prior sanction, and in the light of the Resident's views, which were also hostile, they did not proceed with the proposal. Ihn Saud appeals for British Protection, 1904. 132. In May 1904, on the Turks taking active steps to support Ibn Rashid, a protest against the Turkish invasion was received from Ibn Saud, who solicited the Y ic tel protection of Great Britain for his country and himself. No answer seems to have 20.5.04. been given to these overtures, which were made through the Political Resident. Influence of Abu Dhahi in the Hinterland of the Trucial Coast, 1904. 133. The Political Resident in June 1904 drew attention to the preponderating influence which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi had recently been exercising in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and referred to the fact that the Sheikh had 28 O 6 04 concluded agreements with the inland Bedouin tribes such as the Beni Khatab, Ghofleh, Khavater, &amp;c.

Abdur Rahman takes Oath of Allegiance to Turkey, 1905. 137. In May 1905 it was reported that Riyadh, Washem, Sedayr and their dependencies had been formed into a caza of which the centre was to be Riyadh and that Ibn Saud's father had been made Kaimakan of the new caza on solemnly taking an oath of allegiance to the Sultan. Projected Visit hy Ihn Saud to Trucial Coast, 1905-1906. 138. Towards the end of 1905 information was received that Ibn Saud had visited Katr (still nominally under Turkish rule) and composed certain tribal disputes there, and that he was meditating a visit to the Trucial Coast and to Muscat. This news had seriously disturbed the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who had himself been instrumental in the final extinction of Wahabi influence from Baraimi and the Trucial Coast in 1870, and the Sultan of Muscat, both of whom (with the Sheikh of Dabai) belonged to the Hinawi tribe and feared that the arrival of Ibn Saud would be the signal for a combination against them of the remaining Trucial Chiefs who belonged to the Ghafari tribe. Ibn Saud, moreover, was reported to have remarked ' By God, I will explore the country belonging to my father and grandfather from Muscat to Jaalan.' Views of Government of India and TI.M. Government. 139. The Government of India were seriously disturbed as to the possible effect on our position on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat of a visit by Ibn Saud. H.M. Government in the light of their views decided after consultation with the Ambassador at Constantinople that if Ibn Saud appeared on the coast and failed to give satisfactory assurances as to his intentions, he should be warned that any attempt on his part to interfere in Oman or along the Arab coast, either with the Chiefs or with their subjects, would be regarded as an unfriendly act and that steps would be taken to frustrate it. Before these instructions were received, Sir Percy Cox had conveyed a hint in this sense to Ibn Saud through the Sheikh of Koweit (who regarded the proposed visit as a mere attempt to blackmail the coastal C hiefs). The visit, probably owing to the unsettled situation in Nejd, was abandoned. It should be recorded that, on the instructions of H.M. Government, the Truciai Sneikhs were in the same connection warned by the Resident that, on the ground that general unrest prejudicial to British commercial interests on the C oast would inevitably result, the Government of India would not view with complacency the intrigues of any of them with Ibn Saud. Defeat of Ihn Rashid, May 1906. 140. In May 1906 Ibn Rashid and his immediate following of 250 were surprised and annihilated in Qasim by Ibn Saud, and Ibn Saud was reported from Jedda in June of that year to have declared himself, consequent on his victory, riilei of the whole * Shark ' (East) and to have sent letters to Constantinople, asrah, Bagdad, the Hedjaz, and the Sherif of Mecca. Sir Nicholas O'Couor doubted, howeyei, whether Ibn Saud would be able .to cope with the Turks, ' should he decide to proclaim his independence of the Sultan.' Turkish Alloicances to Ihn Saud. 141. In August 1906 the Consul at Basrah reported that the allowance granted by the lurks to Ibn Saud was by a recent arrangement paid through the Sheikh of Ivoweit who deducted it from the land tax on his Fao property The Sheikh stated that the allowances paid by the Turks were 90 liras a month to Ibn Sand 's father and 200 liras and about 300 tons of rice to Ibn Rashid.

In September 1906 inconclusive negotiations took place between the p %: Turkish Commander of Qasim and Ibn Sand, and at the end of that year most ,1Ilst ¥ of the Turkish troops were reported to have been withdrawn from Qasim, a step 27.12.06 which was regarded as a definite success for Ibn Sand. Se^ | Further Overtures hy Ihn Saud to EM. Government, 1906. was tol^f 143. As stated above, no reply was sent to the overtures made to H.M. ffcazan; Government on behalf of Ibn Sand in 1904. Further indirect approaches having been made through various channels during 1906 with a view to ascertaining whether H.M. Government would be prepared to give him protection at any rate by , seaio the same extent as it was accorded to the Sheikh of Koweit and other Arab ' ' Rulers of the Gulf in the event of his driving the Turks out of Hasa and Nejd, the wki Political Resident in September raised the general question of policy. Major Cox Bre toh ^ cat said that he was aware that 'it has been a recognised principle of their (H.M. of L 2181 cialfe: Government's) policy not to allow themselves to become involved in the tempestuous 16 -9-06, uDkli, politics of Central Arabia,' but expressed the view that it might be unwise to carry P - 1817/06 - incefro® aloofness too far. He suggested that an understanding with Ibn Saud would be of fwbr advantage in various ways, and that if we had any intention 'of establishing some lat lie Jmeasnre of friendly intercourse with the Ruler of Nejd, the present seems to be the of tie j : time for us to do so.' y* : Attitude of H.M. Government, 1906. 144. Lord Morley, then Secretary of State for India, replied, however, that H.M. Government maintained the view that their interests and influence should be g confined to the coast, and that no steps should be taken to enter into relations with ' ' * Nejd or to send agents into the interior without his previous sanction. lie pit M 0 m m Further Overtures to H.M. Government, 1906. 145. Towards the end of 1906 further indirect overtures on behalf of Ibn Saud were received through the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikh of Qatar. The Resident reported that from the statements made by the latter it appeared that the Saud ' considers that the oases of Hasa and Katif were always the most profitable possessions of his Wahabi ancestors. He is anxious to recover the two districts and he proposes that a secret understanding should be arranged between the P R- to British Government and himself under which he should be granted British 241106 protection from Turkish assaults by sea in the event of his ever driving the Turks, p '2719/06 • unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protection the Amir 2.12.06, is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to those of the P- 2799/06. 'Crucial Chiefs) and to accept a Political Officer to reside at his Court. . . . Ibn Sand is determined to make an effort to obtain possession of Hasa and Katif. He proposes, therefore, in the first place, to apply to the Sultan for the Mutasariflik (Governorship) of the districts, and to throw off the Turkish yoke as soon as he considers the moment favourable, after establishing himself. If his application is refused he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready and having captured them will appeal openly to the British Government for protection.' Murder of Mutaad ihn Uashid, January 1907. 146. In January 1907 Muta'ad ibn Rashid, the young Amir of Hail, who had p. 2660/07. succeeded his father in the Principality of Jabel Shammar at Hail in September 1906, was murdered by his kinsman Sultan ibn Rashid. Further Consideration of Policy towards Ihn Saud, 1907. 147. On 21st February 1907 the Government of India, in the light of the Resident's reports, again raised the question of the policy to be adopted towards Ibn Saud. They suggested that if the Turks were really likely to disappear from the stage and Ibn Saud to be a power in the land, 'it seemed desirable that this Desp.No .28, Chief should, when a suitable moment arrives, be led to a friendly understanding 21 - 2 07 - with us.' But on a review of the various factors in the situation, they expressed the opinion that no immediate response to the advances reported by the Resident was necessary and that the answer to Ibn Sand's reiterated enquiries might be that30 H.M. Government, 'while anxious to maintain friendly relation^ with him so W as he comports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with the Arab Sheikhs on the coast, see no necessity under present conditions for making him any formal promises of protection, which might even have the effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to the consolidation of his authority.' 148. The Ambassador at Constantinople, Sir Nicholas p'Conor, thought tliat our right policy was ' to intervene as little as possible in the internal affairs of these Desp. No. 17 tribes and Jet them work out their own destiny as best they can,' to wait on events to G. of I., anc i to modify our policy if subsequently a closer understanding with Ibn Sand p 5 2 e 9 7 |s/07 seemed desirable. With this view H.M. Government agreed, and they instructed the Government of India that they saw no reason to modify their earlier policy that British interests and influence in this region should be strictly confined to the coast. If it was quite inevitable to give an answer to Ibn Sand's enquiries, the * answer should be that as Ibn Sand's proposals involved considerations which it was impossible for H.M. Government to entertain,.no reply was to be expected to them. Ihn Eashid is defeated and abandons Qasim, 1907-1908. 149. In October 1907 Ibn Rashid was decisively defeated by Ibn Sand and besieged by him in Boreida ; and in February 1908 Ibn Rashid entered into negotiations with Ibn Sand and abandoned Qasim to him. Ihn Saud settles Trihal Disputes in Rasa at request o/ Turks (1908). His ascendency in Nejd. 150. In May 1908 Ibn Saud was asked by the Turkish Wali of Basra to settle certain tribal differences in Hasa in the Arab way. In July of the same year Sultan Ibn Rashid, himself the murderer in April 1906 of Mita'ad Ibn Rashid, was murdered by his brother Saud, who succeeded as Amir and made overtures to Ibn Saud. But by September of that year the Consul at Damascus reported that Damascus to ' Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud has become practically the undisputed Amir of Nejd, with his ascendancy recognised in Riyadh, Qasim and by all the Bedouin tribes of Nejd. Even Saud Ibn Rashid himself admits that his Amirate of Hail is only a vassalage under the suzerainty of Ibn Saud.' In the same month Saud Ibn Rashid was overthrown, and the Amirate reverted to a minor under a Regency. But by January 1909 the Ibn Rashid faction had to some extent consolidated themselves. Ibn Saud and the Turks, July 1909. 151. In July 1909 Ibn Saud's agent at Bagdad, in the course of a discussion with the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, remarked that 'Abdul Aziz had thought of approaching the Sultan with the suggestion that he should fly the 1 urkish flag, pay a certain amount of tribute to the Turkish Government, and he recognised as the Governor of the whole of Arabia,' and had actually sent an emissary to take soundings, who had reached Basra, but had returned to Nejd on the news of the Young Turk coup d'etat of April 1909. Ibn Saud's object and that of many Arabs was Arab independence. If they could not secure this they would prefer the _ supremacy of a foreign Power to that of the Turks, and the emissary clearly indicated that the Power they had in view was the British Government. First Conversations between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear, 1911. 152.^ In the spring of 1911 conversations of much importance, though of a Bre. to G. of wholly informal character, took place between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear, '' ' ' ' ^h en 1 olitical Agent, Koweit. Captain Shakespear was the first European whom Ibn baud had met, and close personal relations appear at once to have been established between them. The Amir described his position and his ambitions in gieat detail. Ihe following extracts from Captain Shakespear's Report of the conversation are of interest as illustrating Ibn Saud's view as to the previous le ations or the Vv aliabi rulers with the British Government, his own relations with 1 in key and Ins attitude to the Trucial Shaikhs ;— t i • ir ^ le been expelled from Nejd, his ancestor, ur i- m-Abdulla, had re-created most of the original Wahabi dominion,, mc u mg Hasa, Katif and most of the Oman coast from Qatar to near Muscat ... and had then made a treaty with the British Government . .

He asserts that he had made no professions [at the time of an expedition against him in 1910 by the Sherif of Mecca] of being the vassal of the Sultan, and being a Wahabi does not admit the Sultan's Khalifate in Islam. . . . The As Saud . . . above all desired to be in relations with the British Government so that the Turkish Govern ment would hesitate to oppress them or to interfere in their affairs in Nejd. The new regime in Constantinople had already shown their aggressive policy and he feared that before very many years there would be another attempt to subjugate Nejd. Though the Wahabis had formerly fought us in regard to the coastal Chiefs affairs, they saw the benefit of our rule amongst them and had no wish to alter the present position, though A.bdul Aziz mentioned having received a letter from Dibai, whose Sheikhs had written, after the Hyacinth gun-running incident, asking to be taken under his protection. On enquiring how he reconciled the regular receipt of a Turkish annuity with the claim to absolute independence, Abdul Aziz said that the annuity dated from the^ time of his father's incarceration in Bagdad, was given theu for his living expenses, and has continued ever - since as personal to Abdul Rahman ; it amounts to only £T.60 per mensem. The As Saud have never received anything else from the Turks in the way of subsidies, and on his father's death Abdul Aziz proposes to allow his subsidy to lapse.' All the correspondence they had had with the Turkish officials has been of a diplomatic nature, either to effect the removal of troops on the pretext of a show of submission, or to settle any other difficulties as they arose.' 153. The question of policy was again considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office on the receipt of Captain Shakespear's report. It was agreed, however, that it seemed preferable to hold to the existing policy unless the Govern- ment of India should propose a departure from it, when the question could be again considered. ir, ^ .g y B ritish N egotiations with T urkey , 1911-1913. 154. Between 1911 and 1913 H .M. Government were engaged in negotiations with ^the Turkish Government on the various matters in dispute between them in in S ^ an Gulf area, which culminated in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of July 1913 (paragraph 165) and March 1914 (paragraph i79). Further meeting between Captain Shakespear and Ihn Saud, May 1913. 155. On 15th May 1913 Captain Shakespear, then Political Agent, Koweit, of reported that he had met Ibn Saud in the course of a recent tour, in the Koweit 26.5 13,' hinterland, and had spent four days with him. In the course of the visit p. 2448/13. Ibn Saud had discussed his future policy with great frankness with Captain fehakespear, who was in close personal relations with him. Captain Shakespear submitted a detailed report of his discussions, from which the following extracts, bearing on the matters now under discussion, are relevant;— . 156. He, Ibn Saud, according to Captain Shakespear, stated that '' his power m Central Arabia had increased till he no longer feared any of its Sheikhs or tU ol' was ' moreover &gt; i n alliance with all of them, excepting only one, viz. : Capt. !j e Sharif of Mecca, who, fearing a second Wahabi invasion of the Hejaz, had Slmkespear erefore allied himself with the Turks. The As Saud were prepared to hold ^o. C.'lO^'' what they had recovered during the last 15 years of their ancient dominion in 15.5.13. rabia, and felt capable of being able to do so comparatively easily but for the 3076 t -32 P.R. to Gr. of I, 866, 18.5.13, P. 1921/13. P. 2025/13. P. 2182/13. menace of Turkish aggression only possible from the East by way of Hasa and from the West by Mecca and Medina. To withstand the Turks from both directions they felt was beyond their strength, and to render secure their eastern borders, thus making their full force available for the defence of their western boundaries, was one of the reasons for their desire to evict the Turks from Hasa and Katif. Another most important one was that possession of these rich districts, with their ports, and especially Ojair, would furnish a valuable source , of revenue. Moreover, the As Sand had other grounds, and just ones, for their claim to Hasa and Katif. One was that these districts formerly belonged to their house; another was that the Turks themselves, in a document given to Abdulla bin Faisal by Nafiz Pasha, the General who commanded Midhat Pasha's expedition to Katif in 1871, had agreed that the area should belong to and be governed by Abdulla and his family. The Amir informed me that this document had only recently come into his possession, and on his return to Riyadh he would send me a copy. Another document of which he had heard, but so far had not succeeded in tracing, was one which purported to be an agreement made by Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly guaranteeing on behalf of the British Government that the As Sand family would be recognised as the Sheikhs of the Katif District. This document, he said, was the result of negotiations after the naval action at Katif and Dammam (in 1865), when four men named Muhammad bin Ma'ana, Abdul Aziz bin Umr, Saleh A1 Widawi and Ibrahim bin Ghanim were sent by Faisal As Sand as his representatives to the Resident. I have no archives with which to test the accuracy of the Amir's assertions, but I find a declaration printed on page 156 of Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. XII, as No. XXVIII, which seems to bear on this transaction.'' 157. Captain Shakespear in his report stated that while for want of early records he was unaware of the earlier relations of H.M. Government with the As Saud family, ' I am aware, however, that we had frequently to take punitive measures against the Wahabis for interference with the Trucial Chiefs and Bahrein, but in this connection now I am convinced that ' Bin Saud ' would be only too glad to furnish us with any undertaking we desired for the maintenance of the ' Status quo ' in the future.' 158. Sir Percy Cox, in forwarding this report, remarked: 'As regards Captain Shakespear's references to past history and to certain putative agreements between the British Government and the Wahabi Amir, I think one of the letters to which he refers is probably that addressed by Colonel Pelly to the Amir on 6th January, 1866, in which he alluded to ' Your Highness's Governor of Katif,'* . . . My own records have not ,so far produced anything of utility.' Capture of Hasa by Ihn Saud: May 1913. 159. On 13th May 1913 the Political Resident reported that Ibn Saud had captured Hasa without opposition. On 31st May the Viceroy reported that Sir P. Cox had pointed out that the draft Anglo-Turkish Convention, which had been under consideration since 1911 with a view to regulating relations between Turkey and H.M. Government in the Gulf Area, and which inter alia dealt with Nejd as a Turkish Sanjak, and the expulsion of the Turks from Nejd and Hasa, were somewhat irreconcilable phenomena, and had suggested the possibility of getting the T urks to look the facts in the face and '' with our help to arrange to include in the Convention a satisfactory solution of the problem, the basis being that Ibn Saud should be recognised as autonomous ruler of Nejd under the suzerainty of the Porte, and that we should be accorded the right to accredit an agent to him as one of the maritime rulers and make agreements with him, with the knowledge of the Porte, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic, slave trade and piracy, and our mission in the Gulf generally.' 160 The Government of India thought it impossible at this late hour to raise the question of the status of Nejd without running the risk of wrecking the negotiations with Turkey—a view accepted by the Foreign Office; and Sir Edward Grey indicated that he thought it ' preferable to await developments, * This letter embodied an ultimatum to the Wahabi Amir in regard to the Sur incident of 1865, and stated: This letter will be handed to Your Hiediness's Governor of Katif ' IE strictly 1 itude B ofEa OilStU 11 ^};Agent jlsijtifflating Ourtun I, OnllUi Kjigt of Has? italislett* aim the sa ffita aid t !i confident m wMcli i wkjs conq' Ilk and El feme terms tore that tlio tttos)' I Sir Percy sfealitnecess II OslltliJ fStionl ^ioned h 5 ^Jllly33 I., No. 2048, 4.7.13, P. 3344/13. and to adhere as long as possible to the present policy of ELM. Government, which is to abstain strictly from intervention, direct or indirect, in the affairs of Nejd. The general attitude of H.M. Government, which in this matter is based on considerations of European policy, is to consolidate the power of the Central Government in Asiatic Turkey, and if H.M. Government were to approach the Ottoman Government, as suggested by Sir P. Cox, with a view to concluding direct agreements with Ibn Saud as an autonomous ruler, it would give rise to suspicion and might have far-reaching and regrettable effects.' Ihn Saud and the Trucial Area 1913. 161. On 18th June the Viceroy reported that Ibn Saud had sent an envoy to p. 2449 /13. the Residency Agent at Shargah, bearing a letter to him and one for the Sheikh of Dabai, intimating that he had recovered without bloodshed '' the ancestral possessions of his forefathers, namely, Hasa and its dependencies, and had established peace and public security therein.'' Overtures by Ihn Saud to H.M. Government, June 1913. 162. On 13th June 1913 Ibn Saud wrote to Sir P. Cox informing him of the conquest of Hasa, and suggesting a friendly understanding. The following p . e . toG.of extract from his letter is of importance because of its reference both to an earlier T ^ British treaty with Wahabis and to the ' dependencies ' of Hasa, &amp;c. :— 'We beg to address Your Honour in consideration of the previous friendship between us and you and of the still earlier treaty belonging to the time of my grandfather, Faisal—may God forgive him—of the period of which 55 years have elapsed and 55 years still remain to run. I desire to establish the same in the same manner as it existed between you and my ancestors, and this (fact) has prompted me to make this reference. Firstly, I am confident that there will happen nothing to your people to produce causes which may be contrary to friendship and rules. And we have nowadays conquered the countries of our fathers and forefathers (viz.), El Hasa and El Katif, as well as their dependencies. ... I desire to be on the same terms with you as existed between you and my ancestors, and I p desire that those terms should exist between me and you after them (my il:. ancestors).' Pi. | 163. Sir Percy Cox replied (9th July 1913) that the British Government p.r. toG .ot 0 considered it necessary to observe a strictly neutral attitude towards both sides. ^ 2249, No reference was made to the alleged treaties with the Amir Faisal. P '3441/13 Ihn Saud's Overtures to the Turks, July 1913. ml 154. On 11th July 1913 Sir P. Cox reported that an envoy from Ibn Saud A had reached Bahrein en route for Basra with telegrams to Constantinople p. 2763/13.

Ibn Saud and Qatar; Apprehensions of the Trucial Sheikhs, July 1913. 166. On 1st August the Government of India reported the death on 17th July of the Sheikh of Qatar, and stated that the Political Agent, Bahrein, had informed the Resident that while at Katif Ibn Saud had addressed the Sheikh of Qatar and demanded the expulsion of the Turkish garrison from A1 Bidaa. ' Residency Agent, Trucial Coast, reports that Sheikhs of Debai and Abu Dhabi, who are of the same tribe, have had a conference, and latter, who since the Wahabi evacuation has achieved a paramount position in Baraimi and neighbourhood, is convinced that Ibn Saud will now turn his activities in that direction. In this fear the two Sheikhs have decided to mobilise their Bedouins in the Sabakhat el Matti (vide page 1200, Persian Gulf Gazetteer) and take the initiative against Ibn Saud. There having been nothing unfriendly in our reply to Ibn Saud, I [Sir P. Cox] should not imagine that he would think it worth while to hostilize us by such action, but of course the state of Oman generally at present offers him a very favourable oppor tunity, if he be so disposed. I am warning Sheikhs of the improbability of such a development, and deterring them from provoking hostilities, but I should be glad to give them, if possible, something reassuring as to the attitude of the British Government towards a possible enterprise of this kind on the part of Ibn Saud.' British Guarantees to Qatar, 1913. 167. The Resident was instructed in reply that the new Sheikh of Qatar ' and, if necessary, Ibn Saud, should be informed that H.M. Government would r allow no outside interference in the peninsula. Latter should clearly understand that if he attempts it, he will be forcibly resisted. Former may be told that he ^ has nothing to fear from Turks.' H.M. Government and Ihn Saud as a Potential Danger in the Trucial Area, 1913. 168. On 7th August the Political Resident telegraphed to the Government inter alia that— ' At any rate for a long time to come the Porte can exercise no control whatever over Ibn Saud and that meanwhile he is in a position to give a varying deal of inconvenience alike in regard to Oman, the Trucial Coast and Katr, which inconvenience an innocuous modus vivendi, arranged if necessary with the knowledge of the Porte, would obviate. It is not a question of any desire to interfere in the politics of Central Arabia. Ibn Saud is now at the coast, and for us it is a question of a new menace to our interests in the Gulf sphere which we need either to sterilise or protect ourselves against.' Iiisalsoinfi Li of views 1 liEtment Mmenh iiieiin t Views of Government of India, August 1913. 169. \ he V iceroy on 10th August in a telegram commenting on the general situation, and urging a modification in the policy hitherto adopted by H .M. Government, said that— It is clear from his [Ibn Saud's] relations with the Sheikh of Katr and the recent reports as to the apprehensions of the Trucial Chiefs that Ibn Saud is becoming a more and more prominent factor in the politics of the Persian Gulf littoral, and has thus brought himself within the sphere of our interests and influence. As long as Ibn Saud confined himself to Al Hasa he could be ignored with impunity. Such a policy, however, cannot in our opinion safely be pursued now that there is a possibility of his inter ference in El Katr, with the Trucial Chiefs, and possibly in Oman, where the rebellion may give him an opportunity for encroachment on Muscat territory Unless we come to some mutual and amicable under-i^olk - ■- dtol|| 35 standing with the Amir, who has hitherto been friendly disposed to us, the probability is that we shall force him to adopt an attitude of permanent hostility, which cannot but react unfavourably on the Chiefs of the littoral. We therefore strongly advocate not any definite treaty with the Amir, but a friendly interchange of views in which we should intimate to him that we expect him not to interfere with the territories of Chiefs with whom we have treaty or other relations on the Gulf littoral. We see no reason why if this were done with the full knowledge of the Porte, to whom our intentions could be clearly explained, there should be any risk of offending Turkish susceptibilities or raising their suspicions. We might warn the Trucial Chiefs seriously against any provocative action against the Amir, but instead of assuring them of immunity from him, which is only likely to encourage them to assume a truculent attitude towards him, we might tell them that our relations with the Amir are such that their fears of aggression on his part are groundless.' Views of H .M. Government, August 1 ; 913. 170. H.M. Government on consideration agreed generally with the Govern- 1 .0. to P.O.. ment of India, and on the suggestion of the Secretary of State for India, Hakki 13 .8 .13. Pasha was also informally told that H.M. Government owing to the death of the f - 0 ; ^ L0 » Sheikh of Qatar and subsequent events must in order to carry out their obligations 37510/13 make Ibn Saud either their friend or their enemy; that they could not afford to s. of s. to make him their enemy; and that they therefore proposed to enter into a friendly Vic., exchange of views with him in order to regularise the position—a communication 2] -8- 1 3. which the Pasha received in a friendly spirit and promised to communicate to his Government. 171. In September 1913 Ibn Saud, in reply to the Resident's letter of 9th July (paragraph 163 above), asked for a clearer explanation of the British attitude. Sir Percy Cox intimated on 11th September 1913 that it was somewhat difficult to give the explanations desired without fuller information as to Ibn Saud's wishes. He suggested a meeting, and added : — 'Meanwhile, I have my Government's authority to assure you that, pro vided you undertake on your part to abstain from all action calculated to disturb the status quo, or to create unrest, among the Arab Principalities whose rulers are in relation with the British Government, including the Principality of Katr, the independence of which under the Government of the late Sheikh Jasim and his successors of the Bin Thani family has been recently recognised by the British and Turkish Governments, the British Government will continue to maintain the friendly relations which have been sustained in the past.'

On 2nd October the Foreign Office intimated that a reply had been received from Hakki Pasha to the communication referred to in paragraph 170 above, in which the Porte expressed their thanks for the friendly offer of H.M. Government stated that they were actually in negotiation with Ibn Saud, and added that if the necessity should arise for recourse to the good offices of H.M. Government the Porte would not fail to avail itself of them. 173. On 15th December the Ambassador at Constantinople reported that the Turkish Government had intimated that they proposed to recognise the recent fait accompli in Nejd by nominating Ibn Saud A1 Mutasarif of the district. Discussion between Acting Political Resident, Captain Shake spear, and Ibn Saud: l§th December 1913. 174. Endeavours were made to arrange a meeting between the Political Kesident and Ibn Saud towards the end of 1913, and on 16th December Major Trevor and Captain Shakespear met Ibn Saud and had an exhaustive discussion with him. The following points are taken from a memorandum of the interview which was read over to Ibn Saud and in the terms of which he concurred :— 'His family, he said, had been in Nejd from time immemorial and had for generations ruled over it without interference from outside. He himself 3076 K P.O. to I.O., 39902/13, P. 4062/13. Const, to P.O., 977, 1.12.13, P. 5002/13.36 was an Arab chief, whose views on matters of policy naturally differed from those of European powers. Bedouin tribes are not concerned in weighing the merits of different governments, as they live as nomads and when oppressed move off to another locality In recent years he had been able to consolidate his authority in Central Arabia and has now taken Hasa and Qatif All he wants is to be left in peace and he sees that the British Government keeps the peace all along the coasts of the Persian Gulf, except in this small section of the coast of the Hasa province. If he could get an assurance that the British Government would maintain the maritime peace on this strip of coast and recognise his position as de facto ruler he would be satisfied. If not, he would have to trust in his own sword In the discussion which followed Ibn Saud said he would be glad to co-operate with the British Government in the suppression of piracy and the illicit arms traffic and in the maintenance of the maritime truce and would also agree not to interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Trucial Coast and to admit British subjects and representatives in his territory, provided that the British Government would give him the assurances mentioned above. In fact, he went further than this and said he would be willing to consult the British Government in all matters if he received these assurances. We again repeated that it was quite impossible to give him any such assurance. In the course of his remarks Ibn Saud pointed out that though he claimed Trucial Oman and Qatar as part of his ancestral dominions and could make his power felt there, he was quite willing to meet the wishes of the British Government in regard to them. He hinted that the only reason which restrained him from overrunning Qatar and possibly Trucial Oman after he had occupied Hasa and Qatif was his desire not to alienate the sympathy of the British Government.' 175. In a separate memorandum the negotiators recorded that Ibn Saud, after the discussion on the subject of arranging a modus vivendi had been con cluded, enquired the policy of the British Government &lt;£ in regard to Qatar and the Trucial Oman States. We said that we could not make any definite pronouncement on the subject, but that as a general rule, as far as we were aware, the policy of the Government was one of non-interference in internal matters. In the case of the Trucial Sheikhs we had certain agreements of long standing regarding the maritime truce, the slave trade and arms traffic, to which we held the Sheikhs, but we did not as a rule interfere with their rule on shore. As regards Qatar we translated to him the clause referring to that region in the recent Anglo- Turkish Convention and said that we assumed the British policy there would also be one of non-interference It proved that Ibn Saud's enquiry was due to the possibility that enemies of his might take refuge in some of these States and plot against him, and he enquired what the attitude of Government would be in regard to such cases.' The negotiators were unable to state definitely, but promised to refer the matter to higher authority. ' He was apparently satisfied with this, but urged that the matter was important to him as affecting his authority over the adjacent Bedouin tribes. At any time in order to check the intrigues of such people, it might be necessary for him to take reprisals, and this might involve him with the British Government, which he was anxious to avoid.' The nego tiators recorded that Ibn Saud had also said ' in a more informal manner that he would not interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Trucial Coast States.' Views of Political Resident. 176 Mr. Lorimer, in forwarding this report, suggested the desirability, u* the event of a mutual arrangement being reached between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, of disposing of the question of his relations with the Sheikhs of Qatar and Tiucial Oman and that of the control of refugees from his authority who settled under their protection. &lt;£ These questions arise from Ibn Saud's own position as an Arab chief and do not concern the Turks. It might be arranged with Ibn baud, on condition of his not entering the territory of the said Sheikhs without our consent, that we should use our influence to prevent or restrain refugees whose conduct in their chosen places of residence is shown to be injurious to Ibn baud's legitimate interests.' in37 S8 fsisii fe [fiy wd,, 177. Endeavours were meanwhile proceeding in London to assist in the reaching of an understanding between the Turks and Ibn Saud. A memorandum drawn up by Sir Percy Cox and communicated to Hakki Pasha on 9th March 1914 remarked that our requirements of Ibn Saud for the maintenance and protection oi our interests included inter alia '' that he should not meddle in the territory or politics of Arab principalities in the Gulf, including the Trucial Coast and Qatar. ' Hakki Pasha replied that he must refer the matter to his Government, and the Resident was instructed to inform Ibn Saud that H.M. Government were endeavouring to effect an arrangement with the Turkish Government and to warn him not to act independently. The Ambassador in Constantinople on 2nd April 1914 urged the desirability of watching the situation and awaiting mrther developments, the Turkish Government having intimated that they had a strong hope of coming to a settlement themselves. T reaty of 15 th M ay 1914 between I bn S aud and T urkey. 178. On 15th May 1914 a treaty (the original of which was found during the war among Turkish records at Basra) was concluded between Ibn Saud and the Turkish Government. The text of the treaty is reproduced in Appendix A. It will be seen that it proceeds on the basis that Ibn Saud is a Turkish subject and vassal.

Government concluded a further Convention (ratified on 3rd June 1914) with Turkey, which provided that the line separating British and Turkish Spheres in South-Western Arabia should rejoin 'dans le Ruba-al-Khali, sur le parallele 20°, la ligne droite et directe vers le sud qui part d un point sur la rive meridionale du golfe d'Oudjeir et qui separe le territoire Ottoman du sandjak de Nedjd du territoire d'El Katr, en conformite de 1'article 11 de la Convention anglo-ottomane du 29 juillet 1913 relatif au Golfe Persique et aux territoires environnants.' 180. On 4th June 1914 the Foreign Office, the news of the conclusion of Ibn Sand's treaty with Turkey not yet having been made public, strongly urged f .O . to i.o. the importance of avoiding any action which might lend colour to suspicions that 4,6.14. H.M. Government were supporting Ibn Saud's policy of 'making himself independent,' and in the same connection referred to him as ' a Turkish subject and specifically recognised _ as such by the Anglo-Turkish Convention' of 29th July 1913. Sir E. Grey is, in fact, convinced that it would not be compatible with our engagements that Ibn Saud should be treated otherwise, or that independent communications with him should be held except in cases where they cannot be avoided.' S ummary , 1901 to 1914. 181. From the above it will be seen that Ibn Saud, emerging as the repre sentative of the Saudi family and capturing Riyadh from Ibn Rashid in 1901, by 1913 had consolidated his position in Nejd, and in the same year drove the Turks out of Hasa. His repeated overtures to H.M. Government between 1901 and 1913 with a view to securing their protection against the Turks had no result. In May 1914 he accepted the position of Turkish Wali of Nejd and concluded an understanding with a duly authorised Turkish representative, the basis of which was that he was an Ottoman subject and lieutenant of the Ottoman I orte in this area. TT v.—From the outbreak of the Great War to the opening of the Blue Line Discussions, 1914-1934. British Offers to Ibn Saud in return for his Co-oferation against Turkey. 182. The importance of securing the support of Ibn Saud and the Arab Hnlers of the Gulf (or, at any rate, of preventing them from giving active support P- 3683/14, to the Turks) in the event of war with Turkey was patent; and H.M.

P| j|!| ilpl , &lt; Ibn Saud's Response. M 1B3 Ibn Saud on the outbreak of war took the field against his rival, Ibn Rashid arid used his preoccupations in this quarter as an excuse for not responding to the Turkish request for active military support against the Allies. Tt Droved ^impossible to pilrsue discussions with him as to an understanding on the lines referred to in the preceding paragraph until the end of 1914, when Captain Shakespear, on the instructions of H.M. Government, met and discussed the position with him. Ibn Saud intimated that he was entirely on the British side and that he would commence verbal negotiations on the subject of the offers made him by H M. Government in the near future. In a letter to the Political Resident of 28th November 1914 he referred to the British promise of recognition of his independence as ' Her recognition of the independence of my Chief ship of att the parts of Nejd, El Hasa and Katif.' Ihn Smd's terms, January 1915. 184 In January 1915 further discussions took place between Tbn Saud and p r to G of Captain Shakespear. The Amir's attitude was that being ultimately dis- L 18115 appointed of British intervention on his behalf m April 1914 he was obliged to p. 975/15.' com e to an understanding with the Turks sufficient to secure his immunity xrom their aggression. He was now anxious for a signed treaty giving him a solid guarantee of his position under the segis of Great Britain. If the treaty was not soon concluded, force of circumstances might drive him to give some overt demon stration of his intention to side with the Turks. On the other hand^mce it was concluded he would use all his resources and influence on our side. He proposed a draft. I vl 185. The following are the portions of the draft submitted by Ibn Sana, which bear on the question of his boundaries and of his abstention from inter ference with the territories of the Arab proteges of H.M.

Captain Shakespear, in his letter forwarding this draft, remarked that the addition to our responsibility did not appear heavy. The Turkish menace from the we^t and north of Nejd, though very real to Ibn Saud, need give us n anxiety; and while we should probably be called upon to act as arbiters som ® w fr more fr6q\16ritly than hitherto between Arab Sheikhs along the coast and 1 Saud, this was a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. 187. Sir Percy Cox saw no special difficulty as regards the clauses referr to in paragraph 185 above, but remarked, as regards protection against exteiM aggression by land, that, ' apart from the Turks, Central Arabia is practica y inaccessible by land to any power but ours, and I venture to think that we snou incur little risk by giving the desired undertaking, subject to the reservati that aggression be unprovoked.'

Discussions were pursued on this basis between Sir Percy Cox and P.R. to GK of ertotlf Ibn Saud in April 1915. The British draft and the draft submitted by Ibn Saud I &gt; 1318 B., useofw on the points now under consideration were then as follows :— ' 26.6.15, 'Wfej British Draft. Ihn Saud's Draft. Article I.

H.M. Government gave Sir Percy Cox a discretion as regards the p. 2966/15. alternatives suggested by Ibn Saud. A greement between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud, 10th June 1915. 191. On the 10th June 1915 Ibn Saud reached an agreement with Saud bin P. 772/16. Abdul Aziz Ibn Rashid. Its terms are of some interest as showing the extent at the time of Ibn Saud's tribal claims. The agreement provided &lt;c that Nejd and all the interior from A1 Kahaf to the valley of Duwasir and all territories of Ibn Saud and the encampments of Matair, Ataiba, Harb, Bani Abdulla, Ajman, A1 Morra, A1 Manasir, Bani Hajer, Sabia, A1 Sahul, Qahtauf, and A1 - Duwasir, and everybody included among them, are subjects of Ibn Saud. I, Ibn Rashid, have nothing to do with them. . . . ' aj# Treaty of 26th December 1915 between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud. 192. After further discussions between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud, a treaty p. 668/16. -LOLj. XXX LCL iUiUUCi UCUVVCCii kJii -L ^ J OLXXVA ou JT. UUO/XU. was finally signed on 26th December 1915. The Saudi draft of Article I, as set p.r . to GLof 5 t: out in paragraph 189 above, was accepted. It appeared that the reason for the L, No. 35 c., Saudi version was that Jubail was the locality where Ibn Saud's limits on the 3.1.16. coast approached those claimed by Koweit, and that for that reason he wished to ^ itc ^ XI1 ' have it specified. As it was well outside the boundary accepted by H.M. Govern- p ''206-8. 0 ment for Koweit in their negotiations with the Turks, Sir Percy Cox saw no 3iis$ objection to its acceptance. 3076 L40 193. In the case of Article VI, the Saudi draft, with a very slight verbal modification, was accepted. In its final form it ran as follows :— ' Ibn Saud undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrain, and of the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast, who are under the protection of the British Government and who have treaty relations with the said Government, and the limits of their territories shall be hereafter determined.' The words ' other chiefs and tribes ' proposed in the original British draft quoted in paragraph 189 above were omitted in deference to Ibn Saud's state ment that the several chiefs whom we did protect and had relations with were all mentioned, so that the words in question seemed unnecessary. 194. In Article VII, the British draft of which provided that a further detailed treaty should be concluded '' in regard to other matters jointly concerning' the British Government and Ibn Saud, Ibn Saud successfully pressed for the omission of the word ' other.' He pointed out that some of the matters such as boundaries were among those already alluded to in the present treaty, so that there seemed no need to say '' other.'' 195. From the above it will be seen that it was H.M. Government who them selves suggested the inclusion in the treaty of a provision for the subsequent determination and definition of the boundaries of the Persian Gulf States, our special relations with which Ibn Saud undertook to respect. Construction of Articles I and II of Treaty of 1915. 196. During 1916 Sharif Husain of Mecca wrote to Ibn Saud asking for an alliance and assistance. This overture was reported to Sir Percy Cox by the Amir of Nejd, who expressed mistrust of the Sharif's intentions. As a result, Sir Percy Cox recommended on 8th September 1916 that Ibh Saud should be ' informed definitely that no present or future understanding between us and the Sharif would prejudice our adherence to the terms of Articles I and II of our treaty with him of 26th December 1915.' He was instructed in reply that 'as the policy of encouraging an Arab State or confederation of States was not dead, anything repudiating it should be avoided,' and that ' reference to the treaty should be confined to Article I, as we could not admit that Article II was binding on us against other Arabs.' A verbal assurance on the lines indicated appears to have been given to Ibn Saud by Sir Percy Cox at Koweit on 21st November 1916. 197. The Foreign Office in a memorandum drawn up about this time remarked tnat the wording of Article I of the treaty in effect 'commits us to arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between Ibn Saud and King Husain, and in the last resort to impose an effective sanction for our award.' A greement of 1922 with I bn S aud on K oweit B oundaries. 198. In 1922 an agreement was reached with Ibn Saud, who in that year | overthrew the Rashid, in regard to the boundaries of Koweit. The agreement ,) referred in terms to the boundaries accepted by H.M. Government for that principality in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, but, by agree- ment between the two parties, and, with the subsequent concurrence of the Sheikh , of Koweit, it varied those boundaries in favour of the Saudi ruler. S ummary , 1914 to 1922. 199. During this period Ibn Saud in 1915 concluded a treaty with H.M. Government, in which the latter recognised him as the independent ruler of Nejd, and he undertook not to interfere with the territories of their Arab proteges. By 1922 he had finally defeated and captured the representative oi the Ibn Rashidi family. In the same year he entered into agreements under which he received certain concessions in the Koweiti hinterland, and by which the boundaries of Koweit, Nejd and Iraq were delimited. ' lirl41 iry, 1922-1934. Representations by the Sheikh of Qatar, 1921-22. Ihn Saud warned to respect Qatar, 1922. 200. In 1921 the Sheikh of Qatar represented that he was alarmed lest iginaljj some of his townspeople should become Akhwan and join Ibn Saud, and enquired njy whether H.M. Government would assist him should he be attacked from the interior. He was informed that H.M. Government were not prepared to promise p g 13 more than diplomatic assistance should Ibn Saud attack him. Late in 1922 he ' ' intimated that, while he did not fear an open attack by Ibn Saud so long as the latter remained on good terms with H.M. Government, he was seriously concerned by the more subtle methods employed, he alleged, by the Nejd authorities to undermine his position. The Resident suggested that a hint might be given to ittiatf ^ au( ^ k ee P his people in order, but no action was taken on this d to ii| proposal. In November-December 1922 Sir Percy Cox, finding that Ibn Saud proposed to include the whole of the peninsula of Qatar in a concession for oil in the Hasa district which was then under consideration, intimated to him that this erntiti could not be accepted and that he had nothing to do with Qatar except to respect fortlfi ^ under the terms of his Treaty with us, and insisted on the limitation of his nGalt't discussions to country west of the longitude of Salwa Bay. Sir P. Cox is stated by Lt.-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, who was present, to have drawn on a map a line running from Djau-ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must represent the Eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect [915 of Hasa. The Sultan accepted this injunction without argument. The line in h.c., question, it may be remarked, cuts across the Blue Line, which was never men- Bagdad, to i M tioned in the discussions. Sir Percy Cox has since stated that, to the best of his G - of L ' P® recollection, nothing took place in his discussion with Ibn Saud which would J q 1 Pol ods. i ; prevent His Majesty's Government from claiming the Blue Line as the eastern tw Memo ■boundary of Saudi Arabia. B. 430/P z.' 614/34. Reassertion of Wahahi influence in Trucial Oman and at Baraimi, 1922-34. 201. In 1922, when Sheikh Sultan bin Zaid murdered and succeeded his brother, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, he found that the authority of his family in Baraimi, where it had been predominant since 1870, had fallen to a low ebb; and Pol. Res. the Beni Naim of Baraimi were engaged in conflicts with Abu Dhabi. In June to c o -' 1925 it was reported that the Awamir and the Dam had appealed to the Wahabi Amir of Hasa to protect them from Abu Dhabi, and in the same month it was reported that the Amir had sent an official to collect zakat in the Baraimi oasis, who was generally, but not invariably successful. This official also arrested and hanged a Hasawi refugee in Baraimi and notified the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Debai that the Amir of Hasa had taken the Awamir and Daru tribes, who were fundamentally Muscat subjects, under the protection of the Sultan of Nejd. i 9.6.26. ard' 7^ Anti-Wahabi combinations in Oman, 1925. ^ 202. In July 1925 it appeared that the Sheikhs of the Beni Naim, Beni Khatib and the Beni Kaab had been negotiating with Shargah for mutual assist- f ance in the event of aggression by the Wahabis, and in August 1925, after a 4 ,l ■ conference between Debai and the Imam of the fanatical Ibadhi tribes of the ^ hinterland of Muscat, it was agreed that the two should support one another lfI against the W^abis. Further Wahahi activity, 1925-26. a it 203. In December 1925 a letter received by the Sheikh of Debai from the Amir of Hasa contained a serious threat against the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. In February , 0 { t S 1^26 the Amir of Hasa appears to have sent police to Shargah in pursuit of a Nej di '^r: criminal. He was not found there and the police proceeded to Ajman and n t'# ^ as Khaimah. The man escaped detection. It was reported at the same time I JyjC that Nejdi slavetraders were bringing negroes and war captives to the coastal towns for sale, and that the Trucial Sheikhs were afraid to interfere with them.\ .'O Pol.

Reports, 1928-33. 42 In March 1926 the Amir of Hasa sent two officials to collect zakat in Dhafra and Baraimi, and in two judicial cases about this time he is stated to have written first to the Kazi of Shargah and secondly to the Sheikh of Debai 'chiding them for not satisfying Nejdi complainants. The Kazi sent his son to Hofuf to express regret.' Views of Political Resident, 1926. 204. The Political Resident expressed the view in 1926 that the region of Dhafra, some 14,000 miles square, which stretches 175 miles from west to east and 80 from north to south, bounded on the north by the Persian Gulf and on the south by the Rub al Khali, belonged, with three smaller coastal tracts to its west, historically and de jure to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The first business of the Wahabis, if they were to establish themselves in Eastern Arabia, must be to absorb this region. East of it they would have little difficulty in procuring the adherence of the people of Baraimi, Haffit and Dhahirah, on account of the antipathy of some for Abu Dhabi and of others for the Ibadhi fanatics of the Muscat hinterland. He added that the kazis in all the chiefships except Abu Dhabi and Debai were actually Nejdis. 205. The Resident stated that the tribal situation was that Abu Dhabi and Debai were wholeheartedly opposed to Ibn Saud, and were followed by the Beni Yas and Manasir of Dhafra, Mijan, Akal, and the Dhawahir of Baraimi. Umm al Qaiwain, the Beni Khatib tribe and the Beni Kaab were inclined to be neutral. Shargah and Ras al Khaimah had a century earlier been bigoted Wahabis. ^rferers fc T jl Tte sll P ■ 'V fo referred i In that; at itoaimattl it? of' sitional statu treaty, Trucial Oman and the Wahabis, April 1927. 206. A further report by Sir Lionel Ha worth in the spring of 1927 confirmed ill Heinsti that Debai and Abu Dhabi were opposed to Wahabism and had no desire to come j^ronsionso under the sway of Ibn Saud, and stated that Ras al Khaimah and Shargah were jbtlie ques closely sympathetic to the Wahabis, and that with them there might be bracketed iikmnieiit f n O lOCJCJOT 1 r&gt;ni£k-rc« /^V-r A nTV -»0 -f-» O /-I T T TV-* fV^ &lt;-* 1 c\ ^^ nr\ i ( nni.~ 1 ^ -i- ~ WiJ ftkAwlJ the lesser chiefs of Ajman and Ummal Qaiwain. ' The latter four chiefs were actually Wahabis some hundred years ago, and are already in private [iGulf Coa communication with the Wahabi leaders.' Position at Baraimi 1927-34. 207. I he oasis of Baraimi was, the Resident reported, occupied by three different sections of Arabs, the Nairn, in close touch with Muscat and with no desire to be absorbed by the Wahabis; the villages belonging to the Sheikh of Abu Dha.bi, partly occupied by the Dhawahir, and equally anti-Wahabi; and the El Shamis, a branch of the Naimi, in close touch with the chiefs of Ras al Khaimah and Shargah and strongly Wahabi in tone. ' The Baraimi section of this tribe have recently paid willing tribute to the Wahabi agent of the Governor of Hasa, who came to Baraimi, and they would encourage the extension of Wahabi power.' Of these sections, the first were the strongest and their chief occupied the fort at Baraimi. It will be seen that the pro-Wahabi element was in a minority and did not in 1927 occupy the fort, and this is of importance in estimating the weight to be attached to the payment of zakat to the Wahabis by Baraimi. 208. Later in the same year, however, the Baraimi Sheikhs, apparently acting under the influence of Ibn Saud's agent, and possibly apprehensive that Presence of the Wazir of Muscat, Mr. Bertram Thomas, portended aggressions by the Sultan, or that the establishment of a landing ground was likely to be a threat to their independence, refused to allow an R.A.F. party to reconnoitre t e oasis. For convenience it may be recorded at this stage that despite this incident however, no interference with the affairs of the Trucial Sheikhs by Ibn ^aud s agent for Baraimi was reported in 1928-1931. In 1932, a cousin of tne pneikn of Baraimi having been ambushed by Bedouin consisting of Abu Dhabi subjects and Manasir tribesmen, hostilities' broke out between Abu Dhabi, liaraimi and Dibai. Peace was restored after three months' fighting. It may noted that there appears to have been no interference in this dispute by any lepiesen ative of Ibn Saud and that the parties fought it out among themselves without any outside interference. There is no record since that date of Saudi ttbinsel outside 'precise nal tfeant cii bee by ti I D a 'wernmeni wtieoblii ^ infer ti ^ 01 under Nswe, :.] 0 Wl t( jSfes t Sit a , ?... „43 Bushire Desp., 671 S., 15.7.34, P.Z. 4860/ 3 4. ;Ak| iwedkl M iW interference; and in July 1934 that Ibn Saud had no agent at Baraimi, although his zakat gatherers sometimes went as far East as this point, ' c where, however, sn l ( they do not press for fixed rates, but take what is given to them.' The Resident stated that the Awamir and Manasir had for the last four or five years paid zakat to Ibn Saud (having at an earlier stage paid it to Abu Dhabi). No zakat was paid him by the Trucial Sheikhs. tkllt: 209. The supplementary treaty envisaged by Article VII of the Treaty of 26th December 1915 (para. 194 above) was never, in fact, concluded, nor Vas any supplementary agreement entered into with Ibn Saud on the matters then under discussion, with the exception of the agreement regarding the boundaries of Koweit referred to in paragraph 198. The treaty of 1915 held the field until 1927. T he T reaty of J edda , 1927. 210. In that year, after lengthy negotiations, a fresh treaty was concluded Aitch. Xii, with Ibn Saud at Jedda on 20th May. H.M. Government, concerned by the ^ 0 - vii ' activities of the Amir of Hasa, to which reference is made in paras. 201-207, vv ' 227 ~ 33 - decided to aim at the embodiment in any new treaty of the provisions of Article VI of the Treaty of 1915, binding Ibn Saud to respect the position of the Arab Sheikhdoms in alliance with H .M. Government, despite the fact that Ibn Saud had since the date of that treaty grown greatly both in strength and in international stature. They accordingly included that Article as Article VI in a new draft treaty, acceptance of which by Ibn Saud their negotiators were to endeavour to secure. 211. The instructions to the negotiators remarked that the draft reproduced F.O. Desp. 'the provisions of Article VI of the treaty of 1916 save that no reference is made to the question of determining the limits of the territory mentioned, p 4003/26 ' H.M. Government have given careful consideration to the question whether Ibn Saud should be invited to refrain from aggression on the Rulers of the Persian Gulf Coast. It appeared to them doubtful whether in practice such an engagement would effectively deter Ibn Saud if he were determined to absorb some petty neighbouring Arab State. Moreover, H.M. Government did not wish to commit themselves to recognise the extent of Ibn Saud's domains or to protect territories outside those domains, but would have preferred to remain free to take what action they considered necessary in each particular case, having regard to the precise nature of their relations with the principality concerned and to other relevant circumstances.' In view, however, of the recent instances of interference by the Amir of Hasa, referred to in paragraphs 201-207 above, H.M. Government ' came to the conclusion that if Ibn Saud were not asked to reassume the obligation imposed upon him by Article VI of the treaty of 1916, he might infer that they would not oppose any interference by him with the integrity of the Rulers in question and would thus be encouraged to extend his influence in South-East Arabia. ... If, however, Ibn Saud should finally prove unwilling to agree to reassume the obligation in the new treaty, you should inform him that H.M. Government hold themselves free to take what action they consider necessary in particular cases.' % 212. Ibn Saud raised no objection to the draft Article, subject to the Sir G - substitution of the words ' maintain friendly relations with ' for the words '27 to refrain from all aggression or interference with,' and the omission of the p' 3269/27.' words ' or under the protection of the Government of His Britannic Majesty.' Jedda to His grounds were that the earlier wording was not compatible with his dignity F a s an independent Ruler, and more particularly that the term ' interference ' ^4&lt;^27 seemed to him to be capable of too wide an interpretation. The terms of the Article as finally agreed were as follows :— u His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Koweit and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government.' ipiei oftfc m Ar:-' )# 3076 M44 Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-1914 not communicated to Ibn Saud in 1927 ir.® 1 213. It may be recorded in this connection, as a point of some importance that Ibn Sand, in connection with the discussions which culminated in the Treaty ' ' ^ of Jedda, asked for a statement of the treaty engagements of H.M. Government with the rulers whose special treaty relations with them he undertook under Article VI of that treaty to respect. The list of engagements with which he was ^ His furnished did not contain the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-14. mi Inli ^Lr' 184( Ihn Saud informed that H.M. Government continue to regard the Blue Liu m sm the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as binding on him, 1934. 214. It is unnecessary to examine in any detail the events between the Treaty of Jedda and 1934. Towards the end of 1933 the question of the continental 'inalliai boundaries of Saudi Arabia was raised in an active form by the application of familv.wk the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to be allowed to negotiate for an oil concession «sion, wi in Qatar on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and by uncertainties as to [«tore-es the Eastern boundary which had been set by Ibn Saud to the oil concession he r-tedtoRj had granted in respect of Hasa. In connection with this, the Sheikh of Qatar ^ go ran and the United States Government were officially informed in the spring of 1934 that H.M. Government regarded the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention (para. 165 (c) ^ oin 1 above) as the eastern boundary of Nejd, and as a matter of courtesy the Saudi m ^ Government were informed that, enquiry as to the boundary position having been of the made by the United States Embassy at Angora, a communication in this sense wpalpo 1 liad been made to them. Ibn Saud subsequently intimated that he did not accept PuTurk the Blue Line as binding upon him, and that he preferred ancestral claims to the ^ § ai territory to the east of it. It is now accepted that the question of his eastern ri 0 f [ ( continental boundary is one on which further discussion will be necessary in the near future between him and H.M. Government. VI. '-Conclusion. 215. The history of the relations of the Wahabi Amirs with Trucial Oman, ppointed Muscat and with the British Government is given in detail above. It may be convenient, in conclusion, briefly to summarise the position and to touch upon certain of the more important general questions bearing on the difficulties which ] have arisen in connection with the Blue Line and the claims made in that connection by Ibn Saud. I.—General Historical Survey. Iv^ fis in fri] Viceroy 216. It will be seen that the Wahabi sect originated in Nejd in the early tedrelati, part of the eighteenth century; that by the end of the eighteenth century it had conquered Nejd and Hasa; and that between 1800 and 1818 it established a l^ou, commanding influence in the hinterland of Trucial Oman, the headquarters of its agent being in forts built by the Wahabis at the oasis of Baraimi—a strategical point of the first importance on the borders of Trucial Oman and the Muscat Sultanate. The Wahabi influence came to an end, and Baraimi was lost, with the defeat of the Wahabis of Nejd and Hasa by the Egyptians and the capture and execution of the Wahabi Amir in 1818. 1 lB! 5iIa ' rs o * WJfiileiit, j 217. On the revival of Wahabi power in 1824 overtures were again made by the Wahabis to the Trucial authorities. By 1831 those overtures had produced ^ a considerable effect. By 1833 Baraimi had been reoccupied, and Wahabi 1 ;relation influence appears to have been as powerful in Trucial Oman and its hinterland as it had been in the period prior to the defeat of the Wahabis by the Egyptian 5 ' lufom i he Wahabi agent at Baraimi appears to have been maintained there until be was driven out by the local tribes about 1838. Between 1837 and 1839, the Egyptians again overcame and destroyed the Wahabi power. They made endeavours, with the assistance of a former Wahabi agent at Baraimi to secure the allegiance of the Trucial Sheikhs. These, and the Beni Nairn chiefs oi Raraimi who now held the oasis, which they had recaptured from the Wahabis ; .'-hp an 1837-38, were encouraged to resist by H.M. Government, and the efforts of thelj -(li^ Egyptians ended in failure. ' ® s45 'H 218 On the withdrawal of the Egyptians in 1840, and a fresh revival of Wahabi power, endeavours were again made in 1842-3 by the Wahabi Amirs to Ni- re-establish themselves m Truoial Oman. Baraimi was surrendered by the Naim m and between that year and 1853 Wahabi influence was to a large extent ^ hjj ^ 10'0Stci0 ■ti . | ly - • Bet ^ 8n 18 fl 53 and 186 V he Wahabis continued to maintain an Agent i-1! at Baraimi. His influence was, however, much less than before, and there are fewer signs of Wahabi influence m the affairs of the Trucial Sheikhdoms or their i t h: i f ' inln i ^ ahabi Amir who appears to have paid a tribute to hi T Ce 5 laimed t0 ^n a Turklsh sub j ect (paragraph 105 above) and '1 m 1866 he appealed unsuccessfully to Turkey for help against Her Maiesty's towt Government (paragraph 92 above). In 1869 the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi was of It ^urdered at Shargah, and in the same year the Sultan of Muscat captured iea:ij ^ raim L 1 ' ^ a ^ ia pce with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, the Wahabi ranis ^ g which had since 1865 been internally divided by disputes regarding iflctliir secession, were expelled from Hasa by the Turks. They were unable to )im ? ps ? re -® stabllsl1 themselves m Trucial Oman, and by 1879 their influence J Ski S? s reduced t0 R l y a dh. Baraimi came under the influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and so remained for the next 50 years. itajE 220. From 1875 to 1901 the Saudi family are of merely local political siiitfsri importance. Cut off from the coast and confined to the centre of Arabia their ;iti;; influence is of the smallest and does not extend to Trucial Oman or its hinterland tioDilThe principal power in Nejd at this period is the Amir Ibn Rashid of the Jebei heii bhammar, a Turkish vassal. „lJL 2 ^- The Saudis, under the present Saudi King, in 1901 attacked Ibn Rashid. , or y 0 Central Arabia for the next 15 years is that of the struggles for supi emacy between the Rashidi and Saudi families, culminating in the victory of the latter in 1922. Between 1901 and 1914 repeated overtures were made by Ibn Sand to H.M. Government with a view to securing their protection against the Turks. These were invariably declined. In May 1914 he reached an under standing with Turkey under which, as a Turkish subject and a Turkish vassal, lira e was a PPointed Wali and Commandant of Nejd. n i 222. On the outbreak of the war Ibn Saud was approached both by the Turks I ta and by H.M. Government. He alleged his preoccupations with Ibn Rashid as ::: an excuse for not co-operating actively with the Turks but did not repudiate his allegiance to them. In 1915 he concluded a treaty with H.M. Government under which he undertook to respect their special relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar, and the Trucial Coast, whose boundaries should thereafter be delimited, and thereafter he co-operated with them. The treaty of 1915 regulated relations between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud until 1927. ceii® |? 223. Throughout this time there were no signs of any importance of Wahabi ;#• advances in Trucial Oman or its hinterland. In 1925-26 emissaries from the Wahabi Viceroy of Hasa were reported to have been moving in the hinterland, to have approached the Trucial Sheikhs, to have reached Baraimi and to have jdtt collected zakat from the tribes (paragraphs 201 to 207 above). The matter was \ not regarded as of great moment and no special steps were taken to deal with j Klie.' it, the affairs of the hinterland being at that stage of no concern to H.M Government. But when the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 replaced the Treaty of / *915, steps were taken to include in it a provision that Ibn Saud would respect / ut ! ^ err itories of the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast which were in special' Vf treaty relations with H.M. Government. m'WM Isiii: 124. Information accumulating since 1927 goes to suggest that Ibn Saud, as lei- re sult of the general prestige which he has achieved, and his authority with iieF J . e bedouin of Central Arabia, is becoming increasingly a power in the Trucial jjll hinterland and even as far east as Baraimi. H.M. Government have fif a oopted the attitude, both in the Persian Gulf and in dealing with the King, that | the eastern boundary of Nejd is the eastern boundary represented by the Blue ^ l^ine of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, and that they cannot acknowledge an y Saudi authority to the east of that line. This contention is vigorously con- M| ^ed by Ibn Saud, partly on the basis of what he describes as '' his ancestral claims.'W 1 ?'; i II,—P oints of S pecial I nterest. 225, The following are certain of the main points of interest in this connection (A) Policy of H.M.

Jg) tie Am Government on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf was consistently to avoid any interference in the affairs of the hinterland. In the early part of this period they were solely concerned to make the seas safe for commerce; to put down piracy; and at a slightly later stage to suppress the slave trade. As time went on I jjimtooki and ttie strategic importance of the Gulf area, particularly from the Indian stand point, became greater, they consolidated their relations with the rulers of Bahrein. Koweit, Qatar, and Muscat, and with the Trucial Sheikhs. I In 1865 fai, Itw tered into ^27. Their relations with the Wahabi Amirs in the period 1800 to 1870 were | ^ this (p, on all fours with their relations with the other rulers of this area. Once the Wahabi Amirs established themselves on the sea coast they became a matter of concern to H.M. Government, who were, however, content to abstain from all interference with their activities in the hinterland save to the extent that these might react on the position of the other maritime rulers of the Trucial area and so lead to piratical outbreaks, the revival of slavery, or the absorption of Muscat or Bahrein. They had no treaty relations with the Wahabi Amirs, and their com munications with them (apart from formal representations or demands for reparation for injuries committed at their instigation or by their subjects or| vassals) were confined to polite exchanges of letters. The one formal engagement given in the period 1800 to 1870 is a unilateral undertaking given on behalf of the Wahabi Amir in 1866 (paragraph 118 above). n llo), i alleged wimerece (M Waration tation, 228. From 1870 to 1901 H .M. Government pursued their policy of con solidating their position on the littoral. In the period 1901 to i913 they repeatedly refused to involve themselves in liabilities towards Ibn Saud. In 1913 they reached an agreement with Turkey in which the eastern boundaries of Turkish influence in Arabia were delimited. Their endeavours at the outbreak of the Great War to secure the co-operation of Ibn Saud against the Turks were successful, and in 1915 they concluded a treaty with him as an independent ruler, under which he undertook to respect the territories of their Arab allies. I It will st, there is %theWa] ^abia cs ^enunei ^29. Supplementary agreements were concluded with Ibn Saud after the war to regulate the boundaries of Koweit and Iraq, and the treaty of 1915 was replaced in 1927 by one less favourable to H.M. Government. Since 1925 the growing power of Ibn Saud and the reassertion of Persian influence by sea, the development of air communications, the transfer of the air route to India and j ^ the Kast to the Arab littoral of the Gulf, the discovery of oil on that littoral, and the fact that international oil agreements make it difficult to exclude foreign exploitation, have combined to make it necessary to take a more active interest in the affairs of the I racial Coast, and more difficult to ignore the position in its hinterland; in the case of Qatar it has been necessary in the interests of securing that any oil concession granted shall be under British influence to offer the Sheikh guarantees of protection by land; and the importance of setting a limit to Wahabi expansion in the hinterland has been held to justify the positive challenge to the position of Ibn Saud represented by the intimation to him that the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention is his Eastern boundary. N hj If line,! Sdis 1 o. hoj • h,m, { M i47 V (B) Engagements of H.M. Government with the WahaUs between 1800 and 1930. 230. The Treaty of 1915 was the first formal engagement concluded by H.M. Government with the Wahabis. In 1810 friendly letters were exchanged between the Wahabi Amir and the Government of Bombay (paragraph 26 above). In 1813, similar letters were exchanged, and again in 1814 (paragraphs 28-30). In 1820 (paragraph 32) reference was made to the existence of an earlier Anglo- Wahabi Treaty. In 1831 the Wahabis (paragraph 53) expressed a desire for the renewal of £ £ the treaty .... which was made between you, the British and Imam Sand.' No such treaty could be traced, but a friendly letter was sent in reply to the Wahabis (paragraph 54). In 1843 the Wahabi Amir (paragraph 98) expressed a desire for the renewal of the amicable relations which had existed between his father and the British Government, and a suitable reply was sent. In 1855 (paragraph 105) on the Amir being warned that the British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent powers, the Amir referred to an understanding 'between us and the British Government of 100 years' duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas.' No reference was made in reply to the contention that such an understanding existed. In 1850 the Amir (paragraph 106), endeavouring to justify himself for his attacks on the Sheikh of Bahrein, alleged that 'between the Wahabi Amir and the British Government treaties have been made by the several authorities, authority after authority,' and referred to his treaties with the Turks. The reply sent to him took no notice of this point. 231. In 1865 Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident, visited the Wahabi Amir at Riyadh. It was repeatedly subsequently alleged that some undertaking was then entered into by the Resident with the Wahabi Amir. There is nothing to support this (paragraphs 110-112). Subsequent to the visit, the Amir (paragraph 115), in reply to a protest against the activities of his Lieutenant at Baraimi, alleged that there existed between the Wahabi power and the British Government an agreement originally effected in the time of the late Saud and again ratified in the time of the then ruler. No trace of any such document or agreement could be found, and on the point being raised with the Wahabi envoys by Colonel Pelly they replied (paragraph 120) ' that the Wahabi Amirs had from, time to time received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that the Government considers a friendly letter to be synonymous with a treaty agreement' (1866). On 21st April 1866 a Wahabi representative volunteered the declaration recorded in paragraph 118 above. This was a unilateral i declaration. 232. It will be seen that, if the Wahabi declaration of 1866 is left out of account, there is no foundation for any suggestion that any treaty or agreement, whether affecting the Trucial Sheikhdoms or the hinterland, was concluded between the Wahabis and H.M. Government between 1800 and 1870. Nor was any engagement subsequently entered into until the formal treaty of 1915 between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, now superseded by the later Treaty of Jedda of 1927. No Saudi argument in regard to the Blue Line or the territorial limits of Saudi Arabia can thus be based on any engagement concluded prior to 1915 by H.M. Government. It is, on the other hand, a legitimate argument on the Saudi side, and one which they have not neglected, that no reference was made to the Blue Line in the lengthy discussions which preceded the conclusion of the Treaties of 1915 or 1927, and that the Anglo-Turkish Conventions were not communicated to them on the occasion of the latter treaty; though it is no doubt open to H.M. ' Government to argue, on the other side, that while as the result of their breach with Turkey they were prepared to ignore the Blue Line, and, as proposed on the initiative of H.M. Government, to agree to a subsequent territorial delimitation, the Blue Line, which was internationally legally binding, must be the starting point of any discussions designed to bring about a modification. (0) Status of the Trucial Sheikhs, and their relation to the Wahabis: 1800 ^ 1934. 233. H.M. Government, without consultation with or any protest by the i;C Wahabi Amir, in 1806 entered into an agreement with the Jowasimi Sheikh of J Ras-al Khaimah-Shargah for the suppression of piracy (paragraph 24 above). In 3076 N48 1820 (paragraph 34) they entered into a general maritime treaty with the predecessors of the present Trucial Sheikhs. They have maintained those treaty relations since that date and have supplemented them by engagements, either with individual rulers, or with the Trucial Sheikhs generally, regarding slavery and piracy in 1838 (Ajman, Debai, Abu Dhabi, Shargah); 1839 (Ras al KhaimahV 1843 (all Trucial Sheikhs); 1847 (all Trucial Sheikhs); 1853 (all Trucial Sheikhs)' 1864 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Debai, Umm al Qaiw r ain); 1868 (Abu Dhabi and Qatar); 1873 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi). In 1887 they secured 'exclusive agreements' from the Trucial Sheikhs, which were confirmed and strengthened in 1892, since when control of the foreign relations of these sheikhdoms has rested with H.M. Government. Further undertakings were obtained from the Trucial area in 1902; 1911-12 (pearling and sponge-fishing concessions); 1912 (Shargah- Tamb light-house); 1922 (oil). The treaty of 1820 and all subsequent treaties were entered into with the Trucial Sheikhs as independent States, and H.M. Govern ment, in so far as they have found it necessary to apply forcible pressure to the Sheikhs to ensure their compliance with the engagements accepted under those treaties, have done so without reference to, protest by (save in 1833—^paragraph 46 -above), or the prior sanction of, any other power. 234. Since 1823 H.M. Government have (paragraph 36) been locally repre sented by a native Agent, with headquarters at Shargah, of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Since 1932 the Trucial Coast has informally been placed under the supervision of the British Political Agent at Bahrein. The history of the period since 1800, as recorded above, illustrates the close contact consistently maintained with the Trucial Coast by the Resident, which inevitably arose from the obligations assumed by the Sheikhs and by H.M. Government under the Maritime Truce of 1820 (paragraph 34), and the subsequent engagements by which it was supplemented. 235. The historical survey above goes to suggest that between 1800 and 1870 the Trucial Sheikhs (but Abu Dhabi to a much less extent than the Jowasimis of Shargah), were for considerable periods under a large, though not consistently an effective, degree of Wahabi influence, if not control. But the important division in the area seems to have been that between the religious factions of the Hinawis (represented by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat) and the Ghafaris (represented by the Jowasimi Sheikh); the minor Sheikhs of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain, who normally co-operated with Shargah-Ras -al Khaimah, and of Dibai, who normally co-operated with Abu Dhabi, changing sides according as one or other of the two major Sheikhs seemed likely to assume a dominating influence. Wahabi influence declined in this area after 1853 and disappeared altogether, save as a purely religious movement, after 1870. It appears to have revived only in the period subsequent to 1920. The long breaks in the continuity of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman apart, it can fairly be maintained that the Trucial Sheikhs have throughout, in continental as well as in maritime affairs, been independent political entities, even if some of them were negligible in size, and if most, if not all, were by land responsive to or entirely under the influence at various times of the strongest neighbouring power, whether that power was Muscat or the Wahabi Amirs. It seems difficult in any event for Ibn Saud to base any substantial claim to suzerainty over these sheikhdoms or their immediate hinterland at this stage, merely on the broken record of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman during the period between 1800 and 1870, or on its revival in the period subsequent to 1920, at a date when he had by formal treaty engagements undertaken to respect the independence of these States. (D) Extent of Wahabi control in the area to the east of Nejd from 1800 to 1934. 236. From the historical statement above it will be seen that this has varied very greatly, both in degree and in area, and that there are considerable gaps in its continuity. From 1800 to about 1815 it appears to have been a fairly substantial control, less marked in the case of Abu Dhabi, extending as far east as the boundaries of Muscat and largely exercised from Baraimi. The same is true of the period 1831-33 until 1836, or possibly as late as 1838. From 1845 to 1853 Wahabi influence is again marked over the same area as before. Froin 1853 to 1869 it underwent a steady decline, and from 1869 until 1923 it is practically non-existent, though the Sheikhs react quickly to the fortunes of the pis it Liteat? jfi ^eiy sttdJi «y 't treat J HI J 49 ruler of Nejd (c^. paragraphs 138-9, 152, &amp;c.). At that point there are definite signs of revival, though, even so, the Trucial Sheikhs are divided among themselves, Abu Dhabi and Debai being opposed, like Muscat, to any such revival'; Ras al Khaimah and Shargah inclined to sympathise; and the remainder neutral. In the hinterland of the Trucial Sheikhs Wahabi influence appears to extend in an informal fashion as far east as the oasis of Baraimi, a minority of the tribes occupying it having paid zakat ; while Mr. Bertram Thomas and other travellers report that the Al Murra tribe of the Central Arabian Desert also defer to it. 237. The main test of the existence of this influence is the payment of zakat by tribes or rulers. No payments are now made by the Trucial Sheikhs, who, how- k ever, exchange presents with the Amir of Hasa. The local political authorities positively state that this payment is, in fact, a form of danegeld or blackmail, and does not connote any political subjection. ' The position seems to be that the Trucial Chiefs and the tribes fear j&gt;.3.4860/34. aggression from Ibn Saud and try to placate him, the former by presents of | courtesy, and by listening to representations, for example, in cases affecting his \ nationals, and the latter by paying zakat to him. But these arrangements are of recent standing, and merely indicate that for the moment Ibn Saud is j sufficiently powerful to make the payment of blackmail to him an appropriate/ insurance.'' ■ ;E I (E) History and position of Baraimi. 238. Baraimi was in the past the only important Wahabi settlement in the Trucial area. The oasis of which it is the centre is well watered, fertile and strategically of great importance, since it commands the approaches into the ' ,|! Sultanate of Muscat. It was captured by the Wahabis in 1800, and from that 'J® | date to 1869 was the headquarters of their representative in Eastern Arabia, mil with intervals during which it passed out of Wahabi control from 1818, or )rM slightly earlier, to about 1833; from 1838 to 1845; and in 1848-9. In 1869 it « was captured by the Sultan of Muscat, and appears never since to have been mtj reoccupied by the Wahabis. Its forts are at present held by the Beni Nairn, ofAjsj who appear to be hostile to the Wahabis, though a minority of the tribes who Safe occupy the oasis were reported in 1924 to have paid zakat to the Wahabi tax sa®- collectors. It will be seen that there is thus no history of continuous Wahabi a doll occupation, and that the oasis has not been under effective Wahabi control since d isffl 1869. )pea^ |l muh g (F) Extent to which the Wahabi Amirs and Ihn Saud have in the past professed allegiance to Turkey. 239. The Wahabi Amirs were decisively defeated in 1818 by the Egyptians, \k l and the Wahabi Amir himself executed at Constantinople. On the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824 and for some years afterwards, the then Amir Turki Salt appears to have paid tribute to the Viceroy of Egypt, and to have endeavoured r 'r to represent himself to the Viceroy (though not locally in Arabia) as the Viceroy's i# agent (paragraph 37). They were again decisively defeated by the Egyptians 3# in 1837-39, and the Wahabi Amir taken prisoner to Cairo. He was released by 0 the Egyptians and returned to Nejd in 1842. From 1839 to his death in 1865, it would appear (paragraph 90) that the Wahabi Amir paid tribute to Turkey, though, at any rate in the latter part of this period, through the Turkish ,, authorities at Mecca. 0 240. In 1855 the Wahabi Amir professed (paragraph 91), in writing, to be a Turkish dependant, and stated that he had made it clear to Mehemet Ali, when the latter approached him in 1837 with a view to securing his co-operation against the tribes of eastern Arabia, that he could do nothing without the approval of the Sultan. In 1859 the Wahabi Amir, again in writing, referred to treaties fv concluded in the past between him and the Sultan of Turkey. In 1866 the M | Waiiabi Amir (paragraph 92) made overtures, apparently almost simultaneously, to Great Britain and the Turks. But the overtures of his envoy were ultimatelv f IV f 1, : t 1 ! ' m : i;. / \\ (cp. paras, 145, 152, 164.) F.O. to I.O. 31.8.34. 50 241 In 1871 the Turks were called in by the Amir Sand, who subsequently became the head of the Wahabis. The negotiations between the Saudis and the Turks in the 10 years which followed appear consistently to have proceeded on the basis that the Wahabi Amirs, in return for Turkish support to enable them to re-establish themselves in Nejd and possibly Hasa, were prepared to accept Turkish suzerainty. In 1890 they professed their obedience to the Turkish authorities (paragraphs 125, 127, 128). Ibn Rashid, by whom they were finally defeated in 1888, and who, from 1876 to 1901, was the leading ruler in Central Arabia, consistently professed allegiance to Turkey. Between 1901 and 1913, Ibn Sand, while continually endeavouring to secure British protection and British assistance against the Turks, on various occasions appears to have submitted to Turkish authority (see in particular paragraphs 136, 137, 150, 151), to have drawn allowances from them for his father or himself (paragraph 141, but see paragraph 152), and to have settled tribal disputes on behalf of Turkey (paragraph 150). In May 1914, abandoning hope of the active assistance of H.M. Government, he concluded a treaty as ' Wali and Commandant of Nejd' with the Wali of Basra, 'who was specially empowered by imperial iradeh,' the text of which will be found in Appendix A, and which is only idfl (C f All OF ' Je 1. T jniaBt of rial Irad idant of jistsof 1 _ ilated ut of this 1 T i consistent with Ibn Sand's full acceptance of the status of a Turkish subject and I od official. It may be noted, too, that on the outbreak of the War, Ibn Saud did not repudiate allegiance to Turkey, but gave as an excuse for his failure to lend armed assistance to the Turks that he was engaged in hostilities with Ibn Rashid, while at the beginning of 1915 he hinted to H.M. Government that, failing a satisfactory written understanding with them, it would be necessary for him to make overtures to the Turks. 242. The true position is no doubt that, throughout the whole of this period, ' aKi A mire cnlplv rrinPArnprl with tbpir own intprpists wpirpi nrftmrpifl to ^ 1 ^ the Wahabi Amirs, solely concerned with their own interests, were prepared to give a formal acknowledgment of Turkish suzerainty or to pay a nominal tribute to Turkey if by doing so they could be assured of non-interference by Turkey in their concerns. From one standpoint it would be unreasonable therefore to attach undue importance to the acknowledgments of suzerainty constituted by the series of incidents referred to above. But it is on the other hand open to H.M. Govern ment in any dispute in which they may be concerned with Ibn Saud in which that ruler claims that he and his ancestors have for the last century been the indepen dent rulers of Nejd and Hasa, and that he is not the successor in title of the Turks in those areas, to take advantage of the very frequent and consistent reiterations of Wahabi allegiance to Turkey over almost the whole of the period.

On the limited issue of the continued validity of the provisions affecting j ^ ^ ^ the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 (paragraph 165) and 1914 (paragraph 179 above), the Foreign Office, at an earlier stage, expressed the view that the Blue Line remained internationally legally binding as against Ibn Saud. On the wider question of what precisely H.M. Government are legally entitled to maintain as against the King in regard to the Blue Line, they have since expressed the interesting and important opinions : — (a) That there is reason to believe that the territory immediately east of the Blue Line, on the assumption that neither H.M. Government nor any Arab State under their protection exercises any authority there, is at present either res nullius or (conceivably) in parts already under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud. (&amp;) That ' while we are perfectly justified to use the Blue Line and the position of Ibn Saud as the successor of Turkey, &amp;c., as much as we can in negotiating with Ibn Saud in order to secure the most accept able frontier possible in wording future agreements, I do not think we should win before a tribunal deciding the matter on legal principles if the issue was whether the area immediately east of the Blue Line local re fcndC 'Ns local ii Nofit, Nimt %et of i] •?W al was a part of the territory of the Sheikh of Qatar, a British protected i i principality, or, if it was res nullius, whether Ibn Saud was free to ) ;■ ^ acquire territory by occupation or prescription if he could produce evidence of the state of affairs necessary to support such a claim.'

Ras-al-K haimah.' TffliS 11. At the date of compilation of Lorimer's Gazetteer Ras-al-Khaimah aid was under the control of Sharjah and constituted the Northernmost district Kalkil in that principality. It has since again become an independent State. Lor. n, isk: It is described by Lorimer as ' divided from the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the 1004-5. tigiK Oman Sultanate on the North-East by a line which runs obliquely from Ras-ash- st® Sha'am on the West coast of the promontory to a point between the village of etoH Dibah proper and Bai'ah on the East coast. On the West, from Ras-ash-Sha'am on the North to the South end of Jazirat-al-Hamra on the South, it is bounded by the sea; and thence by a line, of which the course is indefinite, drawn across the is't : desert to the Southern extremity of the Jiri Plain. The South-East limit is an jOii imaginary line connecting the South end of Jiri with the East coast at a point immediately south of Dibah.' The town of Dibah and village of Wamm were at the date of Lorimer's Gazetteer exempt from the jurisdiction of the Deputy j or n 1007 ''''Governor (on behalf of Sharjah) and held in fief by a Wali who was first cousin ' ' of the Sheikh of Sharjah. oftk Independent Oman. 12. This consisted in 1905 of a small tract lying between the Oman Sultanate Lor. II, 1368 and Trucial Oman, consisting chiefly of the districts of Jau and Mahadhah ' which is not subject to any recognised ruler and may therefore be styled Independent '■al 1 Oman.' It includes the important oasis of Baraimi. 13. The boundaries of Jan are indefinite, but the tract embraces Jabul Hafit, Lor. II, with the villages near the southern end of that range. It includes, at its north- 931-3,' western and most important part, the oasis of Baraimi, which lies a little south of 260-5. a straight line drawn between the towns of Sohar and Abu Dhabi, about 65 miles west by south of the former and 85 miles east by south of the latter. The oasis is nearly circular and its diameter is about 6 miles. Its political position in 1905 was as follows : ' Baraimi is independent, but the influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in the district is strong and increasing. The ruins of the fort at Muraijib bear witness to the hereditary connection of his family with Baraimi, and he has 111S recently acquired and is now engaged in developing an estate at Jahali, while Masudi is being formed into a village by his eldest son. Moreover, a regular tribute ... is paid him by the Dhawahir, who are numerically a majority in the oasis. At the present time the Sheikh could probably seize Baraimi if he wished to do so, but his policy appears to be one of pacific penetration. The Nairn are the original owners of the oasis and possession of the fort in Baraimi village still gives them prestige and a local superiority over the Dhawahir. A few Manasir of the ^ Abu Khail section frequent the Baraimi oasis or its neighbourhood in summer.' U. Mahadhah is described as a plain in the heart of the Oman promontory, the ^ 1 0r -^ headquarters of the Beni Khab tribe, which, together with Jau, forms the greater ~ • 3 part of Independent Oman. Mahadhah is probably situated 15-20 miles north-east jflir' of the Baraimi oasis, but its exact position is uncertain. Its level is said to be \0'- somewhat higher than that of Baraimi and its extent is described as about 6 miles ad#! in any direction. 3076 P m aic54 APPENDIX 0.

Lorimer (1905) describes the Manasir as 44 a bedouin tribe of Trucial Oma whose headquarters are in Dhafrah. Their general range is from Qatar on tlr north-east to the Baraimi oasis on the east, and they are found all over DhaM but especially in Dhafrah proper and Limah and also' in Khatam. A few frequent the neighbourhood of Abu Dhabi town and visit the Baraimi oasis and someare settled in the coast villages of Khan and Jumairah. On the north the tribe arein contact with the Beni Hajir in the neighbourhood of Qatar, and further inland,! the west with the Al Murra ; their raiding parties sometimes reach Wadi Farua On the east their territory marches with that of the Beni Yas, with whom moreover they are intermingled in Dhafrah, and to the south of them the countrv ii uninhabited, being part of the Rub' al Khali. The Manasir, except those at Kki and Jumairah, are altogether nomadic. Most of them winter in Qatar or its noighboui liood and spend the summer in Uwall, where they have temporarj villages ot huts and some date groves possessed as tribal joint property. ... The total numbei of ^tlie tube is about 1,400 souls. . . . The Manasir were fornierk subject to the Wahabi Crovernment, and in 1865 were understood to pay a contri- mtion worth 2,000 dollars a year, chiefly in kind, into the Wahabi treasury. Now tiey &lt;iie independent of all control, but maintain some degree of intercourse witi the town ot Abu Dhabi and its Sheikh.' riic Admiralty Kandhooh of Arabia (May 1916) describes the Manasir as' a S1 p na independent tribe in the ill-known Dhafrah district, bordering on the domain o t ie sheikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom, if to anyone, they owe a vague allegiance, laving foi a generation or so been free of tribute to Ibn Saud.

The Amirs of the \¥ahabis sent frequent expeditions against the A1 Murra, but one only, led by the Amir Feisal, was partially successful. His force, however, reached the scene of action in such a feeble state owing to want of watei, that he was obliged to be satisfied with a nominal arrangement, and returned to Nejd vanquished rather than victorious. In connection with the postal service in the Hasa Sanjak the Turks pay small subsidies to the chief Sheikh of the A1 Murra. l^ut these do not avail to secure the good behaviour of the tribe, nor can any revenue be realised from them by the Ottoman Government. About 1865 the A1 Murra were paying the value of 3,000 dollars as revenue to the Wahabi Amir, and during the recent conflict in Central Arabia they supported the Wahabi cause, but they are not at present tributaries of Ibn Saud.' The Admiralty Handbook of Arabia {May 1916) describes the A1 Murra as Yol.

On the north they come up to near Oqair, while inland they lie south of the Hofuf-Riyadh routes, which they harry, as far as the borders of Kharj.

The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. A copy has been senP.Z.6059/34 . Note by GolonsI T.G. go v vle, C .B .E.. aated 21st Septamper i9b4 . With reference to the C.I.D» meeting of 13th instant on the subject of the Blue Line at which it was agreed that, provided Ton Saud was reaay to grant His Majesty's Government their desiderata, His Majesty's Government on their side were prepared to negotiate generously with him with regara to the Line, i.e. give him substantial concessions east of it. It was also agreed that a corollary of this policy mi^ht he that the large area of indefinite no man's land which at present lies between the territories of our clients (the Ar^b Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf including the Sultan of Muscat) ana the Sauai Empire might have to disappear; that the frontiers of the Arab sheikhdoms might have to be defined and drawn on the map (it would be impossible to ao so on the ground); ana that these frontiers ana those of the Saudi Empire would have to be coterminous. 2. since the meeting I have been giving this question of frontiers some further consideration, and have come to the conclusion that though these frontier lines will look very nice ana neat on the map, off the map ana in actual working practice they may be a considerable nuisance, if not a danger. Frontiers, while necessary elsewhere, in Arabia are merely necessary evils only to be drawn when unavoidable. The population of the country is nomadic - the tribes wandering considerable distances according to the season in search of water ^nd pasture ^ the average Arab 'Sheikh has a very vague idea as to where his territory begins ana ends^ and often there are no well-defined physical/4/ physical i eat ares along Wiiicu a 'boundary could conveniently oe placed. In tine eyes of the average /rral) - and when one is consiaering the creation of frontiers one must consider local pudlie opinion however unorthodox this may appear - a frontier is not so much geographical as triual and political. A Sheikh in answer to a Question as to how far his authority extends will rarely answer from A to B; he will say over such and such a trioe o ^• The advantages of the present situation, under which there are no fixed frontiers between the territories of our clients and Ion Baud's empire, are obvious. Where there are no frontiers there can be no encroachments. If, for instance, there is raiding and counter-raiding in the Arabian hinterland of the Trucial Coast, neitner our clients nor Ibn 3aud can apply to us. The matter is settled somehow or other between the two parties. Once however we draw definite frontiers - in itself a matter of great aifficulty and involving amongst other features the consent of our clients (including the Sultan of Muscat, juridically an independent sovereign) - the question will assume quite a different aspect, a raid or an encroachment across a frontier (which however clear on a map will be totally unintelligible to the tribes on the spot) by Ton Saud's Aedouin will be followed by an appeal from our injured client; while a similar raid or encroachment by one of our clients will be followed by a note from Ibn saud. In these circumstances it seems probable that we may be engulfed in a morass of complaints and counter-complaints, the net result of wnich will be not an entente with Ibn Saud, which is our object, but the reverse a- 3 - 4' Furtner - tiie drawing of fixed frontiers might well involve His ivajesty's Government in a measure of responsibility for protecting their clients by lana as well as 'by sea, (except for Kuwait ana the contingent assurance recently given to c^atar our defensive commitments to the other Sheikhs are limited to the sea only). Do His Majesty's Government want to commit themselves to maintaining the authority of the Trucial Coast sheikhs up to a line drawn in the interior far away from the coast? Lastly - Ion Saud, like the rest of us 9 must die some day. Noho-ay,, I think 9 knows exactly what will happen when he is gathered to his lathers. To meet this eventuality 'would not a more or less fluid situation be preferable to a static one? 1 certainly ao not suggest that the difficulties noted above shoula in any way hold up whatever steps can now be taken to negotiate an understanding with Ibn Saud, but I think they shoula be borne in mind a I think also that it might be possible to overcome them, while fixed frontiers are unavoidable between the Saudi Empire and countries such as Iraq and Transjoraan, I doubt whether they are essential between the Trucial Coast and the Saudi Empire. It might be possible once in a way to adopt the Arabian point of view, and make the frontiers tribal instead of geographical, and to say to Ibn 3aud: not that we agree that your territory extends up to such ana such imaginary line, but; we agree that your authority extends over such ana such tribes. The idea in itself (though on this point Sir Andrew Hyan is naturally the best authority) might appeal to Ibn Saua himself as falling in with Arab ideas, as/vg) - 4 - as giving him - ostensibly at any rats - plenty of elbow room, ana as avoiding fixed frontiers which arouse in most Arab rulers a feeling of pronounced claustrophobia. r/ '• 1 see one difficulty in connection with this tribal frontier suggestion and aoub11ess there are more• The tribes which Ibn Saua raises claim to may come much nearer to the coast than suits us. However I think the suggestion is worth exploring and one step in this direction would be - at some stage in the proceedings - to obtain from Ibn s^ua a list of the tribes in the hinterlana of the Trucial Coast and Oman territories which he claims to be under his suzerainty. Mien this list is available we will try and work out what are the rough geographical limits of tnese tribe SoWith reference to the C.I.'i). meeting on the 13th on the subject of relations with l'bn Saud and particularly the question of the Blue Line, the following are some coiaments of sain* in so ffir as the Persian Gulf area is concerned. (I have already giv©n my YiewB in more detail in my letter, Wo.594-S of 20th June last.) 2. The Persian Gulf coastal territory east of the Blue Line can be divided into dartre areas. (a) Jafurah - tha area iimediately south-west of . 4 atar. This con tail, s two hamlets, Sakak and Anbak. iach consists of a or 9 reed huts with a few palm trees. The inhabitants of this area, chiefly the A1 Llorrah, pay tribute to Ibn Saud (Colonel Loch 's report, para raph 2). (b) The territories of the Trucial Sheikha. The Sheikhs pay no tribute to Ibn Saud, but no, and then give him courtesy presents. (c) This consists of the hinterland of (b). The Monasir tribe of one section o; xhis ar39&gt; t 3hafurah, ..or the last four or five years have paid tribute to Ibn Saud (paragraphs 5 ^d 6 of Colonel Loch's report). (d) Baraimi. 1?or many years past the Wahabia o not appe''r to have kept a Resident Agent at Baraiid, and as long ago as 1^04 (see my letter Ho.5^4-S), the Shei/Ji of Abu Dhabi captured it from the Beni Bairn: i.e. from the local tribes, not from the Wahabis. (s) Territory of the Shaikh of Oman. here is no question of any Wahabi claim in this territory. 3. Since Ibn Saud exercises no regular rule over ne Persian Gulf territory east of the Blue Line, (such s, for instance, he exeJtciaes up to tiiat Line in uhe province of Hasa): his claims to any part o.. ^hat territory depend on the tribute which he extracts from it on/■ : i* i On the subject of such tribute ^_ u uriouxe, please see paragraph 7 o f my 1 et t er Ho • 594 ~S. 4. -lere seems to be some doubt as to our exact le^l noBition in regard to the Blue Line. j suggest that it might be worth while to get the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown on this question: not that I think we should necessarily adhere to the strict letter of the law in our dealings with Ibn S«ud # but it mirht be as well to loiow exactly what the letter of the law w-s. 5. With regard to Ibn Baud's desire for a comprehensiv. understanding with )!•: mG*, with a view to settling all outstanding questions. As far as the Persian Gulf is concerned 1 think such an understanding would be an exce j.mt thing. One of the most important outstanding questions is the iioweit blockade, and ibn 3aud♦ s treatment of tnis question would probably be an ♦acid test 1 of his sincerity in seeking H.M.G.'s friendship. 6. Any concessions given to Ibn Saud in the matter of the Blue Line should, r s 1 hssve previously suggested, be postponed if possible until the A.P.O.C. have obtained the Qatar oil concession. T.

Anglo-Saudi Relations. ; October 3, 1934. S ection 1. South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia.—{Record of Conversation with with Saudi Ministry on October 3, 1934.) FOLLOWING on the arrangements made at the second meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 20th September, the Saudi-Arabian Minister and Mr. Zada mailed on Mr. Rendel on the 3rd October ostensibly to inform him of King Ibn Sand's views in regard to the possible revision of the 11 blue line ' frontier. Sir A. Ryan and Mr. Johnstone were also present. 2. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba began by explaining that he had now heard from [bn Sand, and that the King considered that the frontier should follow existing ie facto line which had been tacitly, though not formally, agreed upon between tiimself and the Sheikh of Qatar as the southern limit of the latter's authority. This boundary, though never actually defined, had long been tacitly accepted and had never given rise to any trouble, and the King would be prepared to reach m agreement either with the Sheikh of Qatar direct or with His Majesty's Grovernment on this basis. 3. Mr. Rendel said that this was, of course, only a small portion of the frontier, but that it seemed to him that what the sheikh had just said was really begging the question. His Majesty's Government could not admit any line Dther than the ' blue line,' on the ground that it had been tacitly agreed to or accepted and had not given rise to difficulty. It was precisely because no agree ment had been reached about the frontier and because difficulties had arisen that the question was now under discussion. Moreover, His Majesty's Government were responsible for the foreign relations of Qatar; there could, therefore, be no question of a direct agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and Ibn Saud in regard to the frontier. The position was that His Majesty's Government regarded the 'blue line' as the legal south-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia. They were prepared as part of a general settlement not to take their stand on the strict letter of the law, but to agree to some modification of the line by mutual agreement. 4. What the Minister had said gave a fairly clear indication of what King Ibn Sand's desiderata might be in regard to the Qatar sector of the line. But it was even more important to know Ibn Sand's ideas in regard to the remainder of the ' blue line.' Fuad Bey, at the meeting on the 20th September, had spoken of claims to the areas inhabited by the Murra and Manasir tribes, and extending as far south as the Qara mountains. The claim to the Manasir might give rise to difficulties, and His Majesty's Government would certainly not be prepared to consider any claims extending as far south as the Qara mountains. What His Majesty's Government wanted to know was how far King Ibn Sand's claims really did extend. It would, for instance, obviously be useless to pursue the discussion if King Ibn Saud were putting forward claims extending right into the territory of Muscat. Before negotiations could be embarked upon, it was really important to know what the King was asking for. 5. The Saudi Minister said that he had received no instructions in regard to anything but the Qatar sector of the frontier. He understood that the King proposed to communicate his views to Sir A. Ryan on the latter's return to Jedda in December, when negotiations would be opened. 6. Sir A. Ryan pointed out that this carried us no further at all than the Saudi Government's last note on the subject. 7. Mr. Rendel said that His Majesty's Government considered it most important to have some indications of King Ibn Sand's claims and desiderata before Sir A. Ryan's departure. He repeated that the present position was that [231 c—1]N4 2 His Majesty's Grovernnient took their stand on the blue line, but that they would be prepared to make some concession in this aiea as pait of a general settlement. But before deciding whether any such settlement were possible, it was essential that they should know what King Ibn baud was asking for. If King Ibn Saud was claiming virtually the whole of South-Eastern Arabia, it might be useless to pursue the matter. In any case, it was necessary to issue detailed instructions to Sir A. Ryan for his guidance in carrying on any negotiations. These instructions would have to be elaborated in consultation with several other Departments of His Majesty's Government, and it would not be possible to consider them until His Majesty's Government knew what King Ibn Saud wanted in this matter of the south-eastern frontier. He therefore suggested that the Saudi Minister should telegraph to his Government and ask for telegraphic information on this question. 8. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba agreed to telegraph his Government forthwith, but said that the King would probably require time to make enquiries from the tribes, &amp;c., in the area in question. 9. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the King was apparently claiming an extension of his dominions to the east and south-east of the ' blue line,' on the ground that certain tribes inhabiting certain areas in this part of Arabia had always owed him allegiance. Surely the King must know which tribes owed him allegiance and which did not, and must already have the necessary information as to the areas which were inhabited by the former. King Ibn Saud could hardly claim the allegiance of tribes which he did not know or sovereignty over areas regarding the limits of which he was ignorant. 10. Sir A. Ryan added that King Ibn Saud knew more about this part of Arabia than anyone else, and must certainly already possess all the information required in order to enable him to formulate his claims. 11. It was agreed that the Saudi Minister should put these points to King Ibn Saud by telegraph, and communicate with Mr. Rendel again as soon as he received a reply. Eastern Defartment, Foreign Office, October 3, 1934. (it v • i: ;tf! ; k-p.A.,I am glad of the opportunity to read all these papers and to consider the question of tlie 'blue lino in its leg.*l aspects in the light of the much fuller information than was before rae on any previous oecasion. 1 # We start from tlie position that furlwey, by the treaty of 1914, article 3, which adopted article 11 of the treaty of 1915, accepted the hlue line as the limits of Turkish sovereignty in this part of the Arabian peninsula. From this it is clear that to the extent that Ibn Saud is the successor of the old Ottoman Empire in this part of the world and must 'base his claim on such oucceBSion, the 'blue line represents the limits of the territories whioh he acquired as Turkey's successor« I see that he was disposed to take the view that, even in 1913««»1914 Turkey was not the sovereign in this part of the world, that he ^as already then an independent power and that fux *3sey f a treaties '.-vere invtilid because she was dealing .ith no territories over which Bhe had/ sovereignty. fhis argument is, of course, disposed of by the treaty which Ibn Saud himself concluded with Turkey on the 15th May, 1914, ?ihioh I see recorded in the memorandum attached to E.4451# E. i l he foregoing however only amounts to -his, - successor of Turkey he could not claim beyond the blue line, and he certainly was the successor ox Turkey. But this is by no means the same thing as saying that Ibn Baud cannot, since that date, have acquired a sovereignty beyond the blue line, oi that/!U0 o £* 4 that His iiajQaty's SoTarnment possess eoTorelgaty right up to tiie blue line on the other side, or that any sheikh under their protection does so. 3. . duosequent questions for ooneideration fall substantially Into two olaeeces (a) the question whothsr by our subsequent treaty negotiations with Ibn baud His Majesty's Government have waived or lost any right tliut they maj otherwise have possessed to hold Ibn Laud's territories to be limited by tha blue line, and (b) whether, even if an affirmative answer is not returned to (a), it must be admitted that a substantial portion O -l tli© territory east oX the blue line is res MLLiiiiis thv :ref ore as such (i) open to acquiaition by occupation on the part of Ibn Saud, and ( U) not being unuer the sovereignty of His ivfajesty's Government or within the territory of any sheikh's under tiieir protection, is an area v ^he re His Majesty's Government have no legal right to object to steps being talc en by Ibn Laud in the direction of acquisition of sovereignty by occupation, even if he has not at present done sufficient to acquire a definitive title* 4, It must be ren^bered that under internati onal law territory is either under the sovereignty of a member of the faxsily of nations, or it is not| if it is not, then it is open to acquisition by occupation by another power. Spheres of influence in international law, whatever their political significance, mean nothing at all. If a state admits it has not sovereignty over a territory, but only claims a sphere of influence over it/i; 4 ;3., 3rv •, it, then apai't froiu treaty obligations 'binding particular powers not to enter the sphere of influence etc. legally any other power can go there and take steps to make itself sovereign. I am ■well aware that from the political point of view spheres of influence may have great importance. It may be a ground upon -mich representations -aay 'be made to another state that its action in ^oing there is provocatiYe and unfriendly, and that it must not be surprised if their action provokes the resentment and retaliation which :.iay follow upon provocative and unfriendly, hut nevertheless perfectly legal, acts. Legally a sphere of influence is of no effect at all unless you have a specific treaty with the power who is entering the zone, under which the latter has specifically undertaken not to do so. 6« The second point to 'be remembered is that under international law, to use the words oj. Hubei as arbitrator: 'Territorial sovereignty oaniiot be liaiited to its negative side'. sovereignty over territory oannot consist in a mere right to keep other states out when the soi diaant sovereign exercises no authority whatever there. If this is the position, then even 11 tiie soi disant sovereign had originally a perj-ectlj sound title, he will lose it if another state enters the territory and de facto exercises authority there for a sufficient period, and this acquires u, prescriptive right. 6. Applying theee principles to the case of the territory immediately to the east of the blue lino,it seeiae to be perfectly clear that neither His Majesty- s Qovernment nor any Arab state under their protection, ., „ - + xr + ^he shei-h of uatr in exercises any autnorxty tnere. •, i-iiro to claim the territory has whose name we should li^e apparently/4. apparently never attaaipted to exercise authority up to the blue line, and may be even oompleteiy unaware that we are, as it were, attempting to incorporate it into his principality. Turkey, Ibn Saudis predecessor,did, it is true, impliedly agree in the 1914 treaty that the territory east of the line belonged to the sheikhdom of i v atr, 'but I do not think that even against Turkey this Treaty would mean that Turkey had undertaken not to cross the line, and acquire sovereignty there 'by occupation if, in fact, the territory was res nullius 5 and the Sheikh of ...atr and His Lajesty's Qoverniaent did nothing to establish themselves there. Still less, I think, could it be said that this treaty had this le-ai effect as regards Ibn Saud as Turkey's successor. The facts being .vhat they are, 1 thine it is impossible really to establish that the area in fact belonged uo the Sheikh of atr in 1914, and if this is so, I see no ground upon which His Majesty 's G-overniaent could have established any title to it at that li .:.e. It waa ree nullius . The position is clearly weaker today because there is certainly some evidence that Ion baud has in fact to some extent established his own authority tnere (see K.1448). I am not attempting to advise now whether the amount of authority Ibn Saud has exercised up to this date is sufficient to give him a title by occupation or prescription, or whether it is onxj a state of affairs which will produce this result in time, if his present authority there is raaintained am iijoreased. 7.15. Iftic 7. On thes?e groimde 1 think thr-t the territory insnedi ^tely enst of the blue line is at present either reB nulliue, or (conceivrbly) in prrts already under the sovereignty of Ibn Br-ud. 8. The eeeond p ^rt of the case against His aj enty 1 s Government when they eeek to naint^in thrt the olue line represents to-riry the li ^r .its of I'bn BfiUd 1 8 dominions {as opposed to those which he could claim g»fj succe «?^or to Turkey) is 'b^sed upon the subsequent agreements r.n6 negotiations with aim in 1 15, 192° pnd 1927. It is true rs Sir A.Hysn states, th t the agreements of 1915 exuX 1927 appear to proceed upon the basis thft Ibn 5aud•a territories and those of the Sheikh of atr etc. ere co~t er? f inous, i.e. that there i o no vr cuum between therr*, but this seems to - e to be «jn rrgu^ent which cuts both vays, though of course it does dispose of «ny case built up on n British sphere of influence as opposed to territory belonging to the dominions c : the iheirch ol str. But from the le 'si point of view, the sphere of influence argument wre clearly hopeless in any case, and sny substantial use of it seems to be merely sn admission of weakness on our p ^rt nnd s virtual gi vin ; away o »• ^ny legal case th »t we may have. It is, of course, an sr^ument a-ainst His Majesty's Government that in nogoti sting the 1915 agreement no mention whatever is made of the blue line. It is not by rny means conclusive, because the agreement of 1915 proceeds on the footing thst the boundaries of ibn ^eud on one- hand ^nd Q,fttr on the other sre sll to be delimited by sgreement/5. agreement. The most thRt can be said im that the 19X5 agreement ''pp@s.'ra to proceed on tbe esstimption tHpt in t:'i6 ' uture delimit^tion by «^rewent the criterion should ba the areas over wKich Xbn Seud and hi* predecessors -nd the Sheikh of Q.atr etc. possessed in the past, and this rather suggests thp.t we did not think the blue line agreement with Turkey ws . b neceaEsrily to be relevant. This is?, of course, not conclusive, because it may well be that Ibn iaud Ftnd his predecessors could not really establish clsiras on pisst history to territory crossing the blue line or even coming anywhere nenr it, and we would not put the blue line into the agreement because we were not then prepared to ^dmit that be could establish n claim th t even went as far as this. 1 doubt very much if the 19^7 treaty carries the matter rny further. The 19^2 agreement relates to an area which is so far distant from the blue line tb.i t it c*m hardly be s^id to be directly relevant ®t all. The most that can be said about it is thrt the frontier with Koweit there agreed upon is quite different from that laid down in the treaty with Turkey of 1913 **nd once again the arrangements with Turkey do not appear to h?ve been taken as the basis for fixing the new frontiers. The argument rlone ie not, I think, very conclusive, but is, of course, a straw which acquires some force when added to other indications of the same kind. ¥ ore nearly relevant pre the lines dr ^wn by Sir iercy Cox in 1922 at U 'quari actually in the rrers concerned ($.1513 s para. 4 of the India/\lfi&gt; Indift Office wworanduiB)* Sir i 'ercy Cox drew s lit e indicating what he considered then to be Xbn Saud's limits, which follows quits a differant course from the blue line, «icl this is perhaps a rather strong indication that the 1915 agree®wit with Ihn Saud did not mew the hlue line to be relied upon when the frontier delimitation contemplated by that agree .ent was taking nloca. 9.

' } Forwarded with the coinpliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. By Air Mail.^ Hls Majesty's • ^ Minister ^ t ]Rgggr: ^ — V \r ;:&gt; 1. By the Treaty of 1915 we undertook to recognise Ibn Baud's sovereignty over his ancestral dominions. This was part of our policy of using the Arab desire for liberation from the Turkish ycke as an Allied weapon against the Turks. wo endorsed by Implication the thesis that the Turks had been holding*the Arab countries in duress. 2o It ensues from 1. that Ihn baud's ancestral claims must be considered with reference to the period 'between the fiFst period of Saudi expansion and the ra-establishment of Turkish rule in Arabia in and absut the eighteen seventies. It is therefore material^to know what was the position of the house of Baud in the country east and south-east of Nejd during that period, which may perhaps he narrowed to the period from 1809, when we went for the Trucial Sheykhs, and 1865, the year of the Pelly mission. 3. European criteria of sovereignty cannot he applied to the Arabia of a hundred years ago.. The limits of what we call sovereignty were the limits of effective authority at any given moment. Its basis was not the holding of specific territories, a word then without meaning in seas jf tfesert, but....m),. but religious and tribal influence. The Imarnate oi IvjUS Celt would appear to have niaintainod its religious and political independence during the material period, ihe irucial bheykhs on the other hand had errihraced wahhabism 'be-Lore 1809 and seeiri to have been regarded by us in and after that year as the advanced posts of a militant political power founded on Vrnhhabism* It is a natter for further historical inquiry, whether they, and more especially their hinterland with which we are now concerned, were subject to or merely under the iniluence of the Beni Baud at crucial moments, e 6 g&lt;, at the moment of the Pelljr mission. 4. By the agreements of 1^13 and 1914, we recognised Turkish sovereignty, without reference to the claims of any local Arabs, up to the blue ana violet lines. The Turks renounced any claims to sovereignty east and south- east of those lines and recognised implicitly that the country beyond them constituted a British sphere of influence 0 This influence was dependent on the position we had built up during the nineteenth century as quasi- protectors of Muscat and the Trucial Sheykhdoms, 5«... &lt; li | il !R c/ « As regards the Trucial Sheyklidoms, we re- af±irmed oar special position 'by our agreement with Ibn Saud in 1916 but we took no steps to dertermlne 'boundaries and we allowed Ibn Saud to extend his in fluence well into the hinterland of the Sheykhdoms^ We made no attempt between 1915 and 1933 to assert that he was limited by the blue and violet lines as such, .though we maintained the principle that lie must not encroach on the Trucial Sheykhdomso Whatever may be the boundaries the Sheykhdoms must m my view be regarded as being conterminous with Ibn Saud's domlaions. We cannot reasonably claim that any past transactions have created a British sphere of influence independent of both. If we asserted such a clairri on technical legal grounds un^ intelligible to the Arab mind, we should be regarded by all Arabs alike as imperialist invaders worse than the Turks and we should be undertaking commitments impossible of fulfilment s if the intervening area should become important, e 0 g a as a theatre of economic enterprise^ 7o It would be merely absurd to claim that the disputed area is a sphere of influence of any of the coastal rulers. If we are determined to exclude Ibn Saud from It at all costs, we must go the whole hog and claim that it is the actual territory, as yet undivided and undelimited 5 of the Sultan of Muscat and/or the Trucial Sheykhs* 8 t I conclude that our objective should be an entirely new settlement with Ibn Saud, taking into account (a) his invincible hostility to any recognition * ill4. of past Turkish rights or pretensions; ,'5 (b) the absolute necessityin my view, of regarding the coastal states as being conterminous with Saudi Arabia; (c) the fact that, if we or the coastal rulers had valid claims to the disputed area in 1315, we have allowed them to go by default by our tolerance of Ibn Saud 1 s extension of his influence in the hinterland of the Trucial Sheykhdoms; and (d) the desirability of using such technical legal rights as we can claim, less to confine Ibn Baud territorially than to ensure adequate Pritish partici pation in future economic enterprises in the disputed area and a free run for our aircraft along the Persian Gulf coast, 9, As regards technical legal rights we may well bear in mind what the future Duke of Wellington said in 1804:- 'I woula rather sacrifice Gwalior, or every frontier of India, ten times over, in order to preserve our credit for scrupulous good faith, and the advantages and honor we gained by the late war and the peace; and we must not fritter them away in arguments, drawn from over-strained principles of the law of nations, which are not understood in this country . There is no doubt that the attempt to impose on Ibn Saud the blue and violet lines after twenty years of silence regarding them can only strike Ibn Saud as an attempt to trick him by legal subtleties today cuo of what we led him to expect when we wished to enlist his support in downing the Turks, then our enemies and always the enemies of his race* He is never likely to give us an unreserved friendship but our policy is to «.«\5\: to keep him our friend as Tar as we can do so by affording nim moral but/ not material support. We must sometimes be firm with him but we should never do anything avoidable to inflame his suspicions or to drive him to seek the support of other powers* (Intld.)

'M &lt; i; ' i » ' Note on Bin Sauces attltudQ at the tT 0qair tT meetinp; w ith Sir Percy Cox in November 1928- with special regard to the question of what he considered the .bast form of boundary between Iraq and Ke.jd. / . % « m. i As ordered by you I beg to submit the following note which I give from my memory, 2. I was sent down to Bahrain in September 1922 from Baghdad with special instructions from the High Commissioner to get into touch with Bin Saud and persuade him to come down to the coast, with a view to his meeting the High ✓ Commissioner. The special point for discussion and if possible for settlement was to be the Iraq-Nejd Boundary. 3. During the previous Spring a series of raids by Nejd tribes into Iraq territory, and an equal number of counter raids by Shammar sections, v /ho had not accepted Bin Saud T s overloz^dship, and had taken reiuge ir.. the Hilla Liwa had brought the need for some sort of 'Modus YI7ENDI' to the fore. 4. The first raid, counter raids, and subsequent political anti Bin Saud propaganda in Iraq were almost identic al in form and method to those which we later scw in the Autumn and Winter of 19 27-1928. 5. Few people realized, I think, especially certain British and Arab officials in Iraq that uhe trouble was almost entirely an 'economic ' one. -i-t • ^ro-zated course, by the unfortunate personal hostility which existed between King Faisal and Bin Saud. 6. It is a well known fact that the Northern and North-Eastern Bedouin tribes of Nejd and epeciall: Ajman, Harb, Mutalr, Sharrlnar, Awazim and nearer Iraq and Dhafir, cannot, support themselves in their own oountiy and must, of a necessity, as they have done for hundreds of years, migrate each year during the Autumn months towaras the Euphrates and Kuwait in order to oh am certain neoessitiei10./ f 9 ** / of life. These come under three main heads: (a) Dates (b) Rice (c) Grazing for their camels at the end of the hot weather along the rich ;one lying to the outh of the Euphrates from Kerbala to the Persian Gulf. 7, The above also applies to the '.astern 'Anaze' tribe in the North, but because of the fact that certain of their Shaikhs own land round Kerbala they came under the category of Iraq subjects and so need not be discussed here. 8, The routes and tribal sectors of the Euphrates tapped by the Shammar, Ajman, Earb, I'utair, Awazim and Dhafir etc., in their annual marketing migration have been from time immemorial approximately as follows (1) Shammar moved up towards Shinafiyah (near Nejf) and Samawah. (2) The Harb ditto. (3) The Dhafir towards Nasriyah and Suq esh Shuyusk. (4) Mutair towards Kuwait (5) The Ajman towards Kuwait and Zubair. (6) The Awazim towards Kuwait. 9, The methods adopted have always been the same. The Bedouin first sent presents in to the powerful i/erain tribes (to the Muntafiq Saadun Shaikhs when the latter were strong) and asked permission to come up and camp near the river (usually this was about SO miles away) ..''here i .ell water was good. From these camps they would ^abil in oixe continuous stream up to the towns and tribal village- o.long Euphrates to make their purchases. Permission /vas never refused as both sides benefitted. The - esei : man brought money and camels while his Euphrates cou iterpart P rid his surplus dates, barley and rice, and incidentally his suo'olies of rifles and ammunition.10. ^or the river tribes to have denied to the Bedouin, permission to pass upto the Euphrates for their 'Musabila' would have been tantamount to a declaration of war and trouble would have resulted. But this rarely happened and only if great heads of States, like the Amirs of Hail, the Sauds, the Saadun Shaikhs of the Muntafiq etc, were at enmity, as they sometimes were in the old days. 11. The point always to remember is that the Euphrates towns and tribes (I include Iluwait also) always welcomed the annual migration, while the Wejd Bedouin have always looked upon Iraq and Kuwait as their natural shopping centres at the end of Summer and beginning of /inter, when grazing is scarce in their homeland and a distant move becomes imperative. 12. In my opinion a serious error was made at Ojair in 1922 v/hen an arbitrary boundary of /estern type was decided on between Iraq and Wejd, which resulted ultimately in Bin Saud for the first time in History almost restricting the annual natural movements o 0 Nejd tribes towards the North. A much better, in fact the only solution to my mind, apart from a continuous line o^ i eutral ^one, would have been to have adopted what we know as a tribal boundary; that is to say so many whole tribes going to r.ejd and so many others to Iraq and Kuwait right along the proposed frontier line from the Persian G-ulf to I'ransjordan. 13. X I mention the above as at the Ojair onference mentioned at the beginning of this note. Bin baud himself fought very hard indeed for a solution on these lines, ana I myself had bitter experience as Political Officer, Muntafik, of the futility of the old Turkish arbitrary boundaries between LIWAS and onlv founa relief xrom Inter-LI7A tribal fighting when (I jas able to persuade) , C f\\ CWVUJ, f/K ■''Vvw ,/Vl Sir Percy cS(to allow me to adopt) tribal boundarie^ 14./^ 1^1 14. At the Ojair Conference in question which was attended by Bin Saud, Lir Percy Cox, the Minister of Public Works (for Iraq) and Abdul Latif Pasha al Hendil of Basra (un-official adviser to Bin Saud), I distinctly recollect that Bin Saud started off by insisting that the Dhafir, an Iraq tribe of Bedouin, was his and that it was necessary for his boundary to extend right up to the Euphrates not because he wished to control that river, but because the Dhafir as well as his big bedouin tribes actually moved up annually to the Euphrates and would never be denied right of access, which was a question of life and death for the desertman. Then it was pointed out by Sir Percy Cox that this claim was a ridiculous one and could not be discussed. Bin Saud gave in over the Dhafir tribe and adopted the more reasonable line that to safeguard the rights of his own tribes and prevent future trouble there should be a tribal boundary » r a (rri&lt; L ■■ described by the svstem of wells e£ and grazing grounds owned A by each tribe. This, he said, would be easy as everyone was aware of these, and each tribe from the days or: Abraham knew exactly which were its wells and grazing grounds and which were not. That is to say he advocated for instance that the Southern-most wells claimed by the Anaze, Ahafir and ^uwait tribes (excluding Mutair, Awaiim and Ajrnan which he claimed) should form the boundary, while any wells known to be common property (such existed between Anaze and jjha ir, and between Dhafir and Mutair tribes) were to be declared neut 'al. 15. hen asked how the claims to these wells were to be proved Bin Saud retorted that the Desert world knew them as clearly as the light of day, and moreover tribal T, Wosems rT or marks, existed on the inner walls of almost all of them, and in the unlikely event of a dispute arising in the matter the n Ahl el IChibra^ or wise men with knowledge, could put the matter right. In any case bin oaud mciintc.ined th^ _i ht of Nejd tribes to go up to the Euphrates to make their annual purchases. A The Iraq representative^ Subhi Beg when asked his(\'S\ - 5 -• his views on a proper frontier declared for a time at least 200 miles South of the Euphrates, and insisted that Iraq would accept nothing else, 16. Sir rercy Cox attempted the ''via media 1 but could not get 'in 3aud to budge an inch from his 'tribal boundary ,, idea. Eventually at a private meeting at which only Sir i'ercy Cox, Bin ;.aud, and I were present, Sir Percy Cox lost all patience, over what he c lied the childish attitude of Bin Gaud, and we had the astonishing si -ht of Bin Saud being ft told off ?T like a naughty Schoolboy by H.M* s High Commissioner and being told sharply that he, Sir ''ercy Cox, would himself decide on the type and general line of the frontier line. This ended the impasse. Bin Laud almost broke down and pathetically remarked that Sir Percy Cox was his father and mother who had made him and raised him from nothing to the ^osition he held, and that he would surrender half his kingdom, nay the whole, if he, Sir ercy Cox, ordered. He ended by agreeing that 'dr ercy Cox should himself decide for him this vexed question. 17. The existing boundary as we know it resulted, it was drawn up practically by Sir -ercy Sox himself with a few suggestions here and there by Dr.Abdullah Jamluji, ecretary to Bin aud, TIajor Sore and myself. Bin Saud took little further p r ',rt in the discussions as far as I can remember and the map showing the 'inal selected line was later put before him for /'inal approval by Dr.Abdulla. ajuon.;; Oonei.* interested spectators these far reaching events were Amin Saihani and Sajor ' olme s. 18» r he disap ointed Bin Sauc. feeling no doubt that he had been outwitted by the Iraq delegates and Sir i j ercy Cox, and that the problem had been settled ocording to European standards and not by methods '.hat v /ould he: ve been understood by the ... jt bian world, would appear to have from that day decided on a po icy of slowly but surely div ;r ing^ V ^ diverting froia and preventing his people from having their old and time hono-ired corr.unication -ith either Iraq or Huwait and triad to force them to get their necessities of life and daily re uirements from Ojair, : atif and Jubail, his :orts, instead. 19. I'o doubt also he was -aided by the fact that for political reasons and to prevent intrigue, it were better to prevent i trioos ^ i v . r l: - c.i ? ; c , co t ot ith States which he felt were not friendly. ut natural lines of trade cannot thus be lirhtly interfered with or laid aside and as a result of this policy, we have seen nothing / but trouble. ~ad Bin ..auc. left well alone, it is not improbable that we should never have had the ...khwan Rebellion pf 1929-30, or the friction between Iraq and II©jd which preceded it, not to mention the long drawn out agony of the Kuwait Blockade. - 80, As regards the question of ^ixing some sort of a boundary between If in Jaud and the .'racial ..•oast tribes, resulting from the new Blue Line policy: If i may say so, I consider the only sensible way to settle such problem would be to have a tribal boundary. As a preliminary, the Hurra tribe must be acknowledged to be Bin oaud's, anc ne must be asked what other tribes he claims in tne hinterland. I LXXa. 4 %£. The Trucial Coast tribes are those making up the . ani Tas A and Jowassim confederations. -hey include uhe vaiious trucial coast towns and hamlets right up to .^atar. in Saud must be told in any agreement come to^something in the following lines: (a) He must respect the tribal wells and gr:zing zones in the interior used from time immemorial by the Trucial Coast tribes and their Shaikhs. (b) Both his and the Trucial Coast tribes may pass into each others territories in search of grazing when necessary, without let or hindiance. (c) Saudi tribes should at all times nav^ the .. i^htright to .usabilah' to the Coast towns (i.e. ju ./ their isions tner©/ , a,nd ii6i'th.©p h© nor the trucial coast Chiefs must prevent such operations unless carried out in a non^friendly and ^peaceful manner. (d) The tribes of either Saudi Arabia or of the Trucial Coast if erasin • in each others country to be liable to pay Zikat to either Bin Saud or the Trucial Coast .haikhs as the case may be. Some clauses should also be ta]&gt;?en to insure that Bin Saud JU-A. opes not order his big tribes to settle permanently in Trucial Coast territory, simply by way of bullying s though if left to themselves they will of course give no trouble. 2^. It is an axiom that Eejd tribes will never voluntarily want to hurt coastal towns or their tribes anywhere in Arabia, as they draw supplies from them, and do not want their I.iusabila stopped. Any trouble will |4 e*-*&lt; ' always be caused by the ruler who can brin^ pressure in A f this case Bin Saud. ^ 21.

With reference to India Office telegram No.2479, dated the 20th October -L934, I enclose extracts from Bertram Thomas* report on the Trans-Oman reconnaissance of 1927. In view of the length of the report I have omitted those portions which are not relevant to the purpose for which I presume the report is required - investigation into the extent of Saudi influence amongst the hinterland tribes oi South iiast .rabia. I am sending copies of this letter and ol its enclosure to Metcalfej Hyan, Loch and Bremiaer. hn-'' J. G. Laithwaite esquire, The India Office, London.The prestige of Ibn Saud in Peninsula Oman is in direct proportion to his strength and ability to harm it. There is no foundation for believing that some of the tribes being so-called Wahabis, they desire the extension to themselves of the Imam f s full temporal authority. The Hanbali sect to which the Dhahirah tribes in a large measure belong, is not, as practised here, essentially different from the Maliki or Shafi orthodoxy. Inherited from a time when it took a narrow and fanatical fom and imposed at the point of the sword, i t is now whittled down to a moderateness and toleration that make it unrecognisable as ^ahabism. So-called co-religionists of Ibn Saud, these tribes are inveterate smokers, though as a relic 01 past proscription, they do not as a rule grow 'the weed' in their own territory • They would not gladly sutler the introduc tion of the rigid tenets of Riyadh. On the other hand Ibn Saud they cannot defy. Hopelessly divided against themselves into the Hinawiyah and Ghafiriyah factions, unable or unwilling to unite or sacrifice separate tribal sovereignty which is the genius of their system, it is only Ibn Saud who in the past hundred years has been able to invade and dominate them under a single authority at Baraimi. They know that it is only he who may desire and is able to do this again. But it is not invasion that they fear which prompts them to pay 'zakat*. This spectacular method, which the first invader, Abdul Aaiz the ..ahabi, used at the beginning of the Nineteenth century is no longer necessary. To-day it is the power of letting loose a strong tribe to raid a weaker Dhahirah one ana carry off its camels without hope of redress or retaliation that is Ibn/;T3 r\ a': inKi ;i ■, •2- Ll Ibn Saud^ strength. Thus immediately before the arrival of Ibn Saud's zakat collector, one of the Bani Yas tribes was raided by the Al Murra and lost a hundred and fifty camels. Payment of zakat to Ibn Saud is therefore a kind of insurance against the raider. It is the wisdom and economy . of the present Abdul A^i^ to bring his insidious pressure to bear on a wavering tribe through a strong and loyal neighbour whose interest it is to be ensured the fruits of victory. Mindful of the lessons of the ruthless if intermittent Wahabi occupations of the Dhahirah, trie people of Peninsula Oman do not belittle the man of Riyadh who to-day has repeated the e^loits of his forerunners, but they do not love him. In reality it is not Ibn Saud himself whom they desire to propitiate but his viceroy Ibn JftXuwi, Lrovemor at Hofuf, whose activities extend to these Eastern marches. Tinder this lighter regime Ibn Saud 's influence does not as it did in 1800 penetrate into the Oman oultanate or even to Wadi Jizzi, nor does it reach the Coast as it aia at oharjah in thejEighteen Sixties. Its design seeras to be to bring the 3a4uin camel tribes of the Dhahirah - the Minasir, Mizariya', Bani Yas baduin, Ma'im, Albu Shaffiis, Dhuwahir, DaruS Awamir, Bani Ka'ab and 3ani ^itab - to acknowledge a nominal degree of subordination and pay zakat without trouble or expense, or military measures calculated to rouse their antagonism. Clearly the tribes in close proximity to Hasa e .g. Minasir and Mi.ariya' are unable to resist, those further removed, the Bani Yas Badu (who derive strength from their coaBtal connections), the lla'im, huwahir and Daru' are in a stronger position, while the . r, a n-j + a-h aresufficientl^ remote to say Bani Ka'ab and Bani ^itab aresunx^j. jr . ^ t -^ SauC i to demand from the 'No 1 .

The mazakki this year, one Muhammad bin Mansur of the Murra 1 tribe, collected zakat on the following basis. One dollar on each camel from the ^uwar' i.e» one year caniel upv/ards. One dollar on each ten head of sheep ana goats. Poor caravaners were exempted and remisGions were made to the moneyless Awamir. The I)aru ? paid very little and the Bani Ka f ab and Bani ^itab not at all. But behind the zakat collections, the power of Ibn Saud to turn one of these tribes within his influence on to another, its possibly hereditary enemy, and the fear felt within a tribe of its being left in isolation, give him an undeniable prestige. When these facts are realised the volte face of Shaikh Eaqer after premising you support for the Royal Air Force Expedition (Ibn J aluwi is inwardly not on good terras with him) ami the initial terror of ohaikh Salim of the Bani Ka'ab to harbour the aoyal Air force party , will appear to be acts of self -preservation and give the observer pause before condemning.# DHAHli&amp;T AL SIR» s ft i i ■ '') Thus the situation in Jau, or the Baduin northern I ha if of the Dhahirah. The southern half of Dhahirah starting at Dhank is called XR* • i - ts inhabitan' are chiefly settled and mainly belong to the Ghafiriyah faction and the Ibadhi sect. Ibn Saud has made no overture here and his agent would be unwelcome in any of its chief towns Ibri, Sulaif, Al Araqi, Ainan or Jari^. It will be remembered that in December 1925 the Imam of Interior Oasn, and Shaikh Isa bin Salih invaded and overran Jahirat al Sir. T.-oiat Wahabi encroachments Ostensibly their object was to resxs n , 0 n t.o threaten Oman Proper itself. 'Aben which were believed to ^nreaoew their/ fi u * --4- ■\ &gt; „: v 5. v I, ' A, :ri'h...X •ji' i si their move was seen however to involve worse implications, namely the subordination of Sir, predominantly Ghafiriyah, to a Hinawiyah hegemony, misuncierstandings arose am the army melted away. Sulaiman bin Harayar, Ghafiriyah, defected at the instigation of his co-factionists on the opposition side, and the Imam and Isa were obliged to abandon the expedition. Siraimi and Dhahirat at Jau generally, iianabi t in sect and Ghafiriyah in politics, would never tolerate the extension of Hanawiyah and Ibadhi influence into Dhahirat al Sir. In the event of a Vfahabi invasion in strength I opine that Dhahirat al Sir would follow the lead • of Dhahirat al Jau, which must submit* but spasmodic zakat collections alone, which represents the present measure of Ibn Saud 's interference in the Dhahirah, will not suffice to draw Dhahirat al Sir to his allegiance, ^ach small settlement prefers its independence, inclining in times of trouble to some historical local alliance. Thus Ibri has an historical link with the Hiyam tribe of Sulaiman bin liumyar. Sulaif looks to the Daru'. Al Araqi had in times j^ast a distant understanding with Al Hamriyah. Ainain and l)ariz, the only Kinawiyah elements, lean towards the Imam and Isa bin Salih. .iinam is strategically the Southern gateway of Dhahirat al bir, but Ibri, surpassing even Biraimi, is the great commercial centre and bazaar of the Baduin. WADI i ;»■' ■ JIZZlI ) There remains the tribal situation of Itadi Jt^i. To the foreign invader the open settlements of the Dhahirah present an easier and richer reward than these poor and inaccessible mountain settlements. The tSfUs** of the rt'adi Jizzi, Muqabil, ^unud, uadadna, .usx.aa.aat and Shuwamis are generally speaking small and relatively un important, Shafi in religion and Ghafiriyah. HeferMice has/has already been made to their villages (See Part l.tu): but the forwarding ol the Air Route may given them an importance which they otherwise would not have. In the lower part of tfadi Jizzi below Khan they come under the jurisdiction of Muscat, above it their independence is rendered nominal by the internecine strife which drives them to seek alliance ; either with the Na'im or Bani Ka^b, abks and ) Att UKITIOK ) Omitted.(f) Tribal considerations and the Air Rout^ i7&gt; It is understood that the Royal Air Force officers are recommending the route Auhi - Mahadhah - Abu Dhabi instead of Sahar - Biraimi - Abu Dhabi which is a longer distance and lies to the south (see map). Tribal opposition to the air route falls into two categories (a) coastal (b) interior. The coastal tribes' opposition will in the face of our sea-power break down the moment that it is decided (i) that the Air Route must happen (ii) that co-operation to this end will materially benefit them and that obstruction will materially harm them. Their recent action, calculated to induce us to despair of the obstacles and abandon the project, is the only card they have to play. If and when they see that they have to concede they will concede gracefully. Interior tribal opposition is not so easy. It is bound up with the Ibn Sa'ud Question, ion baud 's nebulous position in the Dhahlrah will have to crystallise before the Baduln tribes can be expected to take a definite line. The question of whether Imperial Air Route interests will uest be served by (a) Government recognition o^ ibn 3aud's position in reninsula Oman, or (b) Ibn Saud's entire exclusion therefrom, does not come within my purview. But it can be stated definitely that his present half and half position there militates against any of the interior tribes co-operat ing with us. They do not know where they stand. In this connection it would seem that as Ibn Saud can already collect iiakat by moral force the present indeterminate position suits him. His own interests do not require his risking tribal opposition by an attempt to obtain complete sovereignty over the area. This has an important bearing on what I presume to/to 'be the vital position along the air Route, namely the half way landing ground at Mahadnah in 3ani Ka'ab country. 1 tentatively sounded Shaikh Salim about the Royal h±r Force usiAb this place as a landing ground. He said he was friendly disposed but pointed out the difficulties. (i) the Ibn Saud question, and his own fear that he will fall between two stools. (ii) he could never agree to foreign troops being quartered there, or to buildings, or any action which would discredit him in the eyes of the Arabs, (iii) he could never agree to Mahadhah being used in operations against Arab tribes. I pointed out that these views were based upon a misconception of the objects we sought. As regards the first point. Shaikh Salim s opinions deserve attention# His support of the Royal Air Force party when other Dhahirah tribes were rallying to Ibn Saud's Agent is not likely to have endeared him to Xbn Saud: his opposition to Ibn Saud's claims in the Dhahirah are wexl known: to allow Bani Ka'ab territory to be used by our aero planes is calculated to estrange Ibn Saud still further and result in his being raided by Dhahirah tribes acting unaer instructions. In such circumstances he must walk warily. If, he asks, as a result of satisfying our Air demands ne exposes himself to these risks will *e afford him assistance or protection in certain eventualities Shaikh Salim before he is able to agree to our proposals will therefore want to gixow how he stands vis k vis Ion Saud. Ii he satisfied on this point he said he is disposed to agree. Should the Trans -Oman Air Route be decided upon I suggest the following monthly subsidies to tribal ,• Shaikhs. Rs. Mn nivan (and Ma'adhid) for rent oi 100 Shaikh salim bin Jiyan vau landing/4 f**. R6 land. rig ground at Mahadhah and protection throughout Eani Ka'ab territory. 30 Shaikh Ahmad bin Abdullah for rent of landing ground at Auhi. 30 Shaikh Salim bin Abdullah for protection in southern half of Wadi Jizzi. 30 Shaikh Hamdan bin Khalfan for protection in northern half of V/adi Jizzi. Between Mahadhah and Abu Jhabi it may be advisable to subsidise - in conjunction with Abu Dhabi - one of the Bani Yas Baduin sections 30 Rs. per mensem for protection in case of forced landings in that area. Over and above this an occasional douceur of Hs.60/ to the Awamir and other Baduin who wander into this area would appear to be advisabxe. The total cost of this would be about is .3 ,0^0/- i per annum. PHSann ■ : ill ___' ■ ***} Confidential * D.O.N o .IOOO-S of 1934. The Residency, Bushire 9 the 1st November x934. Die Please refer to my Note of 21st September i .934 suggesting, in connection with the Blue Line, that Tribal Boundaries, instead of fixed frontiers on Western standards, might be adopted between whatever territories iiiast of the Blue Line we concede to Ibn Saud and those of our clients - the Persian Gulf Shaikhs. * rs U J x * 2 # In paragraph 6 of that Note 1 said that quite possibly Ibn Saud himself might welcome the idea of Tribal Boundaries. I was therefore much interested to learn from Dickson, (when 1 stopped at Kuwait for a ^evv days on my way out) &gt; that at the OJair Comerence in 1922, when Cox met Ibn Saud for the purpose of settling the Nejd-'Iraq frontier, at which Dickson also was present^ Ibn Saud fought very hard for a tribal boundary between the two States. It was not found possible to arrange this, but conditions as between the territories of the small Trucial Coast Shaikhs and Saudi -Arabia are very different to those existing between Saudi -araoia and 'Iraq, and the fact that Ihn Saud was then in favour of a tribal boundary argues that he would welcome the idea now, provided that after further investigation we can put this proposal forward to him as suiting us- 3. Dickson is of course an expert on Arab tribal affairs and I enclose three extracts mm an interesting report / J -G.Laithwaite Esquire, The India Office, London.t--** report which I asked him to Eiake for me. Extract A shows Ibn Saud^ general ideas in ±922 on the subject of tribal boundaries, and presumably they would be much the same now. Extract B mentions briefly a small and successful experiment in tribal boundaries which Dickson himself carried out in 'Iraqi and which is a good augury for its trial else where . Extract C gives Dickson's ideas as to the fixing of tribal boundaries between Ibn Saud and the Trucial Coast territories.

Dickson, lolitical Agent, Kuwait, on Ibn baud 's attitude at the 'Oqair' meeting with Sir Percy Cox in November 1922 with special regard to the question of what he considered the best form of boundary between 'Iraq and Nejd. At th« Oqair Conl'erence in question which was attended by Ibn Saud, 3ir Percy Cox, the minister of Public uoi'ks (for 1 Iraq^ and Abdul batij. - ashfi ax ...enc.il 01 basra (un -official Adviser to Ibn Saud), I distinctly recollect that Ibn Saud started off by insisting tnat the ,.riaiir, an 'Iraq tribe of Bedouin, was his and that it was necest&gt;;.ry for his boundary to extend right up to the Euphrates not because he wished to control that river, out uectuse the Dhafir as well as his big bedouin tribes actually moved up annually to the Euphrates and would never be denied right of access, which was a question of lire and death for the desertman. When it was pointed out by Sir Percy Cox that this claim was a ridiculous one and could not be ais- cussed, Ibn Saud gave in over the Dhafir tribe and adopted the more 'reasonable line that to safeguard the rights 01 hi. own tribes and prevent future trouble there should be a tribal boundary described as above and by the system of wells and grazing grounds owned by each tribe. This, he said, would be easy as everyone was aware of these, and each tribe from the days of Abraham knew exactly which were its wells and grazing grounds and which were not. Xhat is to say he advocated for instance that the southern- jiaze. Dhafir and Kuwait tribes most wells claimed by the Mia , . a TTnaii which he claimed) (excluding Mutair, Awazim and Ajman v While any wells Known to be should form the boundary, whixe ——— common /i ■ J.A uj J -2- coxnaon property (such existed 'between Aiiase and Dhafir, and between Dhafir and Lutair tribes) were to 'be declared neutral. When asked how the claims to these wells were to be proved Itan Saud retorted that the Desert world knew them as clearly as the light of day, and moreover tribal ,, Wosems n or marks, existed on the inner walls of almost all of them, and in the unlikely event of a dispute arising in the matter the 'Ahl el Khibra' or wise men with knowledge, could put the matter right. In any case Ibn Saud maint ined the right of Nejd tribes to go up to the Euphrates to make their annual purchases. 4t«t(4e # B 1 myself had bitter experience as .Political Officer, Muntafik, of the futility of the old IWkish arbitrary boundaries between LI*vS and only found relie. from inter-Liwa tribal fighting when at my suggestion Sir PerCj Cox concurred in mi' introducing tribal boundaries• ♦ I iExtract from Note by Lieutenant Colonel H.E.P.Dickson, 1 olitical Agent, Kuwait, on Ibn Saud^ attitude at the M Oqair M meeting with Sir Percy Cox in November 1922 with special regard to the question of what he considered the best form of boundary between 'Iraq and Nejd. A8 regards the question of fixing some sort of a boundary between Ibn Saud and the Trucial Coast tribes, resulting from the new Blue Line policy: If I may say so, I consider the only sensible way to settle such problem would be to have a tribal boundary# As a preliainary, the Murra tribe must be acknowledged to be Ibn oauo's, and he must be asked what other tribes he claims in the hinterland. The Trucial Coast tribes, I believe, are those making u y Bani Yas and Jowassim confederations. They include tne various trucial coast towns and hamlets right up to ^atar. ibn Baud must be told in any agreement come to, something in tne following lines: ( u ) He must respect the tribal wells and grazing zones in the interior used from time immemorial by the Trucial Coast tribes and their Shaikhs. (b) Both hie and the Trucial Coast tribes may pass into each other's territories in search of grazing when necessary, without let or hindrance. (c) Saudi tribes should at all times have the right to 'Musabilah' to the coast towns (i.e.buy their provisions there), and neither he nor the Trucial Coast Chiefs must prevent such operations unless carried out in a non -friendly and non -peaceful manner. -p Pither Saudi Arabia or of the Trucial (d) The tribes oi eitner oauux Coast /w 5V -2- Coast if grazing in each other's country to be liable to pay Zikat to either Ibn Saud or the Trucial Coast Shaikhs as the case may be# Some clauses should also be inserted to ensure that Ibn Saud did not order his big tribes to settle permanently in Trucial Coast territory, simply by way of bullying, though if left to themselves they will of course give no trouble. It is an axiom that Nejd tribes will never voluntarily want to hurt coastal towns or their tribes anywhere in Arabia, as they draw supplies from them, and do not want their Musabil a stopped. Any trouble will always be caused by the hinterland ruler who can bring pressure, in this case Ibn Saud.CONFIDENTIAL. 'No. 1001-S of 1934.

Record of First Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza {Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs), held at the Foreign Office on September 19, 1934. FUAD BEY HAMZA called on Mr. Rendel this morning accompanied by the Saudi Arabian Minister in London, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. Sir A. Ryan was also present, except at the beginning of the conversation. 2. Mr. Rendel drew Fuad Bey out on the subjects he wished to discuss, and elicited the fact that he regarded the question of the south-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia as being of special importance. 3. Fuad. Bey dealt first, however, with the question of the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He wished to know how His Majesty's Government would view a tightening up of those relations in the common interest of two Arab countries, both of which were on specially friendly terms with His Majesty's Government. His Government had not made any definite approach to the Iraqi Government, but they had the possibility in view, always provided that His Majesty's Government saw no objection. They did not wish to do anything contrary to His Majesty's Government's policy. 4. Mr. Rendel said that he would like to have a clearer view of what Fuad Bey had in mind. Speaking generally, and subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, he said that His Majesty's Government would welcome any thing tending to promote concord and prosperity between the Arab States, and would therefore view with sympathy any rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq which had for its object the promotion of peace in Arabia. It would be necessary to consider carefully the nature of any proposed understanding, to ensure that it was consonant with the existing obligations of the parties, notably those of Iraq under her Treaty of Alliance with us and as a member of the League of Nations. He did not think, however, that such obligations would be a barrier to a closer understanding between baudi Arabia and I raq, and consideied that any points which might arise could be covered by suitable drafting. ( ) 5 Sir A. Ryan concurred, adding, however, that he thought King Abdui Aziz had rather more in view and sought some sort of a British guarantee of the proposed Saudi—Iraq understanding. 6. Fuad Bey said that this was a misconception. The King did not seek a guarantee, but wished merely to ascertain the attitude of His Majesty s ^ ov e ln - ment He went on to ask what kind of understanding would be suitable whethei, for instance, His Majesty's Government would be a party to it or whether their position would be merely that of a third Power, which would be kept informed at intervals of what was passing and would take a sympathetic mteiest. 7. Mr. Rendel explained, on the one hand, the objections of His ^jesty s Government to assuming any new obligations, aad, on the other the undesn ab y of the indefinite multiplication of instruments tmmg no j repeated, again reminding Fuad Bey that he was sp a ing ] , , of the Secretary of State, that His Majesty's Government would view with sympathy a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and object to wiiat^ had said about the need for harmonising it with while thev would be glad to receive such information as the parties directly concerned'might give them, they would prefer not to be themselves par ics o understanding arrived at. O This question has already been fully considered by the Foreign Office legal advisers in connexion with an earlier proposal for a Ferso-lraqi nou-aggression pac [206 t—1] : B2 8. Sir A. Ryan observed that it was all the more important to have a clear view, as express reference had been made in all the earlier discussions to two other Powers, non-Arab, with whom His Majesty's Government were also on terms of friendship, and who were neighbours of Iraq though not of Saudi Arabia. 9. Fuad Bey said that he had nothing to conceal. The two Powers just mentioned were Turkey and Persia. His Government were at present on quite friendly terms with both, and there was no aggressive motive behind their wish for closer relations with Iraq. Nevertheless, the recent rapprochement between Turkey and Persia had inspired anxiety in all Arab countries. It was all the greater as a secular racial animosity existed between Arabs and both Turks and Persians. However correct relations might now be, his Government feared the ulterior designs of Turkey and Persia, about which they had a good deal of information. 10. Turkey favoured the maintenance of the French position in Syria, subject to her wish for a readjustment in her favour in the Alexandretta region! Mustafa Kemal Pasha had stated to a reliable informant that Turkey preferred to have two separate Powers on her southern border.( 2 ) There was no secret about Persian aspirations in the Persian Gulf, witness the claims she was asserting to Bahrein, &amp;c. Persia was growing more powerful, e.g., she now had six warships in the Gulf, where previously there had been none but British ships. Speaking as an Arab, Fuad Bey would like to see Bahrein develop into an independent Arab unit; in the meanwhile, he certainly did not wish to see Persia establish a claim, as against His Majesty's Government. 11. Mr. Rendel said he did not think Persian claims to Bahrein need worry Fuad Bey, but that he understood the general anxiety of which he had spoken. At the same time such information as His Majesty's Government possessed did not suggest that there was much danger in the rapprochement between Turkey and Persia, or that either Power had aggressive designs. Turkey had pursued a remarkably peaceful and non-aggressive policy for the last ten years. 12. Fuad Bey was impressed by the quick changes that came over the relations of btates. In Europe he found a very different grouping from that of two years ago. He cited as one example the present closeness of the relations between France, Russia and Turkey. It had looked some months ago as though there weie e\en more material for war than in 1914. Happily this danger had been a\erted, but there might again be quick changes; and similarly in the East, whatever the present position, Turkey and Persia might become hostile to the Arabs. Any blow aimed by them at Iraq would, as the King had told Sir A Evan menace Saudi Arabia indirectly. '' 17 ' 1 3 This digression was not further pursued. Fuad Bey said he under- s ood what Mr. Rendel had said regarding His Majesty's Government's attitude m regard to the proposed rapprochement between Saudi and Iraq He went on ArabStat^ 1 ^ WOUld ^ 0f Similar ra PP rochements wit h other 14 Mr. Rendel emphasised the importance which His Majesty's Govern ment attach to a settlement between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. As Wards the smaller states on the Persian Gulf, however, he said that it would be of great importance to know clearly what sort of arrangements Fuad Bey had in mind. Was not the situation already sufficiently provided for under article 6 of the t reaty ot Jedda.

THE meeting was attended by— Mr. Rendel. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs).. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). Sir Andrew Ryan (His Maiesty's Minister at Jedda). Mr. Johnstone. Mr. Rendel recalled that, at Fuad Bey's request, it had been agreed on the previous day to begin the present discussion by examining the problem of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. As the Saudi Government were aware, His Majesty's Government were satisfied as to the continued legal validity of the position established by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914. They saw nothing to be gained, however, by pursuing the discussion on purely legal lines if there were any other means of reaching a satisfactory settlement; they realised that King Ibn Saud felt strongly on the subject; and they considered that a friendly adjustment of the matter should be possible. They were anxious for a friendly settlement of all outstanding questions with King Ibn Saud, but. in the first place, they would like to know more about King Ibn Saud's own views on the frontier problem. His Majesty's Government had certain important responsibilities east of the ' blue line,' which King Ibn Saud had recognised. It was desirable to establish some agreed boundary in the region in question; but, before going any further, it was necessary to have some idea of King Ibn Saud's desiderata. Fuad Bey expressed his satisfaction at hearing that His Majesty's Govern ment did not intend to take their stand rigidly on what they considered their legal rights. King Ibn Saud, he said, was not aiming at expansion, nor did he desire to hold anything which he had not held before. The appeal of His Majesty's Government to the two Anglo-Turkish Conventions had, however, come as a great shock to him. Those conventions had not been referred to on past occasions, either at the time of the conclusion of the treaty of 1915, under which the question of King Ibn Saud's eastern frontiers was left open to further discussion, or at the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of Jedda in 1927, when King Ibn Saud had enquired about the relations of His Majesty's Government with the Arab chiefs of the Persian Gulf, and had been furnished with copies &lt;?f a number of agreements, but not of these. Meanwhile, Fuad Bey was awaiting details regarding the boundary line which King Ibn Saud wished to propose, and he expected to receive these by Monday, the 24th September. Speaking generally, he considered that King Ibn Saud would claim that those tribes who had long been considered his subjects should continue under his rule, and that their territories should be included in his dominions; he cited particularly the Mui ra and Manasir tribes. To the south, he suggested that the Qara Mountains beyond the Ruba-al-Khali might be a suitable boundary. Mr. Rendel pointed out to him that the latter claim was a very far-reaching one, as the Qara Mountains were close to the south coast of Arabia. It was clear from Mr Bertram Thomas's journeys and maps that there was an extensive aiea between these mountains and the Ruba-al-Khali, which appeal eci always to ha\e been part of the territory of Muscat. Fuad Bey then mentioned another line of hills further north, and implied that Ibn Saud did not wish to claim any territory to the south beyond the Ruba-al- Khali; but the point was not pursued. [206 u—1] B Q m 11 i I2 |r. si in a Mr. Rendel repeated that, if His Majesty's Government should find it possible to reach a satisfactory friendly agreement, they would not insist on the legal aspect of the matter; but, in saying this, what they had in mind was something more than an agreement on this one question; they desired, in fact a general agreement which should cover a number of questions outstanding between the two Governments, for instance, the Koweit blockade. In regard to some of these questions. His Majesty's Government would have certain desiderata; King Ibn Saud would no doubt have his own desiderata in other directions. If the frontier question could be satisfactorily settled as part of such a general agree ment, the legal position of His Majesty's Government could be left on one side His Majesty's Government must, however, reserve their right to return to their legal claims if for any reason a general settlement were not found possible. The ; legal position, even if left in abeyance, remained unchanged, and His Majesty's Government were still prepared, if necessary, to uphold the legal validity of the ' blue line.' ' ' l^t. Sir A. Ryan concurred in this view. He added that, in pressing for a general ^ ^ settlement. His Majesty's Government were following the lead given by King fcred to mi Ibn Saud himself, when he had suggested conversations with a view to clearin? I a long view up his whole position vis-a-vis of His Majesty's Government. not a i Mr. Rendel suggested that the further examination of the frontier problem SilTlie might be allowed to wait until Fuad Bey received the instructions which he was juuesi shortly expecting. Meanwhile, he felt bound to make it clear that there was it S( in fact, a good reason why copies of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and fLJthi 1914 had not been given to Ibn Saud after the Treaty of Jedda. King Ibn Saud '^eir ea had at that time merely asked for copies of the agreements between His Maiestv's IV Government and other Arab rulers. There had, therefore, been no question^ i flith supplying him with copies of agreements between His Majesty's Government and the Ottoman Government. In any case, the ' 4 blue line ' was generally known 1 M Bex and appeared on several published maps. mdfs Gov* Fuad Bey expressed himself as hopeful of reaching a settlement of out- standing questions. He added, however, that, although King Ibn Saud might .fi: ril be willing to settle any present differences between himself and His Maiestv's f Government, he was anxious that there should not be any suspicion of what f ( 1D Fuad Bey termed ' marchandage.' As regards the frontier problem. His ^ ' Majesty s Government s reservation of their legal rights might perhaps raise '• difficulties. Would it not be better to leave the legal aspect out altogether, MBey confine the discussion to the actual facts of the present position, and treat each how subja question separately on its individual merits, as His Majesty's Government had iWreea always insisted on doing m the past ? ' , ^ ° e Mr Rendel pointed out that in any general settlement, while problems were Jf rep ! ac naturally considered on their merits, they also had to be considered as inter- connected parts of a whole. So long as there was hope of a satisfactory general i :: settlement it would be possible to leave the question of strict legal 'rilhts in . to V abeyance, but it must always be understood that, if finally a general settlement ^ f 1 proved unattainable, a return could be made to the separate examination of each 7®' 0 f 0 particular case on its own merits. There was no question of what Fuad Bey had ( , ne 8 0tl ati called marchandage. The position was simply that the merits of any 1 J® 1 ?.'® particular question would have to be considered in the light of the overriding merits ot the settlement as a whole. It was a case of give and take and of taking the long rather than the short view ..f Andre . r : - Fuad H&lt; Sir Andrew Ryan emphasised his earlier remark that His Maiestv's Govern- fWedd ment were following King Ibn Saud's lead. It was in accordance with King ^Fuadl n baud s own wishes that His Majesty's Government were in this case departing ^arranm rom leu more u^ual piactice of considering each question in isolation, and were ' the agreeing to consider the various outstanding questions together. Thev realised ijlf that if an attempt were made to deal with the frontier difficulty by itself, the King s strong feelings would make a settlement on a strictly legal basis difficult and contentious, he gave as an instance the known reluctance of King Ibn Saud . o ^ to admit that he could be held to be bound by transactions with'the former JV^b* Turkish Government. : %1. I n ^ «a]3 1 1 2 Mr. Rendel again urged that it would be much easier to merge the frontier rf ' a .,8 en A era . sett l ement -informed Fuad Bey that it was contem plated that bir Andrew Ryan should embark on general negotiations on his nego r tiati 0 ons e now: P * WaS p0SSlble t0 agree in P rinci P le to suoh Fund 'Bey finally expressed willingness in principle to deal with the various standing problems on general lines, but explained that Kins: Ibn Saud who had made so many sacrifices in the past for the sake of good relations with His Majesty s Government, could not be expected to make many further concessions now. Sir Andrew Ryan demurred to Fuad Bey's suggestion that Ibn Saud had done nothing but make sacrifices to His Majesty's Government. He had indeed accommodated his policy to theirs, but he had derived much benefit from their support. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the only sacrifices which both sides would be required to make in the projected general settlement would be such as might, on a long view, be expected to bring them compensating advantages in the end. It was not a case of altruism on either side. But in any general settlement between two Governments both sides usually had to give way over certain points. Meanwhile, he would be grateful if Fuad Bey could, on his part, outline the principal questions which King Ibn Saud might like to see included in a general settlement. So far as His Majesty's Government were concerned, he had already mentioned their chief preoccupation, namely, the question of the Koweit blockade. It was their earnest wish to see relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit put on a really satisfactory basis, as had been done successively in the case of Saudi relations with Iraq and later with Transjordan. Fuad Bey stated that King Ibn Saud fully realised the desire of His Majesty's Government for a settlement of the blockade question, which had indeed ( ^ formed the subject of intermittent discussion between the two Governments for y the past four years. His Majesty's Government should, however, understand that King Ibn Saud's measures against Koweit were taken not from hostility but purely in order to safeguard his interests. King Ibn Saud had made his position clear and it was for His Majesty's Government to propose the lines of a settlement. Fuad Bey then raised the question of the future of the Treaty of Jedda, which was now subject to denunciation on short notice by either side—a position which Ibn Saud regarded as unsatisfactory. After some discussion it was agreed that there were three possible alternatives, namely, to denounce the treaty without replacing it by any new instrument, to give it a greater degree of permanence by a supplementary agreement, or to negotiate an entirely new treaty which could if necessary replace it. The first of these alternatives was mutually agreed to be undesirable. The choice between the other two would depend on the nature of the general settlement. It was possible that, if the new general settlement of outstanding questions between the two Governments grew in scope as the negotiations proceeded, it might eventually be found desirable to conclude an entirely new Anglo-Saudi treaty. In the meanwhile, no decision need be taken on this point Sir Andrew Ryan alluded to previous conversations with Fuad Hamza, in which Fuad Hamza had mentioned the following points in regard to which the Treaty of Jedda seemed to need amendment; slavery, the Akaba—Maan question (though Fuad Hamza had then said that the King did not wish to go back on the present arrangements) and the present form of article 6 of the T reaty of Jedda recardin 0 * the relations between Ibn Saud and the Arab rulers of the Persian ^ o o Gulf. Fuad Bey said that he wished to add a fourth point, namely, that of the prevailing language of the treaty text. As His Majesty s Goveinment wert aware, it had been stipulated in the Treaty of Jedda that the English text should prevail. In the recent Anglo-Yemeni Treaty, on the other nand, the Arabic text had been allowed to prevail. [206 u—1] B 2Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that the first two points which had been mentioned, i.e., the question of slavery and that of the Akaba-Maan frontier were not, in fact, dealt with in the text of the Treaty of Jedda, but in exchanges of notes signed at the time of the conclusion of the treaty, but, in fact, quite independent of it. These two questions, whatever might be decided about them need not therefore affect the future of the treaty. As regards the question of the relations between Ibn Saud and the Arab rulers of the Gulf, which was dealt with in a general way, in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, he considered that any more elaborate arrangements, which it might be necessary or desirable to make to govern future relations between Ibn Saud and the rulers of South-Eastern Arabia, would normally fall to be discussed in connexion with any arrangements that might be made regarding the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. He thought he ought perhaps to mention at this point that the Sultan of Muscat was more completely independent than the Trucial sheikhs, and that it might therefore be necessary for him to be brought in as a separate party to any eventual settlement. He repeated, however, that the whole of this question seemed to him to fall to be dealt with together with that of the frontier. As regards the question of the prevailing language of any new agreement, he said that this seemed to him to be a point of form which should not be allowed to interfere with the political issues involved. In point of fact, the departure from precedent which had been agreed to in the case of the recent treaty with the Yemen was due to the unique circumstance that the Yemen was so out of touch with civilisation elsewhere that no one could be found in that country with any adequate knowledge of any European language. Unique conditions required unique treatment. Saudi Arabia was in a very different position. The point, however, involved rather complicated questions of precedent, &amp;c., and had better be dealt with quite independently of the political issues. Mr. Rendel then proceeded to deal with the question of slavery. He explained that this question was one of great importance, on which public sentiment in this country was extremely strong. England had played a very remarkable part in the abolition of the institution of slavery, and public opinion here would never tolerate any step which might be regarded as a step in the wrono' direction It any new arrangements were to be made on this point, therefore,'it must be quite clear that their effect would be to hasten and not to retard the inevitable and ultimate abolition of slavery as an institution. He felt sure that Fuad Bey and indeed King Ibn Saud himself, were sufficiently enlightened to realise that slavery an an institution was fundamentally wrong, and was doomed to extinction in any country that hoped to make true progress and to play a worthy part amonc the nations of the world. He could say categoricallv, therefore, that His Majesty s Crovernment would not be able to agree to any new arrangement which did not fit in with these principles. The question was of such importance that tc c ould not m any case do more than hear and take note of any proposals which ad Bey might wish to make. If, however. King Ibn Saud should wish to propose some arrangement the effect of which would be not to retard but to accelerate the abolition or at any rate the reduction of slavery, he felt sure it would be examined with all possible consideration for the King's position in tiie matter. Fuad Bey stated that in his view slavery would sooner or later cease when slaves ceased to be imported. King Ibn Saud could, however, proceed no further than the social and economic state of his kingdom would allow. Further he had to make allowances for the fact that Islamic law permitted slavery. Steps might nevertheless, be taken to limit the number of slaves in such a wav that an annual decline m their number would eventually lead to the total extinction of slavery. He alluded once again to the recent Anglo-Yemeni treaty settlement, under which the Imam had undertaken not to allow the importation of slaves f 6 *!? ^ might be possible for King Ibn Saud to give some under taking of that nature and simultaneously to take steps to alleviate the lot of those slaves who were already in Saudi Arabia. Kinci 1 t L R J nd I l s aid that it would, of course, make a. great difference if King Ibn Saud could take any such steps within his own dominions. pl tl ned « th ^ th f^ T'® 8 reat difficulties attending such action. Apait from King Ibn Saud s difficulties with his own public opinion, it was ft ld 1 be dies, D 1 but 'for an in&lt;j tctt ! useful still- sted, p r0V1 J Dted witt ilioftw 86 ' onr fo ;ested, as | 3 solution woi jf proposed, if concession k and migt JEendel repe itowliat the a Saud would itin advance isubsequer Sir Andrei to abando iDdonment to i wider Britii It W( -ranee of Ibi lite action 1 lof slaves a( wily in Sai slave w was deci y Ham; Majesty's G (1) Th( (2) Tli( (3) Th( (4) Bal &amp;f essential that, if he were to maintain his prestige, his action should not be capable o emg lepresented as dictated by external pressure. He suo-o-ested ^t^riolicy ng Ibn Saud t0 take a PP ro P-^ action as a Matter A-ffi re l 3i3ed 1Ils Majesty's Government fully realised these difficultieb but that they did not seem to him insuperable. A prohibition of the importation of slaves would, of course, be a great step forward. But this would no really affect the question of the institution of slavery, since the existing; s ave population was large enough, he understood, to maintain the supplv of slaves for an indefinite period If, therefore, Ibn Saud could take some steps with a view to the gradual reduction of the number of born slaves, it would be more usetul still borne concession, such as that which Fuad Bey had himself suggested, providing for the emancipation of slaves who were maltreated or discontented with their lot, would be an enormous step forward. Such a measure would, oi course, for the reasons which had just been discussed, have to be taken by Ibn baud on his own initiative. But if it were actually taken, it might make it much easiei foi His Majesty s Government to make some concession in return. He suggested, as a peisonal and unofficial suggestion of his own, that by far the best solution would be for Ibn Saud spontaneously to take some action in the sense proposed, in advance of any concession by His iVIajesty's Government. Any concession which His Majesty's Government might agree to make could then be made subsequently, in specific recognition of the fact that Ibn Saud had taken the measures in question. 1 his might create an excellent impression here, and might justify some modification of the present arrangements. Mr. Rendel repeated, however, that he could give no undertaking at this stage as to what the attitude of His Majesty's Government would be. Fuad Bey thought that something on these lines might be possible, but that Ibn baud would certainly require some guarantee from His Majesty's Govern ment in advance that, if he took the action proposed. His Majesty's Government would subsequently make the desired concession. Sir Andrew Ryan observed that His Majesty's Government were being asked to abandon an existing right. It would be necessary to justify any such abandonment to opinion in this country, which, on this subject, was very strong, to a wider British opinion, including that of many Moslems, and to international opinion. It would not suffice for such justification to rely merely on an assurance of Ibn Saud's good intentions. It would be necessary to know what definite action he contemplated to prevent the slave trade and to mitigate the lot of slaves actually suffering from hardship. Although the lot of slaves generally in Saudi Arabia might be fortunate, there were, in fact, instances of oppressive slavery. He cited as an example the facility with which slave husbands and wives could be separated. It was decided to pursue this matter at a later meeting. Before leaving, Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned four points which he would wish to pursue with His Majesty's Government during the following discussions. These were :— (1) The Hejaz Railway. (2) The cable line between Jedda and Port Sudan. (3) The Koweit Neutral Zone oil concession. (4) Bahrein transit dues. Eastern Department, Foreign Office, September 20, 1934. ■ -&amp;■ vEASTERN ( A rabia ). (^O September 21, 1934. C onfidential. S ection i. [E 5957/2429/25] No. 1. Record of Third Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza held at the Foreiqn Office on September 21, 1934. THE following were present:— Mr. Rendel. Fuad Bey Hamza, Deputy Saudi-Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, Saudi-Arabian Minister in London. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Johnstone. Mr. Rendel suggested that the meeting should consider in order the various points to which Fuad Bey had referred at the end of the previous day's meeting. The first of these was the question of Aqaba and Maan. Mr. Rendel was not altogether clear as to Fuad Bey's object in raising this question. The present position between the two Governments rested on the first exchange of notes signed at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda, which provided for the maintenance of the de facto frontier. He understood that Fuad Bey had recently stated to Sir A. Ryan at Jedda that the Saudi Government were not seeking to disturb this arrangement. Sir A. Ryan added that he understood that the Saudi Government main tained their previous attitude of reserve towards this question, but that they did not consider the present time propitious for reopening it. Fuad Bey explained that for various reasons, both political and religious, his Government were unable to accept the separation of the Aqaba-Maan district from the Hejaz. They would always be ready to discuss this question on this basis, but if His Majesty's Government did not consider the present moment opportune for reopening it, the Saudi Government had on their side no wish to raise it. Failing a further discussion and a new settlement, the Saudi Govern ment were prepared to preserve the existing arrangement. Mr. Rendel said that there would, of course, have been advantages—if there were to be any general clearing up of outstanding questions—in reaching a permanent settlement on this particular point also. It would have been desirable to establish a clear and definitive frontier in this area. But there could be no question of His Majesty's Government modifying their attitude on the main issue of the future of Aqaba and Maan, and if the Saudi Government were not prepared to consider any suggestion for a permanent and definitive settlement on the basis of the present de facto situation, there would certainly be no advantage in reopening the question. On the other hand, there seemed to be some local uncertainty as to the precise definition of the frontier at various points on the frontier between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia. In view of what Fuad Hamza had said regarding the Aqaba- Maan sector of the frontier—i.e., the de facto frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz—there would probably be no object in discussing that sector of the line.. But these considerations need not apply in regard to the 1 ransjordan—Nejd sectoi of the frontier, where there might well be certain advantages in clearing up any local uncertainties. Mr. Rendel could not make any ofiicial suggestions on this point pending consultation with the Transjordan authorities; but, speaking quite personally and unofficially, he thought it might be worth taking the oppoi tumty of the proposed general settlement to try to dispose of any local uncertainties that might exist as to the precise definition of the frontier line. Sir A Ryan gave as instances of the type of question which had created difficulty in this direction, the former dispute with the Saudi Government regarding the position of Haditha, which had since been acknowledged to be m [206 x—1] BSaudi territory, and the present diflerence over Hazim, which the Transjordan 1 authorities considered as indisputably in Transjordan. Mr. Rend el put forward personally and unofficially a tentative suggestion to ^ ? that some of these points might be disposed of by some kind of local technical I frontier commission. He explained, however, that this suggestion was naturally 1 Fuad B subject to the views of the Transjordan authorities, and that it might be found to i '-ii reservati be open to unexpected difficulties. Fuad Bey received this suggestion with partial assent. He agreed that a i ^ clarification of the position in regard to the Trans jordan-Nejd frontier— e.q. by '■'his the appointment of a frontier or delimitation commission—might well be dealt ^'hoth with in the proposed general negotiations. On the other hand, if the question of ^ f . ntV the future of Aqaba and Maan were to be left in abeyance, his Government would ^ ^ have difficulty in touching in any way whatsoever the subject of the frontier 11 W f^ between Transjordan and the Hejaz. | -eoutstaw Mr. Rendel agreed that King Tbn Saud was free to maintain the position which he had taken up in 1927 on this subject, and thought that His Maiesty's Government would, in these circumstances, probably be content to continue on the present basis, and not to press for any more formal recognition of the existing reieJ frontier. It would, however, be necessary to consult the various departments of His Majesty s Government concerned and the local authorities before saying any ^ t thing more definite. Meanwhile, two points appeared to have emerged from the ! ,Jcle6of present discussion: (1) King Ibn Saud was not yet prepared to crystallise the ^FP 086 0 * present de facto frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz; (2) there might be i certain advantages in including in the proposed negotiations for a general settle ment some arrangement for the clarification of any points connected with the 1 ransjordan-Nejd frontier, regarding which there was any local uncertainty^ 1 ) i rpi . * . 1*1 . fLimication ne next subject which came up for discussion was the Hejaz Railway. 13Radio Orii , ■ ® e y enquired the views of His Majesty's Government on the proposal ! il1 which he had made to Sir A.

The next subject on luad Bey's list was the question of telegraphic and wireless communication between Saudi Arabia and the outer world with particular reference to the provisions of the Jedda-Port Sudan Cable Agreement. Fuad B e y recalled the fact that the Saudi Government were debarred by article 6 ot this agreement from using their wireless stations in the Heiaz for the purpose of communication with other countries. When the agreement had been ^gned there were two separate Governments, in the Hejaz and in Neid, and the agreement had been interpreted as applying to the Heiaz only. The situation had now greatly changed in every respect; and the Saudi Government were hndmg it exceedingly inconvenient to be obliged to send all telegraphic eommunications from the Hejaz by the Port Sudan cable. A French company, the Kadio Orient, and various Italian interests had also approached the Saudi (jovernment m the matter. Sir A. Ryan recalled that the working agreement had been entered into by the Sudan and Hejaz Governments jointly as joint owners, and by the Eastern Telegraph Company as workers, of the cable. The agreement was terminable on two years' notice, to be given either by both joint owners or by the company. Fuad Bey said that an exchange of notes had taken place between the Sudan and Saudi Governments arranging that if the Saudi Government should approach the Sudan Government with a view to the termination of the agreement, the Sudan Government would agree to join in giving the required notice. Sir A. Ryan st&amp;ted that the interpretation of the agreement had in the past given rise to various legal difficulties which had not, however, been pursued, as the amalgamation of the Eastern Telegraph Company with Marconis seemed to have simplified the problem. On the Persian Gulf side, however, a somewhat similar problem had arisen over the question of communications between Hasa and Bahrein. Conversations had taken place between King Ibn Saud, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sir H. Biscoe in 1932. No advance had been made, and the matter had lain dormant for some time, but had lately been revived, and His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jedda had been instructed to revert to it with the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey Hamza also raised the question of the charges on the cable. It was agreed, however, that the question of the interpretation of the Jedda-Port Sudan Cable Agreement and of Saudi wireless communications with other countries was a very technical one and one in which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom were not very directly interested, and that it would be preferable, therefore, that this question should not be dealt with in the proposed general settlement. It was agreed that the best course would be for a meeting to be arranged before Euad Bey's departure from London between himself and representatives of Cables and Wireless (Limited) (now incorporating inter alia both the Eastern Telegraph Company and Marconis) and, if possible, some representative of the Sudan Government, possibly Sir Stewart Symes, who was understood to be in England on leave. [206 x— 1] b 2 •assio® 8 ' llieprop' 5., j fyy He 511V*** * ability ot The next subject discussed was the Koweit Neutral Zone Oil Concession. Fuad Bey recapitulated the position of the Saudi Government vis-a-vis the Standard Oil Company of California in regard to the option which had been given them in connexion with this concession. After a short discussion, however it was agreed to postpone further examination of this matter until the following week, when an India Office expert on this question would be available to join in the discussion. 16. Finally, the question of the Bahrein Transit Dues was raised. Fuad Bey explained that there were two difficulties confronting his Government in this matter : firstly, the question of the transit dues themselves; and, secondly, ^ the question of direct shipments to the Hasa coast. As regards the first of these,' the Saudi Government feared that the Bahrein Government were about to raise the dues, if they had not already done so. They considered, moreover, that any consignments addressed either to King Ibn Saud or to the Saudi Government should be exempted from dues. Sir Andre 17. Sir Andrew Ryan stated that for some time past the negotiations on n to give this subject had been transferred to London, and that, although he had been L §au( kept informed, he had not been directly concerned in this matter, until during deemed n his recent audience with King Ibn Saud at Taif the King had raised with him oseoftribf the question of direct shipments. He pointed out that it was scarcely fair of the Saudi Government both to demand that the Bahrein Government should ^ reduce the rates of the dues and at the same time endeavour to kill the Bahrein emphasised transit trade. Bahrein must live. ! it local int ^ofecow piD^ e( lid not be jfr. Eendt d practi' jemment. 18. Mr. Rendel stated that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had already represented , iuiiy at the Foreign Office the views of his Government on this subject. His 1 Majesty's Government, for their part, had suggested that a Saudi delegation C rl i'yn 1/1 O ot1 4' r\ 'D o V» t -* 4- -I ^ 'L a 1 * 1 i . t rv t • should be sent to Bahrein, to examine whether the issue between the Saudi and Sir A. Ryi extent c fc and reli Mst the pol lircraft ove: Bahrein Governments could not be narrowed down if not removed altogether, ithe King He suggested that this was, in fact, the most practical means of settling this m Mm into question that the Saudi Government could not prejudice their case by sendino- iisMajesty's such a delegation, and that if the discussions should fail they would still be free ^sa coast to pursue the matter with His Majesty's Government direct. The question particularly as regards the dues, was a complicated and technical one, where local data would be necessary, and which could be dealt with far more effectivelv on 11 T • l ' ( the spot than in London or in Jedda. He felt sure that such a local meeting f would do much to clear the air, even if it did not lead to a final settlement, and ^ 01 he suggested that preliminary discussions of this nature might well take place at once. Sir A. Ryan would not be back in Jedda until December, so there was plenty of time to explore the ground locally meanwhile. If the proposed local c iscussions should lead to nothing, and the Saudi Government should have reasonable grounds for considering the attitude of the Bahrein Government to 5 A once be unreasonable, it would still be possible to bring the matter into the scope of the general discussions with Sir A. Ryan after his return to Jedda. , | ere(1 witi t &gt; Sir A ndrew Ryan stated that he had always considered Saudi Arabia and t Ibn Sand to f be .J ointl y interested m matter, subject to a proviso that with the The questi passage of time this common interest might weaken or vanish. He had tral settlem, throughout been convinced and was still convinced, that the best method of ~ellton nrrno^H a ^ T W0U be whlch His Majesty's Government had ^torai^it proposed, namely, a discussion at Bahrein on a purely practical basis, with the f^rd fl of J ^v fit7l3 a S n a ^ ree ^ ent whlch sho ^ d be concluded for a limited period |%al se i^ MahompH at 1 T S '1 UC \ a conducted by such local experts as, say, Mahomed at Tawil on the Saudi side, and the Financial Adviser with the J lr ^drei oDinio^offpr ^ Sh 1 olltlcal A g en t. on the Bahreini side, would, in his .'Sm sub at T a Tf hut k ZI a se ttlement.

The question, which had often been discussed before, was, in one sense, one of diminishing importance, since the actual extent of the Saudi coastline on the Persian Gulf was small and the radius and reliability of aircraft were steadily increasing. It was, of course, against the policy of His Majesty's Government to make the regular passage oi anciaft over any particular country subject to financial payments. It was clear that, once such a principle were established, there would be no end to it, and that freedom of air communications all over the world would be greatly interfered with. But there would be certain advantages if some agreement could be come to with a view to facilitating the passage of aircraft over King Ibn Sand's territory. The question of dealing with the matter in connexion with the proposed genei al settlement had not yet been fully considered, but Mr. Rendel thought it well to make it clear at once that His Majesty's Government might eventually wish to raise it, lest, if it were left over and only mentioned later, they should be regarded as endeavouring at the last moment to include new subjects in the general settlement and thereby altering its scope. Sir Andrevj Ryan observed that His Majesty's Government might wish to add certain subjects to the list of those to be reviewed during Fuad Bey's visit to London. He mentioned in particular the question of the Government of India's dispensary in the Hejaz. It was agreed that Sir A. Ryan should pursue this question, and possibly certain other minor matters, with Fuad Bey and the Saudi Minister on the morning of the 24th September. It was agreed that the next general conversation should take place on the afternoon of the 24th September, after Fuad Bey had seen the Secretary of State.

[E 5996/2429/25] Fourth Meeting with FuadBey Ham September 24, 1934. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. FUAD BE1 accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, came to see me this moi nmg m accoi dance with the arrangement made at the third conversation, that we should discuss separately the question of the Government of India's dispensaries in the Hejaz and possibly other minor questions. 2. I explained to Fuad Bey that the question of the dispensaries, though important, was non-political and concerned the Indian authorities. Mr. Kendel had therefore asked me to go into the matter with himself and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. I reminded Fuad Bey that when he and I last discussed the question in Jedda we had seemed to be approaching a solution, but the discussion had been interrupted by his illness. 1 he matter had now taken a new and less favourable turn, as the Saudi Government had addressed a circular to Mr Calvert, in which they had asked for separate statements of medical supplies imported for the use of members of the Legation and those imported for general dispensary use, in order that customs duty should be levied on the latter. I read to him the main portions of the telegraphic correspondence, and said that there appeared to be two miscon ceptions, viz., {a) the Saudi Government seemed to think that medical supplies not intended for the use of- the Legation staff were sold to the public, whereas, in fact, the quantities of medicine supplied in return for payment were negligible; and {b) they seemed to think that Fuad Bey and I had dealt only with the status of the Indian medical officers, whereas we had, in fact, dealt with the whole question of the dispensaries. 3. I urged that the Saudi Government should not try to force the issue by assuming that stores, other than those for the use of the members of the Legation, were liable to duty. The Jedda dispensary had existed for some fifty years, and had always enjoyed immunity as part of the British mission. Moreover, the Turkish Government had exempted from duty supplies imported by foreign charitable institutions as such, not only those for diplomatic use. The branch dispensary at Mecca had been opened with Ibn Saud's approval in 1925. There was, I admitted, no written record of this, as the arrangement had been made between the King and the Indian vice-consul, but the best indication of the King's attitude at that time was that for the first year he had provided a house free of rent for the dispensary at Mecca. I was prepared, I said, to pursue the question on the lines foreshadowed in my discussion with Fuad Bey at Jedda, but I could not admit, pending a settlement, that supplies for the dispensaries were liable to customs duty, and I deprecated the attempt of the Saudi Government to enforce their own view in this respect before the whole matter had been thrashed out. The case was a unique one, and while not claiming that the exemption could be claimed under general international usage, there were strong reasons for maintaining it. 4. Fuad Bey suggested that no reliance could be placed on earlier precedent, as the Treaty of Jedda had swept away all such precedents. I replied that the Treaty of Jedda had not done this, but had said that our relations were to be based on principles of international law. International law took great account of established custom. I was quite prepared to seek a solution of the whole question, but I suggested that customs immunity should be granted for the supplies for next pilgrimage season, in order that the present situation should be preserved intact, until we could work out the solution. 5. Fuad Bey said that he had had nothing on the subject from his Govern ment, and was not in a position to discuss it. I said that I was making a definite proposal, i.e., that the stores for next pilgrimage season should be exempted from '206 aa—4] ty/s 5^ September 24, 1934. Section 4. No. 1.duty and the general discussion pursued at leisure. This could, if necessary, be pursued with Mr. Calvert, but I should prefer to leave it until Fuad Bey and I could deal with the matter on our reurn to Jedda. Fuad Bey noted my proposal. 6. I used various arguments, which need not be recorded in detail, to impress on Fuad Bey the importance of this question, urging inter alia that the Saudi Government should take account of the great services rendered by the dispensaries. They supplied wants which the Saudi Government were not as yet in a position to satisfy, and the Saudi Government should not make their position impossible by attempting to exercise excessive control or by adding customs duty to the expenditure entailed, the amount of which was already worrying the Government of India. 7. I told Fuad Bey that this was the most important of the small number of questions which I had suggested adding to the list of those already discussed with Mr. Rendel and myself. I need only advert to two others, viz., the pecuniary claims of His Majesty's Government against the Saudi Government, and the position as regards British nationality in Saudi Arabia. The latter question seemed to be progressing on satisfactory lines and I would not pursue it. I did not wish at this moment to pursue definitely the question of the two debts of the Saudi Government to His Majesty's Government, but I reminded Fuad Bey that we were very anxious to dispose of the matter, which was one on which we were faced with strong insistence on the part of the Treasury. I recalled our proposal that the trivial MacDonnell debt should be settled out of hand, and the liquidation of the larger debt placed on a business basis. I added that I had induced His Majesty's Government to postpone the matter pending a clearing up of the situation between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. That situation had now been liquidated, and I had again reminded Sheikh Yussuf Yasin of the debts shortly before leaving Jedda. 8. Fuad Bey threw out a personal suggestion that perhaps His Majesty's Government might now see their way to promote the flotation of a small loan in this country, sufficient to enable the floating debt of his Government to be paid off. He outlined in very general terms a scheme for the issue of bonds. I received this suggestion very guardedly, but promised to report it. I explained that the matter was outside my sphere and that I could not judge of the possibilities, though I had no reason to think that the prospect of raising money for Saudi Arabia would be any better now than it had been in 1932. 9. In conclusion, I told Fuad Bey, with reference to what had passed at the third meeting about the Jedda-Port Sudan cable, that there was no hope of bringing any adequately equipped representative of the Sudan Government into a discussion of the matter before he left London. I had, however, just seen a representative of Cable and Wireless (Limited), and had suggested that he should meet Fuad Bey. This gentleman had agreed, subject to the reservation that any proposals which might emerge would have to be submitted to the board of the company. The question of Saudi telegraphic communications had arisen in three aspects, viz., cable rates, the position in regard to the present working agreement between the joint owners of the cable {i.e., the Government of the Sudan and the Hejaz) and the Eastern Telegraph Company, and the wish of the Saudi Govern ment to establish wireless communication between Hasa and the outer world. I thought that an entirely non-committal discussion would serve to put those concerned in possession of each other's views and desiderata. 10. Fuad Bey agreed to meet a representative of Cable and Wireless (Limited), and it was arranged that they should meet to-morrow morning at the Foreign Office, I being present. A. RYAN.

E 5997/2429/25] No. 1. Summary of Discussion at Fifth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza, held at the Foreign Office on September 24, 1934. IT had originally been arranged to continue at this meeting the discussion begun at the^ second meeting (E 5908) regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. The instructions which Euad Bey had been expecting in regard to this question had not, however, arrived, and it was not possible to make any further progress with it. It was arranged that, if these instructions did not arrive before Fuad Bey's departure from England, Sheikh Hafiz would, on their receipt, acquaint the Foreign Office with their tenor. 2. Mr. Rendel asked that the Foreign Office might be given as full an account as possible of King Ibn Sand's views on the frontier problem well in advance of the opening of the proposed negotiations at Jedda. This would save a good deal of delay and reference home when the negotiations began. He added that he did not wish to begin by seeming over-optimistic with regard to the negotiations over this particular question. There were certain to be many points in regard to which the two sides would not see eye to eye. For instance, Fuad Bey had at the second meeting mentioned the Murra and Manasir as tribes which King Ibn Sand was likely to claim as his subjects. So far as the Murra were concerned, there was perhaps some reason to consider that they were closely connected with Saudi Arabia. The Manasir, on the other hand, seemed to be of more doubtful allegiance, and were stated to be largely dependent on the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Again, Fuad Bey had mentioned a claim as far south as the Qara Mountains. His Majesty's Government would certainly not be able to agree to anything so extensive. He mentioned these points to show that all would not necessarily be plain sailing. He was confident, however, that a friendly and reasonable settlement could be reached, and Sir A. Ryan would certainly make every effort to reach one, though he would necessarily be bound on many points by his instructions from home. Fuad Bey stated that bheikh Hatiz Wahba would also be available to help in the negotiations in Jedda, since he was proceeding on leave to Saudi Arabia at the end of the year. 3. In the discussion which followed, an opportunity was taken to remind Fuad Bey that the chief desideratum on the side of His Majesty's Government in anv general settlement would be a satisfactory settlement as i egai c s commercial relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. Fuad Bey suggested at one point that it might be better to balance this question against the problem of the oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, rather than against that ot the south -eastern frontier. He was, however, given no encouragement to p\i\ sue this line of thousrht Sir Andrew Rvan observed that a general settlement should be of the greatest advantage to King Ibn Sand in pursuit of his policy ot consolidating his regime in Arabia. u ^ oo f^of 4. The question of slavery was again touched upon, but it was cJeai that Fuad Bey was not in a position to add anything more precise to what he had previously said regarding the possibility of such action by Ibn Sand as would justify His Majesty's Government in renouncing their piesent light of manumission.^ ^ ^ ^ meeting Fuad Bey mentioned that his Government mio-ht perhaps feel inclined, during the forthcoming negotiations, to raise once more the question of the possible entry of Saudi Arabia into the League Nations The proposed general settlement would remove one of the factors which had in the past been considered a possible obstacle to the admission o Saudi Arabia to the League, namely, that country's ack of fixed frontiers. ATr T?pndel reminded Fuad Bey that the existence of slavery in Saudi Aiabia had also in the past been mentioned as a possible obstacle. Fuad Bey rephec that This question also was to be discussed during the negotiations, and if, as r206 aa—1]II 1 2 was to be hoped, some progress were made with it, it might be possible for Saudi Arabia to follow the precedent of Ethiopia and apply for admission to the League even in advance of the total abolition of slavery. 6. Fuad Bey also mentioned the subject of the indebtedness of his Government to His Majesty's Government, and adverted to the personal suggestion he had made to Sir A. Ryan earlier in the day. He emphasised however, the entirely unofficial character of this suggestion, and the matter was not further pursued.

When I was at home on leave recently I expressed the view in casual conversation to the India Office, and I think also to the Foreign Office, that in spite of Ibn Saud^ ostensible victory in the Yemen war, his - Ibn Saud^ - stock had probably gone down amongst the Arabs of the Persian Gulf. The reasons I gave were that when Ibn Saud made his victorious invasion of Yemen territory as far down as, and including,Hodeidah, there was much talk, not only in the Arab but in the English Press, of how he was going to follow up these initial successes; capture Bana, install his son Feisal as Viceroy of the Yemen, exact enormous indemnity from the Imam Yahya, and so forth, and that the final result fell far short ox these expectations# 2. I further expressed the opinion that the net result of the campaign in Arab eyes was that while Ion ^aud had secured Hejran, he had evacuated the whole of the Yemen coast-line, including Hodeidah, without extractiiio a penny of indemnity from the enemy. That the average Arab s idea of statesmanship was: M The good old rule, the ancient plan. That he shall take who has the power. And he shall hold who can', and that he would refuse to believe that Ibn ^aua would have given such easy terms to the Imam if he had been strong enough to impose severer ones. 3. During an interview which I had with the shaikh of Kuwait when I passed through there recently on my way out, / J.G.Laithwaite esquire, The India Office, London-2- A out;j he touched on 'the quest-ion of 'the Saudi-Yemen war, and said definitely that Ibn Baud's prestige had gone down on the .rab Coast ox the Gull as a result of that campaign# I enclose for ready reference an extract from a recent Kuwait Intelligence Summary, which is to the same effect. The factor of Arab public opinion with regard to Ibn Saud is of some practical importance as his authority over his subjects, especially over the tribal elements, depends a good deal on prestige. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and to Calvert at Jedda. i erhaps the Foreign Office would be good enough to give Ryan a copy.extract paragraph 102 of Kuwait Intelligence Sumruary Ho ,10 for the period 1st to 31st October 1934.

(a) Since the writer returned from leave, he has found many opportunities of discussing past Yemen events with a number of Bedouin trans-border Chiefs, as well as with the Shaikh of Kuwait and notables of the Town. On all sides he has been told thcit Bin 3aud has definitely lost much 'prestige' as a result of the War. Everywhere the belief is very strong that had Bin Saud been strong eough, nothing in the world would have prevented him i rom over-running or crushing Yahya. He however found himself in imminent danger alter his seizure of Hodeida, of being surrounded and his armies destroyed, so he wisely obeyed the instincts of self-preservation and made the peace he did. Yahya was also satisiied, being an old man and without aggressive ideas - for had he not won the moral victory and forced Bin Saud to withdraw, without so much as surrendering an inch oi Yemen territory, or paying a rial by way ol indemnity? (b) The barren Eejran after all was no gain to Bin Saud, tout has merely been given to her own people, the Yam tribe, who are blood brothers of the Murra and Ajman trxces. ♦ ♦ &lt;r ; »t ' CONFIDENTIAL.

His Highness is not sure whether Tibat actually falls v/ithin the limits o,- tine Sultanate ox not)# (ii) Thence to the south is interposed the Shamaliyeh which is not His Highness f s territory. Com mencing from the S.W. borders of the Shamaliyeh, i.e. including the whole southern bank of the Wadi el Qor the Muscat boundary passes along the western foot i--!,xis of the western Hajar Hills and at point iilast of Jabal Knadra swings south west to include Baraimi, the Sheikhsat-v (na of v.-hich oasis a *6 a q Sul'tan f s pay and ar6 responsibX6 for the safeguarding of routes in this area* (iii) Thence, towards the extreme south of his territories which extend to Ras Dharbat Ali ( to the west of the Province of Dhofar) the Sultan regards his limits as being terminated by the sands of the Great Desert ( Ruba'a Khali) - ( Note . North of the Province of Dhofar there exist three plateaus or ranges of hills which, taken in receding order from the sea are the El Qura Mountains, el Qatn and el Nejde The area known as el Nejd borders the sands of the Great Desert and is regarded as Muscat territory). (b) EASTERN BOUNDARY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH &gt; (i) The whole of the Musandum Peninsula north and east of the line roughly given under (a) paragraph (i), i and thence to Dibbah is Muscat territory.

My dear Gilbert, I have shown Walton's letter Ho.P.2.6039/34 of the 26th September, about frontiers in Eastern and South-Eastern Arabia, to Ryan who has read it with great interest. He says that he too has been attracted in the past by the idea of a settlement based on the attribution of tribes rather than of precise areas, and he still sees great force in the arguments adduced by Fowle in support of it. It should, he agrees, certainly be borne in mind as a subject for further exploration but it appears to be open not only to the objection indicated by Fowle himself in the second sentence of paragraph 7 of his note of the 21st September, a copy of which was enclosed in Walton^ letter to me, but also to the objection that, in the event of future economic developments, e.g. projects for exploiting oil, it would be very important to know to whom particular geographical areas belonged. As regards Fowle's own objection, it will, in Ryan's trlew, be of great importance to prevent Ibn Saud from establishing the position that he can extend his authority to the sea board between the coastal rulers. He recalls in this connexion a statement made not long ago by the Sheilch of Qatar that there was an area between him and the Sheilch of Abu Dhabi which they regarded as a neutral zone, but in which Ibn Saud exercised authority which they could not dispute. It is interesting to note that the frontier settlement between Iraq and lejd in 1922 was approached from the point of view of an attribution of tribes - see Article 1 ol the Treauy of Mohammerah. Ryan suggests that it may perhaps be worth while to refresh our memories as to the evolution by which that Article was superseded some months later by the first Protocol of Uqair. 2^ j not myself think that there is any fundamental disagreement between Fowle and ourselves. e fully realise that allegiance/ iai thwai te, Esq.,% ' ? 2. Arabia is 'tribal ratiier than territorial, and that it is not physioally possible to draw clear-cut frontiers in the desert. ^e are indeed already approaching this question on a tribal basis, e.g. we have asked Fuad Hamza and the Saudi Minister to let us know over what tribe r Ibn Saud claims to rule. Nevertheless, the difficulty foreseen in paragraph 7 of Fowle f s note is a very real one. If we were to try to define Ibn Saud' s dominions merely by tribal allegiance - and we are agreed that some definition has now become necessary - nothing Y /ould be easier than for Ibn Saud to claim rights over all members of his tribes wherever they were in Eastern or Southern Arabia, and to use tribal migrations for pegging out claims vtiich would eventually become claims to territorial sovereignty. 3. The fact is that the old days of personal, as opposed to territorial, nationality are coming to an end even in Arabia. Kven there territory, like territorial waters, must bear some kind of national label - even if it is only an artificial one - ^ because it is no longer politically practicable, with modern developments such as air communications, the discovery of oil and minerals, etc. to have a vacuum. 4. Our suggestion for a definition of a South Eastern frontier for Saudi Arabia, which should be theoretically co- terminous with the frontiers of the territories of the Arab rulers under ©ur protection, was intended to take all these factors as far as possible into account. My own idea was that the frontier should, wherever possible, be laid down - theoretically and geographically, and not, of course, on the ground • in the emptiest possible places and as far as possible from the areas effectively administered by either side. It would correspond to a line dividing national rights over certain wide gulfs or inland seas. It would then be possible to work on the basis of the existence of a wide geographical belt on the sesmrd side of the new frontier, which would be in effect a no-man's- land which we should not regard outselves as bound to protect in any sort of way, but where Ibn Saud would be precluded frqca 0 pegging/3. ,territoror claiming any territorial rights. ' i ' ou remember that the Air Ministry have always taken the line that the Royal Air Force must have a fairly large area of Yirtual no-man 1 s-land in which 'to turn round' • It seems to me that if the artificial frontier were pushed as far into the desert as possible, it would be possible for the Air Jkinistry to regard this wide belt on the seaward side of it as a sort of empty area which would enable them for example, to pursue retreating raiders without crossing Ibn Saud 1 s frontier. 6. The artifiaial frontier line thus laid down would, therefore, be more of an insurance for a remote future against unnoticed and dangerous expansion than an effective 'frontier' ^ even in the sense of the desert frontier between Saudi Arabia \ and Iraq,. Ho doubt Ibn Saud's tribes would migrate from side to side of the frontier. 2hey would remain his subjects, but if they reached any places where there was a territorial administraflb&amp;n on the non-Saudi side of the frontier, they would be subject, as foreigners, to the territorial administration. G?he position would be much the same, in fact, as it is in Horth-Eastern ^-'ransjordan or Western Koweit, where tribes owing allegiance to the various territorial rulers concerned wander backwards and forwards but still maintain a main habitat or domicile in the country of their main allegiance and are subject to various local arrangements, so as to avoid duplication of taxation etc. 7. I fear that I have set down our views on this subject at rather undue length, but I thought that you might care to Kave a full statement of the position from our point of view, and might perhaps like to have them in a form in which they could be communioated bodily to Fowle.

Thomas was informed confidentially of the difficulties which have arisen m connection with the Blue Line ana the general position was discussed with him. It was agreed that steps should be taken to obtain a report written by him on the air route reconnaissance of 1927 from the Gulf ana he kinaly consented to answer a Ciuestionnaire to be compiled after that report had been seen if we should so aesire. His views on the following points of general interest were as follows. Desirability ana practicability of fixed bounaaries. Mr. Thomas, in the li &amp; ht of his experience of Arabia saw very strong objection to laying down fixed boundaries as represented by a line on the map in the hinterland of the Trucial sheikhaoms ? kuscat, etc. Such a line was meaningless so far as tribes and local rulers were concerned. The tribal boundary was txie only real one. Moreover, the situation in the hinterland was essentially fluia ana a line which might represent the position at the moment woula be unlikely to ao so 9 say, in ten years' time, even ii the general political situation remained the sane, ana certainly would not ao so once any major political alteration (such as one death of Ibn Saud, the death of Ibn Jiluwi, ol tne reasseitioi^ of the influence of Abu Lhabi) haa takun place. 3/ zsismamm- 2 - 3. FossiMlity oi settlement on a trToal 'oasis . While a tribal basis was likely to be very much more satisfactory than a territorial basis 9 Mr. Thomas saw great difficulty in a settlement of this nature. He admitted that it might be possible to ear mark settled elements of particular tribes such as the Manasir and to separate them from the nomad elements ior the purpose of a tribal settlement. But he repeated that tribal allegiances were very lignt ana varied very rapidly ? that the area of the ciira or circle within which a tribe operated might well be affected by failure of grass, etc. , and that imiviaual sheikhs were not necessarily in a position to pledge their tribes to a certain allegiance. What had in practice in the past determined Tribal allegiances had been the wealth j the personality and the power to bring pressure of the more important rulers at any given time, whether in Nejd, in Muscat, or in Abu Dhabi ? ana he thought we snoula be incurring great risks if at this stage we entered into any written settlement witn Ion Saud which attributed certain tribes to him. Incidentally the Manasir were historically an Abu Dhaoi trioe, although in the Last five or six years they had paid Zakat to Ibn Saud. 4» Ton Saua's influence to the east of the Blue Line and the payment of aakat, Mr. Thomas in the first place coniirmed a suggestion already made from the Gulf that zakat represented no more than a mllo form of insurance carrying with it no suggestion of suaeralnt^y or sovereignty and corresponding closely to the ancient aanegeld. It would be dangerous in his view to base any/- 3 - any settlement merely on the fact that zakat had been paid oy a particular tri'be at any given time* What in practice happened was that a tribe which louna. itself engaged in hostilities with another neighbouring trihe 3 v^hich ? like itself, haa not paid zakat to ? say 5 Ihn Saud, seized the opportunity, hy sending a camel or some small similar tribute to Ihn 3aua to secure his moral support in any raiding which it mignt unaertake. The danger and the occasion over, the payment of zakat woula lapse. Or again, nomad tribes might tender an offering to Ihn Saua, or to Ihn Jiluwi, if they found themselves in trie course of their wanderings near the borders of Nejd or close to some area in which Saudi influence was strong. Ihey certainly woula not regard themselves as committed to any permanent allegiance to Ibn Saud by such a payment. Or again, a member of the sheikhly family, who had designs on the ruling sheikh, or who found, himself threatened by that sheikh, would send a present to Ibn Jiluwi by way of strengthening his hands against his own ruler. 5. Influence of Ibn Jiluwi .. Mr. Thomas was of opinion that the influence of Ibn Jiluwi was the most substantial feature of the Sauai regime in north-eastern Arabia. Ibn Jiluwi 1 s strongly marked personality, his strength,, ana his severity had acquired a great' influence lor him among the Bedouin. IirMr. Thomas' opinion the influence of the Saudi Government in the hinterland of tne area to tne east of the Blue Line was likely to be very substantially reduced with Ibn Jiluwi's death. Ion saua, unless he coula fina an equally aominating lieutenant, woula not himself be in a position to carry anything like so much weight. _/- 4 - * U o ^ 6 • T he religious conxMint, . iviT. Tiioiiius said tliat there was no Question of tne ruadirii trices of Oman being willing to accept Saudi overlordship or enter into relations with Ihn 3aua. They were definitely and positively hostile on religious grounds and would certainly oe opposed to any 3auai attempt to absorb them. This was true to a less extent of the shafi tribes, which might or might not be prepared in certain circumstances to support or pay zakat to Ibn saud. 7, Baralmi . The tribes of Baralmi, v^hile one section of them, the El Siiamis, had paid zakat to Ibn Saud, wouia certainly strongly resent any endeavour on his part to exercise effective control over them. In this connection Mr. Thomas referred to the great importance up to recently of Abu Dhabi, a sheikhdom which had for very many years been the most powerful in the Persian Gulf, 8. As regards the boundaries of Muscat , the position was that it was difficult, if not impossible, to set out their specific limit in the hinterland. The Imam ana tne Ibadhi tribes were for practical purposes, though not lormally, independent of the sultan. For religious reasons they would, however, be likely to be equally hostile to ion Sauo. In tne bouth—east, in Dhofar, there had never been any question of Saudi influence. Ibn Saud had sent emissaries to the Saar, Manahil, etc. But these tribes, together with the El Kathiri and the Lahra trices of the soutnern steppe, did not pay zakat to Ion Saud and had rejected overtures made/made to them by emissaries sent to them 'by the King. The tribes which used the sands did pay zakat to Ibn Saud in a loose sort 01 way, but it would be dangerous to hase too much on this. tJ. &amp;»L # 19.10.34o INDIA OFFICE.No. 1054- S of 1934.

ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF rilS BWTANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT South-East em Frontiers of Saudi Arabia.—{Record of Conversation with with Saudi Ministry on October 3, 1934.) FOLLOWING on the arrangements made at the second meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 20th September, the Saudi-Arabian Minister and Mr. Zada called on Mr. Rendei on the 3rd October ostensibly to inform him of King Ibn Sand's views in regard to the possible revision of the tc blue line ^ fron tier. Sir A. Ryan and Mr. Johnstone were also present. 2. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba began by explaining that he had now heard from Ibn Saud, and that the King considered that the frontier should follow existing de facto line which had been tacitly, though not formally, agreed upon between himself and the Sheikh of Qatar as the southern limit of the latter's authority. This boundary, though never actually defined, had long been tacitly accepted and had never given rise to any trouble, and the King would be prepared to reach an agreement either with the Sheikh of Qatar direct or with His Majesty's Government on this basis. 3. Mr. Rendel said that this was, of course, only a small portion of the frontier, but that it seemed to him that what the sheikh had just said was really begging the question. His Majesty's Government could not admit any line other than the ' blue line,' on the ground that it had been tacitly agreed to or accepted and had not given rise to difficulty. It was precisely because no agree ment had been reached about the frontier and because difficulties had arisen that the question was now under discussion. Moreover, His Majesty's Government were responsible for the foreign relations of Qatar; there could, therefore, be no question of a direct agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and Ibn Saud in regard to the frontier. The position was that His Majesty's Government regarded the ''blue line' as the legal south-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia. They were prepared as part of a general settlement not to take their stand on the strict letter of the law, but to agree to some modification of the line by mutual agreement. 4. What the Minister had said gave a fairly clear indication of what King Ibn Saud's desiderata might be in regard to the Qatar sector of the line. But it was even more important to know Ibn Saud's ideas in regard to the remainder of the ' blue line.' Fuad Bey, at the meeting on the 20th September, had spoken of claims to the areas inhabited by the Murra and Manasir tribes, and extending as far south as the Qara mountains. The claim to the Manasir might give rise to difficulties, and His Majesty's Government would certainly not be prepared to consider any claims extending as far south as the Qara mountains. What His Majesty's Government wanted to know was how far King Ibn Saud's claims really did extend. It would, for instance, obviously be useless to pursue the discussion if King Ibn Saud were putting forward claims extending right into the territory of Muscat. Before negotiations could be embarked upon, it was really important to know what the King was asking for. 5. The Saudi Minister said that he had received no instructions in regard to anything but the Qatar sector of the frontier. He understood that the King proposed to communicate his views to Sir A. Ryan on the latter's return to Jedda in December, when negotiations would be opened. 6. Sir A. Ryan pointed out that this carried us no further at all than the Saudi Government's last note on the subject. 7. Mr. Rendel said that His Majesty's Government considered it most important to have some indications of King Ibn Saud's claims and desiderata before Sir A. Ryan's departure. He repeated that the present position was that October 3, 1934. Section 1. [E 6160/279/91] No. 1. Anglo-Saudi Relations. [231 c—1]His Majesty's Government took their stand on the ' blue line, but that they would be prepared to make some concession in this area as part of a general settlement. But before deciding whether any such settlement were possible, it was essential that they should know what King Ibn Saud was asking for. If King Ibn Saud was claiming virtually the whole of South-Eastern Arabia, it might be useless to pursue the matter. In any case, it was necessary to issue detailed instructions to Sir A. Ryan for his guidance in carrying on any negotiations. These instructions would have to be elaborated in consultation with several other Departments of His Majesty's Government, and it would not be possible to consider them until His Majesty's Government knew what King Ibn Saud wanted in this matter of the south-eastern frontier. He therefore suggested that the Saudi Minister should telegraph to his Government and ask for telegraphic information on this question. 8. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba agreed to telegraph his Government forthwith, but said that the King would probably require time to make enquiries from the tribes, &amp;c., in the area in question. 9. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the King was apparently claiming an extension of his dominions to the east and south-east of the ' blue line,' on the ground that certain tribes inhabiting certain areas in this part of Arabia had always owed him allegiance. Surely the King must know which tribes owed him allegiance and which did not, and must already have the necessary information as to the areas which were inhabited by the former. King Ibn Saud could hardly claim the allegiance of tribes which he did not know or sovereignty over areas regarding the limits of which he was ignorant. 10. Sir A. Ryan added that King Ibn Saud knew more about this part of Arabia than anyone else, and must certainly already possess all the information required in order to enable him to formulate his claims. 11. It was agreed that the Saudi Minister should put these points to Kincr Ibn Saud by telegraph, and communicate with Mr. Rendel again as soon as he received a reply.
