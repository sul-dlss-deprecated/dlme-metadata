They are now advised that in view of rule 7( 1)(a) of the Arms Pailes, 1924, which imposes an absolute 'ban on the importation of prohibited 'bore weapons and leaves no discretion to the Central Government to relax the rules, permission to import such 'weapons cannot 'be granted, aiiven apart from this legal objection, the need for checking the entry of weapons of prohibited bores is the greater in war time and it is considered that the rule should be strictly worked.

Most respectfully I beg to say that during January 1945 when I was on vacation in India I had applied for a shot-gun licence. The matter was still in progress that my vacation ended and I came back to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia with ray employers, the Arabian American Oil Company for whom I am working for the last ten years. The matter of the Licence was left with ray attorney who has now informed me that I have been granted an All India Licence by the District Magistrate, Benares, (U.P). My present agreement expires after about sixteen months when I will retire from the Company service. By that tirae, I am afraid, ray licence may be cancelled because I do not own a gun yet. As, you know, guns are very scarce in India these days, I intend to order a gun directly from England and take it with me to India on retirement. For this I seek your help by permitting me to import a 12 bore double barrel shot-gun against my licence. On receipt of the gun I shall give it in your custody or of the Bahrein Government until the time I return home. I hope you will favor me with this permission for which I shall ever remain grateful. I am. Sir, Your most obedient servant. f-?s- Ajaz Ahmad, c/o Arabian American Oil Company, Bahrein Island, (Persian Gulf). s ■! * V VNo.2281-9/1.

J lie Dear Sir: At the beginning of 1940 a Rifle Section was formed as part of the Bapco Club, and a miniature rifle range is maintained in Awali as part of employee recreational facilities. At the time of the form ation of the Rifle Section, ,22 calibre rifles were imported into Bahrein for the Club and also as the private property of individuals. The Board of Trustees of the Bapco Club now wish to import four addi tional rifles as replacements for the ones ordered in 194-0, and several employees have expressed a wish to import rifles for their own use to enable them to enjoy the shooting facilities offered by the Club. It would be appreciated if a No Objection Certificate could be issued for the import of the above four .22 calibre rifles for the Bapco Club, and confirmation that similar rifles may be again pur chased by Bapco Club Members for use on the Club Range and imported into Bahrein under a No Objection Certificate which will be applied for when the number of rifles required is known. ^ours very truly.

As a result, of requests from Ar*eHLoan staff to be allowed to taVe ' i r aafjas vri' r. ther to Kirrait, we recently referred this question to our local manacenent with the request tivvt they should tahe up the matter with the Political Agent. '.Te have near heard from Ktarait to the effect that in Tandy's viewi- (-} t^ere is no objection to the inportation of shot ^mo for which no perrdt need be obtained, (' , i / importation of any other type of arr^s should be prohibited and no application to ir^&gt;ort pistols, rifles, etc., should be approved, and (iii; only shot £un anmmition nay bo irported. lan iy considered., bovover, that his views should be confirried by his successor. ( I, therefore, discussed this question infomally with Colonel Galloway in London. His reaction was that he would prefer to wait until lie could exaidne the vrtiole natter at Kivait and, in consequence, we infomed cur American vartners that apnrcr/al to the import of fireams into K'lwa- 1 1 American personnel shotild be v /ithheld pending a final decision by Colonel Galloway. Since then we have received further info^Taation from Kuwait to the effect that it i s no^Y possible to purchase sriot ^uns and .22 rifles and aimunition for these weapons in the Kuwait bazaar, ' In these circumstances you will appreciate that It is difficult for us to withhold further our general approval to British and American emnloyees belnf- allowed to take shot guns and .22 rifles with then to Kuvalt. Before we take the matter further, however, we should be very ff rateful for an authoritative ruling on this issue.

There has been a system in force in the Oulf States for many years whereby a no objection certificate has to be obtained from this Residency before fire-arms and ammunition can be imported. This system was introduced long before the Oil Companies came into being y possibly to meet the requirements of Article 6 of the Arms Convention of 1919. and has been of use in ensuring the strict observance by the rulers of their under takings regarding the arms traffic. 3* So far as the import of arms by personnel of Kuwait Oil Company is concerned f we understand that Major Tandy shortly before his departure consulted the Shaikh who said that he saw no objection to the import of shot-guns by the Oil Company's personnel but would prefer that they did not import pistols or Rifles. So far as this Residency is concerned we can see no objection to the import of ,22 rifles and are asking the Political Agent to consult the Shaikh on this point. 4* We arei however y strongly opposed to permission being granted to the personnel of the Kuwait Oil Company to import pistols and rifles of a larger calibre than .22. Some of the personnel of the Oil Company can be described as 'tough* 1 and we do not war t to run the risk of American gunmen and others shoot ing up each other in the camp or Arabs outside the camp 9 especial} as there is at present no police force capable of dealing with such a situation if it were to arise, 6. The Oil Company propose to appoint a few police officers and we are inclined to think it desirable that they should be permitted to import a limited number of rifles and pistols which should be kept in an armoury for the use of these officers and other selected personnel in an emergency. We intend to consult Colonel Galloway about this proposal after his arrival and will pursue it further if necessary. Yours everPOLITICAL AGiiNCY, BAHRAIN, No. 1703-9/1 x ^st June 1948.

Birmingham, England.CIV \ ^ Jf ^ m 22 RALOrR A S|iortiiig Rifle witli an entirely new Sell'-lnading Action The B.S.A. 'Ralock' is a .22 semi-automatic or self-loading Sporting Rifle incorporating a number of new and unique features, the most important of which is a radial action in place of the more usual reciprocating holt. This principle reduces wear through friction to a minimum and ensures a smooth and fast-working action. Another new feature of major interest is the entire absence of an external ejection opening. Unlike any other rifle where individual cases are separately ejected, all spent cases are retained within the weapon whilst firing, but can be released^i^will b^i^-cocking the action. The numbered illustrations show many of the features i.. detail- ■ AF S^E 2 3 A SalVly Caleh with a moaning When the safety catch is applied, the letters of the word SAFE are correctly aligned as shown on the left. When the safety catch is released, the word SAFE is divided, exposing a red warning disc as shown on the right. The new self-loading action in the cocked position. Simple and robust construction have been the keynote of design. The action in the closed or fired position. The radial movement of the block reduces wear from friction to a minimum. The action, of unit construction, is entirely enclosed and protected from dirt, but instantly removable for examination and 6 dec aiung. The rifle is loaded through an opening in the butt. Special tubes are available for rapid re-loading. The combination of under-lever cocking and entire absence of ejection opening, together with retention of cases within the rifle, con stitutes a marked advance in sporting rifle design. Rapidly detachable barrel enables the Sports man to make certain that the chamber is empty when unloading, and facilitates clean ing when necessary.Details of the New // M RALOC k *22 Self-loading Rifle Designed to meet the popular demand for a .22 Sporting Rifle with semi automatic action the B.S.A. 'Ralock ,, has a number of outstanding features that will be readily appreciated. As shown overleaf, the action is of entirely new conception, the breech block having a swinging or radial movement as opposed to the usual reciprocating type. Loading is effected through the side of the butt, the cartridges being fed into the action by a spring-loaded magazine which is withdrawn beyond the opening for this purpose. After the rounds have been inserted and the magazine closed, the gun is cocked by operating the cocking lever. Each round may now be fired by repeated pressure on the trigger only. Empty cases are released by operating the cocking lever, which allows them to fall freely from the rifle and eliminates the usual violent side or bottom ejection of hot and dirty cases. Ipenoral Specification 1 he barrel is 22 inches long, bored and rifled with customary B.S.A. precision. It can be supplied chambered for .22 short only or .22 long rifle ammunition only. The stock has a pistol grip and the fore-end is of semi-beavertail design. 1 he rearsight is adjustable and with bead foresight gives a sight base of 18 inches. Overall length of the weapon is 38^ inches and the weight approxi mately 6 lbs. I he magazine has a capacity of 12 short or 8 long rifle cartridges. B.S.A.
