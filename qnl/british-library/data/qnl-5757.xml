Foreign Office, January 27, 1904. Sir, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople regarding the possibility of serious disturbances in the neighbourhood of Koweit.* It would appear from this despatch that the warning recently given by the Viceroy of India to Sheikh Moubarak may not permanently deter him from aggressive action, and that the sincerity of his protestations of loyalty and friend ship on that occasion is open to doubt. I am accordingly to suggest, for Mr. Brodrick’s consideration, that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should, as on previous occasions, take an opportunity of informing Moubarak that the good offices of His Majesty’s Government promised to him under the Koweit Agreement can be extended to him only if he is guided by their advice and refrains from any aggressive action.

Sir, I have the honour to report that I proceeded to Koweit on the “Lawrence with the Political Resident at Bushire, and arrived there on the 1st instant. * Sir N. O’Conor, No. 11, January , 1904. 3attacked and expelled them. The original Sheikh came down the Khor Sobieli, between Bubian Island and the mainland, with his followers, and settled in the bay known as that of Koweit or Grane. Crossing the hay he settled on its southern shore, and there erected a small fort or “ kut,” of which the word Koweit is the diminutive. The term Grane or Kurn is rather applied to the shore line of the entire bay, from its resemblance to the curve formed by two horns. The Settlement was subsequently augmented by the son of the founder, who erected more buildings along the seashore as the population increased. The town is clean and active, and the bazaars extensive. A series of breakwaters and shallow docks made of rough-cut stone blocks stretches along the foreshore, which is entirely affected to boat-building. The sailors of Koweit are in high repute. Boat-building is their sole industry. Builders were ori ginally brought from Muscat, but the local workmen are now sufficiently skilled to work independently. Wood is imported from Malabar. The principal houses are of stone, and the population about 18,000. There is no vegetation nearer than Jehra, which lies about 15 miles away at the head of the bay. The Bedouins who flock to the town and camp on its ourskirts supply the population with provisions. Sheep and goats are imported from the Persian coast and Bahrein. Horses from the interior are no longer exported from Koweit, as this trade has been deflected to Bussorah. The water obtained from w r ells near the town is brackish, but fever is unknown. Colonel Belly reported in 1863 that, though nominally tributary to Turkey, they had for some years hoisted their own flag. It was found, however, that the custom duties, levied on their exports to Bombay, were more burdensome when goods sailed under an unrecognized flag, than when they were borne in Turkish craft. Koweit, shrinking from this foreign pressure, turned to the Sultan. The suzerainty of the ports, whether old or recent, was merely nominal, the Arabs acknowledging the Turks as we do the 39 Articles, which all accept and none remember. I have, &amp;c, (Signed) T. E.

O'Conor ,— (Received at Foreign Office, February 20.) (No. 5. Confidential.) Snt, Basoa, January 25, 19C4. In the course of an interview with the Vali to-day, I mentioned that I had recently visited Koweit and heard that Sadun Pasha was then near Jehra. I added that it was extremely unlikely that Sheikh Moubarak w-ould give him any assistance or countenance his proceedings in any w r ay. The Yali replied with some bitterness that the Sheikh’s tolerating his presence at Jehra was already sufficient protection, for, as long as he remained there, Turkish troops could not touch him. He was as much out of reach at Jehra as he would be at Koweit, and quite safe from interference. I asked his Excellency what he expected Moubarak to do in the matter, to which he replied, te He might take him and hand him over to us.” I said I thought that would be rather a serious breach of the Arab laws of hospitality, 5and might lead to a general rising of all the neighbouring tribes, out of sym pathy for Sadun. If his presence at Jehra meant freedom from molestation because he was on Koweit ground, it would clearly he impossible for Moubarak to so far depart from established Arab custom as to make him a prisoner and give him up. I remarked that I had heard Sadun had since quitted Jehra and gone further north, where it would doubtless be easy for them to catch him. The Yali said it was no easy matter to catch an Arab wandering in the desert, where Turkish troops could not follow him. Moreover, Seyyed Talib Pasha, acting on instructions from the Porte, had been sent to interview him and had found him at Jebel Sinam. Sadun had asked for the Imperial pardon. His Excellency informed me that, when the trouble first began, he antici pated Sadun’s departure in the direction of Koweit, and had asked the Porte for instructions as to how he should act in the event of his proceeding there. The Porte merely inquired what grounds he had for supposing he would do so, but gave him no indication as to the course he should pursue. Any attempt to corner Sadun would merely force him to return to Jehra, where they could not follow him. It is evident that the Turks have no intention of burning their fingers by following Sadun into Koweit territory, and it is also clear, from the Vali’s statements, that he considers Moubarak is conniving at his escape by allowing him to visit Jehra. The matter will probably end by a full pardon being grant ed to Sadun, and his settling at Sahhra, near Nasrieh, while the blame for the slaughter of the Turkish troops will be laid at the door of the Bimbashi and others, who have already paid the penalty for their imprudence with their lives. If, however, this should not be the case and Sadun returns again to Jehra, his presence there will be a standing irritation to the Turks, and may bring Koweit into undesirable prominence. Moubarak is “ between the Devil and the deep^ sea.^ If he delivers up Sadun to please the Turks, he offends Arab sus ceptibilities seriously, and if he leaves him undisturbed at Jehra, the Turks may, with reason, grumble at Koweit’s being used as an asylum by the Sultan’s enemies.

It would seem advisable therefore that you should take a suitable oppor tunity of reminding the Turkish Government of this understanding, and should intimate that as His Majesty’s Government have recently given repeated warning to the Sheikh of Koweit against participating in any insurrectionary movement, they have a right to expect that the Turkish Government will use their best endeavours to restrain the Amir of Nejd from embarking on a course of action which might endanger the peace in those regions.

We should be glad to know whether a representation has, as suggested in Lord Curzon’s telegram, dated the 28th April 1904*, been made to the Porte, and, if so, what the result is. It may become necessary to revive the proposal to post a British Resident to Koweit in order to watch events there in the event of armed inter vention in this quarter being persisted in by the Turks, but we could hardly interfere so as to prevent the importation of arms for Bin Saood. 1 1Telegram, dated the 25th May 1904. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Londrm ,^r To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Please refer to your telegram dated the 20th May 1904 regarding Nejd affairs. Representations were made by Sir N. O’Conor to the Porte on your telegram of the 28th April and were renewed on hearing from the Vice- Consul at Jeddah that troops were being assembled at Medina in order to assist the Amir of Nejd. He says that these representations may perhaps make the Sultan reluctant, hut that they will hardly turn him from the course which he can fairly urge is calculated to prevent internal troubles and disturbance of the status quo. He adds that he does not see on what grounds he can press the Turks to desist from helping the Amir, who is the party attacked without appearing as a distinct partisan of Bin Saud. He also ad verts to questions of general policy, and points out that on these grounds there are objections against preventing the Turks from assisting the Amir against Bin Saud whose apparent object is to re-establish the Wahabi dynasty through out Central Arabia, result of which might in the near future be fraught with serious consequences and might imperil our authority at Koweit where in the existing condition of affairs our influence is yearly growing stronger. Sir N. O’Conor’s idea is that we should confine ourselves for the present to maintain ing intact territory of Koweit and awaiting developments, but that if the Turks persist, as he anticipates, in assisting the Amir, it might be expedient to reconsider the question of appointing a Resident at Koweit. Please let me have your views on the above questions. In view of our declared policy of prohibit ing the traffic in arms, how would you propose to keep from interfering with the importation of arms for Bin Saud ? Please see your telegram of the 25th May 1904. uur position in regard to the affairs of Nejd is explained in our Secret Despatch No. 69 of 24th March 1904. Representations might be made by Sir N. O’Conor to the effect that so long as the Turks refrained from interference in Nejd affairs, we also abstained from intervention ; that we have no desire to assist Bin Saud directly or indirectly; but that our interests in Eastern Arabia are such that we cannot view with indifference intervention on behalf of one of the parties contending for supre macy in Nejd which must affect the tribes with which we have relations; that the relative rights of the two contending parties being so equal that the better course would be to leave both sides alone, both in the interests of peace and with a view to the avoidance of internal troubles. It might further be pointed out that the Turks were unable in 1902 to prevent filibustering expedition against Koweit starting from Turkish territory, and that the present support of Bin Rashid may strengthen him beyond Turkish powers of control, and produce situation which, having regard to our relations with Mubarak, we could not view with indifference. As to Sir N. O’Conor’s view of the general political aspect of the situation, our opinion is as follows : the growth of our influence with Sheikh Mubarak has been concurrent with the success of his friend, Bin Saud, and our prestige at Koweit must suffer materially if, through our active inter vention to prevent Mubarak assisting Bin Saud, and to prevent importation of arms, we permit Turkish influence to determine supremacy of the Turkish nominee against Bin Saud, which on analogy of the case of El Hassa of 1871 would probably mean absorption of Nejd by the Turks. The destruction of Mubarak’s influence and a possible attack from a direction which has not hither to been contemplated on Koweit territory, the limits of which towards the in terior are not defined, would naturally result from Turkish supremacy in Nejd. Telegram No. 1748-E.A., dated the 29th May 1904. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty’s Secretary o£ State for India, Lo 1We might thus be forced again to assist Mubarak actively against the Turks. The re-establishment of the Wahabi dynasty, which is now rather territorial than fanatical, would, in our opinion, be open to less objection than this. We cannot agree therefore that our authority at Koweit would be imperilled by the success of Bin Saud, or that we can preserve Koweit territory intact better than by preventing Turkish intervention on behalf of Bin Kashid. With reference to my telegram, dated the 20th May 1904, we quite agree as to posting a Political Agent at Koweit and will immediately select one if you approve. We think it not improbable that such action might have a whole some effect upon Turkish attitude of mind. Up to the present no arrangements have been made with the Porte for combined suppression of traffic in the importation of arms which is briskly proceeding. It is not therefore a case of authorising Mubarak to import arms or even of relaxing existing measures for the prevention of the traffic, but of merely allowing matters to remain as they are. We can, if the Turks protest, offer to do our best to prevent trade on the understanding that they will refrain from interfering in Nejd affairs, and co-operate with us in the manner suggest ed in our Despatch dated the 31st March 1903. An admission of our supremacy in Koweit that would be useful to us hereafter would result from such a protest. 2 G. C. Press, Simla.-No, 601 F, D.-1.6.04.-5J.-J.W.V r ' ) 'T No. 2918 E.-A. The UNDER-SECRETAKT to the GOVERNMENT oe INDIA in the Foreign Department^ Major P. Z. COX, c.i.e., POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Dated Simlay the 7th September 1904. I am directed to address you regarding tlie recently-created appointment of Political Agent at Koweit. 2. As notified in Foreign Department telegram No. 2457, dated the 3rd August 1904, Captain Knox will take up the appointment, hut will so act as not to attract unnecessary attention. His first object should he to cultivate and maintain close and friendly relations, with Sheikh Mubarak and the principal personages in Koweit. The interests of British trade and traders at Koweit and in the adjacent tracts of Arabia should be safeguarded, and a vigilant watch kept over the proceedings of the Turks on the boundaries of Koweit territories. Matters tending to show an intention, on the part of the Turks or any other Power, to interfere with, or disturb, the existing status quo or anything which would lead to a belief that any other Powers have designs on, or in connection with, possible harbours within or without Koweit territory should at once he reported. Special regard in this respect should be paid to Khor Abdulla and the waters round Bubiyan Island and Um Kasr, but Captain Knox should be careful not to display undue apprehension or uneasi ness on this point, or, in default of definite instructions, to interfere actively in matters affecting these places. 3. Any attempt on the part of the Turks, or others acting from Turkish territory, to encroach on or beyond the limits of Hejeje and Subhieh should be forthwith reported. Captain Knox should, however, endeavour to ascertain if these places really represent the bounds of Shiekh Mubarak’s effective occupation at present. 4. He should further endeavour to secure early and accurate information regarding the struggle between the Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud families for the supremacy of Nejd. His Majesty’s Government have instructed Sir Nicolas O’Conor to inform the Turkish Government that, as repeated warnings have been given to the Sheikh of Koweit against participating in any insurrection ary movement, they have a right to expect that the Porte will use their best endeavours to restrain the Amir of Nejd from embarking on a course of action which might endanger the peace in those regions, and the Ambassador has been further requested to express the hope, in regard to the assistance given to Ibn Rashid, that the Turkish Government will avoid taking any action which might still further add to the disturbed condition of this part of Arabia, the tranquility of which is a matter of interest to His Majesty’s Government as well as to that of the Sultan.In connection with this question I am to forward, for your information, a Telegram from Secretary of State, dated the 8th CC W °f the marginally noted COrrespond- February 1904 . ence regarding proposals to obtain more 26 th e MaS I 904 . cretary ° f StaU&gt; ’ No ' 69 ’ the pliable information regarding the situa tion in the interior of Arabia. 5. The Government of India also desire to he furnished with information regarding the trade in arms with Koweit, and how far, if at all, arms are .being especially imported through Koweit for Ibn Saud. Pending further instructions, the Political Agent should neither authorise nor forbid Sheikh Mubarak to continue the trade which already exists.

After the elapse of a reasonable interval he should be withdrawn, but instructions might be given to him to inform the Sheikh, before leaving that he will repeat his visits and that the date of his return will depend on the course of events. He might add that the Sheikh should address the Resident, Bushire, if events should occur or communications be made tending to affect the position ot the Sheikh in regard to Turkey or any Foreign Power during the absence of the Agent from Koweit.

I request, therefore, that you will consider the question of the date to be fixed for the temporary with drawal of Captain Knox, and inform me of your views on the point. 3. As regards the instructions contained in your Foreign Department letter No. 2918-E.A., dated 7th September 1904, to Major Cox, for the guidance of the Political Agent at Koweit, I observe that it is stated that that officer should endeavour to secure early and accurate information regarding the struggle for the supremacy of Nejd ; and that Major Cox has been furnished 211 and 215 with copies of my telegram of the 8th February last, and of your Secret letter Secret E, 0 f ^ 26th March last, 69.

India Office to Foreign Office. V, India Office, ’ 13th August 1903. SlR » With reference to Sir N. O’Conor’s telegram No. 112, of the 18th ultimo, and to my letter of the 23rd ultimo, forwarding a copy of a telegram to the Viceroy on the subject of the expediency of appointing a British Kesident to Koweit, I am directed by Lord George Hamilton to inclose, for Lord Lansdowne s information, a copy of a telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 31st July 19 3, reporting the views of the Resident in the Persian Gulf and of the Government of India upon the proposal. As to the Viceroy’s reference to the proposal to place Koweit under the ’( charge of the Consul at Mohammerah, it appears to Lord George Hamilton that, apart from the reasons which led to the recent decision to retain Mr. McDouall in that post, there are objections to entrusting our relations with the Sheikh ot Koweit to a Consular officer residing in Persian territory. Moreoier, H Lordship is unable to understand in what respect such an arrangement won be preferable to that which at present exists, by which Koweit is under the general superintendence of the Consul-General at Bushire, who is also Political Resident for the whole of the Persian Gulf, and who has a steam ship at his disposal for the purpose of visiting the ports under his charge when it is necessary to do so. . With regard to the suggested appointment of a British officer to reside in Koweit, it appears to Lord George Hamilton that such a step would s ^ ai ® e 7 in harmony P with the admissions which have repeatedly been made by His Majesty’s Government that Koweit is within the Turkish Empire. is P 01 ^ however is one pre-eminently for the Foreign Office to consider, and, apart from this, His Lordship is inclined to attach more weight to the reasons given25 by the Viceroy in favour of the appointment than to those urged against it ^ by ® Colonel Kemball. As an alternative he would suggest that it will be sufficient for the present to instruct the Consul-General at Bushiie to depute^ an officer to visit Koweit from time to time, remaining there for such period as may be desirable. Business connected with the Sheikh’s relations with Turkish officials at Basrah would, as at present, be conducted through His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah. I am, etc., A. GODLEY. The Under-Secretary of State, Eoreign Office. Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. SlE, Eoreign Office, 13th August 1903. I am directed by tke Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, forwarding copy of a telegram from the Viceroy of India, in which he advocates the appointment of a British Resident at Koweit, proposed by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, unless the alternative proposal of the Government of India be accepted, that an officer of the Indian Service should be appointed Consul at Mohammerah, who should also have Koweit under his superintendence and be provided with a vessel for the purpose of making frequent visits to that place. As the Secretary of State for India is aware, Lord Lansdowne is of opinion- that the Consul at Mohammerah should devote his attention to the very important questions of trade and roads in that locality and the surrounding districts. It appears to Lord Lansdowne to be undesirable that he should be taken away from these duties for the purpose of dealing with an en tirely different class of questions connected with Turkish Arabia. His Lordship is unable to see that there is any force in the argument advanced by the Viceroy that visits to Koweit by His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah would strengthen and recognise the connection between that vilayet and Koweit. The Consul is at the present moment the necessary intermediary between the Sheikh and the Vali in the many questions which arise as to the Sheikh’s property, and it might equally be agrued that visits by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire to Bahrein indicate a connection between the latter island and Persia. Lord Lansdowne does not, however, wish to press the proposal, suggested originally by the Secretary of State for India, that the British Consul at Basrah should be placed in regular superintendence over Koweit. The present system under which His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, or one of his officers, is the ordinary means of communicating with the Sheikh has, on the whole, worked well. On the other hand, the appointment of a British officer to reside at Koweit permanently could scarcely be considered otherwise than as a departure from the status quo, on the maintenance of which His Majesty’s Government have hitherto laid so much stress in these discussions with the Porte, and Lord Lansdowne would be averse to such a measure unless the necessity for it is clearly apparent. If it should be considered expedient to resort to it, it would probably be best that the officer selected should at first visit Koweit temporarily from Bushire, and repeat his visits at intervals until his residence became practically permanent.

My Lord, With reference to the Secret telegram from the Government of India to Lord George Hamilton of the 31st July last, I beg to say that I entirely dis agree with Major Kemball’s theory that while affording the Sheikh of Koweit naval protection as against the Ottoman Government, we are under no obliga tion to interfere with any aggressive or hostile proceedings which he may take against a tributary of Turkey such as the Amir of Nejd. As a matter of fact the Porte have on more than one occasion asked that the influence of His Majesty’s Government may be used to prevent the Sheikh from marauding or attacking his neighbours. The immunity from Turkish aggression which His Majesty’s Government has desired to secure to him seems to me to carry with it the responsibility of preventing him, as far as lies in our power, from under taking offensive operations against chieftains or tribes assumed to he under the suzerainty of Turkey. The arguments in favour of the appointment of a Resident at Koweit are so clearly set forth in the Viceroy’s telegram that I feel there is no necessity to make further remarks, except to. express the hope that the proposal may be favourably entertained by His Majesty’s Government. I have received Your Excellency’s Despatch No. 459 (Secret) of the 10th instant, advocating the appointment of a British Resident at Koweit. I have already been in communication with the Secretary of State for India in regard to the questions raised in the telegram from the Government of India of the 31st July, to which Your Excellency refers, and I transmit, for * From India Office, dated 13th August 1903. y oUr information, copies of the COlTCSpond- To ditto,dated 13th August 1903. ence * which has passed on the subject.

Sir,- ' 27 to appoint a British officer to reside permanently at Koweit, such a course would scarcely be in harmony with the admission which has repeatedly been made by His Maiesty’s Government that Koweit is within the lurkish Empire, and could, indeed, hardly be considered otherwise than as^ a departure trom the status quo, on the maintenance of which His Majesty s Government have laid so much stress in their previous discussions on the subject. I concur in Your Excellency’s opinion that His Majesty’s Government mav not infrequently find themselves called upon to exercise their influence in restraining the Sheikh from attacking his Arab neighbours as well as in pro- tectin 01 him from aggression at the hands of the Turkish Government. Bu that influence has upon more than one occasion been so exercised under exist ing conditions, and a perusal of the printed confidential correspondence during the months of September and October 1901 in particular shows that the media tion of the Political Resident and of British Naval officers m the Persian Gulf was successfully employed at a time of serious inter-tribal disturbance, and that it was received by the Turkish Government with satisfaction. ^ The conclusion of the hostilities then in progress between the Slieikh of Koweit and the Amir of Nejd was followed by an amicable understanding with the Turkish Government, recorded in my note to Anthopoulo Pasha of the Ilth September 1901, which has since that date formed the basis of the relations between the two Governments, and the adoption of the present proposal might seriously impair its successful continuance. His Maiesty’s Government are, therefore, of opinion that it will be best, for the present at least, to avoid raising a difficult and inconvenient question with the Turkish Government by appointing a British officer to reside per manently at Koweit, and that it will be sufficient that an officer should be deputed by the Consul-General at Bushire to visit Koweit from time to time, remaining there for such time as may be desirable, and, if necessary, repeating his visits at intervals until his residence becomes pratically permanent. * or the reasons stated in the correspondence inclosed in this despatch they are also of opinion that the attention of His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah will be more profitably directed to the very important questions m that locality, and they consider that business connected with the relations of the Sheikh with Turkish officials at Basrah should be conducted as heretofore through His Majesty’s Consul at that place.

Sir, With reference to your letter of 1st September, relative to the proposal of the Government of India that surveys more extended than those already sanctioned, should be undertaken by the Investigator in the neighbourhood of Koweit, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to enclose copy of a Despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople containing observations on the subject. Lord Lansdowne concurs in Sir N. O’Conor’s opinion that there is no objection to the proposal. The second paragraph of the Despatch deals with more general questions, and I am to request that Mr. Secretary Brodrick’s attention may be parti cularly called to His Excellency’s observations in regard to possible represent ations by the Turkish Government on the subject of the appointment of a British Agent at Koweit. The Turkish authorities have already taken notice of the change, as will be seen from the Despatch to Mr. Townley, No. 363 copy of which is enclosed, and it appears to Lord Lansdowne very desirable to decide what answer should be returned to any further enquiries which may be made. After correspondence between the two Departments in August 1903, the conclusion was arrived at “ that it would be best, for the present at least, to avoid raising a difficult and inconvenient question with the Turkish Government by appointing a British officer to reside permanently at Koweit, and that it would be sufficient that an officer should be deputed by the Consul- General at Bushire to visit Koweit from time to time, remaining therefor such time as might be desirable, and, if necessary, repeating his visits at intervals until his residence becomes practically permanent.” His Majesty’s Government are, therefore, in a position to maintain that no permanent appointment has been made by them which could be regarded as a disturbance of the status quo in those regions, and Lord Lansdowne would suggest that the Turkish Government should be so informed if they raise the question. It might be added that while the mission of Major Knox is a special and temporary one, His Majesty’s Government must, in view of their arrangements with the Sheikh, reserve to them selves the right to depute an officer to visit Koweit from time to time, at their own uncontrolled discretion as to time and length of stay, in order to report upon the state of affairs at that place and to ensure the successful continuance of the modus vivendi already arrived at. It is, however, essential, should this line of argument eventually be adopted, that the policy agreed upon in August 1903 should be strictly carried out by the withdrawal of Major Knox from Koweit after a reasonable interval. I am, therefore, to suggest for Mr. Brodrick’s consideration that the Gov ernment of India should be reminded of the limited character of Major Knox’s mission, and should be invited to indicate a suitable moment for his temporary withdrawal.

With reference to your Despatch No. 326, of the 13th September, respect ing the proposed survey operations of the Investigator, I do not think much is to be gained by abstaining from surveying the Khor Abdullah and the Bubiyan Island channel out of complacency to Turkey, while on the other hand, having in mind the disputed ownership of the island, we should, if anything, gain' something by making evident to the Turks our views in regard to that question. I have had no answer as yet from the Minister for Foreign Affairs with reference to my demand for the withdrawal of the Turkish Military Station on the south-east (A1 Geit) point of Bubiyan, but, on the other hand, I have not pressed the matter very hard, as I have kept it as a reply to the representa tions which are likely to be made at no distant date in connection with the appointment of a British Agent and the establishment of a British Post Office at Koweit.

The Turkish Government had been informed that Major Knox, Assistant in the Consulate at Bushire, had been selected for the post. This arrangement appeared to them to involve an unwarrantable disturbance of the status quo.

H “ Highness said that it was most undesirable that any steps should be taken which might be interpreted as an intention on the part of His Maiestv’s Government to encourage the Sheikh of Koweit, who had given th^Tirkish Governmentconsiderable trouble by his constant intrigues with men like Sadun Pasha and other turbulent elements. ,, 1 re P 1: ed that I had no authority to discuss the question at length, but that no doubt His Highness was in possession of a report of a recent conver sation which Musurus Pasha had had with your Lordship upon this subiect as communicated to me in your despatch No. 365 of the 20th ultimo, and I did not think there was any need for me to say more. I would add, however, 2935 F. D. 1 ‘ 33 :J 35 that His Highness must he well aware that the efforts of His Majesty’s Government had always been directed to restraining any inclination on the part of Sheikh Mubarrak to mix up in the quarrels which were perpetual in the interior. Ferid Pasha then repeated that anything which the Sheikh could interpret as a disposition on the part of the British Government to encourage him was to be deprecated, and be expressed the hope that His Majesty’s Government would issue the necessary instructions that Major Knox should leave Koweit, as the Porte could not but consider his presence there an infringement of the status quo, I here took occasion to remark that the continued maintenance of a military post on Bubian Island was looked upon by His Majesty’s Government in the same light, and I reminded his Highness and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was present at the interview, that the note verlale from the Embassy protesting against its continuance still remained unanswered. Tewfik Pasha replied that he had explained to Sir Nicholas O’Conor that the military post had been established on the island for the protection of the fishermen on the coast, and that Sheikh Mubarrak had never established any claim to the island, which was a barren, uninhabitable waste. I refused to discuss the question, and contented myself with saying that His Majesty’s Government did not share the views of the Ottoman Govern ment on this question, and that Sir Nicholas O’Conor had certainly not taken His Excellency’s verbal statements as an answer to the note.

A simple examination of the question would convince me of this. I was doubtless as anxious as the Porte for the strict maintenance of this under standing arrived at by the two Governments on this subject, and the Imperial Government felt sure that a study of the documents would of itself be sufficient to enlighten me. His Excellency was therefore instructed to press for the prompt recall of our Agent. 1 told the Ambassador in reply that, in view of the attitude of the Turkish Government in regard to the Aden Irade, I was not prepared to discuss this question.

Recent information received by the Imperial Government showed tha^ Major Knox was not alone at Koweit. He had with him eight Spahis; he had taken into h:s service as Secretary a man named Abdulah ; he had entered into relations with the natives, was interfering in affairs of administration, and had hoisted the English flag over his residence. The Imperial Ottoman Government felt sure that Lord Lansdowne would not rail to see that these proceedings, which gave to Major Knox’ Mission a c aiacter very different from that which it was represented to be, were in contravention of the Agreement arrived at between the two States in regard to the status quo at Koweit. R xc ®R enc y was therefore instructed to press for the immediate recall ot the Agent in question. I promised His Excellency that I would at once make inquiry into the facts. I imagined that officials travelling in that part of the world usually took with them a certain number of retainers, but that I could not admit the correctness of the information which the Turkish Government had received, ° r ^ n ?° unce action which His Majesty’s Government were likely to take, until I had ascertained what had really taken place.

Sir, The Marquess of Lansdowne has given careful consideration to tbe telegram from the Viceroy of India of November 19th regarding Koweit* enclosed in your letter of the same date. .This telegram is an answer to a telegram from the Secretary of State for India of November 11th, in which it was stated that, in view of the general situation elsewhere, His Majesty’s Government considered it desirable that Major Knox should be temporarily withdrawn from Koweit, in order not to raise a difficult question with the Turkish Government at the present moment; the Government of India was accordingly requested by Mr. Brodrick to con sider the question with a view to fixing the earliest possible date for his with drawal. When the Viceroy’s telegram of November 19th was despatched, the Government of India had not received Mr. Brodrick’s communication of November 11th, which gives a detailed explanation of the policy of His Majesty’s Government and it is possible that, had this information been before them, the view taken by the Viceroy might have been somewhat modified. But in any case Lord Lansdowne cannot think that the view taken by the Government of India is altogether well-founded. It appears indeed to be based upon a complete misapprehension of the circumstances in which His Majesty’s Government gave their sanction to the deputation of Major Knox to visit Koweit as an Agent of the British Government. His Majesty’s Government have neves agreed to the appointment of a British officer to reside permanently at Koweit. This course, which was ^suggested for consideration by Sir N. O’Conor in his telegram No. 112 of July 18th, 1903, and supported by the Government of India in their telegram of July 31st, was discussed at length by the two Departments in the correspondence noted in the margin. Copies of these Omitted m Foreign Office etter. letters were no doubt forwarded to India in the ordinary course, and the decision of His Majesty’s Government is clearly and sufficiently summarised in the following telegram, dated August 26th, from the Secretary of State to the Government of India:— “ On the whole His Majesty’s Government consider that the proposal to appoint a British officer to reside permanently at Koweit could not but be regarded as a departure, only to be justified by clear necessity, from the status quo which they have insisted upon so strongly in their discussions with the Turkish Government. Pro posal to take Consul at Mohammerah away from his commercial duties in Persia in order to deal with questions of an entirely different class connected with Turkish Arabia is also one to which the Foreign Office object. It is considered that the existing system, under which the ordinary channel of communication with Koweit is the Besident in the Persian Gulf or one of his subordinates, works well on the whole. Closer touch with Koweit could, if found necessary hereafter, be gradually established by repeating at intervals temporary visits of selected officers until his residence becomes practically permanent.” It would obviously not be consistent with the policy thus expressed to make an immediate and permanent appointment of a British Agent to reside at Koweit, nor would it be possible to reconcile such an appointment with the assurances given to Turkey regarding the maintenance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf ; on the other hand, the deputation of an officer to visit Koweit from time to lime as a temporary measure has received the full approval of His Majesty’s Government, and it was- always intended that in any communi cations which might take place with the Turkish Government the right to take this step as often as it may seem desirable to do so should be absolutely reserved. -4 A© 2^ i»- 1 38 India ™ggested,m their telegram of to Knweff TT^Tir h - t * th . e “ oment was opportune for the despatch of an officer ther -® 18 s Government gave their sanction to the proposal, but conditions'mmn'wV?' 0 !'ti! 611 '!, t lat . there should be “y departure from the onditions upon which they had originally insisted. meet^ r fo' LanSd0 'm‘’fu 9 ’ SeOTetai 7 Brodrick is aware, every desire to mtmHon of +i,»°f lb H he Tf v eS ° £ the Government of India.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your No. 144, dated 31st January 1905, calling for an early report regarding the Turkish Ambassador’s complaints contained in Foreign Office telegram No. 400-E.B. 2. I can only conclude that the first portion of the first complaint refers to the survey measures taken by the Commander of B.I.M.S Investigatory while the latter portion probably refers to Mr. Gabriel’s visit to Um-Kasr. The British functionary may be myself, and it is hardly necessary to say that no attempt was made by me to incite Arab tribes to submit to Mubarak. I doubt if I spoke to or met with twenty persons outside my camp following between Subiya and my return to Jahra, as I carefully avoided all commu nication with the natives at either Um-Kasr or Sefwan, and the rest or the country was uninhabited. 3. As regards the second complaint, I have never heard of nor seen the British flag hoisted on Sheikh Mubarak’s residence. The reference may be to the hoisting of a flag by the Officers of B.I.M.S. Investigator on the Sheikh s residence at Sirrah, a conspicuous and convenient point for survey operations.

I then asked the Sheikh for a definite statement on the subject of quarantine for the next fast mail • I said that I was at a loss to know what was really decided, for he himself gave orders that Koweit passengers were to be overcarried to other ports such as Basra and Ilti&amp;aamerah and the minute he was out of the town,Sheikh Jabir gave orders that there was to be no quarantine*The Sheikh said that he intended his orders to be carried out that pass engers should be overcarried and that n.e would inform Sheikh Jabir to that effect•Tne boats swould, go to the mail to convey intending passengers (I would ask you kindly to note thht passengers are V “ . apparently to go by the fast mail as usual )but the boatmen have no business on the fast mail and should not go on board, 3 # Two more interesting admissions were made in the course of conversation (a) that British ships were British ships and that both Persians and Arabs were there as guests and should obey their rhost/s orders and behave themselves* (b) that the people of Koweit were just like the people of ahj- other place in the world and that there were good and bad peorle among them. These considerations might seem sufficiently obvious but the obvious re quires so much explanation in Havre it that it is a matter for congratulation when it is thoroughly un derstood and admitted. P. It would seem from the whole course of the correspondence and interviews that we have got Sheikh !lobarak alarmed end in a yielding mood, at least temporarily and it would be as well if poss- -ibleJpace more important political considerations. if any,)to keep him so gent ly and judiciously .He must have suffered in prestige by launching his thunder bolt against the local Agent,Hirza Idummiad,which fell so remarkably flat and the lame explanation he on nobody least of all in this town. He brought the I had not the slightest ulterior intention in raising quiry or uunishment in the absence of instructions. casual as a thing that should hot be altogether I feel quite certain that the merchants will not be able to hold out long against the stoppage of tne not be able to enter into effective negotiations gives of that order in his last letter will impose the question;! had no notion of asking for an enBritish India S.N.Coy. 10 Hie re yfls no doubt as to what is -;t the bottom of the whole trouble .The Sheiiiii cannot tolerate the notion that there should be anybody in this to\jn who^ should have any authority,of how ever restricted a Lind, in his tom except himself. He resents the British India Captains -referring complaints re outrages to me.He equally results the Company’s Agents referring complaints through ~ance that the British India soeamers are the pro perty of Sheikh Hobarak and the Company’s Agents are Sheikh Mobarak’s Agents. For a time all goes well under these condi tions but Sheikh Mob arak himself is now seldom in Koweit and it is a singular thing that these outrages generally occur when Sheikh Mobarak is away from Koweit.The position then rapidly becomes impossible. Quarrels occur on a hundred minor matters and the Political Agent cannot possibly remain a disinterest- -ed spectator. 11. There remains the question of quaran tine and vhe general conduct of the steamers* busi ness in Koweit.The discontinuance of the steamers* rXx yisits to Koweit has been suggested by yourself in £ this connection and you were followed by my self in my .letter Ho.3^&lt;§'dated the- 1908 on the subject of quarantine .It is quiteKpossible that this whole incident was clumsily engineered with a view to showing that the Koweit people are independent of the British India steamers and that it is to that extent an answer to the veiled threat contained in the passage quoted belo?? from your letter to Sheikh Mob arak tea No. sMS&amp;the 7th &lt;M me **And especially now that ocean going steamers visit your port it is not pn^nh'i i y on wish ) my self.He takes seriously Mr.Iyle’s polite assur- 1908t/nem to that jou can dispense witn all preventive measures against the entr^ r of disease? It might be urged that to discontinue the steamers now will be regarded as done in obedience to She!nil Mobarah* s orders.Such a misconception will be sedu lously fostered but I do not think that we need allow such considerations to trouble us.Sheikh iio- barak at least will not be deceived. 12. It will be understood from this that I am still inclined to think that it would be well to discontinue the visits of the steamers for a bime and to explain clearly to Sheikh Ilobarhc tnat ones; will not be allowed to return until tne ouai antine question as regards British steamers is satisfacto rily settled from our point of view. The line of argument that I should adopt would oe tnat iiooody is compelled to travel by British steamers unless they want to and that the English have a perfect right to do as the} please with their own steamers and to make what rules and regulations they please. The penalty for foolish rules and* regulations is not in the hands of Bheikh Hobarak but that the English t/iii lose passengers and caip»o if they hamper their trade with foolish restrictions. Consetantious ob jectors can stag - at hone tout that we shall regard as unfriendly an’d disloyal any order, open or secret, forbidding Koweit subjects generally to travel by Bril ash st earners. Vfe regard as equally unfriendly his drastic order compelling unfortunate passengers to go on to Pao or lluhammerah exposing them to quaraitine and a great loss of time and money .This is doing so.He is spriviu^ unpopular on account of f an order to impose quarantinewhich ho prebends he is willing to obey. 13. .Another point that it will be necess ary' to make clear before his rnl itions with the B.I. Company are re-established will)5 be that Govermaent through its Resident and Agent is going to come into the agreement not on behalf of this Company or that Company but on behalf of British steamers generally. That it must be clearly understood that complaints regarding British steamers vrill be submitted through the Political Agent, the proper channel for such com plaints and that his representations must be received in a friendly and conciliatory spirit and tnat he is entitled to be present at the Sheikh's enquiry'. That hasty and ill considered telegraphic orders to stop all cargo being shipped,ordering an inoffensive British Indian subject out of the town without fault alleged or shewn to the British representative re siding in Koweit and refusing to send tally clerks at a moment's notice in breach of his agreement with the Company are all \mfriendly acts, inviting reta liation on our part, 14 # I feel sure that Sheikh ifobarak will not be able to hold out for any length of time agains the complete stoppage of steamer traffic out io would do no harm to tell him that we shall regard any lengthy consideration of these very' lenient customary and reasonable conditions as equally un friendly and a disregard of the prosperity and quiet he has enjoyed through our protection.We shall in such a contingency take such other steps as may seem good to us to ensure compliance with our proposals. Should the Sheikh reply, as he probably will,that he does not require such protection, it would ce as well to tell him unreservedly that we came hero as much in our interests as his own, that we have kept our side of the bargain and intend to make him neep his and that the agreement between us cannot be'0 f broken except with our consent which we shall give . when and if it suits us and not Bheikh Hobamk. 1 have ’the }\onour to be. o 9 Bir, Your most obedient servant.No of 1908 British Residency and Consulate-General £ Bushire, Augu- 4 - ^ Bushire To v The Political Agent K 0 W E I T Eir I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.469, dated 19th August 1903, on the subject of the ’’Waroonga’ incidentj I am telegraphing the gist of it to the Resident.

I regret to have to state that no favourable opportunity far such a step has yet presented itself, nor does the idea seem feasible under the altered conditions in Turkey. An interpellation of several of the Ministers has been an nounced on the subject of the Baghdad Railway Concession, though for one reason or another it has, so far, on each occasion been postponed. Attached to this have been questions regarding the rights of Russia to railway construction in the Black Sea basin, and regarding the status of Koweit, which latter the late Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me he would have no difficulty in avoiding by the statement that it was a matter the discussion of which was undesirable for reasons of State. The press/ has also several times referred to alleged British encraachments at Koweit, once undoubtedly at German (or Austrian) instigation. Only two days ago the Shura-i-ummet in commenting on international politics, attributed the satisfac tion of England with the establishment of the Constitution here to the prospect of its interfering with Germany’s commercial privileges in Turkey, and instanced the appearance of the Koweit question simultaneously with the grant of the Baghdad Railway Concession as a proof of this. It(g) -oy It Will D3 necessary to treat the matter with great caution, ! ' //oalcl probably bo best to allow it to remain dormant for the present at all events, if indeed the Turks on their side allow it to remain so. It must be very carefully borne in mind that Turkish rights and claims bear a very different complexion now fl ° m ‘ Vhat tix6y dld under ths old regime, and will need to be treated with great circumspection so long as the new order of things lasts, at all events until we see clearly the groove into xkx which the new regime will settle.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Depart ment endorsement No. 2356-E. A., of the 21 st December 1911, and to recall the fact that Shaikh Mubarak was consulted by me on behalf of the Government of India regarding the proposal to communicate to the Porte the details of his engage ments with us. 2 , In these circumstances, I would ask Government to consider whether it is not now advisable for us to apprise the Shaikh of the action we have taken. If the Government of India generally agree that it is expedient to make some intimation to him, and to do so now, bhen I would ask them to consider the precise form of the communication which I am to make. There would seem to be three courses open to us ( 1 ) to inform the Shaikh that “ the terms of— (a) the agreement of 23rd January 1899 ; (&amp;) the arms agreement of 24th May 1900 ; (c) the postal agreement of the 24th February 1904, as per translations attached, have been communicated to the Porte who have been informed that His Majesty’s Government hold, moreover, a lease of land from him,” thus refraining from special mention of the omission to communicate a copy of Colonel Meade’s supple mentary letter of 23rd January 1899, or the substitution for it of the observations contained in the second paragraph of Sir Edward Grey’s communication to Tewfik Pasha, dated 24th October; ( 2 ) to include a quotation of these latter observations in our written communication; ( 3 ) to quote them verbally, simultaneously with the communication suggested in ( 1 ). 3 . If the general negotiations with the Porte were likely soon to be brought to a conclusion, it might not be considered necessary to make any communication to Shaikh Mubarak at present, pending that development; but the danger is that he may conceivably learn details in the meanwhile from Turkish sources or be pressed for further information by the Basrah authorities, in which case he might presume that we had communicated to the Porte more than we had, and be led by want of precise details into making inconvenient disclosures. 4 . I shall be taking an early opportunity to proceed to Kuwait to carry out the instructions of Government with regard to the presentation of the Shaikh’s recent decoration, and it would be convenient to me to know the views and wishes of Government in the connection under reference before leaving. I, therefore, solicit a telegraphic reply.Bushir©, 23rd.

I arrived at Uo'hanmerah in His ; ajeety’a Chip **Sphinx' on the evening of 4th instant end was fortunate In finding Shaikh Lob&amp;rak still staying with the Shaikh of' *-ohamraerah. Captain Shakeepear, Political /igent at Kuwait, had also ai^- ranged to rendazvouo with me there. 3. On the morning of 5th Major liaworth and X had a long interview with tho Shaikh of Kohaamerah alone. Wo read him a translation of tlio Agreeeiont regarding the Frontier, as initialled, hut described the oouree of it from its point of contact with the Khaiyln, to the sea, as indicated by tl&gt;e line shown in tits map, in emendation of the description given in the Convention* having to some extent forgotten the details of whet p&amp;ssdd at our Interview with him of 90th August 1912, I &gt; IIKII —- —-r— - Vide Residency letter wo* 1956 n , dated 25th 1 August 1912, to Hwft Jovemmoht of India • iJhaikh iQiasal was in'the Foreign Department. I inclined to start old hares on the boundary line, such as the 1mid-charmol theory; but on the whole, except f^Fthe necessity of travelling over old ground again, we had little treble in this connection# The Shaikh did not again raise the question of the definition of ”connection w , in reference to the rela tion of islands to the Rain-land at low water; while on the subject of Hakki Pasha’s reservation in regard to the Xhaiyin lands, he was surprisingly sensible, confident no doubt in the thought that in view of established local facts, it has no concrete significance. 4. W© then went on to deal with the question of the Ri verain Cotaniiscion, in which connection translations of such of the provi cions of the Convention as affect %ham: ©rah were read and explained to the Ghaikh. He was very uneasy as to the probably troublesome results which might be expected to ensue from- the control of the whole of the waters of the river, and voasols afloat thereon, by a Turkish Coisrniosion, and from the Inevitable activities of Its oubordinate employes. In discussing this problem he again raised the question of i the mid-channel line, arguing that from.the point where the K&amp;run, a Persian river, joins the Shatt-al-Arab, it surely was only fair that Persia should share the possession of the river. But as M&amp;ji Rais was not present on this occasion and we had already been talking for over 3 hours and the Shaikh was get ting tired, we were unable to dispose of the question of the Comnisalon at thio sitting and therefore adjourned, leaving the translation with the -haikh for further study and discus sion with h&amp;ji Hals* and with the intention of finishing with it at the Ghaikh’a return visit to me* Meanwhile, and indeed all along, the latter expressed hie firm intention, after talking things out, to comply with our final advice in the matter* 6 . Before parting company I asked him to arrange with his guest, Shaikh Mobarak, for me to visit hi© the following fore noon, and told ;dialkh Khaza* briefly what I had to say to the former* himself took a sensible view of the question of the location of &amp; Turkish Agent, recognising ite on© convenient aspect jaspect, I*s. ac an Indication of Shaikh ^obarak # 8 autononcuo position} and h© promised to endeavour to influenoe hie friend in the right direction, 6 * At Shaikh iQm&amp;al** vioit to the Consulate on 7 th, he was accompanied by Haji Hale, and they brought an old volume of treaties In Persian, containing the text ©f the Treaty of rseroum, relying on which they started the mid-channel ques tion again* All the old ground had to be gone over onoe more, but the shaikh and his factotum were ultimately persuaded that the recognition of the Turkish claim to the whole river as provided by the Treaty of Srxereu* with the alternative of an appeal to the Hague, had been a necessary step in order to secure, in the Shaikh’s own interests, the frontier that he wanted from the Tuw&amp;iriJ southwards to the Khalylm and that no useful object would result from any attempt to reopen that question now* 7, This point having been finally dispoced of, the question of the powers of the Riverain Commission and the de legation of Mohamm+nte interest© to the car© of the British Commissioner was then gone into* We found that the right of the Commission to deal with vessele in touch with the Persian Bank greatly exercised boto the Shaikh and Haji Hals, espe cially in view of toe wording ©f toe ©entance in the decla ration stipulating that toe functions performed by the Com missioner supervising to© interests of the Shaikh of Poha»- merah mist b© discharged without prejudice to hie quality as a Pember of toe Turkish Comrdasion* The Shaikh feared toe contingency of to© British OoEniasioner, perhaps a stranger to himself, being over-influenced by his Turkish role and perhaps led to act against Mohamrerah Interests arbitrarily without consulting its Ruler. We endeavoured to persuade him that his apprehensions on this point were premature and that the British Commissioner would surely receive all such pre liminary instructions from the British Government as might be nocossary to ensure Moharanerah interests being really pro tected. Tvontually we arranged in concert to© draft of a letterletter of acceptance for the Shaikh to sand tso, and thlo he ' aicloaure 1 . $ did in due course* I attach a translation thereof and trust that the Shaikh’s acoonnanying stipulation will not be considered inconvenient or unreasonable. After settling the terras of this draft we adjourned to other natters of business* I need not dilate upon the extreme Importance of lotting the Shaikh feel that the British Comiesioner will really be in sympathy with him and see that hie interests are fully pro tected. ito this end I would urge Govamraent to be pleased to consider the expediency of putting forward for selection as British Comisoioner the nases of officers conversant with the politics and if possible the languages of the Shatt-al- Arab region# as being likely to have a better chance of est ablishing confidence and sympathetic relations with the Shaikh* to 8 . X now beg to turn/ray dealings with the Sheikh of Kuwait. Captain Chako op ear and I interviewed him at Fall iy eh on 8 th ^uly&gt; Shaikh Khasal being also present* I took up the thread with Sheikh Mob&amp;rak from tho point where the Political Agent had left it as reported in my telegram 1:0.948. dated to© Secretary of State’s telegram of 17th June - alternative (ii)* was read to him. He demurred somewhat at the excision of Uraa Kasr and Bafwan but had apparently resigned hinself to their loss and ae regards the rest of the boundary he acmiie©- oed in it practioally without remark. In too remaindor of toe Kuwait articlos there were throe points on which he had something to say. (i) . the clause in article ( 8 ). providing for the location of a Turkish Agent at Kuwait. (ii) . the use of the word *:£halaf* { ) w BUccoooor w and not “aol&amp;d* ( ) » sons, in article 2. (ill)^ III (lit5• tho clause providing for the eotabliehnont of Cus toms Offices in article 8 . It was iton (i) with which the diecuasion which fol lowed was mainly concerned, but it will be nore convenient to dispose of (ii) and (ill) first, 9. As regards the question of terminology in (ii), I was not positive off-hand what the A r abic word used in previous engagements with him was, but vdthout pursuing that point it was explained to his that as the Turks had expreesely un dertaken not to interfere in the succession, it seemed of little consequence whether this particular Convention used the word 'successor 1 * or son© other cognate expression, as the question was one which rested between himself and us alone, /£ Without the Arabic text It was difficult to say more on this point than what I have recorded above; but it is referred to /\Enclosures 3 and 4,| in th© shaikh’s letter to me and my re ply. It will be found that in the Thwaikh hgroenont til© word • sons** (aolad) was not used as the hhaikh tiiouglit but the word •heirs* (warasah), and that we managed to fonce with th© J tide oorroapojvionce ending with foreign I dynastic issue tlien &lt;4 ,va department letter da- *3&gt; ted 18 th h&amp;rch 1908. Vi ^ I raisod by the Shaikh, My written reply to the latter (enclosure 4) leaves th© ques tion in th© cam© position as did the Chwaikh Agreement, and I shall bo glad to know what further, if anything. His -aj©sty's . CfOVoirtment would wish n© to say to him. It might be worth while,if Shaikh kobar&amp;k himself wishes it, that we should of fer to recognise his successor - presumably his son and deputy Shaikh Jabr - in his life time. This would probably cat his mind at rest completely as regards his own succession and load him to forgot or drop all further efforts to secure a perma nent dynastic guaranty®, I solicit telegraphic orders on this point, (ill). The Cun tons clausa, at which h© at one© called a halt, brought us on to somewhat dolicata ground, but it ceened to me that the bast line to taka was that the Article discussed contingencies wiiich might never take chap©, bo that in anycase it seemed premature to com.e to Issue over them no\T, 'fie Trent on to explain that if tho Railway did eventually come to Kuwait, it would obviously b© unreaeonabl© for him to expect to receive tho duty^or all the duty,on through cargo, and that in any cas© a preliminary discussion and arrangement would have to b© arrived at between the Porte and ourselves, acting in his behalf, for regulating the distribution of the duties on through export or import cargo at Kuwait in a manner fair both to himaelf and to Turkey* In regard to local cargo hi a rights would of course have to be specifically separated or safeguarded* I expressed the personal view that this was an instance in which our interests and his would be the eatne and that it would be our business to see that he was fairly treated* Shaikh Kh&amp;zal gave useful help in getting Kobarak to view tills question in a sensible light# 10 * W# now com© to hie main objection, the clause requiring his to receive a Turkish 'Corrasissaire* or Agent In Kuwait* Hero, to begin with, Shaikh Mobaratc ?/ao bluntly imoo^- promlcing, saying that it wao one of tho specific and chief features of hie agreements with us that ho should refuse to receive the agent of any Foreign Power including Turkey, and that the admission of any representative on the part of the 'Turkish Government in Kuwait was the one thing that he had bewn always determined to resist a l f outrance and had up to now succeeded In withstanding* Then followed a long discussion in which the case of Egypt and the argument that the appointment was a useful indi cation and necessary result of tho recognition of his admi nistrative autonomy were made the most of. Eventually he agreed, provided that I would confirm the purport of their message in writing, to bow to the will and advice of His ma jesty # s Government, relying on their assurance of tho identi ty of our interests and on the enjoyment of their efficacious support In‘case of need agftinst trie activities and intrigues on the part of the Turkish Agent which ho instinctively appro hended, and which he feared would prove no less a worry to ourselvesT * ourselves than to him. I was not specially authorised to give him the purport of the Secretary of State’s telegram in writing! but I do not think I should have got his assurance in writing without it, and my refusal to give it would have aroused undesirable suspicion of our good faith in his mind. 11, We separated a few minutes later and he subsequently sent me the letter of acceptance of which I attach a tranola- Knclosure tion. Hie first portion is based on lines sug gested to him by myself; the remainder, from the words ”1 would only represent” onwards, is not meant by him to detract from his acceptance; but merely reminds us of the 5 questions of Succession, Customs, and Admission of iXiropean foreigners to Kuwait in connection with which he either foresees difficulty and claims our support, or feels that the situation needs clear ing by the light of the Convention. \7ith the first two matters I have dealt sufficiently in • the foregoing paragraphs. As regards the third, hie future attitude towards foreigners, Shaikh hobarak incidentally re ferred to the question of the overtures made to him in the past by Messrs wonokhaus &amp; Co,, and enquired whether his obligation to adrait a Turkish Agent involved any obligation or permission to admit other foreigners. I replied that our advice to him to keep Kessrs wonokhaus and others at a safe distance had re ference partly to the indefinite nature of his status vis a vis the Turks, a fact which was likely to afford such persons oppor tunities for intrigue. I continued that my personal view was that the regulation and establishment of his status by the pre sent Convention somewhat altered the position, but X explained that the terns of the convention only provided for and referred to the admission of a Turkish Agent, and did not affect his existing understanding with us as regards others; so that X considered that it was still obligatory for him to consult us before admitting other foreigners. I concluded, however, that I would, if he desired, make a fresh refe'renoe to Government with regard to the case of Messrs Wonckhaue and ascertain their views.

Before concluding this somewhat lengthy report, I should like to avail myself of the opportunity now that those portions of the Convention affecting the Shaikhs of Kuwait and -ohammerah are practically completed, of recording my acknowledgments for the loyal co-operation which I have received throughout from Captain Shakespear and Major Haworth, the Political Officers accredited to those potentates, at my recent interviews and in the spade work done on the spot in connection with the details* I have the more reason to appreciate this in that owing to the absence of direct telegraphic communication with, either port, and the fact that many of Government’s references needed speedy telegraphic reply, I have been unable always to consult them before replying as freely as I should wish to have done; but Government will, I am sure, appreciate the fact that the amen able demeanour of the Shaikhs is due in no inconsiderable mea sure to the happy relations existing between them and the two Political Officers attached to them* I also wish at the same time to commend to Government the excellent work done and valuable assistance rendered to me by Captain A*T.Wilson, in connection with the Mohammerah frontier question* 14 .

(Dated, Mohaimnerah, 7th July 1913)* I have received your esteemed letter of 6 th July 1913 (1st Shaaban 1351) and understood its contents, in confirma tion of what you explained to me verbally at our interview today (i.e. 6 th July). I trust you will inform the British Government that I recognise and admit the force of your explanations that my interests and those of the British Government are identical and that there is no difference between them; and according ly it is incumbent on me to rely upon the advice of the Great Government in this matter; but they will, I am sure, under stand that when any doubt enters my mind and I see in any measure a probable source of difficulty and danger to my own interests or those of Government, it is proper for me to com municate my apprehensions for their august views. But in view of your explanations and letter under reply, I can but bow to their view and authorise Your Honour to say that I shall rely on the Great Government to support me so long as I am firm in faithful fulfilment of my engagements with them,as in the past; please God I shall preserve those obligations and in crease my intimate attachment to the Great Government and shall act up to what is written in our Treaties and even more than that. I would only represent to you that among the stipulations in our Treaties and in the agreement regarding the lease of land at Bandar Shweikh, my 'sons' are specified as my suc cessors, while now in the condition as arranged between the 2 Governments, the word ’’Khalaf' appears. Now 'Khalaf' (suc cessors) includes sons and others . Again in our Treaties I am described as not agreeing to the presence in Kuwait of t \ * 4the subjects of any foreign Government, especially the Tur kish Government. These are twp points in our treaties and further in the documentary agreement between yourselves and me in re gard to the lease of land at Shweikh, I stipulated that the right of levying Customs duty on your subjects and others belonged to me, and on this understanding the agreement was reached, and I have the deed and you also have a duplicate. I have explained to you these 3 points, please give them your high consideration. And whatever was included in the Treaty was with the concurrence of both parties and the agreement regarding the lease of land at Shweikh was also concluded with the concurrence of both parties. I beg to refer this to Tour Honour's consideration, and attention, and the decision rests with you.

(L.S.) Sabah bin Jaber.No. 3359, dated Bushire, the 9th (received 17th) November 1913 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colon*!, Sie P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to revert to the question of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s desire for a dynastic guarantee, last referred to in the Government of India s telegram of 9th August to His Majesty’s Secretary of State. Since our interview in the Shatt-el-Arab on 7th July, and the despatch of my letter No. 2102 of 10th idem to Government, Shaikh Mubarak has repeat- edly asked the Political Agent whether there was any reply from Government on this point, and at my recent visit he reverted to the subject of the Conven tion generally and the question of succession in particular. 2 . I was glad to find that he had quite reconciled himself to the presence of the Turkish Agent and agreed with us that the chances were that he would generally he able to keep the Agent in his pockSt, as Shaikh Khazal does the Persian Karguzar; while if the Agent gave trouble, he would be able to get rid of him with our assistance. As regards the Customs contingency too, he realised that it was remote at present, and that relying on our co-operation when the time came, he would not concern himself about it meanwhile. In the matter of the reception of foreigners, e.g., Messrs. Wonckhaus, he readily accepted our view and would admit none except under our advice. 3 . He then turned to the question of the succession, and asked me what Government had said on that point. I replied that they had apparently not found it possible to give me any special reply or instructions. I went on to explain to him that His Majesty’s Government naturally had to be very chary of committing themselves to guarantees of this sort for all time and without conditions to safeguard them in certain eventualities, and that in his case, seeing that the Turks had agreed, in the present Convention, to abstain from all interference in the question of succession, it was consequently simplv a matter concerning himself and us, and I did not quite see what reason he had to be anxious about it. Thinking it a pity to lose the opportunity of gettin 0, at his real feelings, I continued that Captain Shakespear and I would, as he knew, shortly be going home on leave, and that we three might not have another opportunity of a quiet talk together, so could he not, now that^ we were on the subject, confide to us what he really had in mind so that we might understand the position exactly and be in a position to make any further explanation to Governmeut that might be indicated. He readily responded. He said he quite understood the difficulty of His Majesty’s Government in such questions and did not want to nominate anybody now as his presumptive successor, nor did he press for anything in writing ; but that what exercised him was’the thought, or the fear, that when the time came for him to go,- some individual or individuals from among his family or kinsmen, who found themselves disappointed, might engineer active discord which if we held aloof, mio’ht rack the principality and undo his lifework as Shaikh m the direction of ^consolidation and improvement. What he so much wanted was to be able, to feel assured that when he joined the majority, provided that we had no reason to differ from his wishes at the time, or his testamentary dispositions if he went suddenly, we would, in case of necessity, stand by, and even intervene to regulate the situation. We told him that we quite appreciated his point of view and would place it fully before Government for sympathetic consideration. 4 . I venture to think tliat it would not be difficult to find a formula that would*set the mind of our venerable protege at rest, and I much hope that Government will see their way to devise one which will have that effect with out inconveniently committing themselves.* &gt; L II?

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 341-E.B, dated 24th January 1906, regarding a compila tion of treaties between the British Government and the Trucial Chiefs. The custom inaugurated in 1904, of handing to each Chief, on his acces sion, a copy of the principal Treaties by which his predecessors were bound, coupled with an invitation to him to notify un reservedly his acceptance of them and other obligations attaching to him in practice, apart from formal conventions, has been found to be convenient and useful, and has led to a suggestion that a similar, but confidential, publication, covering the English and Arabic versions of all treaties and undertakings of importance between the British Government and the other Bulers on the Arab Coast with whom we are in Treaty relations, would prove of similar use and value. 2. I have therefore under compilation, with the assistance of the Political Agents concerned, a collection of such documents, both in the original Arabic and in English, and have the honour to submit the collection regarding Kuwait herewith. I hope to be in a position to submit the Maskat and Bahrain collections shortly, together with copies of certain further documents relating to the Trucial Coast, which it is convenient to have on record in the original Arabic, though it does not seem necessary or desirable at present to furnish the Chiefs with copies. 3. The agreement entered into by the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1841 to maintain the Maritime Truce for a period of one year, which forms the first item in the present collection, has not been brought to the notice of Govern ment before, as far as I am aware, and no translation of it is to be founa in Aitchison. I myself was not aware of its existence until a few days ago, when it came to light whilst the originals of other old treaties were being looked for. 4. I venture to suggest, for the consideration of Government, that the collection now enclosed be suitably printed, in English and Arabic, each document or set of documents on separate pages, English and Arabic separate , and would ask that this Besidency may be favoured with 30 copies of the collection, for purposes of record. It would be convenient if 5 copies could be supplied suitably bound, the remainder in loose sets. This arrangement will make it possible to furnish a Chief on his accession, or at other times, without inconvenience or delay, on receipt of orders from , . p. . Government, with copies of the Treaties Sut and other undertakings by which he is ruos. bound and which it may be considered expedient to communicate to him as was done at Bahrain at the request of the Shaikh himself in 1905. Apart from this, it is convenient to have on record, in an accessible and authoritative form, the text of these treaties, some of the originals of which are of old date and too fragile to be handled oftener than is absolutely necessary.7~\ , . ^ 0 From No ottof 1915. j Folluioal Agenoy,, &gt; Kuwait,.

He said that last year the Chaikh of Bahrain, had refused a generous offer from the Govt, of India respecting the management of his customs owing to want, of con- -fidenoe, and that a lead from Kuwait would doubtless set. that, rig-it- I replied -Ghat the plan was a, very excellent, one, which when carried cut would increase the satisfaction already felt by His Majesty's Govt, at.

Would he simply borrow British officials and pay them from the Revenue, the Political Agent having no connection with the business, and the proceeds, whatever they are, going to the Shaikht or would he want us to make a bid for his Customs and run them for ourselves? or would he want us to run them under the Political Agent’s supervision and simply pay in to him the nett proceeds?

I have the honour to report that Sir Mubarak uo Subah, Shaikli of Kuwait, desires me to submit the following for the wise consideration of the Government of India. 2. He recent made a suggestion to the Political Agent, Kuwait, that he was prepared to hand over his Customs to Government at the conclusion of*the war as a proof of his confidence in ua, e.g. the Sultan of Masqat and the Shaikh of Bahrain. On receiving the report from Colonel Grey, I asked for further details on certain points, before placing the matter before Government; meanwhile the Shaikh arrived in the River on a . N visit to the Shaikh of Muhammareh, and came up to see me. At a long interview he expressed himself as follows:- He has arrived at a great age and cannot hope to live for many years more; his affairs and the material development of Kuwait have greatly prospered during the last few years, ow ing to the support given him by the British Government; he has several sons and relations, some harmless, some danger ous; it is his very earnest wish that the edifice which he has taken so much paino to build up may not be rent into fragments by a family scramble for the patrimony on his demise. He has devised the following Scheme of insurance against such a calamity. He wantGovernment to farm from him or manage fbr him, now and in future, all sources of revenue, and simply pay him the income. Ho can then in his Will leave his various beneficiaries their inheritance in the form of specific sums payable to them by Government from Revenue. It „/S'S It io an Ingenious and wise Scheme worthy of his fine old character, and I very nach hope that, in view of his unwavering friendship with us and his strong and progreosi- rule, tho Government of India will vouchsafe a response wh: will not disappoint him. It is difficult to go into matters in detail with him un til Government have expressed their willingness in prineipl to find a basis for meeting his wishes, and I therefore beg that the Government of India will be pleaded to inthnate to me their reply cn this point as soon as practicable* Copy t- 0*3.d.

The Shaikh died at about .15, p.». on Uie • 5th November. He had been suffering from malarial fever for several days but was much better on the 28th oming and transacted indoor business aa usual. His condition was maintained throughout the day, but after the evening meal he fell asleep on a couch before retiring for the night and died quite suddenly from heart failure when -in attendant awakened him. 3. Shaikh Jabir on being informed of his father* a death at about 0 p.su, sent over a secretary, Muharuaad bin Khamls, to beg in his name for the protection of H.M. * a Government on succeeding to the Shaikhdom as his father’s heir apparent and nominee, and to assure me that his fidelity to us and regard for our wishes would exceed even those of his father, I replied that H.M.’s Government were aware that the late Shaikh had desired that Shaikh Jabir should succeed him, aid that he might be assured of their support on the understanding given, adding that I would refer his request officially to you. As I'.uh&amp;piaiaG bin Khamls appeared to be in a state of sesu? '* L© i?2 trepidation I asked him whether Ja'oir had tiny fear of oppo* sition to his succession and he replied in the negative; but, in view of the general oi inion In Kuwait that there might be trouble from Sir Mubarak's second son Salim and his friends, X thought it best to Include In my telegram a request for the presence of one of Hie Majesty's ships for a few days until Shaikh J&amp;bir had consolidated his position. Shaikh Salim, ?eiO was out fighting the Ajman tribe as already reported, has not yet returned to Kuwait, and meanwhile Jablr, with the help of Sir Khasal Khan and myself, has taken up the position of ruler. It is now thought that Salim will, however unwillingly, reepg- nlse his brother as Shaikh on return, any opportunity he nay have had for raising opposition having passed, nd at the time of writing all is iuiet. Salim is expected to arrive In Kuwait any day, and a further report will be submitted in due course. 4, A copy of tills letter is being sent to Basrah.

Lt-Colonel W.O.Grey, I.A. Political Agent, Kuwait. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, &amp;.inhi.r.fe. Dated Kuwait, December 23nd, 1915. Sir, I have the honour to report the following incident for information in connection with the attitude of Shaikh Jabir towards His Majesty’s Govt. 2. I recently received from the Deputy Resident in Bushire two Persian letters written by one Ali Muhammad niza mwazi, a Persian subject who has resided in Kuwait for some Twelve years, which had been stopped by the Censor. The letters contained passages giving the usuai. Kuwait gossip regarding British reverses in Irac, and a dismal view of our yrosMects elsewhere, with references to the death of Shaikh Sir Mubarak and the probability of disturbances in connection with the succession as Shaikh Jabir was our nominee whereas the people preferred Shaikh Salim. 3. At a personal interview on the 14th inst. I mentioned the matter to Shaikh Jabir, without however informing him that the man had remarked in his letters upon Sir Mubarak &amp; death and possible complications and the Shaikh at once send for Ali Muhammad. He arrived after X had left the palace, but it appears that Shaikh Jabir first boxed his ears and then struck him a few blows with a sandal, no stick being handy, saying at the same time that lie would not have noi English letters written from here and that All must leave *4*' his territories within five days. 4 . Early the next morning All Muhammad came to me 'begging for intercession and that he might be allowed to remain in Kuwait. I told him that I had not revealed to 3haikh Jabir that which 7 K&gt;uld have made matters much more serious for him than they were, and consented to intercede for him after ex tracting a promise that he would not write again upon the subject of the war without shewing the letter to me. Accord ingly I asked Shaikh Jabir to allow Ali Muhammad to remain in Kuwait on the understanding that he would not again offend in this manner, and hr agreed. 5. The incident has been of great value. Shaikh Jabir has displayed his attitude towards the interests of His Majesty’s Govt.; I have had the opportunity of shewing that he is pre pared to be influenced by my representations; I have Ali Muhammad 'a remarks upon the domestic situation in Kuwait hanging over his head as a perpetual threat which will ensure his good behaviour; and Ali is allowed to remain here where he will do less mischief than elsewhere In the Persian Gulf supposing that he is a deliberate mischief-maker which I think is doubtful. 6 . It may be observed that everyone here knows that letters are censored, and no secret has been divulged. ?. A copy of this.letter is being sent to Bushire.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 14th September 1915? regarding the desire of the Shaikh ofjfcoweit that the British Government should farm from him or manage for him all sources of revenue and pay him the income; 4 The question has been referred to His Majesty's Government and I am now desired to convey the following remarks. It is fully realised that th^proposal would have the advantage of crystallising our paramount position in Koweit? but while anxious to meet the Shaikh's wishes the • » Government of India foresee difficulties in accepting the proposal. With so large an undertaking the Political Agent would be quite unable himself to deal without assistance? and a large staff? including probably customs officers? revenue collectors and an accounts', of f ice ? would be necessary to carry out the scheme satisfactorily. The cost would consequently be considerable and might be regarded by the Shaikh as excessive. Further the resentment of local officials would °f' probably be aroused by loss of employment and/opportunities of securing illicit profits? and serious obstruction might result. 3. Apart from this? the Shaikh's successor might object to the continuation of/the arrangement proposed which we should presumably be bound to perpetuate in view of our pledges to Sir Mubarak~us- Subah. The position of the new Ti£fa . a ruler would certainly be politically weakened and he might be forced into a state of actual antagonism to us, V 4. The Government of India are of/opinion that while Sir Mubarkk might be given an assurance that His Majesty’s Government are anxious to meet his wishes in the matter&gt; if /iu7 VxCuo shcruA-ci f ij ypM.

As I was on the point of leaving Kut-al-Amara I received telegrams from yourself and Shaikh Khazal giving me the sad news of the death of my dear friend. Shaikh Mubarak. I sent replies to these telegrams from Amara on my way down and presume that they had reached you and Shaikh Khazal. I was greatly distressed yesterday on meeting Shaikh Khazal here to learn that neither he nor you had received them. I can only suppose that the reason was that, owing to the great congestion of military telegranh work at that moment, my telegrams were crowded out. I beg to send you herewith copies of them. You will, I know, realize what a great grief it was to me to hear of your revered father’s death, and it is no less 2 . source of sorrow to Government who had come to regard him as a trusted and firm ally and had greatly appreciated his staunch adherence to British friendship interests for many years past. I am confident that Your Honour will do all that is in your power to follow in his footsteps and to maintain and to strengthen the close relations existing between the principality of Koweit and the British Government. It was a great source of satisfaction to me to know that our friend. Shaikh Ahazal, was with your father at the time of his death and remained there to give support and consolation to yourself and the other members of his family. I have been still further gratified to learn that affairs in Koweit are in an entirely satisfactory state, and that the government is proceeding as usual, under your control, x'ou will, I know, find Colonel Grey a sympathetic adviser and, I trust, you will consult him freely in*W- - ,in vour difficulties* I hope it rcay be possible for ire to pay you a visit during the present cold weather; in the meanwhile I trust you will not cease to communicate with me when you find it convenient. Please convey ay condolences and salaams to your brother# Salim# who# I an confident# will not fail to eo“ operate with you in nursuing the oolicy so firmly maintained by your revered father in close association with the British authorities# for it is bevond doubt that it is in the pur suit of this policy that interests of Xoweit and its ruler have prospered in such a marked way under your honoured father and will I hope continue to nrosper under your own rulership.
