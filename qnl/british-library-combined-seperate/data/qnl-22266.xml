            Abdel Rahim Khan.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x000034#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
