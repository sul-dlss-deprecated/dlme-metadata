Much of the correspondence concerns the exact wording of these agreements and numerous amendments that were made to them.The majority of the correspondence in the file is between British officials (including at the Foreign Office, India Office, the British Legation in Jeddah and the Political Agency in Kuwait), but it also contains a limited amount of correspondence with Saudi Arabia's Minister in London, Shaikh Hafiz Wahba, and the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, on whose behalf the British acted during the negotiations with Saudi Arabia that led to the agreements.In addition to correspondence, the file contains several drafts of the proposed agreements between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, including a trade agreement, an agreement of 'Friendship and Bon Voisinage' and an agreement for the extradition of offenders. On folios 316-346, the file contains bilingual (English and Arabic) drafts of these agreements.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Economic sanctions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00012a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00012a#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00012a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
