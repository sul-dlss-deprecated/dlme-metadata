Each local depot shall, unless the local Government otherwise directs, / maintain a reserve stock of stamps not less than the probable consumption of five months in addition to the stock required for the quarterly or annual con-: sumption as the case may be. Local Governments may direct that the supply to be maintained either generally or in respect of any particular kind of stamp or in certain local depots, shall be equal to the probable consumption of such other period as they deem expedient. 16. If the supply of stamps in any local depot should run short before the receipt of the supply from the Central Stamp Store, the officer-in-charge of the local depot should indent for a supply from a neighbouring depot, sending a . copy of the indent to the Controller of Stamps, Nasik Road or to the officer appointed by the local Government under rule 9 (i) {b), according as the local depots may be in a central area or in a Governors’ Province. 17. Emergent indents on neighbouring depots as authorised in rule 16 may ordinarily be made on a depot in the same province or administration. If the depot is in another province or administration, the general or special orders . both of the local Government controlling the supplying depot and of the local ^ * Government controlling the indenting depot will be ne cessary. JiZ njdiL 18^ Every subordinate, branch, or tahsil treasury shall be a branch depot . for the sale of stamps of all descriptions. But in any case where the sale of stamps from such a branch depot is insignificant, and equal facilities exist for the supply of stamps from a depot in the same station as the branch depot, the local Government may direct the closing of the branch depot : provided that, without the previous sanction of the Government of India, the local Govern ment may not order that the maintenance of a stock of postage stamps in a sub- treasurv may be dispensed with even if the post office authorities do not require it. 19. The supply to be kept in a branch depot should be not less than the \ probable demand for three months ; but the Chief Controlling Revenue autho- \ rity as defined in section 2 ( 8 ) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, may direct that \ the supply shall be equal to the demand of any other period instead of three \ months which it may consider expedient. The stock should be kept up to this amount by indenting and obtaining supplies from the local depot from time to time as may be necessary. 20. As soon as the number of stamps in the branch depot not receiving its supplies direct from the Central Stamp Store, falls below the number issued from the depot in the preceding four months, the officer-in-charge of the depot shall prepare an indent for a supply equal to the probable^onsumption of two months. The indent shall show, in separate col umns for wwdi denom ination o J The quantity sold in the preceding four A* TTepot, stamns of' whidi- n supple jo roquiiW, the balance m r months and the quantity indented for, whichl should be aoproximatelv one-half of the quantity sold in the preceding four months. The periods of “ four months ” and “ two months” in this rule may he altered bv the Clu'ef Controlling Revenue authority as defined in section 2 ( 8 ) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, to such other periods as it may deem expedient. *&lt; 7/tf'4 21. Branch depots authorised to receive supplies direct from the Central Stamp Store should keep as reserve stock quantities approximating to the con sumption of three months in addition to the quarterly or annual demand. B. — Accounts, Returns, Storage, etc. 22. As soon as possible after the arrival of supply of stamps from the central store or from another local depot, the officer-in-charge of the local depot shall personally examine the outward appearance of the boxes or packets and satisfy himself that they bear no marks of tampering. He shall then have the boxes or packets opened in his presence, and the contents of each box or packet counted either by himself or in his presence, immediately on being opened. Where the treasury is the local depot, the boxes or packets should invariably be placed immediately on arrival in the strong room of the treasury and there opened, one at a time, in the presence of the treasury officer, who must be present all the time the boxes or packets are being opened and their contents examined and counted. In no case must a second box or packet be opened until the contents of the first have been completely examined and verified and placed in the proper receptacles as required by rule 25. The number and value of stamps received shall be compared by the officer-in-charge with the invoice submitted and a receipt shall be sent not later than seven days after tire arrival of the stamps to the officer who sent the stamps. 23. Local Governments may issue such orders as may be thought neces sary regarding the detailed counting of stamps received in a local depot, and as to the descriptions of stamps which the officer-in-charge himself must count. Such orders may include instructions that a certain percentage only of sealed packets marked as containing a certain number of stamps need be opened and counted at the time of receipt and the remainder, if the percentage opened are all found correct, left with seals unbroken to be counted, as they are required, on being given out from double lock. The officer-in-charge is responsible for observing any such instructions, and for satisfying himself as to the number of stamps received before signing the receipt. The inside wrappers of packets of stamps which bear the initials of the officers through whose hands the packets passed befoie issue from Central Stamp Store should invariably be preserved till the whole contents of the packets have been examined and found correct. 24. If any of the stamps received are found unfit for issue due to faulty manufacture, they should be returned at once to the Controller of Stamps, Nasik Road. The Press will not be liable to replace free of charge stamps tound unfit for issue from causes other than faulty manufacture. Stamps that are through any cause rendered unfit for issue at anv time after receipt shall be disposed of m accordance with rules 46, 47 and 52 ( 6 ) and the rules framed by a 1 rovmcial Government under rule 47 . 7 '^' immediately after the stamps received have been counted, thev shall be Placed m proper receptacles in the store under double lock in the presence ot the officer-m-charge, arranged in parcels and packets containing known quan tities, the amount and value of each denomination being entered at the same t™*™ * re f 8t % maintained to show the receipts, and issues to and from the Core under double lock These entries shall be checked by the officer-in-charge at the hme when the stamps are deposited, and the correctness of the arith metical calculations of additions to balance, as well as of the values compared khflil 8 h j U ^ vmfied and initialled by him at the time.

Note. —The officers in charge of such local depots, in the Bombay Presidency as have no hazur treasurers, may issue postage stamps from the double lock store for sale to the public or post offices. Direct issues of postage stamps from the double lock store are also allowed in the case of local depots in the Lushai and Naga Hills, Manipur and Tura and the branch depots at frindiym JowtH-and Hnflong Awn am. rl+nUAjvy 27. The stock to be made over to t]fe ex-officio vendor to be kept oy him under single lock should ordinarily be sufficient for the probable demand of one month. The ex-officio vendor will maintain a register of receipts into and issues from single lock in the same form as the double lock register, and on a fixed date near the beginning of each month he will prepare an indent for the quantity required for the month in a form showing the balances in his hands, an average month’s consumption and the quantity required. When this indent is presented to the officer-in-charge, he will examine the single lock register and check the correctness of the arithmetical calculations made therein. If he approves the indent, he shall then give out the quantity required from the store under double lock, check the correctness of the entries made in the double lock register, see that they correspond with those made in the single lock register, initial both registers and return the double lock register into the double lock store. The same procedure should ordinarily be followed when stamps are issued from double lock at any intermediate date, but when it is necessary to make issues more than once in one day, the prescribed checks need be applied at each time of issue only to the particular descriptions of stamps given out from double lock. There shall be a bi-monthly verification of the balance of stamps in the hands of the ex-officio vendor unless the local Government desires that such verification should be more frequent in local depot of the province or area concerned, e.g., on every day on which stamps are issued to the stamp vendor from double locks. Note. —Local Goveniinents may reduce the period of one month mentioned in this rule to one week, or any other period less than, a month, if they consider this desirable with reference to the amount of the treasurer’s security or for any other reason. 28. From the stock so made over to his charge and kept by him under single lock the ex-officio vendor shall sell stamps to the public and to licensed vendors for cash. He shall maintain the single lock register in the form men tioned in the preceding paragraph in such language as the local Government may direct, entering therein both in quantities and values the receipt from double lock, the daily sales and the balance in his hands of each denomination at the end of each day. He shall pay daily into the treasury the cash received by him for stamps sold, the amount realised on account of each of the three descriptions of stamps—namely, general, court-fees and, postage—being paid in separately. The account of the daily sales should be inspected and the correctness of the calculations shown therein checked every day by the officer in charge of the depot. 29. A district officer may direct that the sales to the public of judicial and non-judicial stamps by ex-officio vendors shall be limited to stamps of a value higher than a named amount, the sale to the public of stamps of lower value being left to licensed vendors. 30. The sub-treasurer, or such other officer as the district officer may direct, shall be the ex-officio vendor of stamps at a branch depot. 31. The officer-in-charge of the branch depot shall obtain his supplies from the local depot to which the branch depot is subordinate, in the same manner as the ex-officio vendor at the local depot obtains his supplies, except that the indent and the stamps must be sent by post or messenger to and from the local depot, and that the examination of the balance in hand and the comparison of the amounts shown with those shown in the indent shall be done bv the officer- in-charge of the branch depot. In case where there is likelv to be distinct saving of cost or greater security of the stamps in transmit, the local Govern ment may empower the Board of Revenue or other superior revenue authority to sanction, subject to timely notice of such sanction being given to the Con troller of Stamps, the despatch of stamps direct from the Central Stamp Store to a branch depot, such supplies being passed through the accounts of the local depot and treated by the Controller of Stamps, as supplies to the local depot to which the branch depot is subordinate- The receipt and examination of stamps on arrival from the Central Stamp Store or a local depot should be conducted in the manner laid down in Rule ^ L157CBRExcept where the officer-in-charge of the branch depot has been appointed ex-officio vendor, the ex-officio vendor shall obtain his supplies from the officer- in-charge of the branch depot in the same manner as the ex-officio vendor at the local depot obtains his supplies from the officer-in-charge. 32. (i) Where the officer-in-charge of the branch depot has been appointed ex-officio vendor, sales to the public or to licensed vendors may be made direct from the double lock, and the register of receipts into^ and issues from single lock prescribed in rule 27 of these rules need not be maintained. (it) In all other cases, local Governments shall fix the period, a supply for which shall be kept under single lock by the ex-officio vendor, and the remainder of the stamps in the branch depot shall be kept under double lock of the officer- in-charge of the branch depot and of the ex-officio vendor, and given our to single lock as required. 33. Except as provided in the foregoing rule, sales from branch depots will be made subject to the same rules as those from local depots. 34.

The rules regulating the grant of discount and the grant of licenses to licensed vendors for the sale of judicial and non-judicial stamps vary in different provinces, and are prescribed by local Governments.C .—Postage Stamps. 39. In addition to the foregoing rules, the following rules will apply to postage stamps. These rules will apply both in the Governors’ Provinces and centrally administered areas. 40. Service stamps shall be sold by local depots to Government officials and semi-official bodies and institutions mentioned in clause 354 of the Post and Telegraph Guide who will be required to certify in writing that the stamps will be used on prepaying postage on communications bona fide on the service of His Majesty or for the purposes stipulated in the said clause of the Post and Tele graph Guide. Note 1.—Service postage stamps may also be sold to the public, provided that the value of the stamps sold to any person at one time shall not be less than ten shillings or Rs. 6-8-0 and that an extra charge of half per cent, in the rupee calculated on the face value shall be made to cover in cidental expenses. Note 2.—For rules regulating sales to Government officials see Articles 98 and 429 of the Civil Account Code. Note 3. —Government officials authorized to obtain Service postage stamps from local depots, may exchange such stamps either for service stamps of different denominations, or with the previous approval of the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, for ordinary postage stamps provided that the stamps returned to the local depots are in a serviceable condition. 41. Ordinary postage stamps, shall be sold for cash from local depots to officers-in-charge of post offices, at which letters are received for despatch, to persons licensed to sell general stamps under the rules framed under the Indian Stamps Act, 1899 (II of 1899), and to the public provided that the value sold to any person at one time shall not be less than Rupees 5, and shall not include any fraction of a rupee, and that embossed envelopes and post cards shall be sold in complete packets only.

Note 2.—Except on the special authority of the Government of India or the Director General, Posts and Telegraphs, no free supplies of ordinary postage stamps and stationery shall be made by the Controller of Stamps, Nasik. Under a special arrangement sanctioned by the Government of India, the Accountant General, Jammu and Kashmir State, holds an imprest of ordinary postage stamps of the face value of Rs. 1,50,000 for supply on payment to the Imperial Post Offices located in tihe Kashmir State territory. This imprest is recouped by him by indents on the Sialkot and Rawalpindi Government treasuries, the supplies being adjusted by book transfer through the treasury accounts. The treasuries should separately show in their plus and minus memoranda the issues to the Accountant General, Jammu and Kashmir State. Debits for the face value of stamps should be raised in the treasury accounts against the State as soon as stamps are issued from the treasuries on receipt of indents in the proper form and the fact should be noted on the indent by the Treasury Officer concerned. A duplicate copy of the indent showing the supplies actually made should be furnished by the Treasury Officer concerned to the/Accountant General, Posts and Tele- ^ graphs to enable him to verify the credits afforded by the Accountant General, Punjab. 12.

No discount is allowed to Heads of Departmental Telegraph offices for the sales' of stamps ; but they are allowed permanent advances of ordinary postage stamps without pavment, the amount of the permanent advance being fixed by the Heads of Postal Circles and Superintendents of Telegraph Offices, the latter up to a limit of Rs. 500. When the permanent advance of ordinary postage stamps has once been taken, subsequent issues to Heads of Depart mental Telegraph offices are made only on cash payment. But when the local depot is about to be closed for holidays of more than one day’s duration, officers-in-charge of local depots are authorized to issue ordinary postage stamps to Heads of Departmental Telegraph offices without payment in excess o1 the value of the permanent advance, these temporary advances being adjusted when the treasury re-opens by the return of the stamps, or the payment of their value if sold. 43. The officer-ln-charge of each post office, at which letters are received for despatch, and of each telegraph office, is required to keep a supply of ordi nary postage stamps for sale to the public sufficient for the probable demands of one week. 44 Superintendents and Inspectors of post offices within their respective jurisdictions and any other officers of the post office authorised on that behalf/ 8 Su. /.

Stamp indents for the January-March 1937 quarter will be complied with before the 24th December 1936 and heavy consignments despatched by goods train as usual. As treasuries maintain reserve stocks, normally there should be no necessity for urgent supplies.

The mode of despatch, whether by goods or passenger train or by post, should be clearly specified in the emergent indents. W V D.

Stocks of one-anna revenue stamps of the old issue in the Central Stamp Store are being depleted in view of the forthcoming 1937 issue which will be available for supply early in January 1937. Against the quantities demanded in the indents for the January-March 1937 quarter, it is proposed to send at present part supplies only of the old issue if demands are heavy and the balance due in January 1937. 2 . It should be specially noted that preference should be given to the sale of one-anna revenue stamps of the old issue with a view to exhaust them before stamps of the 1937 issue are taken up for sale. The words “1937 Issue” will either be printed or written on the labels pasted on the packets containing these stamps. Whenever they are opened for verification, they must be repacked and labelled 1937 Issue ” so that they may not get mixed up with stamps of the old issue, the difference between the stamps not being readily discernible.

Every treasury including those attached to political and salt agencies shall be a local depot for the custody and sale of stamps of all descriptions. Provincial Governments and local Administrations may establish local depots at places where there is no treasury. Provided that match excise banderols shall be stocked at the local and branch depots selected by the Provincial Governments and local Administra tions for the purpose. 14. Each local depot shall, unless the Provincial Government otherwise directs maintain a reserve stock of stamps not less than the probable consump tion of three months m the case of postage stamps and match excise banderols and four months m the case of non-postal stamps in addition to the stock re quired for the quarterly or four-monthly or annual consumption as the case uSVr?' -ih he Prov T ial ( ? overimien ts may direct that the supply to be main tained either generally or m respect of any particular kind of stamp or in cer- as tlieTdeemtxpediint 6 Cq ” !,I t0 ^ Pr ° hablC COnS,,mption of such other P^od •1'!'

As soon as the number of stamps in the branch depot not receiving its supplies dnect trom the Central Stamp Store falls below the number issued Corn the depot m the preceding four months, the officer in charge of the depot shaJl piopaie an indent lor a supply equal to the probable consumption of two months.. 1 he indent shall show, in separate columns for all denominations oi stamps, whether a supply is required or not, the balance in the branch depot, the quantity sold in the preceding four months and the quantity indented for, which should be approximately one-halt of the quantity sold in the preceding four months. The periods of “ four months ” and “ two months ” in this rule may be altered by the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority appointed by com petent authority for the purposes of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, to such other periods as it may deem expedient. 20. Branch depots authorized to receive supplies direct from the Central Stamp Store should keep as reserve stock quantities approximating to the consumption of three months in the case of postage stamps and match excise banderols and four months in the case of non-postal stamps in addition to the quarterly or four-monthly or annual demand. B.— Accounts, Returns, Storage, etc. 21 . As soon as possible after the arrival of supply of stamps from the Central Stamp Store or from another local depot, the officer in charge of the local depot shall personally examine the outward appt&amp;raiw* «f the boxes or packets and satisfy himself that they bear no marks of tampering. He shall then have the boxes or packets opened in his presence, and the contents of each box or packet counted either by himself or in his presence, immediately on being opened in accordance with rule 22 . Where the treasury is the local depot, the boxes or packets should invariably be placed immediately on arrival in ’ the strong room of the treasury and there opened, one at a time, in the presence of the treasury officer, who must be watching all the time the boxes or packets are being opened and their contents examined and counted. In no case must a second box or packet be opened until the contents of the first have been com pletely examined and verified and placed in the proper receptacles as required by rule 26. The number and value of stamps received shall be compared by the officer in charge with the invoice submitted and a receipt shall be sent to the officer who sent the stamps as soon as may be convenient and in no case later than fifteen days after the arrival of the stamps. 22 . The Provincial Governments and local Administrations may issue such orders as may be thought necessary regarding the detailed counting of stamps received in a local depot, and as to the descriptions of stamps which the officer in charge himself must count. Such orders may include instructions that a certain percentage only of each denomination of sealed packets marked as con taining a certain number of stamps need be opened and counted at the time of receipt and the remainder, if the percentage opened are all found correct, left with seals unbroken to be counted, as they are required, on being given out from double lock. The officer in charge is responsible for observing anv such instructions, and for satisfying himself as to the number of stamps received before signing the receipt. Thereafter, he shall be deemed to have taken over, on behalf of the Government or Department whose source of revenue the stamps are, full responsibility for the correctness and custody of the quantities received and the consignor shall be exonerated from liability in respect of any discrepancy noticed subsequent to the taking over of the stamps and the return of the receipt unless it is conclusively proved to the satisfaction of the Govern ment of India in the Finance Department (Central Revenues) that the dis crepancy occurred prior to the despatch of stamps from the Central Stamp Store and that notwithstanding the strict observance of the rules and orders on the subject the discrepancy could not be detected at the time of taking over. Any such discrepancy should be immediately reported by the officer in charge both to his administrative head and to the Controller of Stamps for investigation. The inside wrappers (all complete) of packets of stamps which bear the initials of the officers through whose hands the packets passed before issue from the Central Stamp Store should invariably be preserved till the vffiole contents of the packets have been examined and found correct. 23. In respect of supplies of non-postal stamps (other than match excise banderols) the Controller of Stamps shall send an invoice in triplicate to the local depot to which supplies are sent from the Central Stamp Store, showing6 therein the denominations, the quantities, the face value, the manufacturing rate and the manufacturing value of the stamps supplied. The original copy of the invoice will be retained in the local depot and the duplicate returned to the Controller of Stamps with the acknowledgment of the officer in charge of the local depot ordinarily not later than seven days and in special cases not later than fifteen days after the receipt of the consignment of stamps. The triplicate will also be acknowledged and forwarded at the same time to the officer appointed under rule 9 (i) (b). The acknowledgment of the officer in charge of the local depot shall read as follows :— “ I certify that the stamps invoiced above have been duly checked on receipt in accordance with the rules. I have satisfied myself as to their correctness, and 1 hereby acknowledge receipt of the stamps amount ing in face value to Rs (in words).” Invoices relating to supplies to branch depots shall be returned to the Controller and to the officer appointed under rule 9 (i) (b) through the officer in charge of the local depot concerned who shall countersign them. A consolidated bill in quadruplicate shall be sent by the Controller of Stamps to the officer appointed under rule 9 (i) (b) by the 10 th of each month showing therein the total manufacturing cost of all non- postal stamps despatched during the previous month together with spare copies of all relative invoices and a summarised statement showing the amount of each invoice. On receipt of the relative acknowledged copies of invoices from the local depots, the officer appointed under rule 9 (i) (b) shall accept the Con troller’s bill and send the duplicate thereof to him with his acceptance of the debit and forward at the same time the triplicate and quadruplicate copies of the bill duly accepted to the Accounts Officer concerned who, in turn, shall make the requisite adjustment against the balances of the Provincial Government con cerned by credit to the Central Government, the credit being passed on to the Accountant General, Bombay, through the exchange account and shall forward a copy of the bill to the Accountant General, Bombay. It shall be incumbent on the part of the officer appointed under rule 9 (i) (b) accepting the debit to see that copies of invoices are submitted to him by the officers in charge of local depots after acceptance without delay and that the amount of the Controller’s bill is adjusted in time before the close of the financial year. Note 1 .—In the case of Bombay Province with the exception of Bombay City, the triplicate copies of invoices shall be sent by the officers in charge of local depots to the Commissioners of the Divisions concerned and not to the officer appointed under rule 9 (») (&amp;). The consolidated bills for the manufacturing cost of supplies of non-postal x stamps shall similarly be sent by the Controller of Stamps to the Commissioners of the Divisions concerned to be disposed of in accordance with the procedure laid down in the ' above rule. As regards supplies to the Superintendent of Stamps, Bombay, an invoice and a bill, in triplicate, shall be sent to him by the Controller of Stamps ; the duplicate copy of the invoice and that of the bill shall be returned by him to the Controller of Stamps after acceptance and the triplicate of the bill also accepted and forwarded by him direct to the Accountant-General, Bombay, for adjustment. Note 2 .—The procedure enunciated in rule 23 above will not apply to local depots in Central areas obtaining supplies of non-postal stamps from the Central Stamp Store ; instead the procedure laid down in rule 24 shall apply to such depots. 24. In respect of supplies of postage stamps and match excise banderols the Controller of Stamps shall send an invoice in triplicate furnishing the details referred to in rule 23 to the local depot to which supplies are sent. The original copy of the invoice will be retained in the local depot, and the duplicate and triplicate returned to the Controller of Stamps with the acknowledgment of the officer in charge of the local depot in the form stipulated in rule 23. Officers in charge of branch depots shall return the duplicate and the triplicate copies to the Controller through the officer in charge of the local depot concerned who shall countersign them. The acknowledged duplicate copies of invoices shall * be collected in the Central Stamp Store and forwarded once a month to the Accountant-General, Bombay, along with the monthly cash account of the Master, Security Printing, fndia, for the purpose of raising debit against the departments concerned. 25. If any of the stamps received are found unfit for issue due to fauitv manufacture, they should be returned at once to the Controller of Stamps, Nasik Road. The Press will not be liable to replace free of charge stamps C7 found unfit for issue from causes other than faulty manufacture. Stamps that are through any cause rendered unfit for issue at any time after receipt shall be disposed ot in accordance with rules 48, 49 and 54 (b) and the rules framed by a Provincial Government under rule 49 . 26. Immediately after the stamps received have been counted, they shall be placed in proper receptacles in the store under double lock in the presence of the officer in charge, arranged in parcels and packets containing known quantities, the amount and value of each denomination being entered at the same time in a register maintained to show the receipts and issues to and from the store under double lock. These entries shall be checked by the officer in charge at the time when the stamps are deposited, and the correctness of the arithmetical calculations of additions to balance, as well as of the values compared with quantities, shall be verified and initialled by him at the time. The register shall then be placed with the stamps in the double lock receptacles and shall not be removed therefrom, nor shall any entries be allowed to be made therein except in the presence of the officer in charge. Note.— In all cases where stamp registers have to be checked, the actual check of quantities against values is a very important one ; the correctness of the calculations of value must be tested in detail either by actual multiplication or by use of correctly pre pared tables, and this check should never be omitted. This remark applies also to such of the following rules as prescribe a check of this kind. It is not necessary that the com plete checking should be done by the officer himself. It will be sufficient if the officer personally checks 10 per cent, of the entries in each class of stamps, leaving the remaining entries in each class to be checked by a subordinate under his supervision. C.— Sales. -4^- 27. The treasurer, or such other officer as the district/officer may direct, shall be the ex-officio vendor of all descriptions of stamps/in each local depot. Except as provided in the note below or in rule 33, sales to A public or to licensed vendors shall not be made direct from the stores under double lock, such sales being made by the ex-officio vendor from the supply entrusted to him for this purpose, to be kept by him under single lock, as prescribed in the following rules. Note.— The officers in charge of such local depots, in the Provinces of Bombay and Sind, as have no hazur treasurers, may issue postage stamps from the double lock store for sale to the public or post offices. Direct issues of postage stamps from the double lock store are also allowed in the case of local depots in the Lushai and Naga Hills, Manipur and Tura and the branch depots at Lungleh. Mokokchung, Sadiya, Jowai and Haflong in Assam. 28. The stock to be made over to the ex-officio vendor to be kept by him under single lock should ordinarily.be sufficient for the probable demand ot one month. The ex-officio vendor will maintain a register of receipts into and issues from single lock in the same form as the double lock register, and on a fixed date near the beginning of each month he will prepaffe an indent for the quantity required for the month in a torin showing the balances in his hands, an average month’s consumption and the quantity required. When this indent is presented to the officer in charge, he will examine the single lock register and check the correctness of the arithmetical calculations made therein. If he approves the indent, he shall then give out the quantity required from the store under double lock, check the correctness of the entries made in the double lock register, see that they correspond with those made in the single lock register, initial both registers and return the double lock register into the double lock store. The same procedure should ordinarily b 0 followed when stamps are issued from double lock at anv intermediate date, but when it is necessary to make issues more than once in one day, the prescribed checks need be applied at each time of issue onlv to the particular descriptions of stamps given out from double lock. There shall be a fortnightly verification of the balance of stamps in the hands of the ex-officio vendor unless the Provincial Government or local Administration desires that such verification should be more frequent in the local depot of the province or area concerned, e.n., on every day on which stamps are issued to the stamp vendor from double locks. Note— The Provincial Governments and local Administrations may reduce the period of one month mentioned in this rule to one week, or any other period less than a month, if they consider this desirable with reference to the amount of the treasurer’s security or for any other reason.8 29. From the stock so made over to his charge and kept by him under single lock the ex-officio vendor shall sell stamps to the public and to licensed vendors for cash. He shall maintain the single lock register in the form mentioned in the preceding paragraph in such language as the Provincial Government or local Administration may direct, entering therein both in quantities and values the receipt from double lock, the daily sales and the balance in liis hands of eaeb denomination at the end of each day. Ho shall pay daily into the treasury the cash received by him for stamps sold, Hie amount realized on account of each of the five descriptions of stamps—namely, non-judicial, court-fee, postage, match excise banderols, India, and match excise banderols, Burma -being paid in separately. The account of the daily sales should be inspected and the correct ness of the calculations shown therein cheeked every day by the officer in charge* of the depot. Note. —This rule shall remain in force at the local and branch depots to 'which the Provincial Government or local Administration concerned do not extend the provisions of rule 29 -A. 29-A. From the stock so made over to his charge and kept by him under single lock, the ex-officio vendor shall sell stamps to the public and to licensed vendors for cash. Challans, separately for each class, i.e., non-judicial, court- fee and postage stamps and match excise banderols, will be presented by the purchaser to the Accountant, who shall check the correctness of the particulars thereof, especially the discount claimed and note in a simple register the amount of the challan and the name of the purchaser. The challans, after check by the Accountant, should be presented with cash to the ex-officio vendor for the issue of stamps. Post Office requisitions for postage stamps shall be presented first to the Accountant who shall check and note them in the register of challans and then to the cx-officio vendor along with cash for the issue of stamps. The ex-officio vendor shall enter the sales chronologicallv in his single lock register Avhich shall be maintained in such language as the Provincial Govern ment or local Administration may direct, the receipts from the double lock and the daily sales, both quantities and values being entered therein and the balance in hand of different denominations of stamps being struck at the end of each day. The register should be inspected and the correctness of entries made_ therein checked every day by the officer in charge of the depot who should initial the register in token of having exercised this check. The ex-officio vendor shall return the challans and post office requisitions to the Accountant daily who shall prepare the daily accounts on their basis. Through the register of challans, the Accountant will watch the return of all challans and requisitions and bring any omission or discrepancy to the notice of the officer in charge of the depot. Note 1 .—In places where there is a branch of the Imperial Bank of India doing Gov ernment business the challans and post office requisitions shall be presented in duplicate, the extra copy being required by the Bank for making up its daily account. Note 2 .—Treasuries banking with a branch of the Imperial Bank of India maintain a register of challans prescribed in Article 322 of the Civil Account Code, Vol. II. The same register may be used for noting the challans and requisitions for stamps. 30. A district officer may direct that the sales to the public of judicial and non-judicial stamps by ex-officio vendors shall be limited to stamps of a value higher than a named amount, the sale to the public of stamps of lower value being left to licensed vendors. 31. The sub-treasurer, or such other officer as the district officer may direct, shall be the ex-officio vendor of stamps at a branch depot. 32. ri he officer in charge of the branch depot shall obtain his supplies from the local depot to which the branch depot is subordinate, in the same manner as the ex-officio vendor at the local depot obtains his supplies, except that the indent and the stamps must be sent by post or messenger to and from the local depot, and that the examination of the balance in hand and the comparison of the amounts shown with those shown in the indent shall be done by the officer in charge of the branch depot. In case where there is likely to be distinct saving of cost or greater security of the stamps in transit, the Provincial Government cr local Administration may empower the Board of Revenue or other superior revenue authority to sanction, subject to timely notice of such sanction being given to the Controller of Stamps, the despatch of stamps direct from the9 Central Stamp Store to a branch depot, such supplies being passed through the accoun s of the local depot and treated by the Controller of Stamps, as supplies o ‘ ; k e meal depot to which the branch depot is subordinate.

C.S.S. 7A. 1C.S.S. CIRCULAR No. 114 Central Stamp Store, ^ Nasik Road. 4th January, 1945. Subject: - Procedure regarding taking delivery of Stamp Cases. Pahr^i'n Receipt^ ^ate Z. Owing to several reports of abnormal delays in transit of consignments despatched from this Store by goods, passenger and mail trams and also reports of shortages of postal stationery on account of pilferage in transit, treasury and sub-treasury Officers receiving direct supplies from this Store should observe the following instructions. 1. The railway receipt relating to stamp consignments should be kept in safe custody by the Treasury Officer and should be handed over by him duly endorsed to a responsible treasury official (a member of the superior staff and not to a peon) for taking delivery of the stamp cases from the Railway Station. A case has occurred recently of a valuable consignment of stamps being stolen owing to the railway receipt being allowed to get into the hands of an unauthorised person. 2. Immediately on arrival of stamp cases at the Station the Treasury Official should check the address stencilled on the cases and see if they are addressed to the treasury concerned as, of late, it has been reported that crises which relate to other treasuries &lt;ire mis-'Ccirriecl and mis-delivered by railway officials and also taken over by treasury officials, thus resulting in unnecessary correspondence and inconvenience to all ioncerned. The treasury official should then examine the outward condition of the boxes with a view to seeing if there are any signs of tampering in transit, and after satisfying himself that the boxes are received in good condition, they should then be taken to the treasury under Police escort or under the supervision of a responsible treasury official in accordance with the orders and instructions issued by the Provincial Government concerned. The intact condition of the steel bands should be particularly examined and scrutinised to see if the steel strapping is cut anywhere and re-nailed but leaving the signode seals bearing the monogram ‘CSS’ untouched - an indication of skilful tampering. 3. Each case should be weighed separately and its weight checked with that noted in the list of weights attached to the invoice sent from this office. If any case is received in a broken condition or if it shows any signs of tampering, open delivery should be taken in the presence of the Railway Police and Railway Authorities. If any shortage in the consignment is detected, a qualified acceptance should be given to the railway and the matter should be reported to the Railway Police for investigation and the result of the Police investigation watched. A report should be sent to the Controller of Stamps, Nasik Road, immediately in accordance with rules 51 and 52 of the Rules for the Supply and Distribution of Stamps and on completion of the police investigation the final result should also be intimated. 4. Of late some treasury officers reported that parcels of postcards containing 960 postcards, or an appreciable portion thereof were found missing from cases, and at the same time had stated that the cases in which the parcels were received showed no signs of tampering. They therefore concluded that this shortage was due to short packing. Owing to the system of checks and counterchecks in force in this Department and also the system of search of the men employed here, such short packing is practically impossible. On an examination of the wrappers of these parcels it was found from the folds of the wrappers that they had originally contained the full quantity, and consequently pilferage must have occurred subsequent to packing. Such shortages must have been due to very skilful tampering and pilferage in transit. Hence cases should be carefully and closely examined by a responsible txeasuty official and weighed before taking delivery from the railway. Extraction of a small quantity say 2 or 3 small packets or a few sheets of stamps might not however show appreciable difference in the weight of the case, owing to differences in scales, and moisture content. It is essential that the whole wrapper of the packet in which a shortage is detected should be sent all complete (and not merely the packet labels) to the Controller of stamps for inspection, and the box should be preserved pending investigation. 5. If the consignments of stamps despatched by mail and passenger trains from this Store are not received within a fortnight from the date of despatch of the consignment from Nasik Road, the matter should be reported to the Station Master of the destination Station and also to the Chief Traffic Manager or Chief Commercial Manager of the destination Railway and a copy of the report should be sent to the Controller of Stamps, Nasik Road. If consignments despatched by goods train are delayed by more than two months, similar action should be taken. 6. If stamps despatched by parcel post are delayed for more than two weeks, the matter should be reported to the Superintendent of Post Offices of the area and a copy should be sent to this office. 7. If the cases or parcels of stamps the non-receipt of which is reported are received subsequently, the fact should be intimated by the treasury officer or sub-treasury officer to the Controller of Stamps, Nasik Road, and to the Railway offices concerned. 8. Invoices relating to supplies of stamps should be returned to this office after correctly acknowledging the face value of stamps as laid down in the Rules for the Supply and Distribution of Stamps, as soon as may be convenient and in no case later than fifteen days after the receipt of the consignment of stamps. It is essential that this be observed strictly asPotherwise this office will not be in a position to know within a reasonable time if the consignments despatched are correctly received by the consignee or not.
