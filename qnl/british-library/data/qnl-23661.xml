Lo m 'Explanatory Note. The rules now published are merely a reproduction of the rules previously existing (corrected up to the end of March 1926) except that rules 18 and 19 as they appeared in the published edition of the rules, corrected up to the end of July 1919, are now shown as rules 11 and 12, and the old rules from rule 11 onwards have been renumbered as rule 13, 14, etc. With the passing of the Government of India Act, the rules of the General Provident Fund became, under section 96B (4), Statutory Rules, and some verbal alterations have been made in these rules in order to give them a form more appropriate to Statu tory Rules. The rules are being recast and will shortly be issued as Statutory Rules when the rules now published will be repealed.RULES REGULATING THE GENERAL PROVIDENT FUND. {Corrected up to the end of March 1926.)

Rate of interest. 6. Compound interest at 4 per cent, shall be allowed on subscriptions; but this rate may be reduced at any time for officers who become subscribers to the Fund after Government have announced their intention of reducing therate. The rate of interest has, however, with effect from the 1st April 1919, been raised to 5J per cent. It will not operate for any definite period but shall be subject to re consideration should the rates at which the Government of India borrow money in the open market undergo modi-^, fication. Six months' notice shall be given to subscribers before any alteration is made. Provided that Mohammedan subscribers, who have joined, or may join, the Fund on the understanding that their deposits will carry no interest shall not be given in terest, but if they subsequently ask for interest it shall be given with effect from the 1st April of the financial year in which such request is made. X ote 1.—In calculating and crediting interest on the deposits of subscribers, pies shall be omitted. The calculation shall be made to the nearest anna, that is to say, six pies and above shall be treated as one anna, and amounts less than six pies shall be neglected. Note 2. —Before the amount at an officer's credit in the Fund is finally paid under rules 10, 11 or 17, his account shall be credited with interest up to the end of the month preceding that in which the payment is made, or up to the end of the sixth month after the end of the month in which he quitted the service or died, which ever of these periods is less. If a subscriber holding a temporary post exercises, on the termination of his appointment, the option allowed by rule 10 of leaving in the Fund the amount accumulated to his credit, interest shall be allowed on that amount for not more than a year after the termination of employment. If the subscriber subsequently obtains re-employment under Government, deposits not withdrawn will commence again to bear interest from the date on which subscriptions are renewed. Note 3. —'When a subscriber is dismissed from the service of Government but has appealed against his removal, the balance at his credit shall not be paid over to him until final orders confirming the decision are passed on his appeal.

The monthly rate of subscription shall be an amount expressed in whole rupees and shall remain fixed through out the financial year. It may be any sum in whole rupees not less than 6^- per cent, of pay {i.e., one anna in the rupee) and not exceeding 15f per cent, {i.e., 2J annas in the rupee), the rate of pay for this purpose being that drawn in respect of the 31st March of the financial year preceding.ailloun t which a subscriber elects to subscribe monthry for each financial year shall be assumed to be re presented })v the deduction which he himself causes to be made in his pay bill for the preceding March : provided that it the sum so deducted is below the minimum or above the ^maximum limit above prescribed, the subscriber shall be assumed to have elected to subscribe the minimum or the maximum permissible amount, as the case may be. The amount thus elected shall not be variable later on in the year on account of any increase or decrease in the rate ot pa\ which may ultimately be found to have been due in respect ot the 31st March preceding or which mav take place during the year. N ote 1.—Explanations and Exceptions— («) Rounding of minimum V ercentaye.—\i 61 per cent, of pav represents a sum not expressible in whole rupees, the nearest sum m whole rupees below that amount shall be taken as the minimum limit of subscription. If 01 per cent, represents a sum of less than one rupee, the minimum limit shall be taken at 8 annas. (b) eiv subscribers. —In the case of new subscribers anv broken period in the month of entry will be neglected, the first subscrip tion being that due in respect of the first complete calendar month. I lie percentages will be reckoned on the rate of pav drawn in res pect (if the first day of such month. I he rate of subscription elected shall be assumed to be represented by the actual deduction which the subscriber himself causes to be made in his pay bill for that month, subject to correction, if necessary, as in the proviso to the substantive rule above. The amount thus elected will not be variable during the remainder of the year. (c) b oreign service. —In the case of a subscriber on foreign ser vice on the .31st March of the preceding financial year, the per centages shall be reckoned on the pay on which his leave and pension contributions are calculated on that date. {d) Government servants holding temporary posts, or on depu- faiion out of India. —In the case of a subscriber who is, on the 31st March of the preceding financial year, holding a temporary post or on deputation out of India, the percentages will be reckoned |pon the pay actually admissible at that date. (e) Leave and suspension. —On a subscriber's return from leave, or reinstatement after suspension, the Fund payments falling due within the same financial year, in respect of the remainder of the month of joining and subsequent months, shall be effected at the rate, if any, already fixed for that year under the substantive rule; otherwise at a new rate, determined in the manner laid down in the substantive rule, with reference to the rate at which pav is drawn in respect of the first day of duty.(y) Piece-workers in Goverrvment Presses. —The subscriptions of piece-workers in Government Presses are not subject to tbe minimum limit of 6^ per cent, of pa}^. In tbeir case the maximum limit of 154 per cent, shall be calculated on the highest earnings drawn for any day falling within the period 15th February to 14th March of the financial year preceding. If, however, a piece-worker lias been absent during the whole of that period the limit of 15f per shall be calculated on the highest earnings drawn for any day oW the first subsequent press month (15th of one month to the 14th of the next month) in which he is employed.. The earnings taken for calculating the maximum limit of subscription shall also be taken for the purpose of calculating the limit of three months pay ordinarily imposed on temporary advances under rule 20 (1). (&lt;7) Other yiece-rate workers. —The subscriptions of section writers, typists, and other piece-rate workers who are members of fixed establishments shall be calculated on their earnings for March of the preceding financial year. These earnings will also be taken as the monthly pay for the purposes of watching the limit of three months' pav ordinarilv imposed on temporary advances under rule 2° (1). ' ' _ N ote 2.—In the case of non-European members of the Indian Civil Service, recruited before August 1914, who have elected not to subscribe to the Indian Civil Service Family Pension T und, the rate of subscription shall be an amount expressed in whole rupees, and may be any sum not exceeding 3^ per cent, of pay, the pay for this purpose being that drawn in respect of the 31st March of the financial year preceding. Subscription during leave. 8. (a) Subscription during leave shall be optional. The monthly amount, if any, subscribed shall be a sum expressed in whole rupees and not exceeding, in the case of leave on average pay, the amount which the subscriber was subscribing prior to proceeding on leave or, in the case of other leave, half that amount. ih) The amount, if any, payable in respect of a month spent partly on duty and partly on leave shall be calculated proportionately; that is to say, at the duty rate for the duty portion and the leave rate, if any, for the leave por tion, each separate amount being rounded to the nearest higher or lower rupee according as the fraction of a rupei^ does, or does not, exceed eight annas. {c) If the amount of a subscriber's leave-salary varies during different periods of his leave, he may, subject to the limits' prescribed in clause («) of this rule, notify his inten tion of subscribing at a different rate for each such period. Tn that case, the subscription payable in respect of a month \7 which includes portions of two such periods shall be cal culated proportionately in the manner indicated in clause (b) of this rule. Subscription in respect of time spent under suspension. 8a. {a) A subscriber on reinstatement after a period passed under suspension shall be allowed the option of subscribing for that period. The monthly amount, if any, subscribed shall be a sum expressed in whole rupees and not exceeding half the amount which the subscriber was subscribing under rule 7 prior to being placed under sus pension. In case, however, the subscriber is allowed full pay for the period of suspension, the maximum amount of subscription permissible shall be the amount which he was subscribing prior to being placed under suspension. ib) In the case of a month spent partly on duty and partly on suspension followed by reinstatement, the amount subscribed shall be calculated proportionately in the man ner indicated in rule 8 (b). Realization of subscriptions. 9 Subscriptions shall be recovered by deduction from pay mils, but they may be made by remittance in cash to the Audit Office when a subscriber is on foreign service, or on leave and draws his leave salary from a Colonial I reasury. When a subscriber draws his leave salary from the Home Treasury of the Government of India his subscrip tions may be paid by deductions from leave salary, the remittances to India being effected by means of the re mittance account between England and India, and the credit to the officer's account in the Fund in respect of such Remittances being given at the current rate for remittance through Government. A subscriber who will draw his leave salary from the Home Treasury of the Government of India and who de sires to subscribe during his leave, or any part of it, shall notify his intention beforehand in order to allow of the deductions from his leave salary being noted in his leave or leave salary certificate. Unless an extension of leave is granted the option thus notified shall be final.8 A subscriber, who fails to notify his intention to con tinue to subscribe when proceeding on leave, can subse quently pay his subscription in cash. Withdrawals on retirement. F 10. The amount which accumulates to the credit of a subscriber in permanent employ shall, when he quits the ser vice, become his property, and shall be handed over to him, unless the Account Officer has received notice of an attach ment, assignment, or encumbrance affecting the disposal of the amount or any portion of it. Should such notice have been received, the Account Officer shall hand over to the sub scriber only that portion of the amount which is not affected by the attachment, assignment, or encumbrance and shall obtain the orders of the Government of India in the Finance Department, as Administrators of the Fund, re garding the disposal of the balance. A subscriber holding a temporary appointment may, subject to the same conditions, either withdraw the amount on the termination of his appointment or leave it in the Fund to be withdrawn at the time he finally quits the service. 11. In the following cases a subscriber may be permit ted to withdraw the deposits at his credit before the actual date of his retirement on the conditions laid down against each :— (1) A subscriber proceeding on leave preparatory to retirement, at any time between the date of his proceeding on leave and the date of retirement, subject, however, to the condition that he may be required, should he return to duty at the end of his leave, to repay to the Fund the whole amount withdrawn by him with interest there on. m (2) A subscriber who obtains a medical certificate oi incapacity for further service, at any time be tween the date of his obtaining such certificate and the date of retirement. 12. Ordinarily, subscribers shall make their own arrangements on retirement to draw in India the amount of their accumulations in the Fund. A subscriber, whether gazetted or non-gazetted, who retires in England, may9 withdraw his accumulations as provided in rule 11 by instructing the Account Officer concerned specifically as to his wishes, i.e., whether the amount is to be remitted to him in England or paid into a bank in India. When, how- ^ ever, an Account Officer has received intimation from the competent authority that the retirement has been sanc tioned of an officer, gazetted or non-gazetted, on leave in England, and when no instructions are received prior to the date from which retirement is to have effect, he shall purchase on that date, or as soon as possible thereafter, sterling bills equivalent to the amount to be handed over to - the retiring officer and send them to him in England. Any further subscription paid by the subscriber in Eng land, of which intimation is subsequently received by the Account Officer, shall be similarly remitted after the sub scriber's account has been finally made up under rule 25. Where the beneficiaries of a deceased subscriber as deter mined by rule 17 are resident in England, the Account Officer in a similar manner, on receipt of due intimation, shall forward the amount payable to them by sterling bills. Disposal on subscriber's death. 13. Each subscriber shall, as soon after he joins the Fund as possible, be called upon by the Account Officer to furnish a ' Form of Declaration ' showing how he wishes the amount of his accumulations to be disposed of on his death. A specimen of this form will be found at the end of these rules. 14. For the purposes of these rules, only the following survivors of a subscriber shall be held to constitute his family :— (1) Widow or widows. (2) Children, (3) Widow, or widows, and children of a deceased son. An adopted child shall be considered to be a child with in the meaning of this rule when, under the personal law of the subscriber, adoption is legally recognised as confer ring the status of a natural child, but in this case only. If doubts arise in an individual case, the Account Officer concerned will refer the matter to the Legal Remembrancer to the Local Government (or corresponding officer) and his opinion shall be final for the purposes of these rules. A10 declaration in favour of an adopted child is made at the subscriber's risk and can be challenged at any time. 15. A subscriber may in his Declaration provide for the distribution of a portion only of the amount. Thus the Form of Declaration may mention a specific sum or a speci- * fic proportion of the total amount. The disposal of the balance shall be governed by rules 17 (b) and 17 {d) below according as the subscriber leaves a family or not. Any Form of Declaration submitted by a subscriber is revocable at any time and from time to time. A fresh Declaration shall be operative only on being received by the Account Officer. On a subscriber's marriage or re marriage, any Declaration already submitted by him shall forthwith become null and void and, unless a revised Form of Declaration is received, the amount of his accumulations shall be dealt with under rule 17 (b) or {d) as the case may be. If minors are nominated in a Form of Declaration, the person or persons to whom sums intended for their benefit are to be paid may be stated m the Form of Declaration. 16. In the event of the subscriber having a family as defined in rule 14, he is not permitted in his Form of Declaration to leave the amount of his accumulations or any part of it to any one outside that family. Where a Form of Declaration purports to leave money otherwise than to a member or members of a subscriber's family, the Account Officer shall call upon the subscriber to state whether he has a family, and if it is found that he has one, the Form of Declaration shall not be accepted. A sub scriber who has a family has absolute discretion regarding the distribution of the amount at his credit at the time of his death among the members of that family. He may exclude any one or more of them in favour of another or others of them and the manner in which the distribution^ is to be made among them is also within his absolute dis cretion. 17. On a subscriber's death before retirement, the amount shall be disposed of as follows :— (a) It or such portion of it as may be specified in an accepted Form of Declaration shall be divided among all or any members of his family in accordance with the terms of the Declaration.11 If the Declaration relates to a portion only of the amount, the balance shall be distributed in the manner described in clause (6) below. If the Declaration does not state the person or persons to whom the sum intended for the benefit of a minor is to be paid, the sum due shall be paid to the minor's legal guardian to be used for the minor's benefit, or, failing a legal guardian, to such person or persons as the officer whose duty it is to make the payment considers to be the proper person or persons to receive it on the minor's behalf. (b) Where a subscriber leaves a family, but no Form of Declaration in favour of any member or mem bers of the family has been received from him, the amount shall be distributed among his family, except that sons and sons of a deceased son, who have attained legal majority, and married daughters, and married daughters of a deceased son, whose husbands are alive, shall be excluded from participation. The division among the persons entitled shall be in equal shares, except that the widow or widows and child or children of any deceased son shall take equally between them only the share which that son would have taken had he survived the subscriber Any sum due to a minor shall be paid to the minor's legal guardian to be used for the minor's benefit, or, failing a legal guardian, to such person or persons as the officer whose duty it is to make the payment considers to be the proper person or persons to receive it on the minor's behalf. ( p ) If there be no party to receive the amount under (a) or (&amp;), it shall be divided among or paid to such person or persons (whether related to the subscriber or not) as may be specified in an accepted Form of Declaration. If the Form of Declaration relates to a portion only of the amount, the balance shall be distributed in the manner described in clause (d).12 {d) If there be no party entitled to receive under {a), (b), or (c) above, the amount shall be paid to the subscriber s legal representative or such other person or persons as may be determined by a Civil Court competent to pass orders in this respect; provided that if the sum remaining at the credit of the subscriber does not exceed Rs. 500, it may be paid to such person or per sons as the officer making the payment considers to be the proper person or persons to receive it. Note 1.—A husband may make a written application for the exclusion of Lis wife from participation under clause (b) if she has been judicially separated from him, Tn the absence of such an application, the widow shall retain her rights under clause (6). Note 2.— When a person named in a Form of Declaration dies before the subscriber, the Declaration shall, in the absence of a direction to the contrary in the Form of Declaration, become null and void in respect of that person, but that person only, and his or her share shall be distributed in the manner described in clause (6) or (d) as the case may be. 18. If the Account Officer receives notice that a will has been left by a deceased subscriber, which purports to dis pose of his accumulations in the Fund or any part of them, he shall, before making any payment, make a reference to the Legal Remembrancer of the Local Government (or cor responding officer) and submit the case, with the opinion of that officer, to the Government of India in the Finance Department for orders. 19. (1) Government will not be bound by, or recognise any assignment or encumbrance executed or attempted to be created which affects the disposal of the accumulations of a subscriber who dies before retirement. (2) The accumulations of the subscriber are not liable to forfeiture on dismissal or on conviction by a Criminal Court, except for an offence for which the penalty of for feiture of the offender's property is prescribed by law. Advances for special 'purposes. 20. (1) No final withdrawal shall be allowed until the subscriber is quitting the service or dies, except in the case of military subordinates in civil employ (who may, at their option, withdraw the sums at their credit, in the event of13 their reverting to their substantive appointment in the military department). But when the pecuniary circum stances of a subscriber are such that the indulgence is ab solutely necessary, a temporary advance not ordinarily ex ceeding three months' pay may be allowed from the sum at his credit at the discretion of the sanctioning authority, who shall be— (i) The Local Government, for subscribers who are gazetted officers; or such heads of departments as the Government of India or the Local Gov ernment, as the case may be, may authorize in this behalf from time to time; (ii) The head of the department, for subscribers who are non-gazetted officers in receipt of Rs. 150 per mensem or over; (Hi) The head of the office, for other subscribers. Note 1.—The delegation of powers to heads of departments imder clause (i) above is subject to the condition that such power shall be exercised in accordance with the spirit of the rules, and that all cases which, in the opinion of the head of the department, are of doubtful nature shall be referred by him for orders to the Government of India or the Local Government, as the case may be. Note 2.—The following officers exercise the powers of the head of a department under clause (n) above: — (1) Post Masters General (including Deputy Post Masters General in charge of Circles).

Note 3. —The following officers exercise the powers of the head of an office under clause (m) above: — Deputy Accountants-General. (2) The following are cited as examples of occasions on which the grant of advances may be considered :— (a) To pay expenses incurred in connection with the illness of a subscriber or a member of his family. (b) To pay for the passage over the sea of a subscriber or any member of his family. (c) To pay expenses in connection with marriages, funerals or ceremonies which by the religion of the subscriber it is incumbent upon him to per form and in connection with which it is obliga tory that expenditure should be incurred. Note .—Advances, though not confined rigidly to the objects laid down in clauses (a) to (c) above, shall be made with due regard to the principle expressed in clause (1) of this rule as illustrated by the foregoing examples. The order sanctioning the advance shall state the specific purpose for which the advance is granted. Where, however, this is of a confidential nature, it may be com municated to the Account Officer personally and confidentially. ( (3) When one or more advances have already been granted to a subscriber, a subsequent advance shall not be granted to him, except for strong reasons to be recorded in writing by the sanctioning authority until at least twelve months have elapsed since the complete repayment of tiie last advance taken. The Account Officer shall bring to notice instances in which the spirit of this instruction appears to be disregarded.15 (4) {a) Advances shall be recovered, at the discretion of the sanctioning authority, in not less than twelve in stalments or, unless the Government of India in special ''' circumstances otherwise direct, more than twenty-four. A a ^ subscriber may, however, at his option make repayment in K y (&gt; less than 12 instalments or may repay two or more instal- i ments at the same time. ^ f (b) In determining the advance to be sanctioned, due regard shall be paid to the amount of subscriptions lying dLur, ' ^ to the credit of the subscriber. The amount of the advance shall be a sum expressed in whole rupees and, ordinarily, the monthly instalments shall also be in whole rupees, the tlx- advance applied for being raised or reduced, if neces- % / sary, to enable instalments to be thus fixed. (c) Recoveries shall be made monthly, commencing from the first payment of a full month's salary after the advance is granted, but no recovery shall be made from a subscriber while he is on leave of any kind. Recovery may also be postponed by the sanctioning authority while an advance granted to the officer otherwise than from the Fund is being recovered. (d) When two or more advances are made, each advance shall be treated separately, and the monthly deduction of not less than one twenty-fourth of each advance shall be made until that advance is cleared. (e) The instalments shall be recovered by compulsory deductions from pay, ^nd shall be paid in addition to the usual subscription, if any. (5) When an advance is repayable in 12 instalments, an additional instalment, representing interest and equivalent to 4 per cent, of the amount of the advance, shall be paid in the month following that in which the last instalment is paid. Similarly, two additional instalments representing interest, each equivalent to 4 per cent, of the total amount of the advance shall be paid when the advance is repayable in more than 12 instalments, provided that where an ad vance is recovered in more than 24 instalments the Govern ment of India shall determine what interest shall be paid by the subscriber and the number of instalments in which it shall be paid. In calculating interest as above, a fraction of a rupee shall be taken at the next higher whole rupee if it exceeds eight annas, and shall be ignored if it does not.16 Mohammedan subscribers whose deposits in the Fund carry no interest shall not be required to pay into the Fund additional instalments on account of interest on the advan ces granted to them from the Fund. Substitution of other forms of life insurance for suhscriy- tions to the Fund. Note .—The provisions of rule 21, so far as thev relate to policies of insurance, are not applicable to subscribers ioininff tlie fund after the 1st September 1919. 21. Subscriptions to a recognised family pension fund or payments towards a policy of insurance may. at the option of subscribers, be substituted for subscriptions to the General Provident Fund, subject to the following conditions :— (i) If the subscriptions or payments to be so substituted shall be of less amount than the minimum sub scription under rule 7 of these rules, the defi ciency shall be paid by the subscriber as a sub scription to the General Provident Fund. Note .—The monthly payment on account of dpficiencjr shall be a sum expressed in whole rupees. For this purpose in calculat ing the difference to be made ^rood, the total family pension or insurance payments made in a year will be divided by 12, and the resultant amount (if not itself in whole rupees) will be rounded to the nearest higher or lower rupee according as the broken portion does or does not exceed 8 annas. {ii) An insurance policy shall be on the subscriber's own life, in which case*it is immaterial what form the policy takes, i.e., it may be a life or an endowment, or double endowment policy, but it shall be such as is legally assignable to Gov ernment. Note 1.— A guarantee policy which ensures the payment of the sum assured in the event of the policy-holder being retired by the Medical Board shall be accepted for the purposes of this rule. A contingent annuity, which, in the event of his death, ensures a certain income to the insurer's wife or children, or both, shall also be accepted for the purposes of this rule. Note 2.—If a policy of insurance is effected by a subscriber on his own life for the benefit of a sole beneficiary specifically named therein, a formal assignment by both the insured and the sole beneficiary shall be permissible. An assignment of a policy effected by a subscriber on his own life for the benefit of more than one bene ficiary whether existent or not at the date of the policv shall not, in view of the attendant legal difficulties, be permissible under this rule.17 {iii) Government shall not make any payments on be half of subscribers to insurance companies nor shall they take steps to keep the policy alive. If a subscriber records on his pay bill that he is making payments to an insurance company or to a pension fund of not less amount than the minimum subscription prescribed in rule 7 of these rules, the Account Officer shall content himself by demanding periodically to see the receipts or certified copies of the receipts showing that such payments have been made. Failing such receipts he shall make the neces sary deduction from the subscriber's pay and place i't to his credit in the 'Fund. Should subscribers prefer to do so, they may make the usual deduction from their pay bills for credit to the Fund and arrange with the Account Officer to draw from the Fund, at stated intervals, the sums necessary to pay quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly premia. {iv) Any sums already at the credit of the subscriber in the Fund may be withdrawn for payment of premia or for the purchase of a single-payment life policy; but the utilization of sums already at credit shall not relieve the subscriber from continuing to make the usual deduction from his current salary within the usual limits pre scribed in rule 7 of these rules whether the amount is to be paid into the Fund or towards an insurance policy, except when the subscriber is on leave and exercises the option allowed by rule 8 to discontinue subscriptions. {v) [a) If a policy of insurance matures, not at death, but after a term of years, the sum accruing, with the assent of the assured, shall be drawn by Government and placed at his credit in the Fund, If the assured so desires, he may himself withdraw the sum accruing, on the conditions laid down in clause (vi) below. {h) The bonuses which accrue on any policy may be allowed to accumulate with the policy until the18 I latter matures. If, however, it is incumbent on the policy-holder to withdraw them as they fall due, the amounts shall be credited in the Fund to the subscriber's account. (c) The sum which accumulates to the credit of the subscriber shall be dealt with (on his quitting the service or in the event of his death before retirement) in accordance with rules 10 and 17. (vi) In the event of a subscriber's interest in a recog nised family pension fund, any subscriptions to which shall have been substituted under sub-rule (i) for his subscriptions to the General Provident Fund, ceasing from any cause whatever or of a policy of assurance, any payments for pre- mia on which shall have been so substituted or withdrawn under sub-rule (iv) from sums already at credit of such subscriber in the Gene ral Provident Fund, being allowed to lapse or being assigned, charged, or encumbered (except in favour of Government as hereinafter men tioned) or maturing and the amount thereof being withdrawn by the assured under sub-rule (v) (a), the amounts of the payments or subscrip tions so substituted or withdrawn, as the case may be, shall be paid or repaid, with interest thereon, as the case may be, by such subscriber to the Account Officer and shall in default be deducted from such subscriber's pay. (vii) A policy, the payment or payments for any fremia on which shall, under this rule, be substituted for subscriptions to the Fund or withdrawn from the sums at the credit of a sub scriber for the same purpose and which has not already been assigned to the Secretary of State for India in Council and delivered to the Ac count Officer under this rule, shall, within three months of such payment or withdrawal, be so assigned and delivered as security for the pay ment contingently of the sum which in the event of lapse of the policy or any assignment, charge or encumbrance thereof or thereon shall, under the last preceding sub-rule, become payable by the subscriber to the Fund. No payment so made19 by a subscriber shall be considered as in substi tution for any subscription by him to the lund unless and until the life policy shall have been so assigned, and in default of such assignment within three months, after such payment or withdrawal, as the case may be, the amount so paid or withdrawn, as the case may be, shall forthwith be paid or repaid, as the cnse may be, by the subscriber concerned to the Account Officer or shall in default be deducted from such subscriber's pay. ^■ 0XE&gt; —I n cases of Insurance Companies whose headquarters are outside India, the limit of three months may be extended by the Account Officer so as to allow time for the policies to reach India after preparation, provided that the policy-holder satisfies him by producing the completion certificate (otherwise called Interim Receipt) that the insurance has been duly effected. {viii) (a) The assignment of a policy under the preced ing sub-rule shall be endorsed on the policy and shall be in the following form :— ' T, A. B., of—, hereby assign unto the Secretary of State for India in Council the within policy of assurance as security for payment of all sums which under rule 21 of the rules of the General Provident Fund I may here after become liable to pay to that Fund. Or, in the case of policies of insurance effected by the subscriber for the benefit of a sole beneficiary, as follows ' We, A. B. (the subscriber), of and C. D. (the sole beneficiary of the Policy) of iu consideration of the Secretary of State for India in Council agreeing at our request to 'accept payments towards the within policy of assurance in substitution for the subscriptions payable bv me the said A. B. to the General Provident Fund, hereby jointly and severallv assign unto the said Secretary of State the within policy of assurance as security for payment of all sums which under Rule 21 of the rules of the said Fund, the said A. B. may hereafter become liable to pay to that Fund.' (b) Save as provided in sub-rule {viii) (d), the po llc y shall be re-assigned to the subscriber, and handed back to him on his quitting the service,20 or on his refunding any advances taken from the General Provident Fund for the purpose of pa} ing 'premia thereon with the full interest thereon, and in the event of his death before quitting the service, a re-assignment shall be executed in favour of, and the policv handed to, r the legal representative of his estate as deter mined by a Civil Court having competence to pass orders in this respect. Specimen forms of re-assignment will be found at the end of these rules. ^ Notice of a re-assignment shall be sent to the insurance company by the Account Officer. (c) Save as provided in sub-rule (viii) (d), the policy may also be re-assigned to the subscriber before the date of his actual retirement in the cases and subject to the conditions laid down in rule 11, and subject also to the further condition that, should he return to duty at the end of his leave, he shall be required to re-assign the policy to the Secretary of State, or, in the event of the policy having lapsed or becoming incumbered or otherwise incapable of assignment, to repay into the Fund either the amounts of substituted pay ments or of subscriptions withdrawn from the Fund, as the case may be, with interest thereon, 01, in the event of the policy having matured the sum realised from the insurance company. (d) If notice has been received by the Account Officer of any assignment or attachment of, or encum brance on the policy, he shall not execute a re assignment of the policy in favour of the sub scriber or, in the event of his death, of the legal representative of his estate as determined W a Civil Court having competence to pass orders in this respect, until he shall have obtained the orders of the Government of India in the f Finance Department. (z&gt;) The following procedure shall be observed in re gard to the assignment and re-assignment of life policies :— (a) When the assigned policy is delivered to the Account Officer under sub-rule (vit) above, it shall be accompanied by a certi-21 ficate from the subscriber to the effect that no prior assignment of the policy exists. The Account Officer shall satisfy himself independently that this is the case by direct reference to the insurance company. (b) Notice of the assignment of the policy shall be given by the subscriber to the insurance company and acknowledgment of the notice of the insurance company shall be sent by the subscriber to the Account Officer within three months of the date of the assignment. Subscribers are advised to send notice of the assignment to the insurance company in duplicate, accompanied, in cases in which the notice has to be sent to a company in Great Britain or Ireland, by a remittance of five shillings, which is the fee for the ac knowledgment authorised by the Policies of Assurance Act, 1867. The policy itself, bearing the assignment endorsed thereon, need not be sent to the company as insu rance companies do not ordinarily require the production of the original instruments affecting a policy-holder's title until the policy becomes a claim. Note .—Subscribers wbo proceed to Great Britain or Ireland on quitting the service are advised that under the English Stamp Law assignments or re-assignments are required to be stamped within 31 days of their first arrival in those countries. Otherwise penalty will be incurred under the Stamp Act and difficulties may arise when the policy matures for payment. Note .—The provisions of Rule 21-A apply only to subscribers joining the Fund after the 1st of September 1919. 21-A. (a) A bachelor subscriber to the Fund may sub stitute, for subscriptions to the General Provident Fund, payments towards any policy of assurance effected on his own life, provided that, if such policy matures, not at death, but after a period of years, the date of maturity may not be earlier than the earliest date on which the subscriber may, by the terms of his service, retire. (b) A married subscriber to the Fund may substitute, for subscriptions to the General Provident Fund, payments towards either (i) a policy of assurance effected on his own life, if the policy, on the face of it, is for the benefit ofhis wife or of his children or of any or all of these, pro vided that, if such policy matures not at death, but after a period of years, the date of maturity shall not be earlier than the earliest date on which the subscriber may, by the terms of his service, retire; or (ii) any policy of assu rance effected on his own life which he has assigned to trustees by a deed of settlement for the benefit of his wife or of his children or of any or all of these. (c) A married subscriber to the Fund may substitute, or continue to substitute, as the case may be, for contributions to the General Provident Fund, payments towards a policy of assurance on his own life to which he has already been subscribing, provided that he either {i) assigns his existing policy to trustees by a deed of settlement for the benefit of his wife or of his children or of any or all of these; or (ii) converts his policy into a policy of assurance effected on his own life, but expressed on the face of it to be for the benefit of his wife or of his children or of any or all of these, provided that if such policy matures not at death, but after a period of years, the date of maturity shall not be earlier than the earliest date on which he may, by the terms of his service, retire; or {Hi) converts his policy into any policy of assurance effected on his own life, and then assigns it to trustees by a deed of settlement for the benefit of his wife or of his children or of any or all of these, and pro vided that if he has, as a bachelor, been substituting for contributions to the Fund payments towards such policy of assurance, then such assignment, conversion or conver sion and assignment, shall be effected before or within three months after his marriage. Note 1.— If upon the conversion o-f an existing policy any portion of the surrender value of such policy is not applied in effect ing the new policy, such portion shall be paid or repaid to the Fund and placed to the credit of the subscriber's account. Note 2.—It is brought to the notice of all subscribers that the settlement of a policy of assurance upon a wife, if effected after marriage, does not receive the same protection in law as if effected before marriage, so that members who desire to take advantage of the provisions contained in sub-rules (h) {ii), (c) (i) or (c) (m) above should, in their own interests, do so, if possible, before marriage. The following conditions shall be fulfilled :— {i) If the subscriptions or payments to be so substituted shall be of less amount than the minimum sub-23 scription under rule 7 of these rules, the de ficiency shall be paid by the subscriber as a subscription to the General Provident Fund. (ii) Government shall not make payments on behalf of subscribers to insurance companies nor shall they take steps to keep the policy alive. If a sub scriber records on his pay bill that he is making payments to an insurance company of not less amount than the minimum subscription pre scribed in rule 7 of these rules, the Ac count Officer shall content himself by demand ing periodically to see the receipts or certified copies of the receipts showing that such pay ments have been made. Failing such receipts he will order the necessary deduction to be made from the subscriber's pay and placed to his credit in the Provident Fund. Should sub scribers prefer to do so, they may make the usual deduction from their pay bills for credit to the Provident Fund and arrange with the Account Officer to draw from the Fund, at stated inter vals, the sums necessary to pay quarterly, half- yearly, or yearly premia. (Hi) Subject to the foregoing, any sums already at the credit of the subscriber in the Provident Fund may be withdrawn for payment of premia or for the purchase of a single payment policy; but the utilization of sums already at credit will not relieve the subscriber from continuing to make the usual deduction from his current salary within the usual limits prescribed in rule 7 of these rules except when the subscriber is on leave and exercises the option allowed by rule 8 to discontinue subscriptions. {iv) In the event of a policy of assurance, any payments for premia on which shall have been substituted for contributions to, or withdrawn from accu mulations in, the General Provident Fund, being allowed to lapse, the amounts of the pay ments or subscriptions so substituted or with drawn, as the case may be, shall with interest thereon be paid or repaid, as the case may be, by such subscriber to the Account Officer and24 shall in default be deducted from such sub scriber s pay.
