INDIA OFFICE, LOJTDON, S.W. 1., 4th November, 1935. My dear Fowle, As regards oil in the Persiiwi Gulf, I write with reference to my telegram of 28th October to let you know that Sir Edmund Davis first postponed and therjc an celled his appointment. The reason is explained in the letter from Holmes of 24th October of which copy has gone to you by air mail. On 23rd October Skliros and Lefroy called here and made a proposal which is briefly recapitulated in the former’s letter of 24th October, of which copy has also been sent by air mail. Further points which arose in the interview with Skliros and Lefr 0 y are stated in the letter of which I enclose a copy, and which has been addressed to Starling, Rendel and Seal. Could you kindly let us know whether you concur in the proposals which are also made in the letter to the other Departments concerned ? As regards paragraph 7 (c) of that letter, it seems sufficient to inform the Company in these terms of the preliminary condition to be required of the Shaikhs, though in addressing the latter this condition could be made full and precise in the manner suggested in your note of 3rd October which you recorded here. I am sending copy of this letter and its enclosures to Metcalfe. Yours sincerely, sd. M.J.Clauson (for J.C.Walton).Copy. P.Z. 7763/35. India Office, Whitehall,S.W.l. 1st November 1935. Important . I enclose copy of a letter from Mr. J. Skliros, Managing Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company, regarding a proposed procedure for acquiring options, and subsequently possible concessions, for oil in certain areas in the Persian Gulf. Certain points in this letter were more fully explained at an interview which I had with Mr.Skliros and Mr. Lefroy of the Anglo-Iranian Cil Company on 23rd October. 2. The reason for forming a company - Petroleum Concessions, Limited _ separate from the Iraq Petroleum Company is, I understood, merely that the latter company has an Iraqi Government director, and it is not considered necessary or desirable that he should participate in under takings solely concerned with the acquisition of concessions in countries outside Iraq. 3. As regards the Kuwait neutral zone. Petroleum Conceseions, Limited, are aware of the position of deadlock resulting from Ibn Saud , s commitment to the Standard Oil of California, but they think that by the offer of an arrangement to facilitate the marketing of the Bahrain Petroleum Company*s production they may obtain the necessary leverage to induce the California Company to relinquish their stranglehold on Ibn Saud*s part-interest in the Kuwait neutral zone. 4. Vith reference to the unallotted area of Bahrain, Mr. x Lefroy did not think that this would be of value to anyone, while to obtain an option with a view to its examination. but Mr. Skliros was inclined to think that it might be worth P.C.Stlft.7*! ino* *n*«3 n Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, S.W.l. So /- 2 - ^8 .0. r is*! |V So far as I know, we have not entered into commitments with anyone regarding this area, so that it is presumably open to sny company which desires to do so to apply to the Shaikh for a c oncession( subj ect, of course, to His Majesty* s Gov ernment * s approval)* 5« On the True ial Coast the /.nglo-Iranian Oil Company (or the D*/rcy Exploration Company) heve, as you know, already obtained two-year options, subject to His Majesty’s Government’s approval, at Has al Khaimah and Sharjah* Mr. * See papers enclosed with India Office )Lefroy stated that printed letters P.Z.5980, dated find ) September 1935, and P.Z.7001, dated 3rd )they have just October 1935, respectively. ) obtained a similar option at Debai. They are also in the field for options at ■'bu Dhabi, /jman and TTmm-al-Qaiwain. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company would go forward with their pending negotiations, but any concessions for which they have acquired or may acquire options on the Trucial) Coast would be negotiated and taken by Petroleum Concessions, Limited. 6. The reference to the Pirate Coast is a geographical misunderstanding. Petroleum Concessions, Limited, might interest itself in the possibilities of Muscat^ where we have not committed ourselves to anyone and the field is consequently open. I stated that certain preliminary conditions to the approval of options on the Trucial Coast (which had been discussed with Fowle during his deputation) would be required by Hi s Majesty’s Government, viz: Vis a vis the Company:- (a) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the trucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationality; (b) /3- (b) that the exploring party in their travels would be definitely guided by the viev/s of the Resident es to where they should go. Vis-a-vis the Shaikh :- (c) that the Shaikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing that he would be responsible for the safety of the exploring or surveying party. I added that another condition to the approval of an option would be that further approval by His Majesty’s Government would be necessary before negotiations for an actual concession were entered into with the Shaikh concerned. 8. The question of our future policy on the Trucial Coast, which was discussed by the Middle East Committee on 24th September, has, of course, a certain relevance to the question whether in this backward and uncivilised area the acquisition of oil concessions by any company, of whatever nationality, ought to be encouraged or permitted. The result of the meeting in regard to general policy was somewhat inconclusive, but there is, I think, nothing in the conclusions, such as they were, to suggest that we ought to arrive at a definite decision to sterilise the Trucial Coast so far as oil is concerned. Indeed, :he trend of the discussion was rather in the opposite direction, and Eowle himself, though he is averse from any new pronoucement of general policy, has always taken the view that in regard to oil we can hardly impose an absolute veto on concessions which the Shaikhs may wish to grant, though specially careful conditions to safeguard the interests of His Majesty’s Govern ment and limit our commitments would be necessary. In any case, by stipulating that the actual commencement of negotiations for a concession, apart from the conditions on which it should be /- 4 - i &lt;4 be granted, will be subject to His Majesty's Government's approval, we shall, so far as is now practicab le, ensure that each case is kept open for decision by His Majesty's Govern ment, when the time comes, in the light of considerations of general policy and of the degree of commitment which the grant of any concession would involve. 9. (Bn the question of nationality, it will be seen that the national complexion of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, is identical with that of the Iraq Petroleum Company. It was explained to me that Petroleum Concessions, Limited, would \ probably beget separate companies to exploit the several ^ areas in which they might be successful in obtaining concess ions, but that such f re the national jealousies on the ja rt of the non-British elements in the Iraq Petroleum Company that there is no chance of such companies being formed on a basis of a larger proportion of British ownership than that in the I raq Petrol eum Company itself. As, however, the areas mentioned (apart, possibly, from the Kuwait neutral zone} are within the Red Line Agreement, it seems necessary to be content with the Iraq Petroleum Company's proportion of British shareholding, since no British company outside the Iraq Petroleum Company has shown a serious interest in these areas. Holmes has indeed been angling during the last few months for the interest of an all-British group(which, however, had no experience of oil concessions), but I have now heard from him that his negotiations hsve definitely broken down. 10. If the Petroleum Department and the other Departments concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf agree, we would propose to inform Petroleum Concessions, Limited, as follows:- (a) On the Trucial Coast, subject to the conditions stated above, His Majesty's Government approve the options already / f 1 v ' ^ jh n « •already granted by the Shaikhs of Has al Khaimah, Sharjah end Detoai, and ary options that may be granted by other Shaikhs. If it is desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Shaikh concerned for a concession, the pr ior approval of His Majesty's Government will be required before such negotiations are opened. In the event of such approval to the commencement of negotiations being given, the conditions to safeguard Government interests which would have to be attached to any concession obtained would be considered and would have to be accepted by the com pany before an actual concession was approved. (b) In Bahrain and Muscat there is no objection to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, applying to the rulers concerned, on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests. (c) As regards the Kuwait neutral zone, application may be made to the Shaikh of Kuwait for an option for his part-interest in the zone, on the understanding that, if it should later become possible for the Company to seek a concession from him and Ibn Saud jointly, the prior approval of His Majesty's Government would hsve to be sought before the company entered into negotiations with those rulers, and any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such conditions (whch might be of a special character, in view of the peculiar juridical position of the zone) as were considered necessary to safeguard British political interests. 11. It will be observed that the Company propose to employ Holmes for the negotiations of actual concessions. Mr. Skliros explained that this proposal was made faute demieux . It is of course primarily the business of the Company whom they employ and, subject to Fowle*s views, we do not think that we need make any objection. 12. If Petroleum Concessions Limited should make the application, of which the possibility is foreseen in the penultimate paragraph of Mr.SklirosSs letter, for special permission for Mr. Baker to visit areas on the frucial Coast, we could consider in consultation with Fowle the question of making an exception i# that particular case from the general rule suggested in paragraph 7(a) above. 13. I am sending a similar letter to Rendel and Seal, and a letter, of which a copy is enclosed, to Air Vice Marshal Courtney. lie should be grateful if you could let us have an early reply as we should like to let Petroleum Concessions Limited have a reply to their enquiry as soon as possible.

ADMIRALTY, Military Branch, 29th November 1935. 1 My desr Walton, ^ t* '’ In reply to your letter P.Z.7763/35 dated 4th November 1935, enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr.Skliros about the proposed procedure for dealing with oil concessions in certain areas in the Persian Gulf, I write to say that the Admiralty are mainly concerned in the matter of safeguards. This question, although not at present urgent, is bound sooner or later to arise if oil is discovered. We note that Mr. Skliros 0 stated in his letter of the 24th October that the provisions of the &lt;^atar Government Agreement would be generally acceptable to the new Company# As you know, this agreement (like that for Kuwait) deals with the question of a refinery in a somewhat unsatisfactory manner by a mere declaration of intention on the part of the Company to erect a refinery if commercial conditions justify it, and to examine the matter with H#M.Government when commercial production is assured. Every new concession granted in countries bordering the Persian Gulf accentuates the importance of the refinery question and it would be most unfortunate if the greater prrt of the territory were developed without any binding obligation on the part of the Company to build at least one refinery. We do not think that the relaxation of our requirements in this respect in the i^at&amp;r and Kuwait concessions, in each case after long discussion with the companies , is a good reason for accepting the same position without further dis cussion in any future concessions. We feel, therefore, that new / ■ C.Walton,Esq.,C.B.,M.C., India Office, S. W.l#- 2 - new dreft concessions should contain the approved standard refinery clause and that any relaxation should be agreed to only when good reasons are forthcoming. jfe do not suggest that there is any necessity to raise the matter in this form with the Company at the present stage, but in view of Mr. Skliroe* reference to the ^atar agreement we think it desira bp: that the Company should be reminded that the erection of a refinery or refineries in territory under British influence in the Persian Gulf is one of the prime desiderata of H 0 M.Government• Perhaps, therefore, you would be good enough to include such a reference in your reply. Apart from the foregoing we have no comments to offer on your proposed action. Copies of this letter are being sent to Air Vice Marshal Courtney, Rendal and Starling.

My dear Dalton, Thank you for your letter of the 12th December, under reference P.Z.8856/35, relative to questions of oil on the Arabian side of the Persian ^ulf. I am gald you have been able to approve the options which we have obtained on thr^e of the territories along the Trucial Coast. We have just heard from Abadan that he Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has been away hunting and that they anticipate an early renewal of negotiations with him for a similar option. Regarding vjatar, I should anticipate that a separate subsidiary for this area is likely to be formed by Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and it would be to that subisdiary that we should oontempfcte transferring our concession. So far as anything is difinitely settled among *the Groups'*, 'P.C.L.'* will not operate concessions but will seek for them and form separate companies for the operation of any concessions obtained. When the appropriate time comes we shall certainly make the formal application to which you refer, for permission \ to transfer the Qjatar concession. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) L. LE5R0Y.

You informed me verbally that Tunb 'was eant to come in the agreement; really sneaking this information as hurt me. &gt;’e had not thought it important at the time to mention t, and moreover under cover of our letter dated 4th Shaban 1354, e drew the attention of the Company to the said places and our sland Tunb, both of which have not been surveyed by the geologists, as the Company any intention to survey these parts or are they .atisfied ’ ith the places already surveyed in the past. If the bmpany has any intention to carry out this, then v/e have to make Isenarate agreement, on the lines of the previous one; the places urveyed by the geologists are the places specified under the ording 'our territory and surroundings' as laid down in the greement. This matter has been communicated to the Political gent.

The original agreement (see Captain Cole’s letter C /427 Jugust 7th, 1935) reads 'I have authorized you to enter n$’ country for the examination of mines of oil in ay country of R; s al Khaimah and its surroundings which are under my government”. The essential /rah rords are ”fl biladi Has al Kheimah was atrafiha alti taht hukumina”. Later in the agreement it is written n I have promised that I will not negotiate with any other company for mineral oil in my country of Fas al Khaiaah. The essential words are 'fi bilaai Has al Khaimah”. I do not, of course, know what passed when the agreement was drawn up and it may be that the term was su, . osed to include Tunb Island. If so, a word like ’ f tv;abiha' ^dependencies) vould have been more suitable. From Political, B&amp;hrain To Resident, Bushire t/60-lC '10 { ^ ate ^ 5 th February s. 6. Mi I —AOQS&amp;P- HM-480)—26-7 *1—2^0,000.7 ),On the yordinal of the sgreeinent as it stands, i ctnnot help feeling doubtful whether it can be held to include lunb Island. It would be possible, perhaps, to claim that in such an agreement the words 'biladi Res al KhaimEh' should be interpreted rs e general term covering all the Shaikh*s dominions as we s eak and write of the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah). But in that cese the words 'va atrefiha elti taht hukumina ,, would be unnecessary, es the Shaikh could not sign away any area surround ing his dominions, so that they tend to support the Shaikh's contention, and tese words can hardly be interpreted to mean his island. 4. However the wording may be read, it is vague and I fear that the matter may become troublesome if the question of inter pretation is pressed. I am, theref re, inclined to suggest t^at the Company should be advised not to pursue the matter on paper, but to write and. say that Major Holmes (on the assumption that he is now in ’oil’ charge of the Truciai Coast) will ^.if Cod is rilling) visit Res al Khaimeh later on and discuss the matter with him (the Shaikh). I have little doubt that *a;jor holmes will be able to arrange the matter suitably. I think too that it is most inadvisable for us to be drawn into the controversy if it can possibly be svoided.

Please see paragraph 3 of my letter of 16th November 1935, No.877-S,to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a copy of which was sent to you under my Printed Letter No* 888 -S of the same date. The wording of the relevant clause of the agreement seems to me to be quite clear: 'My country' 4 obviously refers to Ras al Khaimah territory on the mainland, and 'its surroundings under my government' exactly covers the case of a piece of outlying territory like Tamb Island. 3. I am therefore definitely of the opinion that Tamb Island is included in the Compeny’s option. There is no question of our avoiding a 'controversy' (last line of your Express Letter). When British interests are concerned, and they are in the right, we have to support them, as we must do on the present occasion.
