Sir# I have the honour to forward herewith for whatever action you may deem fit the translation of a letter received from His Hi hness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman in which he complains of the encroachment into muscat territory 01 a party of 3-4- English Geologists accompanied by Sultan bin hayia said to be one of the relatives of the SheiEh of Abu -nabi. 2 # The Buraixai District where the oil reconnaissance is said to have taken place is a large oasis on the edge ox the desert country some 7o miles due west of Sohar. The exact boundaries here-abouts have never been properly ceiined but X understand Buraimi has always been claimed by Muscat ana in fact does belong to the State even though as the Sultan plaintively remarked to me the iidiabitants never pay Zamat. s&lt; Ho mention is made in the Sultan's letter of the date of the alleged reconnaissance at Buraimi but in a conversation I had today with His Highness he informed me that he understands it too* piace about one month ago. 4&gt; 8 WBS expected with the coming of Gil oncessioi Companies boundary problems are certain to arise and 1 propoe to take this opportunity of urging the Sultan for nis oun advantage to make an effort to define the land iscx limits oj. his State as early as possible though X am airaid ti at even thiss Translation of a letter dated the 8th Habi Awwal 1356, corresponding to the 19th May 1937, from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat &amp; Omn, Muscat to the Political Agent &amp; HtB.M's Consul, Muscat* After compliments, We have informed you verbally that the Wall of Sohar has reported to us that one of the Shai&amp;is of Abu Dhabi named Sultan bin Zayid arrived in the territory of Buraimi accompanied by three or four Englishmen represent ing a certain Oil Company, with a view to mahing a research of the said territory* As you are aware Buraimi is within/ the boundaries of Oman, and the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi have no right to interfere. We would therefore request th*t you will maJce verification into the matter through the Hobble the Political Resident* There is no doubt that such a question is likely to cause some misunderstanding with the Shaikhs of the Coast, such also is the venture of the Company^ Representatives by their entry from the direction of the Ccs st into a territory which belongs to and lies within the boundaries of Oman* Usual Ending*CONFIDENTIAL.

SIMLA.* The 2nd July, 1940* ( Dear Prior, Dr* Fox, the Director of the Geological Survey of India, has suggested that a good deal of useful help might be given to officers in the Gulf if occasionally ofiicers of the Geological Survey of India were invited to spend ) two or three weeks with them as mineral advisers* These Geological officers would go on study leave or would make a halt en route to or from leave in the United Kingdom* tfhile at the headquarters of Political agents, they could read over the files, make contact with the geologists of Companies at work there and perhaps see a little of the country where minerals are believed to occur* In this way it might be possible to avoid misunderstandings here (which local knowledge alone can prevent) and also provide yourself and Political Agex^te with useful advice* 2* Fox’s suggestion appears to us to have much to commend it and we should be grateful for your views* Yours sincerely, sd* »*R*Hay* The Hon’ble IWCol*C*G♦Prior, Cl Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*CONFIDENTIAL No, C/428.
