Correspondence is sent and received by a host of British officials including political and consular agents and RAF officers.A telex sent by the Political Resident to the Government of India on 25 November 1940 reported that Italian radio broadcasts had claimed success in a bombing raid over Bahrain, accounting for recent reports of unidentified aircraft in the area (folio 6). A large part of the correspondence in the file concerns payments made by the crew of the B-17 Flying Fortress to local Arabs, who offered them water and assistance. The crew members gave an array of banknotes to one man, which staff at the Political Agency in Bahrain attempted to convert into rupees at the Eastern Bank (folio 38). Further correspondence relates to a complaint made by the clerk at the Agency in Sharjah, over abuse directed at him by staff from the RAF base in the town (folios 46-47).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000093#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000093#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000093#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000093#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
