GOVERNMENT OP INDIA. r FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. t O w j To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., Ms Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 24:th April 1913. My Lord Marquess, We have the honour to refer to Lord Morley’s telegram, dated the ‘ 21st August 1908, regarding the murder of certain subjects of the Trucial Chief of Abu Thabi on the pearl banks by Persian subjects. 2. It is unnecessary for us to recapitulate in this despatch the facts of this case which are not disputed and are well known to Your Lordship. It will be sufficient to remark that attempts to obtain from the Persian Government adequate satisfaction for the crime have failed, and they have declined to pay the blood-money and compensation which was assessed at over £ 1 , 000 . 3. Sir P. Cox has now suggested that a sum of Rs. 11,000, out of the • m* telega from Hi. E.cdlencj the Vieercy, fin0 ° f Es - 50,000* exacted from the dated the 23rd January i 9 ii. Shaikh of Debai in connection with the attack on the landing party from the “ Hyacinth ” in December 1910, may be paid to the Shaikh of Abu Thabi as compensation for the murder of his subjects. 4. As soon as the financial position of the Persian Government has be come assured, His Majesty’s Government will doubtless press for a settlement of the Abu Thabi claim. But in the meantime it is important, from more than one point of view, to remove the grievance of the Shaikh of Abu Thabi. The murder case has remained unsettled for ten years and is a chronic source i of grievance to the Shaikh, who never fails to refer to it when the Political Resident has any occasion to meet him. Moreover, it forms a continual basis for the general complaint, on the part of the Trucial Shaikhs, that while we exact claims against them with rigour we fail to exhibit the same energy in exacting claims on their behalf. j t * \ ( 12 MAY1913 JNot only would the settlement of the present case generally produce a favourable impression but, as tending to placate the Trucial Chiefs, it may help to facilitate the installation of wireless telegraphy on the coast. 5. The fine exacted from Dehai was under accounts rules credited to Government in 1912-13, hut, in the circumstances stated, we trust that Your Lordship will not withhold your approval to the payment of the proposed compensation to the Shaikh of Abu Thabi. We have the honour to be, My Loud Marquess, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, e • * l^.CQA.[ Confidential^ No. 484, dated Bushire, the 10th-(received 19th) March 1912.

Your Excellency, I have received Your Excellency’s note of the 21st instant and in reply I have the honour to state that according to the statements made by Muhammad Ben Majid and Ali Ben Majid to Ahmed ben Sultan, the Shari Hakem of Abu Thabi, in the month of Shavval 1322, they suspected three men of the murder of four of their own relatives and the names of two of the suspected persons given by them were Muhammad Ben Jasem and Ghais Ben Jasem. No other name was given. These three men are the very same men of whom one was killed w hen being arrested while the other two were arrested and kept in gaol in Ears tor a Ion a* time. One of the two died of cholera in gaol and the other was trie twice in the Kargozari at Shiraz in the presence of the British Consul. No charge of murder could be brought home to any of them and therefore the Persian Government have not failed in the execution of justice. Under these circumstances there are no funds out of which the Persian Government cou pay compensation to the heirs. Jl avail, Gtc., (Signed) VOSSTJK-ED-DOWLEH.

Repeated schemes of Vice-Consulate, Lingah, and efforts of His Majesty’s Ships to round up and arrest the other two brothers during pearling seasons 1910 and 1911 (which has just finished) have proved abortive. The trial of the other brother at Abu Thabi, in the absence of living evidence, proved impracticable and he has been detained at Bahrain pending apprehension of his brothers and arraignment with them. He has behaved w r ell, and I am of opinion that he might now be set free, and that we must fall back on monetary solution indicated in latter part of my letter, No. 71, dated 16th June 1905, to His Majesty’s Legation.

At the conclusion of that service she will proceed to Bushire, before going to Bahrein, bringing the pirate if the search for him proves successful.

Reis All, referred to in the first paragraph of my letter of 20th June, was expelled and various fines were extracted. The Seyed Murteza was doported to Kerb*]a by mail steamer on 7th instant. The Darya Bqgi now considers that the Tangistands will remain quiet and the Resident, informed me on the 7th instant, that the further presence of a ship at Bushire, as a guardship, was unnecessary but desired that, a ship should remain in telegraphic touch.

Mo.23 of 27 June I have the lionour to forvrard Lieutenant Comander Shuter's report of his successful capture of the pirate Ghaithoo bin Jasin in a dhow on the pearl banks to the Westward of Das Island on the 4th instant. 'REDBREAST' arrived here on the 11th instant brirv^irvT the pirate under close arrest. The Liiy-ah Residency Aycnt and the Native Inforner were also on board. Their assistance was invaluable. The fate of the prisoner will be decided after the Resident's return fron Ahwaz. I have conmunicated with him with reward to the natter. 2.- The prisoner appears to have offered violent resistance which fortunately did not result in injury to anyone but himself. I beg to submit to your favourable notice the s:art action of Able Seaman Isaac Needhan who did not hesitate to close with the prisoner to wrest the axe from him and the prompt action of Lieutenant Blackman in quieting the prisoner when he a-nin became dangerous. The actions of this officer and man undoubtedly prevented serious casualties whilst effecting the arrest. I The Con lander-in-Chief Ships Vessels, EAST INDIES.I would Also submit that credit is due to Lieutenant and Connandor Stator in so speedily brin^nr the service to a successful conclusion. Had the pear line boats not been ordered to ro:nin at Dio Island on the ni^ht of the 3rd instant, it is probable thi Ghaithoo would have received warning from his frierris and the search would have failed. It is probable that the brothers will rake thei*- selvos scarce for some time now but it is to be hoped that they will eventually be traced and captured. 3.- I will inform you how the prisoner is disposed of.

Sir, In accordance vrith your orders of the 33rd ultimo, I have the honour to report that on the 2wth ultimo I left Jask for Linrah where I arrived at 5.0 p.m. on the 30th. I interviewed the Residency Agent on the 30th, and on the 1st instant the Agent, hia brother, and an informer, one Abdullah bln Yusuf Chiri, merchant of Lingah cane on board. At 10.0 a.m. on the 1st I wei^ied and proceeded to Pais Island, to try and glean information as to the where abouts of the ex-pirate Gaithoo. I arrived at ICais Island that day and landed the Agent. On the morning of the 2nd the Agent came on board and informed me that Ghaithoo had been kno n to leave in a Kais boat, and brought a description of the boat and name of the Nakoda, but the Pheikh Saleb of Gin,rack ?uid Kais did not know on which bank the boats were. The Agent wished me to rerain at Kais Island that day to watch events, as Sheikh Saleb had come across to Kais to endeavour to capture one Sheikh Mohamet Hussein, who had cone across from the mainland and given out that he was the new Sheikh of Kais Island, and that the Island belonged to him, Ti,o Senior Naval Officer During Persian Gulf Division,During tho forenoon Sheikh Saleb sent his tofancttea and attacked Itohaost Hussein and captured him, with the loss of two men wounded, tho enemy had two men killed. The Surgeon of r, REDBREAST ,, attended to the wounieu men and at 7.0 p.ra. that day I sailed for Das Island. On the way across a very strong shemal sprang up accompanied by excessive dust which rendered sights impossible. At noon on the 3rd Zirkuh Island was sighted right ahead. T cruised round Zirkuh Island and met one dhow diving, I boarded her and she informed me that the Eais boats liad loft three days before and gone to the westward. I then shaped course for Das Island but on the way close to larwein Island I sighted a floot of dhows, I closdd them and boarded the chief boat. I was informed that the Kais l)oats had left tlie day before, presumably for Das Island. I proceeded to Das Island and found a large fleet of boats taking shelter under its lee from the shoml. I boarded the chief boat and one belonging to the informer, I was informed that the Tr ais Boats wore still out diving to the westward of Das Island. I considered the Pearler’s suspicions had been aroused so ordered the boats to remain at Das Island until tho morning. At 4.0 a.m. on the 4th I proce ded in sea ch and at 8.0 a.m. I met a fleet of dhows, on inspecting the boats I located the one I was in search of.

Sir, In continuation of the First Assistant's letter No.1656 dated 13th July 1909, I have the honour to express my great gratification at hearing of the capture of one of the Taona pirates. Lieutenant Commander Shuter is much to be congratulated on the success of his quest - happily achieved \vithout damage to any of his own ship's^ompany. 2 . I have now the honour to request that in pursuance of arrangements decided upon between us in conversation, H.M.S. 'Redbreast' after taking on board the Residency Agent Lingah and his companions, may now proceed to Charek to endeavour to induce or frighten Sheikh Saleh to deliver the pirates if already apprehended by him, or to assist Lieutenant Commander Shuter to effect their capture. After doing what he can in this matter, I request that Lieutenant Commander Shuter will call at Lingah to drop the Residency Agent and thence proceed to Abu Thabi to deliver the pirate Gaithoo into his temporary custody. 3. I enclose letters for his use, addressed to Sheikh Saleh and the Sheikh of Abu Thabi as necessary, and a note for the Residency Agent Shargah in case his services are required. 4. Lieutenant Commander Shuter will doubtless use his discretion to reinforce the terms of my letter to Sheikh Saleh, with such potent verbal arguments of his own as may serve to bring the Sheikh to give effective co-operation; or if necessary for the same purpose any pearling boat found at 'ander Shirley Lifchfield, R.N.

I trust the presence of the 'Redbreast' was opportune and use ful to you and I am glad to hear that you were able to suppress the rebellious conduct of Sheikh Mohamed Hassan. Secondly, you have been informed by Khan Saheb Agha Bedr of the capture of Gaithoo bin Jasem the pirate by H„M.S. 'Redbreast' and the proved discovery of the fact that the other two sons of Jasim went to the pearl bajsks in the boat of your kinsman. You have already received the Residency Agent's letter of the 5th July 1909 (16th Jemadi 11) calling on you to arrest and hand over the pirates as in duty bound. You have doubtless arrested them by now and H.M.S.'Redbreast' proceeds to your headquarters of Charek to take over the persons of these pirates from you. Your relations with the Residency and with our Agent have been cordial in the past, and I trust that you will not fail on the present occasion. If you hand over these men, you may expect cordial British recognition of your proper action by the British Authorities. If you fail, then I must warn you that the Residency will not let this matter rest, and the British Government will not rest contented until these three pirates have been brought to justice just as the sons of Eumaidi were, and if you and your relations harbour them, you must expect to be regarded as pirates like them and the boats of you and your relations like the boats of pirates.

It is a source of gratification that the first business letter I address you after your accession is on a satisfactory matter. Regarding the long outstanding case of piracy on a Soudan boat by the people of Taona. Although the Persian C/Overnment has persistently declared that all the culprits are dead or disposed of, their statement has not been accepted and I have never ceased to cause a watch to be kept for these pirates. This season specific news was received from the pearl banks and A1 Hamd Lillah H.lvl. S. n Redbreast” has 'been able to capture one of the pirates. It is still hoped that the others m iy also be captured. Meanwhile it is necessary to keep the prisoner in a safe place and it is both inconvenient to keep him in H.M.Ship and also not advisable to hand him to a Persian Official. I therefore think fit to send him to you for safe custody by the Captain of H.M.S. ff Redbreast M . After handing him over to you and getting your receipt the Captain will leave and proceed to search for the other two. Doubtless many of your Soudan subjects can recognise the prisoners. Please sign and return the attached receipt paper so that I may know that you have received him. It is necessary that he should be kept in bonds, as he is a desperate man, but I rely upon you to see that he is properly fed and not ill-treated in any way. You will understand that I only wish you to keep him temporarily. If we cannot find his brothers in the next few days we will decide what punishment he is to receive and take him over from you.

WITH reference to Mr. Marline’s telegram No. 293 ot the 5th September last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Hushire, in regard to the murder ot Abu Thabi subjects by the inhabitants of Taona. In view of the fact that the murderers, who during the summer were at the pearl fisheries, have now retired inland, and that, as Major Cox points out, the chances of capturing them are now remote, J have addressed a further note to the Persian Government pressing for an early settlement of the question of compensation to the families of the murdered men, and, while informing Major Cox of the action I have taken, I am suggesting that the question of the punishment of the men still at large should be held over until the spring, when, if they should return to the pearl fisheries, an opportunity may be afforded for effecting their capture. A copy of the note which I have addressed to the Persian Government is inclosed herewith. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Major Cox to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Shiraz, October o, 1908. WITH reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram dated the 3 rd September, 1908, on the subject of the murder of Abu Thabi subjects by inhabitants of Taona, I have the honour to forward translations ot further reports received from the Residency Agent, Lingah, and beg your perusal of them. It will be noted, in the first place, that the doubtful identity of Saad (or Saeed)-bin- Abdullah has been set at rest, and that he appears merely to have intervened as a purchaser of a parcel of pearls, which he may have acquired in good faith ; so that we are hardly concerned further with him. In other respects Khan Sahib Agha Bedr’s recent investigations corroborate the information previously telegraphed, and indicate— 1 . That the three sons of Jasim are still alive and at large, in spite of the statements of the Persian Government to the contrary. 2. That Sheikh Mohamed-bin-Arahmeh Bushri, Zabit of the hamlet of Nakhl*i-Amir, Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Mohamed Bushri, Zabit of Taona, and the Sowlet-ul-Mulk, Governor of Bustek, one and all assisted the pirates at one stage or another, and directly or indirectly partook of the proceeds of the outrage. 3. That a fourth local Headman, Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Rashid Marzooqi, Zabit of the port of Moghu, has now to be added to the list of confederates, he being the present Overlord of the village of Nukhl-i-Amir, and having apparently accepted the responsibility of recovering from Mohamed-bin-Jasim the amount ot the bribe paid in Shiraz to secure his release. Of the latter development I shall speak later on. The hamlet of Nakhl-i-Amir, which, according to my information, is 2J farsakhs north-west of Charek and almost due north of faona, has hitherto been regarded and spoken of as being under Taona ; but in such unsettled regions it often happens that in the course of blood feuds or village quarrels a particular community \vill transfer its allegiance from one petty local Sheikh to another, according to the dilection from which, for the time being, it can expect the greater measure of practical assistance when in difficulty. Such considerations probably account for our Agent s present statement that Nakhl-i-Amir now looks to Moghu for protection. [2052 1] B' Not reproduced. 2 The lie of the neighbourhood in question will be apparent from the rough diagram given in the margin , 0 which is approximately on a scale of 16 miles to the inch. All the places named are included in what is known as the Shibkuh district, a tract which has been a frequently recurring source of trouble to the Residency in the past, owing to the fact that when any inconvenient incident occurs within it jurisdictional responsibility is invariably bandied about between the Governor of the Gulf Ports and the Governor-General of Pars, the district being directly under Shiraz for revenue purposes, but its coast-line nominally under the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The latter is usually afraid, in any case, to take any effective action there, lest he should thereby fall foul of the Shiraz Government. In his concluding communication the Residency Agent has recommended that, the opportunity for capturing the pirates at sea having lapsed, we should demand their surrender from the Sheikh of Moghu. At the time his report was written and up to now Bushire has been devoid of any effective authority, the Derya Begi, who might have co-operated, having been dismissed, and his successor, the Muazziz-ed-Dowleb, of whom I hesitate to expect much, not having joined the appointment. In any case, now that the brothers are back at their home inland, time admits of an exchange of views as to the best course which can now be pursued in regard to the case generally. Owing to the situation of Nakhl-i-Amir above described close to the maritime range and at some distance from the coast, the chances of His Majesty’s ships repeating the successful capture achieved last year at Bunder Rig must necessarily be regarded as problematical. On the other hand, an abortive attempt to capture them by our own dispositions would, it seems to me, be calculated to weaken your hands for pressing our claim for compensation at Tehran. It will be remembered that this case of piracy with murder has now remained unexpiated for six years, and while the expeditious capture of these pirates on the pearl banks, following on the capture of the Dayir pirates last year, would have operated greatly to our interests and prestige, yet the most important object from my point of view is that the compensation to Abu Thabi should no longer be delayed, and that a standing grievance, which has had a most prejudicial effect upon the attitude of the Sheikh towards the Residency and British subjects trading in his territory, should be laid to rest. Subject, therefore, to the conclusions to which a consideration of these papers may bring you, 1 am inclined to think our best course is to use the details at present brought into prominence as a basis for another insistent demand for the payment of compensation. The items to which I refer are : — 1. That the Shiraz prisoner Mohamed-bin-Jasim (of whom we have a photograph) has been allowed to escape. 2. That the other two brothers are also alive and back in their old haunts, in spite of the assertions of the Persian Government that they had been disposed of. 3. That the Sowlet-ul-Mulk, Governor of Bustek, and three other petty Sheikhs of the Shibkuh district have all been accessories after the fact, and have assisted the pirates and shared their ill-gotten gains. If the Persian Government will capture the men so much the better, but I would earnestly deprecate any pretended or real endeavours on their part to capture them being allowed to block our demand for the payment of compensation. I beg to be favoured with your early views or instructions after a consideration of these papers, of w hich I am forwarding copies to the Government of India. In conclusion, I beg to revert for a moment to the question of the escape of the Shiraz prisoner. Pending a decision as to whether we ourselves shall take any action in the direction of the capture of the trio, I have purposely avoided raising any question with the Shiraz authorities as to the whereabouts of any of them. There seems to be no doubt that Mohamed-bin-Jasim was in durance here at the time of my arrival in , June, for he had shortly before addressed an appeal to the Consulate begging us to agree to his release; but I have ascertained by confidential inquiries that he is no longer among the prisoners, and it appears that some two months ago, when His Highness the Zil-es-Sultan realized that he would not be permitted to retain the Government of Pars, he set free a number ol prisoners, among them Mohamed-bin- Jasim, His Highness’ underlings doubtless first taking substantial presents from the relatives ^)f the prisoners in cases where they could afford to pay. This explanation of the p risoner’s escape fits in chronologically with the information furnished by our/IM* 8 Lin gab Agent whose account of the financial arrangement on which his release was effected is in all probability the correct one. REFERRING to your letter dated the 12 th ( 22 nd) July, 1903, regarding the piracy committed by the people of the Taona port, residing at the Nakhl-i-Amir village, a dependency of the said port. The necessary inquiries made [by me] into the matter show that there are three brothers, viz., Ahmed, the eldest, Mohamed, the second, and Gheithoo, the youngest son of one Jasim, who belong by origin to the Bushri tribe, and who are relatives of Sheikh Mohamed-bin-Arahmeh Rushri, Zabit of Nakhl-i-Amir, and of Sheikh Abdullah- bin-Mohamed Bushri, Zabit of’ the port of Taona, and Headman of the Bushri tribe. These three men committed murder and plunder of the Abu Thabi subjects on the sea, and, after committing that deed, took the boat and the property of the murdered persons and came to Taona. Sheikh Mohamed-bin-Arahmeh, Headman of the Nakhl-i-Amir village, took possession of the boat belonging to the murdered persons, changed some of its planks and gear, and converted it into a fishing-boat for himself. The pearls belonging to the victims, which had been brought over by the murderers, were taken possession of by Sheikh Mohamed-bin-Arahmeh, Headman of the Bushri tribe and Zabit ot the Nakhl-i-Amir village, and he delivered the same to Mulla Ahmed-bin- Mulla Abdullah, Imam of the mosque at Nakhl-i-Amir, who again sold them at Lingah to Saad-bin-Abdullah Someiti, a diver residing at Lingah, who was mentioned by Mullah Shokrullah, for a sum of 1,500 dollars, and paid the amount to Sheikh Mohamed-bin-Arahmeh aforesaid. Sheikh Mohamed-bin-Arahmeh paid 500 dollars to the murderers and distributed the balance between himself and the Sowlet-ul-Mulk, Zabit of Bustek ; and something was also received by Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Mohamed, Headman of the Bushri tribe and Zabit of Taona port, but it is not known precisely how much was received by Sheikh Abdullah out of the 1,000 dollars taken by Sheikh Mohamed-bin-Arahmeh, or of the 500 dollars paid to the murderers. The Sowlet-ul-Mulk, Zabit of Bustek, subsequently gave orders for the three men’s arrest; and Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Mohamed Bushri, Zabit of Taona, thereupon captured the three murderers and made them over to the Sowlet-ul-Mulk at Bustek, and they remained in confinement for some time ; but all of the three men escaped later. The Sowlet-ul-Mulk’s Tofangchis went in their pursuit, and began firing upon them. Mohamed-bin-Jasim remained where he was in fear and was arrested. Several shots were fired at the two brothers, and Ahmed was hit, but Gheithoo escaped. Thinking that the person shot had died, the Tofangchis only took Mohained and kept him in confinement at Bustek. When night came on Gheithoo returned to the spot where his brother had been shot, to find out if his brother had died or remained alive. On reaching the place he found that his brother was alive, but was unable to walk, having received a bullet in Ids foot. He took him on his shoulder and remained in hiding on a mountain appertaining to Nakhl-i-Amir for a few days until his brother recovered. The Sowlet-ul-Mulk subsequently sent Mohamed-bin-Jasim as a prisoner to Shiraz, where he was kept in confinement. Saad-bin-Abdullah Someiti has no relationship with Sheikh Abdullah, Zabit of Taona, nor was he a participator in the piracy ; he merely purchased the pearls from Mulla Ahmed-bin-Mulla Abdullah Bushri, Imam of the mosque at Nakhl-i-Amir. Sheikh Mohamed-bin-Arahmeh-bin-Saleh, Headman of the Bushri tribe and Zabit of Nakhl-i-Amir village, is a cousin of Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Mohamed-bin-Saleh, Headman of the Bushri tribe and Zabit of Taona. Sheikh Mokamed-bin-Aiahmeh, Zabit of Nakhl-i-Amir, and Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Mohamed, Zabit of Taona, are both Headmen of the Bushri tribe, but have a grudge against one another resulting from I have, &amp;c.

It is not possible to obtain complete proof [to show] how much of the stolen property was received by Shiekh Mohamed-bin-Arahmeh and how much by Sheikh Abdullah-bin- Mohamed Bushri and others, because the persons having information are unable to reveal it for fear of the Sheikhs and the murderers; and they [seldom] say a little, and even that to the persons whom they may think trustworthy. Ahmed and Gheithoo, sons of Jasim, had proceeded to the pearl banks on the Sambook of Sheikh Salem-bin-Mohamed Al-i-Ali. But a quarrel having taken place between Sheikh M&gt;&gt;hamed-bin-Arahmeh, Zabit of Nakhl-i-Amir, and Sheikh Abdullah, Zabit of Taona, they returned from the pearl banks and went to Nakhl-i-Amir, and they had not returned [to the pearl banks] up to the 22nd August, 1908. I have heard that the divers of the Shibkuh ports finish their operations on the 12 th September, 1908, and it does not seem, under these circumstances, [sic] to take measures with a view to capturing the pirates in the pearl banks. I have received the photo alleged to be that of one of the persons concerned in the piracy, and am keeping it for the present as a precaution, and shall return it after having done with it. Inclosure 3 in No. 1 . Khan Sahib Agha Bedr to Major Cox. (Translation.) _ Lingah, August 25, 1908. WITH reference to this Agency report dated the 25th August, 1908, I have heard that Mohamed-bin-Jasim Bushri, Resident of the Nakhl-i-Amir, who was among the murderers of the people of Abu Thabi, and who was the brother of Ahmed and Gheithoo and had been sent by the Sowlet-ul-Mulk, Zabit of Bustek, as a prisoner to Shiraz, where he remained in confinement for some time, has recently arrived at Keis Island in a boom belonging to the people of Nakhl-i-Amir. According to the statement made by Mohamed-bin-Jasim to certain individuals at Heis, he had been tried about seven times at Shiraz while he was in prison, and he had answered during all of them that he had committed no murder and piracy; that on the last occasion he was taken to a certain place where his photo was taken ; that he was taken back to prison afterwards, and the Sowlet-ul-Mulk’s employe Amin Ghaffar Busteki at Shiraz paid 200 tomans and released him, and sent him to a [public] bath ; that he arrived at Bushire from Shiraz on foot in the beginning of Rajab, met Sheikh Mohamed Hassan of Keis at Bushire, went in his company to the Government House, Charburj, stayed there for a day, and came from Bushire on foot to Nakhl-i-Taqi, where he embarked on the boom chartered by the brother of Amin-bin-Ali, and came to the Keis Island and stopped there for one day with Sheikh Ahmed Mohamed Al-i-Ali, Zabit of the island, and then proceeded to Taona, staying there for a couple of days, and then leaving for the Nakhl-i-Amir village. Also, Zeinal Ghaffar, brother of Amin Ghaffar, has written from Bustek to Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Rashed Marzooqi, Zabit of Moghu, that Amin Ghaffar had lent a sum of 200 tomans to Mohamed-bin-Jasim Bushri, of Nakhl-i-Amir, at Shiraz [on the condition] that he [Sheikh Ahmed] should send him [Mohamed-bin-Jasim] to the pearl fisheries and so recover the amount.

Sir G. Barclay to Ala-es-Sultaneh Your Highness, Tehran, December lylSQS. I MA Y Hi the honour to address your Highness on the subject of the murder of Abu Thahi subjects by the inhabitants of daona, to which reference was made in conversa tion with your Highness by Abbas Kuli Khan on the 11 th instant. Your Highness on ^ ^ that occasion stated that if the note which the Persian Government had addressed H f to His Majesty’s Legation were referred to, it would be seen that the Persian Govern ment had done all that was possible in this case. ^ I venture to point out to your Highness that in their note of the 2nd May last the Persian Government, while unwilling to give the Governor-General of the Gulf Ports effective control over the whole littoral of the Gulf, undertook to do their utmost to maintain order in the district of Shibkuh, and to settle satisfactorily the various cases mentioned in Mr. Mailing’s note of the 7th April, among which was the case of the &gt;V Taona murders. “T' &gt; Since that date, however, nothing has been done, and it has, moreover, come to my knowledge that two of the murderers, who were stated by Mushir-ed-Dowleh in his communication of the 13th March, 1906, to be dead, are, in fact, alive, and have been seen at the pearl fisheries. These men have now retired inland to Nakhl-i-Amir. While expressing the hope that it may be found possible, by the assistance of the }al authorities, to effect the arrest of these men, 1 most urgently impress upon your Highness the necessity of giving effect to the repeated representations which have been addressed to the Persian Government by this Legation by arriving at a speedy settle ment of the question of compensation to the families of the murdered persons.

Sir:- Ji - r~o / ?/ c t** Foreign Office 3/ 1900. With reference to your letter of the 20th 'b relative to the measures to he taken to effect the capture of the men known to have been concerned in the Taona murders, I ; am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith, decypher of a telegram from His Majesty's Charg 6 d*Affaires at Tehran suggesting the procedure to be followed with this object. The suggestion contained in the last paragraph of this telegram (the reference in vtfiich should be to paragraph 124 and not 121 of the 2nd Edition of Wheaton’s 'International Law') would appear to be that the men should be treated as having been guilty of 'piracy jure and as such justiciable oy any Court before which they may be brought. The facts detailed in Mr. Grant Duff's of The Under Secretary of State, India Office.1906 would, it appears to Sir E. Grey, amount to piracy il there were any evidence to show that these particular crimes were part of a regular course of conduct practised hy these Taona men, or that the murders were committed and the ship seized with a view to committing depredations on all comers; hut the crime was committed in January 1903 (five and a half years ago), it was an Isolated act and there is no sug gestion that it has been repeated since, or that any attempt has been made to repeat it since* It is therefore probable that a prosecution for piracy would fail. In these circumstances it appears to Sir E. Grey to be inadvisable that any attempt should be made to send idle murderers, when seized, for trial in India. These men are not British subjects, the murders were not committed within the jurisdiction of tne Indian Courts, and the Indian Courts could not take cognizance of the case except as one of piracy. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that, though the seizureof the men by a British ship on the hanks would he a high-handed action, its justification would lie in the failure of the Persian Government during the last five years to bring the murderers to justice and obtain compensation for the families of the victims. It would have to he on that ground that the action should he defended if called in question. Mr. Marling is not sanguine that the delivery of the culprits to the Persian Authorities would result in their proper punishment and the payment of compen sation, and I am accordingly to suggest, for the con sideration of Viscount Morley, the advisability of adopting the alternative course of taking them to Abu Thabt, not merely for identification, hut for trial and punishment. In favour of this procedure I am to adduce the fact that even according to western ideas these natives of Taona would he justiciable by an Abu Thabi court, for their crimes were committed on the high seas on an Abu Thabi dhov; (cf. see o87 o± the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894), and if they were taken to Abu Thabi and detained there, blood money for uie relativesrelatives of the victims could perhaps he exacted from the Chief of Taona, who shared In the loot: and punish ment meted out by the Chief of Abu Thabi, or If this be Impracticable ^ the men sent back to Taona only when some satisfactory undertaking had been obtained that they would be properly tried and punished when they returned to Persian soli. It appears to Sir E. Grey that, as His Majesty's Government are the guardians of these truclal chiefs the seizure of the men by a British warship at the banks is a less high-handed action when It is ancillary to an intended exercise of Abu Thabi jurisdiction tnan when It is intended to hand them over to the Persian authorities, who might have dealt with them at an/ oime during the last five years had they chosen to do so, as they must during that time have been constantly within the Persian jurisdiction. I am accordingly to transmit to you herewith, draft of a telegram which, in view of the considera- tions above set forth. Sir E. Grey proposes, with Lord Money's concurrence, to address to Mr. Marling, pointingpointing out the course to he followed and requesting him to instruct His Majesty's Consul General at Bushire to proceed accordingly. The preliminary measures suggested appear to he satisfactory to effect the capture of the men. I am to add that Sir E.

Memorandum regarding Taona Murder Case by Captain A. P. Trevor, I. A., First Assistant Resident, Bushire. Directly he could get an opening, Sheikh Zaeed opened this question. He was very earnest on the subject. I explained to him what had been done, but he appeared very dissatisfied. He seemed to think that for some reason he was in the Resident’s bad books, I assured him this was not so. He said that when he had made similar com plaints on previous occasions, he had immediately received redress, and that this case had been dragging on for 3 years.I endeavoured to explain to him that matters were delayed by an ineffici ent Government in Shiraz, but he did not understand this. He said that a large number of the Abu Thabi people were complaining against him for referring cases to the Residency, as they said no result was obtained, and that some threatened to leave Abu Thabi and settle in Katr. He said this particularly applied to the Soudan tribe, some of whom live at Abu Thabi and some in Katr. The murdered men in this case were of the Soudan tribe. These men are perpetually pressing him to be allowed to go over to Taona one night and exact what reparation they can and then go back and settle in Katr. Sheikh Zaeed therefore earnestly requested that the case may be settled as soon as possible. He says he is particularly anxious to speak to you on this matter and he fears that somebody had been poisoning your mind against him and he feared you may be annoyed with him. I assured him that neither was the fact. He said however that he requested permission to be allowed to come up and see you and ask whether you would let one of our ships bring him up sometime when convenient. He said he had things to say which he would rather not commit to paper. This case looms very large at Abu Thabi just now and it is hard to get them to talk about anything but this, and cases of dispute with the Belgian Customs. It seems very desirable therefore to press this case as much as we can.No. 265, dated Bushire, the 16ch (received 26th) June 1905. From— Major P. Z.

With reference to the other two matters mentioned in His Excellency the Viceroy’s telegram, namely— ( 1 ) restoration of the Sheikh of Abu Thabi’s arms ; ( 2 ) the claim of the Shargah Chief’s uncle to a date garden at Lingah, I have the honour to report that in the first case, the arms were duly restored by the Customs in August 1903.

Cox, Officiating Puli deal Resident in the Persian Gulf, To Sir Arthur Hardinge, K.C.B., K C.M.G., His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. I have the honour to invite Your Excellency’s attention to the case in which 4 Arab pearl fishers, subjects of the Trucial Chief of Abu Thabi, were murdered in their dhow by their employes, inhabitants of Taona, on the Persian Coast near Charak; concerning which case Your Excellency was last addressed by my predecessor in his despatch No. 10-S.A., dated*23rd July 1903. A brief resume of the events and correspondence in connection with the case is enclosed herewith, from which the various stages which the matter has passed through will be apparent. As I fear Mr. Grahame’s unremitting efforts are not likely to have any satisfactory result I am obliged to ask Your Excellency to take the matter up. There is much feeling about the case at Ahu Thabi, and naturally so, and Y r our Excellency will I am sure agree that our prestige as guardians of the Maritime Peace, and our duty towards the Trucial Chiefs whom we prevent from taking the law into their own hands in such cases, imperatively demand that adequate justice should be meted out in the present instance. I would add that this seems to be an occasion in which we may well quote our recent action at Bahrein in exacting substantial reparation on behalf of oppressed Persian subjects. I gather from the Sheikh of Abu ThabPs attitude that the reparation which he looks for is some visible deterrent action such as the execution of the murderers as well as compensation for the dhow and the pearls stolen, but satisfaction in the former direction is now rendered in a great measure out of the question by the incidents reported in the precis attached. Thus out of five persons concerned in the murder, four appear to have been handled by the local authorities. Of these— one is said to he now in prison at Shiraz; one is at large; one is said to have been shot dead at Bostak; cme is said to have died in prison at Shiraz.2 Under these circumstances perhaps Your Excellency will consider the question of our asking for an indemnity from the Persian Government, leaving it to them to recover it from the people of Taona or not as they think fit. 1 he amounts which have to be considered in assessing such an indemnity would be— («) Blood money for 4 lives at Ts. 1,000 each ... =Ts. 4,000 (5) Value of pearls claimed by Shaikh of Abu' Thabi on behalf of the murdered men’s families and other pro perty, $3,000 ... ... ... r=Ts. 1,500 (c) Value of dhow. ... ... ... (d) Claim of British Indian Subject, Its. 800* ... =Ts. 350 (•Perhaps it might be considered equitable to deduct this amount, when satisfactorily proved, from the value of the pearls.) I am sending a copy of this communication to the Government of India in continuation of previous correspondence. Precis of proceedings and correspondence in connection with the murder of Abu In January 1903 the Trucial Chief of Abu Thabi represented to the Politi cal Resident, Bushire, that four of his subjects of the Sudan tribe had taken their dhow as usual to the pearl banks during the previous season, and had there taken into their employment for the season 5 other men, all of whom were residents of Taona, and three of them were brothers, natives of that place and cousins of its Shaikh. Their names were said to be— It was alleged that the fact that they had had a successful pearling season caused the 5 employes to have evil designs and they accordingly killed the four Sudanis, took everything that was in their possession, and went away to Taona, scuttling the dhow before landing. Here the 3 brothers gave their kinsman Saad-bin-Abdulla, Chief of Taona, the pearls valued variously at from Rs. 2,000-0-0 to Rs. 3,000-0-0 which was part of the plunder; the Chief thus becoming a co sharer in the loot. The other 2 men were reported to have taken no active part in the murders. In May 1903, having failed to get the local authorities to take any effect ive action, my predecessor addressed His Majesty’s Minister on the subject, and reported the matter to the Government of India in his letter No. 88 , dated 22nd May 1903, paragraph 3. Subsequently on 9th June the Government of India included mention of the casein their telegram No. 1243-E. of that date to His Majesty’s Minister. On the 22nd June 1903, Sir Arthur Hardinge telegraphed to Colonel Kemball that the Grand Vizier had ordered an enquiry to be made into the circumstances of the murders. On receipt of this the Salar-i-Moazzam was again addressed and he finally said that Taona was under the Kawam-ul-Mulk, and suggested that the matter should be brought to the notice of the Ears Government. Accordingly, on 24th July 1903, His Excellency the Ala-ed-Dowleh, Governor-General of Ears, was addressed and asked to give orders for the neces sary enquiry and for justice to be done. Total «Ts. 6,320 Thabi subjects by persons from Taona. Mahomed Geith Ahmed JHttMf 3 After much delay, the Kawam-ul-Mulk replying on 10th November 1903, transmitted a copy of a letter from the Deputy Governor of Bostak, saying that he had detained the persons accused of the murders although they had denied the charge. He suggested that the Abu Thabi Chief should send a represent ative to meet the accused in the Shera Court at Bostak, and promised to execute the orders of that Court. ^ On 18th November 1903, a claim was preferred by some British Indian subjects on account of a sum of Bs. 800 said to be due to them by one of the murdered men, and about the same time, it was reported that of the 3 men in custody at Bostak, one had made good his escape, another had been w ounded, and the third shot dead. No reply being forthcoming to the communication addressed to the Nasr- ed-Dowleh, His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, was asked in January 1904, how it was proposed to settle the claim. Writing in March 1904, His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, stated that the Nasr-ed»Dowleh proposed to defer moving in the matter until the new Governor was appointed or the Ala-ed-Dowleh confirmed. In May 1904, Mr. Grahame stated that as the result of repeated representa tions, the Nasr-ed*Dow leh had told him that the accused men would be brought from Bostak to Shiraz for trial, and requested that representatives of the murdered men and of the traders having claims, should appear in Court at Shiraz. It having been pointed out, that owing to the expense and difficulties involved, it would be difficult to guarantee the presence of witnesses at Shiraz, Mr. Grahame asked the Nasr-ed-Dowleh at the instance of the Resi dency whether authenticated depositions before the Shara Court at Abu Thabi could not be accepted at Shiraz. The Nasr-ed-Dowleh only gave an evasive reply however. The Chief of Abu Thabi was then addressed on the subject, and as antici pated, he replied that it would be difficult for witnesses to proceed to Shiraz, but that their sworn statements could be sent duly certified. On 30th January 1905, His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, was asked to approach the Nasr-ed-Dowleh again and endeavour to obtain redress. In reply, Mr. Grahame forwarded a copy of a letter addressed by him to the Nasr-ed- Dowleh, in which he urged that although one of the Taona men had died in prison at Shiraz, this was no reason for delaying a settlement, and that the Kawam-ul-Mulk should now he moved to exact blood money from the men of Taona and compensation for the stolen property. The Nasr-ed-Dowleh accord ingly suggested to the Kawam-ul-Mulk that a collective indemnity should he extracted from the inhabitants of Taona in settlement of Abu Thabi claims. Writing on 22nd May, the Chief of Abu Tbabi addressed the Resident complaining that no redress had been given or vengeance exacted upon the culprits who had been .guilty of disturbing the maritime peace. The idea of settlement by indemnity alone did not seem to satisfy him but he said that with regard to the question of compensation, the value of cash and pearls plundered had been $3,000 or more. Matters have again come to a deadlock by a recent intimation to Mr. Grahame from the Kaw'am-ul-Mulk to the effect that it would be unjust to levy the proposed indemnity from the men of Taona for an occurence which took place at sea and in which they had no part. He further contends that Taona is not able to pay such an indemnity, and that before ho could exact such, an order from the Persian Foreign Office or the Governor-General of Pars, would be necessary. Mr, Grahame replied that however harsh it might seem to exact a collective indemnity, it would be an injustice which His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate, that subjects of a State under its protection should be plundered and murdered at sea by Per sian subjects and that no indemnity should he accorded. Mr. Grahame then suggested that if the Taona people could not he made collectively responsible, it might perhaps he possible to raise an indemnity by instalments from the relations of the murderers and from the authorities to whom Tuona is entrusted. There the case stands at present. O. C. Press, Simla.—No. 490 F.
