Mr. Ballantyne, in the course of a conversation to-day, referred to the Koweit Neutral Zone and said that the discovery of oil in Koweit in Hasa bad increased the interest of the intervening territory. His Company might before long wish to secure a concession in the Neutral Zone, over which they had optional rights in respect of Ibn Saud's share. The plan he had been turning over in. his mind was that the Calarabian Company should obtain a concession from Ibn Caud, and that a British Company should be formed by association between the Standard Oil Company of California and British interests (who would not , he said, be the Iraq Petroleum Company) for the purpose of obtaining concessional rights from the Sheikh of Koweit. Nothing definite had been decided yet, but he hoped that when the time came for an approach to the Sheikh we would be helpful to his Company and not take the line that competition with a Company which was already in the field could not be permitted. I made no comment. (Mr. Ballantyne was referring, of course, to the situation on the Trucial Coast, about which he had previously asked me (a) whether there was yet any opening for the Standard Oil Company (b) whether there would be any opening for another British Company, e.g. a Company formed in association with American interests. I replied in the negative to both questions and Mr. Ballantyne said nothing further on the subject.)

REFERENCE TO PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE: Description of Enclosure. ”NAME'&amp;*DATE 5 SUBJECT IT Report on a visit to Kuwait by 3 Mr. Noonan. 5 (Received under British Middle jj East Office complimentary slip * No. PD/54 dated 4.7.’47) £In the course of u*y visit to Persia, I managed to slip in a quid: trip to Kuwait* On Monday, -*arch 17th ? I left Abadan by A ,1.0*0 ♦ plane at 8 a .il. and returned five hours later. This gave me barely four hours on the spot but, such is the cofiipactness of the Kuwait Field, that even so short a tiiLe suffices to give one a fair grasp of the layout and operations• 2. I was met by Donald Campbell, seconded from Abadan as Administrative Assistant to the Field-Superintendent* The latter is ifrtrldfcf of Gulf GJLI 4 whan I ajriAvau ht just off to an audience with the 'Rular', but he found time to give me a broad picture of the production storage and loading set-up, Y/hich was usefully rounded out by Campbell in due course. 3. I also met de Hemel, Personnel Manager, a keen young Britisher with a most engaging personality, and every appear ance of being the right man for the Job. 4. Campbell then took me by car to Achmedi (about 20 miles south of the City of Kuwait) which is in the beginnings of its development as the industrial centre of the field and the residential area. There are no roads - in the strict sense of the word - but the desert surface is hard and viable for even heavy vehicles. Campbell Is an evident - and indeed self-avowed - lover of Kuwait, the sort of man whose influence and sympathy could hardly be better engaged; he beguiled the Journey with a well-informed discourse on the place and its inhabitants, end proved altogether an admirable guide. 5* The population of the Sheikhdom is some 90.000 souls 1 apart from the pastoral Bedouin, they are essentially a ship building, -seafaring folk whose main activities have been hitherto the carrying trade to the Malabar Coast and India, and the pearl-fisheries of the Persian Gulf. Both these trades are run cooperatively, the crews being tied to the owners by debt and sharing the profits if any. Pearl-fishing has been hard hit by the 'cultural” industry. They strike the stranger as a contented, unspoilt, self-reliant people, and one can but hop* that the development of a vast oilfield at their very door will enric their lives without debauching them. Insh'allah. sea-level - one commands a comprehensive view of the 'Burghan Hills” field about ten miles away to the westward, and the loading terminal on the foreshore some five miles in the other direction. Burghan 'Hills” is a misnomer for they are just a group of low contours - wells themselves being lower than Achmedi and the oil having to be boosted up to the storage there*— • At the ti&amp;e or uy visit, there were so^e ei^ht producing wells; but 72 iiiore In project, • Production was currently 46,000 barrels a day; and 150,000 barrels the target for July 1948, In other words, they aiu* to step up the annual production rate froiL 2,000,000 tons'to 7,000,000 tons in the short space of fifteen months. IF they can only get the materials. 9* i*ain crude storage is at Achmedi - about.80.000 tons, i.e. equivalent to about 14 days 1 current production. Oil from this storage flows down a 22 M gravity line to the load ing terminal. There are two loading berths (submarine pipe- hLiafc £a buoysoas Tar rJLaad mid aiie fox the abb* Loading _ rate is nominally 1,100 tons per hour. Berthing difficulties due to weather are frequently encountered end, all in all. it is evident that th.eir tanker loading arrangements will call for considerable development to cope with the vastly greater production they have in view. LABOUR ♦ 10. There is no adequate pool of local labour to draw on and none at all for skilled or semi-skilled work. They are, therefore, recruiting both artisans and labourt?rs in Inaia, and Chisholm, their Personnel Manager in London, whom I have since met on his return from a visit to India, seemed to find lots of room for improvement in recruitin; methods, which it can only be hoped will be gone ahead with; for it seems to me that proper selection at source and proper conditions of employment at xZuwait will bear not only on the efficienty of their operations, but on the integration of the oil community with the people of Kuwait which they ought to strive for. HOUSING and A^.MIII^ . 11. Circumstances will oblige the Kuwait Oil Company to provide permanent quarters and amenities for all their people - general labour Included. The lay-of-the-land at Achmedi is something of a gift for the town-planner - a gentle horse-shoe slope to sec . war( 3 that should lend itself admirably to spacing, terracing and drainage, e n ^ I must say that, from what I heard on the spot and have since heard from Chisholm, a good deal of imagination has gone into their long-term planning for it. One can only hope that time, hands and materials will permit of this social development going hand-in-hand with industrial development. 12. In the short-run, however, they have a major problem on their hands of making shift to accommodate not only artisans and labour for permanent construction but a small host of .incoming drillers. 13* Water is another of their problems: there is brackish well water for industrial and some domestic purposes, but drinking water is brought in tankers. Some sort of cistilla- tion plant is envisaged as the long-run solution. For building materials, concrete blocks, air-spaced, are being made on the spot from imported cement. Sm;,.:-'™/,/TN &amp; 14• The Kuwait field seeias to have got away to a flying start and, judging by their confidence In their ability to treble production in short order, the 15,000,000 tons per year figured for 1950 looks well within range. The deciding factor will be the procurement of oilfield material, the slowness of which may well check their progress over the next two years* 15. Proximity to seaboard is a great natural advantage? but open beach loading has decided disadvantages here and whether the provision of adequate tanker-loading facilities can be kept in step with increasing production is another *m*ttcr. The projected trunk pipeline will obviously make all the difference to the optiaiuiL' exploitation of the Kuwait field. 16. They have what looks to me like a unique opportunity to build up a model field community? and by enlightened coopera tion with the local authorities to make it an integral and beneficent factor In the life of the Sheikhdom. c a 1 a 0. loth hay, 19*7• E .(i.
