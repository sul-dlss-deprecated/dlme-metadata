LL.U * 'i P(|REIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1 12th October, 1932. ^ i f rj.% My dear Gilbert, ft? With reference to your letter No. P.Z. 3376/32 of July 12th, regarding a certain case brought against a British Indian in the Persian Courts, and to the correspondence with the Tehran Chancery, of which we sent you a copy on August 17th, about the deposit of security in Persian legal proceedings, I enclose for your information the accompanying copy of a further letter from the Tehran Chancery on the subject. The following, as you will see, are the main facts emerging from this correspondence. (1) The version of the Persian law of September, 1929, published in the Tehran newspaper ,t Messagerde 'Teheran 1 ' (enclosure No.2 in Clive’s despatch No.486 of September 21, 1929) was incorrect. The alternative version from the 'Sitareh Iran' (enclosure No.l in Clive’s despatch) was more accurate. J.G. Laithwaite, Esq. ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY L^ER ! NO, S&amp; 2 : 2 our. 1932 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE(2) In these circumstances, there is no ground on which we could claim from the Persian Government reciprocity as regards defendants (as distinct from plaintiffs or third parties). We have, however, suggested to the Tehran Chancery in our letter of August 11th that we might possibly point out to the Persians what the practice is in the United Kingdom and in India and enquire whether they could not see their way to afford us reciprocity. The Tehran Chancery, in their latest letter of September 9, do not say whether the Minister has decided to approach the Persians on these lines. We do not propose, however, to ask that anything further should be done, since, as far as we can see from here, there is little to be gained by approaching the Persians on the question. Beckett tells me that the question is one of those which are normally dealt with in Civil Procedure Conventions, and, as you probably know^we are, for obvious reasons, letting the idea of the negotiation of such a Convention with Persia remain in abeyance.

We regret that we never went further into the question as to which of the two contradictory texts which we sent you under cover of our despatch No. 486 of September 21st, 1929, was correct. We now enclose a literal translation of the official text of the law from which you will see that the version published in the Sitareh Iran was correct, i.e. it refers to plaintiffs only. As stated in paragraph 5 of our letter of July 1st the law regarding defendants applies to Persians and foreigners alike. Yours ever.

(3 BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. May 30th, 193?. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 40(10/9) of the 15th April last I have to inform you that the Rules regarding Security for Costs from Foreigners which formed the subject of this Legation Circular despatch No. 4 of the 13th March, 1931 refer only to suits in which the foreigner appears either in person or by attorney as plaintiff. 2. In the case cited by you the foreign subject is the defendant in a civil suit filed against him by a Persian plaintiff and it is not under these Rules that the Judge could require security from the British defendant. 3. He could however, on the demand of the Persian plaintiff for a guarantee or some security, require the defendant to produce bail that he would enter an appearance if called upon to answer the claim or that he would not remove from the jurisdiction of the Court his distrainable assets. This judicial act is known as ’tamin - muda abeh* and is in some measure equivalent to the French practice of a ’saisie conservatoire’. It is equally enforceable against Persian or foreign subjects. 4. In the case mentioned it is open to the British defendant to enter an appeal against the Judge’s order. I am, etc., (Sgd.) R.H.

If you think it worth while, would you kindly ascertain from India whether the practice there with regard to re quiring a defendant to give security is the same as in England?

INDIA OFFICE J.C.Walton, Esq. , C.B. , M.O(S P486/, 486/34) POHEIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 7th June, 1932 My dear Hoare, We have receiTed through the India C ffice a copy of Daly f s despatch to you No.40 (lc/9) of April 16th, about he order passed by a Persian judge in East Persia that a British Inuian nfiined Gurbachan Singh, vho had had a ease filed against him by a Persian, should lodge substantial security pending a decision. You have presumably long ago replied to Daly and will probably have pointed out to him that the Persian regula tions which he quotes apply only Then the British Indian concerned is a plaintiff, whereas Gurbachan Singh in this case was a defendant. It may however be useful to you to know that in • ngland (and I expect in Inula too; a defendant is never asked to give security in any circumstances unless he R.H.Hoare, Esq., C.M.G. brings&amp; 'brings a eounter-claia f v^hlch is not a mere defence but in reality a separate action in v.hich he is in the position of a plaintiff. In the present case, there was no counter-claim, and if reciprocity is the basis of Persian law on this subject Ourbachan Singh should have been Immune. I am suggesting to the India Office that it might be worth while finding out from India whether their practice is as in England. When we get their reply, you may perhaps think it desirable to try to persuade the Persians to issue some regulations about defendants. G. W.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 16 of 12th April 1932. A British Indian subject Curbachan Singh residing at Birjand has a case filed against him by a Persian partener named KARABAGHI. The Peace-Court judge passed an order requiring Gurbachan Singh to lodge substantial security pending decision of the case. The defendant drew the attention of the judge to the Notifications of the Ministry of Justice No.644 and No. 1441 (translation forwarded here under your Circular No.4 of March i3th,193l) and maintained that as he was residing in Persia and had in fact been in Persia for several years, he could not be called upon to lodge security notwithstanding the fact that he possessed no immovable property inside Persia. The judge expressed himself uncertain on the point but stated that having made the order he could not rescind it without the sanction of higher authority-meaning presumably that the defendant would have to go to the expense and difficulty of appealing against the order to the court at Meshed. I must confess that the meaning of the rule seems to me to be obscure, viz* If the British Indian defendant is not residing in Persia and does not possess immovable property in Persia how can any Persian court contrive to get cash security from him ? If the defendant is, in Persia at t&gt;he time the suit is filed against him, can he be said to be * resident* in side His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran.inside Persia when he possess no residence or immovable property? The object of the Persians is presumably to stop foreigners from disappearing, or making away with their assests pending decision of a suit filed against them. This being so, the question of ’Residence' only serves to complicate matters ~ a defendant 'residing* in Persia but owing no immovable property, can d ulte concei- vably(if he can obtain an exit visa)disappear into India. The ambiguity hinges on the word 'and'in the sentence. If the claimant (being a British Indian subject) resides outside Persia and does not own inside Persia etc' If the word 'of' be substituted for 'and* and 'resides* be held to mean that he is present in the country and owns a residence in itself ample security in the suit, the ambiguity would not exist. I have been unable to advise Gurbachan Singh in this particular case and would be grateful for instructions as to the interpretation of the Persian Rules, for future guidance.
