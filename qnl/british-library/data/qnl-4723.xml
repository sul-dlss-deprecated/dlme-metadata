C ONFIDE NT IaI PARLrJflENTARY and HiF3-5 ^E/TpAIGN for th. REVISION of the A1IGL0- IRAQI TRE.fTY OF .ALLIANCE of 1930* The first recent public reference to the need'for a revision of the &lt;,nglo-Iraqi Treat;/- appears to have been a report &gt; in the issue of ''ash-Sha ! b r for 1 8 th November 1944, of an interview given to that paper by IIWUL Pasha al-HAIDARI lately returned from the Iraqi legation in XONDONc The reporter asked what was H*M,G 1 s reaction to MUSTAFA NAHKAS Pasha ! s proposal for the amendment of the 4 *ngio-Egyptian treaty and v/hether D^V/UP Pasha did not think liaq v/ould be right in her turn to demand the revision of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty* DAWUD Pasha replied that he thought any attempt to amend the existing Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (which was being main- lined by both parties in letter and in spirit) would be most inopportune c . It was ,: ash~Sha ! b M again that on 21st January reported a suggestion by the extreme Nationalist deputy MAHMUD RAMIZ in the Majlis that the treaty should be revised. There the matter remained until on 22nd March Sir KINAHAN CORNWALLIS conveyed to the Regent K.B.LMs oral message which induced the phrase ''The policy of H.M.G. towards Iraq ......... will continue to be guided by the letter and the spirit of the treaty which has conferred such great benefits on both parties' 1 . This evoked from : an„Nida ? ' a leading article on the following day. The Iraqi public according to this journal, had always been critical of the provisions of the present treaty whioh in any case is agreed to have been only appropriate to a particular phase (now concluded; in the development of draq. King GEORGE T s message should encourage the Iraqi government to initiate negotiations for revision* dsh-Sha'V’ returned to the attack on 8th April, seizing the occasion of Sir HUGH STONEHEWER-BIRD 1 s arrival to say that the new Ambassador was expected to see that relations between Great Britain and Iraq corresponded to the wishes and aspirations of the two nations on a basis of equality. The paper added that the structure of the post-war world made it essential that both sides agree without delay to the amendment of the Treaty. This article was rather roughly handlea by the censor c 1 Al-Iraq' had joined in with an unimportant leader on the same subject on 5th April, and a full scale press camraign looked imminent. In fact however the subject dropped out of the headlines until 1st May when 'an-Nida” stressed the necessity for amending the Treaty and reconsidering the military, commercial and financial agreements_ associated with it. On 5th May a fourth paper 'al-'Alam al ! Arabi n took up the question of Iraq's demands which_apparently included the revision of certain political and economic agreements which would secure to Iraq the right to large sums of money for the benefit of her exchequer., In the following day the same paper wrote a little less cryptically that with the end of hostilities the 1 Iraqi people wished co air their views and that tneir first desire was the full and absolute sovereignty of their country in the political and economic spheres* 2.

The last reference it may be inferred was to the agreement not actually incorporated in the Treaty whereby England appoints an .jnbassador to BAGHDAD while Iraq is represented in LONDON only by a Minister; and whereby Iraq undertakes not to employ other than British advisers, so long as suitable British personnel are fortneoming^ MAHMUD RAMIZ and AHM«D al-JALILI likewise called^for treaty revision (though without going into any detail) in the course of the same debate; and MAHMUD RAMIZ is known to object to the clauses in the Treaty permitting the passage of British troops through the country, and also to the existence of the n.A.F* Levies recruited from among the inhabitants of Iraq* 3 # By the time British forces intervened in Syria an 'anti-imperialist' campaign was therefore already under weigh and the extreme nationalists who had reluctantly held their tongues for the past three years, having seized the opportunity offered by the Syrian affair to voice their old opinions, shev/ed no disposition when the immediate occasion was passed to return to their earlier silence. In the press 'ash-Sha b on 7th June again referred to treaty revision considering this subject should be discussed at the meeting of the Arab ^ e ague n and was supported by another left-wing paper 'ar-Ra f i ul- «mm . The ball was then played back into the parliamentary court and in a speech on 14-th June. the Shi l a Senator f ABD ul-^uIDl described treaty revision as the first of the two mam planks of Iraq 1 s foreign policy Shi’a Senator advocated and f ABD ul-MUHSIN SHALLASH another :aution in raising this matter, in a speech on 1?th June, and was promptly taken up by the Shi'a paper 'as-Sa’a' which charged him with gross weakness; with the result that at the next Senate meeting on 19tn June ul-MUHSIN was at pains to emphasise that he was in fact strongly in favour of seeing the Treaty amended. On 19th June also \ABD ul-MAHDI referred to the matter again, expressing gratui- cation at the Prime Minister’s statement of 17th Jo the effect that he considered the Treaty must indeed he amended but that this must await the end of the war with Japan* In rms connection the newspaper ,? ad~Diyar' given earlier by th-o Prime Minister Cairene 'Akhir Sa 5 a' in which he is the matter of the two British bases cleared up by the new World Security reprinted an interview to a reporter of the reported to have said that in Iraq would no doubt be scheme« and that the only , e a. HU. one* o ^ other grounds of disagreement such as the status of diplomatic representatives were matters of secondary impor a Interest /-* I * 1 1 4F ^ Page 3» 4. Interest in the future of the Treaty was by this time fairly generally roused. n An-Nida n and ^s-Sa ^ 11 alluded to it on 24th Junes and on 26th June the M Iraq Times ’ 1 sprang a mine in the shape of a delphic paragraph provided by Reuters with the following text ;~ 'IR4Q MAY ASK FOR REVISION OF TREATY. The Iraq Government is considering asking the British Government for a revi sion of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930% which regulates relations between Britain and Iraq for 25 years from the date of the • Treaty. No approach for revision will, how ever ? be made by Iraq until the country is in a position to make use of further material and political assistance in its development . 11 ^ 5 # A considerable upheaval in the *.rabic press duly followed. In the view of f, an-Nida M the ’Iraq Times” is the mouthpiece of the British Government and 28th June saw besides casual references to the Treaty in n al-Hawadith” and ^as-Sa’a” the first instalment of a long article in ,r an-Nida”, on the urgent need for revising the Treaty before the conclusion of the war with Japan. This was continued as a serial in four successive issues and although n an-Nida” printed on 29th June an official denial that the ’’Iraq Times” notice was inspired by any government the excitement did not die down. On the 30th ”al~Akhbar” and 2al-Iraq” took up the theme, 30th June being the anniversary date of the Treaty’s signature 5 and on 1st July it was handled not only in ”an-Nida’s” serial but by ”al-Akhbar” and ”ash-Sha»b” as well. On 2nd July ’’ad-Diyar” and on 3rd July ”al-Iraq” printed further articles and finally on 4th July ”al- 3 ilad” came out with the first instalment of another serial feature on the Treaty. The origins of this press campaign, apart from the ”Iraq Times” articlo, may perhaps be sought in the paragraph in the gossip column of ”as-Sa’a” on 24th June stating that the present Prime Minister HAMDI al-PfiCHACHI was expected to be the ’hero’ of the revision of the Treaty. It is due to the ^ desire of the various factions to outbid one another in nationalist enthusiasm. It will be noted that the really energetic advocates of treaty revision have been, throughout, n an-Nida” the most right-wing of BAGHDAD papers, and ”ash-Sha b the most extreme representative of the left. 7 Amid the deluge of comment the chief thing that emerges is that ”an-Nida”, ’’ar-Ra’i ul-’Amm” and 'al-*Iraq” are openly of the opinion that Great Britain will be more amenable to pressure while she has the war with Japan on her hands tnan she will be afterwards. As for the matters requiring rectifi cation the only detailed discussion of the Treaty and related agreements is that of NUR ud-DIN DAWUD of ’’an-Nida” anc. he lists the points at issue a£ follows:- y (a)/-&gt; V* » &gt; /* Page 4. (a5, Provision for the defence of Iraq or the maintenance of protected British Lines of Communication is rendered obsolete by the LorId Security scheme and clauses making such provision should be done away with. In accordance with the SAN FRANCISCO charter the only foreign troops which will be maintained on another nation's territory will be those placed there by a decision of the Security organisation. (b) • Quite apart from this the existing legal and financial concessions in respect of British Forces in Iraq have resulted in certain Iraqi merchants being put out of business through insufficiently investigated slanders. This is an encroachment on the civil rights of Iraqis which should not be allowed. (c) . The exemption of British Military imports from customs dues has deprived the Iraqi treasury of a considerable revenue. This is a one sided arrange ment which should cease. (3). The clause whereby Iraq should provide guards for R.A.F. installations has not been properly applied. The R.A.F. Levies should be abolished. (e) . The question of identity of training and methods between the British and Iraqi armies should be the subject of consultation with other Arab countries* (f) . The clause dealing-with transport facilities for British Forces does n#t make it clear that the British Government should pay for these facilities. (g) , British ships should require the approval of the Iraqi Government before they may enter the Shatt al- ! Arab. It is not enough that the Iraqi Government should know that they will enter it. oo. Iraq should be able to have ambassadors in LONDON and WASHINGTON. (i) * The ‘’foreign 1 ’ direction cf the Iraq State Railways must cease, and the fate of BASRA port must be settled in a manner campatible with Iraq’s national independence. 8 * The quality ‘*f NUR ud-DIN DAWUD’s political thought is notoriously not very high, but he is closely connected with JAMIL al-MADFA‘I and the views of his paper therefore carry weight in BAGHDAD. CICI Baghdad* 5 Jul y 1945.Appendix to C.I*C,I.Paper CICI/TP/l/JO/A dated ?th July, 194J. NOTE: This Appendix is SECRET and its contents Should not he reproduced without reference to this Centre * One of the reasons for the move to amend the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and associated agreements is the dis satisfaction of the Americans with the arrangement whereby their diplomatic representative in BAGHDAD is necessarily of lower rank than the British Ambassador, Among those most sensitive to this was Mr, LOY W. HENDERSON who arrived in BAGHDAD as U # S, Minister accompanied by his Latvian wife in November 1943 , He continued to hold the post until March 1945 when he was transferred to WASHINGTON as Director of the Office of Eastern and African Affairs in the State Department, The issue together with that arising from the similar situation in Egypt is unlikely to be raised in any acute form until after the war but the American view cannot be considered a closely guarded secret, 2 # In the autumn of 1944 the Iraqi Government wished to strengthen its diplomatic representation in LONDON and WASHINGTON in connection with anti-Zionist propaganda and NURI Pasha as SA 1 !!) was considered for the LONDON post. He was not prepared to go if he must be inferior in rank to his Egyptian colleague, who by virtue of Treaty arrangements is an Ambassador 5 and the Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested that the treaty letters might be amended to enable NURI Pasha to be appointed with ambassadorial rank. This suggestion was not well received by H.M.G, There was no particular objection to bringing Iraq into line with Egypt by agreeing that her repre sentative in LONDON might be an Ambassador and this could have been done by a simple exchange of notes. But to alter the Treaty letters in this particular would certainly have led the U*S,A* to open the whole question of Britain^ privele;ed diplomatic position in Iraq and Egypt, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was accordingly persuaded not to press tne point* 3 # The Iraqis were naturally not very pleased at this outcome to their approaches and the question of diplomatic representation is therefore an actual one in a way that the existence of a base at HABBANIYA or the R.A.F, Levies are not. But since the Iraqis have strong reasons for wishing to bring the first question up again sooner or later they have been casting about for other points which might usefully be brought up at the same time.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000021_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/640</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000021</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/640</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 25/4 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, 1930’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1930/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-04-16T11:19:33</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (18 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.
