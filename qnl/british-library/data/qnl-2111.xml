BARNES.V.— Military Matters. 52. There is nothing important to report. /f- VI. —Naval Matters. 53. H.M.S. “ Dahlia ” arrived in Jedda on the 25th April for the visit usually made at the pilgrimage season and remained over the end of the month. The visit was a great success and afforded an opportunity for discussing various matters with Commander R. H. Jackson, who, to the regret of everybody, was visiting Jedda for the last time before giving up his command. Nothing that passed in these discussions calls for special record. There were no other naval visits, British or foreign. ‘54. His Majesty’s Government announced in March their decision regarding naval salutes for Hejazi dignitaries. Apart from those given to Royalty, the only salutes to be given are as follows :— 55. Information was received in March regarding personal conversations between Captain Dicken, Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, and Admiral Deville (January-February report, paragraph 50), when they met at Port Sudan, from which it emerged, of course quite unofficially— {a) That the French asked the assent of the Hejazi Government to all visits to Hejazi ports, including Jedda; (b) That they took less rigid views than His Majesty’s Government of salutes and were willing to accord them whenever they thought they would give pleasure; and (c) That they were indifferent to measures for the repression of slave traffic in the Red Sea. Guns. Ministerial heads of fighting services Governor of Jedda Governors of other ports ... 17 13 7il Kerim Ghuznavi (paragraph 67). Some little freedom of speech ana mucn diversity of thought prevailed at those banquets, many of the guests at which are far from seeing eye to eye with Ibn Saud. This particular evening is said to have ended in a certain atmosphere of politico-theological malaise. 59. Pilgrims suffered some hardships owing to the effect of the exchange crisis (paragraph 5) on prices. Some of the poorer were hard hit by a regulation suddenly introduced on the 3rd April, compelling foreign pilgrims to hand over- their travelling papers to the Jedda agents of the Mecca pilgrim guides in order that they should be sent to the guides at Mecca to be held by them until the end of the season. When this regulation was introduced an attempt was made to apply one of its articles in such a way that pilgrims should not come themselves to their Legations or consulates. The British Legation successfully resisted this, but was unable to get round the provision that pilgrims should be deprived of their travelling papers. The effect of the new* regulation is to convert these into a sort of pledge for the payment of sums payable to the guides by way of remuneration or in respect of taxes for which the guides are in turn responsible to the Government. Sir A. Ryan made strong official reservations and reported the matter home for instructions. 60. Otherwise this unusually small pilgrimage presented few special features. The use of cars between Mecca and Arafat, which caused much confusion last year, appears to have been somewhat severely controlled. There were no reports of the circulation of forged Indian notes (January-February report, paragraph 51, and previous reports). 61. The smallness of the pilgrimage reacted on the number of ships in port at Jedda, but the traditional “ Haj Regatta,” revived in 1929 after an interval of several years, was successfully held on the 30th April. His Majesty’s sloop “ Dahlia ” and eight merchant ships, all British save one, took part. 62. Arrangements were made by the Legation with the commander of the “ Dahlia ” to enable Moslem naval ratings to make the pilgrimage, as a small number had done in 1930. This year no fewer than twenty-two Somalis, employed in H.M.S. “Dahlia” and “Endeavour,” which was at Port Sudan, took advantage of the arrangement. 63. ' Advantage was taken of the visits of Major Thomson and Mr. Champion (paragraph 66) to discuss inter alia certain pilgrimage matters, notably with Major Thomson, the question of the West African pilgrims.

Dear Eyan, ',7e nave given careful consideration to your letter of the 27tn November last, written from Marseil-ies about tne question of naval salutes for Hejazi dignitaries, and have come to tne conclusion that the only safe and proper course is to adhere c.s closely as iossiole to tne general principles explained in the Admiralty letter of tne 8tn July last of which you nave had a copy. This means tnat no salutes can be given to lejazi Ministers as such unless they are the neads of C 'ervice Departments, wno are provided for in category (c) of tne Admiralty letter. ;Vnile fully appreciating your desire to please tne hejazi authorities we can see no sufficient justification for treating them better tnan persons of corresponding status in otner countries. Having entered into relations witn tne Hejaz to tne full extent connoted oy an excnange of Envoys we think tnat in all formal and ceremonial questions like tne present one they should be content to be treated on the same footing as otner countries with which we nave similar relations, and tnat if the general practice were explained to tnem they ought to be able to receive the decision witn appreciation ratner tnan otherwise, the implications uei ng wholly flattering to tneir national susceptibilities if not to disappointed individuals. It does not seem necessary to anticipate that the French and Italians will go outside tne general international practice as indicated in the -admiralty letter, and we would prefer/ Sir Andrew Eyan, K.h.E. , C.M.G.prefer to assume for the present that their ships will observe the same principles as our own where le.jazi Ministers are concerned. Should they not do so you will no douot let us know in order that we may consider what can be done to guard against further irregularity. The salutes to be given as and when occasion arises may therefore be expected to be as follows Ministerial heads of fighting services 17 guns governor of Jedda 13 guns Grovernors of other ports 7 guns As regards the third paragraph of your letter we do not think that tne Admiralty would admit that a naval visit to a foreign port without the previous consent of tne foreign (rOvernment would not be in accordance with international practice if the intention to make the visit had been notified to that Government in advance. Yours sincerely, (Signed) G.R. WARNER. P.S. The foregoing was written oefore the receipt of your letter No. 431/553/1 of February 17th in which you suggested that the question might stand over until raised by the Hejazi Government. It seems better however to let you know the general position without delay, and I am therefore sending this letter on to you unaltered. (intld.) G.R.W.MMMBHI 7- Copy* No* 75.

I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) R. G. Howes. 4 The Secretary of the A&lt;&lt;foi \ no. no. JEDDA, May 9, 1930. / s Sir, I have the honour to state that I have given careful consideration to the question of naval salutes for Hejaz dignitaries, which has formed the subject of correspondence ending with Foreign Office despatch No.121 of April 24th last (T 4372/12/377). I have 44scussed the matter fully with Commander Jackson, R.N., of H.M.S. M DAHLIA' and with Mr. Bond. Thd former was good enough to show me various regulations on salutes in general and on the practice in other ports of the Mediterranean station. He concurs generally in the suggestions which I shall make later in this despatch, although they must naturally be regarded as definitely committing myself only. 2.- Before approaching the general question I may say that Commander Jackson had been authorised to use discretion, in consultation with Mr. Bond, as to giving the Governor of Jedda a salute of thirteen guns, if occasion arose during the present visit of H.M.S. :I DAHLIA'. We all agreed that this should be done, should the Governor go on board, a matter which is doubtful, as he has gone to Mecca for the pilgrimage. As regards the general question, I find that there are various special salutes on the Mediterranean Station, which would appear to Justify by analogy a standing arrangement to give the Governor His Majesty f s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.governor of Jedda a salute of thirteen guns on future occasions also. Thus the Prefect of Marseilles, though not strictly entitled to a salute # gets that number. So do certain local Governors in Spain, ’’Nomarchs” in Crete and the Governor of the Suez Canal, Thirteen guns does not seem to be an abnormally high number of guns for a local Governor ofimportance, if saluted at all. It is true that we are anxious to give the most favourable treatment to the present Governor, partly on personal grounds, but the importance of Jedda, as being the principal port of the Hejaz, the port in which all foreign interests including the pilgrimage are concentrated and the diplomatic centre, is such that even if the present Governor were succeeded by a lesser personage, the maintenance of the thirteen gun salute need not be considered anomalous. 4.- There remains the question of other salutes. Royalty being already provided for, this falls to be considered under two heads, viz (a) other dignitaries of the central Hejaz Government and (b) Port Governors other than the Qaimaqam of Jedda. As regards (b), it is to our interest that our ships should be welcome on occasion in the minor ports and be this might/facilitated somewhat, if the local Governors were assured of honour, but there are not the same reasons for big salutes. We might perhaps fix in principle nine guns for the local Governors of v ejh, Yanbo and other ports, exclusive of Jedda, to be increased to eleven, if the military (or any recognised equivalent civil) rank of the Governor justified it.5* Occasions under (a) would very seldom arise, so far as can be foreseen at present* I think that it would be well to provide in principle for a full salute of seventeen guns for any member of the Hejaz Government being the titular incumbent of a Ministry and thirteen funs for any such person in the position of Acting Minister* I realise that in making this proposal I am straining analogy rather far,as it is rare, if not unknown, to provide salutes for all cabinet ministers* At the same time, I feel that there are special considerations connected with this place, which may be adduced in favour of such a rule* One has to reckon with local inability to appreciate distinctions which are made easily in more advanced countries and with the effect ©f personal jealousies* Thus, under my proposal* the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Fuad Harass, would get thirteen guns. it i s not very likely that he would have occasion to visit one of His Majesty's ships officially, but, if he did so and received no salute, he would take umbrage all the more because the Governor of Jedda, with idiom he is on bad terms, was entitled to thirteen guns* 6.- If these proposals should be adopted at home, with or without modification, I would suggest that I be authorised to make known the decision of His Majesty's Government to the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, not officially but as a matter of courtesy, adding that any rule adopted would be of a provisional nature and that, while prepared to adopt■mvpmbhhbi adopt a special procedure in present circumstances, it might be necessary ka at some future time to adopt a more restrictive practice, having regard to what is done elsewhere. It would perhaps be well to let me see how the Acting Minister reacts to such a communication before formally embodying the rule in station orders. At the same time I hope that, in the event of another naval visit to Jedda before the question is finally settled, the same treatment may be accorded to the Governor of Jedda as is contemplated in the present occasion, should the Governor return in time to return Commander Jackson^ official visit. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) A.

The 7 \0. consider that no alteration of the practice is necessary so /£' far as^Hedjaz is concerned and they do not propose to participate in the Conference. This seems to rna^ce a Conference superfluous. Any questions regarding Zanzibar, Iraq, Transjordania and Zuscat can be settled by ordinary correspondence. Zanzibar is a British Protectorate and its ruler, therefore, cannot be a foreign sovereign. The treatment of the King of Iraq and the Emrair of Transjordania and their families depends on the exact status of those territories, which is a question for the 0.0.; rulers in ordinary mandated territories could hardly be foreign sovereigns any more than those in protectorates, but presumably the King of Iraq at least is a foreign sovereign, since his country is now regarded as no more than 'quasi-mandated”. The present position in Muscat is anomalous because the Sultan is recognised as a foreign sovereign but on the other hand the salute Provisionally sanctioned for a member of his family is only 13 guns, but there does not seem any sufficient reason for disturbing existing arrangements which, so far as we know, give satisfaction, unless and until the royal family of Muscat notice that they are being differently treated from that of tlajd. The protected Gulf rulers, though their territories are not technically Protectorates, need/need not, it is suggested, be regarded as foreign sovereigns for the puroose of salutes any more than the rulers of Indian states. The general Question of discrimination be-tween Eastern potentates and others in the matter of saluting i the members of their families, who may be very numerous, : solves itself to a large extent, because in proportion as such rulers become modernized the number of their consorts^and consequently of their descendants, will tend to decrease; on the other hand the royal families of tV more old-fashioned rulers are not so likely to aopear in Public on ceremonial occasions.

Dear Warner, Your letter of November 28th (T 12709/249/377) on the suoject of salutes to be accorded to members of Ibn baud's family. I do not feel that there is any need for restriction as the number of occasions on which salutes of this nature can be accorded is already strictly limited by circumstances. The Aing wisely avoids Jedda as much as possible as do all members of his family. His visits are rare and of short duration. The visits of the sloop are also infrequent. Thus only on the rarest occasions is it physically possible for a member of Ibn baud's family to be accorded a saluce. Nor, even when an opportunity occurs, is any son or brother of the king likely to visit a sloop except at the direct invitation of the Commanding Officer. In these circumstances the size of Ibn baud's family would appear to have little bearing on the question. I believe however that the number of his sons does not exceed ten of whom several are still infants. As circumstances preclude the possibility of an excessive number of visits being paid by members of Ibn baud's family, it does nos appear necessary toto make special regulations restricting salutes to be accorded on these occasions.

In accordance with his reading of the instructions, the Commanding Officer of .11.S. H Clematis' recently gave two salutes of 21 guns to a party consisting of Ibn Saud’s brother, four of his sons and a nephew, who visited the ship at Jeddah. This was done after consultation with the British Consul and Sir G. Clayton and may have been politically desirable, but, as the Commanding Officer observes, the practice is likely to prove expensive if continued, in view of the number of Ibn Saud’s wives (said to be 149) and children (at least 40). The Admiralty and Foreign Office suggest that a decision in the Ibn Saud case will apply by analogy to those of the rulers of Iraq, Transjordania, Zanzibar and Muscat, and as. for the views of this Department. The Government of India have an interest so far as the question concenis uscat (where the Sultan gets a royal salute, but the President of his Council of Ministers when a member of the ruling family only gets 13 guns). The Colonial Office have suggested an inter- Departraental conference on the subject. A draft telegram to ascertain the Government of India’s views is submitted, together with a draft letter to the Colonial Office, agreeing to participate . ■Sf. in/in a conference. (Sgd.) J.C.

If mors prBcisG rulss on 1*1118 subjGCo Ccin be laid down with any advantage (which seems to me somewhat doubtful) it must presumably be by confidential instructions as to the interpretation o- trie published regulations, and not by their amendment in public. The Admiral apparently suggests that a discrimination should be mado against ’Eastern Potentates , in ^iiat, v/hile they themselves should get the salute of 21 gan^ authorised for 'Foreign Sovereigns and members of their families', the members of their families should geo no salute at all. Such discrimination would be difficult to cover by amendment of tne published regulation^. Presumably it could not be applied to tire umperor oi Japan; and any public ruling would be likely to give offence to the King of Afghanistan, however much he may deserve to be included in tme expression mastem Potentate'. But it might be useful to consider whether confidential instructions could with advanwage oe issued on the two questions - (1) what 'Eastern Potentates' should be treated as coming within the description of 'foreign, sovereigns' for saluting purposes, -here must be many cases, like that of the fheikh Oi nahrein, Ox rulers who 7 though no douot foreign sovereigns of a, sort, are by common consent not treated as entitled to the salute of 21 gons; (2) where Eastern rulers are themselves recognised as entitled to 21 guns, how uneii families are to be treated. But/mmmmmssrntmmmmmmmmmmmm Minute Paper. POLITICAL Department. But I should doubt whether it is worth while to attempt to deal with (2) by precise regulations. However many wives and children Eastern Potentates may have, they are not likely to trouble saluting officers very often, and rigid instructions might only cause difficulties. A good deal might be left to common-sense. /a k h *mniunications on this subject be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l. u., Jhe following Number quoted: 47 350/28.

An interdepartmental conference for producing an agreed procedure for all cases is proposed and later deemed unnecessary.Later correspondence discusses which Hejazi dignitaries should be accorded gun salutes and how many gun salutes they should receive. A scale of salutes approved by the Admiralty in March 1931 states that ministerial heads of fighting services should receive seventeen guns, the Governor of Jedda thirteen guns, and governors of other ports seven. The correspondence also discusses whether the same number of salutes should be given to governors of ports in Yemen.Correspondents besides those from the Admiralty and the Foreign Office include the following: Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean; His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan); the British Agent and Consul, Jedda (Hugh Stonehewer Bird); the Viceroy of India; officials of the Colonial Office and the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
