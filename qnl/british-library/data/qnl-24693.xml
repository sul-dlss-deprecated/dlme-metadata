The detachment of the 19th Punjabis which, in accordance with previous orders had started in relief and proceeded as far as Nushki, has returned to Quetta’ The railway charges on account of the move of this detachment from Quetta to Nushki and hack amounted to Rs. 1,398.

Please refer to your telegram of 14th May 1909^ approving of accom- niQdation for two coinpauies at Robat being improved at cost of Rs. 6,500, divisible equally between home and India. Occupation of posts at Robat, bam dak, and Kacka in greater or less strength will be necessary for some years to come both to drive arms traffic further west and thus add to its difficulty and also to protect and foster trade which is beino- attracted to Quetta by the Nushki route. Contingencies which may arise fiom the political conditions in Persia are also important factors requiring the piesence of tioops. Heat, however, in these places during April and May Q ^ e i} and at all times the surroundings are of the very worst. Racha being least unhealthy of these places, we are concentrating the detachment there for nine months of the year, redistributing them as circumstances require between the three places during three remaining months when the gun-running season is at its height. In order to preserve health of tioops and to mitigate hardships inseparable from climate and to lessen unpopularity of service in this locality, we consider it essential that pi opei accommodation should at once be provided at Kacha at a cost of approximately Rs. 61,000, employment of civil labour being considered advisable. Subject to proper estimates, which are being called for, we ask your Lordship s sanction by telegraph to the accommodation being provided at once.19 th Norm her 2909 In reply to r.

During 1910-11.—Home, Rs. 1,67,000; India, Rs. 3,28,000; 9,68,000; India, Rs. 9,75,000,; Rs. 19,43,000. Grand total, Rs. 24,38,000. Estimate of January showed total cost in 1909-10, Rs. 3,09,000, and for 10 months in 1910-11, Rs. 34,40,000; total Rs. 37,49,000. But if reduced to eight months basis during 1910—11, estimated total cost would have been Rs. 31.52,000. Latter total exceeds revised estimate now given by Rs. 7,14,000. This difference accounted for as follows :—Present estimates for 1909-10, more by Rs. 1,86,000, and for 1910-11 less by Rs. 9,00,000. Increase in 1909-10 chiefly due to larger issues of imported coal and stores used on works for Royal Indian Marine and other vessels, and increased hire oi transport animals. Decrease in 1910-11 chiefly due to reduction in requirements of coal, smaller subsidy, reduced charges for launches and less contingencies and Army charges, partly counterbalanced by increase in expenditure on stores and wireless telegraphy in Persian Gulf. We assume that revised estimate will cover at least a portion of cost of preparation of the Royal Navy vessels for the operations which we under stand was intended to be adjusted at home—-see India Office letter, dated 13th April last to the Admiralty—but we will communicate with you further on this point. total, total, l170 Telegram P., No. 32 C., dated (and received) the 27th July 1910.

With reference to the remark in Bushire printed Diary No. 463 for May 1910 (received 2 nd July) to the effect that it was suspected the k* is. ««Cheruskia ” had transhipped 500 rifles from Bahrein to Dilwar, I have the honour to state that the movements of this ship were very suspicious. She was originally expected to come here from Lingah about the same time as S. S. “ Kasara ”, viz., about the 5th May. On her way here, the “Kasara” noticed a Boom with flare lights near the Shah Allum shoal. _ On approaching the Boom and enquiring what was the matter, a reply was given that nothing was the matter and the S. S. “ Kasara proceeded. As Mr. Gregson was travelling by the “Kasara” to Bushire, I omitted to enter this fact in my diary. 2. The tt Cheruskia ,, afterwards came down here from Bushire, wnic seemed a very out of the way course to take for Basrah, and when I told tlie Company’s Agent in ordinary conversation that I thought this was a stupi method of procedure, he replied that it was done to save time, as the tides would not permit them to cross the Basrah bar for two or three days. 3. Should this transfer of arms take place, it must happen at night, a® the probable method is for a Tangistani Nakhoda to take d^ctshipmentfrom the steamer, and go straight across without landing the arms first at Bahrein. 4. On arrival of S. S. “ Parthia ” Sheikh Esa sent a if d ”ent the night, but nothing of a suspicious nature took pla® e - He was t two boats, hut apparently afterwards he thought one boat would suffice. 6.- I will continue to watch for such transhipments, hut cannot help thinking they would preferably transfer near the Persian coas .Telegram, No. 733 E.-A., dated the 7th April 1910.

Course you propose of continuing naval activity with avail able ships seems best in circumstances, and is approved. As regards telegraph staff between Robat and Bam, it seems necessary, in view of opinion expressed in Barclay’s telegram No. 15, to withdraw Dehaneh staff temporarily to Koh-i-Malik Siah. Please arrange accordingly. No objection to temporary retention of troops at Robat, or to reinforcement, if necessary, of escorts for telegraph staff along coast, but timely notice should be given if reinforce ments are sent. L' UFrom Viceroy, 6th January 1909. (Repeated to Tehran.) Foreign Secret. Anns traffic. Afghan caravans have commenced operations, and anticipation of future restrictions as result of Arms Conference will probably stimulate present activity. Local officers despair of successful results with totally inadequate forces at our disposal, and advocate military cordon along Mekran coast or effective naval blockade, or both. The political and financial objections to use of troops on Persian territory, or to any great naval activity in and near Gulf, are strong. But inaction would certainly be misunderstood in Afghanistan, and probably in Persia, even if it did not prejudice our case at Arms Conference and our position towards Persian Government. We have some information that owing to naval activity and increased risk last year prices of arms have risen at coast. Simultaneously, increase in supply has lowered prices in Afghanistan and along the frontier. The more the trade is harried the less profitable it will become. Moreover, inaction now will create greater difficulties later on. We have come to conclusion that naval activity should be continued with the force available, although only two ships will be available in the Gulf for all purposes until early in March, owing to “ Lapwing” having been withdrawn to refit, and the Admiral considers seven would be necessary for effective action. McMahon considers that telegraph employes on central line will be in danger of attack if we interfere with Afghans, and suggests withdrawal to Bam or Robat of staff stationed between those places and temporary retention of ordinary garrison at Robat We consider that telegraph staff should certainly not be withdrawn, and urge that Persian Government should take steps to protect them against all risks. Present force should be kept temporarily at Robat. W 7 e gather from Cox that with operations on the scale contemplated there is no risk to telegraph staff along coast. If necessary we can arrange reinforcement. It has guard of 30 Mekran levies.1 ° No. 12 of 1909 . GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To Thb Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Fort William, the 28th January 1909, My Lord, ( / P 0 (tf We have the honour to refer to our despatch No. 186 (Secret- External), dated the 22nd October 1908, in which we stated that we were prepared, with certain reservations, to withdraw the double company of Native Infantry which was posted at Robat in 1906. 2. The military authorities have now drawn our attention to the un satisfactory nature of the accommodation provided for the troops at that post, and have recommended that the existing quarters should be improved and extended, and that summer quarters should be constructed tor the detachment in the hills at Kacha. 3. In view of the possibility of the Robat detachment being withdrawn, we do not consider that, in present circumstances, any expenditure on construction of summer quarters would be justifiable. The question o improvement of the existing lines is, however, on a different footing. Whet er it is decided to abolish the Robat post as a permanent arrangement or not, it seems probable that contingencies arising from political conditions m eisia, or measures connected with the suppression of the arms traffic, will periodically demand the presence of troops at that station. The experience of the past year has shown that in the unhealthy climate of Rohat it is impossible to mainm.u the health and morale of the detachment with the accommodation now available, and we agree with the military authorities that it is desirable that alterations to the quarters should be canied out without y 4. It is estimated that the rough shelters in which the detachment is at present accommodated, and which were ^tructed wit ^ 60 as to at a cost of Rs. 1,000 approximately, can be improved : provide adequate and sanitary lines for the troops whic n, i y _ time he posted at Robat, at an expenditure not exceeding s. ,6. We therefore propose, with Tour Lordship’s approval, to convey sanction to this expenditure, which is not, in our opinion, excessive, and which wo assume should, in accordance with the decision contained in Your Lordship’s despatch No. 92 (Financial), dated the 5th July 1907, be borne in equal pro- portions by the Indian and Imperial Exchequers.

With reference to Sir E. Gorst’s letter of the 30th January 1906, regarding the measures to he taken in connection with the outbreak of plague in Seistan, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to enclose, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter from the Government of India regarding the incidence of the cost of the double company of Native Infantry now stationed at Robat. The Government of India, it will be seen, takes the view, in which the Secretary of State for India in Council concurs, that, the object of the despatch of these troops to Robat being to secure the lives and property of British officers and subjects in Eastern Persia, the extra cost incurred should be divided between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers in the same manner as other charges connected with the Diplomatic and Consular establishments in Persia. The total extra charge up to the end of 1906 was Rs. 1,25,000 (8,3331. 6s. Sd.), and a monthly expenditure of Rs. 10,500 (TOOL) will continue to be incurred, until the troops are withdrawn to India. I am to express the hope of the Secretary of State in Council that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will submit the claim of the Government of India for the favourable consideration of the Loids Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, as he finds it impossible to justify the incidence of the whole chaige upon the ie\enues of India.

'Sir, Annex. Foreign Office to Treasury. Foreign Office, 14th February 1907. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, copy of a letter from the India Office regarding the incidence of the cost of a double Company of Native Infantry of the Indian Army now stationed at Uobat, on the Perso-Baluch frontier. , At the commencement of last year the state of unrest and the anti- foreign feeling that prevailed in Persia, and especially m the North and Eastern provinces, gave rise to apprehensions for the safety of British residents As the Lords Commissioners will observe from the corre- spondence now enclosed, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran was instructed to concert with the Government of India and the Consul- General at Bushire the best means of ensuring that a force should be available, in case of necessity, for despatch to Tehran or any other part of Persia with the least possible delay for the protection of the lives and property of British subjects. Owing to disturbances at Meshed, and m anticipation of similar disorders in Seistan, the double Company of Native Infantry was moved from Quetta to Pobat m February 190b, and has since been retained there as a precautionary measure. The Secretary of State for India and the Indian Government are of opinion that, the object of the despatch of these troops to Robat being to secure the lives and property of British officers and subjects in Eastern Persia, the extra cost incurred, viz., 8,333L 6s. Sd. up to the end of 1906, and a recurrent monthly expenditure of TOOL until the force is withdrawn, should be divided* between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers in the same manner as the charges connected with the Diplomatic and Consular Establishments in Persia. Sir E. Grey hopes that their Lordships will give their favourable consideration to the claim now advanced by the Government of India, and in the event of the liability being accepted by the Imperial Govern ment, I am to enquire from what vote such expenditure should be met, as it cannot properly be charged to Diplomatic and Consular funds. The Secretary to the Treasury. I am, &amp;c., Enclosure No. 3. War Office to India Office. No. 0164/2327. (F. 1.) War Office, London, S.W., Sir, ' 29th May 1907. I am commanded by the Army Council to acquaint you that they have been informed by the Treasury that it is proposed to charge to Army funds half the extra expenditure involved in the movement of a double Company of Indian Native Infantry to Robat on the Perso-Baluch frontier. The Council, to whose knowledge this matter is now brought for the first time, have agreed, with the sanction of the Treasury, to accept liability for half the out-of-pocket extra expenditure incurred in consequence of the troops being temporarily stationed at Robat, on the understanding that the amounts to be thus shared shall not include any charges for furlough of troops after returning to India, pension in respect of the period of service on the frontier, or other “constructive” items of cost. It is understood that about 10,000L extra was so spent up to the end of the financial year 1906-07, and that extra expenditure is continuing at the rate of about TOOL a month. The latter figure would appear prima facie to approximate rather to the whole normal cost of a doubleOompany of Indian Native Infantry, but tlie Government of India will be able to state whether these figures are correct, and if so how they are arrived at. It is important for financial reasons that the War Office share of the amounts spent to the end of 1906-07 should be repaid to Indian revenues and brought to account in this Department before 30th September next, and I am therefore to request that the Government of India may be urged by cable to render an account of as much of the expenditure as practicable at the earliest possible date.

To The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India Simla, the 22nd October 1908. My Lord, ^ In Yonr Lordship’s telegram of the 30th March last, on the subject of the reinforcement of the Robat post by 500 men as a precautionary measure in connection with the illicit traffic in arms from the Persian Gulf littoral, you suggested that, after the trouble was over, the question of the further maintenance of the Bobat post should be considered. We now have the honour to forward a copy of correspondence on the subject, as noted the enclosed list. 2 The special reinforcement of 500 men which was sent to protect the Robat post in April last has already been withdrawn and the question now to be decided is whether it is still necessary to retain the double company of Native Infantry, which was posted to Rob at in 1906. This force, as Your Lordship is aware, was originally despatched as an escort to ^ reser '.j ° h and ammunition, which was required for the British Consulates at Meshed and Seistan, and with the object of affording protection ‘ ' corseauence Ul of such be necessary. It has since been retained at Robat in consequence ot disturbances in Seistan and other events, which seemed to render it desirable to have a British force located on the Perso-Baluch border. the It withdrawal has now been discussed with our Political Officers in Baluchistan and Seistan, whose opinions* are given m will be observed that, while Major Kennionf deprecates the withdrawal in the present state of Persian politics, Sir H. McMahon $ sees no ob jection to it, provided that certain arrangements are made for the force which it may be necessary to send to the P ^ arrangem e n t s and for improving the conditions on th ^ or seheme§ for the defence § Enclosure No. 4. of the Seistan Consulate are under separate consideration, and our orders will be icported to *^ U Meanwhile, we do not consider it necessary to delay our decision on tne question of the retention of the troops at Robat. 4 The main factor to be considered is the safety of the Seistan Consulate. On this poXwhile attaching due weight to the considerations mentioned by 3. The question of its * Enclosures Nos. 2 and 3. attached correspondence, f Enclosure No. 3. J Enclosure No. 2.2 * Maior Kennion, we are of opinion that in the present condition of affaire in Seistan no serious danger is to be apprehended from the withdrawal of the garrison from Robat. The maintenance of troops at this insalubrious post is, moreover, most detrimental to their health and efficiency, * Enclosure No. i. an( j m iiitary authorities represent* that it will in future he necessary, if the post is still to he retained, to relieve the troops half-yearly—an arrangement which would involve considerable extra expense. 5 . In these circumstances, we are prepared to withdraw the double com pany from Robat at an early date, provided that His Majesty’s Government will aoree to the increase of the present consular escort from 30 to 45 men, as recom mended by Major Kennion.f On learning + Enclosure No. 3. that Your Lordship concurs in this pro posal, we will submit a report as to the extra expenditure involved, which will, of course, be considerably less than that incurred in the maintenance of the double company at Rohat. 6 . We do not propose at present to take any action on Major Kennion’s proposals to increase the number of the Chagai Levies stationed at Nasratabad or of those now maintained at Rohat for the reinforcement of the Consulate. 7. We notice that in a recent letter^ to the Foreign Office Mr. Marling has expressed the opinion that, so far as j No. 184, dated the i5th July 1908. ^ armg t ra ffi c i s concerned, the presence of a double company of regulars at Robat during the arms traffic season only would probably suffice to prevent caravans entering British territory.

I think Robat escort might well he withdrawn as far as concerns safety of British subjects in case of purely local disturbances, provided that steps had been taken to improve to furthest possible capacity the Seistan Consulate and Birjand Agency. But I do not think the suggested change at present advisable considering the critical state of Persia as a whole, the possibility of a general rising and the valuable political effect the presence of troops at Robat undoubtedly has. The steps alluded to above would be Consulate defence scheme as submitted to the Government of India^) the augmentation of escort to 45 to provide for Birjand, and the increase of the Chageh Levies to thirty (half could be dismounted). I would also advise hundred, if proposed withdrawal is carried out.

From—The General Officer Commanding, 4th (Quetta) Division, To—The Quarter Master General in India. With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 716-B., dated 5th November 1^07, I have the honour to request that the question of the future retention of the Robat Escort furnished from this Division may 2 . The detachment originally proceeded to Rohat as an escort to arms and ammunition for consulates at Seistan and Meshed, and on arrival at Robat was “ temporarily retained ” on account of local and frontier disturbances. 3. A detachment has now been furnished at Robat since April 1906, the disturbed state of the coutry being given as a reason for their retention when ever the question of withdrawal has been put forward ; and as from information lately received from the Political authorities there seems to be no immediate prospect of any change in the condition obtaining in that district, it would appear that the withdrawal of the troops is improbable for some time. 4. The nature of the climate, scarcity and indifferent quality of drinking water, and scarcity of local supplies, all combine to make service at this out post very detrimental to the health of the troops employed there. 5. I attach a statement showing the general health of the detachment since first arrival at Robat from which it will be seen, that at the end of six months, the percentage of sick becomes permanently large. 6 . I consider that if it is probable that this detachment will he required to remain at Robat for any further considerable period, i.e., not less than 12 months, that it should be placed on the same categorv (for relief purposes only) as all detachments furnished from this Division/and its regular relief at intervals of six months be sanctioned. 7. This will mean a recurring annual charge of Rs. 9,400, hut I consider that this expense is well wortk incurring considering the gain in efficiency that number of Chageh Levies available for reinforcements being raised to one be referred to the Poreign Department for consideration and favour of early decision. 2will accrue by the troops being returned to Quetta before they become in capacitated for active service. In the case of the detachment 128th Pioneers, the percentage of deaths was 5 ; 12 deaths occurred on the return march and 46 were admitted to hospital immediately on arrival at Quetta. In the present case (127th Baluch Light Infantry) in ^ addition to malaria and dysentery, scurvy has also set in, in spite of anti-scorbutic measures. This attack is ascribed by my Principal Medical Officer to the deteriorated state of the health of the men. 8 . I am arranging with the Political authorities that the detachment shall move “ en bloc ” to the neighbouring hill station of Kacha, during the hot season, and am endeavouring to get hut accommodation put up there, and a connection with Robat by telegraph or telephone installed. 9. I am also arranging for portable stills as sanctioned in Army Depart ment letter No. 2650-C., dated 12th September 1907, and when these are obtained, and the arrangements named in the preceding paragraph carried out, I hope that by a regular relief of the detachment as proposed the garrisoning of this outpost may be carried on without it being the drain on the efficiency of the troops of the Quetta garrison, that it is at present. 10. The best time for the half-yearly relief to be carried out would be during March and April and October and November. Extract paragraph 1 of a letter from the General Officer Commanding, Quetta Division^ No. 1114-B,, da,ted 31st December 1907. (On case I. B. No. 2 — 1908, Guards and Escorts). In continuation of my No. 784-B., dated 16th November 1907, regarding the proposed half-yearly relief of the Robat detachment, I have the honour to inform you that the opening sentence of paragraph 7 should have read an “ extra recurring annual charge of Rs. 9,400 ” instead of “ a recurring charge, etc.”t 5 S i .k 5 N« * ; No. 174-C. (Confidential), dated Seistan, the 22nd May 1908, Prom Major R. !L. Kennion, I.A., His Britannic Majesty^s Consul, Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to address you on the subject of a scheme of defence for this Consulate. 2. Although at the present time it is difficult to imagine circumstances arising, involving the Consulate in a defence against an organised attack, yet the hold of the Central Government over the country is very insecure and the whole future of the country doubtful: so much so, that it seems to me we should be|prepared for eventualities that are not at first sight at all likely. If, for instance, Russia were constrained to send troops into Persia, a contingency which cannot be considered very remote, it is conceivable that a wave of Anti- European fanaticism might pass over the country in which Seistan and the Kainat would be affected. In these circumstances, it is possible that Europeans in Seistan might have to defend themselves against Persian sarhazes, who at a time like that postulated would be under no control, as well as against a local mob. In view of the possibility of such a contingency, remote though it may he, I think the precaution of making the defence of the Consulate possible should not be omitted. 3. I submit herewith a copy of a scheme worked out by Lieutenant Molesworth, R. E., with the assistance and advice of Captain Gibbon (Intel ligence Branch) when these two officers were recently in Seistan, It will be seen that its chief feature is the erection of bastions at certain points in the outer wall. These bastions could not of course be built without attracting a good deal of attention ; but, as pointed out by Lieutenant Molesworth, it could be explained that they were for ornamental purposes. In any case perhaps the right of the Persian Government to make objections to the style of any building erected within the Consulate enclosure would not he admitted. I do not anticipate that the erection of these bastions would at the present time arouse locally any serious popular feeling against the Consulate. As regards cost, the following is an abstract of the estimates * which have * Telephone estimates b, Mr. McManu., s.b- been prepared by Lieutenant Daukes and Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs. of which Copies are enclosed I— Krans, (1) - 5 masonry bastions @ krans 760 ••• ••• (2) .

A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires at Tehran. SCHEME OF DEFENCE FOR THE SEISTAN CONSULATE. 1. General Description. —The Consulate consists of an irregular poly gonal figure, about 400 yards long by 300 yards wide. It is everywhere enclosed by a kutcha brick wall about 8' high by 2' thick. In addition to the Consulate itself, this enclosure contains the escort lines, hospital, office and various subsidiary buildings. 2. Nature of Attack.—The nature of the attack is very difficult to state. It is most probable that it will be in the nature of a sudden rush, which if repulsed may lead to nothing; and it is fairly certain that it will be intermittent; also that anything w hich may be called a success by the attacking force is likely to attract greater numbers. The assailants will probably be armed with country made rifles with possibly a few Martini or similar weapons ; but it is extremely unlikely that they will possess any artillery. How much notice of an attack there is likely to be is again a matter of uncertainty. To put the matter in its worst aspect we have:— Little or no warning of an attack. Likelihood of a good percentage of Martini rifles among the attackers. Siege continued, though intermittently, for a week. 3. Time when relief may he expected. —The double company of Indian infantry stationed at Robat in Baluchistan, aided possibly by some Baluchist »n Levies, will, it is understood, be able to march to Nasratabad in five days; but may be delayed by water on the road, and it may be impossible to communicate with them when the first attack is made. Their approach is not likely to be seriously contested, and on their arriving within a day’s march the siege of the Consulate would probably be raised. 4. Garrison.

Armament.-* The amount of arms and ammunition in the Consulate is as * Sixteen Chagai Levies are also armed with ear- follows 30 Lee-Enfield rifles with 39,700 bines. ° rounds and 30 Martini*Henry rifles with 8,500 rounds approximately. 6 General Scheme. —Everything seems to indicate a double line of defence the outer line coinciding with the outer wall and the inner line with the main building itself. The outer wall is necessary since its vigorous defence :— May entirely dispose of a half hearted attack. (ii) will give time for the removal of non-combatants and stores from the hospital and sowars’ lines. The inner line will be the headquarters during the siege and the non-combatants will be taken there and if the outer wall falls will be held as a keep. It is necessary to keep all defences as inconspicuous as possible so as to avoid exciting comment. [iii) it will not be necessary to demolish anything on mere rumour when expecting an attack 7. Outer Jirae.—The disadvantages of the outer line are {%) enormous length compared with number of defenders. (ii) Restricted field of fire in certain directions. (in) The wall itself can easily be battered down. What is chiefly required is a number of bastions arranged to look down the length of wall on the outside so as to prevent the enemy gathering there. The main gate is admirably suited for this purpose, as from the roof the whole ot t e south-west wall is under fire. The gate however should be reconstructed, being made stronger with a covering of sheet iron to prevent its being set on fire an set further out so as not to leave a recess in which men can congregate. At present the wall does not run straight between the various salients, so that it would need a great many bastions indeed to defend it a . 1 . therefore that as funds permit, and when the wall has to be renewe , rebuilt with perfectly straight lines. Bastions will then be necessary at the points marked they should take is that of an octagonal solid tower, about 1° in diameter, built into the wall and projecting some 4 on the far si orna- with battlements to serve as loop holes. They will be built os e 7 ments to the wall and will be strengthened with sandbags when required. .f i l f Sottf9merrt s serv/vc/ as /oopho/es ■Present wall ^eseni »altThere will he a circular staircase inside and an iron door at the bottom. If the outer line is breached the garrison will not retire but will bring a fire to bear on the enemy’s rear. The garrison should consist of not less than 3 sowars, and as many Afghans as can be given, up to 4. They should be provided with water, food and ammunition for at least 24 hours. This paragraph also holds good as regards the main gate. The two small latrines projecting from the south-west corner should be removed and rebuilt elsewhere. 8 . Inner Zme.-—The Consulate building is extremely strongly built, the walls being three or four feet thick. Its chief disadvantage is its restricted field of fire to the south-west (the direction of the Escort lines). The garrison should not contain less than 7 sowars in addition to all the remaining rifles available. Most of the garrison will be stationed on the roof. Eor this purpose it is advisable that the parapet wall be continued right round the roof. A number of walls in the Consulate enclosure which cannot be enfiladed from the roof should be demolished. The block of cook-rooms (No. 2 in map) which is extremely close up to the main building should, if feasible, be removed at least as far as the block of stables (No. 3) when they next have to be rebuilt. There will be no difficulty about water, as by digging a few feet down through the floor it will he obtained. 9. General Remarks. —There is a line of willows along the whole of the inside of the north wall. If barbed wire were threaded through this it would make a very efficient obstacle indeed. And if practicable willows should be grown around the other side and barbed wire, say a mile in all, be ordered from India. Of course the wire need not be attached until the outbreak of hostilities. A number of sandbags, say 3,000, should be ordered. Eor blocking up the doors and windows of the Consulate large sacks which can be obtained locally will be better, as they cannot be so easily pushed aside. I am very strongly in favour of hand grenades being improvised; their use would be attended with immense moral effect. It would of course be difficult to make them up, but possibly some of the sowars may have been through an explosive class and can use guncotton. About 2 pounds of guncot ton in a tin, the rest of which is filled with stones, would about be the thing, or locally made powder may be substituted for guncotton. I suggest the following being indented for:— 100 pounds guncotton. 60 primers (2 oz.) 60 detonators. 100 Bickford fuse. (guncotton may be stored and used wet, but primers should be kept dry— varnished if necessary ; and detonators should not he stored in the same place as other explosives). Explosives are also required for demolition of buildings in enclosure after outbreak of hostilities. lam informed that it is likely that a new hospital* will be built to the •This paragraph was written prior to receipt of SOUth-WCSt Of the present enclosure.

Dated (&gt;th December 1207. Rough estimate oj cost of constructing certain buildings mentioned in Lieu* tenant Molesworth's defence scheme. Cost of building bastions (vide paragraph 10 (1) of Lieutenant Moles- worth’s Defence Scheme). Lieutenant Molesworth has proposed that five bastions should be built— each bastion to be ‘‘ an octagonal solid tower, about 10' in internal diameter, built into the wall and projecting some 4' on the far side of it, with battle ments to serve as loop-holes.’ , Ostensibly these bastions would be built as ornaments to the wall as in the case of the existing front gate. 2 . In order to enable men to fire from the roofs, these must be built level and not in the form of “ gumbazes ” as in the case of other buildings in the Consulate. This can be effected in two ways:— (1) By building a “ gumbaz ” or dome and then bringing up the level by depositing kankar, earth, etc. (as has been done in the front gate) ; or (2) By building the roofs of tamarisk as was, I believe, done in the case of some of the Mission buildings—for this purpose tamarisk would have to be imported from Minakungi. (i) would probably give better results and could be more easily arranged locally. 3. Rough estimate for a bastion.* Krans.

As, owing to proximity of the water to the surface of the ground in Seistan, there will be no foundations, it would appear advisable to gradually dimmish the breadth of the walls. § These will be made as narrow slits which will give a sufficiency of light, look fairly ornamental, and at the same time afford little mark to any but a good rifleman.

Add to this cash payments (krans 60) and total cost is krans 522 per bastion. It should, however, be noted that last year’s rates for pucca brickwork are probably below the mark since they were based entirely on foundations laid for the escort lines ; these were laid on the surface of the ground and to an incon siderable bight and the labour therein employed cannot be considered a true test for a building consisting entirely of pucca brick. It will probably be found that the rates for pucca brickwork on a large scale will not fall far short of krans 50 per 100 cubic feet, that is, unless cost of brick and lime can be substantially reduced. At this rate each bastion would cost krans 760, and the live bastions would entail an expenditure of krans 3,800. (Sd.) C. T. DAUKES, Lieutenant, LA , His Britannic Majesty's Tice-Consul, Seistan. Estimate for demolition and reconstruction of block of servants 1 quarters and other buildings. Krans 3,800 or, at present rate, Es, 1,118. 1 n Preliminary Bemarks. The demolition of the block of servants’ quarters on the north-east side of the present Consulate building is contemplated for reasons (1) of improving the defensive position of the Consulate, (2) replacing the present quarters, which are in a bad condition, by others more sanitary and better arranged. 2. The present block consists of (a) eight single quarters averaging nine feet in length and breadth, with walls of a thickness of 2|' and two courtyards, toge ther with three quarters and a courtyard which have been combined into a single married quarter, and (b) a detached line of three godowns and two addi tional servants’ quarters with a pigeon and cow house built to the east of them. They are made of sun-burnt brick throughout, though, in some places, the lower portions of the walls have been lined with pucca brick in order to lessen the erosion caused by shora. 6 jam.When reconstructing, I would suggest that two married quarters should be built after the style of those made for the escort family lines last year. The dimensions might he slightly smaller (though, even so, larger than at present): I would propose 12' by 10' with a courtyard 20' by 12'. Two such quarters would cost approximately krans 800, the cost of each quarter for the escort lines (which were somewhat larger) having amounted to krans 487. No sunk foundations would he made hut the first two and a half feet would he of baked brick in order to avoid erosin by shora. The remaining quarters would be single and unprovided with courtyrads, though a general open courtyard might be constructed as shown in the plan. The total number of rooms necessary (including those for servants now in the separate block and godowns near pigeon house) would be thirteen. I have not, however, included all of these in the detailed estimate which relates only to the first block paragraph 2 («)). If approved their cost can he readily worked out on the basis of those already done. 3 . The arrangement shown in the plan seemed to be the most convenient inasmuch as (i) quarters III, Y and IV, VI can he easily converted into married quarters should this be at any time necessary, (ii) the godowns are practically detached as they face away from the quarters, (iii) the pigeon house and cow house are separate, (iv) the entire block is compact. 4. Each quarter will be provided with— (а) JBadgir or ventilation shaft. (б) Eire place. (c) Window in dome, if necessary. These are not being estimated for in detail, as their cost is small, but a small sum will be added to the detailed estimate. //ote-Married quarters face south »ith their bach or the *ope&lt;n courtyard. v t '5 1 Courtyard Courtyard I n &lt;&gt; &lt;y- , “iV - / 2 '- * 3- ^ ^ ' ^ -j'-* A?

Height 8 ' and average thickness 2|'. On the south and west sides the wall is comparatively straight, but on the north and east is full of curves and angles and would therefore be difficult to defend unless a large number of bastions were constructed and the defenders could spare men to hold them. Lieutenant Molesworth, R.E., recommended that these walls (which are also in a bad state of repair) should be straightened. This will entail (a) taking in a little waste ground which lies outside the Con sulate, and ( 6 ) rebuilding the greater portion of the wall on the north and east sides. (a) could probably be arranged locally. As ragards (h) a rough estimate of the probable cost of demolition and reconstruction is given below :— Description .—A wall of about 8 ' high built of sun-dried brick, plastered with ka-gil (bhoosa and clay) of a thickness of 2 J\ The first few layers, to the height of 8 ' to be of baked brick (pucca) and of a thickness of 3'.

The outer walls on the south and west faces of the present Consulate building have been carried to a height a little above the level of the roof and the upper part of the low wall thus made has been crenelated. This serves two purposes :— (1) It gives the building a more finished appearance, and (2) affords shelter to persons who may be called upon to defend the building from the roof. It has now been proposed to extend these battlements to the north and east faces and an approximate estimate of the probable cost, based on the present rates of burnt brick constsuction in Seistan (as worked out in building the foundations of the hscort lines) is given herewith :— It has been found necessary to reduce the thickness of the brickwork in places owing to the space being encroached upon by the domed roofs which cover the central portion of the present building.

Xote.—E very 4' of the lower wall will be furnished with a battlement length 2' 6' and therefore 1' 6' in every 4' must be excluded from length of upper portion. 11If Approximately 1,400 cubic feet of burnt brickwork is thus required. The rate, however, will probably be somewhat higher than that for laying foundations as bricks and material must be conveyed to the roof and extra labour is thereby involved. At krans 50 per 100 cubic feet, the total cost will be krans 700 (seven hundred only). It is of course possible that the work may be carried out more cheaply, in which case the rates will be noted for future guidance, but I do not think the difference is likely to be considerable.

Cost of bars will therefore amount to krans 150. Cost of steel sheeting is approximately Bs. 7-8 per cwt. Transport of same to Seistan approximately Bs. 10. Therefore cost of one cwt.

Butler, Esq., C.I.E,,, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, In continuation of my letter No. 516-Confidential, dated the 18th May 1908,1 have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter No. 222-Confidential, dated the 29th May 1908, from the Political Agent, Chagai, explaining the circumstances of the escape of the arms caravan under Jodha Kubdani into Afghanistan. I agree with the Political Agent in thinking that the number of men that were available to operate against this caravan were insufficient to allow of the effective patrolling of the stretch of desert country through which Jodha and his caravan passed, and that no blame attaches to Thanedar Sharbat Khan for their escape. No,—222-Confidential, dated the 29th May 1908, From—The Political Agent, Chagai,. To—The Frst Assistant to the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. In accordance with the orders conveyed in your office letter No. 464, Confidential, dated the 5th instant in regard to the escape of Jodha Kubdani which was reported in paragraph 4 of my diary for the week ending 16th April last, I have the honour to say that the investigations ordered have been carried out wdth the following result. 2. Jodha Kubdani started from Garmsel some months ago with the inten tion of purchasing rifles. My enquiries tend to show tliat the funds with which he was supplied were derived largely from Nowshervvan, brother to the late Muhammad Umar whose rifle trading proclivities I previously had occasion to bring to the Hon ’ble the Agent to the Governor-Genaral’s notice in suggest ing the expediency of his removal from the Chagai Frontier. Having made his purchases in either Jalk or in the country to the south, Jodlia set out, with a caravan of either four or five camels, on his return journey towards the end of March. From Jalk it would appear he marched north-east until ne struck the Talab river which he followed up as far either as Nado or Talab Chah, a point which is not clear but the general consensus of evidence appears to favour the latter place. From this point water was carried and the trade route was crossed somewhere in the vicinity of Borghar whence the caravan headed for Drana Koh and thereafter, it is understood, for Zirreh. The Thanedar Saindak, K. S. Sharbat Khan, was duly advised that this caravan was appro aching and was instructed to make the necessary dispositions and this was accordingly done but without establishing touch with Jodha. The weather26 was hot'and it was not supposed that this man would risk the crossing Tf the desert from a point so far south, but would move up to Up or ' Juzhak. The ground which intervenes between Borghar and Talab Chah is broken by a series of low ranges and is not the onen plain which one would suppose from the map. What apparently happened w P as this. Jodha marched by night, and lay up by day and avoidmg the vicinity of danger, out the trade route as I have said near Borghar. While I had been hopeful of intercepting this man and Ins arms, yet I would ven lire to refer to the difficulties which attended the latter operation. Ihe Kubdams have personal acquaintance with every inch of the country and whether they traverse it by day or night is a matter of indifference. The country which inter venes between the Talab river and the trade route is a desert much cut up, and devoid of water. The difficulties of establishing an effective patrol along the desert stretch between Humai and Amalaf are great and to have been effective a much larger number of men than are available were necessary To guard this stretch, which is 89 miles broad, at night is a still more difficult matter. I have informed K. S. Sharbat Khan that I regret he was unable to make better arrangements for intercepting this caravan, but I think that this is the severest censure that the circumstances of the case demand for excluding dak sowars, he had only two men available at Sindak and 8 aiKilla Suffaid, 19 miles away As illustrating the difficulty attendant on night.operations in this country, I would say that I am in receipt cf a letter from the Officer Commanding at Sam- d&amp;k from which it would appear that a detachment of h.s men under two British officers recently came up with an arms caravan at nightfall, but although fire was exchanged, the caravan succeeded in effecting its escape n-n r/h o -1M7 P fl No. 417-P., dated Karachi, the 8th (received llth) June 1908 (Confidential).

My Loud, Reverting to my telegram, Foreign Secret, dated the 16th of your Government, a copy of a Despatch, No. 152, dated 17th June last, from Mr. Marling. It seems desirable to arrive at some understanding with the Amir before the next caravan season, since the probability of attacks upon the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and upon other British persons and interests in Persia, cannot be ignored. I do not suggest that any handle should be given to the Amir for controversial correspondence, but it might be pointed out to him that, if arms are required for “ arming the people of Afghanistan with his permission, some other means might be devised for obtaining them which would not involve the traffic through Persia with the tribes on our side of the line, or the risk of violent conflicts in Persia between his own and British subjects. The matter is one in which a friendly exchange of views may lead to a clear understanding as to the extent to which His Majesty the Amir really approves of the traffic with his own people, and to means being devised for satisfying his wants by legitimate means.

With reference to my Despatch No. 134, of 22nd May 1908, I have now the honour to report that a caravan convening aims, said to consist of 900 camels, and escorted by armed Afghans whose numbers are variously estimated at from 100 to 1,200 men, has made its \\a\ almost unmolested to some point on the Perso-Afghan frontier north of Koh-i-Malik Siah. p t i r . From the telegraphic reports of the officers of the Indo European Telegraph Department stationed at Bam and Dehanneh, which I have received from the Director of the Persian Section of that Department, it appears that this caravan travelled from Mmab wa Rudbar, Masitabad, Chah-i-Malik, Dashta, Gurg, Gerageh, Baluchab, and Nawar Chain The Persian local authorities in the districts traversed by the caravan appear to have endeavoured to comply with the orders sent, at my instigation, by the Central Government to head the caravan off towards British territory, but, as I anticipated they were unable to effect this owing to lack of all organisation and to being far worse armed than the Afghans. In one case only did a Persian force venture to attack the ca?avan, and it was compelled to withdraw hurriedly from the ^Tfe Indo-European Telegraph line between Robat and Dehanneh was cut and much dakage was done to poles, f^ Afgl-- - Aey passed Dehanneh They probaWy wis ie V ^ ^ ^ movements being telegrapnea to oui , , ,i T t 0 , rnT A rw flrt _ according to the report of a Persian employe of the telegraph Depart accoping to i f by them but subsequently escaped anxious to meut, ‘ . f ci'v nf 'their comrades who were killed m the encounter avenge the death of six of heir comraaes w ^ with His ^ajestys Ships in^ and wa P s CzedAy the was sent from Dehanneti t0 » , j an Englishman at Afghans who enquired ^ ai ^ lcl J^ly ^ thev Wd find.

India Office, wnu r , o- ti 6th February 1907. \ ith reference to Sir E. Oorst’s letter of the 30th January 1906 iegai( nig the measures to be taken in connection with the outbreak of plague in Seistan, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to enclose, lor the information of the Secretary of State for Joreign Affairs, a copy of a letter from the Government of India legardmg the incidence of the cost of the double company of Native Infantry now stationed at Robat. The Government of India, it will be seen, takes the view, in which the Secretary of State for India in Council concurs, that, the object of the despatch of these troops to Robat being to secure the lives and property of British officers and subjects in Eastern Persia, the extra cost incurred should be divided between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers m the same manner as other charges connected with the Diplomatic and Consular establishments in Persia. The total extra charge up to the end of 1906 was Rs. 1,25,000 (8,333/, Os. Scl), and a monthly expenditure of Rs. 10,500 (700/.) will continue to be incurred, until the troops are withdrawn to India. I am to express the hope of the Secretary of State in Council that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will submit the claim of the Government of India for the favourable consideration of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, as he finds it impossible to justify the incidence of the whole charge upon the revenues of India.

I am commanded by the Army Council to acquaint you that they have been informed by the Treasury that it is proposed to charge to Army funds half the extra expenditure involved in the movement of a double Company of Indian Native Infantry to Robat on the Perso-Baluch frontier. The Council, to whose knowledge this matter is now brought for the first time, have agreed, with the sanction of the Treasury, to accept liability for half the out-of-pocket extra expenditure incurred in consequence of the troops being temporarily stationed at Robat, on the understanding that the amounts to be thus shared shall not include any charges for furlough of troops after returning to India, pension in respect of the period of service on the frontier, or other “constructive” items of cost. It is understood that about 10,000/. extra was so spent up to the end of the financial year 1906-07, and that extra expenditure is continuing at the rate of about 700/. a month. The latter figure would appear ‘prima facie to approximate rather to the whole normal cost of a double 9Oompany of Indian Native Infantry, but the Government of India will be able to state whether these figures are correct, and if so how they are arrived at. It is impoitaut foi iinancial reasons that the War Office share of the amounts spent to the end of 1906—07 should be repaid to Indian revenues and hi ought to account in this Department before 30th September next, and I am therefore to request that the Government of India may be urged by cable to render an account of as much of the expenditure as practicable at the earliest possible date.

We have the honour to address you on the subject of the incidence of the cost of the double company of Native Infantry now stationed at Rohat. 2. It will he remembered that in a telegram* from the Foreign Office, London, dated the 1th January 1906, His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran was instructed to “ concert with the Government of India and the Consul-General at Bushire the best means of ensuring that a force should be available, in the event of necessity arising, for despatch to Tehran or any other part of Persia with the least possible delay”, the object to “be confined to the rescue of British subjects and the protection of their lives in emergency”. In consequence of disturbances which had occurred at Meshed, and in antici pation of similar disturbances in Seistan, the double company was moved from Quetta to Robat in February 1906, with a reserve of arms and ammunition &gt; for the Consulates, under the authority tD’ 0 ’ 1 r + Enclosure No. 2 . conveyed in your telegram,f dated the 30th January 1906, and has since been retained there owing to events in Seistan, which have necessitated special precautionary measures for the protec tion of the lives and property of British subjects. 3. The object of the move being thus political in character, we have decided} that all extra charges on account j Enclosure No. 3. o £ move of the troops to Robat and their maintenance there shall be classified as civil, and we presume that, on the analogy of the charges on account of the consular guards in Persia, the extra expenditure will be borne in equal proportions by the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. We propose, therefore, with your concurrence, to adjust the charges accordingly.2 4 So far as it can at present be computed, the initial and terminal expenditure involved will together amount to Us. 30,000 and there will be a reenrrin- monthly expenditure of Ks. 10,500, until such tune as the detach- ment is recalled to Quetta.
