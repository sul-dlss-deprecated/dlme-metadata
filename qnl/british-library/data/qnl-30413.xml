The Senior Naval Officer asVed me to send him a provisional programme for the visit and I enclose a copy of this for your information* The date by which this programme was required made it impossible for me to refer to you regard ing taose items vshich concern you* I have suggested, as you will see, that the Comrranaer- m-Chlef pays a visit to halt al Falaj meets you and your Indian Officers and sees the men informally on parade.Later on after a drive in the country with me he returns and has tea vith you* These arrangements were made for the Commander-in-chief f s visit to Muscat on the last ti-ne a British Commandant of the Corps was present and so I have included them for this year and trust you will agree, as I have already mentioned the programme is merely provisional and can be altered if there is, in the items ‘which concern you, anything you find inconvenient.

Political Agency and n,B # M f s ConiiUlate,Muscat* Camp Office, Zaiart, 6th October 1906. To The Postmaster, Karachi. Memorandum. Reference my memorandum No.Z/13 of k3rd September 1956 would you please inform me whether the letter enclosed therein was delivered to the Secretary to His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in H.M.S, ’’Norfolk' on October rnd, a special postal bag addressed to the Treasury Officer, Political Agency, Muscat, was despatched by me through the local Post Office here on September ;c5th. A receipt for this is in my possession. The Ziarat Postmaster assures me that the bag was duly despatched to Quetta by the Mail Van which left that day and that he is positive that no delay would occur in it being forwarded on to Karachi the same day by the Karachi Mail train. The bag presumably therefore arrived in Karachi on the evening of September k6th. The Up Glow Gulf Mail steamer, as you are aware, leaves Karachi on Sundays at 9 A.M. at earliest so there could be apparently no reason for the bag not to nave been despatched by the steamer which sailed on September &amp;7th. I am, however, informed by Muscat Agency of!ice that no special bag from me^received by this Up slow mail which arrived there on September Jc9th, 5. As the bag in question contains a number of important Government despatches I should be grateful if you would have urgent enquiries made concerning its whereabouts and inform me of the result by telegram.
