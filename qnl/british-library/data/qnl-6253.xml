The intention is that the represen tative of the Ministry of War Transport will be instructed to ship only cargo which is included in the monthly programmes and which may be classed as an essential import. Only the latter class of imports shoaid be included in the monthly reports. In tnis connection, your attention is invited to paragraph 2 of my memorandum No.C/698-1.a/48 of 1st July 1941, regarding /&gt; ,77 jj rJa* * priority items. 2. I should therefore be most grateful if you would advise importers accordingly and I also request that the Director of Customs may scrutinise requirements very carefully before finally submitting his monthly programmes. 3. It has also been brought to my notice that swing to fluctuating prices, importers are reluctant to commit themselves in advance to definite or even preferred sources. I need hardly point out that the present regulations have been adopted not only to assist the war effort but also to help the merchants themselves and I would be grateful if you would warn them that the matter is too serious for indecision and that they must commit themselves now and adhere to their commitments.

Memorandum Reference your Express Letter No.C/505 dated the 22nd April 1942. 2. I beg to attach a statement showing (a) the commodities required for consumption within the Trucial Coast. As regards (b) which is for re-export to Sa'udi Arabia. Of these six commodities very small and negligable quantity is being exported to Sa*udi Arabia each month which does not, so far,exceed one ton. Therefore I have omitted showing the export of these commodities to Sa f udi Arabia. 3. The figures given to me by the local authorities as being required for consumption within their respective Shaikhdoms are not all correct but include the quantity which they usually re-export to Iran and other places other than the Trucial Coast. Therefore I have added another coitnmn showing the quantity which I consider is reasonable for consumption the in each Sheikhdom. This is based on/number of inhabitants and the figures of exports from India and Dubai to each Sheikhdom on the Trucial Coast. The figures in black show the figures given to me by each shaikh while those in red show the amount I consider reasonable for each sheikdom. 4. ABU DHABI* I sent a letter to the Shaikh asking him to send me the details required. He was not present and as I dj 3 not get a reply in time I sent a car with another lettersaskin him to send me the reply with the messenger. The Shaikh was out in the desert looking for fresh water. He sent his brother to Abu Dhabi to collect the information and kept my messenger with ftim in the desert. Today I received his reply which is vague and does not answer my enquiry. He said M The totalquantity of foodstuffs required monthly from India is one thousand tons M • To ask the Shaikh again would mean another delay and the reply may not also be correct or satisfactory. Therefore I made enquiries from the Hindu and Persian merchants who export these commodities to Abu Dhabi both from India and the Trucial Coast and wrote them in the statement as being a reasonable estimate for Abu Dhabi*s consumption. These figures do not include re-eports to other than Abu Dhabi»s District. 5* DUBAI, under Dubai, I have given the figuress- (i) the actual consumption in Dubai District,(ii&gt; the quantity required for re-export to Qatar and (iii) the quantity which is required for re-export by sea to the rest of the Trucial Coast. The total of these three items is the quantity required for consumption in Dubai and re-export to Qatar and the rest of the given Trucial Coast and does not include the quantity fiYiK* in the statement for each Shaikdom separately. 6, If it is considered necessary to fix an allotment for each shaikdom separately on the basis of the figures given in the statement, I submit that it would be necessary for us to inform each Shaikh of the allotment allowed to him fco that he may be careful about re-exports. Residency Agent,Sharjah. u Ifir X vs Confidential. No.C/530 . Political Agency, Bahrain, the 27th April 1942. To M ^ A \ The Residency Agent, Sharjah. Memorandum. I understand from the Political Agent that this Agency letter No.C/495 dated the 18th April 1942 has not made the Government of India's instructions clear to you. I shall now endeavour to clarify them. 2. In the past you were required to send to this office two programmes. The first,called the Civil Requirements Programme, gave the total amounts in tons of goods for which shipping space was required in respect of each of 12 named loading areas. Differentiation was made between definite sources and preferred sources. 3. The second programme contained details of ports of loading, commodities, consignors, consignees and weights of commodities in tons. This is usually referred to in this office as the Loading Programme although I notice that you do not use this name to distinguish it from the Civil Require ments Programme. 4. The new instructions contained in the Agency letter under reference require you to submit 3 different kinds of programme. Two of them are Requirements Programmes i.e. quarterly programmes and monthly programmes. The third is the Loading Programme which you have been sending in the past. 5. The first of these Programmes deals with commodities for which shipping space is to be found and is to be submitted quarterly in advance. The second is similar but is to be submitted monthly giving more accurate and up to date informa tion than is contained in the first. Both of these program mesare to show separately in respect of each loading area the amount of each bulk commodity (e.g. wheat or flour, rice, sugar, coffee or pepper) for which substantial shipping space is required for the Trucial Coast. Previously only the total of all commodities was shown. Figures for commodities not in bulk (i.e. commodities in packing cases such as tea, drugs, canned fruits, cigarettes, glassware, haberdashery, matches and piecegoods as opposed to bulk commodities shipped in sacks or loose), and figures for small quantities of bulk commodities should be lumped together under the head 'General Cargo'. 6. It will not be necessary in future Requirements Programmes to differentiate between definite and preferred sources. 7. I enclose two specimen forms one for the monthly Requirements Programme which, as before, can be worked out from the Loading Programme or as much of it as is known at the time, the remainder being estimated; and one for the quarterly programme which will have to be entirely estimated in advance. 8. The third programme, i.e. the Loading Programme containing details of port of loading, consignor, consignee etc. should be sent with, or as soon as possible after, the new monthly Requirements Programmes. I enclose a form for this also. 9. The Government of India will take a third of the total requirements of each commodity estimated in the pro gramme for the quarter July-August-September as the require ments for July. If the requirements of any particular commodity or the total requirements of all commodities for July are such that a third of the quarterly programme would be an inaccurate estimate for that month you should report this before May 12th. 10. Subsequently if you find in the beginning of June that your calculations for August in the quarterly programmeprogramme have proved inaccurate, either in any particular commodity or in the total of commodities for the month, you should send an amendment by June 12th, and again by July 12th in respect of any difference between your estimate for September in the quarterly programme and your actual requirements* When you send these amendments you should normally use the forms provided for monthly Civil Requirements Programmes or as much of them as are applicable. If there are no amendments you should telegraph 'No amendment' on the dates mentioned and the monthly programme need not be sent* 11* This involves your making out your monthly programmes nearly 7 weeks ahead of the time to which they refer* The difficulty of this is appreciated but you should collect as much information as possible from consignees and endeavour to estimate the remaining requirements as accurately as possible. The monthly loading programmes should of course follow, whether you have sent a monthly requirements programme or only a 'No amendment' telegram, as soon as you are able to get details of consignments from the consignees. 12* Air Mail rather than telegraph should be used whenever feasible.

If i it is impossible to let Persia have any more of these two commodities I would urge that provision should at least be made for the supply of other commodities such as rice f barley, tea and coffee, and also possibly piecegoods of which there is a terrible shortage, from the Arab States either on the basis of previous exports of these articles to Persia or in exchange for goods imported such as those described in paragraph 3 above.

The Shaikh of Dubai prohibited the export of rice to all parts except Qatar and Trucial Coast with effect from 1st April 194?. During your recent visit to the Trucial Coast I mentioned to you the large quantity whichwds being grp-irtiorl exported to Persia. Before your departure you instructed me to draw the Shaikh^ attention about the export of sugar from Dubai which I did. The Shaikh then consulted the Persian merchants who soid that they had large quantities in stock and that large consignments were on their way to Dubai in sailing crafts © They complains,* that if sugar was prohibited from being exported to Persia many merchants who imported this commodity for the sole purpose of exporting it to Persia would become bankrupt. To restrict the exports of sugar and tea the Shaikh imposed an export duty of Rs.10/- on a bag of sugar and Rs.5/- on a chest : of tea. is the prices in Persia were good this did not effect shipments except for few hours and they continued exports as xsuc'i. when I received your letter I wrote oo fII the -Shaikhs. Sharjah, Dubainaand Ajman prohibited exports by issuing an Ilan (notice) and the rest of the .Shaikhs by issue of instructions to all their officials to prevent re-exports to Bther parts, in Dubai the merchants said to the shaikh that in Bahrain and other Places re-exports were allowed and in support of their statement 3.3id that- 2 - ,-v. said that some goods actually arrived from Bahrain to Dubai and that Bahrain was also exporting goods to other places and in particular Persia. They also said that Muscat also allowed exports but on a small scale. The Shaikh, asked me if il knew if this was correct but as I had no details I said that I could not tell him in details of what restrictions were imposed at otner places but that I was sure no foodstuffs etc. were allowed for re-exports. As the Shaikh was sending to rue and asking about uhe details every not and then and the merchants were bringing pressure to bear upon him, I said that if he gave me a list of the c&amp;ief commodities which they want to export with details as to the quantity now in stock with each merchant I will refer the matter to you and ask for instructions but that in the mean time he should observe strict prohibition on all goods. He asked all the leading merchants in Dubai to give^a list of tire follow ing commodities which i^usually re-exported to Persia and Iraq This list does not include the quantity of goods in stock v'ith petty merchants or shop-keepers nor does it, according to the Shaikh, include the type of piece goods in stock which is for the local people 4 - piece-goods *145,150 pieces(Taqal 643 Chests Sugar 19,571 bags Coflee 3,128 ' Black pepper........ 2,161 »» lunneric....................... 587 ** Cardamoms63 Chests Besides the above quantity of sugar now in stock about 8000 bags are,according to the merchants, on their way to Dubai for re export to Persia.

As tiie quantity imported wus less th than the actual requirements, the merchants used to make up the deficiency from tlie quantity they had in U: rlr stores anemthis manner the (quantity they had in their stores began to decrease and the demand for more imports increased. Rice ^s also imported in large quantity into tlie rest of the Trueial Sliaikhdoms besides Sharjah and Dubai. For this reason I accepted tlie fi^pures as correct estimate of actual needs of the fcnole population of tlie Iruo.Lail Coast taking into consideration lie number of tlie population and not the amount of rice that was Imported and for which we had no correct fijures for the whole Trucial Coast. The merchants have been complaining since last veer that they were not getting -• 11 the goods they have been ordering owing to shipp ing ^i^fficuFfcies and that on certain occasions ohey were compell ed ytre goods in India to avoid extra oh rges while the goods were awaiting shipment indefinitely. 3. The Trucial Coast supplies the inhabitants(including bedouins) of the area from Khor Aalba to Khor al Udaid near* Qatar on the Coast and from Ibrl to Dhank in the li:chrah to Buraimi Casis the population of which is estimated to he not less olian 250,000 souls# As it is well known tlie .Arabs of ohe Ti*ucial Coast depend chiefly on rice and dates# They take two meals during the day and each person require* at least one pound of rice for the two meals or half a pound for one meal. Thus if we estimate thB population of this area to be 224,000 souls we find that we require 100 tons daily or 3000 tons monthly. 4. It is not clear to me from, the Government of India’s telegram Wo.3698 dated 11th Islay 1942 how 303C tons would provide for about 800,000 souls.
