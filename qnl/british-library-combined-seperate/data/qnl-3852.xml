The vast majority of the papers are covering letters that were originally sent with registration certificates by the Director of Customs to the Political Agency for counter-signing. The certificates were then returned by the Agency. The certificates were required by all craft intending to leave Bahrain waters. The practice ceased in January 1933.The file also contains some correspondence about the usefulness of the procedure, mostly between the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave), the Political Agency in Bahrain, the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, and the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department).Towards the back of the file is later correspondence relating to an incident involving the confiscation of registration certificates by Iranian port officials and a request to register a new tug boat from the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO).Folio 189 is internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Vessels</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000389#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000389#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
