The Land Department Regulation contained in the Bahrain Government Proclamation No. 1/1349 has not so far been applied to foreigners and if you now wish to have it applied to all persons subject to the Bahrain Order-in-Council, I should be grateful if you would send me a formal request for this to be done. I will then recommend that the necessary King’s Regulation be issued. 3. As the Proclamation No.l of 1349 was issued many years ago it seems likely that there have since been further amendments and modifications to it, and I should be grateful if you would let me have a completely revised and up to date version, if, and when, you send me the letter suggested in paragraph 2 above. C..1 3L.' o- ^^ i r* 13 l«l s Bahrain, August 15, 1946. n His Highness Shaikh Sulman has asked me to take up with you the matter of prevention of the use of narcotics in Bahrain. 2. in the past it was well known that many of the Persians and Baluchis living in Bahrain smoked opium, they practised the habit in moderation and in my opinion little real harm was caused. When opium was found being smuggled into Bahrain, usually by Persians, the culprits were prosecuted and punished and at times as the result of information obtained by the police raids were made on the houses of people who were selling opium which resulted in prosecutions but as long as the practice was almost entirely con fined to foreigners the Bahrain Government did not adopt very active measures to prevent it. 3. Unfortunately the opium habit increased and some of the Arabs adopted it. Cases in which Bahrain subjects were involved came into the Bahrain Courts and the courts dealt with them in the same way as with Bahrain subjects who were convicted of using or trading in liquor that is by a punishment of 6 months jM* 'Tl I rigourous imprisonment for selling or manufacturing liquor. 4. Now a new habit has developed and it is my considered opinion that if it cannot be effectively stopped it may cause serious and lasting harm to the people of Bahrain. During the last twelve months Hashish is being widely used by the Arabs in Manamah Confidential. ft 1BAHRAIN RECEIPT. i. / t S' '- ^ A U 12 - Manamah. and Muharraq* I believe this habit is at present confined to the towns and has not spread, yet, to the villages. I recently obtained some information from the widow of the late Khan Bahadur Abdurrahman Zayani who has four sons, two of them opium addicts, the third a drunkard, as the result of which the police made a round up of a number of places where Hashish was sold. Hashish worth many thousands of rupees was found and about half a dozen people, foreigners and Bahrain subjects were pro secuted for selling Hashish. His Highness Shaikh Sulman took a personal in terest in the matter and after discussing the matter with him it was decided that severe punishment should be given to the people concerned in this trade. All sellprs of Hashish and opium are now being given one year T s hard labour. It is hoped by these means to discourage the public from using Hashish. 5. Foreigners on the other hand who are punished by the Agency Court cannot be awarded more than three months hard labour or less with a fine. Trading in Hashish is very profitable. It is usually sold in made-up cigarettes at eight annas each and these cigarettes are being smoked more and more by young men. In very few of the cases which I have dealt with have the users been elderly people. I do not think it is necessary for me to enlarge on the danger to the population if the Hashish habit gets the people in its grip, the best known case of this is Egypt. The Bahrain Government proposes to do all that is pos sible to stop this habit partly by inflicting heavy penalties on people who are concerned in it and by endeavouring to prevent its entering Bahrain. i/&gt;}-3- 6. Would it be possible for the Agency Courts to deal more drastically with persons convicted of trading in Hashish in order to prevent the spread of a habit which may have lasting effects in Bahrain?

I fully agree with His Highness that the present punishment which the Agency Courts are empowered to give under the “Dangerous Drugs Regulation” (King’s Regulation No*l of 1931) i.e* f a maximum of 3 months R*I* and/or a fine of Es* 1500/- is most inadequate* When this question was first raised it was represented to the Government of India that the maximum punishment should be the same as in India* i*e** 2 years and/or fine with or without hard labour. The Government of India however* for reasons which are unknown but presu mably due to the fact that some further amendments would be necessary to Article 71 (&amp;) of the Bahrain Order-in-Council* did not agree. 3* I have issued instructions to the Courts concerned to impose the maximum punishment provided by law in all cases of Hashish and other “Dangerous Drugs'* and am going further into the question to see if it is possible to re-represent the whole case to the Government of India.

Dear Sir: For som tim th© Company baa folt the need for a set of rules and regulations governing the safe operation of sutenoMles of those of Its eaployees who are authorised to operate motor transport units of the Company's fleet. The Company has prepared a draft In booklet form of such rules and regulations they would like to adopt, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. The rules and practices as laid down therein are a composite effort to present safe driving regulations now in fore# in cities, states and countries all over the world* They are reopc^nised hy lead- ing international authorities as being fair, workable and safe for all automobile drivers everywhere. Zt is to be distinctly understood that ths rules contained in the proposed booklet are primarily intended to improve the operation of the Company's cam equipment by Its authorised employees within the *uher© of its Zone of Operations. Hotwithstanding that fact, it is m Company's intention that nothing contained therein shall conflict, or be construed as conflicting, in any way with any of the laws and ordinances currently enforced by The Bahrein Qovemmsnt covering the use of automobiles on Bahrein Island. Tour attention is respectfully directed to Pages 10 and 11 of the booklet which ©over the Item of 'HAM) AND ARM SIGNALS'. Please note that these proposed methods of visible signalling do not corres pond exactly to those illustrated in the pages of the motor vehicle Operator's License as issued by the Bahrein Government. As you are aware, the number of right hand drive automobiles on Bahrein Island is decidedly in the monorlty • especially so in our own case. It is noted that most of the privately purchased mew model American ears arriving in Hana;sa are of the loft hand drive type. It is this situation that prompts the proposed revision of hand and arm signals now in effect. The Company believes that the revised signals a c v s2 — 20, 1947 will cause m wtim haas»d during the tia» required to f^eUlnrlae all iriwere wi^i the mm* The signals are easily gtw«B and are went ob vious In their waning * they should m&amp;m* m eonfusion to anym. The Coopasy'* Safety Engineer, iar # T. B» firth, has inforwed this ©fflee that he has dlseussed this reeislon of eigmls with your Inspector Cochrane and that he Is net averse to their adoption. The CffiBp&amp;ny will, therefore, if you agree, appreelate your fhraal endorse- ent of ap^wval of the signals as shown, together with the reminder mf %hm mterial ooaprieiiig the entire booklet. It is the Conpany** intuition to lame this proposed booklet to our European personnel only, to start with.

In the Bahrain Gourts persons convicted of similar offences are sentenced to 12 months R.I.

Any person desirous of qualifying for a licence under this regulation may obtain a temporary permit from the licencing authority valid for three months. On or before the expiry of such permit, but not before the expiry of two months from the date of issue, the holder ma$F appear before the duly appointed authority to undergo the necessary driving test, and should such person pass the test satisfactorily a licence to drive may be issued to him. ( a ) Subject to the provisions of these regulations as to &lt;, the physical fitness of applicants for licences, the licencing authority, except in the case of an applicant who is disqualified as herein after mentioned, shall on the payment of the prescribed fee grant a licence to any person who applies for it in the prescribed manner and makes a declaration on the prescribed form that he is not under the provisions of these regulations disqualified by reason of age or otherwise fronTobtaining a licence. (b) The application of a professional driver or a driver of a motor vehicle let or plying for hire shall be accompanied by two bust photographs of the applicant which shall be of a size not smaller than x 2 ” and not greater than Sf” x 2%'. 3. Licences shall be of the form -prescribed by The Bahrain Government and where under these regulations the applicant is subject to any restrictions with iim respect to the driving of any class of motor vehicle, the extent of the restriction shall be specified on the licence. 4* (a) Subject to the provisions of these regulations with respect to temporary driving permits, the licence shall, unless previously revoked or surrendered, remain in force for a period of twelve months from the date on which it was granted. (b) The provisions applicable to the granting of a licence shall, so far as may be necessary, apply to the renewal thereof. 5. The fees for licences and permits granted under these regulations shall be published annually by The Bahrain Government. 6 • If a licence is not renewed within ten days from the date of its expiry, the holder shall, unless he can show good reason for his failure to renew within the time (e.g. absence from Bahrain, illness etc.) pay, on his licence being renewed by The Licencing Authority, a late fee of Rs.5 As. 8 . 7.

A person shall be disqualified for holding a licence:- •t-i, a whi l e another licence granted to him is in force whether ■cne licence is suspended or not. (b) if he is by a conviction under these regulations or by an or er of a Court thereunder disqualified for holding or obtaining -LXC 0 nC 6 * 9. In any proceedings the fact that a licence has been granted to a person shall be evidence that that person for the purpose of obtaining that licence made a declaration that he was not disqual ified for holding or obtaining the licence. 10. In this part of these regulations the expression ’’Licence” means a licence to drive a motor vehicle and the expression licencing authority” means the authority appointed by The Bahrain Government to issue such licences. an application for the grant of a licence the applicant shall make a declaration on the prescribed form as to whether or not he is suffering from any such disease or physical disability as maybe specified in the^form, or any other disease or physical disability which would be likely to cause the driving by him of a motor vehicle, being a vehicle of such class or description, as he would be authorised by the licence to drive, to be a source of danger to the public, and shall, In any case, be required to undergo an eye and medical examination if so required by the licencing authority. 12. If from the declaration it appears that the applicant is suffering from any such disease or disability as aforesaid the licencing authority will refuse to grant the licence provided that:- (a) a licence limited to driving an invalid carriage may be granted to the applicant if the licencing authority is satisfied that the applicant is fit to drive such a carriage. (b) an applicant who is refused a licence by the licencing authority on the grounds of disease or physical disability, may, in writing appeal to The Bahrain Government against the decision of the licencing authority showing such reason as he may have, as to why he should be granted a licence and if thought proper. The Bahrain Government may vary the original decision. 13. For the purpose of enabling the applicant for the grant of a licence to learn to drive a motor vehicle with a view to passing a test under these regulations, the licencMing authority may grant him a temporary permit to drive, on payment of the prescribed fee, such temporary permit to remain in force for three months from the oate of issue, such licence will be in the prescribed form and granted subject to the prescribed conditions* If any person to whom a temporary permit is granted fails to comply with any of its prkcribed conditions he shall be guilty of an offence. 14 14. If it appears to the licencing authority that there is reason to believe that any person who holds a licence granted by them is suffering from any disease or physical disability likely to cause the driving by him of a motor vehicle , being a vehicle of the class he Is authorised to drive, to be a source of danger to the public, and on enquiry into the matter the authority is satisfied that the holder of the licence is suffering from such disease or disability as aforesaid, then, whether or not the licence holder so suffering as aforesaid has previously passed a test, the licencing authority may, after giving the licence holder notice of a test, re-test the holder of the licence and should he fail to pass such test the authority shall revoke his licence and the licence holder shall deliver his licence up to the licencing authority for cancellation.SHEET THREE The licence holder may demand a further driving test if he is of the opinion that he can satisfy the licencing authority of his ability to drive, and if he so demands he shall be permitted a further test which however if he fails shall deprive him of all future right of a driving test. ^ 15.

It seems to me to be extremely long and somewhat complicated but the gist of it would meet the case in Bahrain. So far the only drugs which we have to deal with are opium and hashish neither cocaine, or morphine have yet made an appearance here, though it is possible that they may come. The punishments in the Act appear to be suitable also the main clauses which forbid possession, sale, import and export of dangerous drugs. 2. V/ould it be possible for you to authorise the Agency Court to take suitable action in drug cases pending the application of this Order. I understand that the I.A.P.A. can find no authority for passing sentence in such cases, although many have been heard before and sentences have been inflected. Major J.E.H.

I am afraid I have to revise my opinion again about the necessity for changing the law applied by the Agency re garding punishments. So far,in this year, only three cases concerning Hashish were heard in the Agency Court and it does not seem to me necessary to change the law in order to deal V- Cl with that number. 3. Although I thought I had given you sufficient information in my D.O.No.983, dated the 27th March, 1948, as to the power of the Agency Court regarding punishments, the second para graph of your letter quoted above indicates that you are still labouring under a misapprehension. As far as the Agency goes, dangerous drugs are regulated and punishments provided for offences concerning them in the 'Dangerous Drugs Regulations” being a King’s Regulation (No.l of 1931) made under Article 70 of the 'Bahrain Order-in-Council 1913'. I repeat that, as stated by Ranee In his D.O,No.2815-15/22, dated the 27th August, 1946, and by me in my D.O. referred to above, the etc. punishments for the import/of them,in the Agency Court,is a maximum of three months imprisonment and/or a fine of Rs.1500/-. Both the Indian Assistant to the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent are perfectly well aware of their power to punish in such cases. Yours sincerely, i C.D• Belgrave, Esquire, CBE, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN.d.o. ro.sssx- Adriserate August 31, 1948. Reference your D.O. No. 3470-3/11 dated 25tlx August 1948, I agree that it does not seem necessary to .change the law in order to deal with the present number of cases. 2. Regarding para 2 of my letter No. 1754- 1u of 27-8-48, the Police when prosecuting recently in a case about dangerous drugs were informed oy the Judicial Assistant that they must produce a Bahrain Ahlan on the subject before the court could deal with the case. It was for this reason that I asked whether the court of the Judicial Assistant could take action according to the proposed new order pending its coming into force. Evidently there was some misunderstanding in that particular case. H. B. M T Bahr-eirt. C.J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., H. B.

This might be amended although Article 92(2) would appear to allow a reference to the 1913 Order. I suggest that the phrase 'punishments prescribed for a breach of King r s xiegulations by the Order in Council for the time being in force' would be more suitable. This should be repealed so far as it applies. The Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1886, as the Act is now applied by the Order in Council. This also should be repealed so far as it applies 'The Indian Christian Marriage Act 1872' for the same reason as given for No.l of 1922. This should be repealed as the Act is applied by the Order in Council. This should be repealed so far as it applies 'The Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1923 u . The Act as now applied by the Order is restricted to part IV and excludes Sections 174 to 192 inclusive and sub-section (3) of Section 213. The King * s Regulation excludes only v sub-section (4) of Section 213. The whole King’s Regulation seems to need re-consider- ation. This should be repealed for the same reason as given for No.l of 1924. No. 1 of 1927This may need reconsideration in the light of the proposed revision of the Order. The reference to “local Government' is obscure. If it means a 'provincial Government' then powers may only be exercised by the Secretary of State. The powers have, as far as I can ascertain, never been exercised, I suggest that this King•s Regulation should be repealed. This shoula now be repealed - see No. 2 of 1922 above. [ suggest that the Political Agent Bahrain might be consulted. I submit a draft King f s Regulation for use should it be decided to repeal the King f s Regulation as I have suggested. Other drafts will be required if any of the King's itegulations are to be amended.DRAFT KING 1 S KEG ULATIOH Kotice The following Regulation, made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and allowed by His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, is published for general information.

In the aircrash case an inquest could have been held on bodies not recovered. I hope that the local police will continue to assist the Court as hitherto. Mr* Gethin's recollection as to Egyptian procedure is faulty. The procedure he refers to was adopted in the case of uniformed members of the British Forces only In all other cases a view of the body was essential. I will bear in mind the point regarding burial and think we should provide for powers of exhumation in the event of burial before the Court has indicated tnat it no longer requires the body. 3d/No.3163-5/11 Dear Gethin, PoliGical AotJacy, Bahrain, 21st Oct. 1950.

Meaoranduia ^ • I have been approached by the Bahrain Gevernnent in cennection with the punishnent tha\ inflicted can be £j0£ibijbH4 on persons subject to Bahrain \ Order in Council, who are guilty of an offence against the Dangerous Drugs Regulation. 2 . The Bahrain Government **r view witn much concern the increase in the habit of OV ary^ cQ. /fvfi using opium that the only way to check it is by taking drastic action and inflicting severe punishment. In their courts persons convicted of being in possession of opium or hashish are sentenced to 12 months R.I' and I have been ? asked if the Agency courts could not raise the maximum sentence which can be inflicted. 3. It will be observed from Article 71 Bahrain Order in Council and K. R. No. 1 of 1931 entitled Dangerous Drugs Regulations that Ahe maximum punishment which the Agency courts may inflict is a fine of Rs.1500/- and or 3 months R.I. 4. In view of the appalling effects of the use of hashish, of its continued use in Bahrain, and of the Bahrain Governments desire to stamp out the practice^ I am in agreement that the maximum punishment fixed by King*s Regulations as mentioned above is for too low. 3} recommend therefore that it be raised to 12 months Rigorous imprisonment and/or a fine of Ks.2,000/.2 5. If the Mil the Pelitic&amp;3- Hes3.dent o agrees with ay fiecoraaendation it will be necessary first to amend article 71 of the Bahrain Order in Council as this limits the punishment to 3 months and the fine th4t may be imposed for a breach of any Regulation mada under Article 70 to Rs,1,500.

Para 4 A high proportion of these summary cases consists of offences under Motor Vehicles rules, in respect of registrations, licenses etc. In none of the cases which I examined had the prosecution noted whether the accused was a first offender or not, a matter of importance in all cases, but particularly so in Motor Vehicles cases where a different scale of punishment operates for those who already have a previous conviction. In view of the considerable number of these cases, I would suggest that the introduction of the^system common in India, whereby a routine scale of fines for fir* first offences is laid down and the accused allowed to compound for this amount without appearance in Court, might be considered for adoption. As regards the suggestion made in the last para the Adviser may be asked for his comments. Id. M.A.H. / 2-12-46. ^ Ref. noteA 4 ?

I suggest we adopt the scale drawn up by I.A. in proceeding para, as a general guide, and ask Adviser to do the same in the Bahrain Courts. lWill P.A. please see the Bahrain Government’s Ehlan at s.36. Hitherto persons accused of selling alcoholic liquor to subjects of the Shaikh or to foreigners not permitted to purchase it have been prosecuted under Article 74 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council read with this Ehlan, This Ehlan is not particularly clearly expressed and is difficult to interpret in Court. The Shaikh has already approached a former P.A. in the subject and asked for heavy penalties for'^o^^ners convicted of trafficking in alcoholic liquor or drinking it (pages 58 &amp; 61 in C.O. file 32/2 - linked); and if the P.A. considers it worth while trying to make the law clearer so that foreigners can know how they stand in relation to it, perhaps he would consider moving the Resident to have a regulation under the Bahrain order-in-Council issued on the sub ject.
