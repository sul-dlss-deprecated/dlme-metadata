Hennell encloses a translation of a letter, dated 7 August 1850, which he has received from Mirza Jaffer Khan. In the translated letter, Mirza Jaffer Khan refers to a bugla [buggalow] belonging to a Mohumrah merchant, which has been detained at Bushire on the grounds that it was carrying slaves. Mirza Jaffer Khan argues that the vessel did not contain slaves and goes on to suggest that even if it did, this would not be a reason for detaining it, as the Persian Government has not as yet given up the practice of buying and selling slaves.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x00003f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
