January 14 1916 5824/16 • ^ SECRET Sir With reference to your letter, P.81, of the 10th instant, relative to the proposed agreement between the Allies and Djemal Pasha, I am directed by Secre tary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you, herewith, to be laid before Mr Secretary Chamberlain, the Draft of a Note which he proposes to address to the French Ambassador, informing His Excellency that His Majesty’s Government do not, for their part, propose to proceed any further in the matter. Sir Edward Grey would be glad to learn, at your early convenience, whether Mr Chamberlain concurs in the terms of the proposed communication. I am, Sir, Your most obedient The Under Secretary of State India Office.I Draft Note to French Ambassador. | »/ .* Your Excellency, Wiuh reference to Monsieur de Fleuriau’s pri vate letter to Sir A, Nicolson of the 6th instant, relative to the proposed understanding between the Allies and Djemal Pasha, which, it was suggested, might be undertaken by His Majesty*s Government, I have the honour to state that the negotiations which are at present proceeding between His Majes ty’s Government and the Sheriff of Mecca render it impossible for the former to take up this question, and that I do not, therefore, propose to proceed any further in the matter. A ^73. kt* hi™ iM C (fcijA £&amp;% &gt;r ' f.j JnJ: if, however, Your Excellency's Government consider it desirable to open negotiations with Djemal Pasha, I would suggest that, in view of the many French interests in Syria, interests which, as Your Excellency is aware, have already placed a limitation on the negotiations now being conducted with the Afabs, it would be preferable that the French Government should themselves undertake the conduct of the negotiations with Djemal Pasha, and keep His Majesty's Government informed from time to time of the results achieved. Your Excellency's Government will, moreover, be in a better position to impress on Djemal Pasha the importance of a preliminary arrangement with the Arabs, which would appear to be, as the French Government doubtless realize, the first essential of success. I have the honour etc. His Excellency Monsieur Paul Gambon. G.C.V.O.I— '* r ‘ — ■'I tram General, Force “ D,” Basra, 2nd January 1916.

The following inwXn^'L by a doctor who claims to have had friendly conversadons wit Jemal Pasha (a) Left Damascus fearing arrest c,i his friends had been executed uniler Jemal’s orders andlolW™^ Arabs,” include November'’ ^ stla niah, were arrested about 1st n ?&gt; n -i“ 11(l No y e ; n ] )ei ‘ returned from the opening of the Beer- shebah Railway and left for Aleppo on the same day, either to deal with a typhus epidemic, to meet \ on der Goltz, or to assist Fakhri Pasha who is having difficulty with the Armenians at Marash. (c) Only wood is now burnt on the Syrian railway. The result is that the journey I mm Damascus to Aleppo now takes three or four days instead of it hours. The Turks use rails and material of the French Houran railway to complete the Beershebah railway. No more material for the remaining 300 kilometres to the Canal and no rail was being made to Alarish. The gauge is still broken at Riyaq. In the opinion of the doctor the Beershebah railway is a bluff. He was told last August by Dickmann, a German railway official, that the Hejaz railway had been pronounced unlit for military traffic by the German military inspector. (d) At the railway station on 2nd November it is said that Jemal warned the Chef du Gare to have his rolling stock ready for the troops released from the Dardanelles, as they would be making another attack on Egypt in February. A short time before the doctor left suitable houses for military hospitals were selected by medical officers—3,00U beds at Aleppo and 2,500 at Damascus. Doctor thinks that this is all bluff. (e) Yassim Bey, Arab Chief of Staff to Fakhri Pasha, told him last June that there were not more than 200,000 Turkish troops in the Dardanelles. Turkey is now believed to possess not more than 000,000 troops. Orders have been given to recruiting authorities to accept unfit men. As all the men have been called to arms a famine is expected in Syria. Men are paid in I.O.U.’s, not money or notes. Since the beginning of the war, 70,000 Syrians are said to have deserted. The canal attack of last year was under taken by 30,000 troops, plus 5,000 or 0,000 volunteers, whose maximum loss was 1,250 killed and 500 prisoners. The remains of these troops were gradually railed northward. Subsequently four heavy guns of 14, 15, and 10 cm. calibre, which were dragged to the canal by buffaloes and 3,000 troops, were got back and sent to the Dardanelles. (/) He places Mahoud Mukhtar probably in Constantinople, Von der Goltz in Baghdad, Liman Sanders in Dardanelles, Zekki Pasha at Berlin, Fakhri Pasha at Marash and Jemal the younger in Jerusalem. (g) He says that the British would be welcomed by the Syrians. (/&lt;) He appears genuine but will be kept under observation. He reached Hit by camel caravan about 2nd December, coming via Deir, and thence by boat to Nasiriyah Says there are no signs of troops on the Euphrates line.

If, however, Djemal’s movement was to have any chance of success he must get the Arabs to side with him, and he ouo-ht to have an agreement with them. If he did that, our promises to the Arabs woukfbe satisfied by anything to which they themselves had willingly agreed. I observed to Fount Benckendor If that it would be necessary to consult the French Grovernment about Syria especially. On his asking about Italy, I said that, in order to see what the Italian require ments were, M. Sazonof should refer to the agreement that we had made with Italy when she entered into the war. I told Count Benckendorff that we had carefully abstained from any promises or discussion of the Caliphate.

Gasonow will doubtless give you full details. Y cu ma,y assure M. Sazonow tdiat, in so far as our ir~ teiests are concerned we have no objection to his enteiing incoimmunicution with Djemal Pasha through suen cnannels as he may consider to be the most suitable; and that we should not let any British claims stand ir. tie way of a negotiation with Djemal Pasha on the linen and conditions proposed. You should inform M. Sazonow tnat with the same ocject as tne Russian Government ha.ve in view we have, in response to overtures made to us, offered, as far as Arabia and some adjoining districts in the south are concerned, to support Arab claims if the Arabs will themselves break with the present Turkish Government and if the Arabs do tnis we must fulfil our promise to them. In discussions with the ^rabs we have carefully abstained from any discussions on, or giving any opinion in regard to, tne Caliphate, which we con sider is a matter exclusively for Moslems to settle among themselves, vve think, therefore, that Djemal snould come to sane arrangement wits tine Arabs; and in fact, his movementraoveiaent will imve .iO chance olsuccess unless he can detach the nra’os fraa tlae Turks. f There is one reservation which His Majesty*s in overiiment ious i make, and on which douhtless M. Sazonow will see tnat tnere will be no misunderstending, and that is that we have publicly announced tr^at Basrah v/ould never again be allowed to fail into Turkish hands. This promise, must be kept. There are one or two points to which you might draw i,.. Bazonow’s attention as perhaps worthy oi consideration.

This is a condition which it may be diificult to fulfil. I have no doubt that;.:, hazonow will let tie French Government know of the project for they are deeply Interested in all that concerns Syr .to and no engagsnents could be taken in respect to that region without the consent of France.
