It will be observed that in theae lists the goods in question are again shown classified according to the branch of Cable and Wireless Limited by which they were Imported. The gooda imported by each branch are further subdivided into four categories, according to their /feature.- 2 nature* In view of th® observationa contained in paragraph 3 of the Ministry^ memorandum No* 43820/464 of the 12th January (22nd Dey, 1315), the Company do not wieh to press for the refund of duty paid on goods falling vithin the fourth category, viss ^Requirements for accommodation and health maintenance of the Staff'* They are, however, confident that the Imperial Government will agree that the goods in the first three categories fall under Article 4, paragraph 2, of their Agreement, and will grant a refund of the duties paid by the Company on these goods, the amounts of which are shown in detail in the enclosed lists A to 5* At the same time X have the honour to transmit to Tour Excellency, herewith, two further lists of goods in respect of which the Company were forced to pay charges from which it is consid ered that they should have been exempt under paragraph 2 of Article 4 of their Agreement* The first of these lists (£) relates to goods Imported by the Charbar branch of the Company in December, 1934, which were eventually released by the customs free of duty and road tax, but upon which demurrage was charged* since the delay in /clearingclearing the goods was due solely to the action of the Customs in refusing to release any stores until the amount of guarantee letters vas paid, it seems clear that the Company are entitled to a refund of the sum of hials 347* 40 (Rials three hundred and forty seven and dinars forty) paid under protest in respect of demurrage. The second list (?) refers to a consignment of fans and oil lamps, required solely for office purposes and therefore exempt from duty, on which the Company were forced to pay Customs duty, road tax and demurrage, totalling Rials 1,041. 25.

They have instructed their local Manager accordingly. They would, however, point out that emergency requisitions may sometimes be required, as for instance in the case of a serious breakdown, where the necessary spare parts cannot always be kept in stock. They are confident that in such an eventuality articles required will be admitted free of duty, although not provided for in the lists submittea at the beginning of each year.

Having regard to the fact that messengers and linesmen employed at our Persian Gulf Branches wear their uniforms solely in connection with the performance of their duties, we consider that consignments of these uniforms when supplied should be granted free entry into Persia. However, in view of the small amount involved and the improbability of the Persian Authorities regarding the matter favourably, we do not feel disposed to press for exemption in respect of this item of expenditure. We are prepared, therefore, to leave the matter to the discretion of His Majesty's Minister at Teheran as you suggest. Yours truly. M.J. Clauson, Esq., B.A., India Office, S.W.l.If it would only l«»d to delay in obtaining a refund on the other it•?*•», it would probably be wiser not to pres* it* Before we take any action I should be glad if you would kindly let me know whether you agree to our taking this line.

TO BE ADDRESSED TO v 1(36) THE MANAGING DIRECTORS THE REFERENCE AND DATE OF THIS LETTER BEING QUOTED j,- Mgr/JLW/K. Dear Mr. Clauson, We have now considered Mr. Laithwaite's letter of the 15th instant in regard to the present attitude of the Persian authorities on the matter of importation of stores into Persia by this Company and as agreed during our telephone conversation I am addressing my reply to you. In broad principle we consider that all expenditure in con nection with the upkeep of our Cables, Landlines and Branches in the Persian Gulf should fall within the exemption mentioned in Article 4 (2) of the Telegraphs Agreement, whether such expenditure represents telegraphic instruments, apparatus, technical items, or general working expenses incurred in the maintenance of buildings or official requirements for the health-maintenance of the staff. We note that your latest communication from the Persian Government fails to specify the categories of articles which they are not prepared to admit free of duty and that the Persian Government now desire this Company to submit a revised list of stores. The list which was enclosed with Mr. Laithwaite’s letter has therefore been carefully examined and the items allocated under the following headings: 1. TELEGEAHI AND TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT, TELEGBAPH AND OTHER OFFICIAL STATIONERY, ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION SUNDRIES. We consider that these should unquestionably be granted free exemption. 2. UPKEEP AND WINTER HEATING OF THE BUILDINGS AND STAFF QUAiflEaS.s\ I Enel. 2 . We also consider that items under this heading should be admitted free as they are obviously necessary for general upkeep purposes. 3. UNIFORMS FOR TELEGRAPH MESSENGERS AND THE LINESMEN, ETC. Expenditure under this head must also be regarded as a general working expense and in our opinion the items thereunder should not suffer duty. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCOMMODATION AND HEALTH-MAINTENANCE OF THE STAFF. In view of the attitude of the Persian authorities towards the whole question of imports we should be prepared to waive our claim of exemption for items under this category, if the Con^any is granted free entry for stores under the other three categories. The list of stores referred to above is returned herewith together with further sheets showing the various items allocated under the above headings. We are willing to comply with the request of the Persian Government in regard to the future application of Article 4. of the Telegraphs Agreement and are accordingly instructing our Manager at Karachi to submit each year to the Imperial Government a complete list of the stores which it is anticipated will be imported during the year and which we consider should be granted free entity. In this connection, however, it should be pointed out that emergency requisitions are sometimes fonvarded to cover event ualities which cannot be foreseen, as, for example, a serious break down of plant or major parts for which spares are not normally stocked. We shall be obliged if you will again take up the matter with the Persian authorities on our behalf with a view to obtaining a more favourable interpretation of Article 4(2) in the Agreement.

A? any rate we should be glad if the Foreign/Foreign Office would now instruct the Minister to present the revised lists to the Persian Government with a request for a refund on categories 1 and 2, ^ 3.

The Persian Government's Note of January last to which I referred in my letter to you of 1st February, No. P.Z.664/35, stated that the Persian authorities had carefully examined the lists of the stores in question and had divided them into 'the three following categories:- (1) Goods in respect of which importation permits had been issued before 17th February, 1932, the date of the signature of the Telegraphs Agreement (kn which the J Persian Government agreed to a refund of the dues and taxes collected. (2) Good^ whether imported before or after the signature of the Telegraphs Agreement, on which the Persians refused to grant exemption (on the ground that they not directly connected with the working of the land lines, the cable and lX&gt;K. the offices, and therefore not, in 3761 5000 5.35T the opinion of the Persian Government, covered hy Article 4(2) of the Telegraphs Agreement), such as 'drugs, accessories of dispensaries, haberdashery, gramophones, primus stoves, flour, rice, coffee, whisky, sherry (?), meat conserves and vegetables, dried fruits, butter, 2»£rd Chubeh {turmeric), tambri- hindi (tamarind), vinegar, etc.'. (3) Goods, in respect of which importation permits had been issued since February 1932, on which the Persians agreed to a refund of the dues and taxes collected. Although the Persian note mentioned certain articles on which exemption of duty was refused, it failed to specify exactly the various categories of stores to which they referred. In view of this, the Minister at Tehran was instructed to ask the Persians for copies of the lists showing the three categories in question into which the stores had, according, to the Persian Government, now been divided, in order that Cable &amp; Wireless might be in a position to decide whether they wished further representations to be made regarding any article which they might regard as unreasonably excluded from exemption. The Legation addressed a further note to the Persian Government on 11th April in accordance with these instructions, to which the Persians replied on 13th April. Unfortunately, the latest Persian hote still fails to specify the various categories as requested/Draft Paper Department m? 2 . requested, and instead of this asks that the Legation should produce a revised list showing duties and charges paid by the Company on articles falling within the categories (1) and (3) above 'so that it may be verified and . %.« an order for V refund issued'. _ *7 ° In view of this senmo^fhat f there io now nothing for it but tfc^ 6&amp;C produce a revised list as requested by the Persian Government, after eliminating the items which might reasonably be regarded as coming under the second category specified by the Persians. In order that the Company may be in a better position to do this, I enclose herewith copies of the actual lists of stores communicated to the Persians with Sir Reginald Hoare^ note of 5th March, 1934. Incidentally, you will notide, that the total amount to-be refunded originally claimed from the Persians should have been Rs. 12,195.85, and not Rs. 11,195.85 as actually stated in Sir Reginald Hoare*s note. On receipt of a revised list from the Company, we shall approach the Foreign Office again and ask them to have it presented to the Persian °L Government in order that^refund^ft of duty may now be made. 3761 5000 5.35 4, With/V \ If' With regard to the application in future of the provisions of Article 4(2) of the Telegraphs Agreement, the Persian Governments latest note proposes iim a k e that Cable &amp; Witless shouldjm a k e up and forward at the beginning of every year a complete list showing the compan y! s and tho- requirements of the goods coming under exemption ”so that after being verified by the authorities concerned of the Imperial Government and certified as being required for the uses provided in the Agreement, the customs officers concerned would be notified to act accordingly.” ‘V sh4&gt;|J3*fbe glad ify,$£e _ ■u shoui^be' glad if Company, could ' ' ' let us know whether the^wauld see -nieir dCytc ^ 1 it. in- future as ths- to-do 'third PftrR.Sfln nnvgrnmon+. ^ 0 ^ 1100 +, -tU Gy* ^ Tour^ i, G.

Tou will remember that at the time of our discussion v/ith Captain Lawson on 31st January last (P. Z. 664/35), we had just heard from Tehran by telegram that the Persian Government had addressed a note to the Legation agreeing to the refund of dues and taxes levied on the stores imported by I. &amp; I• C. betv*een March, 1931 and March 1934, a list of which had been communicated to the Persians by Sir R. Hoare on 5th March, 1934, ''except in respect of such goods as medical material, personal effects and stores, which are not included under Article IV(2) of the Telegraphs Agreement'. We understood from Captain Lawson that Cable and Wireless would be prepared to acquiesce in a somewhat stricter interpretation of Article IV(2) of the Telegraphs Agreement so as to 'CXclude medical material etc., and in the payment of duty on such articles as might reasonably be regarded as excluded from exemption by such an interpretation. Captain Lawson suggested that if the Company knew positively to what articles the Persians took objection they could then draw up specimen lists and arrange their consignments accordingly, and it was agreed that we should wait for the text of the Persian note in the hope that it might indicate in detail the articles on which the Persians refused to grant exemption. The Persian note was received as an enclosure to the Foreign Office letter of 1st Msjj^at P.Z. 1449/35. The note stated that the Persian authorities had divided the listrof stores enclosed in Sir R. Hoare's note to the Persian Government/Government of 5th March, 1934, into the three following categories (1) Goods in respect of which importation permits had been issued before 17th February, 1932, the date of the signature of the Telegraphs Agreement^ on which the Persian Government agreed to a refund of the dues and taxes collected. (2) Goods whether imported before or after the signature of the Telegraphs Agreement on which the Persians refused to grant exemption such as 'drugs, accessories of dispensaries, haberdashery, gramaphones, primus stoves, flour, rice, coffee, whisky, sherry (?), meat conserves and vegetables, dried fruits, pepper, sard* Chubeh (Turmeric) » tambri-hindi (Tamarind) vinegar, etc. (3) Goods in respect of which importation permits had been issued since 17th February 1932, on which the Persians agreed to a refund of the dues and taxes collected. Although the Persian note mentioned certain articles on which exemption from duty was refused, it failed to specify exactly the various categories of stores to which it referred. In view of this the Minister at Tehran was instructed to a$k the Persians for copies of the Lists showing the three categories in question into which the stores had, according to the Persian Government’s note,been divided, in order that Cable and Wireless might be in a position to decide whether they wished further representations to be made regarding any article which they might regard as unreasonably excluded from exemption. The Legation addressed a further note to the Persians on 11th April in accordance with these instructions to which the Persians replied on 13th May. The texts of the two notes/^1 Jsc iU. notes are enclosed in the Tehran despatch of 12th June now received (P.Z. 4712/35). The Persians have faiJed to specify the various categories as requested and instead of this they ask that the Lsgation should produce a revised list showing the duties and charges paid for articles falling within the categories (1) and (3) above M so that it may be verified and an order for refund issued”. The onus of eliminating the items which might reasonably be regarded as coming under the second category specified by the Persians, has thus been laid on the Company. The Tehran despatch also encloses copies of the complete lists of stores furnished to the Persians /• with Sir R. Hoare’s note of 5th March, 1934. It appears uhat we must now ask the Company to produce a revised list ( j as requested by the Persians.

It will be observed that the Iranian Government, instead of furnishing themselves a list of the stores on which they are willing to refund customs dues,ask that a list should be prepared and submitted by His Majesty’s Legation. 5. As the exact stores on which a refund ii to be claimed would appear to be a matter for the company to decide, I have the honour to enclose copies of the lists of stores which were transmitted to the Iranian Government under cover of Sir R.H. Hoare’s note No. 109 of March 6th, 1934, with the request that I may receive instructions as to which are the items on which the Company now wish to press their claim for a refund. 4.

His Majesty's Government agree that there must be a reasonable limit to the stores which can be held to be covered by Article 4 (2) of the Agreement, but as it is often a matter of some difficulty to estimate how far an article is directly connected with the work of maintaining the land line, the cable or the offices, they would be grateful if they might receive copies of the lists showing the three categories into which, according to the Ministry's memorandum, the stores have been divided, in order that they may be in a position to offer further explanations regarding any article at present excluded from the benefit of Article 4 (2) which they consider could fairly be held to be covered by that Article.AncloBure No» 2 in Tehran deepatch No» 350 of 12th June, 1935» Translation } 9ron the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sconoalos Department) addressed to His Majesty's Legation.

Memorandum. I The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Imperial Government, with reference to the memorandum of Murdad 9th (July 31st 1934) No. 498 of His Majesty's Legation enclosing permits (acquits d 1 entree) issued for the consignments of the al Imperial and Internation Communications Company, have the honour to state that the permits in question, which are now returned herewith, have been carefully examined by the competent quarters and have been classified in the three following categories after their contents have been read in the light of the provisions of section 2 of Article 4 of the Telegraphs Agreement on which His Britannic Majesty 1 s Legation have relied. 7 The first category consists of the permits (acquits d f entree) which have been issued for the importations dst ing before Bahman 27th 1310 (February 17th 1932) which is the date of the signature of the Agreement and in view of the absence of the issue of the permits the relevant goods were imported of special provisions at the time/and used after the payment of dues and taxes. But since by virtue of paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the said agreement, both parties have agreed to consider the provisions of same as binding on March 1st, 1931, the competent quarters consider that there will be no impedi ment as to the refund of the dues and taxes collected. The second category consists of the permits which have been issued before or after the signature of the said agreement in respect of the goods which do not enjoy the exemption laid down, such as drugs, accessories of dispensaries, haberdashery,nut haberdashery, gramophones, primus (stoves, personal effects and stores, soap, flour, rice, coffee, whiskey, sherry (?), meat conserves and vegetables, dried fruits, pepper, zard chubeh (turmeric) tambri-hindi (Tamarind), vinegar etcetera, it is evident that these articles do not come under w the stores, tools and accessories which are required for the working of land-line and the submarine cable and their of fices” and cannot be exempt from payment of taxes and duties while basing on section 2 of Article 4 of the Agreement. The dues and taxes levied on such stores cannot therefore be refunded. ll The third category consist of permits issued after B&amp;hman 27th, 1310 (February 17th 1932) relating to the stores, accessor ies and tools which were imported for the working of the company and which ought rightly to have been exempted from payment of taxes and dues at the very time that the permits were issued, but the Company did not, according to the usual practice, apply beforehand, throu#i the central authorities, for exemption; and the loci customs officials levied taxes and duties owing to the non-receipt of special instructions in the matter. As regards the last category of permits, although these permits were issued by reason of the failure of the Company’s officials to perform the preliminary formalities, the competent quarters of the Imperial Government agree to the refund of the dues levied. As the Honourable Legation will agree, the utmost goodwill has been shown in the compliance with the request made by the Legation in respect of the permits issued for the consignments imported for the Imperial and International Communications Company.

I note with pleasure that the Persian Authorities have agreed to refund the duty paid in respect of certain items, and we are now awaiting the full text of the Persian Authorities' reply. It is hoped that this report when received may clarify the position as to the particular items they consider to be excluded under the clause in the agreement, and my Company could then decide whether it would be justified in asking you to further press the matter. Regarding the stores held up at Char bar under the letter of Guarantee ( concerning which I wrote you on 1st November), I have pleasure in confirming that these have now been released without payment of duty.

The report in question has reached us by telegraph ana we have not yet haa the text of the Persian reply, 2. We have had no information as to what has happened in regaru to the stores imported under the letter of guarantee at Charbar, to which reference is maae in your letter of 1st November, reference IMS/JLW, but I understand from you that these stores (including the electrolyte anu~ coaltar) have now in fact been released witnout payment of duty. To-Ul, (h. CJ(2?r £fc&gt;'s~ CtL * 3. I explained to you tne difficulties which have arisen in i»800 5000 5.34 connection/connection with the interpretation of Article IV(2) of the Telegraphs Agreement. The position is briefly that the Persians have officially informed us that in tneir view it applies only rt to those things which are considered as telegraph accessories ana which are essential for the proper functioning of the telegraph work* and we are advised that as a matter of strict interpretation it might he difficult to contest this view. While it would, of course, he possible to take the matter to arbitration the risk that the decision might not be in favour of the Company cannot be overlooked ana the reference in any event could not fail to involve expenditure. In these circumstances^ unless (which I understand from you is not the case) any large sum is involved, there seems nothing for it but to acquiesce in the Persian contention ana to pay auty on goods such as medical material, personal effects, etc. 4. You suggested, I think, that the simplest course in these circumstances might be that a list should be prepared either of tne articles wnigh tne pereians eifner were pr^yarau to admit auty Tl’uu undui Luimu'uf Aytiole jv/ P' 1*^/&lt; * U. £¥('£■) which thety claim te^-he dutiable/-—'\ r J P2- &gt; Note of aiscussion with Captain Lawson ( ^ e ^^ a£ Cahle and Wireless, Ltcu, on Thursday, 31st January, 1935| ^ &amp;&lt; ^ nr &lt;wCCy - 4 lfefi&gt;rc^ OT^ &lt;Mv'tA. ^ A Gf3z Please see the minutes on P.Z&gt;6793/34 hQleir\ ana the Foreign Office letter of 12th December* on P.Z.7608/34. &amp;. Captain Lawson callea by appointment to-aay to discuss the situation and it was explained to him that we had just heard that the Persian Government had agreed to refuna the dues and taxes levied on the stores imported by I.&amp; I.C. between torch 1931 and torch 1934, the list of which had been communicated to the Persians by sir R. Hoare on torch 5th last, 'except in respect of such goods as medical material, personal effects and stores, which are not included under Article IV (2) of the Telegraphs Agreement'. We had communicated Captain Lawson's letter of 1st November, IliS/JLW, in connection with the refuna of duty on certain stores for which a letter of guarantee had been given at Charbar, to the Foreign Office but naa not yet heard the result. 3. Captain Lawson took note of the position in regard to the refund on the stores, etc. covered by Sir R. Hoare’s Note. As regards the Charbar consignment he said that he thought that importation had now been permitted without payment of duty. This covered electrolyte, etc. 4. I said that the second point which we wished to discuss with him was the Persian construction of Article IV (2) of the Telegraphs Agreement. They had informed us in August 1934 that in their view that article applied 'only to those things which are considered/a considerea as telegraph accessories ana which are essential for the proper functioning of the telegraph work*, and their latest Note suggestea that they proposea to maintain this attitude. 5. H.M.G. were anxious to help tne Company so far as possible and they had carefully considered the legal position. As a result they were advised that the Persian Government could probably make out a plausible case for their construction of the relevant article of the Agreement and while it woula of course be possible to take the matter to arbitration there seemed reason to , 4U-* k- tk. + doubt whether was worth while, particularly if the sums involved were small. The issue of an arbitration might be uncertain ana there could be no question that it would cost money. Our position was not strengthenea by the fact that, as the Company were aware, we haa been apprehensive at the time of the signature of the Agreement that difficulties might arise on this very point but that it had been aecided that it would be undesirable to hold up signature of the Agreement merely so that we could endeavour to strengthen the terms of Article IV(£). 6. Captain Lawson said that the Company, as this was an agreement between two Governments, had always been anxious to a void any action (such as acquiescing in the payment of duty to Persia) which might be regarded as compromising any question of principle covered by the Agreement. He did not think that the amounts involved were at all substantial# I gathered that the Company woulafbe prepared to acquiesce in payment of auty on such items as the Persian Government could reasonably regard as falling outside the scope of Article IV(2). He sugge ste d/f &amp; suggested that the Company's operations would he greatly facilitated if they knew positively to what articles the Persians took exception. They could then draw up a specimen list and arrange their consignments accordingly• method of dealing with the matter and suggested that we might wait until the full text of the Persian reply referred to in para.E above had been received. This might indicate in greater detail to what articles the Persians W J* p* CA. U UcXa. (Xa. piu. |tL MA / l « took exception^.' In’ the meantime, I would write him a d.o. letter confirming the statements made to him in the interview. 8. Wireless stores for Bushire and Hen.lam. Captain Lawson enquired the position in regard to the import of stores for these two stations. He was informed that the position was unchanged. He said that as from 31st December the operation of a spark set, such as existed at Bushire, was in fact no longer in order and that he would write to us further on this question. He understood that local arrangements, though not of a very satisfactory type, had been maae by the staff of Cable and Wireless, which enabled them to maintain communication with Henjam, though there might be difficulty over communication with ships. 7 I said that this seemed the most satisfactory 111 1CIn any further communication on this subject, please quote ^ Xo - El ^ ^ i address —not to any ptrton by name, but to— “The Under-Sechetary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. v- ! ‘664 ' - r V*' 1 tt I | Q 3 O j THE Under-Secretary of State for Foi*eTgir LATfairS'“presents bis -*—C- compliments to c\ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copv^^ ^of the under-mentioned paper.■■I ■ fp@) .664 j 1935 ) Decode NO DISTRIBUTION .

As difficulties were being experienced at the, time over the importation of stores, the question was considered whether it would not be advisable to press the Persian Government to widen the scope of the clause either by interpretation or by amendment of the text, but in order to avoid delay Mr. Dodd decided to submit the draft text as it stood and then refer the matter to the Marquess of Reading, which he did in his despatch No. 482 of the 9th September, 1931. 2. Later, in reply to Lord Reading's telegram No. 161 of the 22nd October, 1931, Sir R.H. Hoars maintained, in his despatch No. 666 of the 21st November, 1931, that the only satisfactory solution would be to amend the text of the article, but that the adoption of this course would not be worth while on account of the delay involved.

TEHRAN. 12th December, 1934. 33v My dear Lacy, Your letter to the Chancery, No. E 5951/645/34 of the 18th October about customs duty on stores imported by the Imperial and International Communications Company. Our despatch No. 536 of to-day gives such information as we have been able to glean as a result of a search of the archives at the time of the negotiations leading up to the signature of the 1932 Telegraph Agreement. It does not, I fear, lend much support to a claim for a more generous interpretation of Article 4 (2). 2. As regards the position at the time of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, Bushire’s reply to the enquiry that you mention was to the effect that all consignments addressed officially to one of the Department's stations were admitted free of duty. 3. Nevertheless, our archives show that disputes, very similar to those which we have now, did in fact take place in 1927 and 1928 as to what stores the Department were entitled to import free of duty. The following passage from a letter dated November 16th, 1927 from the then Manager, New, to Warner, gives the Department’s views:- ”1 think we should stick out that all material of 'any kind whatsoever for the service of the line must L. Baggallay, Esq., The Foreign Office, London. 'bemmm ’’be exempt, whether it he for lines, offices, or ’’anything else. Everything brought into this country ”hy the Indo-European Telegraph Department is brought ”in for the service of the line we maintain.' The Persian Government disagreed and interpreted the phrase to refer only to such objects as were connected with the telegraph wire itself. 3. Discussions continued to take place between the Department and the Persian Government, and a note which v/e sent to the Persian Government in September, 1928, mentioned the fact that New reached a verbal agreement with the Prime Minister as to what constituted articles ’’for the service of the line” and that at a later date the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs wrote to him asking for a list of these articles, which he then sent. V/e do not seem to have a copy of this list nor can we trace any further mention of the agreement. Apparently the question of customs exemption for the Department from about that time onwards was overshadowed by the Persian challenge to the validity of the concessions under which the Department operated. 4. I must apologise for our delay in replying but it has taken some time to search through the files and we have been pretty busy in other directions as well.

We could only aenounce at tne cost of leaving tne cable offices and this section of the Jask-Gwaaur line in Persian hands. I do not know that this would matter very much if we were in fact able to do without them, but as suggested in my minute of 13th November, the effect on our own communications would have to be carefully considered. should in practice no doubt avoid a formal denunciation and warn the Persians that they were making it impossible for the Company to carry out their obligations under the agreement and that in these circumstances it might be impossible for them to carry on unless a more reasonable 3 If conditions became really intolerable we attitude/attitude was adopted by the central authorities. The Persians would have only themselves to thank; if, after such representations, the Company gave notice that they were unable to discharge their obligations, and on the assumption that they could prove that Persian obstruction had been so great as to make the position impossible I do not think there would be any risk of a successful claim for damages against them by the Persians. The Foreign Office, I understand, are disposed to agree. But there are, of course, arguments of much force against action on these lines unless it is quite inevitable. 4.

FOROUGHI.Minute Paper political Department Mr. L( * 9^ K ^ y ^ (A-L ^ 2621 6000 3 34 Please see P.0, letter of 18th October enclosing a copy of a despatch from Tehran and the letter from Captain Lawson of Cable and Wireless Ltd. to Mr. Laithwaite of 1st November below. The Tehran Legation are having great difficulty in inducing the Persian Government to take a reasonable view on the question of the importation of stores by Cable and Wireless for the use of their cable stations in the Persian Gulf, and the Minister has no doubt that the Persian Government will refuse to accept &gt;*wx^ of the items in dispute as eligible for tax exemption x under Art.4(2) of the Telegraphs Agreement. The relevant clause reads as follows:- 'Le Gouvernement Bersifcn exemptera des -et ' e droits de douane^de touts autres taxes quelconques le material et les appareils necessaires au bon fonctionnement tant de la ligne terrest^e que dee cables et stations de c^ble.' aydZchs The Legation have hitherto argued that such fequest# as staff uniforms and medicines are as necessary for the proper upkeep of the cables and cable stations as purely telegraph stores, but the P.O. are advised that the clause in the Agreement is too ambiguous for an appeal to arbitration to be worth while, and that the Persian Govt, have at least a plausible case in insisting on a stricter interpretation of the text. therefore consider that unless there is anything in the correspondence prior to the conclusion of the Agreement to show that a wider construction should be placed on the text, it will be necessary to inform the Company that/- 2 - that- they must pay duty on all articles except those directly connected with the work of maintaining the cables (including, presumably, the cable atations) # From the correspondence on our files which led up to the signature of the Agreement it seems improbable that j anything of value will be discovered in the archives of the Tehran Legation, since the Minister at Tehran expressed the view in Nov. 1931 that a further attempt to reach an understanding with the Persian Govt, as to the interpretation of Art.4(2) prior to the conclusion of the Agreement would do no good (Flag U in the attached file). . i The Company were informed of this in Mr. Clauson's letteif of January 1932 (Flag T) and seem to have acquiesced in the Minister*s view. On the other hand it will be seen from Captain Lawson*s letter that the Persian Govt.are demanding payment of duty on such articles as electrolyte, coal-tar and stationery which, glvcja. a strict interpreta tion of the text, would appear to qualify for exemption under the terms of Art. 4(2). Electrolyte and coal-tar are clearly 'necessaires au bon fonctionnement de la and office stationery, which has previously been exempted by the Persian Govt., might strictly be regarded, I think, as necessary for the proper functioning of the cable stations. The amount of money involved does not appear to be much and we can, I think, agree with the F.O. in deprecating an appe.al to arbitration.'^ Consignments which have recently formed the subject of correspondence with the Persian Govt, appear to be as follows:- (1) A list of supplies imported since 1st March 1931 for the Company*s stations at Bushire, Henjam, Jask and Charbar on which dues and road taxes have been paid and on which the Legation are asking for a refund of Rials 11,195.85. (P.Z.3135/34). (2) Two consignments of office stationery for the stations at Jask and Bushire (P.Z .3135/34(b)and 3255/34). It app&amp;ars that the Persians have P.Z VfQ II now a Sreed to exempt the Jask consignment and -fT since the cases seem to be on all fours it is ^ to/ IcJU n. , r .. i ^ ^ r ^ I 'Ct* JDepartment. Minute Paper. 3 to be hoped that they will also agree to exempt the Bushire ccnsignment. (3) Two consignments imported for the station at Charbar in December 1932 and January 1933. No duty has actually been paid yet on these stores which were imported under letters of guarantee, but duty is still being demanded by the Persian authorities. The December consignm forms the subject of Captain Lawson*s letter and it appears that the duty demanded amounts to Rials 1,703.15. The total sum involved^does not appear to be much more than about £150. Mr. Laithwaite has sent an interim reply to Captain Lawson and it is submitted that we might now write to the F.O. in reply to their letter of 18th October as in the draft attached which is, I think, self-explanatory. * ivc OIL CV&gt;ry^/K. — KUyiJ-l* ztv- 2621 6000 3 34Draft Paper £ f.Y.ajs/sf fit Department.

November f 7 ^ TER BEING QUOTED ^ ^ ^ ms/J im -ff Dear Mr. Laithwaite, I ain sorry to trouble you a^ain on the matter of customs duty on telegraph stores imported for our Persian Gulf Branches, but as you will see from the enclosed copies of three communications recently received from our Manager, the position seems to be unchanged. Notwithstanding the request, on our behalf, made through the India Office for the withdrawal of the demand i for duty on the stores sent to Charbar in December 1932, the Persian Gulf authorities are apparently still unwilling to release the stores, for which a letter of guarantee was given, without payment cf the duty demanded viz.. Rials 1703.15 (approximately £23). These stores include various items for normal use at Branches, but two items, namely. Electrolyte and coal tar,are urgently required if the necessary landline work is to be undertaken this season. Furthermore, in view of the fact that an additional supply of landline stores shipped from here about the middle of September should now have arrived, we are anxious to know what attitude is being adopted by the Authorities. We are, of course, desirous not to take any action which would affect the agreement between the British J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., Political Department, INDIA OFFICE, S.W.l.Government and the Persian Government, and should welcooie your further advioe and assistance. Yours sincerely. General Manager# ENCLOSURES' - 2 by our agreement and supplies subsequently received have been imported at Charbar and elsewhere free of duty. The Kesident Bush ire lias been asked to do his utmost to have this matter settled. In the meantime we are not paying the amount claimed. When at Bushire last January we raised the point as to the advisability of paying duty under protest and the Itesident disagreed with the adviee previously given and agreed this should not be done except in the case of medicines. Since then no duty has been paid other than on drugs. If demanded on material essential for telegraph working the Director of Posts and Telegraphs Teheran, as well as the Resident has been asked to take up the matter and usually it has been soon cleared up.

In reply to our service message N/LF September a copy of which was forwarded to you with our KE.275 of 20.9.34, the Minister wires that there is no alternative but to pay the amount of the letters of guarantee in order to release stores.

Sir, Witn reference to India Office letter P.Z* 4903/34 of 14tn August and to previous correspondence on the subject of the payment of customs duty on stores imported into Persia by Gable and V/ireless Limited for use at their cable stations in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran showing that the Persian Government are unlikely to abandon their view that only telegraph accessories in the most literal sense are entitled to exemption from duty under Article 4(2) of the Agreement of 17th February, 1932. 2. Sir John Simon is advised that this paragraph is too ambiguous for an appeal to arbitration to be worth while and that the Persian Government have at least a plausible case in regard to it. If it were merely a question of interpreting the words H necessaires au bon fonctionnement” it might be possible to show that medicines, uniforms and so forth came within this category, and if the words preceding this phrase were of a more general character there would be no reasonable doubt that this interpretation was correct. As it is, the material words to be interpreted are ’'materiel' and 'appareil' and these certainly suggest something limited to the actual functioning of the cables and cable stations. It is true that the word 'materiel' is trai slated The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. 43 25 OCT 193 rrrr—r - r. INDIA ctranslated as 'stores” in the English text, hut the French text is the valid text; in any case, although 'materiel' is capable of bearing this meaning, it is doubtful whether its ordinary meaning is so wide, and the underlying idea is probably nearer 'technical material' than 'stores'. It might conceivably cover uniforms, but not medicines, at any rate in the case of an institution that was not primarily medical in character. 3. Unless, therefore, there is anything in the correspondence leading up to the conclusion of the Agreement which would throw light upon the point. Sir John Simon is inclined to think a court would not place a wider construction on the passage than was necessary to give reasonable effect to the Agreement. It is obvious that the narrower meaning will not do actual violence to the Agreement: moreover, the Agreement is a financial one, in so far as it relates to exemptions from customs duty, and financial agreements are normally construed strictly. 4. His Majesty*s Minister at Tehran is being asked in a despatch of which a copy is also enclosed whether there is any passage in the preliminary correspondence which throws light upon the question, but even if the reply should be favourable Sir John Simon would still doubt whether the question were of sufficient importance to take to arbitration, assuming that a way of doing so could be found. Much would depend, however, upon the magnitude of the sums involved, and he would be glad to receive Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare*s views upon this aspect of the question. 5. If 9 however, the reply from Sir Reginald Hoare is unfavourable, Sir Samuel Hoare will doubtless agree that arbitration would be too risky a course for adoption by His Majesty’s Government, who would thus have no alternative but toto inform Cable and Wireless Limited that they must pay Persian customs duty upon all articles imported for use at the cable stations except those directly connected with the work of maintaining the cables* I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,No. 409 4th September* 1954. British Legation Gtulhek. Sir In continuation of my despatch No. 507 of June £3rd last, I hare the honour to report that I am experiencing great difficulty in inducing the Persian OOTemaent to take a reason able Tiew in the question of the importation of stores by the Imperial and International Communications Company* s stations in the Persian Gulf. 2. Under Article 4 (2) of the agreement of February 17th 1932, the Persian Government undertakes to exempt from customs dues and all other taxes *le materiel et les appareils n^cessaires au bon fonctionnement •••••. de la ligne* 9 . 3. As I reported in my despatch under reference, I have supplied the Ministry for Foreign Affair* wiuh a list of the duties paid in error in the past by the Imperial and Inter national Communications Company. I have requested a refund of these sums but have not yet received any reply. 4. From various indications, however, I have no doubt that the reply, when it comes, will consist in a refusal to treat most of the importations mentioned in the list as 'n^cessalres au bon fonctionnement de la ligne*. Meanwhile the Department of Commerce are consistently refusing to grant franchise to such consignments as medicines or uniforms for the company*s employees. In the circumstances I have seen no The Foreign Office- 2 - Persian Gulf the telegraa of which I enclose a copy. *&gt;• The difficulty essentially is to /draw a line between those stores which are necessary for the upkeep of the line /f Ca &amp;&lt;&amp;/ ti - rHl*77 and those which ar* not. Broadlyn^ei»rfiiTMid this is the ▼iew I have always upheld with the Persian Government, such iteas as aedical stores or uniforas are as essential as wire or electric equipaent. The service on the line cannot be maintained unless the staff is in good health and adequately clothed, hence the necessity for the importation of cloth and medicines. 6# On the other hand it is perfectly possible to maintain that by 'le materiel et les appareils**, is meant only the wire, tools. Instruments and accessories actually employed on the line. This is the view held by the Persian Government as will be seen from the note of August 19th, of which I have the honour to enclose a translation, and though I am in oral discussions still refusing to admit its validity, I have very little hope of inducing them to abandon it. My difficulties are Increased in this as in most other questions by the fact that I receive no assistance from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs which merely passes on my letter to the competent department and later transmits their reply without expressing any views. 7. I am, therefore, regretfully being driven to the conclusion that there exist no means whereby I can Induce the Persian Government to modify their views and in the circumstances I fear it may be necessary for the Company to resign themselves to paying duty on all consignments except strictly telegraphic accessories and stores. In order to avoid confusion it will /bel&gt;« advisable in the future for the Company's local stations to send in two series of applications, the first for telegraph stores and the second for other stores and private inportations 8 * I shall be grateful if the question can be discussed with the Company and instructions sent to me. 9 * I am sending a copy of this despatch to the acting rolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 158).

The Minister/Minister has also mentioned that while he requested the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf in July 1933 to obtain from the Company’s local representatives details of the sums paid, Colonel Powle was unable, in spite of every effort, to obtain this information until February 1934, seven months later. I think it only fair to let you have this information in view of its relevance to the questions which have been under discussion.

His Kxeellency Kazemi requested that he be furnished with the actual receipts ('acquits d'entrle) given to the Company by the customs authorities. I have requested the Political Keaident in the Persian Gulf to obtain these but some little time is bound to elapse before they can be collected from the various stations. 2* Meanwhile, Colonel Fowle has forwarded to me the acquits d’entrde for two consignments of stores imported by the station at Charbar on December 24th 1932 and January 19th 1953. Ho duty was actually paid on these stores which were imported under letters of guarantee, but duty is being demanded so I have requested the Acting Minister for foreign Affairs to see xhat this demand is withdrawn. 3* In regard to the future I have, after tedious semi-official negotiations, come to an arrangement with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by which the customs stations concerned receive instructions not to levy duty on any official stores. All attempts to persuade the Depart ment of Commerce to mark the licences '•free of duty* failed; i /w&gt; 2 AUQ, ia34 The Might Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., NO. 31l FROM FiCfitTAr.V, r SECRET DEPT. ■ The Foreign Office.no doubt owing to aone typically Persian suspicion that there was **a catch soaewhere 1 *. I hawe therefore perforce had to reaain content with the rather unsatisfactory arrangesent detailed above and have requested the Political Resident to report to ae at once by telegraph should any further diffi culties occur. X will then take up the case with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 4. I venture to add that X should feel greater sympathy with the Company in the difficulties they have experienced, if they had informed this Legation fron the outset that duty was being levied on their official stores. The customs authorities collected duty from Kerch 1st 1931, when the Imperial and International Communications Company took over from the Indo-European Telegraph Department, but the Political P.esident informs me that it was apparently only in August 1938 that the local stations learnt that official stores were, - under the agreement, - exempt from duty, ftad the London office of the Company brought the terms of the agreement to the notice of their local agents at the time of signature, infinite trouble would have been saved and financial loss avoided. Moreover, while I request ed the Political Resident, in July 1933, to obtain details of the sums paid, he was unable, in spite of every effort, to obtain this information until February 1934, seven months later. For thls delay again the Company have only themselves to thank. I will not fail to report in due course the reply of the Persian Government to my representations but as X /havehave indicated* this la bound to be delayed for 8o*e time as the relevant receipts have not yet reached iae. 6.

The attached letter, with its accompaniments from the I.&amp; 1.0., deals with two matters, (l) the importation of telegraph stores under Article 4 ( para.2) of the Anglo-Persian Telegraph Agreement and (2) the importation; duty free, of stores for the Wireless Station. As regards (l), it appears that the Company have four grounds of complaint at present, viz., (a) that there is great delay in obtaining the necessary licences from the Persian Government to enable stores to be imported, (b) that unless the licences,when obtained, are endorsed ’’Free of duty' full duty has to be paid before clearance is allowed, (c) that duty is in many cases being paid 'under protest', with the intention of subsequently claiming refunds, and ( d) that the Persian Government do not interpret the provisions of Article 4(2) of the Telegraph Agreement as covering drugs. You will remember that the difficulties experienced by the Company in importing stores for the telegraph stations prior to the entry into force of the Telegraph Agreement wete the subject of representations through the diplomatic channel in 1931, vide your file attached. In their telegram to Mr.Hoare of the 22nd October, 1931 (P.Z.6737/31) the Foreign Office instructed him to endeavour to secure an understanding with the Persian Government that the interpretation of Article 4(2) of the Agreement should include not only technical equipment but also articles essential for the physical well-being of the personnel at the Cable Stations, e.g.,medical necessities and official s^res, but not to delay the signing of the Agreement on this account. In a despatch dated 21st November, 1931, (P.Z.8044/31), Mr.Hoare in advising that it was undesirable at that juncture to ask for such an interpretation of that Article pointed out that the Persians had had no chance of rejecting any medical necessities, with the possible exception of brandy, and that if at any time they did reject medical necessities he should propose to take up the question strongly, provided always that/ it could be shown that it was right that the Company should import these necessities officially, rather than that the employees should do so privately. The question was not thereafter pursued. Prom the correspondence now forwarded by the Company it seems, however, that not only has the signing and ratification of the Agreement not solved the Company’s troubles but that the Persian Government have notified the Minister that they do not interpret Article 4 of the Treaty as covering drugs, etc., imported by the Company, and the Minister, in informing the Resident at Bushire to this effect, has expressed the opinion that drugs seem to him a borderline case and he is not sure whether he can really claim that they are 'Necessaires au bon fonctionnement” of the lines Thus, apparently, he does not hold such strong views on the subject as did his predecessor. As the previous complaint of the Company was dealt with by you you will perhaps^consider what action is desirable to assist the Company with a view to removing the difficulties which they are experiencing, but I venture to suggest that if representations are again made through the diplomatic channel the claim of the Company that the medicinal requirements are essential toMinute Paper. Department. 2 . the operation of the telegraph system in the Gulf should be strongly supported. As regards the other matter dealt with in the Company’s letter, viz., the importation, duty free, of wireless stores,! presume that the position now is the same as that in October, 1933, when we informed the Company (vide E.&amp; 0.7408/33) that the present time was not a favourable one for reopening this question with the Persian Government, and that forthe present we are unable to add anything to thab reply.

As will be seen from the enclosed copies of correspondence recently received from our Manager in the Persian Gulf, the whole question of the clearance of stores for our Branches there (both Wireless and Cable) is causing considerable inconvenience to my Company. We are unable to obtain the special permit from Teheran on which the Persian Government agreed to allow the ing&gt;ort of telegraph stores free of duty. We agree with our Persian Gulf Manager that the payment of customs duty 'under protest' is unsatisfactory and should be discontinued, as we feel that the practice creates an undesirable precedent* As the matter has now become urgent I beg to request that the Secretary of State for India will be good enough to assist my Conpapy in securing the privileges which should be afforded to it as Agent of His Majesty's The Under Secretary of State for India, Economic and Overseas Department, INDIA OPFlCSSt S.W.l*Government for the working of the Telegraph business ■ JSO in the Persian Gulf and as provided for in paragraph : v* 3 4 I 2 of Article 4 of the Telegraph Agreement dated the —— * 17th February 1932 between His Majesty's Government and the Government of Persia, I am.

Road tax and demmurage as the authority from Teheran for free importation was not received* The matter was represented through the Political Resident but no satisfactory answer up to the present has been obtained from the Persian Government. The Resident has sup ested that | the payment of Customs duty when unavoidable may be continued *under protest % vide correspondence attached. For all the Company's stores v/e import, we have to arjuly for a licence, submitting a list with values for each and every item, which takes anything up to six months to obtain; and unless this licence has written on it 'free of duty*, r/e are unable to clear the stores unless full duty is paid by us* There are at present some stores lying in Customs at Jask and Chnrbar imported under licence over a year ago but we have not been able to release them as special permission from Teheran for exemption of duty has not been received. \ve feel, that if we continue to pay duty even 'under protest', it will have an adverse effect on our concession of freefree importatioa* &lt;360 ! ! 9 3 A ^ith regard to duty on drugs amd medical storea, wt aider the health of the Staff is as imrortaat for the efffccieat working of the Cables as stores, aad therefore the free importa tion of drugs, is covered by the Agreement; and so cannot agree with His Britannic Majesty's Minister Teheran's contention that drugs are on the border line in determining whether they are covered by the agreement or not; as. Article i;, para 2 clearly states that the Persian Government will allow free of Customs duties and all other taxes whatever the material and Apparatus necessary to the good working of the landlines, Submarine Cab les and Cable Stations, Mr,3unker on his arrival at Bushire is going into the matter thoroughly with the Residort, and states he strongly disagrees entirely in the policy of paying duty and claiming a refund. He will also report on Officer-in-Charge Bushire's suggestion of the Company paying Dr.Naficy Teheran, who carried out the registration of the Company with the Persian Government being given a retaining fee for attending to the Company's work at Teheran such as forwarding applications for permits. Licen ces Registration etc. This Section of the Company has been carrying out the agreement with the Persian Government to the letter, but you will see from the above, that the Persian Government do not appear to be willing to carry out their part of the agreement, as regards Importation of the Company's stores; so, we there fore ask if you will kindly refer the matter to the Foreign Office asking thee* help in this matter.

With reference to ivir. lia^ner's telephone request to-day, regarding the import into Persia, free of Customs Duty, of such materials as may be requireu for the upkeep of the wireless stations at Bushire and Henjam, it is of course difficult to state exactly what the requirements of these stations will be, but we think that the value of such items as have to ne put into the stations will be between £ 20 G and £250 per station within the next twelve to eighteen months. The appar atus will probably be mostly in tlie nature of valves, batteries and small replacement parts. I am Sir Yours truly, Assistant Secretary. The Under-Secretary of State for India INDIA OFFICE, Whitehall, S.W.l.Clause 5 of the Memorandum of conditions regarding the closing down of the I.E.T.D. provides that 'from the date of transfer of the Gulf Cable and assets to Imperial Inter national Communications Ltd. the Company will undertake to maintain cable and wireless communication in the Gulf'. V There are three BritichWireless Stations in Persian Territory, viz., Lingah, Henjam and Bushire. That at Lingah was closed down last year and placed in charge of a custodian. The other two are still functioning, and responsibility for their maintenance rests with I. and I.C. V It is proposed ns pnrt of a satisfactory Treaty settlement with Persia eventually to transfer the apparatus at Lingah and the Bushire Station to the Persian Government, and to retain the Hen$am Station up to 1945 (or possibly longer) as the tenants of Persia. Unfortunately the prospect of an early agree ment with Persia on these lines is far from hopeful. 4 *. ITo formal license has ever been granted, by the Persian Government for the working of these Stations. They have, however, been in operation for many years with the full knowledge of the Persian Government. p, In 1927 the Persian Government prohibited the importation of wireless sets into Persia, and His Majesty 1 s Minister at Tehran reported that this prohibition applied to installations and accessories for the I.E.T.L. Wireless Station..■MMMSBBMMMWWiaMl &lt;m Minute Paper. Department. However, 'before th.e proh.i'bition took effect the Department were able to overhaul and renew their apparatus, and in 1928 it was anticipated that the Stations would be able to carry on for about a year without further replenishments. (o, Apparently in practice it has been found possible to keep them going up to the present time with I.E.T.D. stores without involving raising the issue with the Persian Authorities, but as between ourselves and the I.&amp;.I. C. the question has now come to a head in consequence of an enquiry from the latter in July last whether,in the event of their having to supply wireless material and apparatus for either the Bushire or Henjam Stat ions,arrangements would be made for such imports to be admitted into Persia and to be exempt from duties. 7 , The recently concluded Agreement with Persia in regard to the maintenance of cable communications in the Gulf provides for the free import of stores required for the Cable Stations, but it contains no such provision as regards wireless stores, before, therefore, any reply be sent to the Company* s enquiry it was considered desirable to consult His Majesty*s Minister at Tehran as to the present position and the possibility of the Persians proving a.ccommodat ing. In making this enquiry the Foreign Office suggested to Mr. Ho are that it might be possible to import wireless stores without difficulty under the general heading of technical material needed by the Company.&gt;1 If, as was thought probable, he felt that such a course was, on general grounds, undesirable, he was invited to say whether he considered it likel that the Persian Government, if approached on the subject, would either prohibit importation altogethe or permit it subject to payment of Custons dues. i 0 , Mr. Hoare} repl^.^4flagged n A M . He anticipates that it would probably be quite easy to import wireless stores with cable material, but since to do so would deprive the Persian Government of revenue,-as in this way the wireless stores would escape duty,—to which they were undoubtedly entitled^ since its waiver was not provided for in any agreement, written or unwritten' such p course could not be advised. On the other hand he gives very good reasons why we should refrain from addressing any enquiry i*Y*X*X. on the subject to the Persian Government in wi&gt;ioh His Majesty 1 s Government had decided their course of action in the event of a demand from Persia for the » surrender of the Stations, and finally he remarked that he saw no objection to the^export as cable material of any small quantities of wireless material that might be needed to keep the Stations in proper repair, pending further consideration i N.P- ix. of the political question.! It will be seen from the subsequent exchange of views between this Department the Political Department and the Poreign Office that it is very difficult to frame a suitable reply to the Company* s enquiry.'? r Obviousl^we^cannot encourage them to cheat the Persian Government or camouflage their imports of wireless material on a wholesale scale. On the other/ (Minute Paper. Department.. other hand we can hold out no iiranediate prospect of while we insist on the Stations being maintained, and the only way this can be done is for small quantities of wireless malterLal to be imported ps cable stores. The difficulty is to mention this possibility without Pctively encouraging it. The Foreign Office have suggested a forr-alA which seems to meet this difficulty rs well as it is possible to do so. It is therefore proposed to adopt the Foreign Office draft and to reply to the Company in accordance therewith.and customs dues, on the ground that the material is needed for the upkeep of stations which are destined under certain conditions eventually to become the property of the Persian Government themselves, and which they will naturally wish to receive in a satis factory state of repair. The Persian Government, however, have not as yet • • been approached on these lines, and there may still prove to be objections to such a communication being made to them at the present stage, 4. As a purely provisional measure, and pending a decision in regard to the communication to be made to the Persian Government on the subject, the Company may be able to import with its cable material such small quantities of wireless material as may from time to time be essential to keep the stations in good repair. The Company will, however, realise the importance of avoiding any dispute with the local Persian customs authorities on this question.I am sorry that owin^ to pressure of more urgent work disposal of this reference has been delayed. 2. I agree generally that in the circumstances the alternative draft proposed hy the Foreign Office is preferable to that originally suggested hy us in the light of the Minister at Tehran's observations. The situation is admittedly unsatisfactory, but it is difficult to see how better to deal with it. 3. As regards paragraph 2 of note, the position is that under their agreement with us the Communications Company are required to maintain wireless and cable communication in the Gulf and so to maintain the wireless stations at Hen jam, Lingah (at present closed) ana Busnire. It is proposed, as part of a satisfactory Treaty settlement, to transfer y the apparatus, etc. of tnese stations to the Persians in return inter alia for a re-lease by them for a penoa to be fixed of the station at Bfebjam. if and when/when the negotiations reach®! a satisfactory conclusion the Communications Company woula therefore he relieved of responsibility in respect of Bushire and Lingah. Unfortunately, there seems no immediate prospect of a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations and in the meantime it is of great importance from the point of view of communications in the Gulf that the wireless stations both at Bushire and Hen Jem should be kept in efficient working order, 4. If the worst comes to the worst the Company will, I fear, have to pay duty on any wireless material they may import.in 0 . is to be invited to authorise a letter to the Oompany inviting then to dodge the Persian Oustoms regulalons, he will presumably require a rather full note, detailing among other things tfte relevant provisions of the agreements affecting the case and explaining exactly how important it is to keep the wireless stations at Bushire and Henjam working. Such a note can best, I think, be prepared in the Political Department, and night perhaps be submitted by £ou, though I should have no objection to having it put forward in the E. and 0. Delfrtnent if you think this desirable.■ 'A. (S V- * f] tv , 2 (E 5345/64/34).

It is difficult to know exactly what should be said to the Company on this point. I should be inclined myself to avoid suggesting to them that it is in their own interests that we are refraining from raising the whole question with the Persian Government at this stage, as they will then feel aggrieved if we do eventually decide to raise the question and the Persians insist on their paying customs dues. Moreover, I do not much like suggesting to the Company in an official letter that they should smuggle into Persia such wireless material/ A.Dibdin, Esq.,material as they may require, disguised as cable material which they are allowed to import under the Convention free of duty. In spite of what Hoare says, in paragraph 6 of his despatch No. 385, I feel that it is really going rather far to encourage them to break the Persian laws and regulations, which may easily get them into trouble. 3. It is very difficult, however, to suggest any entirely satisfactory alternative. I enclose a rough draft which might perhaps do, but please do not hesitate to let us know if you see any objection, or if any obviously preferable alternative occurs to you.October# 1932&lt; Draft.

Although the Telegraphs Agreement signed on February 13th makes no mention of the wireless stations, there is no doubt that they are, for as long ss the company operates them, integral parts of the system of communication maintained by the company, with the approral of the Persian Government on Persian soil* Accordingly, if it were only s question of securing permission to import the material tinder the Trade Monopoly Lav or similar kegle- Ivtion, I should have little hesitation in recommending that it should be imported as cable material. 3. The question is unfortunately eomplleated by the fast that the material imported by the company for the use of the cable stations is imported free of duty under the terms of the Telegraphs Agreement, which will presumably soon be in force. Any wireless material would consequently have to be imported free of duty sleo, if the difference between it and sable material were not to be disclosed, and would thus u f 'be company to benefit financially at the expense of the Persian Gove nment in a matter not provided for in any agreement, written or un-ritten. Although I consider that morally the company are fully entitled to this benefit, seeing that the material Is needsd to keep The Might Honourable ^ Sir John Simon G.C.S.I., etc*, etc., etc., The Foreign Office*I 6948 I - 2 . in good repair two stations which sre expected tm ultie^tely to beeoee the property of the Per si an Oorernaent theaselreet it would unquestionably be sore ingenuous to place these considerations before that GoYemaent and secure their approwal beforehand* 4» If the Persian Government were invited to «dlow the import of material for the wireless stations free of Trade Monopoly Lew restrictions and customs dues, on the ground that the m'tte'lal was needed for the upkeep of stations which they would naturally wish to receive in due course in good repair, I do not think that they would refuse to allow it to be imported at all or (though 1 am less I confident on this point) insist on the payment of customs dues. They would almost certainly, however, ask that the stations should be handed over to them without more delay and if this were refused it is not impossible that they might take steps to prevent their furthei use. This question cannot be considered apart from the general pelltleal situation, which has now developed to the point where the negotiations are practically suspended and s request for the removal of the naval depot fron Hen jam nay cone at any tine (see my despatch No. 582 of 10th September), 6* I accordingly recommend that X should not address any enquiry to the Per si mi Government on this subject until His Majesty # 8 Govei sent have decided upon the course of astlon they will adopt in the event of a demand for the surrender of the atationa, treaty or no treaty, being receivedt and of more astlve atepa being taken by the Persian Government In support of this demand. 6. Notwithstanding anything that I have written above, I see no objection to the import aa sable material of any small quantities of wireless naterlsl that nay be needed to keep the atationa in properV fiS'tS *. v - o proper repair while this question is being considered* 7# I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign 1 ecretary to the Gorernreent of India (he. 182) and to the Honourable the Political Hesiaent in the Persian Gulf at Buehire (No. 147).

I enclose a copy of a despatch on this subject which we sent to Tehran on August 25th. The Tehran Legation did not send home copies of the correspondence relating to the troubles wnich arose in May 1930 in connexion with the importation of wireless material for Henjam, but you will find a brief reference to these difficulties in paragraph 113 (page 31) of the Persian Annual Report for 1930.

You will recall th*&gt;t difficulties aro&amp;e in this connexion not only in 1927, as the Tn ia Office letter obeerwes 9 but aloo as recently as May 1930 9 when the Persian Government were already aware that by the terms of an agreed article in the proposed gen ral treaty they would eventually obtain poesesalon of the wireless stations in question. It may be that the subsequent withdrawal of the Indo~^urop*an Telegraph Department, whose presence on Persian aoll thuy resented, has altered the position ana caused them to take a caore reasonable view regarding the maintenance of the wircleus stations at Bushlre and Eon jam. It also ap cars poe ible that the wlreleaa mate ial required at these stations, which presumably consists for the most part of electrical accessories not easily identifiable except to the expert, might be imported without difficulty under the gemral heading of technical material needed R • H.

Our letter of 23rd February 1931 to which they r efer warned them that they would be required under the terms of their agreement with us to maintain wireless communication in the Gulf and so to maintain the Bushire and Hen jam stations so long as Persia allowed us tos retain these stations. We also told them confidentially that we were conducting negotiations with Persia on the subject of the wireless stations, and that if these negotiations were auccess^ul the Bushire station would be closed down and that we should retain the Henjam station as tenants of Persia, probably for a period of 26 years. / I enclose a copy of our reply to the Company, whic is I think self-explanatory. We shall be very grateful if you can let us know (if necessary after consultation with Hoare) whether any difficulty may be anticipated in connection with the importation of wireless instruments and accessories into Persia for the purpose of keeping the stations going, and, secondly, whether any difficulty is likely to arise over the payment of customs duty in respect of such instruments or material. You will remember that there was considerable correspondence in 1927 as the result of Persian prohibition of importation. As regards customs duties, the recently signed agreement with the I.E.T.D. contains no reference to wireless stores, and the importation of such stores is not covered by D.W. Lascelles Esq., any/ Foreign Office, S. W. 1.■■■ any explicit or implicit agreement. We hope, however, that whatever difficulties there maybe over the payment of customs duties, it will be possible to overcome Persian objections to the importation of the necessary material for the maintenance of the stations, since in the event of a general agreement being reached, the wireless installations at both Bushire and Henjam will become her property and it is to her interest that 1 they should therefore be maintained in as efficient a working condition as possible. Yours, Ac., &amp;). ) A. DIED IN.CER/M. IMPERIAL &amp; INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED, ELECTRA HOUSE, MOORGATE, LONDON, E. C. 2. 28th July 1932. Sir, I Deg to refer to your letter E.&amp; 0.1183/31, of the * 23rd February 1931, and in particular to the subject of the wireless stations at Bushire and Henjam. As we have received no further information regarding these stations the Company has not up to the present renewed or replaced any of the wireless apparatus there but the time has now arrived when certain renewals should be made before further deterioration of the existing apparatus affects the efficiency of the stations. The Company naturally does not wish to incur expense in the provision of new apparatus for a station which may shortly pass from its control and I shall be obliged, therefore, if the Secretary of State could now give any more definite information as to the future of the wireless stations at Bushire and Henjam. Further, it maybe mentioned that although the Persian Telegraph Agreement dated 17th February 1932 contains no reference to wireless stations, it is assumed that in the event of the Company having to supply wireless material and apparatus for either place arrangements would be made for such imports to be admitted into Persia and to be exempt fro* customs duties.
