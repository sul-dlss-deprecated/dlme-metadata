If the passenger's papers will not be in order by the date shown at overleaf, the Air Ministry Middle East Representative should be informed. 2) Passengers are required to report to the Air Boohing Centre for weighing in before noon on the day before departure. Weighing in may however be done as soon as this authorisation is received provided the passenger reports to the Centre 24 hours before he expects to depart to be given details of his travel arrangements. 3) The baggage weight permitted for each adult passenger is 44 lbs on B.O.A.C, 65 lbs. on R.A.F. U.S.A.T.C. aircraft and 33 lbs. on MISR Airworh. Passengers on B.O.A.C. aircraft may carry up to 65 lbs but the difference between 44 and 65 lbs is charged as excess baggage and must be paid for as such. The total weight of baggage which may be carried is shown at “H' overleaf. 4) The Air Priorities Board affords each passenger priority appropriate to the information ^avai lable concerning the urgency of his journey and its contribution to the war effort.
