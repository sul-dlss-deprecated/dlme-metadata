Zhali. Turkish Aggression. ^ °. f Z A a ! i A the Shaikhs and • as one of tJie stipendiaries of Government,—one of the me tribes,—has never ceased to urge Government to assist in obtaining Phe Governor General of Yemen recently informed the Resident that i • L • tilG vllla o es around were part of the province of Kattaba, which is recognized Turkish territory, and that Ali Mokhbil was only elected Ameer of Kharaffa and its surrounding villages; but there is no doubt that Ah Mokhbil was an independent Chief at Zhali before the appearance of Turkish troops at Kattaba in 1873. ^ ithin the past two years the Mootasurif of Taiz sought an interview with Ali Mokhbil at a village near Zhali, and he would then have been reappointed Ameer, as formerly, had he consented to make Ms submis sion to the Porte. He has persistently refused to do so, remembering the treatment he received at Taiz. On the assassination of Mahomed Masaad,—in 1874, I think,—his son Abdalla was appointed Madeer (Superintendent) of Zhali. Major Good- fellow reports that the latter has gone into rebellion and has fled from Zhali, probably finding his position intolerable. It is said one Ahmed Mathama has succeeded Abdalla bin Mahomed Masaad. Ali Mokhbil has always declared that he could easily regain the whole of his country and his position as Ameer if all Turkish troops and zaptyas (irregulars) were withdrawn from Zhali, and if the Turks ceased to interfere with the district. Her Majesty’s Government have fre quently pressed the Porte on the above points, and regular troops were removed from Zhali. A few irregulars have, however, always remained there, as well as Turkish officials, to give countenance to 'the Madeer appointed by them. The question has become a difficult one to deal with, for the following reasons:— 1. The Governor General claims Zhali and its subordinate villages as part of the province of Kattaba, and taxes are levied from the people and paid to Turkish officials. 2. The Turks have exercised jurisdiction over Zhaii for more than three years, notwithstanding the repeated representations that have been made to the Foreign Office on the subject. 18147 .3 - privately assure him that they are ready to renew then allegianc to him whenever opportunity offers. T ( lo not sunnose it can he the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to dfZrelTn continue to press the Ottoman Porte to re_ the condition of things around Aden as they stood m 1872, ftc/me t nndertook the reconqnest of Yemen, and the present time is flvonrlble for a further effort in this behalf. There is not a shadow of doubt that All Mokhbil was displaced simply because he refused to acknowledge the Porte, he being then the stipendiary of Government, •md he was advised by the Resident to say so when pressed by the Turks All other Chiefs were told to the same effect, when they asked what course they should adopt when Turkish Officers called on them to make tlieir submission. , r . , , There is danger in allowing the matter to slide, and Her Majesty s Government is hound to do all it can to obtain the restoration of All Mokhbil to the position he held in 1872. He has suffered from leaning on the British. Government instead of submitting to the rorte. It ^ Ail Mokhbil disappears from Kharaffa, it is probable a Turkish nominee will succeed him. Turkish influence will then be felt in the next dis trict viz., that of the Alowee Shaikh, and it will he extended to the Soobhahees and the Howshebhee Sultan. The Sultans of Lahej and the Poodhli Chief would then he disturbed. If the Ottoman Porte will give orders to the Governor General ot Yemen to withdraw all its oflicials from Zhali, and reeogmze the position of 1872, I have no doubt Ali Mokhhil will at once become Ameer. I confess, however, that I have little expectations that the Porte will give up the Zhali district, which has been annexed to Kattaha, except under extreme pressure. J. W.
