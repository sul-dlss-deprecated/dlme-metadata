In case neither of the High Contracting Parties should have given notice to the other six months before the expiration of the said period of seven years of his intention to terminate the Treaty, it was to remain in force until the expiration of six months from the date on which either of the parties should have given notice of termina tion to the other party. By an exchange of Notes of 3rd October, 1936, corresponding with the 17th Rajab, 1355, it was provided that the two Governments “ have reciprocally agreed to abolish for a period of seven solar years from to-day’s date their right to give six months’ notice of their wish to terminate the said Treaty as provided for in Article 8 thereof.” The period of seven years aforesaid terminates on 3rd October, 1943, corresponding with the 4th Shawwal, 1362, but both Governments desire to place their relations on a more stable basis. Consequently the Saudi Arabian Govern ment propose that as from the 4th Shawwal, 1362, corresponding with 3rd October, 1943, the period during which the Treaty of Jedda shall be binding shall be as follows: — The Treaty of Jedda concluded on 18th Zul Qa’da, 1345, corresponding with 20th May, 1927, between His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia (the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies) and His Majesty The King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, shall as from the 4th Shawwal, 1362, corresponding with 3rd October, 1943, be automatically prolonged for successive periods of seven solar years unless either of the two High Contracting Parties shall have given notice to the other six months before the expiration of any of the said periods of seven solar years of his intention to modify or terminate the Treaty. This Note, together with your Excellency’s reply confirming that the Government of the United Kingdom accept this proposal, shall constitute a mutually binding agreement between our two Governments which shall come into force from to-day’s date. Please accept, &amp;c. YUSUF YASIN, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. (9 “ Treaty Series No. 25 (1927).” Cmd. 2951. (a) “ Treaty Series No. 10 (1937),” Cmd. 5380.) ■ ■ No. 2 Mr. 8. R.

During my stay in Riyadh I saw a great deal of the Amir Saud and the impression he made upon me was not unfavourable though he shows little signs of being the strong man that his father is. He is inclined to modem tendencies and in this respect may fall foul of the religious heads of the country since the strength of the present regime lies, other than on the strength of Xbn Saud, in the strong religious principles held by the Wahhabis who are opposed to innovation and rely entirely on Koranic teachings for the regulation of their day to day life. Another aspect of the present regime which I view unfavourably in the extravagance by which it is characterised. Riyadh is fast becoming a city /of The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.,M.P., &amp;C. , Ac., &amp;C. , GipW-J tf.-/$oyOL eip C, O- » Foreign Office. '«3 3 «.of palaces for the King and the many princelings. At Kharj a small agricultural settlement some distance from Riyadh the main feature of the landscape is the . three interconnected palaces. These are large and spacious and the floors are covered with costly carpets. It is doubtful whether Ibn Saud ever visits the place and if so only at long intervals. When in Taif on my way back to Jeddah I noticed a large area of ground covered with granite blocks and enquired whether they were for road building. I was informed that they were for the construction of a large palace for the Amir Peisal. These extravagances when the country is largely supported by subsidies make me fear for the eventual continuation of the Ibn Saud dynasty. Unless there are some radical changes the Amir Saud will, as far as I can see inherit with the throne a series of debts and overdrafts and have little with which to meet them. A point of his favour however is the interest which the United States of American are showing in the country owing to the exploitation of their oil concessions in the Dhahran area. The readiness with which the oil company makes advances to Ibn Saud is symptomatic and my first impressions would lead me to believe that the United States Government would favour a continuation of the Ibn Saud dynasty rather than have politics upheavals which could only lead to trouble an expense for the United States company exploiting these fields. I am sending copies of this despatch and i os enclosure to the Minister of State. I have, etc., (Signed).- S.R. JORDAN.copy Riyadh - 20.9.43 The Amir Saud asked me to go and see him privaterly this morning. He had previously sent me a message, through Abd us Salam G-hali, the 'Director of Government Hospitality”, to say that he was thoroughly pro-democratic and pro-ally in his principles and supported up to the hilt the policy of his father. Saud receive!me in the little semi-subterranean chamber leading off his flower garden at Badia. He, Abd us Salam and myself were the only persons present. After a little small talk he referred to the message he had sent through Abd us Salam and said he had wanted to speak to me last year (December 1942) when hewaa in Jedda with the King but there had not been a suitable opportunity for a private talk. He stressed the private and personal nature of this present talk and asked me not to let any of the 'Nashia” i.e. the Court, know that it had taken place, because there were some of them who did not see eye to eye with him and his father and it was undesirable to give them a subject for gossip and speculation. His Royal Highness did not say specifically who these people were, but said: ”We don’t care about their differing in ’’opinion from us, because we have a strong control of the ' 'situation and we can impose on this country the policy ”we hold to be the right one.” His Royal Highness said the King had yielded the direction of the country’s affairs to him, retaining only Foreign Policy in his own hands. Tribal and financial matters etc, were all thrown on Baud’s shoulders now, and there would come a time when he would be responsible for foreign affairs also. He wanted to emphasize that he was in the fullest agreement with his father’s policy: that he considered the British connection to be fundamental and essential to his country’s welfare. Just as Ibn Saud, in the worst times for the Allies - when the Germans were at SI Alamein, for example - had declared firmly that whatever happened he would be loyal to his friends the British, so he, Saud, based himself on the principle of loyalty, in the first place because loyalty to one’s friends and allies was fundamental in Islam and Arabism, and secondly, because the welfare of the country demanded it. Saud referred to conversations he h^d had with Naji Shawkat and Jamal 1 Husseini, both of whom had tried to persuade Ibn Saud to abandon the British connection. Saud had replied to them himself and argued for unswerving loyalty to Great Britain. His father had highly approved his answers. Saud said he had met Mr. Eden, Lord Halifax and Mr. Macdonald in London and had given them his views. Now, when one must think about the future, although, please God, Ibn Saud had many years before him, he wanted His Majesty’s Government to be assured directly from himself that he would not only carry out his father’s policy but better it. /The/ &gt; The country, he said, was undeniably backward was ^ lvin ^ tnuch thci^ht to the improvements that were* necessary.

' ... \ I was met at the aerodrome in the early afternoon ' of December 27th with an invitation to call at the Palade at 4.30. This, first.interview was followed by two.further talks m the morning and afternoon of December 28th, and my Visit ended with a banquet that evening. Altogether we talked for about .6 hours out of the 30 and I owed much to the fluent Arabic of Mr. Wall who acted as interpreter. . Saud ■ s friendliness was almost embarrassing. It is.contrary to Arab hospitality for the host‘to. signify that an interview is ended but he so often reseated that all his time v/as entirely mine that it was always 'difficult to take my leave. In this outline of our discussions I will not repeat what has already been covered by His Majesty's Minister in Jedda m his despatch No. 51 of December 13th 1942. - ‘ '■'■ We examined problems of supply and arranged for the representative of the Middle East Supply Centre who had a 2 c °?P an i e ^ me.to Jedda to,discuss matters with the Minister ox Finance. We.discussed the prospect of greater productivity as a result of the survey by American experts of agricultural possibilities. Ibn Saud said that boring had proved the existence ol water East and North East of Riadh but generally at great depth necessitating pumping machinery which could not^now be procured. It vail not be easy to apply expert advice. Wen I suggested veterinaiy research might help to deal with the ravages of disease among camels, he said it would be impossible to induce wandering tribes to take advantage of scientific advice. / We2m We passed on to the economic reconst inaction of the Arab States, Ibn Baud agreed that closer economic relations between Arab States would be necessary but said that conditions must be clearly established to guarantee that advantages are reciprocal and this could only be achieved by His Majesty’s Government acting as referee. Although he admitted a case for freer trade, he did not support the idea of Arab political unitv. He said that it would be no use for a State to exchange British influence for the domination of Iraq or Egypt. Each Arab State should achieve its own independence and at the same time bind itself to His Majesty s Government both fof protection against the non-Arab world and for the solution of difficulties that might arise between the Arab States. The claims of those who championed Arab independence were not always inspired by love of fellow Arabs so much as by their own territorial ambitions. Bid the Iraqis wish His Majesty s Government to clear out of Palestine merely in order to take it for themselves? Iraq had .recently requested Ibn Saud to make a. joint approach to His Majesty’s Government about the rumoured formation of an independent Jewish Aimy in Palestine. He had heard from broadcasts that the Palestinian Regiment was to be part^ of the British Aimy and had replied accordingly, stressing that a formal and public approach to His Majesty s Government at the present time would only cause embarrassment and be interpreted by'the Axis as an indication a quarrel between His Majesty’s Government and the Arabs. In nis own v/ords; n If I were to protest about this Jewish Aimy story, I should be doing Fifth Column work among the Arabs% •Ibn Saud realises that his people are being &gt; saved from starvation and want through the agency of_His Majesty’s Government. Our conversations convinced me of the depth of his conviction that the future 01 his o n dynasty in particular and of the Arab States m general must be dependent on the maintenance and increase ox British influence. [Copies sent to Mr. Aimstrong].i have the honour to transmit to ^ou herewith an account drawn up Mr. Wall of the five interviews which King Abdul Aziz granted me during his p r stay in Jedda. 2. 1 have asked Mr. Wall to reproduce as closely as possible the King’s n own words, as in this way a far clearer picture can be formed of the spirit and J/ the wisdom of this truly great man. ‘ 3. King Abdul Aziz Ibn Baud’s present most friendly attitude is due in large measure to his genuine appreciation of the generous and helpful attitude of His Majesty’s Government in these most difficult times. Owing to the serious drop in his two sources of revenue, pilgrimage and oil, he has found himself with a revenue of approximately 10 per cent, of his expenditure. Export restrictions imposed by all countries surrounding him and the scarcity of shipping space has rendered the supplying of his country with sufficient food, motor transport and other necessities a most difficult question. His Majesty has genuinely appreciated the efforts which have been made to solve this problem, more vital to this than to surrounding countries, as Saudi Arabia, which grows practically no food and has no industries, is dependent on imports for its existence. 4. The King’s policy is based on the firm conviction that the interests of the Arab world lie in the victory of the Allied nations and in a continuation of, I and, indeed, an increase in, British influence in the Near East. As will be seen from the accompanying record, His Majesty does not believe in a union of existing Arab States, each of whom, he says, has its own characteristics. What he hopes for is, that all Arab States, whilst remaining independent of one another, will be united by the common bond of friendship and closest co-operation with the British. Times have changed and weak States cannot stand alone, and unless the Arab States look to Britain for protection against external aggression and to act as intermediary in their disputes one with another they will inevitably fall under some foreign domination. 5. The King’s statement, that we do not need to do any propaganda as he himself is our best and most effective propagandist, is literally true. The King has consistently, from the outbreak of war, backed the Allies to win, grieved over their set-backs and rejoiced in their successes. Three examples will serve to illustrate his attitude. When France fell, he sent me a personal message expressing grief at the difficulties which the British would now have to face but assuring me of his full confidence in a final British victory. When H.M.S. Hood was lost and certain of his counsellors suggested that even on sea the British were being beaten, he bade them have patience for a few days, and when the Bismarck was sunk these same counsellors were made to stand up and clap. His religious advisers, the Ulema of Nejd, criticised him for his distress over General Rommel’s advance into Egypt, saying, that he, a Moslem, was endangering his health and reducing himself to a mental state, which was causing him to neglect his duty, over a quarrel between unbelievers. His Majesty berated his critics most soundly, pointing out at the end of his lecture on the reasons for his policy, that his friends, the British, were certainly Christians and not Moslems but that, were it not for their generosity and help and their success in keeping Rommel out of Egypt, they, the Ulema, would have no food in their bellies and no clothes on their backs. 6. Ibn Saud’s views on the present position of Germany are interesting and picturesque. He likeris Hitler to a man who has stuffed himself with much and varied food (the countries of Europe) in the belief that he will derive great strength from his meals. But he has swallowed, not nourishing food, but a number of vipers and scorpions, and whilst these tear at his vitak Britain, America and Russia, attack him. [37—29] C-0 (0 -S y7. In one of our interviews, at which the resident Middle East Supply Centre representative and the recently appointed British transport adviser attended, Ibn Sand showed great understanding of the difficulties which faced His Majesty's Government in their endeavour to keep Saudi Arabia supplied with even their minimum requirements in food and especially transport. His Majesty felt, however, that he must stress the vital necessity for keeping his transport system in proper working order as on it depended not only the feeding of the population in outlying districts but the maintenance of public security throughout his vas|ph* territory. 8. I cannot close this, my last report from Jedda, without acknowledging my debt to Mr. Wall whose knowledge of the language and .sympathetic insight have contributed, so greatly to the atmosphere of friendship and perfect under standing which has always obtained at my interviews with King Abdul Aziz. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch with its enclosure to His Majesty’s Minister of State, Cairo, the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, His Majesty’s Ambassador, Cairo, His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad, the High Commissioner for Palestine, the Governor of Aden, His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, His Majesty’s Minister, Beirut, and the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have, &amp;c. E. H. W. STONEHEWER-BIRD. Enclosure. Memorandum of Conversations between His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud and His Majesty's Minister at Jedda, December 6-10, 1942. HIS Majesty, contrary to his usual practice, came to Jedda before the pilgrimage this year. He arrived early in the morning of the 5th December, and received the members of the Diplomatic Corps the same morning, each mission being received separately, as has been done since the outbreak of war. His Majesty’s Minister accompanied by his staff was received at 10-45 a.m. The conversation was confined entirely to formal compliments and lasted ten minutes. His Majesty was suffering from a slight cold which had given? him a sore throat and made his voice somewhat husky. , A private interview was arranged for His Majesty’s Minister at the King s request every morning while he was in Jedda. “ Even though there may be no business to discuss,” said the King, “ I love talking. On one occasion, when His Majesty’s Minister had expressed a fear that he had taken up a good deal of His Majesty’s time, the King replied : “ We have no business except with you, we came to Jedda this time just to talk to you. His Majesty’s Minister w T as accompanied by Mr. Wall as interpreter, oheikh Yusuf Yasin was present at all the interviews, and the Amir Feisal at most of them. One interview at which questions of supply were discussed was attended by Hamad-al-Suleiman, Deputy Minister of Finance, and Najib Salha, of the Ministry of Finance, who has been specially appointed to deal with supply matters. Lieutenant-Colonel Griffin, resident representative of the Middle East Supply Centre, and Major Shoosmith, the transport adviser, were also present at this meeting. The Amir Mansur, Ibn Saud s seventh son (by his favouiite wife, Umm Tallal, whom he had brought to Jedda with some of her smaller children), was present at one interview. Sir John Dashwood attended one interview. The interviews took place in the main reception room of the palace : a vast and windy hall with the furniture so arranged that it is almost impossible to hear anything spoken except by the person on your immediate left or right. The King sat in the middle chair of a row placed across one end of the room, with His Majesty’s Minister on his right and the Amir Feisal, Yusuf Yasin and the others a good way down one side of the room, just within, or peihaps just out of, hearing. When it was necessary for any of them to join in the conversation they could only do so by coming forward 1 and squatting on the carpet in front of the King. (There was no loss of dignity in this, for the King and his people have carried the manners of the tent into their palaces.) Before conversation began the crowd of armed and richly garbed bodyguard was waved away through various doors and windows by a slight gesture of the King’s hand.3 Ibn Saud talks fast and says a great deal. He has a strong Nejdi accent, but in talking politics to foreigners he uses a fairly pure vocabulary, only lapsing into phrases of dialect when he warms to his subject. He has little tricks of speech—the Arabic equivalents of “ listen! ” and “ don’t you see? ”—with which he sprinkles every sentence. He gives to some ordinary Arabic words a peculiar and personal meaning : for example, “ A1 Hukoomah ”—the Government—means in his speech, the Government, i.e., the British; and once a long and heated •misunderstanding was only cleared up when it was found that the word ^ Meezaniyah,’ by which everyone else understood “ budget,” meant to him any kind of inventory or list. He knows no foreign language, and his pronunciation of foreign names is no more than approximate. His mind is richly stored with fables, proverbs and tales of Arab history, with which, and, of course, verses of the Koran, he illustrates his points. His Majesty’s Minister first of all told the King that he had been transferred on temporary duty to Morocco. “ This is sad and unexpected news,’’ Ibn Saud said. “ I don’t want to lose you. Let me telegraph to the Government and ask them to let you stay.” His Majesty’s Minister explained the reasons that had led His Majesty’s Government to their decision. “ I know,” was the reply, “ that they are only transferring you because of your experience over there, but we benefit as much from your being here as the Government hope to do from your being in Morocco. In all these difficult times it has been a great comfort to me to know that you were here in Jedda working day and night for us; it has been as if the Government itself were sitting here in our country.” His Majesty’s Minister assured him that His Majesty’s Government had given every consideration to His Majesty’s interests in taking their decision, and that the old policy of firm friendship would 1 not be changed. He left behind him a staff who had followed all developments with him. “ True,” said the King. “ But our happy company will not he complete without you. You are one of us, and it’s in the interests of the Government as well as our own that you should be here binding us together in our friendship.” (He made the Arab gesture of linking his two forefingers.) “ I am glad you’re going to London; that will be good for us. But when you leave London I want you to come back here.” His Majesty’s Minister asked if there were any particular matters or points of view which His Majesty might wish him to raise in London. “ You know everything we have to tell the Government as well as we do,” said the King. “ There is nothing that matters to this country and its sons that you have not as much at heart as they have.” The King reverted at every interview to the subject of His Majesty’s Minister’s departure. One morning he had called in his little sons, Nawwaf and Tallal, and one of his Idaughters, Mudhawi, a child of 2. He took the little girl on his knees, and as His Majesty’s Minister took her hand, said to her : “ Qooli me tarooh, abadan ma tarooh ”—“ Tell him not to go, not to go at all.’ J He spoke also, with a freedom from reserve noteworthy even in the familiar atmosphere that is usual in his interviews with His Majesty’s Minister, of his “ family’s ” regret at the parting, “ family ” here meaning Umm Tallal, who had entertained His Majesty’s Minister’s wife and daughter at Riyadh earlier in the year, and who received them again in Jedda during this visit of the King. His Majesty’s Minister referred to the two major problems with which he had been concerned : finance and supplies, together with the related question of motor transport. He repeated what he had said in many previous talksthat His Majesty’s Government would give all the help they could, and that if supplies were not always forthcoming just when needed, the reason was not an unwilling ness to help on anyone’s part, but the fact that neither the supplies nor the ships to carry them could be found always when they were wanted The King replied : “I understand that perfectly. No one knows better than I how generously the Government have responded to our appeals. I am deeply grateful and wish to say so on all occasions. I know, too, that military needs must come before all others. If you carry rice to this country, perhaps you have to leave behind a tank that ought to be sent to Africa. That’s the main thing— to beat the Axis. That’s in our interest, as I’m always saying. But you know my habit: I like to tell the Government just how we are placed here in this country; to tell them everything and leave it to them, who know the general situation better than I, to do what they think is best for them and for us. [37—29] b 25 dealing and honourable treatment we have always had from them. There are two kinds of relationships between countries : the relationship of fear—fear of the subjected for the conqueror—and the relationship based on mutual interest and co-operation. That is the relationship between you and us. Who else would have treated us as you have? We were talking the other day and someone said : If the Axis said to us : Come to us and we will treat you just like the people of Berlin and Rome, and if at the same time the Government said to us : Come to His; we cannot treat you like the people of London, but we will treat you like xhe people of our colonies, which should we choose ? ' I say the latter, of course. It s as clear as the sun. How have those two rogues ‘ Hatler 5 and ‘ Missoluni ’ treated their own people in Berlin and Rome? They have slaughtered them and tortured them most barbarously. But the Government treat the people of their colonies just like the sons of England. Look at India. A land of kings. Do you think anyone else, Arab or foreigner, who might have conquered India would have left those kings to enjoy their rights and privileges ? No; they would have over thrown and despoiled them.” A reference to the decision of Safi-el-Din-el-Senussi not to come on pilgrimage and stay in the Hejaz made the King chuckle : ££ That’s not a decision of the Senussi. It is the mercy of God, who strengthened the British to defeat the Germans at A1 Alamein.” Much time at each interview was spent in discussing the war news and the general situation. Ibn Sand expressed admiration for America’s war effort. ££ President Roosevelt is a man like your Prime Minister, and it is to the world’s good fortune that there are two such men in such close agreement at this time. Nations are valued by their leaders. A thousand Hons led by a fox are nothing; a thousand foxes led by a lion are an army. These leaders are different from that £ Hatler ’; they rule by consent, not by terror, and they have won the admiration and support of their nations because they have never feared to tell the truth. They and their Governments will last because they seek to do right. We believe profoundly that the works of evil cannot endure.” ££ Hitler and Mussolini have chosen a path that can only lead to disaster. Mussolini—but what is Mussolini ? Mr. Churchill spoke a word about him that pleased me : he called him a jackal. They have made grave mistakes. Hitler made two: first when he failed to invade England after the French were defeated. We were sorely grieved and afraid at that time, for we knew there was no army in England to withstand them. But the mercy of God is evident. Hitler erred and you did not neglect his error. Then he erred in attacking Russia; first, because that gave you a breathing space, and, second, because he had not reckoned the Russian resistance rightly. Nor had anyone—it is a wonder of this war. £ ‘Hitler now is like a man who has swallowed all manner of serpents, vipers and scorpions, all alive and furiously biting in his belly, then while he is struggling with this internal attack he is set upon by lions. The serpents and scorpions are those countries, Poland and Czecho—what-d’ye-call-it; the lions are you and Russia and America. What shall he do? Try and overcome the convulsions within him or defend himself from the lions outside? If God will, he will be torn apart both ways. ££ People talk about a second front. I say the British will not open a second front in Europe. Those places, Belgium and Holland, are well guarded. The fighting man looks for an opening. There was a time when I thought you might try and capture or destroy the French fleet in that place in France where it lay, and from there go on to invade France. Then again I often said you ought to take the Maghrib (i.e., French North Africa). Now you’ve done' it. There’s your second front. Once drive the Germans out of there and you have the Axis in the grip of your hand. And we and the Arabs and all Moslems will rejoice on that day.” At an interview at which Sir John Dash wood was present the talk turned on the misstatements and lies of German propaganda. Sir John Dashwood quoted the reference in a recent German broadcast to “ Rommel’s advance westwards.” This delighted the King. ££ What Arab believes the German wireless now? We have heard them sink the same ship three times over. Lies return upon the head of their disseminator. As the Iraqi proverb says, £ Untruth is a mount will take you forth but will not bring you home again.’ ” His Majesty was asked what future he foresaw for the Arab States after the war.6 “ There is neither victory nor defeat save as God wills,” replied the King. “He exalts whom He will and casts down whom He will. But after our submission to that primal truth we believe most firmly that a happy future for the Arabs depends on a British victory and that that victory is sure. It is a vast subject, but I will try and show you briefly the reasoning that has led me to hold this view. ‘ ‘ Men ask : ‘ What do the Arabs think ? What do the Arabs want ? What will the Arabs do? ’ We have to say what the Arabs are, what are theip* qualities. “ The Arabs have two characteristics : their Islam and their ‘ Arabiyah ’ (‘ Arabism ’—their racial and national feeling). But to be an Arab is not enough. There are still too many primitive and ignorant people among the Arabs for them to form themselves into a great united nation. There remains their Islam : that is something capable of being a basis on which to found a nation. That is if it be true Islam uncorrupted by ignorance and innovation. “ States may have one of two foundations : either strict and undeviating religion, the exact fulfilment of God’s law on earth, or a wise Constitution respected and observed by all the people of the State. No Arab country to-day has either of these. ‘ ‘ The history of the Arabs has been a tale of struggling for unity and power. They have been ruled by a series of dynasties who all sought to weld them into one empire and to strengthen their hold over them, from the days of Bani Ummaiya and Abbas down to the Turks. The Turks were the last to rule an Arab Empire. They kept it together and kept the Arabs in subjection to them by three means : unceasing propaganda for the Turkish Khalifate—Sultan Abdul Hamid used to spend 7 million a year on propaganda, and his ‘ du’at ’ (secret political missionaries) were sent to the ends of the realm; flattery and bribery— they pinned a medal on a noble Arab’s chest and dazzled him with it until he could see nothing else; the deliberate keeping of the mass of the Arab people in ignorance and poverty so that they were too brutalised and spiritless to rise against them. Then there came the great war, and the Arabs stirred and rose, filled with the hope of throwing off the Turkish domination. For the first time for many hundreds of years independence again seemed possible. They fell under the rule of Britain and France. You know what I think about British rule—that I sincerely believe that it has been for the worldly good of the Arabs. As for the French rule—you know what I think about the French. But the Arabs had tasted freedom and now they want to feed full on it. “In statesmanship there are two guiding principles: one is service of country, property and person. The statesman in this is a merchant. Whether he is serving his country or his estate or himself he is making bargains, buying cheap and selling dear. That is natural. Self-interest must always be one of the main motives of human action. The other principle is ‘ sharaf ' (honour and integrity). Earthly success is unpredictable. Man’s powers vary in different times and circumstances in inexplicable ways. At one time a man may seek to jump over that low table there and not be able to and be forced to draw back defeated. At another time he may leap over the mountain tops. Among the vicissitudes of fortune and the strange chances of opportunity there is only one sure thing : to be true to one’s own ideals. The man of integrity will retire in defeat unconquered, though fate may seem to have vanquished him yet he will be master of his fate because he has retained unimpaired his will to do right; he will watch I the changes of circumstances and use every opportunity to advance in some measure the ideals he holds. Such a man will wade through dangers and ^undertake enterprises which others, who look only to immediate profit, view with Gear and foreboding, because he knows the end he seeks is good. “ Until the statesmen of the Arab world understand these two principles and act on them there can be no independence for the Arabs. I don’t see many men in Iraq, in Egypt, in Syria who are acting on them. They do not understand their countries' interest—not even their own. Book at Rashid Ali : the course I warned him against might well have led to his country’s ruin. Fet that pass—he cared not for his country’s interest; you would have thought he might have cared for his own. No their chairs of office are dearer to them than their countries “ We have talked about Palestine. I, an Arab, tell you that the Arabs ? created the Palestine problem. Who but the Arabs called their conferences, raised their clamour and preached and prated about Palestine ? And who were these Arabs ? They were three types : The man who sought to make a wordly reputation for himself and win fame in men’s mouths; the adventurer who had no stake either ftin Palestine or in Syria; and the greedy man who sought merely to enrich, himself. , Let the Arabs of each Arab country look to the improvement of their own country first. There is so much they could do still undone. Let them develop their own agriculture and industry, make themselves prosperous and strong and happy. Then let them use their natural ties of blood and kinship to bind them selves more closely one with another. It can be done—though it will take a long &gt;-t«^ie—by treaties, by friendly understanding, by recognition of mutual interests, ^ok at America : at first America was a collection of weak and separate States. But each State strove to improve itself. It developed its own resources and became strong and prosperous, then put out its hand to its brother States and gradually united with them, until to-day America has become the greatest State on earth. So may the Arabs achieve union, if they will be honest and patient, for it will take a long time. ‘ ‘ The world is not, as some Arabs seem to think, an aeroplane or a motor car i to be steered in the particular direction they want by the turn of the wheel. { Worldly chances are incalculable; destiny will not accommodate itself to our j desires. Who knows what the face of the world will be like after this war ? What j new systems will be brought to life, what mighty States become no more than dust ’ blown down the wind? We only know that it will be changed and a return to that state we were in before impossible. How vain were the hopes of those who held their conferences after the Great War seeking to return to the political and financial systems of before that war. “ But of the Arabs in that new world we can now state two things with certainty : First, the two basic principles of national interest and integrity that I have mentioned will still hold good, and it is on those that the Arabs must base the policy with which they face the new conditions. If they neglect those they will achieve nothing. Second, the Arabs, united or not, cannot stand alone. Where are their aeroplanes, their submarines, their destroyers? They must rely on the friendship, help and protection of some Great Power. “ There are Governments besides the Government. Some of the others would gladly oust the Government from its place in the East. These enemies of ours, the Axis—and especially the Germans—are strong, no doubt. Strong enough to have made many Arabs look to them as the champions of Arab freedom and indepen dence. But I tell you that, if Germany came to the Arabs offering them the moon in one hand and the sun in the other, to accept their gifts would bring nothing but ruin and disaster upon the Arabs “ The Arabs have known the British Government for a long time now. The association has undergone many trials. Both sides have had much to complain of. But after it all, one truth emerges ever clearer : our interests are inevitably bound up together. No one but the Government can help and protect the Arabs, and if that help fail us we are lost. The Government is a tree well rooted and we are the leaves on its branches. If that tree is felled, shall we not wither and perish even before its roots ? “ In conclusion, I will mention three things that have written the lesson clearly. Three things in this war; two of them happened, one was averted. “ First, the German occupation of Europe. We have seen what they have done in Holland and Belgium and those places. Can the Arabs imagine that the Germans love them better than they love the people of Belgium ? “ Second, the revolt in Iraq. The leaders of Iraq, ignoring both their loyalty to their word and their own interest, plunged their country into the worst possible dilemma. Had the Germans succeeded in remaining in Iraq but four months Iraq would have been utterly ruined. The British would have treated the Iraqis as traitors and enemies, and the Germans would have had but one object—to attack the British, and would have slaughtered every Iraqi who hindered them. “ Third, the threatened invasion of Egypt. The Arabs saw the key to the Arab world within the grasp of the Axis, and the battle of A1 Alamein showed them that no one stood between them and that disaster but the British Government. “ There is the truth : history has written it as clear as the sun. Our trust is in God and after that in the Government. This war at all times has proved it, and at no time more than when the Government seemed weakest and nearest to defeat. Now you have great Allies, America and Russia, with millions and with men. No one can now doubt that the Allies have overwhelming power and the issue is not now in doubt. But one thing alone brought this mighty alliance into being : one thing alone stirred America to action and convinced her that the cause was not lost. That was when you in your island, with all your Allies broken, stood8 firm against the world. But for that stand I think neither Russia nor America would have been inspired to fight, the arms of freedom would have been every where cast away, and in that general ruin what hope of Arab independence could survive ? , H 1S Majesty’s Minister had a final interview with Ibn Saud at A1 Shumaisi 51 kilom. from Jedda on the road to Mecca, on Sunday, the 13th December.

(2) Such consultation is in accordance with Article 1 (b) of their Treaty of 1936 and if Ibn Saud is npt informed of correctness of Iraqi Government’s attitude he will naturally assume that they are trying to steal a march on him and be correspondingly annoyed.

Repeated to Bagdad telegram No. 156 Government of India No. 2460 Cairo for Minister of State No. 57 Jerusalem No. 150, P P P P'P P. IMMEDIATE, Bagdad telegram .No, 118 [of jehruary 3rd. Proposed declaration of war byTraq and Saudi Arabia], You are now authorised to make necessary arrangements to be received by Ibn Saud, and to approach him regarding his willingness to declare, a state of war against the Axis. I leave it to you to decide whether de Gaury should precede you, as suggested in Minister of State’s telegram Y° u February 5th] or v/hether you shouldtraveT - 'foRiyadh together. 2. I feel strongly that, when suggestion is made to Ibn Saud as regards his possible entry into the war, it should be put to him as one onanating from His Majesty's Government, and not as a proposal advanced by General Nuri, It is true that we have no evidence that Ibn Saud is likely to be willing to declare a state of war and that, in spite of impression received by de Gaury during his past visits to Riyadh, Ibn-Saud may well be found reluctant to abandon his neutrality. However this may be, I feel sure that, in view of the low opinion which Ibn Saud is known to have of General Nuri's judgment, it would be far better to approach Ibn Saud with our own proposals and on our own initiative, rather than merely convey to him General Nuri's ideas. In point of fact, His Majesty's Government were considering proposed approach to Ibn Saud before General Nuri put forward nis proposals to Sir K, Cornwallis. ' 3, You should therefore remind Ibn Saud that during the past few weeks there have been important world developments which have caused many neutral States to reconsider their attitude towards the war. The entry of America into the war marks a new step in the struggle against the forces of evil, and/ • •and the 26-Power Pact is an important measure directed against the Axis Powers, In these circumstances Ibn Saud has no doubt already felt' ' ’ that the time may have come for him to reconsider, his own position, lis Majesty’s Government would' of course greatly welcome a decision by Ibn Saud to declare the existence of a state of war between Saudi Arabia and tne Axis Powers. They feel that such a declaration by His Maiesty, in view of his great intlucnce throughout the Moslem world, would have a most valuable, effect, and His Majesty's Government are sure that Ion Saud s own inclination would be to use his great influence to help our cause in everv “* possible way, J should then explain that we have reason the Iraqi Government are now considering the declaration of a state of war against Germany and Izely Wp + d M 0 £ . thear desire to adhere to the 26-Power Pact/ He think it i-ost desirable that any action which may be decided upon by Ibn Saud and by the Iraqi Government should be properly co-ordinated, and in our ary eventual declarations by Saudi Arabia and Irah---- should be made simultaneously, do not want Iraq to act first and Saudi Arabia to follow. x + -,?* regards the Iraqi Government's desire / ?4'h ere to the 26-Power Pact, you could explain the position^on lines of paragraph 4 of mv telearrm Hn.

J e Ply on general lines to Ibn Saud’s enquiry would be to following effect. Declaration of war by fP n Sf-ud against Germany and Italy would mean of course' that Ibn Saud would become our Ally in the fullest sense ol the term. The extent of the assistance which he mio-ht be asked to provide for the Allied cause is a question which it is perhaps unnecessary to determine precisely m advance, Ibn Saud may, however, be assured that any requests / • 93* °f suggestions which we might put forward irom time to time v/ould not be unduly onerous or unreasonable, and that we should be prepared to discuss in theTvafof difficultiel 01183 W fulfilment of our wishes.

I explained that in these circumstances it would be best for approach to be made in the first place to Ibn Saud by His Majesty s representative at Jedda and that pending result of such approach Iraqi Emissary should not be sent from Bagdad. This would be the time for His Majesty’s Government &gt; to ascertain fullest reactions of Ibn Saud. Prime Minister raised no objection. Unless I hear from you to the contrary I propose to keep Prime Minister informed of action taken hy us with Ihn Saud and latter's reactions. I assume that His Majesty's Representative will acquaint Ibn Saud of Iraqi intentions and that there will be no question of him proceeding independently to declaration of war. Such action would have disastrous effect here particularly after pressure put on Prime Minister by us to hold his hand for the time being.

I should therefore like an expression of your opinion as to the probable effect of such a declaration by Iraq on the iraqisituation. Would it, for instance ? . facilitate your task and that of the military authorities? I would prefer, in any case, not to commit ourselves finally with regard to General Nuri’s suggestion until we have had time to examine more fully its probable implications, for example in Egypt* 2, It follows also that we shall have to be particularly careful as regards the most important f roblem, viz the manner in which an approach is made to bn Saud. It is difficult to forecast what Ibn Saud s reactions are likely to be to an approach from General Nuri, but they might well be unfavourable* It would probably be better that we should approach Ibn Saud ourselves, and on our own initiative, father than that General Nuri should approach him or that we should merely convey a message from General Nuri. 3. If Ibn Saud should react unfavourably to the suggestion of a declaration of war, or should put forward unacceptable conditions, we could always fall back on course n C^ in my telegram No. 5 to Jedda [of 4tn January]. 4. As regards the further suggestion that the two countries should accede to the Twentysix Power Pact t I cannot interpret a multilateral pact of this kind, without consulting the other signatories and cannot therefore give a definite answer to General Nuri’s enquiry whether under the Pact Iraq would be expected to do more than is laid down in Article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty..

Nuri Pasha proposes that Iraqi Cabinet should 11 pass resolution declaraing a state of war and formally | adhering to the 26 Power Pact and will do this as soon as he ! has full text. He is quite explicit that, whatever the jl attitude of Ibn Saud, Iraqi Government will hold to this 1 1 cours-e-. 5. Immediately after the resolution is passed, Nuri Pasha suggests that we should inform Ibn Saud tnrough Mr. Stonehewer Bird in following sense. [Begins], Iraqi Government has informed Great Britain they intend to declare a state of war and they adhere to the 26 Power Pact within the next week or two, but before making the declaration public, are anxious to consult Ibn Saud. We J understand that an emissary will accordingly be sent by Nuri Pasha in the next day or two to discuss the matter. His Majesty's Government applauds the decision which the Iraqi Government is about to take, and would welcome it if Ibn Saud saw his way to take parallel action. 4, Sir K. Cornwallis and I agree that this appears the best method of procedure and timing, and think it is unlikely to offend Ibn Saud since it is we and not the Iraqi Government who first approach him, and that it brings great but permissible pressure to bear on him, whilst at the same time making it difficult for him to cress strongly on the matter($) referred to in paragraph 4 of my 508* 5. Nuri Pasha wished for some re-assurances that adherence^ to the Pact would not involve Iraq in obligations greater than those laid down in article 4 of the Treaty of Alliance of June 30th 1950. I said I would consult you,/ but at first sight it appeared to me that this was a matter which could be settled between Iraqi and Great Britain privately, [Repeated to Cairo under Foreign Office No, 454, Jedda under Foreign Office No.25 and copies sent to Telegraph Branch, India Office for repetition to Government of India,] A , '' • Vo *3 •OU*- Ao i (&gt;o q . 2 . q. i ^ .

As oetween alternatives (b) and (.g) I favour clear cut declaration of war. Major advantage which we seek is publicity value in the Moslem world of Ibn Sand’s onen association with us; .and from this point of view the declaration of war which would be easily understood and free from any ambiguity would surely have much greater effect than the declaration -suggested-^in alternative (c)* Moreover, it nas a quality of directness likely to appeal to Ibn Sand* I do not favour the suggestion that Ibn Saud [? should] make a declaration ol^ sympathy now and eventually declare war at some later date* His Honour would [? I think] prevent him declaring war when it was too obvious that we were going to be victorious. • 5. I do^not consider that alternative (b) need involve more active participation by Ibn Saud in the war than would alternative (c). He realises the complete dependence of the Arabs/2 Ara*bs on us and has no Illusions about playing an active military part. So far as cam be foreseen ; therefore, he would not expect large supplies of war material from us in return for declaration of war as feared'by Hr, Stonehewer Bird. 4. Matters on which Ibn Saud probably v/ould ask assistance would be: (a) motor transport (for which he has already asked); (b) financial aid and concessions. I presume this need not be serious obstacle; (c) for the rest he might hope for a protective treaty after the war to improve the chances of survival of his dynasty. 5. As regards Holy Cities I see no possible advantage to the Axis in bombing Mecca or Medina*, 6. I agree that in any case we should so far as possible specify at the outset what facilities we want in Saudi Arabia. 7. Considering our relations with Ibn Saud, I think we should give him an opportunity of declaring war first or at any rate simultaneously. When approaching him I should see no objection to our also informing him frankly of v Nuri’s proposal. A premature declaration of War by Iraq might make Ibh Saud reluctant to take.any action and in any case would seriously diminish the value of subsequent declaration of war by him. 8. I am going to Bagdad on January 24th and will telegraph further on the merits and timing of Iraqi declaration of war after discussion with Sir K. Cornwallis. Meanwhile I urge decision on Saudi Arabia be reached as soon as possible so that we can go ahead there in any case. Please communicate decision to me at Bagdad where I shall be until January 27th.

He has on several occasions expressed regret at . being obliged to call on Britain's help in war-time when it should be he who was rendering assistance. I feel therefore ^ that he might be urged to take any one of the three courses suggested I think that he would have a marked preference cj &lt;for (c)l S^lf tebiu. 2. I agree that a declaration of war is difficult for Ibn Saud to justify unless the countervailing advantage to the country m the shape of streams of gold and food and motor vehicles and probabl y- armame nts were assured. I feel that if he declared war his dignifylwould demand his taking an active part or at least being placed in a position to take an active part and that this would entail the arming and equipping of a Saudi army. I do not, in view of the general consensus of opinion in neighbouring countries, wish to minimise the eifects which the declaration of war would have on Moslem opinion but it occurs to me that it might also be said and felt by many Moslems that His Majesty's Government had without justification forced Ibn Saud to expose the homeland to the dangers of war. I think with you that de Gaury may have been swayed by what Ibn Saud said in 1939 when he feared Italy and was striving to obtain a guarantee from His Majesty's Government. Moreover, when de Gaury saw Ibn Saud recently the Germans held Rostov and the Crimea, the Libyan campaign had not started and a threat to the Near East must have seemed less remote to him than at present. If it is eventually decided that the best course would be to ask Ibn Saud to declare war ? I should certainly prefer de Gaury to obtain advance confirmation of his view that the kingdom is ready to adopt this course. “ 3. treaty of alliance would have from His Majesty’s Government's point of view the disadvantages set out in your paragraph L and from Ibn Baud’s point of view that of bJ'&amp;Hor / publicity.

There would be awkward comparisons between the financial advantages'he and, say,' Turkey had derived from the alliance. 1. Course (c) has in my opinion .great advantages. It would not presumably involve Ibn Saud m more active participation than Egypt and the need of supply of large quantities of military equipment would not arise. His needs in money and civil supplies of food and transport would presumably be met in as generous a spirit-as possible but his demands could, I think, be more closely related to the real needs of the country than if course (a) were adopted. 5. I am not quite clear as to whether it is intended if course (c) is adopted to ask Ibn Saud to afford the immediate opportunities mentioned in the second paragraph or whether he is merely to be asked to agree to afford them as and when the military authorities wish, but I feel that in either event it would be best to lay down exactly what is required. He would, for example, wish to know over what parts of his territory air routes are to be developed. For this purpose de Saury’s knowledge of the country and of military questions to be discussed would be of the greatest help and I shall be grateful if he can be spared to assist me when the decision as to the method of approach has been reached.

' . , Cairo telegram No. 4069 to the Foreign Office [of 26th December. Proposed alliance with Ibn Saud]. Chiefs of Staff have reached the conclusion that, from purely military point of view, the advantages of an open alliance with Saudi Arabia would outweigh the dis advantages. 2. The advantages which, from a military point of view, we should wish to gain, include: (1) the opportunity of developing an alternative land line of communications from Koweit to Amman; (2) the more effective policing of Saudi-Arabian frontiers with Transjordan, Iraq and the Yemen. (3) the opportunity of developing and using aerodromes on the Saudi Arabian Persian Gulf coast and in northern Saudi Arabia; (4) the opportunity of developing air routes across Saudi Arabia; (5) increased security against Axis activities in the Red Sea area. 3. It is now for consideration whether these advantages can best be secured (a) by negotiating a treaty of alliance, (b) by a declaration of war by Ibn ,. f Saud on the Axis, or (c) by a simple declaration by Ibn Saud that he has reached the conclusion that every good Moslem-should be on the side ofihe Allies against the powers of evil and that'he is himself prepared to offer the Allies every assistance in his power* 4. Conclusion of a treaty of alliance with us. without a declaration of war, would place Saudi Arabia in a position of Iraq and Egypt* Treaty of alliance would probably /probably however take some time to negotiate. Negotiations might also meet with special difficulties, in view,of the xact that Ihn Saud could hardlv he expectd^. to undertake a-treaty ohligation to furnish 15 on Saudi Arabian territory all facilities and assistance in Ir ^ power'* Uf. Article 4 oi .the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty), He v/ould presumably have to make reservations- at least regarding the.Holy Places, v &amp; • -.A ^ ec lsrstion^ of war by Jbn Baud against the Axis would perhaps^avoid.the necessity for the negotiation of a detailed treaty of alliance* If however we were to urge, this course on Ibn Baud, we should be asking him to do far more than either Trap or Egypt has done. He would tnus^isn to be able to show his people that he was obtaining some special^advantages m return for-having placed them more definitely in the war than the Iraqis and the Egyptians- He would probably therefore think himself bound to make very heavy demands on*us fc 'In - return, e.g. for money, civil supplies, military,eauim ent and arms, which we might have difficulty m providing, . 6, Course, (c), on the other hand, would not seem to be open to these disadvantages, at least to the same extent. It would not necessarily involve the negotiation of a treaty of alliance^ and Ibn'Saud s s declaration could be made on his own^initiative, and not as part of a published agreement. It 'would not involve Saudi Arabia m greater .commitments- or obligations than Egypt and Iraq have already accepted* The; facilities to be granted by him need not be publicly_defined, nor need any public statement be made regarding ‘assistance which we were rendering to Saudi Arabia in return* , . 7, No final decision has. yet been taken here to approach Ibn Baud, and before such a decision is taken, I should be^glad to receive your views on the best way of approaching this question, having regard to the military desiderata in paragraph 2 above* - 8. I shall also welcome your observations on the proposal that de Gaury should return to Riyadh in order to sound Ibn Saud on this subject, leaving you to pursue matters further if Ibn Baud’s reactions are favourable. 9, As some time may elapse before these questions are settled, I think it preferable to secure removal of Italian Legation at once .if we can- 'without awaiting the outcome of major issue, 10. It - appears from de Caury’s report of 20th November enclosed in your despatch No*47 lof 6tn December] just received, that he bases his-opinion of Ibn Baud’s readiness to abandon his neutrality and openly to join the Allies not so much on what-ibn Baud told him on this occasion as on what ibn Baud has stated 'in the past 5 ** Do you share de Gaury’s view, and do you think that Ibn Saud v/ould react favourably^ to one of the three proposals in paragraph 3 above?

Captain de Gaury’s appreciation of Ibn Baud's attitude towards His Majesty's Government is similar to of 30th November, 1939, and No. 170 of 2nd December, 1939), There is however this difference between Ibn Baud's exposes to my predecessor and to Captain de Gaury: the King is now much more open in expressing his hope that His Majesty's Government will assist him materially. I reported in my telegram No. 15 of 18th January, 1940, the form which Ibn Saud considered this assistance might take and I am reporting in a separate despatch the views I have been able to form since my arrival. a that of Sir R. Bullard (please see his despatches No. 169 I have etc., (Signed) F.H.W. Stonehewer-Bird. The Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G.,Enclosure to Mr. F. H. W. Stonehewer-Bird's despatch No. 4 of 20th January, 1940 0 Since we have 'been living in camp my visits to the King every evening, after hunting, have become less formal than morning audiences in the Palace at Riyadh. They have also, except once when he was drowsy after a particularly hard day, been long. Yesterday he spoke first of the people who were tiresome to him because they asked him to define his attitude in regard to the war. He and His Majesty’s Government knew the ties of interest binding them one to another, but such people did not; so they wondered what was his attitude. He asked these people did they think that he could, or would, fight with Germany against Great Britain. What purpose would that serve - with British posts all round Arabia and British ships on the surrounding seas? (The radio news from Berlin may well help to cast doubt in some minds, see for example my telegra m No. 5 6 of 4th January, 1940, about the congratulations he was alleged to have sent to Hitler, and the sending of which he has since denied to me). Such people, he continued, were equally unperceiving about a declaration of neutrality, which was unnecessary. He was not in the road of two warring nations or threatened by the nearness of fighting, so that it would be useful to declare his neutrality. Could they think that he was going to march into Trans-Jordan or Iraq? They must know that that was out of the question. /HeHe extended his talk on these lines and went on to speak of the aerial post across Arabia, via Riyadh, to al Hasa from Jedda, which he hopes to inaugurate very soon with his own aircraft and pilots. From this he turned to the modernization of his land forces. ’’Gradually”, he said, ”as the money comes in from the oil company I shall increase the uniformed army to five or six thousand men to he stationed mostly in Nejd. Not that there will he anything for them to do there hut we must have an army for people and the world to see”. He praised the Neodi as a natural soldier, who takes happily to military training. He also spoke of his relations with the Yemen, with which state he had just made a satisfactory agreement over a frontier matter, the division of flood waters of certain wadis. The impression left on my mind hy this long talk was that he wished to allay any uneasiness we might feel about the future use of the uniformed Saudi Arab army, about which there will very likely be exaggerated reports in neighbouring countries. On the contrary did we but choose he would be content to have a more defined position on the .Allied side. In this case however he would hurry forward the formation of his uniformed army and the improvement of his Air Force, if lack of money were not found a stumbling block. I know that Ibn Saud was not required to enter the war at its outset, presumably because of the military responsibility it must have seemed such a materially weak Ally would become. /NowNow that the situation is changed hy Italy’s attitude perhaps an avowal of his position as being on the Allied side would be advantageous, being a spur to others, and a distinct if light blow to Nazi Germany, and thus worth reconsideration^ If it were thought advantageous and we were to respond agreeably to one of these talks by him, I believe that we should hear more of that word His Majesty so constantly uses, (Maslaha) the meaning of which is benefit or self- interest. He has said to me many times that he has to think always and before all of (a) his religion and what is imposed by it (b) of his independence and its preservation unimpaired (c) the best interests of the Arab brotherhood and then his own ’’MASLAHA”. * It would cost Great Britain something. Whatever may be the decision in this matter, should Ibn Saud receive, during the war, credits on a large scale I think we should receive some benefit in turn from him. As a hard bargainer himself he would expect something of the kind. (He recently reminded me of Captain Shakespear’s mission to him in the last war, in order to make point that he would not receive without giving in return. ”1 gave my word and carried it out”). Sheikh Yusuf Yasin has already suggested credits for imports of foodstuffs from India up to five hundred thousand pounds sterling annually, 'repayable after the war”. Although there are no exports, other than oil from Saudi Arabia as a surety for such credits, there are potential mineral resources, gold in particular, and a remaining oil /concessionJ.upggc concession area, a lien on which might he specified as a substitute acceptable in default of repayment. It seems to me therefore that while obtaining some political advantage v/e could also guard against excessive material loss. In any case, it is my opinion that Ibn Saud will be a disappointed man unless there is some bargaining to be done soon.*H' ^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT A ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 183/183/25] P.Z. .646 1940 j January 15. 1940. Section 1. Copy No. 114 Mr. Trott to Mr. Baggcdlay.—{Received Jamuary 15, 1940.) (Secret.) My dear Lacy, Jedda, December 26, 1939. I SEND you herewith a copy of an interesting letter dated the 16th December received from de Gaury. In telegraphing to me two days later about Ibn Saud’s apprehensions concerning rumours of tension between Iraq and Iran de Gaury referred to this letter and said that Ibn Saud was pressing him for a reply to his recent declaration and his offer to co-operate with us, emphasising the need for early preparations against coming events. So I hope the letter will enable you to form a clearer idea of what Ibn Saud really had in mind in his recent long statement, on which Bullard commented in his despatch No. 160 of the 13th November, 1939.( x ) 2. Perhaps the truth of the matter is, as Yusuf Yasin says, Ibn Saud regards himself as always at war, and wants to do his bit in the present conflict, without quite deciding what that bit is or ought to be. At any rate there is a good deal of material for you and our new Minister to think over. 3. The state of the Saudi finances seems to be worse than we had thought, and, with a small pilgrimage inevitable, the immediate outlook is not rosy. It is a good thing that Bashir as Sadawi, a man of increasing importance, has been instructed to go into the question of cutting down expenditure. 4. As for the methods in which we might help the King, there is one which de Gaury does not mention : it is the formation of a National Bank. You will remember that the Minister of Finance raised this difficult question with me as recorded in my despatch No. 135 E. of the 22nd August, 1939. No doubt what he was really contemplating was getting British help in straightening out accounts which it is impossible to balance, so that the onus of failure could be cast on someone else. The functions and the powers of the bank would have to be very carefully thought out : but it may be possible, with goodwill on the Saudi side, to devise some means of British assistance in getting order out of chaos in Government finance. One great difficulty would be the control of the expenditure of the court. 5. As for the provision of meteorological data, we have already endeavoured to get the permission of Ibn Saud for the importation of meteorological instru ments offered us by the Sudan Government, without much success. Yusuf Yasin seemed to think that instruments erected on our roofs would be liable to misinter pretation. However, de Gaury’s proposal to train the Saudis to record their own meteorological data is on a different footing. The difficulty might be to persuade the Saudis of the necessity of having such data at all : perhaps when some of their ancient aeroplanes crash in bad wmather (which God forbid) they, might see the need more clearly. Yours sincerely, ALAN C. TROTT. Enclosure. Mr. de Gaury to Mr. Trott. (No. 8. Secret.) My dear Trott, Riyadh, December 18, 1939. I HAVE had. as you will have supposed, many audiences of the King since I have been here. Some of them have been very long, and Sheikh Yusuf told me that His Majesty had spoken at greater length than usual. He himself said that he had not talked to anyone so much since his talks with Sir Percy Cox. f 1 ) Eastern (Arabia), December 4, 1939, Section ‘2. [805 p—1]r 9 2. In point of fact he has not so much given me new material as embroidered the theme given in his recent “ declaration,” a copy of which Sir Reader Bullard enclosed with his secret despatch No. 100 of the 13th November to the Secretarv of State. ' ' 3. We have, in our talks, made many excursions—into history, the politics of neighbouring States and so on—and the King’s similes have been vivid and ^ apt but always he has returned to this same theme, which has, nevertheless, remained imprecise. I have come to the conclusion that it is meant to be so. In all his prolonged talks he has never come to a precise conclusion except that once there was mention of practical aid to us in case of need. I was interested to note that Sheikh \usuf has now added to his oft-repeated remark about our giving of 60 million to Turkey and not 60 piastres to Saudi Arabia, “ We are ready to be helped.” 4. His Majesty left me at Kharj alone with his Minister of Finance and the hope that we should spend several days together. He must have been disappointed that I showed little inclination to investigate the murky depths of the State’s finance. 5. With regard to Arab federation I feel sure that if Ibn Saud felt it weie practical he would not so constantly emphasise to me his dislike of the Iraqi Government. He would gloss over their mutual troubles: not fasten on to them. 6. I believe that it is his intention to plant in our minds something like the following idea :— t£ Iraq is unreliable, the French are mismanaging things in Syria, Palestine is troublesome. The only strong man, Ibn Saud, the c friend of Britain,’ who can put this right and bring the Arab States into line, so that they can make a stand against our enemies is powerless because he has no modern army and insufficient money. “ If we give him £11 million a year and some modern equipment he would save the day for us when the time comes.” ^ ^ ?i ve 0Ile an d a half million as a figure because that is the sum Yusuf Yasm suddenly mentioned one day as likely to be the State’s deficit in the coming year. 8. Sheikh Yusuf also gave me another hint. A propos of quite another subject to this he said : “ Tou know the King is really always at war. He has campaigned so much, and had to deal with so many sudden changes in politics, due to war, that he is quick and impatient even in small things.” 9. It would obviously be irksome for such a man as Ibn Saud to continue evenly on the way of peace without any engagement in the “ great opportunity ” now presented. 10. Some remarks dropped in conversation by the intelligentsia of Riyadh, the North African and Syrian officials of the King’s Diwan, lead me to believe that the Government’s finances are in an unhappv condition, but that with borrowings from the C.A.S.O.C. [California-Arabia Standard Oil Company], against future royalties and with economies, with the making of which one of the officials, Bashir-as-Sadawi, has been specially charged, it should be able to keep going until the oil royalties begin to come into the Treasury in full flood in about two years’ time. 11. Subject to any new revelations in this field, I am not of the opinion that it is necessary to subsidise Ibn Saud, although I think that we should keep it m mind. If the prices of food-stuffs rise much' we may have to do so, or come to some helpful arrangement. I am writing to vou separately about this, a subiect raised by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. J 12. With regard to the bigger issue which the King has raised, I do not suppose lor one moment that His Majesty’s Government intend to go all the way with him. Should they go part of the way with him ? Is the picture drawn for me by Yusuf Yasin, of the Iranians supported by Russia turning the flank of Turkey, so fantastic, and what moves do the military authorities anticipate next year' r . . 13 - Ways in which Ibn Saud could be helpful are dependent upon internal developments m the State. Hitherto it has been difficult for him to give any facilities to foreigners or introduce modern developments, but now with the discovery of a first-class oil field, there can be no turning back, and modernisation is settling in rapidly.-v 3 14. The Government should be moving to keep pace with these changes and Ibn Sand knows it. He has recently brought to Riyadh a large number of soldiers and police in uniform. He flouted the priests and there was no resistance. It was a test case and important. Since then there have been many incidents of ^ change which are startling to anyone who knew Riyadh even three years ago. There is talk of the first aeroplane coming to Riyadh, piloted by a Saudi pilot, Abdullah-al-Mandili, from the Hejaz. But with the relaxation of the stern Wahabi code to suit changing conditions, there must be some concomitants of the new order. There must be something like regular pay for State officials and soldiers, and a better organised army and police force. Even rigid economy will not provide a large enough margin for this. 15. This is not of great consequence to Great Britain, it seems to me, unless there is some possibility of our requiring facilities from Ibn Sand later. In that case we should do well to help him put his house in order now. It will be at least two years before he begins to become richer and richer from oil royalties. 16. W r ith regard to the facilities, those which occur to me are— {a) The use of the lateral road along his northern frontier, from Koweit to Transjordan, and either Haifa or Akaba. Repair of this road could be carried out now if he had the money and an engineer. The King, if provided with these, would not object, as it would be advantageous to him to have a good frontier road, as long as he felt our holding in the Koweit Bay was unimpaired. If part of it were ceded by Koweit to Iraq he would no doubt think differently. (b) The use of landing grounds in North and North-Eastern Arabia, the grounds being provided with petrol reserves. This would be advantageous to the King, and if he were provided with the money he might not object to making the necessary improvements and building petrol tanks during the coming year, for the use of his own air force. (c) The provision of meteorological data. His own air force will, or should, presumably require this, and I do not see that there could be any grave objections to a few Saudi Arabs being trained for this work in Egypt, so that in case of need the Saudi Arab Government could arrange to furnish the information to our air force, or, perhaps, to the Bahrein Government for transmission. 17. There are probably other facilities which we might like to have given to us. I have mentioned those which have occurred to me, and the preparation for which need not affect Saudi Arabian neutrality, since they are consonant with a normal programme of modernisation, which the King seems impatient to begin. 18. I believe that His Majesty is genuinely anxious to help if he can, but at the same time he hopes that there will be incidental advantage to him. If we do think that sooner or later we may require facilities, I suggest that the matter be considered and dealt with expeditiously. Everything takes a long time in this country. 19. If the possibility of our requiring Ibn Saud’s “ practical aid ” is very remote, I think we should lead him to understand this. It will make a difference to his plans, and perhaps still the mind of that restless old campaigner, whom we courted in the last Great War. Yours, &amp;c.

No. 156 (S.102/8d/8). SECRET. Jedda. 31st OctolDer, 1939. My Lord, On 22nd April I had the honour to furnish some observations on the question of propaganda in this country, in my secret despatch No. 76 (S23/7C/1), and they were supplemented by a secret despatch No. 123 (S50/SD/4) which was addressed to Your Lordship by Mr. Trott on 18th July, Now that hostilities have been in progress for some weeks I submit a brief report on the question in the light of experience. 2. One may say that except for the Arabic broadcasts from. Berlin there is no organised anti-British propaganda at work in this country. Having decided to remain neutral Italy is obliged to adopt a cool attitude towards Germany to justify her abstention. I have not heard of any printed material being distributed by the Italian Legation since the war began, and although the Legation doctor is active in his non-medical visits there is no reason to think that his propaganda in now anything but defensive. There is fortunately no centre for German propaganda in Saudi Arabia. When asked to leave Iraq the German Minister, Dr. Grobba, naturally wished to make for the other country to which he is accredited, viz. Saudi Arabia, and he asked Ibn Saud for permission to go to Riyadh by land with several cars. Ibn Saud told me that he knew Dr. Grobba wou 1 try to engage /in The Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.Go, &lt;&amp;c., &amp;c. , &amp;C Oin propaganda if he came to this country and that he was resolved not to let him come to Riyadh on any account. He found a reasonable pretext for refusing Dr. Grobba’s request for permission to go to Riyadh by land, and Dr. Grobba left Iraq via Syria, and eventually sailed from Alexandria for Italy. It would be possible for Dr. Grobba to come to Jedda in an Italian or other neutral steamer, but there is no news of his proposing to do so. If the German Government have decided that Dr. Grobba can do us more harm by providing material for the Berlin broadcast than by representing his country in Jedda, they have come to a wise decision, for in one way or another his activities in Jedda would be so severely restricted that they would have little value, even if the human material he had to work upon were more promising. The German broadcasts in Arabic are listened to probably with greater pleasure than ours because the Arabs have no grievance against the Germans as they have against the British, the French, the Turks and the Italians, and because the German station abuses the Jews, but the Jedda people have no influence on policy in this country. To counter this propaganda we can only continue our Arabic broadcasts on the present lines, with the consciousness that to Arabs less far-sighted than Ibn Baud the Germans can present an attractive case* 3. As the result of a squabble in a Jedda coffee-shop, in which a Tunisian employee of the French Legation alleged that he had been abused for criticising an Arabic broadcast from Berlin to which the company had been listening, the French Minister suggested to Fuad Bey that it might be as /wellwell to restrict the use of* wireless sets to private houses in order to avoid such incidents., Prompt action was taken, and an official order (translation enclosed) was issued prohibiting the discussion of the international crisis, on the ground that the Hejaz is the goal of Moslems of various races and political creeds and is a place for worship not for political propaganda. This was supplemented by orders to officials in the same sense, and I understand that the leading persons in Mecca and Jedda were called upon to sign undertakings to abide by the instructions, 4 0 There is every reason to think that if any enemy agent comes to Saudi Arabia with the intention of carrying on anti-British propaganda, his presence will be detected immediately by Ibn Saud, who will nip the attempt in the bud. In the sixth paragraph of my despatch No, 150 dated 14th October I reported on the King’s attitude towards Dr. Ruwaiha, Mizhir al Shawy and Jamal al Husaini. The King’s intelligence service is extremely good: several things that happened while I was in Riyadh proved its efficiency and its promptitude. In particular the papers the King produced showed that he was following every move taken by Mizhir al Shawy with the closest attention. The only German in Saudi Arabia is Herr Hall, of Jedda, and he, owing perhaps in part to the fact that he is half Abyssinian, seems to be honestly anti-Nazi, Qasim. Bey, the renegade Croat (No, 123 in the latest list of ’’Personalities in Saudi Arabia'), was indulging in pro-German talk in his cups at the beginning of the war, but he went to Riyadh with Khalid when the latter returned from Berlin and will probably have seen that the wind is blowing away from Germany. If howeverhe continues his pro-German utterances, I think a word to the King will suffice to reduce him to silence. There is no need for His Majesty's Government to maintain a counter espionage service in Saudi Arabia 'because there should he no espionageo This has already been recognised by the Foreign Office. 5. I see no reason to modify the opinion I expressed in paragraph 5 of the earlier of the two despatches quoted above. Ibn Saud does not wish foreign propapaganda to be distributed in his country, and it suits us best to fall in with his views. When I was in Riyadh I told His Majesty that His Majesty’s Government respected his views on this point and understood the special position of the Hejaz, and I told him that His Majesty's Legation in Jedda was not distributing any propaganda. This does not mean that Ibn Saud does not want information for himself, and perhaps for his leading officials. All suitable material, such as the circular telegrams from the Ministry of Information, will be forv/arded to Captain de Gaury when he takes up his duties at Riyadh, and in the course of his conversations he will be able to give Ibn Saud much information to supplement the B.B.C. Broadcasts and to explain the war news which sometimes puzzles him. because of the inevitable limitations of his knowledge and his experience. 6. I am forwarding copies of this despatch to the Ministry of Information and the Middle East Intelligence Centre. I have etco, (Signed) R.W. Bullard.1^1 Enclosure in Sir R. Bullard’s despatch No, 156 of 31st October, 1939. Translation of Official Coimnunique No. 40 published in the 'Umm al Qura' of 22nd September, 1939. In view of the present international crisis the Government announce that it is not permissible for people to discuss unprofitable matters, taking siues v/ith one party against another, and awarding praise or blame. The Hejaz and its people ought not to interfere in such matters their country being holy and the goal of Moslems of various races and political creeds in all parts of the world. The Hejaz is a place for worship, not for political propaganda. The Government issue this warning, that anyone committing a breach of this order shall be liable to severe penalties consisting of a fine or of fine and imprisonment.t COPY SECRET TV- ^ 1939 , Plotted to Poll tic 7237 5147.

But in the unlikely event of Italy taking such actiofi, His Majesty's Government in their own interests, if for no other reason, would take steps to restore the position, 3c. His Majesty's Government have no reason to suppose that Iraq has any hostile designs against any other State, even including Koweit, The recent Iraqi propaganda about conditionsin Koweit has certainly been trouble some s ment have repeatedly made it clear to the but His Majesty* s G-overn- Iraqi Government that they will not tolerate any modification of its status and this being so they find it difficult to take this propaganda seriously in the sense of supposing it will lead to any deliberate attempt to secure such a modification by force.

Certainly no such federation could be created except after prolonged discussion in which Ibn Saud would be able to make his views fully known* 5a In the opinion of His Majesty's Government the Turkish Government have no intention, apart from the Hatay, of attempting to recover any portion of former Ottoman empire. Continued unrest in Syria, espec]ally in parts adjoining Turkey may, however, make the Turkish Government feel that some action similar to that whi Hi has already resulted in the virtual cession of the Hatay is necessary in Turkish interests. In the interests of Syria two things are im portant if this is to be avoided.

Should general hostilities begin, hov/ever, Italian forces based on Eritrea might conceivably try to /occupy/3. occupy positions on Saudi Arabian coast in order to threaten British communications in Red Sea. At same time it is at least equally possible that Italy might not think that such a policy was worth price of adding Saudi Arabia to her enemies, especially if she were able to occupy equally convenient positions in Yemen or Red Sea islands. In any case His Majesty's Government would in their own interests, if for no other reason, wish to help Saudi Arabia in firecuring evacuation of these positions and unless Italy were successful in over-running Egypt, they do not doubt that this could be effected.■ The assistance of His Majesty’s Government would at first at any rate probably have to be confined to naval and air action, but such action should be sufficient.' 3. His Majesty’s Government have no reason to suppose that Iraq has any 1 hostile designs against any other State, U ^ p j even including Koweit. The recent '•'1 * U ^ ' v kri Iraqi propaganda about conditions in Koweit has certainly been troublesome, but His Majesty’s Government have repeatedly made it clear to the Iraqi Government that they will not tolerate any modification of its status and this being so they find it difficult to take this propaganda seriously in the sense of supposing it will lead to any deliberate attempt to secure such a modification by force. His Majesty’ 1 s Government would welcome any further action A which Ibn Saud might feel disposed to take to impress upon General Nuri the folly of the agitation and propaganda directed against Koweit. 4. Apart from Koweit question, Iraqi Government may look forward to the day when /IraqIraq, will, they hope, play a leading part in a federation with other Arab States, Bxrt here again His Majesty 1 s Government have no reason to suppose that Iraqi Government expeot to create this federation by any but peaceful means.

Wo. 48. oOo I am informed by Yusuf Yasin that General Wuri is going to tgr.undec. ] Hasa by air to meet Ibn Saud and that visit was probably prompted by a severe message which Ibn Saud sent him on April 4th. Message which Yusuf Yasin read to me is to the following effect: 2. If Iraq takes action regarding other Arab states without the consultation with Ibn Saud provided for in treaty [gr.undec.] fears great difficulties may result. Ibn Saud hitherto silent, to conceal differences in Arab world. It was not weakness or lack of experience in war that prevented his taking similar action. Phis no moment for rivalry or individual ambition. The Arabs are on bad terms with Jews, French and British and they have to fear the Turks and Persians. If present tension continues British and French in case of war might give Turkey a free hand in Syria and Palestine in order to be free to use their troops elsewhere (Ibn Saud wishes His Majesty’s Government oo realise that this was inserted to frighten General Wuri not because the rang thinks it nossible) Saudi-Arabia and Iraq must try to bring about arrange ment between Arabs and French and Arabs and British to circumvent Turkish designs on Syria and perhaps secure arrangement between his Arabs and Tulks. Violent propaganda in Iraq may make French and British more determined.

Foreign Office, March 29, 1939. 1HE Amir Faisal came to see me on the 24th March in order to say good-bye befoie leaving London on the conclusion of the conferences on Palestine. His Royal Highness was accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and by Fuad Bey Hamza, who interpreted. 2. His Royal Highness said that he had received from the Prime Minister the day before a letter which Mr. Chamberlain had asked him to convey to King Abdul Aziz in reply to the letter which he had brought to Mr. Chamberlain from his father on his arrival in this country. The Prime Minister had suggested that, if there were any points in this letter which he desired to discuss before his departure, he should do so when he saw me to-day. He was most grateful for the full reply which had been given to his father’s enquiries, and for the frank and friendly tone of the letter as a whole. There were, however, certain points in the letter which were not entirely clear, and he wondered whether there were any additional explanations which I would care to give him. 3. I told His Royal Highness that I was glad of this opportunity to make certain comments upon the letter, as it dealt with one point of fundamental importance about which I would like to say something. This point was the possibility of aggression against Saudi Arabia. King Abdul Aziz had asked, if I remembered rightly, what would be the attitude of this country were Saudi’ Arabia to be the victim of aggression. The meaning of the Prime Minister’s letter upon this point was, I hoped, entirely clear, but the language used was official and diplomatic. I therefore wished to fill in the picture in language which it w T ould be difficult to put on paper. i. I then went on to say that I could not imagine circumstances ever arising in which Saudi Arabia was the victim of aggression by a major Power without (Heat Britain being at war; and if Great Britain were at war, those who were atuacked by her enemies would be her friends, and she would, I was convinced, shape her policy accordingly. Moreover, the facts of geography made it inevitable that Great Britain, with her manifold responsibilities in India, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, should always regard the eastern coast of the Red Sea as an area of vital consequence. I did not think, therefore, that King Abdul Aziz need have any doubt but that, if the case arose, the interests of Saudi Arabia would be found to be the interests of Great Britain. I was not trying to say anything new which was not already said in the letter. I only wished to give additional emphasis to certain points made in the letter. 5. The Amir Faisal said that King Abdul Aziz had never doubted the objects of British policy or supposed that they had changed. But he had felt that the times demanded that his relations with Great Britain should be set out more clearly than might have been necessary hitherto. Since, therefore, the opportunity had occurred he had thought it right to address this enquiry to His Majesty's Government in accordance with the frankness which characterised all his relations with Great Britain. 6. Both His Royal Highness and I had other appointments and the few remaining minutes had to be devoted to Palestine. It must therefore be a matter for speculation whether His Royal Highness would have asked for a guarantee of a more formal and binding character had there been more time for discussion. His Royal Highness did, however, ask Sir Lancelot Oliphant, whom he saw a little later, how the mechanical side of the community of interests between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia would work in a crisis : how soon, for instance, could help from Great Britain reach Saudi Arabia and what form would it take ? His Royal Highness was told that the difficulty of answering hypothetical questions of this kind was as a rule insuperable. But the enquiry would nevertheless be examined with a view to seeing whether there was any'answer which could be sent through you to the Saudi Arabian Government. I 555 ff—1]2 i. 7. Our brief conversation about Palestine was confined to a reference by me to the two main questions which seemed still to be outstanding between the British delegates and the delegates of the neighbouring Arab States. The first question was how soon Palestinian Ministers could become heads of departments. Could this take place at once, or rather as soon as peaceful conditions had been restored in Palestine, or must we wait until His Majesty’s Government and the British authorities in Palestine were satisfied that conditions in Palestine were such as to enable this change to be effected ? I wondered whether a solution of this problem might not be found by agreeing that Palestinian Ministers should be placed in charge of departments within a period of two years from the time when peaceful conditions had been restored. The second outstanding point was the difficulty which had arisen in regard to the end of the transition period. His Majesty’s Government hoped that conditions in Palestine would enable that country to obtain her independence in ten years’ time, but the question arose what should happen if, at the end of ten years, His Majesty’s Government were to decide that the establishment of an independent State must be postponed. My own suggestion would be that in that event we might consult with the Govern ments of Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia before taking a final decision regarding the postponement of the end of the transition period. 8.

RECe.F6C.T5rT^. indIa officeCOPY. (E 2093/177/25). Your Majesty, I have had the honour to receive from His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal the letter addressed to me hy Your Majesty and dated the 2nd January, 1939. I have asked His Royal Highness to he good enough to convey to Your Majesty my respectful thanks for this letter and my keen appreciation of your generous reference to my efforts in the cause of'peace. I am very grateful for the friendliness and frankness with which Your Majesty is always ready to discuss all matters of mutual interest to our two countries. The G-overnment of the United Kingdom greatly value the friendship of Your Majesty and appreciate the assistance they have always received from you, more particularly over the difficult question of Palestine. They share Your Majesty’s view that their community of interests in the Middle East requires that there should he the closest co-operation between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. Your Majesty mentioned in your letter certain points on which you desired to ascertain the views of His Majesty’s Government. The first of these points was the question of Palestine. The Government of the United Kingdom fully realise the importance of this question in its effect not that country hut also on relations between Great Britain and the whole Arab world. The Government of the His Majesty King Abdul Aziz ibn Abdul Rahman A1 Faisal A1 Saud. /UnitedUaited Kingdom are now considering the question of policy in the light of the Conferences on Palestine, which have just 'been discussing the problem and it is not possible at the moment to say more e But His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal, who has played so large a part in the conferences, will have realised, I hope, that it is the sincere and earnest desire of the Government of the United Kingdom to find a final solution which shall do justice to all parties and which shall conserve the rights of the Arabs in Palestine, Secondly Your Majesty enquires what attitude this country would adopt if Saudi Arabia were to be the victim of aggression. As long as relations between Great Britain and the Arab countries remain as they are at present, it is difficult to envisage any aggression on Saudi Arabia by her neighbours« Nor can it be supposed that, leaving aside the possibility of a general war in which the position of Great Britain as a world Power was being challenged, any European Power would wantonly attack Saudi Arabia, especially as the Government of the United Kingdom have made it clear how deep is the interest that they take in the preservation by Saudi Arabia of her independence and integrity. The declarations of the Government on this subject correspond to one of the major interests of British Imperial policy, and I personally think that these declarations are sufficient by themselves to deter potential aggressors (except, as I say, in the possible eventuality of a general challenge to Great Britain), since the nature of this policy and the grounds on which it is based must be apparent to the Governments of all other States, /WithWith regard to the proposal for mutual consultation on all matters affecting Arab countries, Your Majesty is aware that the Government of the United . Kingdom desire at all times to obtain your views on such matters. They will welcome every opportunity to consult with Your Majesty on all questions involving the common interests of the two countries. In your fourth point, Your Majesty asks that you may be given an opportunity of expressing your views before any change is introduced in the status of any Arabic speaking country. So far as the Government of the United Kingdom can judge, there is no prospect (apart from Palestine - and Syria and the Lebanon - whose future status is now under discussion) of a change in the status of any Arabic speaking country. But should the Arab countries at some future time desire closer union or some form of federation, Great Britain would consider this to be a question for negotiation and decision among the Arab States themselves. Certainly the Government have no intention of taking any initiative in this question, more especially as it will scarcely be practicable for Palestine or Syria to participate in a federation for a considerable time. It is possible, however, that Your Majesty, in framing this question, was thinking less of federation than of the future status of Transjordan. The Government of the United Kingdom cannot tie their hands in regard to a question for which they are responsible to the League of Nations, by giving undertakings about this question to third parties. But should the possibility arise of changes in Transjordan, they will certainly remember that any changes in a neighbouring / territoryterritory of this kind must always he of especial interest and concern to Your Majesty and will take this factor into account in framing their policy. with regard to the suggestion that the two countries should decide beforehand on the attitude to he adopted towards a third State whose policy may affect our common interests, the Government of the United Kingdom, while they would welcome mutual consultation on such points as may arise, feel that in view of the impossibility of foreseeing what action a third State may take in the future, it would he unwise and dangerous for the two Governments to attempt now to lay down a common policy to meet all eventualities. I would, nowever, say this. Any action which tends to weaken the position of Great Britain in the Middle East must inevitably tend to expose the Middle Eastern Powers to greater danger than at preseno, for none of those Powers as yet possesses the military and other resources necessary to make an effective stand against any Power which was able to usurp the place of Great Britain in the Middle East. No other Power is likely to fill the place of Great Britain without wishing to acquire extensive rights of interference in the political and more especially the economic affairs of the Middle Eastern countries and the best service which those who have the interests of the Middle Eastern States at heart can render to those States is to persuade them to discourage firmly all activities such as- the dissemination of progaganda which are likely to undermine, the position either of Great Britain or of 1 ranee.- This is, however, a point upon which I may not have wholly grasped Tour Majesty's meaning and if /Your2023 Your Majesty would care to inaku further -through Sheikh Hafiz Wahl)a or Sir Reader Bullard the Government of the United Kingdom will he most happy to consider them. Finally, Your Majesty requests a definition of the meaning and extent of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April, 1938. This Agreement is an agreement between Great Britain and Italy alone. No other Power is asked to recognise or to be bound by it. The relations between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia are therefore governed by their treaties and by their friendship alone, and the Anglo- Italian Agreement does not indicate the slightest pretension on the part of the Government of the United Kingdom to restrict the liberty of action of Saudi Arabia. I am prepared, if Your Majesty thinks it desirable, to reply more fully on this point in answer to the note-verbale handed to Sir Reader Bullard on the 13th November, 1938. I would conclude by assuring Your Majesty once again how highly the Government of the United Kingdom value the relations of confidence that so happily exist between Your Majesty and Great Britain. I have little doubt that Your Majesty will share my vio-w, that this confidence and the clear community of interests that exist between our two countries are the best assurance for the maintenance of those good relations on which both countries so greatly dex^end. I have asked His Royal Highness to convey to Your Majesty, with my respectful compliments, my sincere good wishes for your long life and prosperity. I am, etc., (Sd.)

Their Lordships consider it important, however, that the term ’’vital necessities” used in the last sentence of paragraph 6 should be replaced by some less significant phrase, such as ’’major interests”. It appears to n heir Lordships that to describe the British declarations on the subject of the integrity of Saudi Arabia as springing from vital necessities may lead the Government of that country to form the conclusion that, notwithstanding the refusal of any formal commitment earlier in the letter, they could rely on the intervention of H.M.Government in all circumstances in the event of an attack by another European power.

I feel that it might have been better, in the circumstances, to have drafted in more general terms, and perhaps to have given prominence to some offer to include a provision for consultation in any new treaty which may be negotiated with Saudi Arabia. There is, of course, no time to suggest a recasting of the draft as a whole. Apart from its substance, however, its wording seems in places to give an unnecessarily chilly impression, and there are one or t'*'o points of wording which we might, I think, tentatively suggest to the F.O. They may not feel able to accept the suggestions, but there seems no harm in making them. iUjdraft letter to the F.O,, which is self-explanatory, is submitted in regard to these points. There has been considerable correspondence (on the file below) with the Saudi Arabian Govt, about the Anglo- Italian agreement, and it appears from this that they have felt that the references in this agreement to the common interests of the parties in Saudi Arabia, and its conclusion without consultation with them, are rather derogatory/derogatory to their position. Matters were not improved by a legalistic and somewhat schoolmasterly explanation ,iven by the F.0. last July. The Saudi Govt, have now addressed identic notes to the British and Italian Govts, to which it is proposed to send a reply flagged on the file that ought, one would hope, to remove their misgivings. It seems to me that it might be desirable that the Prime Minister’s reply to Ibn Saud should be confined to the substance of what it is proposed to say officially. Part of the F.O. draft seems to expose surface for further misunderstanding^ Ik u/LuJ* t crsu. / tAcJLL^j 4 4 J+r- Ufu^ t The correspondence which has already taken place also suggests some doubt whether Ibn Saud would relish the t reference proposed in another part of the draft to our interest in the preservation of the independence and integrity of Saudi Arabia. Possibly, however, this will be all right in the present context. We might suggest the point for the consideration of the F.O. without pressing it. It is a pity that the F.O. cannot go further than they propose on Ibn Saud’s fourth suggestion (to agree not to introduce any change in the status app of any Arabic speaking country which may adversely affect his interests without first affording him an adequate opoortunity to express/o express his views). Their draft is rather evasive on this point; but as they have Trans-Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon specifically in mind and are evidently anxious to avoid any promises, it is not a matter on which we need comment.the/ u.s.s., P.O.

Lord Zetland would like to offer, for th€ consideration of Viscount Halifax the / following observations on a few points in the draft, j As it is understood that when the reply issues the Conferences on Palestine will be practically concluded and that it will only remain to announce H.M.G.’s proposals, it sdems doubtful whether it would be useful to include the third sentence of the paragraph of the reply dealing with Palestine. An alternative might be to state n |he London discussions oji this problem are now drawing to their close and Your Royal Highness. . .” (as in the following sentence) ^ The paragraph dealing with King Abdul Aziz's second point contains a re-fere nee -ter the fact that H.M.G. have made it clear how deep is the interest that they take in the preservation of0 }%) the/ 2 . the independence and integrity of Saudi Arabia.

Lord Zetland presumes that Lord Halifax is satisfied that, notwithstanding the previous correspondence, King Abdul Aziz will not in the present context take amiss the phrasing of this part of the proposed reply to his second point. If so, he has no observations to offer thereon. In the contrary event the phrase- might-, by a small drafting alterationy-bc made to read 'the preservation by Saudi Arabia of her independence and integrity'. j^With reference to the paragraph of however, that in paragraph 12 of S ■&gt; ■&lt;*-»3 the draft which deals with Ihn Saud’s fifth point Lord Zetland would suggest that, with a view to further softening the negative character of the reply on this point, it might he desirable to reiterate that H.M.G. are always willing to consult with Ihn Baud on questions affecting their^interest*. This might he done hy inserting^ after the words 'the Government of the U.K.' in the first sentencej the words 'while they would welcome mutual consultation on any such questions that may arise'. As regards the proposed reply to Ihn Baud’s sixth point Lord Zetland notes from the previous correspondence that the Saudi Government appear to have taken umbrage on account of the references to Saudi Arabia contained in the Anglo-Italian agreement which was concluded without prior consultation with them. As the Saudi Arabian Government have now addressed C an identic note to H.M.G. and^the Italian Government, who are understood to he in agretment as to the substance -VK. fC ['US)**-, of the' anodyne reply to he returned thereto, Lord Zetland would suggest for consideration that it might he best to-leave the official reply which is to he returned to the Saudi Government on this/X •-'i In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. E 1444/177/S5. andyatidress— n to any person by name but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. ^mediate. r 0 ,9' 1 0/- i 9 j^ ^IGNj Ol )FFICE.

Nor can it be supposed that, leaving aside the possibility of a general war in which the position of Great Britain as/as a world Power was being challenged, any European Power would wantonly attack Saudi Arabia, especially as the - Government of the United Kingdom have made it clear how deep is the interest that they take in the Government on this subject correspond to one of the vital necessities of British Imperial policy, and I personally think that these declarations are sufficient by themselves to deter potential aggressors (except, as I say, in the possible eventuality of a general challenge to Great Britain), since the nature of this policy and the grounds on which it is based must be apparent to the Governments of all other States.

They will preservation/of the independence and integrity The declarations of the welcome/© welcome every opportunity to consult with His Majesty on all Questions involving the common interests of the two countries 0 In his fourth point; His Majesty asks that he should he given an opportunity of expressing his views before any change is introduced in the status of any Arabic-speaking country. So far as the Government of the United Kingdom can judge, there is nj prospect (apart from Palestine - and Syria and the Lebanon - whose future status is now under discussion) of a change in the status of any Arabic-speaking country,, But should the Arab countries at some future time desire closer union or some form of federation. Great Britain would consider this to be a question for negotiation and decision among the Arab States themselves» I cannot speak w r ith absolute certainty for all future Governments, but certainly the present Government has no intention of taking any initiative in this question, more especially /asas it will scarcely be practicable for Palestine or Syria to participate in a federation for a considerable time. It is possible, however, that His Majesty, in framing this question, was thinking less of federation than of the future status of Transjordan. The Government of the United Kingdom cannot tie their hands in regard to a question for which they are responsible to the League cf Nations, by giving undertakings about this question to third parties. But should the possibility arise of changes in Transjordan, they will certainly remember that any changes in a neighbouring territory of this kind must always be of especial interest and concern to His Majesty and will take this factor into account in framing their policy. With regard to the suggestion that tho two countries should decide beforehand on the attitude to be adopted towards a third State /inin view of the impossibility of foreseeing what action a third State may take in the future, it would be unwise and dangerous for the two Governments to attempt now to lay down a common policy to meet all'.eventualities» I would, however, say this 0 Any action which tends to weaken the position of Great Britain in the Middle East must inevitably tend to expose the Middle Eastern PoY/ers to greater danger than at present, for none of those Powers as yet possesses the military and other resources necessary to make an effective stand against any Power which was able to usurp the place of Great Britain in the Middle East 0 No other Power is likely to f ill the place of Great Britain without wishing to acquire extensive rights of interference in the political and more especially the economic affairs o.f the Middle Eastern countries and the best service/service which those who have the interests of the Middle Eastern States at heart can render to- those States is to persuade them to discourage firmly all activities such an the dissemination of propaganda which are likely tD undermine the position either of Great Britain or of Prance, This is, however, a point upon which 1 rmp not have wholly grasped His Maj esty meaning and if His Majesty would care to make further suggestions through Sheikh Hafiz Wahba cr Sir Reader Bullard the Government of the United Kingdom will 1 e most happy to consider them. Finally, King Abdul Aziz requests a definition of the meaning and extent of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April, 1938, This Agreement is an agreement between Great Britain and Italy alone. No other v Jwe p p s asked to recognise or to be bound by it.

The relations between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia a.re therefore governed by their treaties and by their friendship alone, and the Anglo-Italian Agreement does not indicate the slightest pretension on tide part of the Government of the United Kingdom to restrict the liberty of action of Saudi Arabia, I am prepared, if Your Royal Highness thinks it desirable, to reply more fully on this point * in answer to the note-verb ale handed to Sir Reader Bullard on the 13th November, 1938,•— 1 ! 1G21 I I would conclude by asking Your Royal - [ i9-59 j Highness to assure His Majesty once a gain 'How highly His Majesty’s Government value the relations of confidence that so happily exist between His Majesty and Great Britain.

Indeed, the course of events and the sequence of political and military eventualities5, n make it obligatory on us to do our utmost to strengthen them, on the basis of our mutual Interests and our common goal, for the following important reasons:- !♦ 'he two seas between which our country is situated constitute two of the most impcrtfint arteries of British Imperial communications. 2, The air routes most important to the British j'apire, as well as the petrol pipe line from ^osul, lie near to our northern frontiers, S, Our country is the centre of the rab race and of the Arabic speaking nations, to whom dr eat Britain is bound'by important interests. 4.

British Legation, Jedda. 5rd August 1957. Sir, As I have already nad the honour to report in my telegram No* 69 of August 1st, the Amir Sand, accompanied by his brother the Amir Muhammad, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, and his suite, returned to Jedda on the 1st August. 2. On the previous evening a printed notice was received by me at a late hour, setting forth the programme of reception; the ship was due to arrive about 8 a.m. His Royal Highness would be received at the Customs quay, where the diplomatic corps would be looked after by a certain Jamil Davud, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and so forth. I am informed by some of my colleagues that this was the first occasion on which such a printed notice has been circulated; but I was evidently fortunate in receiving it the previous evening, as most of the 'corps diplomatique' did not receive it till the morning of the reception. 5. Mr. Gault and I arrived at the Customs building at 8 am. and found a large airy shed, elaborately carpeted and provided with chairs. a broad central passage between two blocks of chairs led up to the seat of honour, behind which were/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, H.C., M.P. &amp;c», &amp;c., &amp;c.were about thirty other seats. The Chief of Customs greeted us, and Jamil Davud informed me of my serial number in the diplomatic order of precedence« The diplomatic corps were given seats on one side of the central passage, the other side being reserved for great personages such as the Guardian oi the Keys of the Kaaba, the Director of Education, the Censor of Morals, and many other persons of note, almost all of whom had come to Jedda the previous day, 4, The Amir Feisal arrived soon after 8 a.m. and greeted the diplomatic corps, the introductions being made oy Jamil Davud. The Amir sat first in the chair of honour, tne chairs behind him being allotted to about thirty members of the Royal family; I was told that most, but not all, of them 7/ere the offspring of King Abdul Aziz. The weather was sultry, and though the customs shed has been well d3signed to catch any sea breeze which may be blowing, the diplomatic corps, as well as some of the Arabs, seemed glad to repose in their comfortable chairs and wait for the arrival of the Heir Apparent, Four aeroplanes circled round at intervals. The crowd included many picturesque types of Arab; merchants with their old-fashioned Hejazi hats, young students, fierce soldiers with rifles and full bandoliers, and grave mujtahids from the Holy places all rubbed shoulders, making a many- coloured throng. 5. At about 9.15 a.m. the Amir Saud and his companions arrived at the quay and were escorted to the shed. The Amir Feisal and the other royal personages having greeted the two Amirs very affectionately, all the other Arabs thronged around to salute them, with kisses on the face, or on the hand, or with/I with hand-clasps, according to rank. The Amir Baud behaved with great dignity and charm, and appeared to me to he in excellent health and spirits. 6 . The Diplomatic corps were presented by the Amir Peisal and Jamil Davud. The Amir Baud shook hands with each. He then took his seat on the chair of honour which the Amir Peisal had vacated, and various addresses of felicitation were read or recited to him. The first was an address of welcome, which contained a reference to the accident which had taken place in Scotland; the speaker’s congratulations on the Prince’s happy escape evoked a burst of applause. The court poet then came forward and recited a lengthy ode with much vigour and with flashing eyes. I was disappointed to observe that he did not adhere to ancient tradition and recite his poem from memory; he quite openly had his poem written on a paper in his hand, and referred to it before every line. The perspiration poured off his nose and out of his beard as he worked himself into paroxyms of loyalty, but the drops did not obliterate the writing and he let the audience have the full benefit of every word. The heat was not the only thing he had to contend with; aeroplanes swooping down over the shed with a deafening roar, just missing the roof, drowned his voice; bursts of clapping in the middle of elegant lines spoiled the effect of the final vowel; but he was determined to let us have it all, and repeated, sometimes three times, those parts of the poem which he thought had not been properly heard. After him a little boy, with a squeaky voice, repeated, from memory this/^ this time, a long poem of welcome from the schoolboys of Jedda; and then an older boy gave us another eloquent address of welcome, ending by a series of what might be called antiphonal responses from his comrades in the assembly. An aged poet from Medina also read a poem, full of eloquence but without so much of the fire which had distinguished the previous speakers. '7. The ceremony was now drawing to its close. The Amir Saud addressed a few v/ords to the Diplomatic corps, thanking them for their attendance, and I believe that the dean of the Diplomatic corps, Monsieur Hakimoff, the Soviet Minister, replied shortly in suitable terms. The Amir then rose and shook hands with all the members of the Diplomatic Corps in their order of precedence; and I was able to offer him congratulations in Arabic. He, in reply, said what an excellent time he had passed in the United Kingdom and asked me again to thank all who had been so kind to him. We were then able to depart, and to take off the collars and ties which are so seldom worn here, and which aggravate the unpleasantness of living in a moist heat which has not gone much below 90 degrees Fahrenheit for several days and nights. 8 . As we drove back through arches decorated with green and white Mr. Gault told me that he had heard from a member of tne French Legation that a demonstration against the Palestine Report had been staged for just after the ceremony of greeting. Nothing of the sort happened, however, 9. I was much impressed by the dignified appearance and bearing of the Amir Saud. It also appeared that everyone was very pleased to see him back; old inhabitants of Jedda say that all these ceremonies are engineered and ordered by the/the government; but it really did appear that the people who attended the reception were genuinely glad to see the Heir Apparent return. Much dancing and jollity has been arranged in the streets of Jedda during the past few days; perhaps Arabs are used to dancing round fires in a moist heat of 90 degrees; but it seemed to me that everyone was really quite pleased. 10. At 3 p.m. that afternoon I was received by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I found him attired only in a large white towel; he did not explain this costume until the end of our interview when he said he was going to Mecca to perform a f towaf’ or circumambulation. He was very agreeable, and repeated how pleased the Princes had been at their stay in England. I understand that all tne returning party left Jedda for Mecca on the evening of the day they arrived. I have? etc. (Signed) A.C. Trott.SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Notes. Minute Paper. Register No. P. Z. 2918 /37. Dated Bee. 193 . h. Date. Initials. SUBJECT. To Under Secretary... Secretary of State.

FOR INFORMATION. ^ (((L li. v SEEN POLITICAL COMIvn^TER. Zl l:--\ Previous papers :— Mr. Rendel, the head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office, made an unofficial tour of the Middle East this spring, in the course of which he spent a few days at Jedda. During his stay, he and H.M. Minister had several conversations with the King. The Rmp despatches now submitted describe the visit and conversations. The main points discussed appear to have been:- (I) The general relations between Ibn Saud and H. M.G. , in regard to which Ibn Saud was inclined to complain that although he had given much help to H.M.G., particularly during the war, he had received little in return. 3643 1000 3.35 (2)/2. ( 2 ) The Yemen , its disturbed political condition, the probability of chaos on the Imam’s death, and the danger of Italian penetration . In regard to this, Ibn Saud seemed to show genuine alarm at the Italian danger and a real desire for some definite promise by H.M.G of protection against it. He seemed, however, to be reassured when Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Rendel pointed out that whiilLH. M.G. could not give any such formal undertaking, Saudi and British interests in this matter are clearly identical, and community of interests is a stronger bond than treaties. (3) The South Eastern Frontier Question , as to whifcjk it became clear that Ibn Saud Is in no hurry to settle this question, which has for so long been under discussion. (4) Palestine, as to which a separate submission has ^ ^ already been made. It seems that Ibn Saud’s attitude and manner was most cordial throughout. 8 JUN1937f Sla any further communication on this subject, please quote | no. f/jh A?r/r ! and address —not to any person by narnJ,\h\si to— i 99 IQ i “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.'V r .

[E 1961/92/25] Copy No. 116 Si?’ R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received April 12.) (No. 41.) Sir, Jedda, March 23, 1937. IN my despatch No. 40, dated the 23rd March, I reported that during' Mr. Rendehs short stay in Jedda, from the 17th to 22nd March, we had several interviews with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. I now have the honour to enclose a summary of these conversations. The conversations themselves and unavoidable hospitality occupied most of the time during the last two and half days, so that there was not time to make a complete record before Mr. Rendel’s departure. 2. It might have been more satisfactory to divide the record up into portions according to the various subjects discussed, and to send each portion separately with a covering despatch, but there is not time to do this before the bag goes, and in any case the subjects overlap a good deal. Where comment seems to be called for i hope to send it by the following bag, and the question of Palestine, at any rate, requires a telegram. 3. In two or three places I have inserted material which may appear to be remote from present-day politics, e.g., references to Ibn Sand’s relations with the Sherif (later King) Hussein and to his dealings with British officials in the Persian Gulf before the war. I think these references are relevant as showing that the mind of the King is always roving back to the times when, as he thinks, he deserved well of His Majesty’s Government and reflecting that he has got precious little out of it. I am not saying, at the moment, that any bitterness that Ibn Saud feels on this score is justified, but only that it exists. 4. I have been more than six months at this post, but it was not until now that I could come into contact with the man who directs foreign affairs, as he directs everything else in Saudi Arabia. The peculiar position in which foreign representatives are placed in this country is familiar to you, but it may be of use to illustrate it from my short experience. I arrived at Jedda in the middle of last September, and presented credentials to and dined with the Amir Feisal, a purely nominal Minister for Foreign Affairs, who at once retreated to the hills of Taif. The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey, was on leave, and did not return until towards the end of November, and for two months I saw no one connected with foreign affairs except the King’s secretary, Yusuf Yasin, who came to Jedda at the end of September to arrange for the exchange of notes about the Treaty of Jedda and connected matters, communicated a long statement from the King about foreign affairs, and retired to the other side of Arabia. Between the return of Fuad Bey towards the end of November and his hurried and surprising departure on leave a few days before Mr. Rendel was due to arrive, I have had occasional interviews—sometimes at tiresomely long intervals—with Fuad Bey, whom there is reason to think that the King does not entirely trust, and who I think has misled me on one or two occasions. 5. I may mention that during the course of the conversations reported in the enclosure the King twice said that he hoped I would pay him a visit at Riyadh. For many reasons such a visit is not to be undertaken lightly, but it may be useful to have the invitation in hand if matters of importance have to be dealt with and no satisfaction can be obtained here during the long interval between two successive annual visits of the King to Jedda, the only place in Saudi Arabia where a foreign representative is allowed to reside. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. [981 m—5] B2 Enclosure. Record of conversations in the course of interviews granted by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz to Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Rendel on March 20, 21 and 22, 1937. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba were present throughout, and the Amir Feisal appeared on two occasions. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sir Reader Bullard interpreted. First Interview, March 20. The King began by laying down the principles which governed his life : (1) his religion, (2) his determination to keep his name above reproach, and (3) devotion to his religion and to the interests of his subjects. He was a self-made man, having started with nothing in the world, and provided that he stuck to his principles he was prepared to go back to nothing. Times were changing, the pristine honesty of the world was declining, but he would never pursue a crooked path. He believed in consulting everyone, but no one could lead him by the nose. He would always speak to His Majesty’s Government frankly and sincerely. All sorts of stories were afloat about his subservience to the Italians, but he could assure His Majesty’s Government that they were nonsense. Mr. Rendel said how much the King’s frankness was appreciated by members of the Government in Great Britain, and Sir Reader Bullard said that he was sure that the King was never suspected by His Majesty’s Government of subservience to Italy, and that His Majesty’s Government knew that his policy was directed to what was their object as well as his, viz., the maintenance of the independence of Saudi Arabia. 2. Ibn Sand said that he was a Moslem first of all, but he believed that of all the European Powers the one with whom it was to the advantage of the Arabs everywhere to be on good terms was Great Britain. After some talk on these lines Sir Reader Bullard took the opportunity to convey the thanks of His Majesty’s Government for the advice which the King had given to the Mufti of Jerusalem when the mufti appealed for his help recently (Foreign Office telegram No. 12 of the 1st March). The King expressed pleasure at this mark of appreciation of his efforts and repeated what he had said to the mufti (he had advised him to co-operate with the British in maintaining order and to await the result of the Royal Commission), and he said that he had also warned the mufti not to let himself be made an instrument for Italian intrigues. He went on to say that he wanted the whole £&lt; bundle ” of Arab States to be on good terms with His Majesty’s Government. He was not thinking of Palestine for the moment; that question was being considered, and he trusted that a solution would be found that would be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, to the people of Palestine, and to the Arabs in general. No, he was thinking of danger which threatened the Arab world in two places, the Yemen, and Iraq. 3. First the \ emen. I he Yemen was in a ferment. The whole country was against the heir apparent, Ahmad, while the Imam said “yes” to everyone, but did nothing. When three of the sons of the Imam came on the pilgrimage recently, Sayyid Husain spoke to the King about the situation in the Yemen and asked for his advice. If there was a revolt in the Yemen, what would be the attitude of (1) Ibn baud, and (2) the Italians ? According to Sayyid Husain— and Ibn baud knew it to oe true—the whole population without exception hated Ahmad and the Foreign Minister, Raghib, a Turk who is in Italian pay. They had asked for the removal of Raghib, but he was protected by Ahmad. They had sent the Imam a written protest (here the King gave us a copy), but without eflfect. If they were free they would revolt and sweep away both Raghib and Ahmad, and the Imam too if he opposed this popular movement 4. To this enquiry from Sayyid Husain, Ibn Sand said he had replied that, as foi himself, he proposed to observe a policy of complete neutrality and non-intei vention m Temen affairs. He had withdrawn once when he might have occupied the Yemen, and he did not propose to reverse that policy. If there should be tiquble in the Yemen, the most he could do would be to consult other Ai ab countries if asked by both sides to try to make peace, and to see what could be done to give effect to the request. As to Great Britain and Italy, Ibn Sand had told Husain about the Rome understanding of 1927, and had said that both the British and the Italians had assured him that it was their firm desire that3 the independence of the Yemen should be maintained. In conclusion, Ibn Saud declared vehemently that there must be an outbreak in the Yemen—perhaps before the death of the Imam. In that event, what would the Italians do and what would be the attitude of His Majesty’s Government? 5. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the ^ dangers of the situation in the Yemen. There was no doubt that the Italians had been, and still are, intriguing actively in that country and would be very ready to fish in the waters they had helped to trouble. But while the internal situation was perhaps more dangerous than it had been, he was inclined, for the following reasons and speaking purely personally, to doubt whether the Italian danger was now quite as acute as it had been a year ago. In the Rome / understanding of 1927 His Majesty’s Government had made it quite clear, and the Italians had formally recognised, that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as “a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” (At this point Sir Reader Bullard gave King Ibn Saud, for convenience of reference, a copy of an Arabic translation of the relevant text, which had already been communicated to His Majesty by Sir Andrew Ryan.) There was, of course, no reason to trust any Italian promises as such, but it was obvious that, in view of the terms of the Rome understanding, any attempt by Italy to establish herself in the Yemen would be a direct challenge to His Majesty’s Government. No doubt Italian hotheads, possibly Italian local officials, cherished designs on the Yemen. But Italian policy would be directed from Rome, and present indications suggested that for European reasons, and in view of British rearmament, Italy was not now anxious to embark on any conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but was rather seeking to establish better relations. Even if this view should prove mistaken, he did not think King Ibn Saud need be seriously disturbed by Italian activities in the Yemen. Saudi and British interests were closely parallel, and it was difficult to see how any development which threatened Saudi independence could fail equally to threaten British interests, so that the probability was that, in any such event. Ibn Saud would, in any case, find Great Britain at his side. At a later interview the opportunity was taken to mention that the Italians themselves seemed anxious to keep the Rome understanding alive, and apparently feared a forward policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government (see Foreign Office despatch to 1 Jedda, No. 182 of the 24th February). 6. Mr. Rendel added that he understood (from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba) that His Majesty wished to know the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards his suggestion for an exchange of information about the Y r emen, &amp;c. Mr. Rendel saw no reason why this should not be possible. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to pass on to Ibn Saud any information of interest which they could properly communicate to him, though in doing this they would, of course, be assuming that Ibn Saud was satisfied that there would be no risk of leakage at the Saudi end. 7. Ibn Saud then turned to Iraq. He had good information, for people wrote to him from all parts of the Arab world and he had seen many Iraqi pilgrims, and the reports all tallied with each other. Everyone was suspicious of the new Iraqi Government and regarded it as not Arab. There had been much to be said against Yasin-al-Hashimi, who had even gone so far as to ask Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to tell Ibn Saud to beware of the British Government, but at least his policy was an Arab policy. To the policy of the present Iraqi Government there were two objections : it was communistic, and it was under Turkish influence. The Turks had begun by trying to get possession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, and their next aim would be to acquire Mosul. 8. Mr. Rendel said that the title of Communist was sometimes misapplied to anyone who favoured economic social reform. He understood that such reforms were long overdue in Iraq, where there was much extreme poverty, and it was possible that Hikmet Suleiman’s legislation was necessary, and was not imposed in any spirit of communism. It might be well, therefore, to reserve judgment on this point until the Amir Saud and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba should have seen the situation for themselves during their impending visit to Bagdad. (Here Ibn Saud said that Hikmet Suleiman did not care a rap for the poor or for anyone.) As to Turkish influence, Mr. Rendel believed that, while the maker of the military couf d’Etat, Bakr Sidqi, and some of his military associates, might be described as pro-Turkish, Hikmet Suleiman showed signs of wanting to shake [981 m — 5] b 24 himself free of military influence, and the longer he could maintain his Govern ment, the more hope there was that he would become less dependent on the army’s support. As to the attitude of the Turkish Government, a year ago Mr. Ken del would have scouted the suggestion that Turkey might embark on a policy of adventure. In this opinion he had been seriously shaken by Turkey’s Alexandretta policy, but the Turks had not “got away with it” over Alexandretta, and they had, he thought, felt themselves much isolated at Geneva and had retreated from the extreme position they had taken up. The fact that the Turks had received so marked a check over Alexandretta ought, he felt, to make them much less likely to put forward any other similar claims in future. Second Interview, March 21. 9. Ibn Saud said that he wanted to make some remarks under four heads :— (1) His relations with His Majesty’s Government. (2) The Arabs in general. (3) Palestine. (4) The future. The interview went on for over two hours, but never got beyond the first head. Ibn Saud went over the whole course of his relations with His Majesty’s Govern ment from the moment when he first entered into communication with them through the Political Agent at Bahrein, and suggested that their common interests demanded that the Turks should not be allowed to establish themselves strongly in the Arabian Peninsula, and received an assurance that His Majesty’s Government would not allow the Turks to approach him either by sea or through Koweit. He recited his dealings with Sir Percy Cox during the war, recalled the loyalty with which he had offered to help the Sherif Hussein against the Turks, and spoke of the “guarantees” which he had received from Sir Percy Cox. Nothing whatever had come of these “ guarantees,” though he had been promised “all sorts of things.” He had assisted the Arab policy of His Majesty’s Government by communicating to them the written and oral offers which he received from the Turks as an inducement to him to join them against Hussein— offers which he refused, alleging that he could not move against the British because they were his neighbours on the Gulf, and saying that, in any case, he could not join the Turks when they were slaughtering Arabs. At first he even told His Majesty’s Government that he would accept Hussein as King of the Arabs, but later he was obliged to withdraw this offer. He told Hussein that the resources in money and arms which were supplied by the British were being wasted through being dealt out to the various sheikhs according to the number of followers they said they had, and asked that, if he sent his son and some men to help, they should only be given arms for themselves and food to eat, and Hussein had replied that Ibn Saud must be either mad or drunk. Ibn Saud thereupon informed the British Government that he must lay down two conditions : that he would not recognise Hussein as King of the Arabs, though he did not object to his being King of the Hejaz, and that when the war was over His Majesty’s Government should allow him to settle his own scores with Hussein. He had always listened to the advice of His Majesty’s Government, even to his own hurt. On more than one occasion he had fallen out with his chief supporters, the Ikhwan, for that reason, e.g., when he retook Turaba, which the Sherifians had unjustly occupied, and His Majesty’s Government asked him not to go any further; when he refrained at the reo^est of His Majesty s Government from taking Aqaba, where the ex-King Hussein was staying, and Maan; and when he listened to the mediation of the British agent at Jedda and ensured the peaceful occupation of the city to the disappointment of some of his followers. For all this loyal support, and after all the promises made to him, what had he got ? Nothing whatever. On the contrary ! 10. He would put his complaints under three heads :— (a) His Majesty’s Government had not given him the help he needed. (b) Their boundary policy was always squeezing him in. \c) By their Gulf policy'they tried to make him dependent commercially on Koweit and Bahrein.W hereas a friend in need of help looked to a more powerful friend to assist him, he had had no help from His Majesty’s Government. Look what His Majesty’s Government had done for Egypt and Iraq ! Those countries might be richer than Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia could, in his opinion, be more useful than either to His Majesty’s Government. 11. After expressing great interest in the valuable historical survey which the King had given, but pointing out that what we had to adopt as a basis was the facts of to-day, Mr. Kendel suggested that one difficulty was that, whereas countries like Egypt and Iraq, which contained rich natural resources, could be developed by commercial enterprises which would earn their own profits, Saudi Arabia did not at present appear to be economically in that category. If, how ever, Ibn Saud had any particular kind of help in mind and would specify what it was, he could be sure that the suggestion would be considered very carefully. Ibn Saud said that there were all sorts of help that he might mention, but he would speak first of aviation, to which he attached great importance. He had sent to His Majesty’s Minister through t£ that man ” (pointing to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin) a suggestion about the training of Saudis in aviation in Great Britain. As to the Italians, he swore as a Moslem and an Arab that when the Italian aeroplanes arrived, he wished that Allah would destroy the machines and the men in them. Mr. Rendel reminded the King that the failure of other countries to follow our example in reducing armaments had compelled us to rearm, and that the expansion of the British air force was employing to the full all our resources for the manufacture of aeroplanes and the training of men as pilots and mechanics, and that, while this should tend to deter other nations from disturbing the peace of the world and should therefore be of advantage to His Majesty, it made it more difficult than it would otherwise have been to give His Majesty direct assistance in matters of aviation. Nevertheless, if His Majesty would make specific suggestions, they would be examined most carefully and sympathetically. 12. The subject was again referred to at a later meeting the same day. Mr. Rendel repeated his warning about the peculiar difficulties created by the pre occupation of His Majesty’s Government with their scheme of rearmament, and spdke of the necessity for co-ordination of skilled men with suitable machines if time and money spent on training and equipment were not to be wasted, and of the possibility that Saudi Arabia, having a very small urban population among which to find men with a suitable preliminary training in mechanical work, &amp;c., might find it more difficult than, e.g., Egypt, to produce suitable candidates for aviation work. Sir Reader Bullard suggested that, whereas it might suit the Italians to undertake the training of any number of Saudis because of the political effect it might be expected to have, His Majesty’s Government would be reluctant to embark on any scheme that would not have a reasonable chance of success. He also asked the King what His Majesty thought would be the effect upon the Italians of any close relationship between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia in matters of aviation. Was there any reason to think that this might encourage them to seek to extend their influence elsewhere, e.g., in the Yemen ? It was true that the Italians had themselves wished to identify themselves closely with Saudi Arabia in aviation affairs, but how far was that merely a phase of the war with Ethiopia and their hostility to His Majesty’s Government on that point? The King said that the Italians still wished to be allowed to develop Saudi aviation, and implied that he didn’t care what they thought. He added bitterly that the pilots trained in Italy were no good. At one point in the con versation the King said that if Iraq shook itself free of Turkish influence he would not mind having some Iraqis to help in aviation later on. 13. It was arranged that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin should prepare for His Majesty’s Minister a note of the Saudi requirements in aviation matters. This note, Ibn Saud was assured, would receive the most careful attention. Third Interview, March 21. 14. The King said that he wanted to speak about his future in relation to His Majesty’s Government. He began with a long and rather pointless account of the negotiations for the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. In so far as it had a point it was intended to show the Iraqis as rather slippery customers. At Riyadh, said the King, Naji-al-Asil suggested to Ibn Saud thatmmm 9 6 Iraq should deal with His Majesty’s Government in the matter of Palestine on behalf of Ibn Sand, and that Ibn Sand should deal with the Imam about his adhesion to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. Ibn Baud had expressed surprise at this request, and had said that both States must act together in both matters. He spoke of what appeared to be a similar attempt to side-track him in the matter of securing the adhesion of the Imam to the treaty. He then spoke of the surprise he t had felt at the Iraqis wanting to insert in the treaty a reference to the League of Nations, of which Saudi Arabia was not a member, and added that the Imam would never consent to sign anything in which there was a reference to the League. Mr. Rendel explained that members of the League could not assume any obligation which might be incompatible with their existing obligations under the Covenant, and that they were therefore bound to make a reservation to that effect in any treaty involving military assistance, &amp;c. Moreover, Iraq was also bound by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, which, as His Majesty’s Government had pointed out to the Iraqi Government, involved a similar reservation on the part of Iraq. Mr. Rendel said that, of course, such a reservation would not affect a party not a member of the League, and that consequently neither Saudi Arabia nor the Yemen would be affected by such a reservation on the part of Iraq. 15. The King then said that he had often been asked whether the Arab States of the Persian Gulf could not adhere to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. He had fended off such enquiries, alleging the unimportance of such States, but he would be glad to know the opinion of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel reminded His Majesty of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Gulf. They had had relations with the Arab rulers there in some cases for as long as a century and a half, having been compelled to take action in regard to gun-running, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c. As a result, as had been made clear at the time of the Treaty of Jedda, the foreign affairs of Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms were in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, who exercised sovereignty over them in those affairs and therefore could not allow them to enter into treaty relations with any foreign State. Ibn Sand seemed to accept this statement without demur. 16. This subject led to the question of the frontiers. Mr. Rendel repeated the arguments which he used with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 19th March, saying that His Majesty’s Government had made great concessions in this respect, whereas His Majesty was holding firmly to his original demand. In the northern part of the eastern frontier there remained nothing between the parties but the Jabal Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid with perhaps an adjustment in the Sufuk (Safaq) region that might go some way towards meeting the King’s wishes. Could not His Majesty make some concession here? It would make an excellent impression on the Foreign Office if he could. Ibn Saud repeated his familiar statement that the whole of the coast belonged to his ancestors and that the present rulers would not deny it. Koweit, for instance; all the tribes living in Koweit were really Saudi tribes. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty’s Government in the Hadda Agreement^ 1 ) but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik, which was in the nufud. 17. The maps which were at hand were examined, but Araik was not marked on them. Sir Reader Bullard said that he had seen a map on which, unless his memory was at fault, Araik was shown to the south of Jabal Naksh In that case there would no longer be any disagreement on that point. 18. As to Khor-el-Odeid, Ibn Saud said that, in claiming it for Saudi Arabia, he was thinking of the interests of His-Majesty’s Government as much as of his own, for no one but himself could keep order there. When crimes were committed there it was to him that the people applied for redress. 19. The King seemed very anxious to pass on to another subject. It appeared at first that he was wanting to evade the boundary question, but when the other subject came to be broached it was found to be a question of capital importance. What, the King asked, would happen to him in the case of war? Suppose war began in Europe, or in the Yemen, or anywhere? Could not His Majesty’s Government make some treaty or some other lesser undertaking with him ? It could be secret if they wished. 20. Mr. Rendel said that any such undertaking, and more especially any kind of secret guarantee, was precluded by the British constitutional system. ( 1 ) This reference should be to Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda. a o S' 0 ( ]7 which would in any case make its eventual fulfilment uncertain. Sir R. Bullard added that His Majesty’s Government were obliged, as members of the League of Nations, to register all treaties with the League. Mr. Rendel then went on to say, as he had said the previous day, that he could hardly imagine any occasion on which a threat to Saudi Arabia would not be a threat to His Majesty’s Government, and added that this community of interests was a stronger bond than many a treaty. We had given too many promises in the past, under pressure of war in particular, and could not give one in this case. Sir Reader Bullard reminded the King once more of the terms of the Rome Agreement of 1927. His Majesty’s Government had recorded in writing that they regarded it as a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” The King seemed to derive comfort from this conversation. Fourth Interview, March 22. 21. The King said that in this the last conversation before Mr. Rendel’s departure he wished to speak about Palestine. The Arabs were now really alarmed by the Zionist policy. They feared that a Jewish Government would be established in Palestine and would include Transjordan in its scope, and they were even beginning to fear that there might be designs on Medina itself, the burial-place of the Prophet Mahomet. Some of these fears might be exaggerated, and due to irresponsible talk by individual Jews, but there was also genuine ground for apprehension, and he himself was very anxious about the question. Great Britain was powerful and could crush the Arab opposition, but he feared that there might be dangerous repercussions in other Moslem countries in which His Majesty’s Government had special interests, e.g., Egypt, Iraq and India. There were many enemies watching for an opportunity to injure Great Britain. The chief of these was, of course, Italy. The attempt that Italy was making to win recognition as the friend of Moslems in general and of the Arabs in particular was well known. The Italians had used the pilgrimage for propa ganda purposes, and had done their best to induce him to speak in praise of their pro-Moslem policy. He had resisted this attempt, and he had no belief whatever in Italian professions, for he knew what had happened in Tripoli and in Abyssinia, but there was a real danger from the Italians, nevertheless, if the troubles in Palestine should flare up again. Nor were the Turks inactive. They had many agents in Palestine, who never failed to rub it into the Arabs that the result of their revolt against the Turks was subordination to the Jews. The Zionist policy, as it was being carried out at present, was contrary to British interests, and that was one reason why he was against it. As a Moslem and an Arab he naturally sympathised with the Arabs of Palestine. He had suppressed these personal feelings hitherto out of friendship for His Majesty’s Government, and he could always suppress his feelings if policy required it. But the Zionist policy was not even in the interests of Great Britain. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government must realise that he stood alone, and that he had to think of his position in a Moslem world where he was the butt of much criticism, and where many of his co-religionists would not even admit that he was a Moslem. He felt that he had come to the end of what he could do in the matter of Palestine. 22. His Majesty was assured that his views would be communicated to His Majesty’s Government without delay. 23. Ibn Baud said that he had one last question. Suppose that there was trouble in the Yemen and the Italians asked him about it, as they might very well do; what should he say? Should he reply to this effect:— He did not propose to interfere in the internal affairs of the Yemen, and the Rome understanding of 1927, the relevant part of which had been communicated to him by the Italians as well as by the British, seemed to require them both to adopt a similar attitude of non-intervention. Mr. Rendel said that this reply seemed to meet the circumstances exactly.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY of HIS ^RITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT L EASTERN (Arabia).

I had said that a map in our possession showed Araik as between Qasr-as-Salwa and Jabal Naksh, and had asked whether His Majesty’s definition did not leave Jabal Naksh to Qatar, but Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s letter does not admit my contention, and implies that there is another Araik (Uraiq) between Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh.

R W. BULLARD. Enclosure 1. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Sir R. Bullard. (Translation.) Dear Sir Reader Bullard, • J edda, March 23, 1937. THE moment I received your Excellency’s letter of the 23rd March, 1937, I hastened to put right the point which your Excellency raised. In the interview I had in haste with your Excellency at your house just before noon on Tuesday, the 10th Muharram (22nd March, 1937), I explained to you that I did not believe that His Majesty the King, in his conversation to which you referred, meant A1 Ureyq but Dukhan. There was a slip of the tongue. After I left your Excellency I enquired of His Majesty concerning the actual fact, and His Majesty stated that he did not intend that place, which is south of Naksh, but the one which is south of Dukhan, which makes Naksh within the Saudi Arab Kingdom. During the conversation His Majesty did not think of giving up the claim concerning the frontiers put forward by the Government of His Majesty. His Majesty’s statement was accidental and did not concern the details of the case. The question was not one of discussing the exact position of the frontiers, and I therefore think the question still stands where it did. With highest respects, YUSUF YASIN. [981 t—3]Enclosure 2. ]\!ote by Ibn Saud am'plifying his Statements about \his Position in regard to the Arab Rulers on the Persian Gidf. (Translation.) I HAVE spoken clearly about the historical stages in the relations between me and the British Government, all of which have been courteous and consistently amicable on my part, and sometimes on the part of the British. But what filled me with misgiving, much annoyed me and affected my honour are the two following points : — (1) The question of the frontiers of Qatar, Oman and other principalities of the Gulf. (2) The question of trade and marine transport. As regards the first point, these territories themselves, as you are aware, were under the suzerainty of my ancestors, and until the time of my grandfather, Faisal, paid an annual tax for the preservation of the relationship of vassal to overlord. But in view of our desire for the continuation of our friendship with the British Government and the said Amirs to whom we are bound by old ties, we have recognised their positions in the Persian Gulf and their principalities, and have respected the treaties between them and the British Government. But it never entered my head that this could be a reason for taking away a part of our territories and annexing it to those territories at a time when every one admits that the peace which those places enjoy is due to God and to us. It is not reasonable that such pressure should be due to suspicion of us or to doubt as to our intentions or our friendship, or to the accusation that we covet a territory which is ours. For the covetous man does not covet a mountain or an inlet; he covets rather a densely populated country. What we care for is the protection of our honour and the defence of the rights of our subjects and tribes. As to the question of trade, I know that ships call at, and carry goods and all kinds of merchandise to, ports on the Persian Gulf which are less important than mine, and I who count myself the oldest friend of Britain and the greatest of the Arabs am placed at the mercy of Koweit or Bahrain; and whenever the question is raised, it is said that it is one for the shipping companies. I did not believe that friends could treat each other in such a cruel manner. Praise be to God who granted me and my country more power than that of Koweit, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, &amp;c. Why should ships call at those places and mine suffer deprivation in that no ships call there ? I hope you will, as you have stated, consider the situation as it is and a veil will be drawn over the past if its mistakes can thus be corrected. Otherwise you may inform me of the real reasons. I have summarised in this letter what I have told you at length in my conversation.

[E 1960/92/25] Copy No. Mr. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received April 12.) (No. 40.) Sir, Jedda, March 23, 1937. Mr. RENDEL’S tour in the Near and Middle East brought him to Jedda on the 17th March, a few days after Ibn Sand’s first appearance in Jedda since my arrival at this post last September, and when I presented Mr. Rendel to him I had myself only seen him once, a few days before, and that only for a short call such as was paid by all the foreign representatives in Jedda. It was to be expected that Ibn Saud would wish to use this opportunity to speak of various matters affecting the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia, and after we had had two meetings on current questions with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba we were invited to call on His Majesty for a conversation on matters of mutual interest. This resulted in three meetings lasting some two hours or more each, and a fourth which might have lasted as long had not Mr. Rendel been obliged to leave to catch his steamer for Egypt. 2. Fuad Bey had left Jedda unexpectedly a few days before Mr. RendeTs arrival. The alleged reason for his departure at a moment when the presence of the Deputy Foreign Minister might have been regarded as essential was the health of his little boy, about whom he professed to be exceedingly anxious, but information from other quarters does not bear out the plea that the child was seriously ill, and it may be that his jealousy of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Minister in London, who would naturally be present at any interviews accorded to Mr. Rendel, made him glad to leave, and that the King, who perhaps does not trust him fully, was glad to let him take a holiday. During one of our conversations the King mentioned with emphasis as the three men he trusted Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and his son Faisal, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Amir joined the group on two occasions, the other two were present throughout. From statements made during the conversations, I am forced to conclude that I have been misled by Fuad Bey on one or two points, and for this reason, and also because of the general pro-Italian reputation which he has acquired, it is impossible to believe that conversations such as we had could have been as full and as frank had Fuad Bey been present. 3. The lavish hospitality which Ibn Saud always displays to guests threatened to assume an alarmingly public character in Jedda. We were embarrassed to discover that not only were dinners to Mr. Rendel to be given by the King and the Amir Faisal—festivities which might be taken as a reasonable return for hospitality enjoyed by the Amirs Saud and Faisal in England—-but a dinner was to be given by Sheikh Abdallah Sulaiman, the Minister of Finance. At our request the third dinner was cancelled, but it was replaced by a tea-party, which was attended by the King. The personal character of the party was, however, emphasised by the presence of Mrs. Rendel. The King made a very rare exception to his rule not to receive European ladies, and had her placed m the seat of honour on his right. 4. Not only did we endeavour to avoid some of the external signs ot an official visit, but Mr. Rendel was careful to explain, both at the beginning of his visit to Jedda and also just before his departure, that his journey was personal and private. It was undertaken, he explained, in response to the generous invitation of His Highness the Amir Saud. Nevertheless, he had taken the opportunity to study carefully on the spot various mattei s affecting Aaiglo-Saudi relations, in particular the Qatar boundary, and he would be glad if he could assist in arriving at a settlement of this or of any other outstanding question. 5. At my urgent request Mr. Rendel took the leading part whenever there was a question of explaining the point of view of His Majesty’s Government on matters of importance. This was not only reasonable in that he was merely going again over ground covered on many occasions with the Saudi representativein London, but there was the even more cogent reason that Ibn Sand would certainly expect to hear the views of an official of the Foreign Office who, to his knowledge, had dealt with Saudi affairs for many years. I venture to believe that Mr. Rendel’s visit and the conversations to which it gave rise have been of the greatest value, and will have helped to launch my personal relations with His Majesty under the happiest auspices. Certainly nothing could have been ^ more cordial, friendly and familiar than the King’s words and manner, which never changed, however delicate the point under discussion, and it was interesting to learn from my new Italian colleague, with our interviews fresh in my mind, that he had found the King extremely guarded, and concluded that he was an extremely clever fellow, who would never commit himself. 6. I am fully conscious of the danger that excessive cordiality at the beginning of an acquaintance may lead to disappointment later on. As I informed the Foreign Office in personal letters soon after my arrival, I found that the King regarded me, on the strength of quite normal official letters written by me to King Hussein in 1923-25 and discovered in the Shereefian archives after the fall of Jedda, as a partisan of Ibn Sand’s, and I regretted this assumption, since the oriental builds far too much upon personalities and the King might expect to gain impossible favours from His Majesty's Government through my efforts and might afterwards be more dissatisfied at failure than if he had never entertained any hope of success. Similarly there is the danger that he may build too much upon Mr. Rendel’s visit, and may hope to influence His Majesty’s Government in matters where it is not possible for them to make concessions or grant favours. But it is sufficient to keep this danger in mind. On the whole I am sure that the cordial conversations have been of very great value. 7. The subjects discussed during Mr. Rendel's visit were these :— (1) With Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba :— (a) Qatar frontier. (b) Transjordan frontier. (c) Koweit blockade. (2) With the King, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba being present:— (a) W W (e) (/) The general relations of Saudi Arabia with His Majesty’s Govern ment (this includes the Qatar frontier and relations with the Persian Gulf rulers in general). Relations of Saudi Arabia with Italy. The Yemen (with the Italians in the background). Iraq (with the Turks in the background). An appeal for assistance from His Majesty’s Government (not dealt with in detail except to some extent in regard to aviation). Palestine^ These questions, which frequently overlapped each other in the course of the conversations, will be dealt with in detail by telegram or despatch. 8.

IN the summary of conversations with Ibn Saud which I had the honour to submit as an enclosure to my despatch No. 41, dated the 23rd March, the question of the Yemen was referred to in paragraphs 3. 4, 5 and 23. I now transmit a summary of the document which the King handed to me when we were dealing with this subject. The document is a multigraphed copy of a typewritten original in Arabic, in the form of an open letter to the Imam. I understood from Ibn Saud that the letter had been distributed widely in the Yemen. It urges the Imam to designate his son Husain as his successor, instead of Ahmad, and to begin now to train Husain for the task of government. There is a pan-Arab touch in the request that two Moslems from Syria, Egypt or Iraq should sit on the Council of Notables whose formation is recommended. In so far as foreign interference is referred to, it appears that the British are placed on the same level as the Italians. 2. Ibn Saud spoke with great earnestness about the certainty that trouble must break out in the Yemen on the Imam’s death, if not before. The open letter assures the Imam that a revolt will break out before his honourable coffin has reached the cemetery. The open letter might be a piece of propaganda for Husain with nothing behind it, for all I could tell, for I have little direct knowledge about the Yemen, but Ibn Saud was doubtless telling the truth when he claimed to be very well informed. He referred to the Wazir family as being with the rest of the Yemen against Ahmad. It will be remembered that Muhammad-al-Wazir came on the pilgrimage this year. He shared to some extent in the honours paid to the three sons of the Imam by Ibn Saud. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo and Aden. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Summary of the Contents of an Open Letter addressed to the Imam Yahya and signed “The Loyal Tongue of the Nation C I HE Imam’s rule has been partly good and partly bad, but his piety has caused, and still causes, his people to overlook the bad things and to be loyal to him and to his house. However, times are changing and men with them, so he would be well advised to listen to frankly uttered counsels. He wishes his son Ahmad to succeed him. Such a succession would be disastrous, for Ahmad is incapable of governing; in such an event the people would be dissatished, and, on the death of the Imam Yahya, they would rise in armed revolt. The agreements entered into with England and Italy, with a view to strengthening Ahmad’s position, would prove valueless. The writer then advises the Imam as follows :— (1) To consult the Amirs, Ministers and officials as to the man they consider a suitable successor to the Imamate. It does not follow, of course, that they will speak their minds freely. (2) To proclaim A1 Husain as his successor and initiate him, in the Imam’s lifetime, into the work of government with the assistance of a council of notables. Among the members of such a council should be two Moslem leaders or upright men from Syria, Egypt or Iraq. This would be welcome to the people who consider A1 Husain an honest and pious man, and would mean the frustration of foreign designs.(3) To persuade Ahmad to surrender his rights for the common weal and recompense him by giving him the Amirate of Hejah, with the revenues thereof, on condition that he takes his orders from the capital. (4) lo promote unity among his sons and send some of them to Egypt to be educated at A1 Azhar or some other institution, under the supervision of tutors appointed by him and by the Egyptian Government. Haste is urged in putting these suggestions into execution, and the Imam is told that his adherence to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty will strengthen the Yemen; thus there is no need to fear foreigners. The importance of his recognising A1 Husain during his lifetime is stressed once again, as is the importance of A1 Husain’s travelling in Egypt, Syria and Iraq in order that he may see how' foreign countries are ruled.SECRET.

It consists of an article in which the 'Saut al Hejaz' describes the Mufti of Palestine and his friends as ,J the Syrian leaders ' 1 &lt;&gt; and refers to their 'heroism' and 'sustained effort'. The word used for 'effort'? viz. jihad ? has also the technical meaning of religious war? and the title of 'Mujahid' which is bestowed by the 'Saut al liejaz' on Riyadh al Salh may mean not only one who strives but also a warrior in the cause of religion. Even the more restrained 'Umm al Qura' heads an otherwise colourless paragraph on the subjects 'Departure of the v mujahids v ? the leaders of Palestine and Syria'« 4o Copies of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to the Government of India?

The centre room was reserved for speakers? government officials? Hejazi personalities and well to do pilgrims? the inner portion of the building was reserved for pilgrims? while the Hejazi youths were seated in the yard on a raised platform. It is estimated that 600 attended the meetings Locally they say that the gathering was organised by themselves and funds provided for by subscription amongst themselves? but actually it was supported by the G-overnment who find it a good ground for 'propaganda .work. All the leading pilgrims were invited., At about 8 pom.p the building was full? when the principal guests began to arrive. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalemjcame first and was given a very warm reception. He was followed by Syed lobara of Yemen and two other Yemenis. Next came Mahmud Basyuni (President of the Egyptian Senate) accompanied by two Egyptians? he too received a warm welcome. Amongst the Hejazi personalities I have only seen Mahdi Bey? Abdul Wahab Shebi and Syed Salih Shata? the honorary president of the meeting* Muhammad Saroor was also present but was sitting v r ith the pilgrims* Mail ana. Ismail G-haznavi? Abdul Halim SiddiqpL and other Indians were also present. The place was overcrowded with people? many of whom came not for the sake of hearing the speeches as much as for the sake of fun and killing ±±mk the time* The weather was cold and. thejpoor youths who were all seated in the yard were bitterly feeling it? and some of them wanted to run away but the chairs were so irregularly placed that one had simply to stay where he was* As guests came in they were given a printed programme of what is going to take place. When the above speech was over His Excellency Mahmud Basyuni v r as asked by the Hejazi youths to give 'Ghem^ some advice, He expressed his inability at first saying that he wao extremely tired and in a position that he could nob speak correctly. But when they insisted he began a long beginning with the Haj topic and gradually getting to ' &amp; ne economical side? at which he said that many Muslim coun rioo would be willing to help the Hejaz by accepting s undents _r .n this country to learn modern ways of agriculture and o^ber necessities' of modern life and said that Egypt would^be glad to feeip them. In the end, addressing the pilgrims h congratulated Syria and remarked saying As o ® t , allianc^e with Great Britain we too hope we shall and prcosper’b ~Then looking at Amin el Husseim he laughi ^ said'-iMwish Palestine the best of luck-. This was flowed'by shouts from all corners ’/God save Palestine from the Jews” and exchange of words 'between the pilgrims w Seeing this Basyuni laughingly said that they were there not to discuss politics? and then ended his speech and left regretting his ^ inability to stay longer as he was? and in fact he looked? very tired* Afterwards they requested the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to give tnem a fev r words but he w r as very firm in refusing saying that if he knew before that bhey wanted a speech from him he would have willingly accepted their request? but at that moment o But the youths went on last stood up and said he was unable to say anything at all requesting him for a few words he at ”1 thank you very much for insisting I have nothing to say at the moment? you since you did not give me a hint words he asked their leave to let him go? but they were not satisfied with his apologies and persisted to hear him say any thing o Whereupon he gave a very brief, talk on religion and gave them some advice? but he never touched any points on Palestine or even the Heria7.- and his aneenh to hear me? but I am sorry and the fault lies with beforehand”„ Saying these speech was just an ordinary oner He left amongst the cheers of all those present Later an Egyptian doctor? employed in the Saudi Government gave a speech? which was in favour and praise of Ibn Baud's Governmentc fie talked in length about an all Islamic League to be held every year in Mecca or Mina to fulfil the real aim for which Haj was meant* He pleaded all the pilgrims to look upon this country as theirs - the land which they face five A ..me s a ■’abia day for pra He said everybody should consider as his native land ’’There should be no question of nationality? we are all Muslims and we should love and sacrifice ourselves for the land of Islam before anything else.'

Bullard to Mr. Eden.-—(Received March 22.) (No. 33.) Sir, Jedda, March 4, 1937. ANT Moslems who expected that the pilgrimage would be made the occasion either for the holding of a Moslem congress or for some less formal demonstration of politico-religious solidarity will have been disappointed. In my telegram No. 11, which I had the honour to address to you on the 25th February, I conveyed a message from Ibn Saud, in which he stated that in reply to an appeal for help from the Mufti of Palestine he had advised the mufti to await the finding of the Royal Commission and to co-operate with the Palestine authorities in the maintenance of law and order. According to my information the mufti did not make any political speech throughout the pilgrimage, not even at the meeting of the Saudi xTrab Toung Men’s Society at Mima, at which he was a guest. The published report of this meeting represents the mufti as having been called upon for a speech after a long series of other persons had either made speeches or recited verses, and as having spoken on “ Islam and Modern Civilisation.” It would be quite easy to make a violent speech about Palestine which would fit this title, but I am assured that the speech was non-political. 2. It had been Ibn Sand’s custom for some years to give a dinner of about a thousand covers to the leading men from the* various countries represented at the pilgrimage. This year he gave four separate banquets for : (1) Indians; (2) Egyptians; (3) “pilgrims from the Arab countries”; and (4) “pilgrims from various countries.” The newspaper report mentions as among the “ various countries ’ ’ China, the Sudan, and North, South and East Africa. The Malays and Javanese are not mentioned, but it seems that, in fact, very few of these pilgrims attend the Royal banquets. It is alleged that they are not remunerative as guests, because they never make speeches praising Ibn Saud and do not write him up when they get back to their own countries. The reason given in the press for the division of the pilgrims into groups is that it gave the King an opportunity to get into closer touch with them. The innovation would clearly have that effect, but the splitting up of the pilgrims by countries would also make it more difficult foi a hot headed speaker to make a pan-Islamic appeal, and this consideration may have helped to influence Ibn Sand’s decision. 3. A striking feature of the pilgrimage was Ibn Saud’s endeavour to convince the Moslem world of his orthodoxy. According to the published version of the speech which he delivered at the Indian banquet, after speaking as he has done every year about Allah and the Prophet and the Koran he said “ As to the prescriptions of the sects, we are not against them in anything. They are all our sects, whether Hanafi, or Shafai, or Maliki or Hanbah. Our sect is based on proof wherever it may be found \i.e in the Koran or the traditions of the Prophet], and if proof is lacking and there is nothing to follow but ijtihad [deduction or interpretation by a person of learning], then we follow the ‘ ijtihad ’ of Ahmad-bin-Hanbal.” A similar statement was made by the King in the course of a private interview whmh he gave to His Highness the Khan of Kelat. According to Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, the Indian vice-consul, who was present, the King declared that he was a Hanbali, but that he respected the other three founders of the Sunni sects and had adopted various points from their teachings. It does not appear from the published leports that the King made similar declarations on any other occasion, but the publication in the Umm-al-Qura of the declaration made at the Indian banquet shows that it was not intended merely for Indian consumption [956 y—4]'J 4. Ibn Sand’s interest in the pilgrimage, which is none the less sincerely religious for being necessarily financial, must itself dispose him to be conciliatory towards Moslems who might question his orthodoxy. This year, however, he may have wished to give a particularly marked religious turn to his public utterances because of the attempts which he knew were being made to make political capital out of the pilgrimage. He had to deal not only with the Mufti of Palestine, but also with the pilgrims subsidised by General Franco and by the Italian authorities, about whom I am reporting separately. 5.

Section 2, 2^ E 6851/131/5$] Copy No. 120 (No. 283.) Sir, Sir R. Bullard to Mr. iSovember 2.) Jedda, October 11, 1936. I HAVE the honour to report that, after the exchange of notes on the 3rd October, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin asked whether he could see me about certain other questions, and it was arranged that he should call at the Legation on the 5th October. He had already asked whether I wished to continue the discussion of the Koweit and frontier questions or would prefer to await the return of Fuad Bey Hamza, which was expected to occur very soon, and I told him that the Saudi counter-draft of article 1 of the proposed Koweit regulations against smuggling was being considered by His Majesty’s Government, and that, as to the other matters, it would perhaps be well for me to wait until Fuad Bey’s return, since I was new to the post, and needed as much time as possible to make myself fully acquainted with the relevant files. Sheikh Yusuf had made no objection to this, and had concluded that all questions of major interest were therefore in abeyance, and that on the 5th October he would discuss minor questions at issue, such as the blacklisting of certain pilgrim guides. He, however, embarked upon a long statement on foreign affairs, which, he said, he had been charged to make by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. He spoke very carefully, hesitating from time to time, as though to recall Ibn Sand’s exact words. The statement, however, was so clearly, in its more important parts, only a repetition of many statements made to the Legation during the Ethiopian dispute, that it has been possible to cut down to a page or so the summary which I attach to the present despatch. 2. In reply, I said that Sheikh Yusuf must not expect a detailed answer. I was new to the post, and I had not been warned what he proposed to talk about. (I might have reminded him that when he asked for a meeting I had enquired whether he wished to speak of anything of great importance, so that I might be prepared, and that he had waved this aside.) As to Palestine, I was happy to say that, when I was received by Mr. Eden after my appointment, he authorised me to convey to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz his 'personal thanks for the help offered in connexion with the Palestine dispute. On all other points except one my remarks were purely conventional. The exception was Italy, though even on this point I confined myself to generalities. I said that it was clearly impossible for me to go beyond statements made to the Saudi Government by Sir Andrew Ryan, acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government. For myself, I would suggest that the Saudi Government should take a long view and not think only of the Ethiopian question, which had been complicated by the fact that the whole world was trying to find a solution by hitherto untried' methods. The Saudi attitude towards the Italian offer of money and arms was presumably prompted by a desire to maintain their independence, an aim which must have the fullest sympathy of His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty would do well to look again at the Rome understanding of 1927. It was not usual to give such assurances as the Saudi Arab Government had wished to receive. What would happen would depend on world affairs, on a host of circumstances. The King had at least one solid fact to go upon—the long experience of His Majesty’s Government to which Sheikh Yusuf had referred with appreciation. I stated that what Sheikh Yusuf had said would be reported to the Foreign Office, and I concluded with suitable thanks for the assurances of friendship, and with similar assurances on our own part. 3. Since the meeting which I have described, I have read with great attention all the papers relating to the attempt made by Ibn Saud a few months ago to obtain from His Majesty’s Government assurances that they would assist him if he should be threatened by the Italians. It is difficult to see what Ibn Saud expects to gain by raising this point again, when it has been dealt with [856 b—2]2 r so fully and so many times by my predecessor, acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government. But I did not gather that Ibn Saud was really expecting a more favourable reply, but only that he was stating his position. Perhaps he felt that it was the proper thing to do, on the appointment of a new British Minister, to give a summary of his foreign policy as it affects His Majesty’s Government. And then the oriental always attaches importance to individuals, s and hopes thatJB will get him better terms than were offered by B’s predecessor, A. v 4. I imagine that you will wish me to express my thanks forAhe assurances 'of friendship, and perhaps your particular pleasure, at Ibn Baud’s remembering occasions beforo the war when the support of His Majesty’s Government was of assistance to him. and to say, with regard to the references made by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Italy, t^iat Sir Andrew Ryan went into this question so fully and explained so'clearly th^ attitude of His Majesty’s Government that I am unable to add anything to what he said. I await your instructions. •« . v.. i I have. &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Br'ief Summary of a Statement made by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to His Majesty’s Minister on October 5, 1936. FRIENDSHIP with His Majesty’s Government had long been the basis of Ibn Sand’s foreign policy. Fie had been in relations with them since the early days of his career and was grateful for their support. In particular, he was grateful for the help they gave him at a moment when the Turks were about to attack him. They asked the Turks to give them a few months’ notice before the beginning of hostilities, so that British subjects and their property might be removed from Nejd, and, in the interval, he was able to come to terms with the Turks. Ibn Saud now saw danger in three quarters : near, farther off, and remote, viz., Italy, Turkey and Germany. (N.B.—Germany was not mentioned again.) The Italians had been the last to recognise Saudi Arabia, and their conduct in regard to Asir and the Yemen had been very suspicious, but at the time of the Ethiopian dispute there had been a complete revolution in their policy towards Saudi Arabia. Italy had recently wished to give Ibn Saud arms and munitions to the value of perhaps £1 million. He had not wanted to accept, but, to avoid giving offence, he had accepted a few aeroplanes. He had informed Sir Andrew Ryan, and had asked whether His Majesty’s Government could give him assurances. He regretted that they had not been able to do more than refer him to the Rome understanding of 1927. The Turks were ancient enemies of the Arabs, and resented the rise to independence and importance of people whom they regarded as savages. It was fear of the Turks that had impelled him to initiate the negotiations that had ended with the treaty with Iraq. (Here Sheikh Yusuf Yasin made a brief but very cordial reference to Iraq.) Difficulties with Transjordan arose from time to time (Sheikh Yusuf hinted that these were due to the incurable levity of character of the Amir Abdullah), but Ibn Saud did not want trouble there. He had always been conciliatory, and he trusted that with the help of His Majesty’s Government such difficulties as arose would always be settled satisfactorily. As to Syria, Ibn Saud had made a point of keeping on good terms with the French. In regard to Palestine, Ibn Saud had no other aim than to see peace re-established between two parties, both of whom were his friends.

In conversation on December 26th Fuad Bey who had just returned from Riyadh represented Ibn Sand as having said to him that never before had his relations with His Majesty’s Government been on so satisfactory a basis. Language was in any case vague but clearly meant to be very friendly. According to Fuad, Ibn Saud seems to think that his attitude over Palestine has convinced His Majesty's Government of his sincerity and desire to help. On the other hand Fuad appeared to imply that Ibn Saud had deserved well of His Majesty's Government and had more than repaid concessions made to him in regard to treaty of Jedda. All this was background to frontier discussion (see my immediately following telegram) which made no advance \COPY. (E 6852/131/25) No. 284. (1771/430/154) British Legation, Jedda. 12 th October 1936. Sir, As I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No, 116 dated 10th October, the 'Umm-al-Qura' published the preceding day a full suranary of all the points in the Anglo-Saudi agreement embodied in the recent exchange of notes, viz., the ,, extension ,, of the Treaty of Jedda, the manner of dealing with the effects of British pilgrims, the recognition of the Arabic text of the Treaty as of equal value with the English, the reservation of rights on both sides in regard to Aqaba and Ma ! an, the renunciation of the right of manumission by His Majesty's Government and the conditions governing the purchase of arms in Great Britain by the Saudi Arab Government. The official notice concludes with the promise to publish the full text of the notes at the earliest possible opportunity. 2. The same number of the 'Umm-al-Qura 1 ' contains a leading article, a brief summary of which is enclosed. The chief points of interest are the careful disclaimer that the relations of Saudi Arabia with His Majesty's Government differ from those with any other Government and the reference to pan-Moslem and pan-Arab aims in the last paragraph. The curious sentence which I have translated literally and placed in inverted commas should not be taken too seriously. Those who know Sheykh Yusuf Yasin/ The Eight Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P. etc., etc., etc•Yasin 'better than I do recognise his niggling pen in the qualification 'from time to time'. Let us hope that if he had any clear conception in his mind he meant that the friendly relations between the two governments flared up 'from time to time' into something stronger, as on the present occasion. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department), Cairo and Bagdad. I have, etc. (Signed) R.W. Bullard.SU MMARY of an article in the n Umm-al-Qura u of Octp-be r 9th, 1956 . (After congratulations to both sides for the efforts made to promote friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and Great Britain). Those who have followed the foreign policy of His Majesty the King and of his Government will have observed the wise attitude he has adopted not only towards Great Britain but towards all the governments of the world. Since he ascended the throne, he and his government have always striven to strengthen the bonds of friendship with all other governments, adopting a peaceful attitude and showing themselves ready to shake hands with all. This policy has earned praise both at home and abroad. Peace and stability are the goal of the government as they are the aim of the people. It is not necessary to dwell on the importance of the results attained by our government in regard to the modifications of the Treaty of Jedda, since every reader can realise that for himself. 'As a whole they show the good xeeling which from time to time animates the friendly relations between the government of this country and the British Government”. , We wish continued success to our government in the wise policy which it has adopted in the interests of Islam in general ana of the Arabs in particular - and more especially lor the benefit of the people of this country.T 0 DISTRIBUTION.

This procedure, which reduces to a minimum interval between second and third steps is in accordance with original proposals of His majesty's Government (your telegram No. 42 of April 3rd). Last paragraph of your abovelentioned despatch. I shall send i ? with] confidential note a letter saying that my signa ture to final note will be affixed on the understanding that slaves on hand at the moment of signature will be dealt with under the old arrangement. Only Ibn Gaud could give assurances on this point and he is apparently away in the desert, but given iay letter and personal views expressed by Yusuf Yasin I do not anticipate trouble about current cases.

My dear Gaaelee, Many thanks for your letter of January 13th about my record of British consular officers in Jedda. When at home in 1934, I collected a certain amount of further information hut constant preoccupations throughout 1935 prevented me from revising my record. I have now completed it to the heat of my ability and enclose three copies. I should be grateful, if one of them might be sent to the India Office, provided you see no objection. I may draw attention to the following two points (a) It would be of interest here as a matter of local record to have short particulars of the commercial treaty, which Sir Home Popham seems to have negotiated with local Arabs in the neighbourhood of Jedda in 1800-3. (b) I am rather puzzled about the Col. Campbell, mentioned in the account of the new arrangements made in 1837-38. I think he is described in some papers as Agent and Consul General in Egypt. In another, of which I have a copy under my hand, dated November 13th, 1837, the Court of Directors of the East India Company said ”We have appointed Col. Campbell, Her Majesty’s Consul in Sir Stephen Gaselee, K.C.M.G., Foreign Office. Egypt3gypt our Ag^nt in that country” He does not, however, appear under either Alexandria or Cairo in the lists of past consuls on pp. 489 and 492 of the Foreign Office List for 1935.

I saw Yusuf Yasin again yesterday. Contrary to expectations founded on Fuad’s recent attitude 5 the King now seems anxious to get on with negotiations. 2. Yusuf Yasin suggested on April 23rd that the hest way of overcoming the difficulty in regard to the interval between the issue of slave regulations and the renunciation by His Mahesty’s Government (?of) right of manumission would be to reduce this interval to a minimum. after discussion he suggested action on three consecutive days as follows: (A) exchange of confidential Notes about (grp (C) exchange of . &gt; omtd.) (B) Promulgation of slavery regulations iotes about prolongation of Treaty. 3. I pointed out that this would delay the whole series of transactions until you had approved the draft Notes about the Treaty and that as the nature of the deal would be obvious it would defeat Fuad's original suggestion that the promulgation of the regulations should appear publicly to be the spontaneous act of the King, to be followed after an interval by the renunciation of the right of manumission. This might be to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government who would be freer to reveal the true nature of the transactions and might have to do so in Karllament, would it however suit Saudi Arabian Government?4. This gave Yusuf Yasin xo pau^e, but he confirmed the suggestion yesterday under instructions from the King. He added that the latter did not mind vvhat comments might be made. 5. I see no objection to the suggestion, which presents the advantage mentioned above, and will allow time for the other negotiations to proceed. May I accept it? 6. Saudi Arabian Government have abandoned request for assurance regarding arms traffic and have proposed to state simply (?to) firms that purchase will be governed by the regulations in force at time of purchase, I propose to agree to this subject to the modification that the regulations must be those in force at the time of exportation. Do you approve? 7. Yusuf Yasin is staying on here and we are proceeding with the drafts of the new exchange of Notes. I also explained yesterday the position as regards the Transjordan-Nejd frontier, and undertook to write personal letter stating the origin and nature of His Majesty's Government's latest proposal. I will report separately on this subject in due course and will keep the High Commissioner informed. 8. In view of the apparent change of outlook, I now propose to endeavour to complete negotiations on the above subjects and on the Koweit blockade when I receive further material from the folitical Agent. My aim would be to settle them in principle if possible before I leave, though still without making any one settlement depend on others. I will not lose sight of the question of the eastern frontier, but have little hope of substantial progress. I think it better to continue to leave the question of air facilities in abeyance for the present, and may have to leave this for (?Mr. Calvert) or even my successor, I will recall Yusuf Yasin's attention definitely to the pecuniary claim of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India (see your despatch No. 'S&amp;^but I do not think this should be pressed hard in the present circumstances. 9.

If this view is correct it will be somewhat disappointing but I think that His Majesty's Government can view the situation with equanimity now that they have made reasonable proposals regarding Eastern and South- Eastern frontiers and have shown the utmost goodwill in regard to Treaty of Jedda and connected questions besides showing readiness to deal with the ratified Nejd frontier in an accom modating spirit. 5. I propose therefore if you approve to show willingness to continue conversations with Sheriff Yusuf Yasin whom I shall see in the next few days but not to press them unduly even though this may mean that nothing (with possible exception of Koweit blockade) can be settled before I leave Jedda for good.NO DISTRIBUTION Decypher.

My chances oi se ttlmg anything with him before that date are still further diminished by somewhat severe indisposition which has incapacitated me since April 2nd and will probably last some days longer.

We agreed to discuss majority of outstanding questions beginning with the of Jedda and connected subjects. Ne intimated his agree ment with my proposal for further modifications of slavery regulations. 2. Fuad raised one important point. He agreed that formal renunciation of right of manumission could best be embodied in exchange of notes regarding prolongation of treaty but pointed out that this exchange might possibly be delayed for reasons unconnected with slavery settlement. He suggested that I should agree in confidential exchange of notes about slavery regulations t^ cease to exercise the right of manumission as soon as regula tions are published. I observed that it might be difficult to refuse asylum to slaves seeking manumission before His Majesty\s Government had formally renounced their right. Fuad suggested that any case arising during the interim period should be dis posed of by friendly arrangement as in certain cases of Royal % slaves in the past. 5. Once arms traffic formula is agreed to there is no reason to anticipahe serious delay over exchange of rotes regarding pro longation of treaty but there is some force in Fuad's contention as it may take time to reduce drafts to final form approved by.......2. approved by daiidl. Arabia. I propose therefore to acquiesce in FuadVs suggestion provided we agree on arms traffic formula before we proceed to exchange confidential notes regarding slavery and that he agrees to insertion of express provision in my confidential undertaking that slaves taking refuge between date of promulgation of regulations and exchange of notes about treaty 'will not be turned away but will be reported to Saudi Arabian Government with a view to their being given benefit of regulations. Do you approve? 4. I am making preliminary draft of British contribution to exchange of notes about treaty. I find that in recent correspon dence I have overlooked points 5 and 4 in enclosure to my despatch No. 113 of last year. I presume Thoap’Sen 1 3 objection j-e- to inserting provision regarding pilgrims' effects and to pressing mamtainance of Saudi reservation regarding Akaba Moss, region. I do not propose to touch on letters numbers 7 and 8 attached to treaty as latter though unsatisfactory has not caused practical difficulty. 5. I should like to reach agreement with Fuad regarding exchange of notes before he leaves about two weeks hence subject to our drafts being then submitted for your approval. I am not losing sight of other outstanding questions but have little hope of settling them except possibly Koweit question to which I propose to revert as soon as possible after I receive further report 1 H U promised in Political Agent's telegram No. 77 to Political Resident.U. 170o/131/2oj.

I realise that I cannot expect instructions on ques tion of Mastern frontier until some days after meeting fore- shadawed in your telegram No. 17 and I have so informed Fuad, It is not so easy to answer his frequent (7 enquiries) about the position in regard to slavery negotiations. Although most friendly in telephonic conversations he has continued to present the appearance (see my telegram No. 20) of avoiding interviews with me. Owing to the embarrassment mentioned above I have followed suit and have not seen him since 5rd February, 5. This situation is attended by the double inconvenience that it gives His Majesty's Government the appearance of un willingness to pursue negotiations even in regard to future treaty of Gedda and that I cannot use even such little influeiv as l otherwise might to keep Saudi-Arabian Government on sound linesas regards their attitude towards Italy. 4.

Section 4. [E 7573/3300/25] Sir A. Ryan to Sir Samuel Hoare.—{Received December 30.) (No. 349.) Sir, Jedda, December 9, 1935. SINCE I informed yon by my telegram No. 212 of the 3rd December of my return to Jedda, I have addressed to you a series of telegrams regarding my proceedings at Riyadh. I now have the honour to submit a summary account of my journey which may be useful for future reference^ 1 ) 2. I enclose a list( 1 ) of the stages of my journey, from which you will see that I adhered fairly closely to my original programme, but took one day longer than I had expected to get from Hufuf to Riyadh, and spent one extra night in the latter place. Captain de Gaury, who accompanied me all the way from Cairo, is preparing a further paper on the route across Arabia. 3. We were favoured most of the way by ideal weather conditions, i.e., sunshine following on recent rain, which had bound the soft ground in the sandy areas. Even so the road was somewhat trying, especially between Hufuf and Riyadh, between Ashaira and Sail, and most of the way from Sharay’a to Hadda, where non-Moslems have to follow a detour, now known as the Christians’ Road, to avoid Mecca. It is not too much to say that there is no such thing as a road at all in the European sense, but a practicable track and a track practicable only for the most intrepid drivers. The jolting was such that the wireless set, which I had brought as a present for Ibn Saud, arrived with so many parts broken as to be unusable. One bump more terrific than the rest, when we were crossing an ill-famed tract known as Umm Siqyan on the 21st November, damaged the muscles of my back so severely that I have not yet recovered the free use of them. 4. Our principal stopping places in the interior were Hufuf and Riyadh. All the arrangements in Hasa had been put in the hands of Sheikh Muhammad-at- Tawil, who carried them out with the utmost efficiency and courtesy. We were received on the evening of our arrival at Hufuf by the Amir Saud-bin-Abdullah- bin-Jiluwi, who is acting in the place of his late father and who is to be confirmed in the appointment, when the King goes to Hasa in the near future. The Amir is a man of 35 or so, repulsive .in appearance owing to a super-squint. Whether from inexperience or of deliberate intention, he received me with a singular lack of ordinary Arab politeness and left on me a most unfavourable general impression. 5. I cannot praise too highly the courtesy which was extended to me on every other occasion, and the efforts made to provide for the comfort of myself and my party, including Mr. Oppenheim and Mr. Ousman, who met Captain de Gaury and myself some little way out from Riyadh. The Saudi Government chartered a launch to convey me from Bahrein to Uqair, where I was met by Taufiq Bey Hamza, the brother of Fuad Bey. He had been brought from Mecca for the purpose, and he saw us through to Jedda. The King received me daily at Riyadh and entertained us at dinner on the 25th November, after a race meeting and riding display, attended by His Majesty, a large number of his sons, and various princes of the Araif and the Bani Rashid. The heir apparent gave us dinner the next evening and was most affable, speaking much of his experiences in England. The King's brothers did not appear on any occasion. 6. I can indeed say that, with the solitary exception of the boorish young man of Hufuf (whose manner was strangely aloof), every Saudi personage or subordinate with whom I came in contact used every endeavour to do honour to me as a British representative. As I have stated elsewhere, my party were treated throughout with the distinction appropriate to a special mission. We were everywhere received with military honours, and a guard was attached to ( r ) Not printed. [581 gg—4]2 our own quarters in the new guest-house near the Badi’s Palace outside Riyadh, where we were accommodated, being the first visitors to use it. 7. Fuad Bey consulted me twice in Riyadh regarding publicity. We agreed on the terms of a statement, not in the form of a communique, to be published in the L mm-al-Qura of the 29th November. I enclose a translation(') of this document, omitting my speech at the G.C.B. audience, which was rendered with sufficient accuracy, although one or two unimportant liberties had been taken by the translator. 8. The Saudi Minister of Finance, who is in temporary charge of Fuad Bey s post at Mecca, came out to Sharay’a to greet me on the evening of the 2nd December. We were met at Hadda by all the remainder of my staff and numerous members of the British, Dutch and American communities in Jedda. 9. I find it difficult to do justice in few words to the kindness which was shown me on my journey to Uqair. Apart from the hospitality extended to me by my colleagues in the foreign service in Egypt and Bagdad, 1 was most excellently entertained by the Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein and their wives. In all these places I was given opportunities of making a very large number of agreeable and useful contacts, including meetings with Nuri Pasha As Said in Bagdad and the rulers of Koweit and Bahrein. I am also greatly indebted to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who came specially from Bushire to meet me at Bahrein and with whom I had a useful exchange of views, following on informative conversations with Colonel Dickson and Colonel Loch. Last, but not least, I have to thank the Royal Air Force for transporting me from Cairo to Bahrein. The arrangements made for this transport were admirable in every way. I would ask that, if you see no objection, official acknowledgments should be addressed to the India Office and the Air Ministry. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department), Bagdad, Bushire, Bahrein and Koweit and Aden. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYANX COPY .

January 4, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. E 6836/318/25 , j &amp; ^ ; Section 1. . r r' r Mr. Eden to Sir A. Ryan (Jedda). Foreign Office, January 4, 1936. O O (No. 7.) Sir, IN proposing the formal prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 the Saudi Government have raised, among other points, the question of amending article 10 of the present treaty with a view to establishing the completely equal status of the English and Arabic versions of the text. This article at present runs as follows :— ££ The present treaty has been drawn up in English and Arabic. Both texts shall be of equal validity; but in case of divergence in the interpreta tion of any part of the treaty the English text shall prevail.” 2. The draft note to prolong the Treaty of Jedda which the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs handed to you for consideration on the 30th March last (a copy of which was enclosed in your despatch No. 113 of the 11th April) contained the following paragraph :— “ (6) The text of article 10 of the Treaty of Jedda, providing that the English text shall prevail in case of divergence, does not imply discrimina tion between the Arabic and English languages, the equal validity of which is established by the said article, but is a matter of scientific facility when it may be necessary for authorised persons to make comparison between the texts. I therefore wish to receive from your Excellency confirmation of the fact that the Arabic and English texts are of equal validity in sense and in interpretation, and that neither of the two texts has preference over the other.” The comment on this proposal in your covering despatch was that, while Fuad Bey’s actual formula seemed unduly complicated, you considered that the principle of full equality between the two languages might well be accepted by His Majesty’s Government in deference to the strong motive of amour-propre and national sentiment which animated the Saudi Government in the matter. You recalled that other Powers, such as France and Italy, had accepted the full equal validity of the Arabic version of their treaty with Saudi Arabia, whereas His Majesty’s Government had even gone so far as to admit the sole validity of the Arabic text of the Anglo-Yemeni Treaty of 1934 (although, as was explained to Fuad Bey, this had only been conceded in view of the very special and primitive circumstances prevailing in the Yemen, where there was no official with a proper knowledge of English). 3. You will recollect that an allusion to the question of language was subsequently made in the course of the general discussion on the arrangements for renewing the Treaty of Jedda at the fourth meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on the 5th July last.(’) Fuad Bey was inclined on that occasion to try to make capital out of the example of the Anglo-Yemeni Treaty, but Mr. Rendel informed him of the very special circumstances existing in that case and made it clear that it could in no circumstances be regarded as a precedent. Mr. Rendel added that the amendment of the present language of article 10 was mainly a formal and technical point on which the competent authorities would have to be consulted in due course. 4. The general practice of His Majesty’s Government (following a rule laid down by Mr. Canning and Lord Palmerston) has always been that bilateral treaties should be in two texts, viz., in English and in the language of the other H Foreign Office Print, “ Eastern (Arabia),” July 5, Section 1. [606 d—1]contracting party, except in the rare cases where the other contracting party assented to the use of English alone. Further, the two texts were to be regarded as of equal validity. In the case of treaties with Arab States, however, the practice in the past has normally been to have both English and Arabic texts, with the English text prevailing in case of divergence. It was therefore in accordance with precedent that it was provided in article 10 of the Treaty of G Jedda that in case of doubt as to the interpretation of the treaty the English text should prevail. At the same time the attempt was made to soften this apparent discrimination against Arabic by providing that “ both texts shall be of equal validity . . . with the result that, although it cannot be doubted that the English text should prevail in case of a divergence of opinion, the phraseology of article 10 is to some extent contradictory. 5. I consider that in modern conditions it is no longer practicable in all cases to insist upon the rule formerly observed with Arab States. In recent years relatively large and important independent Arab States have arisen, such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which must be treated in the matter of the language of treaties on an equal footing with other independent sovereign States. A precedent has already been established in this sense in the case of the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930, which does not provide for either language prevailing in case of doubt, but lays it down that any dispute as to interpretation is to be dealt with by negotiation or through the League of Nations. 6. I accordingly authorise you to inform the Saudi Government that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to accede to their desire to secure equality for the Arabic version of the Treaty of Jedda, and to provide, in any eventual exchange of notes formally prolonging the treaty, for the necessary amendment of the existing article 10. You should add, however, that His Majesty’s Government consider that this amendment can most conveniently and accurately be made not by adopting the formula proposed in the draft note communicated by Fuad Bey on the 30th March, but by providing for the deletion of the words after the semicolon in the second sentence of article 10, so as to leave the operative portion of the article to run as follows without any risk of ambiguity :— “ The present treaty has been drawn up in English and Arabic. Both texts shall be of equal validity.” I consider that this modification could best be effected by means of an explanatory paragraph in the eventual exchange of notes prolonging the Treaty of Jedda, which would put on record the agreed amendment and set out the revised wording of the article. 7. In view of the fact that (as you yourself reported in your despatch No. 113 of the 11th April) there has hitherto been no dispute over the interpre tation of the actual wording of the treaty, I consider that it would be both unnecessary and undesirable to embark on a possibly difficult attempt to find a formula providing for any such dispute to be settled by arbitration or any other means. You should therefore avoid raising on your account the question of the inclusion of any provision of this nature. I am, &amp;c.

December 30, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. E 7575/318/25 H O *7 O O / 1936 Section 2. S'zr ,4. Ryan to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received December 30.) (No. 353.) Sir, Jedda, December 10, 1935. IN my telegram No. 217 of the 8th December, I had the honour to report the results of the action taken by me in Riyadh on your despatch No. 311 of the S( i I , 24th October regarding the question of slavery in Saudi Arabia. I have nothing to add to what I stated in that telegram, except that I satished myself that it would be useless to press Fuad Bey further on the three points which I was unable to settle with him. I understood him to say that, if we agreed to the Saudi slavery regulations as drafted, with the slight further modifications now agreed on, Ibn Saud would be prepared to promulgate them in return for a promise by His Majesty’s Government to renounce their right of manumission after a short interval. 2. I dealt with the question of slavery, as in earlier discussions, as the most important of the matters connected with the proposed prolongation of the validity of the Treaty of Jedda. In this connexion I would offer the following observations on paragraphs 12 to 14 of your despatch No. 311 of the 24th October. Fuad Bey made no reference at Riyadh to the possibility of a new general treaty between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. The conditions foreshadowed in paragraph 13 of your despatch, as those in which the conclusion of such a treaty might be possible, have certainly not arisen. On the other hand, I see no reason why the alternative course of prolonging the validity of the present treaty should not still be pursued, despite the failure which has attended my efforts to secure a settlement of the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers and the uncertain future of other questions not discussed at Riyadh, notably that of air facilities, which I preferred to postpone, and that of the Transjordan frontier, one in which it is for the Saudi Government to make the next move. I have throughout been averse from the alternative discussed in paragraph 14 of your despatch, if it can be avoided. In these circumstances I should prefer, subject to your approval, to proceed still on the lines of the second sentence of para graph 12 of your despatch, that is to say to dispose of the question of slavery, if this is possible, and then to proceed with the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda by an exchange of notes, dealing only with the right of manumission, Arms Traffic and the language of the treaty. 3. As I am not yet in a position to report any further discussion of importance regarding the last two subjects that I have mentioned, I can most conveniently record the position in regard to them in this despatch :— (a) In the course of the conversations at Riyadh I gave Fuad Bey the text of the Arms Traffic formula proposed in paragraph 7 of your despatch p. xf No. 321 of the 6th November. Fuad Bey did not seem to like it very ' 0 muchTdbut we did not discuss it systematically and I propose, in accordance with paragraph 8 of that despatch, to postpone such discussion, if possible, until we have got further with slavery. (b) As regards the language of the treaty, I told Fuad Bey in the course of our general conversations that I thought His Majesty's Government would be prepared to give the Saudi Government satisfaction on this point, but that it was so subsidiary to the other issues that I had ascertained the general views of His Majesty’s Government on the subject only just before leaving England and had not had formal instructions. If you approve of the general proposals in this despatch, and if I can dispose successfully of the questions of slavery and Arms Traffic, I propose to act on the assumption which I expressed in a minute in the Foreign Office file just before I [581 gg—2]( l ) See top of page 3 of “ Eastern (Arabia) ” Print, July 22, Section 1. 2 left, and to express definite readiness to agree on a formula satisfactory to the Saudi Government regarding the language question. 4. I made it clear to Fuad Bey that, if we got to the point of drafting an exchange of notes providing for the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda, the draft notes would have to be submitted for your approval. 5. I would draw attention to one other point. In paragraph 12 of your r - despatch No. !311 you speak of a prolongation “ for a period of, say, seven years.” You will remember that at the sixth meeting with Fuad Bey in London(') Fuad Bey suggested an alternative, viz., prolongation of ten years unless a new treaty should be negotiated in the meanwhile. I should myseif prefer, on the whole, a prolongation for seven years, but I should be glad to know whether, if Fuad Bey renews his alternative suggestion in due course, I may accept it.

It was hoped at the same time that Sir A. Ryan would be able, by means of personal discussions with the King himself, to settle some of the questions outstanding between the Saudi Govt, and H.M.G. 3. It will be seen from the telegrams now submitted that the visit was a great success from the social point of view and Ibn Saud displayed great friendliness towards Sir Andrew and H.M.G. He was particularly pleased with the presentation of the G.C.B. 44. Prom the political point of view, however, it rather looks as if the visit ked not been so successful. It is understood from the Foreign Office that a series of telegrams on the details of the outstanding qjestions discussed at Riyadh is being received from Sir A. Ryan, who has now arrived back at Jedda. But it is disquieting that the King himself left everything except the general „ aspects of the South-Eastern Frontier question (the main question from which the Saudis might expect to gain f* t. ^ : considerable concessions from H.M.G.) to Fuad Hamza. The -x India Office had hoped that personal discussion between the King and Sir Andrew might have resolved the difficulties connected with the Saudi blockade of Kcweit, which from our point of view was the most important question to be settled. 5. However, it is not possible to judge of the precise results of the conversations until the promised individual telegrams are received. /o A/y 4^ t) ■ * W * •Jr* )i / 7' v&gt; POLITICAL COMMITTEE* *7 DEC 1935[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be ' — 11 - - returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] ; 'J'} r f From SAUDI AM3IA .

CONFIDENTIAL. 8236 19^5 - November 6, 1935. Section 1. [E 4241/318/25] Sir Samuel Hoare to Sir A. Rya7i (c/o Political Agent, Bahrein). (No. 321.) Sir, ^ Foreign Office, November 6, 1935. AMONG the subordinate questions which will require settlement as a preliminary to the proposed formal prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda is that of the assurance given in the note of the 19th May, 1927, from Sir Gilbert Clayton to King Abdul Aziz in regard to the export of arms and ammunition from the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia. For convenience of reference I enclose copies of that document and of King Abdul Aziz’s reply thereto which are numbered (5) and (6) in the series of notes exchanged at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Jedda. 2. In your despatch No. 113 of the 11th April last, regarding the proposal of the Saudi Government for the specific prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda, you reported that the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs was anxious to maintain the position created by these two notes, in regard to the question of the export of arms from this country to Saudi Arabia. To this end Fuad Bey had inserted the following paragraph in the draft note to prolong the Treaty of Jedda, which, he suggested, should be addressed to you by the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs :— “ (2) The two letters exchanged between His Majesty the King and General Clayton, dated the 17th DhuT Qada, 1345 (the 19th May, 1927), in respect of the trade in arms, shall continue in force as long as the treaty itself remains in force.” You stated that you had taken the opportunity in the course of your discussion with Fuad Bey to point out that His Majesty’s Government would have to consider his proposal on this point, since the situation in regard to the trade in arms had changed since 1927, and since, in particular, much attention had recently been given to the purchase of arms abroad by belligerent countries. 3. The question of the assurance of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the export of arms to Saudi Arabia was subsequently raised during the conversations with the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs in London last summer. Fuad Bey was informed at the final meeting on the 18th July that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared in principle to extend the validity of the Treaty of Jedda by means of an exchange of notes, provided that a satisfactory settlement were reached on the question of slavery and the other outstanding points of less importance. Among these was the question of the supply of arms, and it was explained that it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to quality their assurance on this point in order to bring it into line with any existing or impending international commitments in regard to arms traffic by which they were or might be bound. Any such qualification would, however, be one of purely general application, involving no discrimination against Saudi Arabia as such. In reply Fuad Bey expressed once more the objections of his Government to any form of discrimination, and said that they could only agree to safeguards, such as those involved in the “ special zones ” of the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention, if they were embodied in general terms applying to the world as a whole. The discussions on this subject closed on the understanding that a new formula would be drafted to embody the original assurance of His Majesty’s Government in revised and up-to-date terms. 4. As a result of further examination of this matter I am advised that, despite the doubt which prevails as to the exact legal connexion between the Treaty of Jedda and the subsidiary notes exchanged at the same time, the under taking given to King Abdul Aziz in Sir Gilbert Clayton’s note of the 19th May,, 1927, is actually co-terminous with the main treaty. It follows that the note [556 f—1]2 would automatically continue to be valid if the Treaty of Jedda itself were to be prolonged, and it accordingly becomes necessary to consider as a preliminary to the formal extension of the treaty what modifications should be introduced in the wording of the original undertaking. 5. The original assurance given by Sir Gilbert Clayton was qualified by a reference to the conditions of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 as prescribing the procedure which should be followed in connexion with orders for the export of arms from the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia. This convention has never come into force. Nevertheless, I am advised that it must still be considered to represent the international standard for the control of the traffic in arms; it has actually been ratified conditionally by the United Kingdom since 1927, and it is clearly impossible to replace it for the purposes of the assurance to the Saudi Government by a reference to the draft convention which was prepared at Geneva in April 1935 by the Committee for the Regulation of the Trade in and Private and State Manufacture of Arms and Implements of. War, and which has only received a first reading. The convention of 1925 may, in fact, be considered to have acquired more authority since the exchange of notes with King Abdul Aziz in 1927, and it is noteworthy that its provisions are utilised as a standard of control in the Four-Power Treaty of August 1930 regulating the importation of arms and ammunition into Abyssinia. In the circumstances I consider that the reference to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 should be maintained in any new version of the assurance. 6. I am advised that the actual effect of the reference to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 is to qualify the original assurance of His Majesty’s Govern ment by making it subject to all the conditions specified in the convention, including those concerning licences and the machinery to ensure that arms are destined solely for the Government of the country ordering them. At the same time articles 33 and 34 of the convention of 1925 introduce safeguards and qualifications in regard to time of war and the obligations arising out of the Covenant of the League of Nations and other treaty instruments. Nevertheless, I remain of the opinion that these safeguards are not sufficient in present inter national conditions, since it is desirable that His Majesty’s Government should make provision for embargoes which they might be compelled to impose, not merely in fulfilment of actual obligations under the Covenant of the League, but also in accordance with any recommendations of the Council under article 11 of the Covenant; or even for the purpose of taking unilateral action to safeguard ^ 7 In order to enable His Majesty’s Government to fulfil their obligations and to exercise an unfettered influence for the preservation of peace I consider, therefore, that Sir Gilbert Clayton’s note of the 19th May, 1927, should not be renewed but should be replaced, as soon as practicable, by a new assurance to be given to King Abdul Aziz on the lines of the following formula “ I am empowered by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to inform you that, subject to the conditions laid down in the Geneva Aims Traffic Convention of 1925, His Majesty’s Government will not, so long as the treaty signed at Jedda on the 20th May, 192/, remains m force, prevent the export from the United Kingdom of arms, &amp;c., purchased by the Saudi Arabian Government for their own use from manufacturers m e United Kino-dom, in normal circumstances. Nevertheless, having regard to developments in the matter of the control of the exports of arms since 1927 His Majesty’s Government must reserve the right to suspend temporarily the operation of this assurance in circumstances m which the international obligations of His Majesty’s Government or any circumstances connected with any war or threat of war should render it necessary. 8. At your own request I have furnished you, without delay, with the explanations in the preceding paragraphs in order that you may be in possession of^mv considered views for your guidance if it prove necessary to discuss the subject wRhKTng Abdul Aziz or his Ministers. At the same time the question of the supply of arms remains a subsidiary point connected with the renewal of the Treaty of Jedda, which is in its turn dependent on a satisfactoiy settlement of the important question of slavery. It would thus be premature for you to take the mitiative in discussing this particular question until agreement has been reached on the slavery issue, and the question of the prolongation o e3 treaty has become more immediate. In the event, however, of King Abdul Aziz or his Ministers raising the matter, either at Riyadh or after your return to your post, you are authorised at your discretion to propose the formula set out in the preceding paragraph to replace the undertaking given in Sir Gilbert Clayton’s above-mentioned note. I am, &amp;c. SAMUEL HOARE. Enclosure 1. Sir G. Clayton to His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies.

The main conclusion was that however ethically desirable the total suppression of slavery in Arabia might be, the practical difficulties of securing this were overwhelming in view of the present attitude of the people and the actual organisation of society. Our action must for the moment be limited to measures which act as a palliative and, judged by this standard, the proposed Saudi x legislation is satisfactory enough, and should remove the more obvious abuses. The proposed agreement is to be bi-partite, as the Saudi Government are not prepared to adhere to any international Slavery Convention, but the exact form which the agreement will take - whether 3330 1000 12.34 a/a separate exchange of notes, or an exchange of notes prolonging the Treaty of Jedda or part of an entirely new treaty - has not been decided and will depend upon the progress of the other negotiations at Riyadh, (sa.)

CONFIDENTIAL , I935 J Section 1. [E 6120/325/25] r Sir Samuel Hoare to Sir Andrew Ryan (on leave). (?so. 311.) Sir, Foreign Office, October 24, 1935. ON your departure from England to return to your post, I think it desirable that you shall proceed to Jedda by way of Riyadh in the hope that you may, by personal discussion with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, be able to pave the way for the settlement of various questions outstanding between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia, Separate instructions are being issued to you as to the attitude which you will adopt and the policy which you will follow in regard to the various questions which are likely to arise. In this despatch I propose to deal with the question of slavery in Saudi Arabia, with particular reference to the proposal that His Majesty’s Government should abandon, in return for adequate anti-slavery regulation by King Abdul Aziz, the right of manumission which they at present exercise at His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda, in accordance with the practice confirmed by letters Nos. 3 and 4 exchanged at • the time of the signature of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927. 2. Sir John Simon in his despatch No. 452 of the 13th December, 1934 A (a copy of which is annexed( 1 ) ), authorised you to discuss this subject with the Saudi Government, provided they were prepared to offer in return effective legislation which would be at least as satisfactory as the present system in securing the actual reduction of slavery and alleviation of its evils. 3. Since then you have held numerous discussions with the Saudi Govern ment in Jedda, and with the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs in London during his visit here last summer. As the result of these discussions, Fuad Bey Hamza communicated to you a draft of the proposed Saudi “ regula tion ” on slavery, which he was prepared to recommend King Abdul Aziz to promulgate as a necessary preliminary to the abandonment by His Majesty’s Government of their existing right of manumission. A translation of this draft regulation forms an enclosure in this despatch. 4. This draft regulation has now been examined in consultation with you and with Sir George Maxwell, the United Kingdom representative on the League of Nations Expert Slavery Committee, and, generally speaking, it appears to me sufficiently satisfactory to justify the negotiation of a settlement on the lines proposed in my predecessor’s despatch. 5. The Saudi Government having represented that it would not be possible for King Abdul Aziz to promulgate legislation on the lines of the enclosed draft in any way which might suggest that it was the result of foreign pressure, an essential feature of the procedure now contemplated is that the promulgation of this legislation shall appear to be spontaneous. On the other hand, the Saudi Government are, not unnaturally, loath to take the first step by promulgating this legislation unless they have some guarantee that its promulgation will be followed by the abandonment by His Majesty’s Government of their existing right of manumission. It has therefore been suggested that you should address to the Saudi Government a confidential but official communication formally under taking that, if and when the proposed regulation has been promulgated, His Majesty’s Government will in due course abandon their right. Provided that there is a definite understanding as to the nature of the legislation in question, and that your note to the Saudi Government is so worded as to make it clear that it will not be applicable if the legislation does not take the form previously agreed upon, I have no objection to this procedure; and, if you can reach an agreement with King Abdul Aziz as to the terms of the legislation, you are authorised at your discretion either to address to His Majesty during your stay [531 aa—1] P) December 13, 1934, Section 1. Bat Riyadh, or to the Saudi Government after your return to Jedda, a formal and confidential note in the above sense. 6. The draft regulation itself appears to me to be of a sufficiently satisfactory character to justify the abandonment by His Majesty’s Government of their right of manumission. It contains, however, certain points which could be much improved; and I desire that you will discuss them with the proper authorities before you formally agree to the present draft. 7. I understand that you are satisfied that the prohibition against the import of slaves into Saudi Arabia by sea, contained in sub-head 1 of article 1, is clearly intended to be of universal application, notwithstanding the reference in the preamble of the article to so-called “ treaty States.” In this case, no further amendment to this sub-head is essential; though this point would be placed beyond any possible doubt if the words “ from any country ” were added at the end of the sub-head. 8. A point of greater importance is in sub-head 2 of article 1, where I agree with you that an amendment should be inserted to make it clear that the exception would not cover persons recently enslaved in the Yemen, and that the “ document ” provided for should mean an official document of such a nature as would establish the fact that the person to whom it refers was already a slave before the inauguration of the present regime in the Hejaz. Such an amendment would not alter the purport of the sub-head, and should therefore not be difficult to obtain. You will therefore make every effort to persuade the Saudi authorities to introduce it. 9. Article 4 of the draft regulation has formed the subject of much discussion between you and Fuad Bey, and I share your objection to agreeing to the time limit established in it, which would deprive of any remedy persons “ unlawfully ” enslaved before the inauguration of the Saudi regime in the Hejaz, i.e., before 1925, whereas such persons have at present some chance of regaining their liberty by taking refuge at His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda. You should endeavour, therefore, to secure an amendment of it in a form which would extend the period to an earlier date or, better still, impose no time limit at all. Failing this, I should be satisfied with a formula which would provide for redress in really hard cases dating from before the Saudi regime, e.g., cases in which the applicant or his relatives could show a clear recollection of the circumstances of the enslavement. On the other hand, ten years have now elapsed since the institution of the Saudi regime in the Hejaz, and the number of persons enslaved before that time who are still likely to seek manumission at His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda is steadily decreasing. While therefore the proposed article might involve hardship in a limited number of cases of persons enslaved before the institution of the Saudi regime in the Hejaz who may still be hoping to regain their liberty by seeking manumission from His Majesty’s Legation, the fact that these persons have taken no such action for so long a period renders the matter one rather of theoretical than of practical importance, and the objections to the proposed article are in practice likely to become less and less cogent. It thus seems questionable whether His Majesty’s Government would be justified in risking on this point alone the loss of the other important advantages of potential future value presented by the draft regulation. You may therefore in the last resort, if unable to overcome the strong objections of the Saudi Government to any amendment of this article, accept the article in its present form. 10. A further point on which I request that you will make every effort to secure an amendment of the draft regulation is the final proviso of article 5, which appears to give a slave-owner the power to reserve to himself at the time of a marriage between his slaves the right eventually to separate the husbfind and wife. I recognise that this proviso is based on ancient and still existing practice in Arabia where, moreover, marriage relations are generally of a looser character than in non-Moslem countries. None the less, it is particularly repugnant to western ideas and may well cause considerable criticism when the regulations become known in this country and have to be invoked publicly in justification of the action of His Majesty’s Government in abandoning their right of manumission. While, therefore, it is most desirable on the one hand that article 5 of the draft regulation be amended in this respect, I am, on the other hand, well aware that there are limits beyond which King Abdul Aziz cannot go in opposing practices which have the approval of the overwhelming majoritv of his subjects in general, and of the Ulema in particular. You may thus find3 that His Majesty will oppose any such suggestions by pleading the force of opinion in Saudi Arabia, and to this argument His Majesty’s Government can, in the last resort, only reply by emphasising the force of public opinion in this country. While therefore you will press very strongly for the omission or modification of this passage, I see no alternative but to authorise you to accept n it as it stands if, in your judgment, the success of an otherwise promising negotiation would be jeopardised by further opposition on this point. 11. Sir John Simon, in paragraph 4 of his despatch No. 452 of the 13th December, 1934, referred to a suggestion by Sir George Maxwell that action might be taken to bring Saudi Arabia into the orbit of the efforts being made by the League of Nations to end slavery, at least to the extent of securing her accession to article 2 (a) of the International Slavery Convention, 1926. After taking into full consideration the general indifference of the Saudi Government, as reported by you from time to time since the issue of Sir John Simon’s instructions on this point, to the League of Nations and its activilies, I am of opinion that it will be preferable, at any rate for the present, that His Majesty’s Government, who at least have something with which to bargain in the proposed abandonment of their right of manumission, shall continue to deal with the matter as an Anglo-Saudi question, and that the idea of securing the accession of Saudi Arabia to article 2 (a) of the International Slavery Convention of 1926 shall not be pursued at the present time, though it may be possible to revert to it, independently of the present negotiations, at some future date. In any case it may be hoped that other influences, such as the force of public opinion in Europe generally and among enlightened Moslems in other countries, may gradually induce the Saudi Government to make effective any regulations which they adopt on this subject. 12. The question whether, if you are able to reach an agreement with King Abdul Aziz in regard to the draft Saudi regulation, the eventual abandonment by His Majesty’s Government of their right of manumission shall be made independently, or as part of an arrangement for the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda, is distinct from that of the main issue dealt with in this despatch. Generally speaking, however, and subject to such views as you may derive from your conversations with King Abdul Aziz, the best method will be to adopt the suggestion originally made by you, that, when certain matters, of which this question of slavery is the most important, have been satisfactorily settled, the Treaty of Jedda shall be formally prolonged by an exchange of notes. Both parties would undertake therein not to exercise for a period of, say, seven years, their right under article 8 of the treaty to denounce it on six months’ notice, while His Majesty’s Government would, in the same exchange of notes, record their renunciation of the right of manumission which they have maintained under the letters exchanged between the late Sir Gilbert Clayton and King Abdul Aziz at the time of the original conclusion of the treaty. 13. On the other hand, should your negotiations with King Abdul Aziz on such subjects as that of the south-eastern frontiers make sufficient progress to justify you in recommending the conclusion of an entirely new treaty to replace the Treaty of Jedda of 1927, it would still be possible to fall back on the first of the two courses of action suggested in paragraph 12. 14. Alternatively, so little progress may be made with the settlement of the other questions in dispute that it may be impossible or undesirable either to renew the Treaty of Jedda in the manner ^proposed, or to conclude a fresh treaty. In that event I shall be prepared, on your recommendation, to consider the conclusion of the proposed arrangement for the abandonment by His Majesty’s Government of their right of manumission in return for the promulgation of the proposed legislation; and, in that case, the arrangement would have to be incorporated in a separate exchange of notes dealing with that subject only. 15. It may be that during your visit to Riyadh no suitable opportunity will present itself for you to discuss this question with the King in person. In that case, the question will arise whether you will take any initiative in raising it on your return to Jedda, if the Saudi Government do not themselves raise it. On the whole, I incline to the view that the balance of argument is in favour of proceeding with the matter, even if the Saudi Government do not themselves revive the question. I am, however, prepared to leav^ it to your discretion, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time, whether to take any such initiative or not. If you are in any doubt on the point, you may seek my further [531 aa—1] b 24 r instructions by telegram or despatch according to the circumstances. If the Saudi Government take the initiative in discussing the matter, or if you decide, in the exercise of your discretion, that it is desirable for you to raise it yourself, you will naturally still be guided by the present instructions, copies of which are being sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda for his information.

This invitation has been accepted and, although the visit will not technically be of an official character, Sir Samuel Eoare attaches much importance to it. No British representative has been received at Riyadh for many years, and it is hoped that this visit may be the occasion both of consolidating His Majesty’s Government’s relations with King Ibn Baud and of promoting the settlement of some of the questions now under discussion with the Saudi Government* 2. The Secretary of State is moreover of opinion that it would be advantageous if Sir Andrew Ryan could, in the course of his journey to Riyadh, make or renew, as may be the case, personal contact with the British authorities in Iraq, and the Persian Gulf. Sir Andrew Ryan is unable to leave the United Kingdom by sea, as he is anxious to do for reasons of health, before the 28th October, and considers it important that his visit to Riyadh should be concluded by the beginning of Ramadhan on the 27th November. The time available for/ Copy .

It would, however, be inconvenient for- Sir Andrew Rjran to have to rely for the short intermediate flights which such a journey would entail upon a service such as that of Imperial Airways Limited, which caters mainly for travellers between terminal points* This service, moreover, operates only at fixed intervals which may not suit the requirements of Sir Andrew Ryan or of the British political authorities at the places concerned. The suggestion has therefore been made that it might be possible for Sir Andrew Ryan to be transported from Cairo to Bahrain by the Royal Air Force* Sir Andrew Ryan has indicated that if this could be arranged it would be a friendly gesture if he were to invite Fuad Bey Hamza, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia, who will be in Cairo at the same time, to accompany him. The party would be joined at Bagdad by Captain de Gaury, M*C•, Honorary Attache at His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda* 4* This proposal which, in Sir Samuel Hoare’s view, has much to commend it, has formed the subject of oral discussion and semi-official correspondence with your Department ending with Mr. Hard’s letter, of the 7th September to Wing-Commander Pirie. Details of dates, baggage, etc. have been furnished to your Department by Sir Andrew Ryan, and it is understood that in the light of this information the projected flights would be unlikely to cause difficulties of a technical nature and that they could to some extent at least be combined with normal service flights ior training/Itraining purposes* 5. Sir Samuel Hoare would accordingly 'be grateful if, provided the Air Council see no objection, the necessary authorisation could be given for Sir Andrew Ryan, Puad Bey Hamza, and Captain de daury, with their personal baggage, to be transported by the Royal Air Force from Cairo to Bahrain either in the course of training flight or, where this is not possible, in machines specially detailea for the purpose.

WITH reference to the last paragraph of your telegram No. 69 of the 26th April, I have the honour to state that on the 30th April Fuad Bey Hamza, whom I had sounded privately as to the possibility of my visiting Riyadh on my return from leave early next winter, informed me that the King welcomed this suggestion with great satisfaction. He conveyed to me a definite invitation from His Majesty and said that the Saudi Government would wish to send transport for me to Koweit, which I indicated as my probable starting-point for the interior. He suggested three cars. Fuad Bey and I discussed more airily incidental details, including the possibility of our meeting in Beirut and travelling together. 2. At our first business meeting of the 6th May, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who is acting for Fuad Bey, confirmed the invitation in very cordial and explicit terms. He said that the King expressed the hope that I would accept his hospitality during the whole journey from Koweit and enquired as to my intended dates in order that all preparations might be made. 3. On both occasions I expressed suitable gratitude and readiness to avail myself of the King’s proffered hospitality. I explained to Sheikh Yusuf that I could not work out my programme until I arrived in England, but that I should probably reach Koweit about the middle of November or a little later. 4. I will take an early opportunity of discussing the details of the proposed journey with your Department after my arrival in London. In the meanwhile I need only observe that, in view of the special nature of the occasion, it will be desirable to accomplish the journey with some ceremony and that, while little expense will be incurred for actual travelling once I reach Koweit, the expenditure on gifts and gratuities will be somewhat heavy. In principle I would propose to travel from Koweit to Riyadh with one Arabic-speaking companion and one servant, and to be met at Riyadh by two members of my staff here. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to Koweit, Bagdad, Bushire and the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. [406 dd—4]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). April 29, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [E 2704/318/25] Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received Afril 29.) of the draft note which Fuad Bey handed to me on the 30th March. This document is intended as the basis of an eventual exchange of notes providing for a prolongation of the validity of the treaty for ten years from the date of signature, subject to certain provisos. If the principle of the extension were agreed to, I presume that there would be no objection to effecting it by an exchange of notes, but the drafting would, I think, require considerable amendment. In particular, it would be necessary to define the position when the end of the ten years was approaching. 2. I had conversations in general terms with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 3rd and the 5th April regarding his draft. I expressed personal sympathy with the idea of a prolongation of the treaty for ten years, subject to agreement being reached on the specific matters mentioned in the draft. I now submit the following observations, based on my study of these matters and partly on my conversations with Fuad Bey. 3. Fuad Bey wishes to reaffirm the position as regards traffic in arms, &amp;c., created by letters (5) and (6) attached to the treaty. I suggested that this might require careful consideration, not because His Majesty’s Government would wish to prevent the Saudi Government from purchasing arms, &amp;c., from British sources in normal circumstances, but because the situation to-day was different from that in 1927. Bearing in mind the correspondence ending with Foreign Office despatch No. 120 of the 25th March, 1931, I observed that the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 had never come into force, and that there was now practically no chance of its ever doing so. I observed, also, that the question of the purchase of arms in abnormal circumstances, i.e., by belligerents, had of late attracted great attention. 4. Fuad Bey’s proposal regarding the estates of pilgrims relates not to letters (7) and (8) attached to the treaty, but to article 4 of the treaty itself. I see no objection to the principle of the proposal, which would appear to have been suggested by the correspondence regarding the sale of certain effects at Medina, to which I referred in my telegram. It is for consideration whether the opportunity should not be taken of getting rid of the inconvenient definition of international practice in letter (8). This formed the subject of correspondence ending with your despatch No. 332 of the 22nd August, 1931 (see paragraph 8 below). 5. I do not think that exception can be taken to the proposed reservation regarding Aqaba and Ma’an. It would be hopeless in present circumstances to attempt to get the Saudi Government to waive their claim, and its maintenance in the form proposed might, if anything, be advantageous in the sense that the exchange of notes would imply, even if it did not legally establish, the preservation of the status quo for ten years. 6. The proposal that His Majesty’s Government should renounce the right of manumission is crucial. My own view is that, if it were decided to abandon this right in consideration of the promulgation of regulations on slavery, which satisfied His Majesty’s Government, it would be a very good plan to provide for the renunciation in the proposed exchange of notes, provided that the regulations had been made public at some earlier date. When discussing the subject of slavery with Fuad Bey, I put it to him that this would be the proper order of two transactions which it was not desired to connect publicly with each other, lest the Saudi Government should appear to have adopted the regulations under [381 ff—4]4 r 2 toreign pressure. I will deal with the whole of this subject further, when our discussions on the slavery question have advanced further. 7. The formula regarding the language of the treaty seems to me to be unduly tortured. The principle appears to me to be one which His Majesty’s Government might well accept in deference to the strong motive of amour-proyre, which animates the Saudi Government in this matter. The present text oW article 10^ of the treaty is to some extent contradictory. As no dispute ovel matters of the linguistic interpretation has ever, so far as I am aware, arisen, I should be personally prepared to renounce the stipulation in favour of the English text. Other Powers, e.g., France and Italy, have accepted the principle of equal validity. His Majesty’s Government themselves accepted in their treaty with the Y emen the ascendency of the Arabic over the English text. It is, of course, true, as Mr. Rendel pointed out to Euad Bey last September, that that was not intended as a compliment to the King of the Yemen or his language; but the fact remains that it has become a point of honour with the Saudi Government to insist that the “ noble Arabic language ” is as good as any other for all purposes. 8. It has also to be considered whether, if His Majesty’s Government should in due course agree to the prolongation of the validity of the treaty, subject to provisos desired by the Saudi Government, they should not seek on their side to impose conditions of their own. In this connexion, I would refer to paragraphs 8 and 9 of my memorandum of the 17th October, 1933, a copy of which was sent to this post with your printed despatch No. 290 of the 26th October, 1933. I have not materially altered the views expressed in that paper. Broadly speaking, I do not attach very great importance from a practical point of view to most of the points to which I drew attention in the paragraphs referred to, and I consider that, in present circumstances, it would be wise to limit any conditions on the British side as far as possible. This does not apply to paragraph 9 (7), the subject matter of which has grown not less but more important since 1933. It has been the subject of so much separate correspondence that I need not now enlarge on it, except to say that the proposed exchange of notes might conceivably be a convenient vehicle for any settlement of the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, if such a settlement proves possible in the near future. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to the Government of India, Transjordan and Bushire. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure. Draft Note to be Addressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the British Legation. YOU are aware that after the expiry of the period of seven years fixed for the validity of the Treaty of Jedda, viz., September 1934, the relations established between the Saudi Arab Kingdom and the United Kingdom in Great Britain, in accordance with that treaty, have become susceptible of abrogation, (and) after one of the contracting parties shall have given the other six months’ notice of his intention to abrogate it. In view of the fact that it would be to the mutual interests which both parties must desire to strengthen and consolidate, the Government of His Majesty the King desire to agree with the Government of the United Kingdom in Great Britain on a new and stable arrangement. Therefore, and in accordance with the mutual desire shown by the two parties on numerous occasions in regard to the prolongation of the effect of the provisions of the Treaty of Jedda for a long period, my Government wish to take the following steps in this connexion :— (1) With the exception of what is stated in the following paragraphs, the Government of His Majesty the King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom agree to the extension of the effect of the Treaty of Jedda, which was signed on Friday, the18th Dhu’l Qada, 1345 A.H. (the 20th May, 1927), for a period of ten complete years as from to-day’s date. (2) The two letters exchanged between His Majesty the King and General Clayton, dated the 17th DhuT Qada, 1345 (the 19th May, 1927), in respect of trade in arms, shall continue in force as long as the treaty itself remains in force. ^ (3) The two letters exchanged between His Majesty the King and General Clayton, dated the 19th DhuT Qa’da, 1345 (the 20th May, 1927), concerning the handing over of the effects of deceased pilgrims, shall remain in force as long as the treaty remains in force, provided that the competent authorities in the Saudi Arab Kingdom may, at the express request of the British Government, sell such effects and pay over their value in cash. (4) The Government of His Majesty the King reserve their rights in the district of Aqaba and Ma’an, as indicated in the letter of His Majesty the King, addressed to General Clayton, dated the 18th DhuT Qa’da, 1345 (the 20th May, 1927), in reply to General Clayton’s letter, dated the 19th May, 1927 (the 17th DhuT Qa’da, 1345). (5) The operation of the two letters exchanged between His Majesty the King and General Clayton, dated the 18th DhuT Qa’da, 1345 (the 19th May, 1927), relative to the right of manumitting slaves, exercised by the British agents and consuls, shall be abolished as from to-day’s date. (6) The text of article 10 of the Treaty of Jedda, providing that the English text shall prevail in case of divergence, does not imply discrimination between the Arabic and English languages, the equal validity of which is established by the said article, but is a matter of scientific facility when it may be necessary for authorised persons to make comparison between the texts. I therefore wish to receive from your Excellency confirmation of the fact that the Arabic and English texts are of equal validity in sense and in interpretation, and that neither of the two texts has preference over the other. I therefore request that your Excellency would be good enough to inform me whether the Government of the United Kingdom in Great Britain approve of this arrangement, in which case my letter and your reply thereto shall be considered as a formal document recording the agreement between the two Governments. With highest respects, &amp;c. (Note. —The dates in the above translation are as in the text of Fuad Bey’s draft, but do not in all cases agree with those in the English official version of the treaty, &amp;c.)[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be n returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] F EOI.l S.g.JI A5-\EIA De c ode.

He added that the Crown Prince desired his own special thanks to he conveyed to His Majesty and to His Majesty's Government. I suitably acknowledged the communication for which I thanked him and undertook at once to convey it to its high destination.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT IN continuation of my despatch No. J-91 o f the 11th July, regarding the visit to England of the Crown Prince of SaudT Arabia, I have to inform you that His Royal Highness the Amir Saud, accompanied by the members of his suite, left this country on the 22nd July on the return journey to Saudi Arabia, and proceeded to Paris. 2. The Amir was seen off at Victoria Station by the Lord in Waiting, repre senting His Majesty the King, and Mr. J. B. Monck on behalf of myself. His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, officials of the Foreign Office, members of the Diplomatic Corps in London and a considerable number of other persons, including prominent Moslems resident in England, were also present to take leave of His Royal Highness. I enclose herein an extract^) from the Times of the 23rd July, containing the text of messages which were addressed by the Amir at the time of his departure to the press and the general public, with a view to expressing his gratitude for the hospitality he had received in this country. 3. You are already aware, from my telegram No. 88 of the 18th July and from other correspondence, of the position reached as a result of the series of political conversations that have taken place with the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs during the course of the visit. 4. In addition to the engagements mentioned in the last two paragraphs of my despatch No. 191, the Amir visited, during the last fortnight of his stay, the Bank of England, the Royal Mint and the offices and studio of the British Broadcasting Corporation. His Royal Highness also undertook a short motor tour in the Midlands, in the course of which he spent a night at Stratford-on- Avon and visited the works of the Humber Motor Company. 5. In his despatch No. 148 of the 27th May, recording the departure of the Amir Saud from Jedda at the outset of his journey to Europe, Sir Andrew Ryan referred to the belief that His Royal Highness would return by way of Turkey, Syria and Iraq. This appears, in fact, to have been the original intention, but early in July the decision was taken (for what reason is not known) to abandon the idea of visiting these countries. It was suggested at one moment that the visit to Amman, which had been definitely arranged as a result of telegraphic correspondence between King Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah (copies of which were enclosed in Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 159 of the 25th May), should also be given up, and the Amir return by the direct sea route to Jedda. It is understood, however, that King Ibn Saud eventually insisted upon the visit to Transjordan being carried out, in view of the fact that the Amir Abdullah’s invitation had already been definitely accepted, and that it would be discourteous to cancel the visit. 6. According to present arrangements the Amir and his suite will spend some time in France and Switzerland (it is understood that a proposal to visit Germany has not been pursued) before embarking on the Egyptian steamship El Nil at Genoa on the 7th or 8th August. The ship is expected to arrive at Alexandria on the 12th August, and after spending the night in Alexandria His Royal Highness will proceed the next day by train direct to Jerusalem, where he will arrive on the 14th August and stay at Government House for two nights, before proceeding to Amman on the 16th August. His Royal Highness proposes to return to Jerusalem from Amman on the 19th August, and to leave the following day for Suez, where he will embark on the 21st August or the 22nd August on the Khedivial Mail or the Lloyd Triestino steamer for Jedda. 7.

The matters which are of particular interest to India (e.g. the S.E. Frontier question, the Koweit blockade, the Bahrein transit dues, etc.) are of course dealt with on their appropriate files.

As matters have turned out, they seem to have achieved/ 3330 1000 12.34achieved almost nothing. But no doubt the Foreign Office have cleared a great deal of ground, and apparently the talks had at any rate the advantage of giving Sir Andrew Ryan more opportunity than he has in Jedda of meeting Fuad Hamza, who is, for practical * purposes, Saudi Foreign Minister. Fuad went to a European watering place on the conclusion of the conversations, and a considerable time is likely to elapse before anything much more happens.

They have undertaker carefully to study data supplied by Fuad Bey in support of Saudi Government's claims to much more extensive area. (d; Treaty of Jedda: Fuad Bey has been given oral assurance that, subject to agreement over slavery, arms traffic and other minor matters, His majesty's Government will be ready to prolong Treaty for ten years by exchange of notes on lines proposed if no new instrument is negotia ted meanwhile. (c) Slavery: As a result of further private conversa tions between Sir A. Byan and Fuad Bey latter has produced draft slavery regulations which he thinks Ibn Baud may consent to promulgate and which Sir A. Ryan considers acceptable except as regards one point. Draft is being studied. (d) Arms Traffic: His Majesty's Government have indicated orally that they will not discriminate oguinst S.m.ui Arauia as such, but that it will be necessary to evolve a new formula talcing account of international developments ...\. 2 * developments since letters exchanged on conclusion of Treaty of Jedda were written. (e) Transjordan-Nejd frontier: Position has been fully explained to Fuad Bey who undertook to submit to Ibn Saud suggestions of His Majesty's Government that Saudi Government should either agree to maintenance of present situation * of fact, or failing this to joint survey, agreement as to principles of interpretation of Rudda line in view of inaccuracy of naps, and subsequent delimitation commission. (f) .Air Facilities: Fuad is insisting on payment and on separate agreements in respect of Royal Mr Force and of Imperial Airways. Matter is under consideration by Air Ministry. (g) Bahrain transit dues: Assurance regarding Ahmedi policy has been given orally, and will eventually be confirmed by separate note. Meanwhile Fuad Bey has been informed that, although there appears no longer to be any disagreement on any point of substance, proposed exchange of notes is delayed by need for clarification of certain points in Bahrain delegates 5 letter.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. ' [E 4486/318/25] Record of Sixth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 18, 1935. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). This was the final meeting of the series, and the opportunity was taken to review' the position reached as a result of the earlier conversations, and to decide on the procedure to be followed in future negotiations. I. Mr. RENDEL opened the meeting by recalling the present position in the negotiations about the frontiers of the Saudi Kingdom in Eastern and South- Eastern Arabia. His Majesty’s Government were now in possession of the detailed information supplied by Fuad Bey in his letter of the 2nd July, and his memorandum of the 8th July in support of the boundary claimed by King Abdul Aziz. This information had been passed on to the British authorities in the Persian Gulf and in the Aden Protectorate, who would now devote themselves to a thorough examination of the Saudi case. The eventual conclusions of His Majesty’s Government would be largely based upon the reports they received from these authorities, but he could assure Fuad Bey that the claims of King Abdul Aziz would receive full and fair consideration. FUAD BEY HAMZA said that he would like to tetke this opportunity to mention that the names given in his letter and subsequent memorandum were not only of wells, but also of places and districts. As the names had been obtained from Bedouin tribesmen, it would obviously be impossible to find many of them on the maps. Some of the wells and places mentioned were, however, close to the Qatar peninsula or the coast of the Persian Gulf and were quite well known. Mr. RENDEL then concluded the discussion of the south-eastern frontiers by informing Fuad Bey that the reply of His Majesty’s Government to his two communications would be returned to the Saudi Government in due course through His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda. II. The discussion then turned to the question of the Bahrein transit dues. Mr. RENDEL said that he feared it would not be possible to prepare draft notes embodying the agreement reached at the local conference in time for them to be shown to Fuad Bey before he left England on the 22nd July. The wording of the letter from the Bahrein delegation detailing the concessions their Govern ment was prepared to make to Saudi Arabia was not entirely clear in some respects, and it would probably be necessary for the draft notes to be referred to the Government of Bahrein for concurrence before they were communicated to the Saudi Government. At the same time Mr. Rendel wished to repeat the formal assurance he had given Fuad Bey at their previous meeting that the Government of Bahrein would not at any future time again penalise ships (like the s.s. Ahmedi) calling at Bahrein and carrying cargo direct to the mainland of Arabia without tranship ment in Bahrein waters. His Majesty’s Government intended to confirm this perpetual assurance in a separate note to be addressed to the Saudi Government at the time of the main exchange of notes. [456 y—1] BFUAD BEY HAMZA explained that he had not received any recent instructions from his Government about this question, and so was not in a position to do more than take note of what Mr. Rendel said. He suggested, how ever, that it might be useful if he were to see the draft notes before they were formally communicated to the Saudi Government for their concurrence. After further discussion it was agreed that as soon as the draft notes ha^ been approved by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Bahrein, copies of them should be sent to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba for onward transmission to Fuad Bey Hamza, wherever he might then be in the course of his leave. At the same time ithe draft notes would be sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda, who would be instructed to communicate them formally to the Saudi Government for their concurrence, as soon as Fuad Bey Hamza had expressed his personal agreement with the terms employed in the drafts. III. Mr. RENDEL next referred to the debt due from the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. He explained that His Majesty’s Government had no desire to embarrass the Saudi Government by raising this matter; but their position, too, was not easy since they were liable to criticism in Parliament and by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons if steps were not taken with a view to liquidating the debt. His Majesty’s Government had learned with much satisfaction of the repayment by the Saudi Government last May of their half share of the cost of the enquiry conducted by Mr. Macdonell in 1931 into the rival claims arising out of tribal raids between Transjordan and the Hejaz and Nejd, and of their payment of 10 per cent, of the capital of the larger debt for £31,437 4.?. 6^. due on account of arms and ammunition supplied to King Ibn Saud in 1929. His Majesty’s Government would now be grateful to learn the intentions of the Saudi Govern ment in regard to the repayment of the remainder of the arms debt, and he was authorised to inform Fuad Bey that if satisfactory arrangements could be made for the repayment of the outstanding 90 per cent, of the capital of the debt within a reasonable period, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to take a sympathetic view of the question of interest on the debt. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he would lodk into the matter with a view to producing a statement of the intentions of his Government about the repayment of the remainder of the debt. IV. The next matter to be touched upon was the future of the Treaty of Jedda, and the connected questions of slavery and the traffic in arms. Mr. RENDEL said that he was now authorised to inform Fuad Bey that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared in principle to extend the validity of the Treaty of Jedda for a further seven years by means of an exchange of notes, on the lines already suggested by Fuad Bey, provided that a satisfactory settle ment were reached on the question of slavery and the other outstanding points of less importance. SIR A. RYAN pointed out that in his draft exchange of notes Fuad Bey had suggested prolonging the treaty for ten years. Mr. RENDEL replied that he had mentioned seven years because that was the period of validity of the original treaty. He thought that neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Saudi Government were ready just yet to conclude a new treaty, and, in the circumstances, he agreed with Fuad Bey that there would be advantage in stabilising relations between their two countries by prolonging the existing treaty for a definite term of years. As a new treaty would probably be a subject for negotiation before very long, he thought seven years might be a sufficient period. At the same time, there would, of course, be no question of the treaty automatically expiring at the end of the seven years, as it would continue to run on indefinitely, as at present, subject to denunciation at six months’ notice.FUAD BEY suggested that the treaty might be prolonged for ten years, unless a new treaty were negotiated in the meanwhile. Mr. RENDEL and SIR A. RYAN thought that this was a useful formula, to which there could be no objection, and agreed to recommend it to His Majesty s Government. The discussion then turned to the question of slavery and manumission m relation to the prolongation of the treaty. iS Mr. RENDEL reminded Fuad Bey that the whole question of the renewal of the treaty hinged on a settlement being reached on this issue which would be satisfactory from the point of view of their respective Governments. He under stood from Sir A. Ryan that his private discussions with Fuad Bey had shown that there was a good prospect of agreement, although there were still a tew points outstanding about which Sir Andrew was not entirely happy, particularly the reluctance of Fuad Bey to agree to make the clause in the regulations affording redress to persons who could show that they had been illegally ensla'v e in the past, applicable to persons enslaved prior to the establishment ot the present regime in the Hejaz. If Sir A. Ryan felt any doubts about the adequacy of the slavery regulations which the Saudi Government were proposing to issue, Fuad Bey could be sure that they would not satisfy public and parliamentary opinion in this country when it became necessary for His Majesty s Government to justify the surrender of their right of manumission. FUAD BEY observed that His Majesty’s Government were not alone m experiencing difficulties over the slavery question. He had only received very general instructions from King Abdul Aziz to guide him in his negotiations on the subject, and he feared that in his discussions with Sir Andrew Ryan he mi Hit already have gone too far and be unable to obtain approval 101 the concessions he had offered. He begged His Majesty’s Government to realise that Kino 1 Abdul Aziz had himself to reckon with the force of public opinion m regard to slavery, which was an ancient and established institution in Arabia, sanctined by Islamic law and tradition. His Majesty would have to consult his tribal and religious leaders, and they might well, if only from motives of self-interest, retuse to agree to the far-reaching measures that were now proposed. Fuad Bey pointed out that, in introducing reforms on the subject of slavery, King Abdul Aziz would have to contend with a mass of vested interests, as well as with the religious feelings of important sections of the population. Mr RENDEL and SIR ANDREW RYAN replied that they fully appreciated the difficulties that confronted King Abdul Aziz and the Saudi Government and were most anxious that His Majesty should, if possible, obtain the prior consent of the ulema and the tribal leaders befoie intioducmg the proposed reforms. Mr. RENDEL desired, however, to point out that His Majesty’s Government were only asking King Abdul Aziz to carry out certain reforms that were, m any case, inevitable before very long, if, as they hoped, Saudi Arabia were to continue to maintain its present rate of progress under the enlightened rule of His Maiesty and to take its proper international place in the modern world. The mdenmte continuance of slavery as an institution was not possible m the conditions ot the present day, and he cited the trouble which Abyssinia was experiencing through the continuance of slavery within her borders. „ . . He begged Fuad Bey to submit to King Abdul Aziz the result ot his conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan on the subject of slavery, and to try to obtain from His Majesty some definite and far-reaching proposals which could be laid before Ministers here as a satisfactory counterpart to the surrender o± the right of manumission. Once agreement had been reached on the question or slavery, nothing would stand in the way of the Treaty of Jedda being piolonged. FUAD BEY promised to do his best to produce as soon as possible the final proposals of his Government. It was agreed that when these were available they would be submitted to Ministers without delay, and a communication containing the views of His Majesty’s Government would then be made to the Saudi Government through His Majesty’s representative at Jedda. The discussion then turned to the question of the prolongation or modification of the exchange of notes (Nos. 5 and 6) at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Jedda in regard to purchases of arms by the Saudi Government. [456 y—11 B 2i 4 r t S4R ANDREW RYAN reminded Fuad Bey that this matter had been discussed at the fourth meeting on the 5th July, when it had been agreed that it involved points of form, rather than of substance. He had now been able to go mto the question more deeply, in consultation with the competent Department u o- 6 ^ 0I Y 1 S n Office. There were two difficulties connected with the note written by sir O. Clayton at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda. That note leferred to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, and the reference implied certain qualifications of the assurance contained in it. That convention was now, however, dead, and a new agreement was in contemplation, which existed only m draft form. There would be no new regulation, Sir A. Ryan understood, providing for special zones, but, on the other hand, the question of possible restrictions on the supply of arms in abnormal circumstances had attracted increasing attention. It would be necessary to devise a new formula more in accordance with these developments than that embodied in the original note. xt’ explained that the position was that it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to qualify their assurance on the arms traffic in order to bring it into line with any existing or impending international commitments by which they might be bound, but that any such qualification would be one of purely general application. There would be no question of discrimination against Saudi Arabia as such. FUAD BEY thanked Sir Andrew Ryan and Mr. Rendel for the explanations they had given. He said that he had, however, been uneasy at hearing Mr. Rendel at the fourth meeting on the 5th July, state that His Majesty’s Government did not intend to treat the Saudi Government “in a less favourable way than any other friendly country in a similar position. ’ He thought that the expression m a similar position ’’ might imply discrimination. Mr. RENDER replied that he had been obliged to use the words quoted by Fuad Bey on^ account of the provisions in the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention establishing special zones ’’ in different parts of the world, within which the signatory countries bound themselves to sell arms only to Governments or their accredited agents, on account of the risk of any sale of arms to warlike and turbulent tribal elements leading to unrest and possible revolts. He realised that zones of this nature did imply a certain discrimination, but he pointed out that it was essentially in the interests of the Governments of countries within the zones that there should be a prohibition of the private import of arms and ammunition. He understood from Sir Andrew Ryan, who had been in touch with the experts on the subject at the Foreign Office, that it was unlikely that any future Arms Traffic Convention would contain provision for “special zones.” Nevertheless, he felt obliged to make a reservation on the point, as it was still possible that some alternative system might eventually be adopted by which certain groups or categories of countries should be subject to special regulations. He repeated, however, that there would be no question of discrimination against Saudi Arabia as such. FUAD BEY remarked that the Saudi Government were naturally more anxious than anybody else that arms should not be supplied illicitly to private individuals in their country. But they did not like any form of discrimination, and they could only agree to safeguards such as those underlying the idea of special zones ’ ’ if they were embodied in general terms applying to the world as a whole. After further discussion, SIR ANDREW RYAN undertook that as soon as a copy of the new draft Arms Traffic Convention had been obtained, he would try to work out a formula for embodying the original assurance of His Majesty’s Government in revised and up-to-date terms. V. Mr. RENDEL concluded the meeting by enquiring, with reference to the discussion at the fourth meeting on the 5th July, whether Fuad Bey was now in a position to make any statement about the recent conference between the delegates of Saudi Arabia and Koweit to discuss the problem of their mutual economic relations.LAD BEY replied that he had received a long communication from his Irovernment Unfortunately, however, its contents were not clear to him in all respects, and he regretted that he was not therefore in a position to make anv statement on the subject. J 'T J . ^ R '.drew Fuad Bey’s attention once more to the importance which His Majesty s Government and the Government of India attached to an early settlement of the present economic deadlock between the two countries He expressed the hope that every effort would be made to reach agreement on the basis of the proposal 8 of the Sheikh of Koweit, and that the Saudi Government would abandon their insistence on a guarantee that no single smuggler would be allowed to cross the border from Koweit into Saudi Arabia.

[E 4127/318/25] Record of Second Part of Third Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 2, 1935. THE first part of this meeting was devoted to further discussion of the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia and is recorded separately. The following were present for the second part of the meeting :— Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Ward. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi- Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi-Arabian Minister in London). At the end of the discussion on the frontier question, Mr. RENDEL enquired whether Fuad Bey Hamza desired to raise any particular questions for discussion at future meetings. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he was anxious to discuss the question of the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda. He thought that the opportunity should be taken to revise the treaty at the same time; for instance, the description of King Abdul Aziz in it as “ His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies ” required amendment. Mr. RENDEL explained that Fuad Bey need have no fear that the change in the title of King Abdul Aziz or of the Saudi Kingdom would affect the validity or authority of the treaty : there were numerous cases where the King of England was described by an obsolete title in treaties which were still binding on the United Kingdom. Turning to the question of the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda, Mr. Rendel pointed out that under article 8 it would continue in force indefinitely, unless and until denounced by either party. He felt sure that neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Saudi Government would wish to terminate the treaty, which constituted the basis of their present friendly relations with each other, unless there were some better and more up-to-date instrument to put in its place. There would therefore be no particular advantage in formally prolonging it— i.e., in the two parties binding themselves not to denounce it (since neither had any intention of doing so)—unless it were for the purpose of taking the opportunity to modify or abrogate some provision of the existing settlement. He understood that the main desire of the Saudi Government in making their present proposal was to secure the renunciation by His Majesty’s Government of their qualified right to manumit slaves, as set out in the relevant exchange of notes effected at the time of the signature of the main treaty. FUAD BEY did not dissent from this analysis of the position. SIR ANDREW RYAN remarked that there were three possibilities :— {a) The present treaty could be allowed to go on until the ©uts-taTrdfn‘g'p6inJs at issue had been settled. (b) The present treaty could be formally prolonged, the opportunity being taken to make any necessary changes in its provisions. (c) Negotiations could be begun for a new treaty. He considered that if the second course was to be discussed it would be best to begin by trying to reach agreement on the question of slavery and the right of manumission. Mr. RENDEL observed that it was clearly to the common interest of both the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia to maintain their relations upon a firm and durable basis, and it was only a question of the method by which this should 8025—1 [11839—2]be effected. He doubted whether much would be gained by arranging for the specific prolongation of the treaty until the main questions at issue had been amicably settled, when, no doubt, a new treaty covering all the ground and in closer harmony with the existing position could be negotiated. But if the present treaty were to be formally prolonged and the right of manumission abandoned as part of the arrangement, it would be necessary in first place, as Sir A. Byan had pointed out, to reach a clear understanding on the question of slavery. He pointed out that the abandonment of the right of manumission was a very delicate matter on account of the keen interest taken in the question of slavery by large sections of public opinion in Great Britain. His Majesty’s Government had, however, undertaken in the relevant exchange of notes to consider the surrender of this right if certain conditions were fulfilled; and if they could show that those conditions were now fulfilled and that a real improvement had been brought about in the general lot of slaves in Arabia, they would be in a position to justify their action before public opinion. Until this state of affairs came into being, there could be no question of His Majesty’s Government agreeing to surrender the right of manumission. The present position was that Fuad Bey had communicated privately to Sir A. Ryan certain draft Saudi regulations designed to prevent trade in slaves and to ameliorate the condition of existing slaves. These regulations would require to be completed and strengthened in certain particulars before they could be regarded by His Majesty’s Government as justifying the proposed concession, and he suggested that it would be most useful if Fuad Bey and Sir A. Ryan could now discuss the draft regulations together in detail, with a view to the Saudi Government making definite proposals on the subject. FUAD BEY agreed to this course and a meeting was accordingly arranged between him and Sir A. Ryan for the morning of the 3rd July.

The King had originally intended to receive the Amir Saud in formal audience on 25th June, but owing to His Majesty’s indisposition the audience was postponed until 29th June* The Amir had, however, an opportunity of meeting The Queen and members of the Royal Family on 20th June, when he visited the races at Ascot where he took luncheon with Her Majesty and the Royal Party and subsequently watched the races from the Household stand. Hi© Royal Highness, accompanied by Fuad Bey Hamsa end an Aide d© camp also attended the Third Court at Buckingham Palace on 25th June and stood upon the Royal Dais in the Ballroom. 6.

It was finally decided that th© ord&amp;r of the British Empire would be most suitable* and the Grand Cross of that Order (Military Division) was bestowed on the Amir gaud on 1st July.

Unfortunately, as a result \ of the previous visits to Italy, France, Holland and Belgium, tae Amir was already tired on his arrival In this country, and in order to spare his health a number of engagements and projected visits had to he cancelled.

Advantage has however bee taken of the presence in this country with H. .H. of Fuad Bey Hamza, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the informal discussion of various questions outstanding between His M^jestry*s Government and the Government of Saudi Arabia. Relations between this country and Saudi Arabia are at present governed by the Treaty of Jedda, which was signed on May 20, 1927. Since September 1954 this Treaty has been denunciable by either party at six months notice. While there is no reason to anticipate that either side mill denounce the freaty, the question of placing the relations bwfeween this country and Saudi Arabia on a more permanent basis has formed the subject of consideration and discussion. There are also certain points awaiting settlement regarding frontier relations in south-eastern Arabia and the opportunity has been taken to review these also. It Is not expected that these conversations will lead to the immediate conclusion of any new formal agreement* FOREIGN OFFICE 6th July, 1935.HIS MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND VISIT OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE AMIR SAUD, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA 17th JUNE to 1st JULY, 1935Evening Dine privately PROGRAMME Afternoon Monday, 17th June. 1.15 Arrive Dover.

His Royal Highness the Amir Saud, eldest surviving son and Heir Apparent oi King ibn Saud, arrived in London today, June 17th accompanied by Puad Bey Hamza, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia, and a small suite. His Royal Highness is being entertained for a fortnight as the guest of His Majesty's Government at the Hyde Park Hotel. He has already visited Italy, Prance and Holland. 2. The Amir Saud was born of a lady springing from the same family stock as King Ibn Saud himself; and is 52 years old. His Royal Highness resembles his father in physique am appearance and is reported to have inherited from him much charm of manner together with a deeply religious nature. He has for some years been his father's Viceroy in Nejd, the desert province dotted with fertile oases in central and eastern Arabia which is the homeland of the Saudi dynasty and of the Wahabi or puritan sect of the Islamic religion, and contains Riyadh, the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 1953 he was formally designated heir to the throne and received the homage of the representatives of the tribes and all other classes of the Saudi Kingdom. 3. The Amir has spent most of his life in Nejd and previously to his present tour he has only once been outside Arabia, when he paid a short visit to Egypt in 1926 to con sult an oculist. In 1934 he was, however, appointed Com- mander-in-Chief or King Ibn Saud's forces in the war with the Yemen in south-west Arabia, and he personally led one of the....the columns of the Saudi army. He was present at the recent attempt on the life of King Ibn Saud within the precincts of the Great Mosque at Mecca, and was himself wounded oy a dagger while thrusting aside an assailant who was about to attack the King. 4. A full programme of entertainment has been ar ranged for the Amir during the period of official hos pitality. At the end of this period, the Amir will be remaining in the United Kingdom for a further fortnight or three weeks, and will visit the three Service Reviews. EASTERN DEPARTMENT. 17th June, 1935.BIOG-RAPHICAL NOTE ON FUAD BEY HAMZA . DEPUTY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA . A Syrian from the Lebanon, about 56 years of age, who studied first in Syria and later at the School of Law in Jerusalem* He was employed under the Government of Palestine between 1921 and 1926 mainly as a school teacher teaching English. In September 1926 he resigned on the alleged ground that he had not been given adequate preferment. He had a generally good record in his various posts in Palestine, but was closely associated with Pan-Arab nationalists. He left Palestine for Egypt in November 1926, just about the time of the arrest of one of these, and apparently intended to proceed to India on behalf of a nationalist group, but got into touch with Ibn Saud and went to the Hejaz instead. He soon secured employ ment in the Hejazi Foreign Office. He rose rapidly and became in due course Acting Director of Foreign Affairs and got the whole work of the department, which had otherwise no proper organisation, into his own hands. He became Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs in December 1950, when the Emir Feisal was made titular Minister. This produced no effective change in Fuad Bey*s position. Under a constitutional reorganisation in 1952, the post held by Fuad Bey was defined as being that of 'Vekil' for Foreign Affairs with a seat in the newly created Council of Ministers, while the Emir Feisal retained the nominal position of Minister for Foreign Affairs in addition to his other dignities. Fuad Bey has recently described himself as M Deputy Minister”, and when in Saudi Arabia discharges all the active&amp;active work of the Department for practical purposes. Fuad Bey’s influence with the King has varied. He is one of the two principal members of the Syrian element in Ibn Sand’s entourage and has to cope with the rivalry of other advisers, such as the Saudi Minister in London, who is hostile to him, and the powerful Minister of Finance. He is very industrious, genuinely devoted to the Arab cause, as now incarnated in Ibn Saud, and of good personal character. He has an excellent knowledge of English, especially for official purposes. This is his third visit to Europe since 1932. EASTERN DEPARTMENT. 17th June, 1935.Ncles. Minute Paper. Register No. p.z SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Rec. 193 Date. Initials. SUBJECT.

Ryan’s telegrams of 2.2nd January now submitted.. Tbe Saudis have been rather more forthcoming than we anticipated about Bahrein transit dues (on which they now seem disposed to agree to a local conference at Bahrein to discuss the difficulties which have arisen - a proposal to which they did not react very favourably in the past) and about the Koweit blockade (on which they are apparently prepared to envisage discussions and in connection with which they have not raised the question of the Sheikh’s claims, which have hitherto been an obstacle to the initiation of such discussions). Their general attitude on the quest ion/a question whether the negotiations shall be comprehensive or piecemeal is not perhaps of much importance. They do not seem to feel strongly either way. Fuad that H.M.G. 'contemplated only moderate concessions' 1 . There is nothing in the suggestion put forward by Fuad, no doubt for debating reasons, that by undertaking to koop a acmo recognition of Arab independence, can in any way be regarded as compromising themselves in regard to the States in Arabia with which they are in special treaty relations cnrer the areas to the east of the Blue Line, and this was made clear by the Minister. But we must carefully watch any disposition on the part of the Saudis (there were hints of this during Fuad’s discussions here in the summer) to make important concessions to 'their Arab brethren' in * ^ ^ direct correspondence. Save in the case of Muscat, which is not likely to be materially affected by the conversations now in progress, we control the foreign relations of these Arab sheikhs and it is hnportant to interpret their obligations to us in this respect strictly if we wish to keep them from being drawn into the orbit of Ibn Saud. 3. on the whole, the opening conversations have passed off fairly well, but it remains to be seen whether this relatively smooth progress will be maintained. The invitation to Riyadh seems to have dropped into the background. a As regards the Blue Line, sir A- Ryan has warned i cal 18 FEB 1935 2*. » ■In any further communication on this subject, please quote N &lt;&gt; fiA* V V&amp;Yv?. and address —not to any person by name, but to— ‘ r “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. % 728 it ^ THE Under-Secretary of State ifor Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to 'OLu, ^3^—^*-1 IfctXsL and, by direction of the Secretary of State, # transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper. / C 7 4 &lt;3&gt; ' Foreign Office, , 193 S .

While His Majesty’s Government recognise the r.raeticel difficulty of obtaining cash payments irom iring Ibn Saud, it seem to them lunortant to keen the question of these debts alive. If King Xbn Gaud is made to understand that His ^ajeoty 1 © G-ovornuait attach importance to that question, it may be that, even if early recovery of the debts ^rovea to bo impracticable, it will prove possible to secure ^ 3 cuc concrete concession in return for a further postponement* If, on the other hand, the question is dropped, he may be inclined to attribute less importance to it and it *ili in consequence lose any value oven as a negotiating counter* 4.

Sir A. Ryan, (Jedda) 22nd January, 1935I gave a definite official turn to the second conversation. I asked whether the Saudi Government as such were ready to accept proposal which His Majesty 1 s Government had indeed approved for comprehensive negotiations on the lines suggested in London last September and whether they would produce precise statement of Ibn Sand's desiderata regarding boundaries. I added that if com prehensive negotiations produced no result the parties could only return to their positions in regard to legal question and expressed the hope that any statement of desiderata would be such as to provide for reasonable border discussion as His Majesty’s Government contemplated only moderate concessions« I said that I was making these observations under instructions. Fuad inconveniently postponed his reply* Nothing was said about invitation to Riadh* My general impression is that Saudi Government attach little importance to distinction between comprehensive negotiations and alternative of dealing with every question on its merits.

I think that Fuad's attitude would make it possible to make a new start and combine (a) and (b) above in a single statement of His Majesty’s Government's views. It would naturally be better if claims question were ..out of the way but if Sheikh resists this it might be possible in the present circumstances to ignore that question in any official statement and if questioned to inform Saudi Government orally that His Majesty's Government so far as they are concerned would not pursue question of claims or use it as a means of pressure.

Your telegram No. 8, - Many thanks for those instructions which will certainly enable rne to conduct first round with Fuad although I must study paragraphs 3 to 11 more closely before I can suomit rwofft '-by-1o4ogr^p^' of any ^observations on them. Meanwhile I submit following points in anticipation of first conversa tions with Fuad who reached Mecca only yesterday and has not yet proposed a meeting. A. I am now disinclined to go to Riadh in the near future even if Fuad brings an Invitation which latest indications make me think doubtful. Apart from reasons of practical inconvenience which have some weight but are not imperative I see increasing political objections to an early visit. I do not expect Fuad to pursue his impossible cvXax suggestion that negotiations should take place at Riadh but impression is widespread that such negotiations are impending especially in view of position as regards Treaty of Jedda. This being so my return without having come to any definite agreement might be misinterpreted locally and in Arab and Egyptian press. Moreover King feels so strongly over blue line question that it would be better to confine myself to conversations with Fuad as long as possible. I propose therefore unless you see strong objection to side-track * * •side-track any invitation if I can do so without risk of offence hut to intimate that invitation next summer would he welcome* I shall of course see the King here in the interval. B. What maps are you using and what maps should I use in discussion with Fuad? Map Department of the Foreign Office has, I think, list of maps available here* Further supply hy hag of those to he used would he useful* C* I appreciate effects of distinction drawn between personal and territorial sovereignty hut I am not clear as to how distinction should he defined juridically if necessity arises* May I have information on this subject not necessarily hy telegraph if explanation is lengthy?

Questions of Koweit blockade (my telegram No. 7 /of the 12th January/) ? of Bahrein transit dues (Government of India semi official letter of the 24th December to India Office), and of Saudi-TransJordan frontier are still under consideration but instructions will follow as soon as possible. 4. Slavery. Instructions were sent to you in my despatch Mo. 452 (of the 15th December), but further instructions will follow as soon as possible on points raised in your telegram No. 4 (of January 15). 5. South-eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia. After con sideration of views of political authorities in the Persian Gulf and Government of India His Majesty's Government suggest following programme for negotiations with Saudi Government. Concessions in each case are intended to form part of general settlement. 6. First stage. Request for clearer indication of King Ibn Saud’s desiderata. If the King merely repeats his claim to the whole of- the desert except for the coastal belt, he might be told that so vague and extensive a claim to so vast an area, to which His Majesty’s Government do not recognise him as possessingpossessing any valid title, can form no basis for discussion, and that while His Majesty’s Government ax:e prepared to make some friendly concession this can only be within reasonable^- limits. 7. In any preliminary conversation with Ibn Sand you may not wish to proceed beyond this? stage. But I fully realise the difficulties with which you may be faced and I do not desire to tie your hands unduly. nactcr is mainly one of tactics, as to which you are'necessarily the best judge, and you are there fore authorised, if you consider that no settlement is likely to be attainable otherwise, to proceed, either with the King at Riyadh, or subsequently with Fuad Hamza, as and when you con sider it necessary or desirable, to -either of the further stages suggested in paragraphs 8 and 9 below. 8. Second stage. Offer to concede to Ibn Baud in full sovereignty a relatively small area ox* strip immediately to the east of the Blue Line as far as a line running from the head of the Dohat-es-rSalwa to a point slightly sout-east of Sakak (but leaving that place to Saudi hrabia), then.ee, (leaving to Qatar and Abu Dhabi a strip of territory extending inland for not less than 25'miles to. the vest of the head cf the ■Khcr^elr-Odeid) to the ncsrtlv-weste^tr•extremity of Aqal, thence due southwards via.(but tie-the west of) Banaiyan to Parallel , whence it would • * * • •' . * -■ _ . . gradually rejoin the Violet Line. '9. .Jf this offer proves insufficient, gis Majesty's Govern-- ment would prepared to consider in addition to it, as. a third stage, a settlement on the lines suggested in Mr. Rendel's - letter of November 7th to Mr. Laithwaite (copy in my despatch No. 456 /of November SStlyO, involving creation of a desert zonezone under a special regime, for a period of ten or twenty years, subject to reconsideration at the request of either party at the end of that time. (See also conclusion 1 of Middle East Sub-Committee meeting of November 8). Ibn Saud would maintain in this zone any personal rights which he at present effectively exercises over the nomadic tribes there e.g. the right to levy zakat but would not possess territorial sovereignty and would therefore not be able to grant concessions. The desert zone and special regime would be defined by a separate agreement. The boundaries of the desert zone would be approximately those suggested in Mr. Rondel's letter but would exclude Banaiyan. 10. If you are eventually convinced that no satisfactory general settlement can be reached on the basis even of this con cession, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared in the last resort, and in order to secure their desiderata in other directions, to concede to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty a part at least of the desert area referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, subject however to the servitude that no concessions would be granted therein by Ibn Saud except after consultation with His Majesty’s Government and to concessionaires approved both by His Majesty's Government and by the Saudi Government. Precise limits to be suggested for this additional area are still under consideration and further instructions on this point will reach you as soon as possible. Idea at present being explored is that the part of the proposed desert zone lying to the west of Meridian 52 might possibly be thus conceded to Ibn Saud. South end of this line would appear to join ’’ring fence” line approximately at the northern end of the boundary between the Aden Protectorate and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, assuming latter to run inland from Ras Dharbat Ali at rightVv 1 4. right angles to the coast. 11. In any case however it will he important to obtain from Ibn Baud a categorical renunciation of any rights, or claim to any kind of sovereignty outside the frontier line suggested in pairgraphs outside the 'ring fence' of the desert zone (see paragraph 5 of Hr. Rendel’s letter to Mr. Laithwaite). It would also be desirable for His Majesty's Government to retain flying rights not only over the desert zone hut also over any area which might eventually he conceded to Ion Sana under to paragraph 12. You will no doubt in any negotiations make suen use as you can of fact that any of these concessions would involve acquisition by Ibn Sand of rights over very large areas to which he has at present no legal claim, and would release him from obligations of existing 'Blue Line' frontier, from which he could not otherwise escape without the greatest difficulty. 15. If you see any objection to any part of aDo\e piogramme I shall be glad to consider any observations you wish to offer. I trust however that present telegram will at any rate give you sufficient idea of general desiderata of His Majesty's Government to enable you to conduct preliminary discussions with King Ibn Sand at Riyadh if you proceed thither, or with Fuad Hamza. 14. Instructions on such points as landing grounds and flying rights, Saudi Government's debts, etc., will follow by despatch as soon as possible. Addressed to Jedda ho. 8.

Other prominent correspondents include the following: the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires to Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert, succeeded by Alan Charles Trott); His Majesty's Ambassador in Baghdad (Sir Kinahan Cornwallis); Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd]; Amir Faisal [Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd], Minister of Foreign Affairs for Saudi Arabia; officials of the Colonial Office and the War Office.The correspondence documents the progression of negotiations for a general settlement between the two governments, which would result in the initial prolongation of the validity of the Treaty of Jedda (the treaty signed between Britain and Ibn Saud in 1927, which initially expired in September 1934) for a period of seven years from 1936 (and for another seven years from 1943).In addition to discussing matters relating to the proposed general settlement (e.g. the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia, slavery regulations, arms traffic, and Saudi debts), the correspondence also documents various visits and meetings, including the following:The visit of Amir Saud [Āl Sa‘ūd, Sa‘ūd bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz, heir apparent of Ibn Saud] to Britain (17 June-1 July 1935), accompanied by Fuad Bey Hamza, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for Saudi Arabia.Further meetings at the Foreign Office between Fuad Bey Hamza, Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Minister in London), Sir Andrew Ryan, George William Rendel (Head of the Foreign Office's Eastern Department), and other Foreign Office officials, in July 1935, following on from meetings in September 1934.Sir Andrew Ryan's meetings with Ibn Saud in Riyadh in December 1935 and in Jedda in February 1936.Four interviews held between Ibn Saud, Sir Reader William Bullard and George William Rendel, in Jedda, during March 1937.Also discussed are matters relating to the Second World War, including:An exchange of letters between Ibn Saud and the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, in early 1939, which principally relate to Ibn Saud's concerns regarding his country's security in the event of the beginning of general hostilities.German radio broadcasts in Jedda during the first few weeks of the Second World War and their possible effect on the Jedda population.The possibility of Iraq and Saudi Arabia formally joining the Allies in the Second World War.In addition to correspondence the file includes the following: a copy of a programme for Amir Saud's visit to Britain (ff 339-348); exchanges of notes (in English and Arabic) between the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British Legation at Jedda, confirming the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda, dated 1936 and 1943 respectively (ff 189-192 and ff 4-5); a sketch map showing air routes over Saudi Arabia and Iraq (f 31v).Although the material in this file falls inside the date range of 1935-1943, the final document in the file does include an additional date stamp which is marked '12 April 1947'.The file includes two dividers which give a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. These are placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaty of Jeddah (1927)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Prime Minister</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia Sa'ūd bin 'Abd al-'Azīz Āl Sa'ūd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Slavery</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Debts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><subject><topic>War propaganda</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomatic service</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000272#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
