The Resident expresses his gratitude for the intelligence he has been receiving from Bussora [Basra] and hopes communication with Europe will become more regular now that peace has been established between the Porte and Britain. It also outlines the Resident's suspicion that the French are seeking an alliance with Persia against the British.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x0000b9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
