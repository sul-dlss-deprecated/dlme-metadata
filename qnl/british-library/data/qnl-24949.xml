No. PZ.7938/39, regarding increases in the freight and passage rates in the Indian Coastal and Persian Gulf trades. The Minister is informed by the British India Steam Navigation Company that although the revised Schedule of Rates has not yet been received from India, it is understood that the increases amount to from 40$*&gt; to 50 /j of the pre-war rates. ‘ The Company state that the v/ages of Indian crews have increased by 4Q?h and that bunker coal prices, particularly at outports, and oil prices have risen very considerably, and that special route instructions entailing longer steaming distances were introduced in Indian and adjacent waters on the outbreak of hostilities. War risk money is also paid in the case of personnel on the same scale as personnel from the United Kingdom. As a measure of prudence it was necessary for the Company to insure the vessels against war risks at rates which were notvery much less than those applicable to ships trading to the United Kingdom - in fact, it is not possible to cover insurance against war risks under the Government Scheme at a * lower rate than for vessels trading to and from this country. It is further understood that the extra cost of repairs arising from war conditions, and of material, deck and engine stores and provisions shipped from this country, is also a contributory factor to the large increase in the operating costs of vessels which are based on India. I wmim state that the Minister does not consider, in view of the foregoing considerations, that he would be justified in representing to the Company that the rates mentioned should I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, be reduced'9 FILE COPY Telefram*—•* SHIPMINDER, WESDO, LONDON.” Telephone—ABBEY 7711.

Since the Government of India, vide their Express Letter No. F. 18-F/36 of 28th August, are not in a position to compel the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers to call at Jiuni, presumably these steamers will not call there. This being so the Indian merchants of Gwaaur (see panugraph 5 of my Express Letter No. 151Q/56/2 of 20th July) will stay where they are. The position, therefore, from the view of the Muscat State is not so serio u a . 3.

ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No 1 6 '2 W. j Detect 1 3Copy of a letter No. 266 dated the 13th January 1936 from the Political Agent in Kalat and Chagai to the Secretary to the Hobble the Agent tc the G-ovemor- General in Baluchistan, Sibi. I have the honour to report that I have recently received a request from the Wazir-i-Azam, Kalat State, for the assistance of the Grovemment of India in compelling the British India Steam Navigation Company to arrange for their steamers to make fortnightly calls at Jiuni port. 2. Jiuni is situated to the east of Gwattar Bay and is admirably located as a port for the valley of the Dasht river. It is also well placed as an export base for the fishing industry of the western section of the Mekran coast, and for trade with south east Persian Mekran. At the present moment the whole of this trade passes through Gwadur, which is a Muscat possession, and which has for many years, by reason of its favourable position, drawn considerable revenues from trade passing to, from and through Kalat territory. For reasons into which it is unnecessary to enter, the majority of the Indian traders in Gwadur are anxious to move to Jiuni, but it is obviously impossible for them to carry on business in Jiuni unless and until arrangements have been made for regular steamer service to that port. 3. On various occasions efforts have been made to ±kix± induce the British India Steam Navigation Company to arrange calls at Jiuni, but hitherto that company has declined to consider the proposal on the ground that 'No advantage would accrue to them by making a regular call at that port'. While it may be freely admitted that the establishment of Jiuni as a port of call for steamers would not appreciably increase the total volume of trade on this coast and would, in fact, do little more than divert a considerable proportion of the Gwadur trade to Jiuni, it remains a fact that the British India Steam /NavigationNavigation company have used their monopoly of the carrying trade along the Mekran coast and the Persian Gulf to the detriment of an Indian State under the protection of the Government of India, and to the equal disadvantage both of the traders and of the fishermen and other producers living in Kalat State, whose goods they carry and whose merchandise must now perforce pay both Muscat and Kalat dues. The State authorities have therefore explored the possibility of compelling the company to make a call at Jiuni and they report that according to their information the Government of India are in a position to compel the British Indian Steam Navigation Company to call at any port for the purpose of delivering and collecting mails. If this information is correct and if the Government of India are prepared to use this power the State authorities on their part are ready immediately to guarantee the Posts and Telegraphs Department against any loss on their establishing a combined office at Jiuni and they have in fact already made this offer to the Director of Posts and Telegraphs at Karachi. They are at the same time prepared to expend funds on the improvement of Jiuni as a port. They therefore request that the Government of India be moved to intervene on their behalf, and in exercise of the authority residing with them to direct the British India Steam Navigation Company to make fortnightly calls at Jiuni on both the inward and outward voyages. This request I most strongly support since it seems clear that a State under the protection of the Government of India is entitled to claim their sympathy in the development of its own trade, the revenues from much of which have in the past been diverted to an alien State solely owing to the obstructive attitude of a monopoly-owning Company. 4. I should add that it is only with reluctance that the State authorities have decided to solicit the aid of the Government of India, and they have in fact explored various other means of compelling the company in their own interests to call there, before falling back /on(SiD on this final expedient. Efforts have, for instance, been made to interest Imperial Airways in Jiuni as an alter native aerodrome to Gwadur and indeed such are its advantages that these efforts would probably have succeeded but for the decision to exchange from land-planes to sea-planes in the near future. Unfortunately for Kalat State sl the T-shaped headland at Gwadur provides a sea plane harbour with which neither Jiuni nor any other port on this coast can compete in safety or all-weather utility. &gt; ^■35 EXPRESS LETTER. ?rom Resident, Bushire.

Request by the Kalat State for compelling British India Steam Navigation Jomoany to arrange for their ateaiaefo to make lort- British India Steam Navigation jomoany t ammg® for their steamers to make'iort- ni^itly calls at Jiuni port. Reference your memorandum No. F.18-P/36 dated the 20th February 1936 and my memorandum No. 1011 dated the 16th May explaining that the matter was under correspondence with the Political Agent, Muscat, and that a report will be submitted as soon as the latter had given the details. These details have now been received and I am in a position to reply as follows t- 2. In paragraph 3 of Political Agent, Kalat 1 s letter No. 266 dated the 13th January, it is stated that in the opinion of the Kalat State the Government of India are in a position to compel the British India Steam Navigation Com pany to call at any port for the purpose of delivering and collecting mails. I shall be glad to Know if this assumption, which is an important factor in the question under review, is correct or not. Assuming it to be correct then if a Post Office is opened at Jiuni (marked Jiunri on some maps) the Government of India o&amp;n compel the British India Steam Navigation Company to call there. If the assumption is not correct then the British India Steam Navigation Company will presumably make their decision as to whether call at Jiuni or not on purely commercial grounds. 3. Even if the assumption of the Kalat State is correct, I venture to think that the Government of India, in making their decision, will, doubtless, considi /the • • • •the interest of the Muscat State as much as that of Kalat. It is true that technically speaking the Sultan of Muscat is an independent sovereign, and that Xalat is a state under the Grovemment of India, but at the same time to many intents and purposes the Muscat State is also under the protection of the Government of India, who have in the past corae to its assistance on many occasions in various ways - financial and otherwise, 4, Major Watts is of the opinion that if the British Indian community in Gwadur were to migrate to Jiuni ( vide Paragraph 2 of Political Agent, Kalat's letter referred to), and if that port were made a call for British India steamers, there will be a heavy fall in the import trade and therefore of the customs revenues of Gwadur, and con sequently of the Muscat Stats, (The proportion of the trade of Gwadur to the total of the Muscat trade is approximately 20% and that of the transit trade of Gwadur to the total trade of Gwadur is 8C$). I qiite concur in Major Watts’ opinion, arid in this connf jtion the Government of India will remember that only recently the Muscat State, after many years of semi-bankruptcy, has at last become solvent. It is hardly necessary for me to point out that it would be most unfortunate if by reason of its loss in Gwadur revenue the State v/ere once more plunged in financial difficulties, 5, I recognise nevertheless that there is force in the complaint of •foe Kalat State that goods entering that State through Gwadur though only in transit ha ye to pay a double duty, first to the Muscat State and then to Kalat. Major Watts points out that until recently when the duty in both states was low (the actual duty in each case being 5&amp;) the double duty was not of great conse quence, In 1934, however, when the Muscat Government (with the permission of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India) raised its duties on numerous arti cles to 10% the situation was altered, and at the present moment the merchants of Gwadur are complaining that their export trade with the hinterland has fallen off considerably. Major Watts further confims the statement of the Kalat State (referred to in paragraph 4 above) /that,««••••.,that the more enterprising British Indian merchants of Gwadur, in whose hands practically the whole trade of Gwadur lies, declare their readiness to move to Jiuni directly arrangements have been made for steamers to call at that port. 6. The best solution of the problem seems to me for the luscat State to reduce their duties on Gwadur transit trade. This reduction cannot, however, be made without the personal sanction of, and discussion with, the Sultan who is, as the Government of India are aware, absent in Ghofar and from which place he cannot return, now that the monsoon has set in, until October. I propose, therefore, subject to the sanction of the Government of India, which I will be glad to receive as early as possible, to send him through the Political agent, Muscat, the conmunication attached. In this connection please see ray letter No. 133-S of 17th February 1936. Resident The Issue cf the above has been authorised. Sd/- Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf./ 3 From Q$)\ The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian (Jalf. To Ris Highness the Sultan of Muscat. After compliments: I have the honour to inform your Highness of the following aituation which has arisen. The ha id. t otate have approached the Government of xia wi-'tn a request tnat a postal and telegraphic office should he opened at Jiuni (Jiunri) in their territory and that arrangements should be made for B.I.S.N. steamers to call there. The reason for this request is that goods in transit for Kalat via G-wadur have to pay a double duty, that of your Government and that of the Kalat State. These duties have recently been raised by Your Highness irom o to 10/o. The Kalat State affirms, and Major Watts confirms this, that British Indian merchants in Gwadur, in whose hands, as Your Higjhness is aware, most of the trade lies, are prepared, if B.I. steamers call at Jiuni, v -eave hvadur and proceed there* If this were to occur, Major Watts is of opinion that the Gwadur customs revenues of your State would suffer severely. I agree in this opinion. Government of India are, as Your Hig^iness is aware, always ready to protect your interests, but in the present instance they find it extremely difficult to do so owing to your absence in Ohofar. They are of the opinion tnat this matter can only oe satisfactorily settled by personal discussion between the Political Agent, myself and Your Highness. They are willing to postpone any action in the matter until next October, but if four Highness by that time has not returned to iuscat they will be compelled to take such action as they see fit, in your absence*I have nn various occasions (please see my letter, for instance, of 4th March 1933) explained to Your Highness that should anything untoward in the State happen by reason of Your Higjiness* absence, it would of course be '/our Highness* responsibility and in no way mine or my Crovenment’s. I must again repeat this warning in connection with this matter.

La st .er &amp; ^ieanitioiL-C o iapajiy.-LB om bayi - As the result of complaints voiced by the local papers and Basra merchants against excessive freight charged by the British India Steam Navigation Company for grain and dates shipments to India, Abdul Jabbar Khadery, owner of a number of river going steamers and barges arranged during the beginning of the date season this year, with the Eastern Steam Navigation Company of Bombay to send out three steamers every month for a period of 4 months i.e., September to December. The main idea was to force the British India Steam Navigation Company to reduce their freight. The freight charged for shipments by these steamers is Rs.B/- per ton delivered at dock whereas the British India Steam Navigation Company were charging Rs.il/- per ton delivered midstream. This arrangement has induced the British India Steam Navigation Company to reduce freight temporarily to Rs.5/- per ton, as also to have the cargo shipped by their steamers cleared through port and customs in their name, as a number of Basra shippers are bound by contract by iibdul Jabbar Khadery to ship only by steamers of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company.5 ./ Both these lines of steamers are getting full freight 'i though with loss to the British India dteam Navigation Company, who, when addressed by Basra merchants and shippers on the subject in the beginning of this year, refused to consider a reduction of their charges. Foreign Lines . 1. Hansa Line . agents in Iraq: Messrs. African and Eastern (Near East) Limited. This line maintains what is practically a monthly service with Basra to and from main continental ports, i.e. Bremen, Hamburg, Antwerp and Amsterdam, supplemented by additional steamers when inducement offers, as during the date season. They also take cargo for ports en route. Vessels sometimes proceed to Indian ports to load when sufficient cargo is not available in Basra. A limited number of passengers are carried. 2. Lloyd Tri estino . Agents in Iraq: Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited. A bi-monthly service between Trieste and Basra, calling at other ports en route (see Mr.Hurst f s despatch Overseas Trade No.1 oi the 31st January 1934). Mainly freight, but a limited number of passengers can be carried. 3. Japanese Lines . Ships of the famashita hisen Kabushiki Kaisha (agents, Frank C. Strick and Company) have latterly been arriving at Basra ±rom «japan via Indian porta and the Persian Gulf at intervals of two months. These vessels bring to Iraq mainly cement and piece goods; the only exports so far have been scrap iron and a part cargo of salt loaded at Fao. . ! The Nippon Yusen Kaisha and the Osaka Jhosen Kaishaj contemplate co-operating in opposition to this service. 4. Greek Vessels . Calls are maae at irregular intervals by ships bringing timber and date-box shocks irom Black 3ea ports. They load at Basra dates, grain, etc., tor Red oea ports.5. soviet Vessels no longer call at Basra, the last one to do so having been the s.s. 'oamoed' on the 14th August 1933* Imports from Joviet Russia consisted principally of timber and piece goods, and, the date season apart, outward cargoes from Basra were very restricted. The difficulty of finding return freights, restrictions on Russian imports into Persia and the fact that it has proved cheaper to charter Greek tonnage, have combined in determining the abandonment of this service. Cargoes from Black Bea ports are now commonly transhipped at Port Said into steamers of the Strick and Ellerman lines. 6. Swedish Vessels . Messrs.haji Jathabhai Gokal of Basra had proposed to get out Swedish steamers to compete with the Strick and Ellerman lines, but have abandoned this idea. The contemplated Swedish line was the Swenska Ostasiatiska Company, ships of which had been calling at Bander Shapour in the Persian Gulf with a cargo of Swedish cement for the Persian Railways. Two of these steamers, s.s. 'Kippon' and s.s. 'Benares', called at Basra in July and September of this year respectively under the agency of Messrs, haji Jethabhai Gokal, and left with cargo for Djibouti and Saigon. Relative position of British ohicoing as rega rd? Iraq. British shipping handles at least 75/c of all seaborne traffic to and from Iraq. Foreign interests as represented by the hansa and Lloyd Triestino lines amount to perhaps another 20$, leaving 5$ to cover the trading done by the infrequent calls of Greek and other foreign vessels. Impending developments of Japanese shipping may slightly alter tnese totals in the near future. General Remarks . Competition between the regular lines is limited, as the various interests confine their activities, in/in general, to definite areas. Here again Japanese intervention may upset, more especially as regards the British India Steam Navigation Company trade, the existing equilibrium.mlmh Extracts from reports of proceedings of H.M of the Persian Gulf Division covering the period September to November Ships 19 ^ 2 . x 7 .

My 1323 12th October disappointment may have been allayed a little by mail steamer calling yesterday. 1 do not know actual terms of arrangement about steamer but people attach weight to expected facility of shipping freight from Karachi to Sharjah direct and not via Dibai. If this was in fact part of agreement it seems important to carry it out. Peeling among trading community was beginning to run fairly hign because aeroplanes were arriving and mail steamer was not.
