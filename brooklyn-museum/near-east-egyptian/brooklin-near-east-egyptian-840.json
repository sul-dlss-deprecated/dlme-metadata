The pose is free and suggests the naturalism of the period, Proto-dynastic probably of the 1st dynasty.\r\nCondition: The piece is in very bad condition. One front leg missing, part of one head leg and a considerable portion of one side missing. The piece has been assembled from many parts and there are many chips and cracks.", "medium": "Ivory", "dimensions": "1 1/4 x 2 3/16 in.
