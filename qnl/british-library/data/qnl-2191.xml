(Corresponding with 9th April 1907 A few days after Abdur Pezzak bin Salim*s arrival in Bombay from Ceylon he brought pearls for sale which were in his possession, but we could not settle the bargain with him, because the price he asked was exorbitant and the market had begun to decline. After that he asked us for 's. 4000/- mortgaging the pearls for a few days with us and we paid him 9th April p s. 4000/- on the 23th of Safar (corresponding with 9th April 1907. 1907by cheque on the National Bank for r s. 2,500/- and a cheque on the Bank of India for B s. 1,500/- in all P s. 4000/-. After a few days he asked as to go with him to Surat to Chhotalal Niganchand Co:, to sell the pearls to them. V/e went with him to Surat, but Chhotalal would not accept his terms. After returning from Surat, he asked us to hand over the pearls to Abdulla bin Iluhammadul Fouzau for sale, whom he asked to pay over the mortgage money to us. On Abdulla Fouzau agreeing to pay the above sum after the sale of pearls, we handed over the same to him. After some time he returned them (pearls') to ns stating that he could not 9th August sell them. On the 28th of -Tamadil Akhar (corresponding with 1907. 9th August 1907we informed Abdur Pezak bin Salim that ^s.lOOO % would be debited to his account and that this money was a sum which he had borrowed from my brother Ahmed, and we therefore added the same to the previous account of n s.4000/-, our claim thus amounting in all to 5000/-. 12th August 1907. On the 2nd of Rajab 1025 (corresponding with 12th August 1907') we in company with Abdul Pezak bin Salim started for Arabia. Me went to Frbi and Bahrein .and he went to No we it. He told us tnat we would take the pearls to Arabia, and in the event of the pearls not being sold for the amount purchased which was '3.15,000/- we would sell them for 9 to 10,000/- more or would less. If not, we/take them back to Bombay and then he would reuurn also in the season, wnen he would come to some arrange- ment with us. We then took the pearls to Arabia, where we got no purchaser and consequently brought them back to Bombay. On ourour arrival here, we waited Tor Abdur Pezal: bir Salim to .turn up expecting that he would come and mal:e arrangement about his property, when we heard of his death. T7e then waited for an order from Sheikh Mubarak bin Saleh and for him to let us know what share Abdur Bezak had in the property or whether the whole of the property belonged to him. 7he first letter re ceived from Sheikh Mubarak was dated 34th Moharrem 1526 27th February(corresponding with 27th February IdOS). He therein stated 19C8. that we should exert ourselves in selling this property be longing to Abdur Rezak bin Salim and it should be sold at the market rate. After the sale we should deduct our abovemen- tioned dues and the balance should be paid to Mohammed bin Salim Saderani who would distribute the sum amongst Abdur Rezak*s creditors in equal portion. Sheikh Mubarak being one of the creditors. 12th March 17e therefore on the Sth of Safar (corresponding with 12th 1908. March 1908) sent him a reply on these lines. The pearls be longing to Abdur Rezak bin Salim are not owing to the market being dull saleable in these days. The market being very low the price offered is half of the price that was offered last year. If we want to show them and to procure purchaser for to-day, they will fetch half of the price that was procurable for them last year, not even so much as to satisfy our claim, because the market rates of such pearls are at a standstill. With the Jrace of Mod and patience we may have better luck, then we might get a purchaser. Since receipt of your letter ^ we are endeavouring to sell the property. Previously we were ^ awaiting your orders, because we had left everything to you, but now we hope that everything will come right. 25th June 1908. On the 25th of Jamadil Awal ( corresponding with 25th June 19081 another letter was received from him (Sheikh Mubarak) stating that we in company with Mokbel Abdur Rahman Zakayar should dispose of the pearls belonging to Abdur Rezak bin Salim by auction. 9th July 1908. On the 9th of Jamadil Akhar (corresponding with 9th of July 19081 we replied that in the opinion of Mokbel Abdur Rahman Zakayar this property should not be sold by auction and that Sheikh Mubarak should send for them and dispose of themthem to pearl merchants in Arabia ^2) 25 cn -July 1908 A reply dated 25th Jamadil Akhar ( corresponding with 25th of July 19081 was received from Sheikh Hubarak in which 1908) we replied and said that this property belonged to a deceased person and its responsibility was great, because sending it by sea was dangerous and we would not accept the responsibility of the same. This property is in our possessioi and money is due to us on the same. We therefore asked him to write to some responsible person known to him and to us,to take charge of the pearls and. pay our dues so that there would be no occasion to send the pearls by sea. This would- be agreeable to both of us. ing with 17th September 19081 to the effect that we had asked him to send the pearls to Arabia, and that we had agreed that we would do so. Now we write That we will not be responsible for the same as it was dangerous to send the pearls by sea, and that we will not send them unless we obtain our dues. In that case our law does not permit us to take our dues from the property which belongs to a deceased person . Eecause the deceased person is in debt and the money he owes to people was obtained by him for the purchase of these pearls, and we -are one of those creditors. These pearls ought to be sold ing 2iim to take possession of the pearls and to sell them as he thinks proper. But this property is mortgaged to us. If the law orders us to that we are one of them, we will obey this order. The money in great difficulties. We paid the money on account of the great he stated that the property belonging to Abdur Pezak bin Salim should be sent to him 29th August 1908.

In accordance with religious law and Government law we have every right to dispose of this property by auction and to pay ourselves the money due to us. You are aware of the dullness of the pearl market. • lP'~h October On the 21st of Pamazan ( corresponding with 18th October 1008. loos') a letter was received from Sheikh Kobarak to this effect We did not know that this property was mortgaged to you. We therefore appoint Haji Mokbel Abdul Fahman Zakayar to take possession of the property, and sell the same,.and pay your dues, and that the balance should be paid to Hohammed bin Salim Sadrini. Me replied that we showed the property to Hokbel, who refused to take possession of it, and. asked us to show it to a purchaser .and inform him of the offer. Me showed it to a purchaser who offered ’s. SI/” P er chow the whole being 145 to 146 chow. Me informed Hai i Ilokbel of this offer. He asked us 21st November 1908. 13th October 1908. to inform the Sheikh. Me wrote to the Sheikh on the 26th Shawal ( corresponding with 21st November 1908&gt; to this effect. The reason of our - \ delay in writing to you was that we wanted to give you an exact account of the case. That on receipt of your letter dated 21st of Pamazan (corresponding with 18th of October 1908) we showed the property to Hokbel Abdul Fahman Zakayar and ask- him to take the possession of the property and sell the same. He replied that we should get a purchaser and let him know his offer. Me showed the pearls to a purchaser who offered k.36/- per chow and then informed Haji Hokbel of this offer and asked his permission to sell the same. He replied that he could not do so until he consulted Sheikh Hobarak. Sd: Hohamed bin Abdul Wahab ab HashariIConfidential• Sir, of 1909. '3^1 British Residency and Consulate-General.

I forward herewith a statement showing the Bahrein and Koweit claims against Sheikh Ja sim bin Thani and the manner in which the Sheikh has settled them. I received this information from Musaad bin Kalifa. an Arab British subject who is generally well informed in such matters, but about the Koweit claims the information is also corroborated by Mr. Milborrow who has recent' ly returned from Abu Lhaluf on the North best Coast where Sheikh Jasim came down to meet him. S. There is a suspicion in Bahrein that the publicly reported settlement of the Koweit claims is not truly described and that in all probabili ty there has also been some secret arrangement under which Sheikh Jasim who was impressed by Sheikh Mobarak's threat to solicit our interven tion, may have handed over some pearls or cash in addition. 4. The Bahrein creditors, it will be seen from the statement, have come off even worse than thethe Koweitis, but they have made no attempt, either through their Chief or directly, to invoke British good offices on their behalf.■HI Sheikh Jasira bin Thani of Katar. » Payment in Kind Remarks Refused to accept Sheikh Ja- sim f s terms and the claim still remains unsettled.

It lists each civil case according to the name of the claimant and the nature of their claim, together with the folio reference (described as the ‘page’ reference) on which the case papers begin. The folio reference given in the table of contents belongs to a superseded foliation sequence, which is written in pencil, but not circled. Each set of case papers appear in the file in chronological order, based on the commencement date of the claim. Within each individual case record, the claim papers are also arranged in approximate chronological order.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 301; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. An additional irregular foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 8-300; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled, and are at times crossed out. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains case correspondence, including several witness statements and a record of hearing proceedings held at the British Political Agency in Kuwait. These case papers relate to the investigation and resolution of 27 individual claims that were submitted to the Political Agent, Kuwait by resident British Indian subjects, merchants in India and others. The majority of claims concern either the non-payment of debts, goods or services, or land and property rights. The correspondence is mainly between the Political Agent at Kuwait and the individual claimants and defendants in each case. There are several letters, statements and notes in Arabic, two statements of account in Persian relating to goods purchased on credit, one letter of claim in French and one short note in Tamil.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Administration of Justice</topic></subject><subject><topic>Debts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
