( k r &gt; 7 tC ^ r 5« The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited . (i) Labour ^ On the ifth of January Mr, Ward P. Anderson the General Manager of the — .^lirain Petroleum Company informed the Political Agent that he had ward disquieting rumours which indicated that there was a possibility of a strike of local labour at the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Careful enquiries were made but no confirmation whatsoever was obtained of the intention of the local employees of the Canpany to indulge in such co-ercive action. It was apparent that the transportation arrangements for the carriage of unskilled labour to and fran their employment were unsatisfactory and the General Manager took such action as lay within his power to remedy defects in the system. Unfortunately the difficulty of obtaining spare parts and replacements for damaged materials has so far proved insuperable so that the position is not as satisfactory as couldbe desired. The difficulties of the Company*s administration are at least in part understood by their labour and the management have been advised by the PoliticauL Agent to obtain sanction to bring into operation, should it become necessary, increases in the war allowance of the lower pay grades. This action will probably have the effect of preventing a disruption in the Company's work until April 1st when it is anticipated the Refinery construction programme will have advanced sufficiently to permit of the discharge of some 2,000 locals employees and the return to the United States of America of approximately 300 men from the Berchtel McCone Corporation. The Company hope that the full programme for construction will be completed by the 1st of June.Telegram • 'Fr cm • To. Ho. ' !L £ copy \ -» 86/5. 3 ( 0 ).

There seemed to be two schools of thought with regard to the perpetrators of the outrage, the rnanage:-«ent of ihe Co r pary holding the view that it was undoubtedly the work of the rather rough Persian element who had been recruited recently for semi-skilled labour, while the Security Offioer took the view that the Persians would not be capable of the intelligence and forethought required nor did they knew where to obtain the abrasive and that it was probably the work of a non-Asiatic. The Bahrain Petroleum Company’s private police were investigating and the Security Officer was also giving considerable attention to the matter. SECRET£5940/128/25.

A meeting took place yesterday with Colonel Benisch of the United States Army who is returning from Washington to Bahrein to resume his duties as liaison officer. United States Petroleum Attache and a representative of India OH ice were also present. 2. Benisch when advised of latest developments endeavoured, somewhat aggressively, to discount the political objections to Italian artisans quoting in support his own experience (so far limited to four months on the island) and the views or tne Board of BAFCQ. It was pointed out in reply that the local manager of BAPCO had associated himself with the views o:. .the Political Resident which not only carried great weight with India Office but also coincided with their own. It was suggested to Beniscn that on his return to Bahrein he should try and find some compromise solution which would be agreeable to the local author! ties. He has a suggestion regarding segregation which he thinks important and which is mentioned under paragraph 3(b; of your telegram No. 671 [Elfu Nocop of 13th October.] India Office undertook to telegraph in advance to.Political # , Resident advising him of our London discussion and emphasising the i portance of making every possible (repeat possible )con- cession which might accelerate completion of the aviation plan t. 4. At this stage a telegram was received by the Petroleum Attache from P.A.W. stating that the matter would be settled by them with your assistance. We hope this means that the Iraqi alternative is now thought feasible. Benisch con*“ sidered it unlikely that it would be either feasible or adequate. We pointed out that a decision covering the use of Italians could only be taken in London. 5. Benisch is postponing his return to Bahrein until further advice is received from P.A.W.

Colonel jjenisch said that he had not heard of the proposal to inport Iraqis, but he was doubtful whether it would in any case meet BABOO’S needs. The requirements of coolie labour were considerably in excess of 1,000, and even if the Iraqis were added to 1,000 Bahreini labourers, the total would still fall short of requirements* Colonel Benisoh said that all possible sources of labour had been explored, and the Italians seemed to be the only solution. It would not be possible to send American artisans because there would only be tented accos^nodation at Bahrein, and Americans would not be content frith this. Colonel benisch suggested that if the matter were put to him in the right light, the BheiJdi’a objections to Italians might be overcome. In reply to Colonel Benisch, it was stressed that the Sheikh’s objections to Italians were certainly real, and that we entirely accepted the advice of our local political authorities who had considerably greater experience of dealing with Arabs in these matters than even the local representatives of the American oil occqranies, H.M,C. considered that in view of their long term interests that were involved, it would bequite ijsqaosaihle to fortie the Issue with the cnmz this matter of Italians, There were other things to consider besides oil t notably our use of Bahrein as an air-port, in which connection we were also to a large ... extent dependent on the maintenance of good relations with the Bheikh, In any case, there was still the proposal for the iaportation of Iraqis to be considered, and it was hoped that this would meet essential requirements.

To answer your paragraph 2 the reasons for which Sheikh strongly resists importations of Italians are quoted by the Political Resident as follows: (a) There is a strongly ingrained feeling amongst the Arabs that Italians are dishonourable and unreliable. They have not forgotten or forgiven Italian air-raid during Ramazan in 1941, (b) Sheikh could therefore not consent willingly and his subjects would never believe that he had done so. Full blame would therefore fall on His Majesty's Government, 3 # Apart from the above Sheikh considers that if BAPCO temporarily raise their wage rates they would soon attract sufficient labour to meet the deficit. In any case he considers ( and Political Agent agrees) that at least 1,000 additional labourers will be available on the return or the pearling fleet at the end of October. 4. Political Resident adds that the security position in Bahrein is already unsatisfactory rnd importation of large numbers of Italians whose presence would be strongly resented by local inhabitants would almost certainly give rise to serious incidents which would react on BAPCO themselves. 5. India Office fully endorse the views of the Political Resident, n Under those circumstances I feci that despite our earnest desire to help, the Italian proposal must be dropped, I am glad to think that the Iraqi artisans should provide a way out.

(b) ”BAPC0 advises that the ending of pearling season will to some extent relieve native labour shortage but it will not lessen the need for additional semi skilled labour, the necessity for which has become emphasised as the result of recent loss of material due to enemy action”. (c) That the United States military authorities have again emphasised that earliest possible completion of project is essential to the war programme. S.

(b) Establishing terms of employment to confine the Italians to designated part of the island and making breach of this agreement or any improper conduct cause for immediate discharge and deportation. 4.

It must be remembered that Arabs regard Italians from totally different point of view . to ourselves and cannot understand clemency (? shov/n) to them. 2 . Following ere reasons given by Sheikh for his refusal:- (a) in opinion of (? all) Arabs Italians were' dishonourable people in whom no trust should be reposed. f his people had not forgotten or forgiven air raid on Bahrain in Ramazan 1941.

T t th September, 19Vf« lett^£| 4Cd.3eptei her 2J»ra and two ?V; A'' Or In a general way this Ministry is very anxious to do all it can to help alleviate the BABCO labour problems with a view to the earliest possible completion of the aviation spirit plant. Our reasons for doing so are firstly that requirements of aviation spirit are still in excess of supply and, secondly, because the Americans deliver so much Lend/Lease aviation spirit to the British forces, that it is '.up to us to help them in the production of this fuel within ithe British sphere of influence. I cannot say in answer to your question whether the 9 months delay in the completion of the Bahrein aviation plant is solely due to labour shortages. We have, however, since June/July of this year been acquainted with these deficiencies in labour and have been doing what we can to help by con- sidering possibilities of releasing men working on the K . A .F. Schema in Bahrein. As you know, the prospects of importing Iraq labour have also been considered, but turned down on political grounds. There is one point on which I am not quite clear. In a telegram from our representative in Bagdad dated July 22fth it was stated ’’labour must be released soon to be of any sub stantial benefit as- we anticipate that by October labour shortage will he largely alleviated' (owing to the temination-- ! of the pearling season). The present suggestion to send 700 to a 1000 Italians from Eritrea is based on their arrival by December 1st, when it is estimated that they could curtail the/* - 2 - the construction period hy one month. This does not seem consistent with the earlier statements from Bagda-^^ To revert to the plant question, although there have doubtless been some delays in the supply of the equipment from the U.S #&gt; it must he assumed that there is now more equipment on the spot or in sight than there is labour for construction purposes. If, therefore, there is any prospect of overcoming the Sheikh's objections to Italian artisans, we would recommend that everything possible should be done to clear the way for the Italians. This is -particularly so as Washington telegram from our office No. 1309 Elfu XL, of which you have a copy, states that 'in anticipation of favourable action preliminary steps are being taken by United States agencies for trans portation of bedding, messing etc. for these Italian^'. Although I note from the attachments to your letter that BAPCO have telegraphed to their New York office recommending that the Italian proposal should be dropped, I would be grateful if you could give us your own view as to the chances of a reconsideration of his decision by the Sheikh and any background information as to the reasons for his attitude which we could usefully p&gt;ass on to Washington to nake the position more palatable to the Americans.

DAYPS My telegram No* 974* I have given you the official views of His Majesty’s Government as represented by the Inaia Office and War Office on the specific questions put to us in your telegram No* 678 paragraph 4* For your own infomation the Government of India in reply to the telegram sent to them stated that - 'We find it difficult to comprehend why United States of America Government and Bahrein Petroleum Company are unable to come to some satisfactory contractual agreement by which United States of America Government provides 100% finance while plant itself is property of the Company. The latter s obligations would be discharged by assigning profits on operation and by release of the plant for removal by United States of America Government when no longer required at Bahrein* The 100 octane plant would definitely have to be operated as an integral part of Bahrein refinery and would almost certainly be located in the area reserved for refinery. We fail to see how Bahrein Petroleum Company concession could cover United States of America Government’s ownership of property in refinery area. A further complication would arise in that operation of United States of America Government owned unit in refinery would for practical purposes deprive paragraph No.2 of Schedule of Political Agreement of all value'.. The views of the Government of India are shared by the Political Resident and in regard to the question of the effect of the erection of the 100 octane plant on crude from the Bahrein field, he states that - 'Arabian crude oil will be used mainly if not exclusively for production of aviation spirit'. The Political Resident remarks that the Manager of the Company is telegraphing to New York on this point. You will appreciate from the foregoing the reasons for the delay which has occurred in replying to your telegram. The constitution of Bahrein is somewhat peculiar and although.for. many purposes it ranks as a British Protectorate, the Sheikh is. regarded as an independent sovereign. . Matters affecting Bahrein have therefore to be handled with considerable care. The question of the importance of Bahrein as a source of oil supplies is fully appreciated here, and in any schemes for the defence of the Persian Gulf area it is given equal precedence with Abadan. I hope the informationnow given will enable a decision to be reached since we are most anxious to have this question disposed of. INDIV.1 ■! ^ ^ 7 ^ /vt «7*-i Under Secretary of State . VvA Dj J C-l b h 1 The letter from the Petroleum Department of June 25 th below relates to a proposal for erecting a special plant at Bahrein for the production of 100 - 0 ctane aviation fuel, •• The Petroleum Department have told us orally that this scheme has been discussed for some time between the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the British and U.S. authorities in Washington.- The : Company, who do not consider that the plant has commercial possibilities after the war, have taken a long time to reach a decision with regard to the financing of the project, and have now stipulated that they will only proceed if it is financed wholly by the U.S. Government. (The Petroleum Department letter assumes that this would imply ownership of the plant being vested in that Government). Apparently, however, the U.S. authorities are under the impression that it is the British who are making difficulties, and the Petroleum Department are therefore anxious to remove this impression by replying with as little delay as possible to the two questions asked by the U.S. Secretary for War (see foot of telegram from W ew York dated June 23 rd, a copy of which was enclosed with Petroleum Department letter). This anxiety is increased by the fact that they consider that this additional source of aviation fuel would be a valuable asset to our war effort. Question' (a) asked by the Secretary for War is a matter for the War Office and the C.in.C. Middle East, who is responsible for the defence of the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms. Our latest information (dated May 8 th) is that the active defence of the Oilfields and ^finery area lis entrusted to a force of Bahreinis under an Arab ex-officer of the Iraq Levies^vvith two obsolete A.A. guns; and that the question/question of a regular garrison was under discussion between the Service Chiefs in Cairo. As regards question (b) we have consulted the Covemirent of India and the Political Resident, whose views will be found telofr. It will be seen that the Political Residerixtsees no difficulty with the Sheikh, provided that the Company (who are consulting their Head Office on the point) can give a satisfactory assurance that, although the crude oil from which the aviation spirit will* be refined will be derived'chiefly from the mainland of Saudi-Arabia, production from the Bahrein field will not be reduced. In this connection the Political Resident draws attention to a statement'*’ by :the Shiekh in 1935 that he had no objection to the refinihg'in Bahrein of oil from outside, but that he did not wish the quantity of oil produced in- Bahrein to be diminished. t t « On the question whether there is any objection to the technical ownership of the plant by the U.S. Government, the Government of India and the Political Resident are agreed that vis-a-vis the Bahrein Government the plant should be treated as the property of the Company. The Political Resident points out * that if this is done it is extremely improbable that any problem relating to the acquisitionisv of feaie land etc., for the project will arise, since Article 2 of the Company's lease of 1934 (flagged) gives them very ample rights in this respect. The Government of India make the point that ownership by the U.S.Government would prevent H.I.I.G. from taking advantage, should they so desire, of paragraph 2 of the Schedule to their Political Agreement with the Company, which provides for the taking over by H.M.G. of the Company's works, plant and premises. The Government of India, therefore, suggest that the U.S. Government should be urged to come to some arrangement with the Company whereby, &lt; * (r*^ . 2 i, ^&gt;7. AW ? ^ ^ iP 1 . j - U L. ^ ^ . P* £ ' /v '—for/ ouu. stlk kA. SUfor the purpose of the lattefs concessional relations with the Sheikh, the plant would become the Company’s property. It is proposed to ask the Petroleum Department to pass on this suggestion to the U.S. authorities, pointing out to them that such an arrangement would facilitate the acquisition of any land needed for the scheme.^ The-details of the arrangement - possibly a sort ofXlease/lend - cafifc* be left to be settled in the U.S. A draft in this sense is submitted.DRAFT LETTER SECRET - UVUMEDIATK BY HAND. t.

Dear Starling In Peel's absence on leave I am replying to your letter to him of June 25 th about the proposal to erect at Bahrein a plant for the production of aviation fuel. You will have had a copy of our telegram No.11453 of June 27 th consulting the Government of India and the Political Resident on this proposal, and you will have seen advance copies of their replies. For convenience I enclose further copies of the latter. You will see that, subject to the Company's being able to confirm that the production of oil from the Bahrein field will not be affected, no £ difficulty of any kind with the Sheikh is fo^seen Moreover, neither the Government of India northe Political Resident see any other objection to the scheme, provided that some arrangement can be t • * • c ♦ made between the U.S. Government and the Company whereby, for the purpose of the latter'-s -concessional relations with the Sheikh, the plant would be treated c as the Company’s property* The Secretary of State egrees with these views, and hopac that the—Petroleum Be par tir.cirfc wi-11 fesl able tP.r\W sV.cWd advvbti *^OkV j.e prooeedodTWl thy they should some arrangement of this kind&gt; ^Vp ouggoot therjf^h^ ; cai\i^ fairly be left to work out the details with the Company. It might be pointed out to them that such an arrangement would facilitate the acquisition of any land needed for the project, since under Article 2 of their lease of 1934 the Company enjoy®, extensive rights in this respect. The reference in paragraph 2 of the Political Resident’s telegram is to paragraph 4 of a letter dated October 10th, 1935, from the Sheikh to the Political Resident. This paragraph reads as follows:- c n l±. We have no objection to the refiningmmmmm ■■■■! 'in Bahrein of oil from outside. We do not 'wish, hov/ever, that the quantity of oil which 'is produced in Bahrein should diminish.' With regard to the last paragraph of your letter, we have already told you orally that our latest information about the active defence of Bahrein comes from your Department; and that the questions of policing during construction and active military protection afterwards are for the War Office# Yours sincerely, ISd.)

At one time there was a suggestion that the British Government should contribute to the cost of installing the plant, but you will see that thegiahrein Petroleum Company have now I stipulated that they areTwilling to proceed on the basis of 100?2 financing by the United States Government. We have expressed our approval of the idea to provide additional lOO-octane fuel, and I should be grateful if you could let me know as soon as you can whether you would wish to say anything in regard to para. 4(b) of the telegram. I imagine there would be no difficulty in granting facilities to the U.S. authorities in the way of grants of land, wayleaves, etc. The new plant would be situated close to the existing refinery and would really work as a part of that refineiy. I imagine also that there would be no difficulty raised by the local government over the ownership of the plant being vested in the United States Government. I am having enquiries made about the point raised in para. 4(a), but if you could help on this point also I should be Al grateful. I believe we have some active defence at Bahrein in ' connection with the existing oil installations.

Both projects have been reviewed by Overseas Purchasing Commission from a technical point of vie - and they confirm both processes as having been thoroughly proven through operations in the United States and production and quality of resulting products can be accepted without further question. 2. The first alternative would produce 4,166 barrels per diem with an investment of ?l4,215,000, while the second proposal would produce 1,466 barrels for an investment of iaS, 924,000* 3. In submitting these proposals the Bahrein Company stipulate that they are v/illing to proceed only on basis of 10C$ financing by the United States Government* 4. There have subsequently been discussions between Overseas' Purchasing Commission and the War Department in order to sound the willingness or otherwise of the War Department to erect plant on account of United States Army* The matter is finally being personally considered by . Patterson under the Secretary to:: Y/ar. However before going any further the latter wishes definite advice from ourselves on two points: (a) The intentions of the British Government in regard to providing adequate protection both policing during construction and military after construction, (b) Yfhether the British Government have any comments or views in regard to United States Government’s erecting this plant in manner contemplated above.

In the first pl^ce the new pi out will not be reedy before August as the material due from Ceraany is bein^ delayed for l«ck of raw materials! also soiae of the stuff from meric a seems to have been in a ship which went ground somewhere in the Pacific. The spirit which will be produced from the new polymerisation plant le a motor spirit and will not qualify exactly as an aviation spirit. The motor spirit will hove an octane of 80 to 86 and lifter being blended with reformed spirit will have e vapour pressure of about 9 l^s. Although it is not a pure aviation spirit it can prooobly be leaded up to an octane of about 90 but will still have rather a high vapour oresmire (I think about ? lbs) end higher fractional points than normal aviation spirit. Nevertheless although such a spirit doaa not give 100 per cent efficiency in n aeroplane engine using say a 87 oct^me aviation spirit* it will certainly &gt;e ode mate for normal functioning.

BEPT. 7 NOV1938 INDIA OFFICEDear Sir Trenchard, M ~ I mon,:at other precautions taken here during the emergency period before the Munich Conference, X thought it advisable to ascertain from the Bahrein Petroleum Com pany whether they could produce, in esse of need, aviation spirit comparable vrith the Wo types used by Imperial Air ways - and also, I understand, by the Poyal Air Force for their older machines. Bhese two types have octane values of 87 and 74 respectively. The point I had in mind was that, in spite of precautions being taken, stocks of aviation spi rit in Bahrain might be destroyed by sabotage and there mi rht well be difficulties In replenishing stocks from Abadan. 2. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have now Informed me that although their present plant cannot produce spirit with an octane of 87, they can, with the addition of 3 c.c. of load per 17. S. gallon, oroduce an octane of 83 with a vapour pressure of 5£ lbs* Octane can be Increased to 86.7 by adding 6 c.c. o t lend, but I gather thst this is unsound practice and the vapour pressure goes up to 7 lbs. 3. The emergency having passed this matter is only of epi rs*l interest. Khat is of much greeter interest is that l have been informed that the Bahrain Petroleum Company have completed their deslrns for a polymerisation plant to be 1natalled here to make high octane motor and aviation Ibel, and that materials have already been ordered.

Dear Peel, ^0.4 ^ X 1 W In reply to your letter of the 22nd April enclosing copy of a telegramJ^SO^Lfrom the Government of India dated 20th April, we do not seem to have had any recent correspondence from you on this matter and have not seen the United States ^irhassy letter to the Foreign Office dated 8 th February; but there is no doubt that the additional facilities for oil refining which are referred to are those for the production of 100-octane aviation fuel. We know that this plant has now been approved by the U.S. Authorities, and presumably some means have been found of overcoming the difficulties which were referred to in the earlier telegrams and with which we dealt specifically in our telegram to Washington No.l Fuelnocop, copy of which I sent to you with my letter of 23rd July last. •\ Incidentally, we did not have any copies of your reply to the ^ telegram of 5th July No.5221. I do not know whether you wish me to comment on the suggestion that the Americans should be allowed to open a consulate in Bahrein. The only thing I can usefully say, since it apparently rests on the employment of more Americans, is that during the period of construction a considerable number of personnel will undoubtedly be required and, to judge by our experience in other matters, I have no doubt the United States Authorities will wish these to be Americans. Actually, at Abadan where we have had large extensions we had to secure the* services of about 100 American technicians with special knowledge. Yours sincerely, R. T.

CON- 163. E.B.Wakefield Esq., His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, The Agency, Bahrain, Dear Sir, Please refer to my letter CON-126 of July 1st 1942 which transmitted a draft of a message to Mr.Herron, President of the Bahrain Petroleum Company New York, as follows*- '795 Political Agent on behalf of Shaikh wishes assurance that production of oil from Bahrain Field will not be adversely affected as a result of contemplated manufacture Aviation Gasoline Bahrain Refinery also would you normally expect increased production Bahrain Crude after completion proposed new facilities. Appreciate your early reply - Ward Anderson' I have received the following reply from Mr.Herron in answer to the above query«- '357 - Refer your telegram 795 - Installation of equipment to manufacture aviation gasoline will not substantially affect present crude production Bahrain of 15000 barrels daily. If any effect we estimate slight increase crude production. Only positive way we can increase crude pro duction is by substantial increase of outlets for motor gasoline, kerosene, diesel and fuels as discussed my con fidential cable June 26th regarding decreased outlets.' The context of Mr. Herron's confidential cable of June 26th referred to above was given in my letter to you CON-116 of June 28th 1942. I I trust that the above statement of Mr.Herron is satisfactory to the Shaikh and to H.M.'s Government and that it will disperse any fears that the Shaikh may have that the installation of equipment for the manufacture of Aviation Gasoline would adversely affect the Crude production from the Bahrain Field.

My dear Peel ' y J.S.IAI In connection with our recent correspondence about the proposal m to erect a plant for the production of aviation fuel at Bahrein, you may like to have for your records copies of two telegrams which were sent to the British Petroleum ] ission. The FTJTL NOCOP series is one which we have recently instituted because we exchange our FUEL telegrams with United States oil representatives over here, while the FUEL NOCOP series will be limited to circulation to British Government Departments. The Head of the British Petroleum Iviission, in conversation with me on the telephone a few days ago, said that our views had been passed on to the United States Authorities, but present indications I were that they foresaw great difficulty in not vesting the property in the plant in the United States Government. I warned Jilkinson that this was likely to give rise to further difficulty and delay, and we can only wait until we get their official reactions. Yours sincerely, R. T.

No. 87L FUEL XL. 16th July, 19L2. MOST IMMEDIATE. SECRET. D. 9.10 p.ra. 16th July, 19L2. JJJJ Following for Wilkinson from Starling. My telegram No. 678 Elfu XL. sir c. KISCH MR. STARLING MR. BRIDGEMAN MR. COLEMAN MR. BUTLER MR. BARNETT MR. ELLIS m. DAYfS We have now received the views of the India Office, who are responsible for the area in question, and also of the War Office. We have already expressed our general approval of the Bahrein project and, since the proposal now is that the plant should be financed entirely by the United States Government we do not feel able to comment on the question whether the plant should be of the larger or the smaller size. The India Office have obtained the views of the Government of India and of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The India Office views are:- (a) Subject to the Company being able to confirm that the production of oil from the Bahrein field will not be affected, no difficulty with the Sheikh is foreseen (understand that local Manager is cabling New York on this point), (b) It is hoped that some arrangement can be made between the United States Government and the Company whereby, for the purpose of the latter^ concessional relations with the Sheikh, the plant would be treated as the Company's property. Such an arrangement would facilitate the acquisition of any land needed for the project, since under Article 2 of their lease of 193X the Company enjoy extensive rights in this respect. As regards paragraph X(a) of your telegram under reply the War Office consider that the existing native police forces,supplemented if necessary by a defence force recruited from white Company personnel, will be sufficient for policing during construction. With regard to protection when complete, the War Office point out that this forms part of the question of the defence of Bahrein generally and can only be considered as part of complete scheme for defence of Persian Gulf oil area, plans for which are constantly under review and must be dictated by the circumstances at any given time. In these circumstances, the War Office regret that it is not possible to give undertaking regarding specific forces for guarding plant when completed. They feel sure United States Government will appreciate the situation.
